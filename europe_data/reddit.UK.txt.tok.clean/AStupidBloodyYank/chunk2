  are you talking about how they 'll end up giving more sovereignty to the eu ? 
  how is that a plus for scottish nationalists ? 
  just like the eu convincing people that its actually doing well . 
  one of the bigger member states votes to leave the eu because of apparent encroachment on sovereignty from the eu . 
  the eu 's answer ? 
  more europe !, 
  take more sovereignty !, 
  yes , cognitive dissonance is the phrase of the year ... for all sides !, 
   the uk has no such safeguard , and trump is probably the best argument there is for the virtues of a written constitution . 
  because the uk does n't directly elect the head of state . 
  yes , the uk does n't have the same safeguards as the us does in regards to the supreme court . 
  that being said , the differences of the electoral system in the uk lend itself to *** not *** having someone like trump seize power . 
  again , the uk is more based on symbolism since it is pretty damn difficult for a populist to seize power over there - due to the inherent nature of the parliamentary system . 
  plus , the queen has final say on all acts ; a power she has never used but is the ultimate `` check '' on parliament . 
  and she would definitely use it if she thought parliamentary democracy was under threat - since the army report to her and not parliament . 
  however , the uk is a largely homogenous , tiny island while the us is a multicultural continental superstate - so what works for one does n't work for the other . 
  i shall definitely give them a read , thanks for the links !, 
  my point here is that uk law ( much like its politics ) is ** more ** based on symbolism - and while a ruling government could definitely make all conflicting laws redundant with a new law ; the political backlash would be insane and would probably collapse the government . 
  this is where civil society steps in - a very effective check & balance in the past . 
  the high court can rule that this current act is in fact contrary to plenty of previous parliamentary acts , and i expect to see - within a few months - a high court case challenging this current act over privacy concerns . 
  at which point , the high court will rule that this act does in fact conflict with another and will make the act redundant . 
  shit happens all the time . 
  so did i say there was a judicial review or not ? 
  once reviewing my post you 'll notice i did not in fact clarify that ; so you 're assuming something never said ... . good job there . 
  no , someone will take this law to the high court and the high court will rule against it ... . as the law itself clearly ignores huge swathes of current parliamentary law . 
   a negative influence in the eu regarding privacy i still think the uk was a net positive for eastern europe . 
   i do n't think you are very familiar with the law yourself , certainly not american law . 
  is this a shitty attempt to establish your authority on the subject or are you genuinely needlessly antagonistic ? 
  do i need to write out all the pros & cons of a written and unwritten constitution ? 
   we have a written constitution is because the abuses of the british that notwithstanding , we ( us americans ) seem to be pretty good at circumventing our constitution . 
   if you had a constitutional right to privacy ? 
  which will be established when these laws are smashed in the high court - like every other single time the government has tried to pass these laws in the uk . 
  because uk law uses case law as legal precedent just like * drumroll * the us !, 
   things like banning commercially filming facesitting is just amusing , things like the government being entitled to your browsing history without a warrant is terrifying . 
  again - for someone who claims to know a lot about common law ; how can you not see that this *** will *** be decided in the high court ( and they most definitely will overturn it ) . 
  member ' when the british government thought they did n't have to consult parliament to trigger article 50 ? 
  member ' what happened ? 
  oh yeah , the high court struck it down , and now parliament has to vote on triggering article 50 . 
  my question to you , mr.other-american-on-a-non-american-subreddit is , what use is a written constitution if our president willfully disregards it and tries to undermine it ? 
  i really do n't think us americans should be lecturing anyone on `` sticking to their constitution '' when our president regularly shits on our one - through making comments that are not grounded in any reading of the constitution ( i.e has never read our constitution ) . 
  yeh thats the reason lol . 
  anyone with an inkling of knowledge of constitutional law knows that an unwritten constitution has pros & cons just like a written one . 
  if you seriously think this 'll pass a high court ( read : supreme court ) hearing then you 're delusional lol . 
  yes , we americans got case law from the british - and it still works in merry old england . 
  same country also lobbied for romania to join the eu - contrary to what the french and germans wanted . 
  i would n't so gleefully welcome the uk leaving if i were eastern european lol . 
  it would be obvious to anyone capable of rational thought that i do n't . 
  i 'll spell things out for you more clearly in future to account for this problem of yours . 
  quite the grandiose view your have of yourself there do n't you ? 
  by spelling things out , you mean not even entertaining counter-claims ? 
  great job being objective there . 
   that the pounds was overvalued , nobody in the uk cared until it had already fallen and they were in damage control mode . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  i 've literally called for this for years lol . 
   a nice alternative fact you have there . 
  i would accuse you of being a presumptuous twat , but knowing that you ca n't think coherently for more than one step , it is clear how you get so much wrong and insulted so easily . 
  oh cool , so you throw in a topical jab and then insult me to hide behind your lack of intellectual capacity !, 
   i would keep chatting , but trying to have a reasonable discussion with you is a waste of time . 
  so now you flee because you 've insulted someone . 
  face it bruv : you cover your lack of intellectual reasoning with insults ... and its pathetic !, 
  because thats what i 'm saying lol . 
  either way ; whether germany likes it or not , it is going to have to make some serious decisions the next few years - your ambivalence in that regard is rather disconcerting to say the least . 
   another leaver that confuses 5 mins with 50 years . 
  presumptuous , inaccurate , hypocritical . 
  so you agree that the remain camp was supranationalist , and out right lying about leaving the eu ? 
  excellent !, 
   ah yes , that old line . 
  funny how that was not an issue until after it fell . 
  what is n't an issue ? 
  you think the uk made all of our national wealth from being apart of the eu ? 
  lol !, 
   presumptuous , inaccurate , hypocritical . 
  exactly what i was thinking about you . 
  your ivory tower attitude is really quite loathsome . 
  i have yet to see you be objective and not just slinging infantile insults . 
  but then again , you make it easy to see straight through your agenda . 
  you do n't give af about objectivity ; only insulting people and writing walls of text in support of what you voted for in the referendum . 
  i try to be objective by seeing the to other sides points ( since ya know , the idea that one side should be cut out of the decision-making process is exactly the reason why i voted leave ) but people like you make it hard ... . to say the least . 
  every day i 'm browsing my subreddits , i see you writing walls of text , and generally going around picking fights . 
  how do you keep on top of 30 + different arguments a day btw ? 
  such amazing productivity in arguing lol . 
  nope not really . 
  nice attempt at changing the conversation though . 
  the cancer of the mind you speak of is assuming ww3 would 've been avoided *** without *** nukes . 
   i see you like to mischaracterise things prove that remain was n't supranationalist and lying through their teeth with fake statistics ( of which none have come to pass ) . 
  oh wait , you ca n't . 
   still looking for a solid positive , nothing has stood up to scrutiny or not emerged due to other factors . 
  the pound was overvalued . 
  now it is not . 
  you really think we should base our currency on the takings of a 400 year imperialist rampage instead of , say , our actual economic configuration ? 
   projection . 
  haha nice attempt . 
  the fact is , is that you never , ever , ever post anything objective about brexit ; because you 're not objective . 
   your username , as has been established before , is highly relevant . 
  i thought so as well , hence me choosing my username . 
   i have a problem with anti-intellectualism , nationalism and poor reasoning . 
  i have a problem with supranationalism , bold-face lying , and lacklustre defense of liberal democratic principles : i.e the remain side . 
   i will gladly point out the consequences of this , as is our duty as citizens of the uk . 
  only if they 're negative and only if they fit your narrative . 
  you are not objective in the slightest and the attempt to paint yourself as such is incredibly misleading at best and just straight lying through your teeth at worse .
