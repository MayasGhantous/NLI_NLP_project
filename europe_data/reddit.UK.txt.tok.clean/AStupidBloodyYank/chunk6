  what a well thought-out point !, 
  you truly are lucifers attorney !, 
   free trade through the wto , but the negotiations for that were unsuccessful because rich countries would n't stop subsidizing their agricultural sector , and refused to remove the tariffs ( specifically the french :p ) the eu has n't even got a trade deal with any of the major economies bar mexico . 
  therefore , it seems unlikely that the eu will get a `` speedy '' deal with japan , india , china , indonesia , brazil etc etc etc http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/agreements/#_other-countries, 
  i really think any headline claiming `` record highs '' in terms of population is a misnomer : ofc its a record high !, 
  the world population is increasing is n't it ? 
  then every one of these statistics will always be `` record high !! '', 
  oh because the eu forcing uk media companies to surrender their free speech rights wo n't go down like an absolute shit show lol, 
  its because all the smart people do n't get involved in politics :p, 
  this sums up the uk in a sentence, 
   but what incentive do the germans have with trump antagonizing them ? 
  none at all ; i 'm saying they have an incentive in keeping the cohesion of the eu by doing so . 
  this is one of the reasons i support brexit : the uk was obdurate in the eu , and ultimately if there are going to be any solutions - it requires more political integration for france and germany . 
  it 's the only solution and its a roll of the dice . 
   a concept difficult to apprehend to the anglo-saxons it seems a concept that is n't hard for anglo-saxons is that the germans have an artificially low currency that makes their superior manufacturing output artificially cheap . 
  obama repeatedly asked germany to rein in the surplus - and they ignored him repeatedly . 
  ofc the us is going to protect its agricultural industry - what foolish country would n't ? 
  how about eu services tariffs ? 
  great attempt at changing the conversation !, 
  i 've repeatedly said the us is n't a saint in this regard ; perhaps you missed this point i made over and over and over again . 
  furthermore , the eu ( specifically germany ) have been racking up trade surpluses and ensnaring countries in debt traps since 2009 - if which is a perfect example of a state maximizing its power and not acting altruistically . 
  compared to 2.5 % ( the us car tariffs ) it 's actually pretty big . 
  none lol - of all the advanced economies though the eu is right up there with japan in their protectionism . 
  the us is n't a saint by any means but compared to those two , they are far more open to free trade . 
  meh ... he does a lot of things . 
  ultimately , the eu had no interest in it as well . 
   free trade is an empty phrase haha cute . 
  no , free trade means the unregulated flow of goods and services between two countries . 
  nice try though . 
   nobody actually wants it or uses it . 
  not the us , not the uk , not the eu , nobody . 
  thats not true at all lol . 
  the thing is with free trade is that if it were implemented correctly between advanced economies - and rigorously enforced - it would raise living standards and wages immeasurably . 
  the fact is , is that the eu can claim that its free trade all it wants but ( ignoring ag because tbh the americans are just as bad the eu in this regard ) the facts on the ground point to the eu stacking the deck in a range of industries ( mainly manufacturing though ) and refusing to open up their markets to services . 
  so a deal for the eu is let us trade our manufactured goods for your manufactured goods - that is all . 
   well of course the eu protects their core industries . 
  this does n't mean that it ca n't be a staunch supporter of free trade . 
  i 'm an absolutist in regards to free trade . 
  tariffs and regulatory barriers in effect prop up industries - whether they 're competitive or not . 
   if other countries protect their core industries but the eu does n't , that would result in a huge economic disadvantage . 
  that maybe the case but ultimately the eu is by far the worst culprit for this in terms of advanced economies . 
   when other countries give up on protectionist meassures the eu is willing to do the same . 
  nope . 
  the eu has repeatedly been obdurate in this regard - in fact its written into wto rules . 
  ultimately the us is wrong with its sanctions but is *** far more *** open to free trade than the eu is . 
  granted , trump has won election , but what does the wto schedule look like ? 
  my hope is my two countries ( us and uk ) within the next 20 years move towards complete and open free trade - the problem is the statists like the eu , china , russia , and india . 
  yeh its pretty nuts ; the eu claims to be a staunch supporter of free trade but then has a 10 % tariff on imported cars - probs some regulatory barriers as well - whereas the us has a 2.5 % tariff . 
  but lets not fuck over this circlejerk right lads ? 
   europe wo n't be a lapdog any more . 
  cuz europe always handles itself so well when left to its own devices . 
   compare this to us where right to privacy is essentially non-existent by european standards you mean except the 4th amendment in the us constitution that specifically details out your `` right to privacy '' ?? 
  yeh i do n't really either ; i think people were just incensed about the thought of having to buy a mandatory id card . 
  as in , they thought the whole thing reeked of a nanny state and then to add insult to injury you had to buy it . 
  plus people in the uk are like anonymity a lot - ca n't speak for the rest of europe but i imagine there are similar veins of thought . 
  nevermind !, 
   maybe i should have some american styled name i mean i am just a stupid bloody yank tho lol :p ( 50/50 actually but nvm )  health wealth and happiness to you and yours !, 
  and to you mate !!!, 
  yeh i saw that when u posted the first time bruv, 
  yeh rounding up that many in a week from cctv is definitely impressive . 
  glad u agree !, 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/3000-arrests-in-london-riots-investigation-2366933.html literally two seconds of google-fu - its very easy to use a search engine do n't you know ? 
   get those convictions rounding up means arresting - to which they arrested thousands within a week of the riots . 
  and they rounded up thousands in 1 week, 
  in a pinch it shows what can be done - without much investment by the state . 
  meh , they managed to catch 90 % of the culprits of the london riots in 2011 using cctv - by being able to follow people all the way back to their doors and identifying them through gait etc. 
  so not sure where you 're getting your info from :p not that i agree with cctv - just saying . 
  yeh i get that . 
  one caveat about the cctv tho ; the systems are mostly owned by private citizens who `` hand over the tapes '' to the police when they 're doing an investigation . 
  i think you 're missing the point here ; mandatory id cards - in the uk - are seen as some dastardly despotic plot to rob people of their freedom . 
  and the fn was founded by vichy collaborators . 
  which is worse ? 
  obviously the fn winning 35 % of the vote is far more terrifying than a crackpot bunch of racists winning 1.7 % of the vote ... . . once ... ... a decade ago . 
  and owned by someone who trump has gotten into protracted twitter duels with . 
   nato has n't . 
  without the security umbrella from nato , the eu *** would *** not have formed . 
  it 's nato and mad that kept europe from tearing itself apart again - the eu only exists because nato and mad created the conditions for it to arise . 
  while it would be nice to think that the eu & un have done more for europe than nato and self-preservation ; this is the wrong lesson to learn from the past 70 years . 
   not because our ancestors were all especially hateful or stupid no , they just enslaved the planet , stole their resources , and committed genocide . 
  whatevs right ? 
  exactly . 
  i voted leave mainly because we just fuck everything up in the eu and actually prevent it from integrating further - which while it may be a long shot ; i think is the only way to deal with the multitude of crises confronting them . 
  i 'm not salty about the eu , just that the uk consistently wants to throw a proverbial spanner in the works to prevent integration . 
  any brit wishing for the collapse of the eu is moronic lol . 
  jacob just remembers the good ole ' days in the early 19th century, 
  oh just like he was very popular in the uk , and him wading in turned a bunch of undecideds to vote for brexit ? 
  obama fucked this election - i 'm bracing for le pen now :(, 
  [ i 'm just going to leave this here ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/139/571/b03.png ), 
   i want them to feel the effects of the ramifications of what they did let 's just hope that we proverbially stake their heads at the tower . 
   especially when no country seems to want to rush into an agreement with us ikr , these twats willingly said that then backpedalled . 
  standard shit m8 . 
  they did say it , and i hate the both of them for it . 
  i did vote for brexit , but decoupling yourself from the facts is not the way to build consensus domestically with people who voted remain - like yourself . 
  ca n't even have an honest conversation if the leave side does n't admit that bojo and farage were total twats and need to be excluded from the rest of the process . 
  cool , i guess me growing up in southern england compared to you in scotland obviously shows it differences !, 
  fancy that !, 
  meh , i do what i can to confuse people, 
  it 's not a case of `` who is a true brit '' , more that the people i talked to have been consistent in wanting to leave the single market whereas farage and bojo ... ... ... . . not so much :p, 
  why is a european saying y' all ? 
  are you from texas or some shit ?
