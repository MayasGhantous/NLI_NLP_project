  stop abusing the `` muh lower classes will benefit '' rhetoric a la communists . 
   same with trump voters who rely on obamacare please tell me why obamacare is so important . 
  so the uk will , rightly , use it as a bargaining chip come trade negotiations ? 
  there 'll probably be a hongkong or singapore-style solution for london . 
  if things go well for both parties . 
   there was always a third option ( and still is on the table ) : just fake it . 
  change everything just enough that the leavers would have something to see see , it 's this kind of anti-democratic rhetoric from remainers which spurred this shit . 
  the `` we know better '' coming from folk like you was used to paint the entire eu as anti-freedom . 
  anyone who does n't vote for lack of pleasant weather does n't deserve to have their vote count anyway . 
  if the leave camp said such shit , we 'd be laughing at the idiocy and you know it . 
  may . 
  may day . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  only russia is as belligerent as china . 
  china is usurping territory and resources from angola to chile . 
  central asia is rapidly becoming a collection of satellite states , with chinese trade , access to ports via highways built on disputed territory and surgical applications of soft power diplomacy . 
  they are already indirectly negotiating with both pakistan linked terrorists and the afghan government to secure mining rights , and are developing in troubled areas all over the ` stans . 
  i am entirely sympathetic to the us here and wish the reagan-bush squad had done more for afghanistan . 
  which the oil deprived russians need . . 
   had/has a lot of strategic value in the central asian ambitions for both the us and the russian empire/ussr ( reaching the indian ocean afghanistan is landlocked . 
  its connection to india was lost to then us affiliated pakistan decades before the whole thing . 
  everything . 
  sykes picot underlies everything from the kurdistan problem and rushed self-determination to the rise of the saudis and wahhabi philosophy . 
  it paved the way for syed qutb , the muslim brotherhood , the notion of moderates being western slaves and more . 
  then there 's ww1 and removing the caliph . 
  kuwait , israel and the suez crisis exacerbated shit . 
  you do n't get a mideast level of tinderbox in one generation . 
  i 've not even touched upon british attempts at an afghan buffer when they controlled sindh or the anti-russia posturing of the time . 
  the mujahideen were enemies of the taliban . 
  their remnants still are . 
  osama bin laden 's rationale had started off much before . 
  it went all the way back to anglo-french control of an insolvent egyptian economy , mirrored as he saw with american gulf presence and israel . 
  sykes picot was n't america 's fault . 
  the soviet invasion served goals required by soviets . 
  the us has other , easier routes to their version of necessities . 
  many already pursued . 
  unless you think the usa of today , with bases all over since desert storm has the same needs as the ussr . 
  they 're the second greatest force globally . 
  and are expanding their capabilities rapidly . 
  europe has no naval force projection ( including carriers ) even remotely reaching what they 'll have in their next plan . 
  it 's a problem not because of current strength alone , but the trends being displayed . 
  if/once china dominates the south china sea , it 's all over . 
  the mujahideen were afghans . 
  strict enemies of the taliban . 
  they cared little for wahhabis and their adopted nobility . 
  osama bin laden showed up after the ussr 's force was broken and brought recruits from north africa and trouble makers from the mideast . 
  america abandoning their allies allowed the pakistan and arab supported taliban to win . 
  ** ps . - ** look up the northern alliance and ahmad shah massoud . 
   yet he will throw us to the dogs , to the very country that screwed afghanistan up in the first place in yet another stupid landgrab attempt . 
  afghanistan was a landgrab ? 
  not sure you realise that it has near no worth , mining is impossible with terrorism , populace 's illiterate , landlocked with terrible terrain and poppy is just about the only crop that fares well . 
  geert wilders is also a fan . 
  interesting times ahead . 
  i do n't know why you 'd doubt it . 
  he loves jared and both are super pro-israel . 
   the us is our enemy . 
  the us is the enemy for getting tired defending nations which refuse to contribute to their own defence ? 
  wait till you see how china is demolishing the eu currently while its , like the us and uk , tackling internal hurdles . 
   it 's time to build a political europe . 
  the united states of europe i 'm not sure you realise , but that 's kinda part of what is opposed - because it was done less-than-overtly . 
  anyone can tell you that a monetary union without a fiscal and political union rests either on : * the people `` caving '' in event of a crisis ; or * no crisis ever occurring there 's no way the extremely intelligent and educated individuals who crafted the eu believed the latter . 
  it must then , by elimination , be a cynical roundabout attempt using the former . 
  whether this has soured the goodwill i ca n't say . 
  just throwing out there what is well known but seldom discussed . 
   exactly why people who whine about defense spending are morons . 
  we 've got the numbers on our side , you 're comparing european spending to chinese , without even accounting for purchasing power . 
  i 'm amazed you 'd make that oversight and then remain so assured . 
  ty for making a detailed case for what i was trying to imply . 
  if lacking gun laws * were * the problem vermont would n't be the peaceful place it is . 
  by banning guns you are disarming law abiding citizens while strengthening enemies of society . 
  that 's why schools and theatres are easy targets and why a handful of lowlifes killed 100 in paris . 
  deep south 's going to get another hit with the automation wave coming in . 
  a flawed education system and focus on college `` athletics '' over pyre education and job prospects does n't help . 
  it 's an economic and cultural issue . 
   the issue with guns is that it 's much easier to murder with them so when are we banning trucks , fertilisers and pressure cookers ? 
  people kill because they want to and are in a position to follow through . 
  have you seen chicago and baltimore ? 
  gun laws are lax there compared to tx ? 
  have you tried getting a ccw permit in la ? 
  is la safer than vermont ? 
  vt is safer than il . 
  it 's not gun laws but certain culturally different places . 
  baltimore , chicago , etc take a toll . 
   the upholding of global standards on resolving international issues despite ** immediate ** national interest it 's not immediate when you know it wo n't be reliably reciprocated . 
   massive improvement to the standard of living and life opportunities for hundreds of thousands of people . 
  not your citizens ; not your problem . 
   you 're not even allowed to have a positive opinion about the empire because then you get accused of being a racist imperialist . 
  btw , i get away with it , sorta , cause i 'm of indian origin . 
  also respect churchill , so there is that :p ** ps . - ** agree with you on a united mideast being a threat to freedom . 
  all the way back to the greco-persian wars coming close to ending freedom . 
   your shitty island 2 words : m a g n a _ c a r t a * constitutional monarchy * religious tolerance * representation long before france got guillotining people for crimes of being born in the wrong family * right to trial * colonies which progressed by leaps and bounds under british rule * ending slavery and using the royal navy to hunt down and stop slavers oh , and the language you speak . 
   what do you mean , protection of minorities ? 
  having a different political opinionf rom the government does n't meake you a `` minority '' worthy of special protection it 's a shame you give more credence to differing skin colours and sexual orientation than the values and beliefs people hold . 
   i said that elected representatives of the people make decisions after weighing their associated risks and opportunities against each other and in line with their political positions . 
  by that logic any decision the elected make is beyond reproach . 
   in a democracy you should accept that such decisions may not be to your liking whatever happened to protection of minorities ? 
   the brits purposefully put different religious/ethnic groups together so these countries would stay destabilized and have little to no unity . 
  sykes-picot was a bad deal made a century ago . 
  it makes more sense to blame the french for the holocaust cause of versailles , with rhineland , resources and reparations , than it does to blame the brits for what has one the whole been a very positive spread of good government through the whole world . 
   ** different religious/ethnic groups **  ** have little to no unity ** if these people are so barbaric as to need ethno-nationalism and monolithic religious totalitarianism , with no respect whatsoever for freedom of religion or multiculturalism , maybe it 's on their cumulative society and not brits .
