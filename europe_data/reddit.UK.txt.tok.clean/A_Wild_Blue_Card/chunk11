  ** it 's very hypocritical to blame brits for not creating nations based on ethnic ( racial ) solidarity and purity , or religious tests , to then thrust forth modern `` multiculturalism '' as an ideal and then say all people are equal . 
  either you must , with your premise , abandon the notion of multicultural europe , or believe that european people are superior . 
  which is it ? 
  please tell me how that is n't what you have said when you say citizens `` will have to deal with '' crimes and that they will have to bear the burden of decisions they may not appreciate ? 
   they 'll have to deal with [ crime , including murder ] because we live in a democracy and things dont always go like you want . 
  so , your response to / u/emily _ waves is `` people in democracies have to suffer and have to just live with it because things do n't go your way . '', 
  i thought the whole point of a democracy was that the government could n't thrust upon the people that which they do not desire ; that people are privy to the joy of self-determination and collective free will , that boundless source of course correction coming from the very roots of a nation . 
  yet , here you are , saying that democracy means citizens just have to take any crime and abuse the government hurls on the working people who do n't have private security and rely on public facilities . 
  it may not be as controversial to `` ban '' it on the surface , but how would it be enforced ? 
  all it takes is one questionable incident or scandalous photo and it 's terminal for a politician . 
  some laws may make sense , but the implementation is a political landmine , fraught with too much danger for a veteran to spontaneously brave . 
   with certainty i have none . 
  just pondering . 
  postulating at best . 
   profess a religious creed interesting . 
  but does that preclude any concerns for safety of others , which is a right ? 
  if an argument can be made for a security camera in a public space , which is a soft invasion of privacy , can not a similar one be used to supersede a desire to profess faith by concealing identity ? 
  `` strict '' has to do with following through with the law , right ? 
  what / u/low _ discrepancy said is an approach which does n't , apparently , violate the constitution . 
  would that still be difficult ? 
   you act like we can just say no and it would all go away . 
  i 've heard there 's something called a border which demarcates the boundaries of a nation . 
  the nation being a sovereign territory which foreigners of questionable background and motivation ca n't invade en masse . 
   lol , far right wingers are such a joke who ? 
  i 'm not a right winger . 
  if you think i 'm far right , you may yourself be a political extremist . 
   soooo ... let 's see , bombs start to drop on your country tomorrow , you manage to flee with a few thousends to main europe , your logic than -  bye there are criminals under you , go back and die  bombs are n't likely to fall on my country cause i am not part of a culture which goes to extremism or dictatorship on a constant basis . 
  ** any refugee or immigration must always first serve the host nation 's interests ; the government is responsible to its citizens above all . 
  **  or peopel suddenly start to hate you because of your race or your religion , same play again ... go back you criminal you 're arguing that `` innocent refugees may suffer because of terrible terrorists in their midst . '', 
  why is their welfare more important than the lives of your innocent citizens , of which you have lost several ? 
   hate you because of your race or your religion , same play again ** insurance companies do something called risk assessment . 
  ** ** it 's how they know who to gamble with ** - aka provide insurance , and for how much . 
  ** we create a profile based on age , gender , career , etc. 
  ** ** i see no reason we should n't profile based on beliefs - ideology and religion . 
  **  asyl rights are not ` no gain ' , they were made a reality for a reason . 
  to protect human lives . 
  only if you think they 'll be reciprocated equally . 
  in which case , enjoy meeting santa . 
   because it was n't done for no gain , or no reason please show which great gains were made . 
   nope , and so does n't she . 
  yet you say it was the `` right choice . '', 
  frame the burka as something which prevents government espionage and 24/7 surveillance . 
  parliament will be done with it in a week . 
   why is she giving this obvious election statement ? 
  she is in power right now , go do something about it already . 
  much easier to say something and get credit , while also not drawing the heated response implementing it brings . 
  she gets to take the wind outta her opposition 's sails , deflate the do-or-die attitude some may have , and decide later if she even remembers to follow through on this possibly controversial idea . 
  and italy has it well within its power to legally sink any ship forcefully ferrying foreign invaders , from libyan waters , into its ports . 
  what , do you think saudi arabia ( syria/yemen ) or china ( north korea ) dares to set a precedent that that is n't the case ? 
  only europeans will even consider so -- and that 's because this is intra-eu politics . 
  african nations and south americans can be easily corralled into sane arguments , by applying the right economic pressures . 
   it 's pretty clear that a big part of eu population does n't want immigrants , so stop alienating voters or more radical leaders will be elected . 
  if you want the eu or a particular party so badly that you will vote for them despite their utter contempt for your wishes , what incentive do they have to not treat you like shit ? 
   italy has summoned the austrian ambassador over this . 
  also the european commission said ngos must be accepted and have a right to operate . 
  and to complete the picture for today spain and france said they wo n't open their ports for their ships partecipating in operation sophia . 
   if such nonsense is the will of the eu , then eu skeptics have a valid point . 
  exactly what happened to enforcing the most basic immigration laws in the us once hispanics became a significant demographic : ethnic/religious allegiance supersedes national loyalty and laws will be ignored to placate this belligerent minority . 
  in other words , the nation is dead ; only tribal affiliation remains . 
  wonder why . 
   in 1998 , soros , whose aggressive currency trades were blamed for destroying the thai and malaysian economies in the asian financial crisis a year earlier , turned his attention to attacking hong kong markets . 
  on that occasion , hong kong , backed by beijing , faced him with an unprecedented hk$ 118 billion stock-buying spree to prop up stock prices and defend the currency peg in august 1998 . 
   `` many are worried that soros could attack china , the yuan and the hong kong dollar as he did to ... the baht , but i do n't think he still has that power . ''  the people 's bank of china controls the onshore yuan market and carries huge influence in the offshore yuan market in hong kong , making it hard for soros to develop shorting strategies against the currency , he added . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/1906325/how-beijing-and-hong-kong-sent-billionaire-george-soros-packing ) or , you know : [ here 's how george soros broke the bank of thailand ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/how-george-soros-broke-the-bank-of-thailand-2016-9 ) [ 1997 asian financial crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_asian_financial_crisis ) not shady enough ? 
  it gets better :  dr. mahathir has reserved his most trenchant comments for global currency traders , particularly george soros , an american currency hedge-fund operator and philanthropist . 
  even before their invited speeches at the world bank-imf annual meetings in ** hong kong in september 1997 , dr. mahathir derided mr. soros and other currency speculators as wealthy people who use their money to force developing countries `` to submit to the dictatorship of international manipulators . 
  '' ** mahathir expressed his own country 's interest in a more international economy but one with protection `` from self-serving rogues and international brigandage . '', 
   ** george soros , whose open society foundation funds anti-slorc burma activist groups in the u.s. and other countries , was one of the most vocal opponents of the country 's admission into asean . 
  ** perhaps unsurprisingly , conspiracy theorists claimed that soros ' actions in the currency market led to the collapse of the thai baht on july 2 and the subsequent fall of other asean countries ' currencies . 
  this was likened to a similar speculative attack soros led on the british pound sterling in september 1992 .

'' [ macedonia to george soros and usaid : go away ] ( https://spectator.org/macedonia-to-george-soros-and-usaid-go-away/ ) i 'd really like to know when the rich controlling politicians and causing global chaos and strife is acceptable for / r/europe . 
  because for some reason soros acting in a manner akin to war-profiteers , which he also is , is never met with the condemnations the transgression apparently warrants .

  ** details and voter background/occupation/income breakup , please ? 
  trying to understand how locals are voting and prioritising , genuinely and without memes . 
  you clearly never read . 
  so i 'm just going to ask if you are old enough to remember us aircraft carriers and the kosovo/serbia/yugoslavia mess . 
  not uk soil . 
  all of those fucking require the uk to have complete permission to use their soil , infrastructure , and military equipment to conduct even a single sortie . 
  if you do n't understand the magnitude of that diplomatic and strategic hurdle , i ca n't help you . 
  in a wartime scenario , placing even that one carrier in the baltic could prove decisive . 
  if you think a military does n't pay dividends , when used correctly , you have n't been paying attention . 
  north korea and afghanistan are both inordinately important from a mining and strategic perspective . 
  controlling all the world 's food delivery , via oil price control , is another money maker . 
  not to mention that it paved the way for technology needed for energy based weapons : think anti-missile laser research and the hypersonic projectile systems . 
   was n't the whole debate about nuclear versus diesel ultimately due to cost and everything else was secondary ? 
  it 's about having a permanent , mobile airfield which you can deploy to within 12 nautical miles of most any enemy . 
  unlawful combatants , working for terrorist organisations , not on us soil have no legal protections . 
  anything else is wishful revisionist interpretation . 
   nobody is calling some law a human right except you predicated your causal on a recognition of a human right for murderers to live . 
  the user you responded to , / u/bystandershaolin , never said `` human rights . '', 
  you read into his statements that phrase , and applied it to certain hypothetical actions . 
   prohibition of torture , right to a fair trial , including being presumed innocent until proven guilty , no punishment without law . 
  all apply to those not found guilty . 
  i have never once said those under trial should n't have basic rights .
