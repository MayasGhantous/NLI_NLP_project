  my comment specifically specified application to those ** convicted . 
   would n't people just argue that some human rights are inalienable and therefore can not , even in the case of serious crime , be revoked ? 
   which ones ? 
  do osama bin laden and breivik deserve life , if the only way to capture them 'd involve use of fatal force ? 
  * ( 1 ) is it justice to let either live in a comfortable , even if confined , environment , till the end of the days , with taxpayers footing their food/healthcare bills ? 
  * ( 1 ) would you force taxpayers to take care of a violent criminal interested in their deaths , or force said criminal to work as a slave forever ? 
  do gag orders not exist ? 
  how is silencing a person not infringing upon an inalienable freedom ? 
  this list could really go on . . 
  personally , i 'm a strict believer in natural rights and only those . 
  it 's the only system truly internally consistent : where the government only protects those liberties and rights you have ** in absence ** of crime , wrongdoing or oppression directed at or against you . 
  but to argue that even those ca n't be denied for punishment -- especially after someone has been found guilty of violating those of others -- is asinine . 
  leaving be the obvious question of incentives and disincentives so created , you 're precluding the application of virtually any penalty . 
   the right to life is generally thought inalienable and as such it is wrong to kill convicted criminals through a death sentence etc. 
  i 've always held that all rights belong to citizens and invited foreigners in absence of their breaking the law . 
  to kill an enemy , however , is natural . 
   how do you make the distinction between which human rights are allowed to be revoked and through which circumstances ? 
  seems like a normative nightmare . 
  it is . 
  and why i do n't care to entangle it further than the bare minimum : ensuring there is n't an incentive for the state to use prosecution as a political or dictatorial tool . 
  ** edit - ** [ anders behring breivik : death penalty or acquittal only logical outcomes for me ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/9211850/anders-behring-breivik-death-penalty-or-acquittal-only-logical-outcomes-for-me.html )  `` i do n't wish for it but i would have respected that decision , '' he said . 
  `` there are only two outcomes in this case that i had respected , that that is the death penalty or acquittal . '', 
  calling a law a human rights law/act/ordinance does n't make it an unimpeachable authority or canon source of the same . 
  south africa or saudi arabia may write their own * human rights act 2017 * , but whatever is in it may not qualify as gospel truth on all matters moral . 
  humans are awarded rights , including those to life , liberty , and property . 
  however , no one would deny that humans have fundamental rights to liberty ( free movement or political participation ) revoked for ** conviction of a serious crime . 
  ** the fault lies not in the existence of human rights , but in the faulty legislation protecting those who have ( quite possibly violently ) threatened , harmed and wronged society and are being penalised for being found guilty on those very grounds . 
  ** note : ** i 'd say humans are guaranteed rights which are protected , but i think `` awarded '' is much more appropriate given that no nation here using the natural rights doctrine . 
  the half in which europe lead the world ? 
  / u/oonnyx might have a point . 
  it 's one of the reasons that putin is , oddly , good for russia . 
  look up the 2006 democrat wave and arab spring wikileaks and cables . 
   only an idiot would n't know that these people are legally seen as refugees no matter if you believe it or not , why do you deny basic facts ? 
  do you hate science ? 
   these refugees will have their limitations within your society and they will be returned to their countries when they are deemed safe 1 . 
  how many are refugees ? 
  not even you believe they 'll all be returned . 
  hell , you could even argue the mideast/africa will never be `` safe . '', 
   what is social dumping ? 
  we earn less and have weaker workers privilages because our economy is weaker and poorer . 
  low wages is our only advantage on common market . 
  otherwise all our companies would go bancrupt . 
  whole we had over 50 years to build theirs companies and capital . 
  we are only on begin of this road . 
   yeah , this is basic economics . 
  of course , protectionist policies such as those espoused and enabled by france require ignorance or belligerence to survive in such an environment . 
   after 1989 a lot has been done to completely destroy polish heavy industry , agriculture , media , retail and banking sectors . 
  just go there and you 'll see - banks , shops and companies from all over the western europe , but just a few local ones ( if any ) . 
  the way middle/east european structural development is funded today with eu funds is also very tricky , as it 's in fact only partial and requires that the country/city/region pays the rest and they usually take credits to pay their part and the credit is usually taken in one of the western banks ( mostly german if i 'm not wrong ) , so after all financial help of eu ends in growing debt . 
  sounds like colonial mercantilism . 
  fair point . 
  i agree greatly , but specified france because of this thread and the general willful ignorance embraced by the french w.r.t their own misdeeds -- past and present . 
  anglos tend to own up , while the french are quick to sidestep all blame . 
   newly formed nice agitprop . 
  communist takeovers and genocides deserve no cushioning . 
  searching for a shred of concern for communists ... ... ... ... . 
   what does all this have to do with france ? 
  read up on the french demands and greed for `` reparations '' post-ww1 . 
   khilafat movement did n't cause hindu-muslim animosity . 
  never argued that . 
  only that it exacerbated the situation and guaranteed the partition . 
  the first major ideological fallout between gandhi and jinnah happened when gandhi chose to suspend protests , having partially sated himself , while jinnah felt it was a betrayal of the primary cause for many muslims . 
  this being an unprecedented attempt at hindu-muslim cooperation , it created a divide which is often understated in favor of the later political disagreements . 
   * the ali brothers criticised gandhi 's extreme commitment to non-violence and severed their ties with them after he suspended all non-cooperation movement after the killing of 22 policemen at chauri chaura in 1922 . 
  due to this gandhiji became disturbed and very sad and called off the movement as he always believed in non-violence . 
  * however , it is also true that the immediate reason for the disposal of the committee was the much criticised embezzlement of 1.6 million rupees . 
  [ citation needed ] the ali brothers were severely criticised by muslim politicians and the public . 
  although holding talks with the british and continuing their activities , the khilafat struggle weakened as muslims were divided between working for the congress , the khilafat cause and the muslim league . 
  after hindu-muslim riots of 1926 -- 1927 many muslim leaders like mohammad akram khan lost interest in the movement . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khilafat_movement the unifying cause failing , jinnah felt it a vindication of his suspicion that muslims would be `` second class '' and their interests relegated in a united india . 
  to / u/nigerianprince421 's point , i understand perfectly well which country was occupying the majority of india . 
  just as i understand that international developments impacted its history , similar to how indian colonial interests impacted the history of the cape of good hope . 
  source : read into this topic when i was younger , and familial records from individuals who survived the jalianwala bagh massacre , and were majorly involved in the politics of the region from then to at least the partition . 
   first of all , sykes-picot did n't determine any borders , it was about spheres of influence . 
  and radiation does n't kill people , it just has an influence at a cellular or lower level . 
   the rise of jihadism can be directly linked to the al-saud family that was supported by the british . 
  only possible because of the vacuum created after the caliph was removed . 
   saying that france fucked up without giving any context for each action or the world order at that time is dumb . 
  remarkable how they randomly managed to ( somewhat ) further short-term national interests while screwing up global stability and millions of lives . 
  in each instance . 
  that 's a teeny bit different from a `` only hindsight is 20/20 '' case . 
   agreed france should n't have fought against vietnamese , laotian and cambodian independence or colonised it in the first place , but it 's not responsible for the us intervention which was entirely an american decision . 
  the conditions and groundwork for communism and radical revolutionaries were created by french colonialist excesses . 
  the usa did n't intervene fully in cambodia , and we know what happened there . 
  hint : pol pot , mass murders/genocide claiming 2-3 million lives . 
  2004 saw a massive democrat anti-war wave which destroyed any such plans . 
  hence the postponement till well into obama 's first term , when the arab spring was orchestrated . 
  * isis * al nusra * wahhabis * euphrates shield * genocidal insurgents * israeli sponsored terrorists controlling the golan oh , and us/nato interests denying syria 's connection to northern iraq/iran , and the naval facilities tied to putin . 
   the only people in the us who enjoy the aipac-led interventionism are those who meet up at bill kristol 's wine cellar every friday . 
   top kek . 
  oddly accurate , minus the clintonistas who are carted in in their coffins . 
   the problem is that those same people make up 99 % of dc 's population so even if you campaign on non-interventionism which is why i believe the us is a failed democracy . 
  when the media higher ups manipulate information and work with permanent , entrenched power brokers to force us taxpayer dollars and the lives of us kids to be expended overseas , in wars the nation 's populace does not want , it can hardly be called a democracy . 
  congress did n't approve of the syria strike . 
  congress does n't care to do their constitutional duty . 
  they 'd rather shrug it off and have the economy collapse while interventionism benefitting the 0.1 % and insider trading aficionados is encouraged . 
   they 've held the monopoly on `` security & defense experts '' for the last 40 years . 
  case in point : brookings institute and qatar . 
  qatar has financed and housed `` think-tanks '' they pay most generously , and now has their henchmen writing bs defending the dynasty behind al jazeera -- that same reprehensible bag of crap which broadcasted al qaeda propaganda . 
  similar groups , including aipac , have completely demolished any war-by-consent ideals the founders laid out .
