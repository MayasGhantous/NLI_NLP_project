  eisenhower , kennedy , and , oddly , nixon were the last to have shown any concern for the * demos * . 
  obama got his first term co-opted by hrc , who went to work delighting the warmonger class . 
  trump got `` russia '' spammed so much he 's now almost engaged in a proxy war as he attempts to appear legitimate to the sort of corrupt idiot who cares for this nonsense . 
  it 's goddamn infuriating . 
   also : a lot of syrians are islamists themselves . 
  so some would actually want such shit . 
  just as they supported is . 
  hence my support for assad . 
  one of the reasons , anyway . 
  lead the fuck up . 
  then called in the us when it could n't sustain a bombing campaign against goddamn libya . 
  such nato power . 
  who does n't love half-assed interventionism . 
  ** oh , and france has lead fuckups the world over : ** * anglo-french unsustainable lending to egypt followed by the takeover of the insolvent egyptian economy , including raf bombers over egypt , radicalised a generation and created the egyptian nationalist and muslim brotherhood ideologies * sykes-picot is the reason the mideast is the tinderbox we know it to be * removal of the ottoman caliphate and humiliation of the same after ww1 lead to the rise of mecca ( wahhabi saudis ) and faux islamist leadership ( include the isis caliphate ) the world over * the above precipitated in the exaggeration of hindu/muslim conflict in india , and assured jinnah that the partition was necessary * vietnam was a westwar looking nation taking cues from both the united states and japan as it faced a brutal , racist french colonial exploitation ; coups and monarchic meddling lead to the battle of dien bien phu and french exit culminating in the us 's vietnam war * the suez crisis was lead by anglo-french ( financial ) desires to takeover the suez , using israel to remove egyptian control , and ended when eisenhower threatened both parties * bill clinton 's famous ( lack of ) intervention in the dr congo/uganda crisis was foreshadowed by french mining interests in the region involved in regime change and oppressive neo-colonialism french whitewashing aside , they have one of the most interventionist and bloody legacies in the modern world . 
  ** ps - ** ignoring versailles/ww2 here . 
  it actually lines up near perfectly with key leaders in the us promising to invade or replace regimes in iraq , iran , sudan , libya , syria , etc in bush 's first term , and the interventionism lead by anglo-french forces in the mena . 
  the only part somewhat inaccurate is that they gloss over french responsibility . 
  [ general wesley clark : wars were planned - seven countries in five years ] ( https://youtu.be/9rc1mepk_sw )  we 're going to war with iraq , 20 sept 2001 . 
   syria , lebanon , libya , somalia , sudan and , finishing off , iran . 
   euphrates shield pretty much all islamists . 
  good . 
  now we have the perfect bargaining chip to keep erdogan in line . 
  he 's been getting away with too much . 
  it 's always nice to have the means to screw over belligerent asshats without invading them . 
  yeah , except for the part where both trump and obama ( 2nd term ) were getting support because they spoke out against stupid interventionism . 
   and why exactly are eastern europeans offended by being labeled racist , when ( your own words ) you aim to keep your country `` racially homogenous '' ? 
  / u/ilikewaffles95 wants racial homogeneity . 
  not supremacy , or even discriminatory laws , but uniformity . 
  multiple research studies have concluded that multi-ethnic societies are prone to fractures and tribal conflicts , with tribal spats superseding normal policy based politics . 
  multi-ethnic societies vote increasingly along demographic lines ; have less faith in government and common institutions ; see increased `` i got mine '' behaviours and corruption ; witness citizens trusting less those who look differently , and even those who look similar . 
  this is ignoring fractious foreign policy conflicts and internal strifes serving enemies of the nation . 
  such has been the case , time and again , in a multitude of multi-ethnic experiments lacking extreme cultural solidarity and nationalistic allegiance .

   this also has a lot to do with xenophobia . 
   if you 're going to accuse a generous native people of xenophobia , you better back it up or stfu . 
  otherwise you 're just victim-blaming to deflect from the misdeeds of , and deny the individual agency of , migrants . 
  always call them out on victim blaming without evidence , / u/clnyze19n . 
  shh ... we 're racists . 
  we do n't want to point out we were right , or we 'll also become nazis . 
  wait till the refugees reproduce like mad , and are still much less productive . 
  their taxation/capita will be so low you will need an even larger influx of immigrants to sustain the welfare state , or dismantle it even for natives . 
  it 's a goddamn pyramid scheme , with a side of inferior construction materials . 
   in all media here how 's it being covered , and how much ? 
  sorry , i 'm trying to understand the reaction from both the press and the people but have never been to your country . 
  the `` eu army '' sounds so much more attractive now . . 
  as the capital of the eu , brussels should lead the way . 
   immagine how much terrorists were arrested and how many terrorist attacks were reversed only because we paid for it from our taxes . 
  still waiting for someone to say how this saves the welfare state from collapsing due to an aging population . 
    homogenous nations  how far would you have to go back for ira/ulster bombings not to be able to occur ? 
  you see , a sensible person would tell you that the ira mess was because ireland/uk was n't a homogenous nation . 
  which kinda was / u/angelinoheights 's point . 
  everything suggests they will try to go out with a bombing spree even larger than what we 've seen so far . 
  if they have half a brain , it wo n't be hard -- rudimentary chemical agents and explosives can be made by any fucktard with a school diploma . 
   ar-raqqah , the isis 's capital , and mosul , isis 's largest city , are both weeks from falling into hands of our allies . 
  you think the fall of the isis `` caliphate '' will end the war ? 
  was the cold war about territory alone , or did ideology play a part ? 
  * selective transparency , apparently, 
   i think the reelection of rouhani shows that the majority of iranians want to be more western and democratic you 're beyond the pale . 
  what ? 
  do you understand how the government of iran works ? 
   almost any adult of iranian origin and with iranian nationality can take his or her identity card , a few passport-sized photos and the necessary documents to the interior ministry in tehran 's fatemi street to register as a candidate . 
  but not everyone is allowed to take part . 
  the guardian council , a powerful body of six clergymen and six jurists , vets each candidacy . 
  political competence and loyalty to the fundamental principles of the islamic republic and its religion are among the main issues considered by the council . 
   https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/16/iran-presidential-elections-everything-you-need-to-know  after registrations are complete , the guardian council ( one of the real stations of power in iran ) `` reviews '' the entrants and decides in its sole authority whom is to be permitted to run , and whom denied . 
  the council does not publicly discuss its reasons for barring candidates , but effectively anyone of insufficient religious orthodoxy , anyone who is viewed as politically threatening or radical by the ruling theocracy , or -- without exception -- anyone who is female , is not allowed to stand for election . 
   https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/05/12/irans-farce-presidential-election/#10df0f3e3375 i hope you are duly compensated for such magnificent ignorance . 
  it would be a shame if someone was genuinely so misinformed , and outright daft . 
  keep spreading propaganda . 
   except iran has a democratically elected government partially , so did nazi germany . 
  yes , i know that . 
  and that 's exactly why i do n't want any khabar.ir site 's bs on jcpoa compliance any more than i want john mccain 's perspective . 
  jcpoa is a joke and nothing similar could even be attempted once the country has already secured nuclear weapons up to , at least , boosted fission devices . 
  not with a chinese ally/satellite state in pakistan , nor with an economy likely to surpass uk/france , in india . 
  both are extremely similar in certain respects , and have similarly criticized agreements which front-load benefits while providing limited , subpar means to validate compliance -- which is most definitely not in their national interest . 
  the fucking hellhole which was laundering and shipping chinese nuclear technology to north korea , this time last year ? 
  the nation of aq khan , nuclear proliferator extraordinaire ? 
  khan offered nuclear weapons technology to saddam fucking hussein , who turned it down because he thought it was a cia sting operation . 
  that is the pakistani track record on nuclear responsibility . 
  yes , cause the comparable deal offered to north korea ended so well . 
   khabar online definitely not pushing an agenda there , op . 
  assuming your analogy includes a provision for the bit where you funded and fed the restaurant . 
  germany ca n't spend 2 % gdp on the military for nato in 2017 , but is supposed to become a military superpower , unilaterally , with the same < 2 % ? 
  really hoping that the united states capitalises on it , and attempts to mass import highly educated europeans . 
  those open to american freedom , of course . 
  home getting chopped is perfectly fine with current events . 
  fptp has a ton of advantages , but that 's not something worth even voicing here . 
  this is possibly one of the most important articles , long term . 
  shame it 's buried . 
  otoh , monetary policy is n't the most exciting topic to discuss or meme . 
  not just muslims , but pagans too , iirc . 
  good . 
  if you jump to draconian internet censorship before restricting immigration and crackdowns on those known to be extremists , you deserve to lose . 
  not to mention how the more conventional issues `` campaign '' was run . 
  does anyone pity may getting the possible boot ? 
  she 's a political mouthpiece with little consistent ideology other than opposition to liberty .
