  now for the nuclear program : [ pakistani scientist [ aq ] khan describes iranian efforts to buy nuclear bombs ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/13/ar2010031302258.html )  the father of pakistan 's nuclear weapons program has written an official account that details an iranian attempt to buy atomic bombs from pakistan at the end of the 1980s . 
   bomb-maker abdul qadeer khan states in documents obtained by the washington post that in lieu of weapons , pakistan gave iran bomb-related drawings , parts for centrifuges to purify uranium and a secret worldwide list of suppliers . 
  iran 's centrifuges , which are viewed as building blocks for a nuclear arsenal , are largely based on models and designs obtained from pakistan . 
   but pakistan 's former top military official in 2006 publicly hinted at it .

  khan boasts of helping iran 's nuclear programme ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/6170145/a.q.-khan-boasts-of-helping-irans-nuclear-programme.html )  khan , who is regarded as a hero by many in pakistan , said he had set tehran on the road to achieving its nuclear ambitions by guiding its scientists to his own network of suppliers based in dubai . 
  he said his network of scientists had supplied not only pakistan , ** but also libya and iran with key compenents to make specialised centrifuges for enriching uranium . 
  **  mr khan was dismissed from his job as chairman of kahuta research laboratories in 2001 and in 2004 confessed to his role in nuclear proliferation , stating that he had acted on his own and without the authority of his government . 
   ** although he did not admit aiding north korea or libya , both of which use centrifuges similar to his original designs , he said libya 's nuclear programme had been supplied by the same companies which had supplied pakistan and iran .

  **  prince mohammed bin nawwaf bin abdulaziz al-saud , saudi arabia 's long-serving ambassador to london , says that for many years the kingdom upheld the policy established by the late king fahd that riyadh would not pursue a policy of developing nuclear weapons . 
  `` then it became known that iran was pursuing a policy that could be shifted to a weapons-of-mass-destruction programme , '' prince mohammed explained in an exclusive interview with the daily telegraph . 
  `` this has changed the whole outlook in the region . '' oh , and if anyone wants to know if saudis are a valuable military ally , from the same article :  in the past two years , ** it has beaten britain into fourth place in the world 's military spending ** league with a defence budget of around # 37 billion ( compared with the uk at around # 34 billion ) . 
  ** the military offensive in yemen has seen saudi arabia deploy an estimated 150,000 troops -- nearly twice the size of the british army ** -- while saudi fighter jets , many of them british-made , have flown thousands of sorties . 
   realpolitik view would be that the us should be allied with iran instead of saudi arabia .

  wonder why . 
   oh yeah excellent results for the russians , 3000 + civilian death since 2000 because of terror attacks . 
  considering what well could have been , that 's a tiny fraction . 
  chechens had outside help , weapons , structure , and operated with all the post-ussr organised crime networks already established .

   iraq bush 's foreign policy was shit . 
  capturing and torturing terrorists is n't foreign policy ; it 's pest control with a side of standard information extraction . 
   this is a pattern one sees : russia , india , china , and israel all believe in collective punishment as a deterrent . 
  why ? 
  ** the logic is because terrorists are prepared to die , so the only way to make them pause is with massive blowback . 
  ** ** you think a life sentence is going to deter a suicide bomber ?

  yes , i 'm above those `` humans '' whose conduct voids any claim to consideration as such . 
  oh , that 's simple . 
  it 's because the outrage is over personality and rhetoric instead of policy , despite what eu nationalists feel of their supposedly superior erudition . 
   likely to be shot in the usa almost all shootings involve gang or cartel affiliates , especially in less desirable locations with criminally inclined populations .
