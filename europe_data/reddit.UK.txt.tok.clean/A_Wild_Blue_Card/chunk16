  statistically , it 's the children of migrants who will go aloha snackbar . 
   whereas the us lets people walk into schools with automatic weapons . 
  wtf ? 
  do you think automatic weapons are n't regulated ? 
  you sound delusional . 
  do me a favor , and look at the rate of gun violence in vermont and in chicago . 
  guess which almost does n't need permits , and which is regularly in front of the scotus defending anti-2a practices . 
  ** [ what you sound like . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/theswogblog/status/867505935694123008 ) **, 
  if you 'd ever read genesis , you 'd know god promised to never do that again . 
  atheist derision of religious nuts is cool , and often fun , but at least try to not make yourself sound like a pompous chap citing a book he has n't read . 
  a military costing less than the current 2 % , and a fraction of the current influence ? 
  russia wo n't go to war over a jet violating sovereign airspace . 
  it was a provocation , and putin knew the risks . 
  marking of territory , smoke spiel about a brave martyr , sovereignty blabla , all resolved . 
  war does n't favor putin 's key advantages . 
  greece may be interested in some live fire accidents , within greek airspace . 
  close , but not dangerous . 
  erdogan wo n't have much he could then do , without being forced to putin -- and putin will then give him the bare minimum . 
  aka , make it a loss to escalate . 
  rising at a joke of a pace . 
  france started that conflict with libya , and then bailed out . 
  each individual nation having a functional defence does n't contribute to collective defence ? 
  the `` guidelines '' are arbitrary in that they were agreed upon . 
  us military presence in germany is impossible if germany does n't desire it . 
  and if germany does , they could 've negotiated it . 
  just as the us does with gulf states . 
  geopolitical implications impacting germany , too . 
  if those are serious enough , it 's time to pay up . 
  for the nation which has gained perhaps the most , combined , from nato and the eurozone , this is n't an unreasonable ask . 
  and if turkey tried to cancel a nato summit in berlin , i 'd object to that too . 
  `` aim to move towards '' is n't exactly happening when countries have surpluses they divert elsewhere . 
  either you carry out a commitment in good faith , or have the decency to publicly call for its removal -- because you genuinely feel it worthless . 
  thanks , i wish nato would quit with this meaningless moral bs . 
  i think nations not meeting their targets should n't get to weaken a common body , least not without veto power going to those committed to the safety of their citizens . 
  is that not fair ? 
  you seem to wish to argue strict legality to take advantage of allies . 
  i 'm demonstrating how unhealthy that idea is , and that it cuts both ways . 
  your haphazard haste to tick off erdogan will only grant him domestic legitimacy . 
  it 's purely domestic political pandering by a group of `` leaders '' who are n't committed to defence . 
  ** you want to separate erdogan from his base ? 
  go to turkey and call him out , there and then , in front of his populace . 
  ** do so while embracing the people , and you 'll have a slim ( but infinitely better ) chance of striking back against that nut . 
  and article 5 does n't mandate the allies help with the full force of their militaries ; a single nominal harrier could legally suffice . 
  turkey is vital ; erdogan ephemeral . 
  to spite him in this manner , by not going to turkey only makes him a more permanent annoyance . 
   unless there is some sort of nato exercise or combat group building where germany or france or the netherlands is n't capable of contributing the required military gear , like libya ? 
  where france could n't bomb gaddafi without running out of supplies ? 
   waste money if the money is wasted , feel free to abandon the collective defence . 
   are you done crawling up the sultans ass ? 
  you done playing politics at the cost of strategic territory ? 
   then please stop ** spreading the rumor ** that european countries do not contribute enough to nato , there is ** no applicable metric that leads to this conclusion ** [ ** nato secretary general 's official report , page 102 ** ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2017_03/20170313_sg_annualreport_2016_en.pdf ), 
  and if turkey sought to weaken nato by losing us strategic waters , i 'd tell them to buzz off . 
  ** you 've already antagonised putin . 
  probably irreparably . 
  might as well project strength at the cost of an enemy than an ally . 
   good mentality . 
  support a dictator in the alliance because another disctator is on the other side . 
  that 's the mentality of a collective defence . 
  if you want to feel good about your ethics , circlejerk over eu virtue . 
  if you want security , nato exists . 
  i 'm saying that as long as you 're not meeting your obligations , you do n't get to mess up the collective defence , at a key strategic level , over domestic moral posturing . 
  nato was n't created for petty politics , and if it was , contribute . 
  real smart . 
  you lot piss of erdogan , get all jingoistic re : putin , and then pass the buck . 
  yeah , i get that argument . 
  self determination is n't voided because the people elected corrupt scum . 
  not really looking as if there 's a `` good '' option here . 
  countries which are smart enough to know this will both empower and scorn erdogan , while russia , syria , and iran are crucial zones to influence . 
  why are countries which do n't contribute enough to nato being allowed to subvert it further ? 
  nato is a military alliance . 
  pissing off the holders of the bosphorus , especially after crimea , is extremely foolish . 
  what will it accomplish ? 
  erdogan will parlay this into even more domestic power . 
  no , it 's just meaningless posturing by politicians who wish to appear moral and firm domestically -- at the cost of collective security . 
  *********** and if the summit must move , it should be to poland or estonia . 
  right across putin , and in a nation committed to common defense . 
  why ? 
  lol [ yeah , spending 59 % of your net tax income on non-westen immigrants is n't exactly sustainable . 
  ] ( http://www.dailywire.com/news/16816/non-western-immigrants-consume-59-denmarks-tax-joseph-curl ) this goes to / u/dyaknowhwatimeanlike 's point of not solving problems , and sure as hell alienating at least half the united states . 
  in countries with a major `` support our troops '' sentiment , mocking anti-terror initiatives and skimping on joint defense funding -- especially when inviting in mena islamists and terrorism threats ; awarding them billions in welfare -- is n't going to win over allies . 
  not when idiots voted to make saudis head honchos of human rights at the un , so they `` become better feminists . '', 
  your instinct to silence or remove says a lot . 
   the us can be a great destination to live . 
  if you make a lot of money and you 're not a minority . 
  the us is a great place , even as a minority . 
  doubt it 'll last . 
  hopefully it does , but trudeau is terrible . 
  postmodernist cultural marxism . 
  it 's not liberalism . 
   i 'm definitely aware that europe is not easy to get into either as a job-seeker does anyone other than the australians have a sensible , talent based immigration system in the west ? 
  can you identify as mexican ? 
  why do you care , all your people are running to russia . 
   wait , he still does not understand that the us trades with the eu and not the individual member states ? 
   this man is so dumb even after having it explained 11 times to him he still ca n't get it .

  this degree of stupidity is even dumb by george bush levels and we all thought he was the original bottom . 
  the word you 're looking for , proud speaker for the uk , is `` have . '', 
  it 's a verb .
