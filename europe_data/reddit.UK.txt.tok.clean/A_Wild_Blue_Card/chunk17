  unlike * of , * which is not . 
  bush 's foreign policy re : iraq was a conceptual failure . 
  however , if you ever read military strategy , the surge was a success . 
  that 's what happened when he took over . 
  [ read this ; educate yourself . 
  ] ( http://keithhennessey.com/2013/04/24/smarter/ ) and i do n't even like the guy . 
   ( not doing anything to stop ) rwanda ? 
  look into mining in the region . 
  french did much more than not solve the problem . 
   similar with the british government of the time . 
  it is reminiscent of the suez crisis both orchestrated with israel as the spear . 
  what did it cost him ? 
  nothing . 
  it 's true . 
  none sane doubt that . 
  however , if you 're committed to treating russia is the foremost enemy , it 's hardly bold . 
   you guys are the beacon of hope , liberty and enlightnment in europe . 
  libya . 
  guess who lead the way . 
  does putin feel ? 
  he 's killed so many enemies , you got ta wonder if it 's like a magical hole-in-one , or just the assuaging sound a good drive makes . 
   trump calls bullshit a lot , but almost all of it is ** , in fact ** , him talking bullshit . 
  yes , aye , extremely and vocally to the latter . 
  as for the former , i trust the modi government more than the inc , but i would n't say kickbacks and bribes are eliminated . 
  not with sushma swaraj in that office . 
   there would be some projects which would be off-limits when it comes to national security , but foreign firms should be encouraged to bring in their expertise and hasten the infrastructural growth . 
  i 'm sure the bidding process will go perfectly . 
  no kickbacks ; no corruption . 
  if the eu keeps aligning with china , you 're going to see a revived tpp orders of magnitude more potent . 
  india , korea , japan and vietnam will likely have to be dragged along , to align with the anglosphere or risk chinese expansionist policy murdering them . 
  the eu 's pathetic submission to arab and chinese excesses and human rights violations should make abundantly obvious how farcical and pathetic the concern for ethics or basic morality is -- making the america bashing 's roots all the more transparent . 
  if the indian government gives major domestic infrastructure/natural resources procurements to foreigners , it 'll end badly . 
  history says it 's all but guaranteed . 
  it gets worse . 
   trump dresses like a cunt . 
   his ties are long to make up for something and he never buttons his jacket . 
  obama would constantly button/unbutton it depending on if he was sitting or standing like you 're supposed to . 
   trump , always open . 
  then again trump rights in all caps and cant write in cursive . 
  \\  trump rights \\  rights \\  cant write in cursive wow . 
  you 're trying to trash the president of the united states for a supposed inability to write in cursive -- a real flaw , that one -- but wrote `` rights . '', 
  is there a higher plane of faux-intellectualism to which you could even aspire ? 
  hey , estonian dude , just want to say thanks !, 
  love that you guys are matching the 2 % for our ** mutual ** defence . 
  much love . 
   hmm , we 're only a few generations away from the partition of india and pakistan . 
  it 's possible families broken up back then are being reunited in the west by descendents completely unaware . 
  explain ? 
   some punjabis remained hindu some converted ( or were converted ) fuck off with your euphemisms , apologist . 
  there was genocide after genocide , going back centuries . 
   the same ethnicity ( punjab ) you 're assuming people would marry their daughters into islam . 
  same region , significant ethnic differences . 
   the problems with other muslim communities are heavily aggravated by evangelism from that sect . 
  no , the other muslim communities are perfectly capable of many genocides , w/o gulf help . 
   the media should not be loyal to an administration . 
  after the last 8 years ? 
   democracy depends on a free press and the free flow of information . 
  not just information that the potus or a political party wants you to see . 
  funny , i never saw the iran deal published . 
  yet to see how this publication of classified material was in public interest . 
   but i 'm not surprised you 're also pushing this `` deep state coup '' bullshit because you 're also a donald cult member . 
  all just a vast right wing conspiracy . 
  just like libya , the arab spring corruption , jcpoa , fast and furious , irs , the cox report , sandy berger , kosovo and uganda , etc. 
  read the articles linked . 
   because in those conversations it 's trump endangering the national security , not the press . 
  he 's leaked stuff to russia and the philippines already . 
  the potus regularly discussed classified materials with foreign partners , including russia . 
  ** unless you 're the sort of idiot who thinks leaders of nations only use publicly available information when discussing mideast coalitions . 
  philippines being told of 2 submarines ' general whereabouts ? 
  ** that 's publicly available information the pentagon has already released , you godforsaken dolt . 
  [ this political party ? 
  ] ( http://www.dailywire.com/news/986/only-7-journalists-are-republican-aaron-bandler )  * jonathan allen , who has worked as a senior washington correspondent for politico , washington bureau chief for bloomberg and chief political correspondent for vox , used to work for rep. debbie wasserman schultz ( d-fl . ), 
   * andy barr , who used to cover former alaska gov. 
  sarah palin for politico , left to work for the democratic party in arizona . 
   * john harris , politico 's editor-in-chief , is married to ann o'hanlon , who was the director of naral virginia after being a writer for the washington post . 
   * chuck todd , host of nbc 's meet the press , is married to kristian todd , who used to be a communications person for the democratic party and founded maverick strategies and mail , a political consulting firm for liberals . 
  todd himself used to be a staffer for sen. tom harkin ( d-ia . ) . 
   * linda douglass , current global head of communications for bloomberg , was a correspondent for cbs news , abc news , contributing editor of national journal and senior vice president of global communications for the atlantic , and used to be the communications director of president barack obama 's office of health reform , which pushed through obamacare . 
   attempt to undermine the administration and the us/uk relationship ? 
  guardian reported that gchq was used to spy on the trump team . 
  nobody here cares , because it serves their politics . 
  whatever comes next is obvious . 
    the media is behaving like a political party  probably seems like that when you 're a donald cultist . 
  / u/footzz has an eu flair . 
  the media is actively condoning intelligence agencies going rogue and the leaking of full , unredacted conversations b/w potus and key allies . 
  democracy means the potus is in charge . 
  not some whitehall or langley chaps . 
  the media is doing their best to change that . 
   those who wish for further immigration , need to change tac . 
  or support a cause which is n't cultural demolition with a side of rape , murder , and subjugation . 
  \\  europe throughout history \\  present day discussions learn2read, 
  because you have no coherent views ? 
  please tell me how such divisions can be formed in the west if there are no islamists or islam loyalists in the west . 
  i 'm waiting . 
  there can be no such divisions within the west if you do n't invite in those who do n't belong in the west . 
   au revoir , auf wedersehen what , are you expecting to be rescued from your own stupidity ? 
   the entire goal of terrorist attacks is to cause the people to be disunited . 
   source ? 
  cause i have a source to the contrary , which clearly and cogently demonstrates the logic behind these acts of war . 
  and its this foundational document of a paedophile worshipping death cult , a cult your lot invited to peaceful nations .
