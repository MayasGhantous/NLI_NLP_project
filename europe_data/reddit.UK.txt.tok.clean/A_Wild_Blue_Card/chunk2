   i 'm talking more about a group of undeserving little shits most likely born into money who are you to decide if they deserve it ? 
  you ( presumably ) have 2 legs and 2 arms . 
  what makes you think you deserve that ? 
  who in their right mind wants that ? 
  easier to hire europeans on a temp basis . 
   overall , british people ( or belgians for that matter ) are simply not interested in exercising these jobs . 
  * low skill requirement jobs are n't compensated well . 
  * people want well paying jobs . 
  * immigrants end up doing those jobs . 
  it 's kinda obvious , going forth these jobs will be done by an ` underclass ' be it mechanized or hired from foreign nations . 
   well , certainly the tories and other `` elites '' will lead the way by picking fruit as well ? 
  do you understand how the free market works ? 
  people are compensated according to what they can demand from the marketplace , exchanging time and skills/connections for money and reward . 
  if that is how they can best be compensated , i 'm sure they 'd gladly do so . 
   i live in singapore . 
  i 'm european , my wife is chinese , my left neighbor is indian and top neighbor is malay , and you all live under a government which penalizes free speech and expression , has sharia like caning punishments for offending religious feelings - definitely not anti-blasphemy ordinance . 
   is n't that the case with most european countries as well before actually granting citizenship ? 
   do you understand what the us pledge of allegiance entails ? 
  you are swearing fealty to the flag and its constitution , to fight for that nation and abandon all external loyalties which may come before . 
  even then ` homegrown ' isis terrorists strike . 
  guy above you is dead wrong . 
  singapore has draconian laws to allow for peace in their nation and an overarching , censorship heavy government which allows for no free speech . 
  ca has massive drug problems related to legal immigrants and the usa ... is facing its own share of issues . 
  well , she 's not wrong . 
  multicultural ? 
  europe is multicultural . 
  there 's no lack of language , legendary works of art of all forms or philosophies that have come from europe ; both achdukes and citizens came from ideals born in europe . 
  to seek to fill a void which does n't exist in such a fortunate land is to ignore reality . 
  that never ends well . 
   a tree without roots will fall over , whereas a tree with roots eventually becomes part of a forest . 
  beautiful . 
  gorgeous watches . 
  it was . 
  that guy was human . 
  because the host nation 's politicians are n't adequately motivated . 
  and this forum still believes that citizens should n't be carrying weapons . 
  diplomatic immunity means shit against foreign citizens with loaded guns . 
  when the laws of your country protect foreign scum better than their own citizens , armed self defence is a necessity . 
  they actually look rather beautiful . 
  shame vermin like this sow wear them , tarnishing the image . 
  i love how the russian flair has a better grip on freedom than the self righteous flairs bsing . 
  it 's slavery with a probabilistic side of government murdering you . 
  it is . 
   some people really do need to do some shitty work in order to get over themselves , though  you might get away with your spoiled bullshit in school or at some job that your daddy got you , but the army does n't care and neither will the rest of the world . 
  yes , because that is what government should be about . 
  denying liberty from and hurling enforced labor upon its people . 
  what a fucking disgrace , and you even defend it on retarded grounds . 
  get over * yourself * . 
   i really do n't get what are problem is . 
  you sound very paranoid more like i know the facts of how this plays out . 
   there is nothing wrong with the government trying to find terrorists . 
  would you condone , then , the use of waterboarding ? 
   i really do n't care that the government has information about me . 
  do you think government is made up of unbiased , emotionless robots or humans with preference and prejudice ? 
  fair enough . 
  it 's just that this is the start for what is a very contentious and important topic , one which is both talked of in business and governmental solutions and is seeing a lot of research . 
  as someone interested , i can tell you that is n't even the best part . 
  suppose you discover demographic x is likely to vote for/against a proposal ( s ) . 
  you can use this to then model news cycles and messages over month to increase or reduce their voter turnout . 
  you could even attempt to identify 100-200 people in a town who gossip and send them , and them alone , targeted hitpieces as ads on policies/votes or even to sink public trust in a certain investment or project . 
  access to such data goes beyond insider trading level of knowledge . 
  form mental associations or negative perception of certain projects , competing industries . 
  especially if you consider cross elasticity and monopoly graphs . 
  ** ps - ** i get the verbosity of it , but trust me , given the way society is moving you may find it beneficial to read in depth sometime . 
  look around , it 's very well documented and explained in layman 's terms by mit/princeton/stanford profs in detail . 
  you 're missing what / u/signifyd 's comment points to - * once they get a ` hit ' on anyone they can get all their metadata and then profile like crazy ; and we have no real knowledge of which keywords are used and how common they are .

  ** if you have limited time , read the last one and the cia one . 
  **  as ** former national security agency general counsel stu baker stated last year , `` metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody 's life . 
  if you have enough metadata , you do n't really need content . '' **  ** but encryption ca n't mask metadata because it 's `` critical '' to verifying the authenticity of the transmitted data , ** says harlo holmes , director of newsroom digital security at digital-media rights group freedom of the press foundation . 
  and like phone call records collected by the nsa , message metadata can reveal a lot , ** including a clear picture of your social network ** -- especially if you use whatsapp groups . 
   * [ what you need to know about whatsapp 's new terms of service ] ( https://www.the-parallax.com/2016/09/16/whatsapp-new-terms-service/ ) *  similarly , `` an hour-long call at 3 a.m. to a suicide prevention hotline '' could be very revealing . 
  in fact , even a single piece of metadata could reflect an individual 's political or religious associations or mental health issues . 
   ** consider a short-term study at stanford that analyzed only a few months of telephony metadata from just 546 people focused partly on individual calls . 
  the researchers found many calls that even in isolation could be revealing , such as a call to a political campaign ** , noting : ** `` many organizations have a narrow purpose ** , such that an individual call gives rise to ** sensitive inferences ** . '' the study ** found `` numerous calls within our dataset that give rise to these sorts of straightforward inferences . '' **  by contrast , the government is collecting huge amounts of metadata -- by conservative estimates at least billions of call records . 
  and ** as the stanford study showed , these records are exponentially revealing in the aggregate : `` a pattern of calls will often , of course , reveal more than individual call records . 
  during our analysis , we encountered a number of patterns that were highly indicative of sensitive activities or traits . '' **  as important as the sensitivity of the information here is the fact that the potential sensitivity is exactly why the government wants the information . 
  ** the government has emphasized repeatedly , in speeches and in legal briefs that it needs to collect so much metadata specifically so that it can analyze complete ( or at least very big ) datasets . 
  ** that makes sense , since as we point out in our brief , this aggregation provides context and information to metadata , and ** allows analysts to create `` social graphs '' that map webs of relationships between individuals and groups . 
  in fact , aggregated metadata could allow an analyst to determine `` the membership , structure , or participants in organizations and movements like the naacp , the tea party , or occupy wall street . 
  . '' **  ** to compound the privacy invasion , metadata is highly structured , making it ideal for the kind of analysis that reveals highly personal information . 
  it 's easier to review than the content of communications . 
  ** and since the government 's argument is that all metadata is unprotected , it 's important not to consider it in a vacuum . 
  as we note , metadata `` is truly ubiquitous , created through the innumerable and near-continuous digital transactions and interactions attendant to modern life .

  ** it is no longer safe to assume that this `` summary '' or `` non-content '' information is less revealing or less sensitive than the content it describes . 
  ** just by using new technologies such as smart phones and social media , we leave rich and revealing trails of metadata as we move through daily life . 
  many details of our lives can be gleaned by examining those trails . 
  ** taken together , a group 's metadata can reveal intricacies of social , political , and religious associations .
