  you mean countries where mps and royalty have been linked to paedophile rings and the government is going after internet pornography ? 
  yes , that is surprising !, 
  goebbels would be proud . 
  i 'm outside . 
  this takes 2 minutes at most , while doing other stuff . 
  and seeing you admit to being the complete tyrant you are is worth every single second of it . 
   because that higher salary now , can result in a lower quality of life and reduced life expectancy for one simple example . 
  this can influence the quality of their work . 
   no one should be living in their trucks for months at a time . 
  good thing no one elected you to decide how they live their own lives . 
  why must you be such a totalitarian dictator ? 
  just use german kappa, 
  and quantitatively , but you do n't strike me as one to respect science . 
  you 're the genius demanding workers be paid more for their sake . 
  without concern for repercussions . 
   hey if they live in their truck for months , at least they get to buy a sandwich . 
  they should be grateful . 
  which was said where ? 
   and who cares that ikea posts larger and larger benefits and is one of the richest companies !, 
  you seem to , but i 've never commented on it . 
  mainly cause that 's , economically speaking , largely irrelevant . 
   all workers should tighten the belt . 
  lel said where ? 
  are you capable of reading a comment and responding to it , instead of whatever strange arguments the voices in your head are feeding you ? 
  i 've not seen such potent anti-intellectualism in months . 
  it 's less disgusting without the accompanying arrogance . 
   wage should be correlated with productivity a wage is a bargain . 
  the minimum price needed to get someone qualified to spend their time increasing your wealth . 
  great lawyers and irreplaceable sports/entertainment personalities are powerful in this negotiation . 
  if you 're easily replaceable , tough luck . 
  it 's a supply demand question , one you 're going to enjoy witnessing as mass low-skill immigration wrecks any semblance of working class power . 
  it 's great , however , for the rich and the educated classes ( who ca n't be replaced ) , as they 'll find it easier to hire . 
  hope you 're well settled into the latter . 
   such quality . 
  much work . 
  * privileged messiah from rich , welfare heavy country steps in . 
  `` pay your workers more , or do n't pay them at all ! '', 
  * some workers may get a raise . 
  many lose their jobs to richer countries , comparative advantage be lost and damned . 
  * no more poor workers \\* . 
  * \\* those still with jobs . 
  * feeder and support industries collapse . 
  much economic development . 
  * mission accomplished !, 
  macron is specifically asking for an increased minimum wage , across the eu , to protect french industry . 
  do n't get all sanctimonious bsing as if this is some benevolent measure . 
   an eu wide minimum wage * `` hey poor worker in a poor country !, 
  we 're not going to let you earn and support your family . 
  why ? 
  because some rich sod in a wealthier nation is entitled , and thinks it their right to price you out of the market . 
  why should the minimum wage be the same if ** purchasing power ** is n't ? 
  why should minimum wage be the same if ** work hours ** are n't ? 
  why should the minimum wage be the same if ** tax rates ** , for both employees and employers , are n't ? 
  why should the minimum wage be the same if ** union contracts ** are n't ? 
  i ca n't fathom the degeneracy required to think i should be fine with murderers of my family . 
  betrays your lack of any class whatsoever . 
  no , i expected a rational rationale , but it 's clear i asked for too much of you . 
  europeans , especially those on this forum . 
  provides contrast ; a real world example . 
  you seem angrier at your misconstrued version of my comment than the situation itself . 
  hmm . 
  i do n't get you people . 
  people violating your borders are invaders . 
  why arrest them ? 
  do you think china would arrest north koreans fleeing a war ? 
  or do you think they 'd use machine guns on the mobs if they tried to invade china ? 
  i 'm not advocating violence . 
  i 'm simply trying to understand the inculcated routines you execute . 
  on mobile . 
  guessing you 're a brit or balkan flair ? 
  oh , i wo n't be the one to argue against you . 
  i 'm a descendant of survivors of a muslim genocide . 
  and multiple other genocides committed upon my people by them . 
   why the fuck were you even there with your ngo ?? 
   a fucking ngo ferrying people to europe , what the hell is going on ?!, 
  i tend to lurk , but since he asked : * march 27th : [ italian officials call for investigation of soros-supported ngo migrant fleet ] ( http://disobedientmedia.com/italian-officials-call-for-investigation-of-george-soros-supported-ngo-migrant-fleet/ )  italian authorities are calling for ** monitoring of the funding of an ngo fleet bussing migrants into the eu from the north african ** coast after a report released the european border and coast guard agency has determined that the members of ** the fleet are acting as accomplices to people smugglers ** and directly contributing to the risk of death migrants face when attempting to enter the eu . 
   the report from regulatory agency frontex suggests that ngos sponsoring ships in the fleet are now acting as veritable accomplices to people smugglers due to their service which , in effect , ** provides a reliable shuttle service for migrants from north africa to italy . 
  the fleet lowers smugglers ' costs , ** as it all but eliminates the need to procure seaworthy vessels capable making a full voyage across the mediterranean to the european coastline . 
  ** traffickers are also able to operate with much less risk of arrest by european law enforcement officers ** . 
  frontex specifically noted that traffickers have intentionally sought to alter their strategy , sending their vessels to ships run by the ngo fleet rather than the italian and eu military . 
   ** in february 2016 , disobedient media published research indicating that multiple ships operating in the fleet mentioned by frontex are sponsored by ngo groups with financial ties to organizations run by george soros and donors to hillary clinton . 
  **  reports have also emerged citing a study by counter-extremism group quilliam which states that ** isis now controls the human trafficking scene in north africa and is actively recruiting from the migrant population ** . 
  in addition to acting as de facto accomplices of human traffickers , the ngo 's criticized by frontex may also be contributing to the worsening terror situation in europe though their actions . 
  * may : ** george soros secretly rushes to italy as ngos activity in the mediterranean now face political and judicial scrutiny ** * another : ** [ italian prime minister secretly receives george soros in rome ] ( http://www.pravdareport.com/world/europe/04-05-2017/137668-soros_in_rome-0/ ) **, 
   it 's just that the cause is not war but islam and/or arabian culture . 
  you 're making a case for taking not one soul . 
  many nations do . 
  it 's a guarantee of identity and leaves a distinct paper trail . 
  why ? 
  honestly , i 'd love to know what you 've assessed of my views , and which group you seem to think i 'd fit in . 
  not a challenge as much as pure , unadulterated curiosity . 
  why ? 
  why should taxes be even if governments use them differently ? 
  why should employee taxes be given to a host , instead of citizenship , country if the benefits are structured so ? 
  this entire proposal is a mix of protectionism of inefficiency , and ill-thought federal power expansion . 
  neither are responsible . 
  people budge when their wallets and groceries get hit . 
  that 's what sanctions do . 
  this rhetoric is too illiterate to be genuine from a man of macron 's intelligence and education . 
  it 's instead a threat of sanctions-via-regulations , and i 'm not sure people are as committed to principles in the face of economic doubt .
