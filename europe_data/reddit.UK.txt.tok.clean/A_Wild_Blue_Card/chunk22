  the shah in iran was ousted following abandonment by the working class and small traders . 
  same almost happened before the jcpoa nuke deal . 
  poland is n't in the same category , but sustained development is no small part of the current regime 's appeal . 
  to use such threats against allies is kinda despicable . 
  it 's absolute bs . 
  i almost guarantee you , as i said above , that this is a threat aimed at giving ammo to the domestic political opponents of the current government . 
  that , and to get them to cave or back off on other topics . 
  notice that such economic ignorance , using the cudgel of popular appeal/rhetoric , includes the topics of immigration and the soros university . 
  macron is too intelligent and educated to not know how ridiculous his proposal is . 
  it 's a clear this/or threat to poland/hungary from an establishment candidate . 
  political neophytes of this kind , especially given the media coverage and endorsements involved , as with obama , have no shortage of special interests involved . 
  hell , does anyone think macron is foolish enough to think immigration increases wo n't lower employee compensation , and exacerbate income inequality ? 
  and he 's getting after poland on this ? 
  lol . 
  absolutely . 
  everyone who endorsed him will be held accountable 5 years from now . 
  everyone will be `` tainted . '', 
  oh , and pressing hard on the eastern european states till a fracture forms is like / pol / fanfiction . 
   social dumping means countries having really low labour cost to try to bring companies/factories in . 
  it 's a big concern in france because a lot of factories are moving to eastern europe . 
  so the only choice that we have is either giving up on social rights or losing jobs . 
  that 's called comparative advantage , and every mnc with a hint of economic understanding will use it . 
  if france wants to price themselves out of the market , it 's not the fault of poland where a more business friendly environment exists . 
  ** unless you 're all but endorsing the notion of forcing poland to increase wages artificially , costing them thousands of jobs . 
  or penalties for countries which are n't as expensive , levelled on behalf of overpriced nations . 
  ** similarly with taxes : you ca n't force governments to increase their tax rates so that they 're as unappealing as the french . 
  if your society deems it prudent to tax the living hell out of everything , you do n't get to go and put a gun to the head of a more efficient economy . 
  cost of living is not the same across the eu , nor should it be . 
  the fun thing is that a different ppp applying to a single currency is a beautiful research concept , and the articles published on this since industrialisation and urbanisation began are immense . 
  yet nothing of the level of the eu has ever been seen post-colonialism -- bar maybe the united states . 
  hell , this was a major major reason a monetary union without a fiscal union was opponents . 
  it 's nonsensical . 
  the euro never should have been approved without one , and the officials at the time knew as much . 
  a mix of optimism and surety that the inevitable economic crises would create political will for a fiscal union meant it went through . 
  despite lisbon . 
  but that 's not the sole problem at hand . 
  ** i 'd almost say france sounds like the kind of place where you 'd get after uber 's life for providing a more efficient service . 
  then i realised , that actually is what happened . 
  ** ** edit : ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_to_gdp_ratio france clocks in at 47.9 % , which is insanely high . 
  * the only nations which get away with that are efficient , well-oiled systems with little/no corruption . 
  france is n't exactly denmark ( 50.8 ) , or * norway ( 43.6 ) -- which is still lower . 
  * * unlike nations which invest majority of it in infrastructure , education , or healthcare , functioning as social market economies , france seems to have government subsidies and `` protectionism '' of inefficient industries for purely political reasons . 
  * investment in education , healthcare and infrastructure means entry-level workers do n't have student loan inflated salaries ; that employees and industry is healthy ; investments and expansions easy . 
  france has gone the other way , and companies are paying into a system providing them nothing . 
  that 's just not sustainable , and macron is legit sounding like trump over here . 
  `` all '' is a tool to get that soros university open in hungary . 
  and push for a more agreeable leader in poland , via provision of `` hostile '' optics for domestic political opposition to play with . 
  using foreign bargaining ploys to secure more convenient regimes in other nations is a consistent practice throughout history . 
   `` we can not have a europe where ... when we are dealing with a member state behaving like ** poland or hungary - in matters of university , knowledge , refugees , fundamental values ** - it is decided not to do anything . '', 
  this would n't have anything to do with orban and the soros `` university '' , would it ? 
  it 's messed up enough that eu officials met with soros cause of the propaganda outlet of his . 
  you ca n't clobber over the head individual governments for protecting the sovereignty of their people and then purport to upholding democratic ideals . 
  self-determination is the foundation of democracy . 
  and that 's ignoring the question of why officials plan to meet and act as agents of a single american billionaire . 
  it reeks of corruption -- both financial and ideological . 
  ** ps - ** the eu going hard on the eastern countries which have historically known subjugation/islamist oppression is one of the ideal scenarios to exacerbate the dissolved of the potpourri , per many nationalists . 
  this will be fun . 
   at least french voters are n't pulling that `` all candidates are the same '' shit like in america . 
  that 's not what happened . . 
  i understand you must be sick of incorrect generalisations of french politics , but there 's no need to return the favour . 
  you know the russian flair is an inside joke now ? 
  well , ask ukraine if donetsk would 've liked this swiss knife against the bear . 
   but certainly not the standards of today who are saying that the structural deficit must be almost zero ( 0,5 % in the medium term ) which is just foolish economically speaking '' if the eu goes for relaxations here , it must ensure the 3 % deficit rule for inclusion is also followed . 
  so , about scotland . . his tax policy would expand `` federal '' power while also destroying the competitive advantages nations not taxing some 50 % gdp . 
  not for corporate tax rates , but because of investment and structuring . 
  it could possibly create a system where others will open up negotiations to get limits on tax levels . 
  as for the ecb , forcing lending at other-than-market rates is not a road worth travelling . 
  direct lending is very reasonable , even an important improvement , but the rate being artificially low incentivises madness . 
  he 's doing the right thing to attempt to increase cash flows , but to do so within his ideological restrictions is a messy task . 
  think it is n't ? 
  ask gaddafi and ukraine what happens when you give up the nuclear weapon deterrent . 
  thanks for explaining it so well . 
  not to mention the burden on education , healthcare , public transport and poor housing will all disproportionately hurt the less privileged . 
  charity begins at home . 
  fdr has got to be the most overrated douche in politics . 
  you 're not answering how to reconcile the above position with a pro-migrant stance . 
  whataboutism is boring . 
   racist clowns around surely help so they 'd be c2 fluent in french if not for racism ? 
  it 's easy to care for freedom when we can make ends meet . 
  i 'm pretty libertarian , but i do have a responsibility to ask myself if i 'd feel so even if i was less fortunate . 
  that has to be done before passing judgment on others . 
   people elected a president which , i agree , is much more likely to abuse their power than previous presidents have been like killing americans without trial ; using the irs against political opponents ; shouting at the supreme court on national television and getting mobs to threaten them ; lying about kuwaiti incubators and chemical weapons ; mass warrant-less surveillance ; and ** locking up political opponents and documentary filmmakers , prosecuting under gag orders ? 
  ** us presidents have already done that all . 
  not really , i just want to see how internally consistent the arguments are . 
  using a more visceral/emotion-driven topic was only a means to that end . 
  i 'm perfectly fine with any answer , just want to see how you think . 
  \\ ^ this is true . 
  the first thing seen is security including food and basic necessities . 
  ** the vast majority of individuals lacking prosperity would view voting on `` ideals '' or `` philosophy '' ; views like liberty or fascism , privilege . 
  ** i could make a case that the wealthy deserve an equal tax rate . 
  would anyone care one hoot for that argument if they themselves were feeling oppressed ? 
   well now we get to see once more why relative poverty is n't a good thing . 
  if you feel that way about relative poverty , what 's your take on importing millions of migrants reliant on government handouts ? 
  wait , also make them insular communities struggling with the language . 
  then we can really get the information disconnect going !, 
  trust me , i sympathize and feel similarly . 
  i 've been fortunate enough to see some cogs turning , and let me assure you that these elite apologists are more useful idiots than they can imagine . 
  the same arguments they now use for people who earn 1/2 -1 / 4 as much are voiced of them manifold . 
  by individuals 100x as wealthy , and provided intellectual cover for by what was just spouted above . 
  i 'm gon na enjoy this .
