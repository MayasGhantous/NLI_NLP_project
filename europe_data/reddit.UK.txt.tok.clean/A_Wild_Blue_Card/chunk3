  ** ** metadata is naturally organized in a way that lends itself to analysis , and a growing set of computing tools can turn these trails into penetrating insights . 
  given limited analytical resources , analyzing metadata is often a far more powerful analytical strategy than investigating content : it can yield far more insight with the same amount of effort . 
  **  ** inspectors general at practically every federal agency -- including the nsa26 -- have hotlines through which misconduct , waste , and fraud can be reported , while numerous state tax agencies have dedicated hotlines for reporting tax fraud . 
  hotlines have also been established to report hate crimes , arson , illegal firearms and child abuse . 
  in all these cases , the metadata alone conveys a great deal about the content of the call , even without any further information .

  yet , if individual 's patterns are unique enough , outside information can be used to link the data back to an individual . 
  for instance , ** in one study , a medical database was successfully combined with a voters list to extract the health record of the governor of massachusetts27 . 
  in another , mobile phone data have been re-identified using users ' top locations28 . 
  finally , part of the netflix challenge dataset was re-identified using outside information from the internet movie database29 . 
  **  others are discovering the same thing . 
  ** ethan zuckerman ** , who recently co-taught a class with one of the authors of the paper above , cesar hidalgo , ** wrote about how two students in the class created a project called immersion , with hidalgo , which takes your gmail metadata ( `` just metadata '' ) and maps out your social network . 
  as zuckerman notes , his own use of immersion reveals some things that could be questionable or dangerous . 
  **   anyone who knows me reasonably well could have guessed at the existence of these ties . 
  ** but there 's other information in the graph that 's more complicated and potentially more sensitive . 
  ** my primary media lab collaborators are my students and staff -- cesar is the only media lab node who 's not affiliated with civic who shows up on my network , which suggests that i 'm collaborating less with my media lab colleagues than i might hope to be . 
  ** one might read into my relationships with the students i advise based on the email volume i exchange with them -- i 'd suggest that the patterns have something to do with our preferred channels of communication , but it certainly shows who 's demanding and receiving attention via email . 
  in other words , absence from a social network map is at least as revealing as presence on it . 
  **  separately , ** more than two years ago , we wrote about how a german politician named malte spitz got access to all of the metadata that deutsche telekom had on him over a period of six months , and then worked with the german newspaper die zeit to put together an amazing visualization that lets you track six months of his life entirely via his metadata , combined with public information , such as his twitter feed .

  personal phone calls can also reveal sensitive medical information : `` you can see a call to a gynecologist , and then a call to an oncologist , and then a call to close family members . '' and information from cell-phone towers can reveal the caller 's location . 
  metadata , she pointed out , can be so revelatory about whom reporters talk to in order to get sensitive stories that it can make more traditional tools in leak investigations , like search warrants and subpoenas , look quaint . 
  `` you can see the sources , '' she said . 
  when the f.b.i.

   if anything , the parties take on a bigger responsibility because when they lose on a a particular issue , it 's because they failed to convince the public . 
  there 's a huge emotional and perceived difference b/w . failure to convince us to make a good decision . 
  and * you made an evil decision and that reflects on you morally * . 
  yeah , that 's why i oppose stuff like this . 
   and most voters do n't give a shit because `` i have nothing to hide '' ( this is the ` argument ' i 've heard most often from my ( otherwise well educated ) friends ) . 
  i 've seen how effective and accurate metadata analysis is . 
  people really do n't like to accept how well human populations can be modeled and manipulated . 
  it 's insane . 
   actually , yes . 
  this is what our democracies are all about no , democracies are about empowering the democracy within the constraints of the constitution - which requires a super majority to amend . 
  they are never about saying that a group of smart people knows better than you , because that inevitably follows the path to plutocracy . 
   who programs the trojans ? 
  the ndb has neigher the manpower nor the know-how to do that . 
  are we going to waste more money on shady companies like hacking team ( zurich police wasted 500k already ) .

   then , they can send the keyword list from their request to internet providers and those will send back data corresponding to those keywords . 
  no nsa style dumping of the entire internet traffic to be data mined someday . 
   that request needs renewal every three months . 
  data collected will be erased after one year iirc , unless it 's necessary for a trial . 
  is this anonymous , or are individual ips/people identifiable ? 
  is the list of keywords limited , or are they free to add any keyword that will enable them to get all traffic of an individual/group they plan to target ? 
  you realize that with any geo-location info and metadata analysis they can profile citizens ? 
  then target them as in ( 2 ) . 
  sorry i 'm cynical , but it 's more often than not appropriate in this matter . 
   i think there should be some wider logic behind that . 
   that referendums could only broaden civil liberties and not tighten them . 
  makes a very compelling case for everyone to err on the side of not granting then permanent rights - it stifles progress . 
   should there ever be a need to tighten them , it should be a job of the parliament with at least a little more sanity and responsibility . 
  * so your argument to expand the rights of citizens is to reduce the rights enjoyed by citizens ? 
  interesting :  *, 
   surveillance on themselves and possible invasion of their own privacy ? 
  ** because no one believes * they * are are terrorists ; targets . 
  direct democracy means no one has to run on a record of their votes on various bills , least not to the level in representative democracy .

   however , we frequently hear about huge inequality . 
  the other developed country with relatively high inequality is the us , but in their case they at least have a scapegoat ( `` muh diversity '' ) . 
   the uk is split based on various criteria including location ( london : industry - north : : nyc : less opportunity plains ) , immense diversity compared to homogeneous scandinavia and inter-generational income inequality which occurs in all markets with a surplus of labor or higher population density . 
   and nobody asked the local inhabitants of north america if they were happy . 
  many of the exchanges were agreed upon , literally signed on . 
  i have and i would n't put it in the same tier as the aforementioned nations . 
  even certain parts of hk fare better . 
  this is factually incorrect . 
  the usa was n't ruled by an involuntary empire for more than 2-3 years preceding the colony 's revolt . 
  australia was hardly conquered , nor was nz . 
  the commonwealth is quite different from the anglosphere . 
  it does n't include the usa , and its criterion for inclusion does n't happen to be based on a common language . 
  of course not , the involuntary union actually defended each other against evil - be it in the form of nazi racists or communist scum . 
   spanish replacing english in the us not replacing . 
  just even a several thousands of illegal immigrants which do n't speak english is a primary language . 
   good for a non-anglo country . 
  precisely . 
   now adjust for the population size and you are still shit adjust for awesome and still the best collection of nations . 
  only considering nations where english is the language . 
  singapore 's english is n't as great as you may expect , fiji , jamaica , india all have other main languages . 
  singapore and india both have english as the universal tongue b/w different groups but have multiple other languages - english almost always being the 2nd or even 3rd language in india . 
  consistently , i 've mentioned that usa may have a risk of dropping out in a few decades if spanish takes a hold . 
   anglosphere would probably just be the uk and her former colonies . 
  english speaking nations . 
  forget mexico , the usa might be kicked out soon . 
  us = 121 uk = 67 australia = 29 new zealand = 18 canada = 22 anglosphere = 257,

  true , if only people aspired more frequently to such great heights : , 
   everything i have read suggests that the brexit department is the place to be for high-flyers on the fast-track for career advancement in the civil service . 
  and those from the private sector who may finally have a job in post-eu british civil service . 
  an entire generation of civil service applicants knew that brussels and the eu system meant a reduced demand for them , and opted for other career paths .
