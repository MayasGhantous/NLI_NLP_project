  now , not only do they have opportunity , but a good job here would let them skip the cumbersome bureaucratic queue which curtails promotion and advancement . 
   all i see recently is bbc , telegraph , standard , dm writing about recovery and ` great british future ' outside the eu . 
  the same existing bias which pushes * for * uk outlets to print such stories pushes * against * eu centric outlets from in any way ` encouraging ' or ` not disincentivizing enough ' the leave camp in every existing nation - even if that means ignoring pertinent news . 
  this is not to dismiss your claim , i agree entirely with you , but rather to extend it in both directions . 
  nvm , just saw the flag . 
  my ears are hurting . 
  true , but that calculation assumes literally everyone is a descendant of that dude . 
  there 's also that bit about the covenant , applying only to abraham and co. , and keeping it by the 8th day ( aka getting cut off ) or being cut off . 
   because you say so , of course . 
  there is no rule against yelling so ... where the fuck did i say there is a rule against yelling , genius ? 
   stop spreading lies learn to read before throwing accusations like a loony nutjob . 
  assume noah 's ark is fact . 
  assume . 
  all that establishes is that god really lost his cool with all life , cause some humans were acting like jerks . 
  it concluded with god announcing that never again would all life on earth be punished to eradication , * by god * , for the misdeeds of man . 
  nothing is said therein that humanity ca n't destroy the animal and plant life it has dominion over ( according to the same genesis ) , nor that god is obligated to save humanity as a whole from collective stupidity at a planetary scale . 
  ************ no need to eat his bait and make it a religious issue . . * this guy 's tenuous grasp of logic is so wonky he ca n't make a case even with his goddamn `` facts '' . 
  * ******** ** edit : ** just realized that god did promise abraham that his descendants would * `` be fruitful and multiply . 
  '' * assuming that he brings that up to deny the magnitude of the situation . 
  yet ** the comparison made in genesis was always that his * `` seed '' * would be `` countless as the sand or stars . '', 
  if beaches erode and atmospheric pollution blots out the stars , god may have himself a loophole here :p **, 
   stop hating the girl without any reason , i cant believe the things i had read today about her , is people being sore losers or plain sexism ? 
  it is a goddamn reason when someone yells their lungs out to get an advantage 2 . 
  ** sexism ? 
  this was a match b/w two women , one of which was n't a fucking banshee **, 
  badminton is n't a yelling game . 
  funny as your comment is , you 're kinda missing the cultural aspect . 
  badminton is a major thing in east and south-east asia , and india . 
  it 's more like the united states or france getting involved in cricket than a pygmy beating phelps . 
  apart from / u/zephinism 's link , reminder that pakistan was linked to north korea ( & libya ) getting the nuke - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abdul_qadeer_khan#north_korea.2c_iran_and_libya * then in 2015 they helped north korea get the fusion bomb . 
  * ** recently pakistan laundered and transported chinese nuclear technology , and monel , inconel to north korea **  agency sources said that entities from the pakistan energy commission ( paec ) have been continuing to supply restricted items such as ` monel ' and ` inconel ' material to north korea in violation of the un sanctions . 
   the china atomic energy authority ( caea ) recently received a written complaint that supplies from a chinese company , beijing suntech technology company limited , bound for pakistan were being diverted to north korea by the pakistani authorities . 
  what we 're seeing here is little more than tail raising and measuring up e-peens , in a diplomatic setting . 
  it only matters if this continues for more than a few months . 
   we 've descended into shit flinging politics . 
  implying that has n't always been the case ? 
  * have bad relations with an enemy lord ? 
  spread rumors that he will raise taxes and that his wife jumps everything including moonboy * have a problem with a successor ? 
  question the legitimacy ( william the conqueror/bastard ) * dislike a people/peoples ? 
  declare them heretics ( christian history ) * need to rile up your people for war ? 
  brand the enemy bourgeoisie oppressing the proletariat , evil atheists , etc. 
  branding has a long history in the pr that goes along with politics and strife . 
  ** edit : ** does anyone here think putin is legitimately worse than the gulf retards whose nations work on a slave underclass ? 
  you try not to anger dear leader or you honor thy quran if you 're talking about countries where your assumption is true . 
   its actually a huge dilemma , in calais people forced themselves to help illegals so they dont loot stores and rob people that 's called extortion . 
  and it 's never combated by cowardly capitulation , but by unapologetic enforcement of the law . 
  how does that hurt roma kids ? 
  it 's the others who will be hit . 
  does n't sound like the worst thing . 
  if they 're inviting someone into their house they have a right to discern and discriminate - selectively permeable , in a way . 
  except it says it will not allow choice of ethnicity by the adopting party . . 
   yeah , honestly with our declining pop , we 'll evetually be unable to pay pensions as the workforce continues to decline . 
  and hitting youth employment/satisfaction , which making them compete in a harder jobs market does , is only going to exacerbate that declining population stat . 
  many places have laws against firing people just for their age . 
  if that is the case , expect firings based on performance reviews . 
  hell , there might be possible test seminars where employees are judged on the ability to quickly imbibe new information and working memory . 
  may achieve the same purpose . 
  what this definitely will impact is entry level jobs - fresh out of college workers with little new to show will , in certain fields , be competing with those who have decades of experience . 
  youth employment/satisfaction , and possibly birth rate going forth 10-15 years from now takes a hit . 
  white guilt is basically the white man 's burden with a side of social justice . 
  literally cancer . 
  korea and japan have no semblance of true free speech or transparency and are corrupt - you may get welfare but never be free . 
  arab states will retain it , though it is based on the slave labor of your and my people . 
  i hope they rot . 
  which state are you from , again ? 
   but for the scandinavian model to succeed it needs a homogeneous society . 
  if any lesson is to be learnt from scandinavia its that to make america more of a welfare state the socialist slogan should be `` make america white again '' . 
  and i am saying that as a gay brown man . 
  so , rip welfare states worldwide ? 
   and honestly america has proven so far to be uncapable of holding up immigrants from latin america , illegal immigrants . 
  no need to liken them to the vast majority of skilled talent from europe and asia who paved their own way , or the polish , italian and other immigrants who came in droves before the welfare state existed . 
   and a full welfare state model would attract unemployed , chanceless people from this region in masses to america . 
  already does . 
  hence the trouble with mexico . 
    funds and strengthens parallelsocities  in what way a social welfare state can cause this ? 
  remove the welfare state . 
  you either integrate or gtfo . 
  ghettos , `` immigrant '' hovels and the sort only function with welfare . 
  without it you must learn the language and be a productive member of society , having to integrate into it . 
    removes incentives to work and improve your own situation ( i.e. 
  social mobility )  it 's the quite opposite to be fair . 
  [ in significant areas , social inheritance is not broken more in denmark than in the us .

  about 4000 miles . 
   incapable of running a budget ( european youth can look forward to huge debts )  this needs to be expanded upon . 
  any model which constantly needs a larger base to pay off old debts is bound for failure . 
  whether it be pensions/healthcare/etc in europe causing an overzealous attitude re : unvetted immigration or us social security which is approaching insolvency and has been likened to a ponzi scheme by critics . 
  further , what is n't truly appreciated : * the post-ww2 europe model only works in a system where the united states is defending the majority of nations , their inadequate military forces compensated for by an ally footing the bill * medical research does n't go well with price setting ; us pharmaceutical companies rake in profits domestically and sell cheaper products overseas the second point is grossly understated in public . 
  reminder that pharmaceutical companies need to have successful products pay for not just * their * investment , but to recoup investment in all the approaches that failed . 
  a free market ( aka when you do n't force people to give you their money ) needs incentives , and telling investors that there is n't money to be made saving lives sees them spend it on cosmetics/skin/beauty products or elsewhere entirely . 
  definitely not centuries of accumulated art , architecture and culture . 
   sure if you first democratically change the legislation to make it legal . 
  the whole point of a constitution is to prevent retarded , authoritarian and completely immoral acts accredited by fiat . 
  whether that fiat be autocratic or populist . 
   i do n't know why you bring up some kind of communism , taxing all my property means no property rights , eh ? 
  it is what you proposed , with all property right * awarded * by the government instead of natural ones * protected by * the government . 
   again change it democratically , i wo n't vote for your party though . 
  it 's the same principle you proposed , just now applied to you . 
   i am a firm believer in the social contract and democracy . 
  not in the sense that it will always be ethically right but because it 's the best system we have .
