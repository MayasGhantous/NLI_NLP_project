  that definition , with no regard to the basic and rudimentary truth that might ( popularity ) does n't make right is what lead to nazi malarkey . 
   the parliament do have right to decide upon the capital structures of society no it does n't . 
  if you have 2 poor people and bill gates in a room , and 2 vote to confiscate all his property , that does not make it right . 
    want to kill all the jews ? 
  why ? 
  you do n't exactly care for minority rights . 
  or perhaps it 's cause you 're not in the mood right now , but if popular enough in the future you 'll go right along . 
    it 's not like it 's killing everyone , just that minority group , so who cares ? 
   not really solid argument . 
  such eloquence . 
  wow . 
   it 's not like the money goes to waste . 
  it 's used by government . 
  can we confiscate all your property and use it for the same purpose ? 
  how about confiscating all bodies of the deceased and using them for research ? 
   their kids will be fine even if they do n't have 3 billion euro . 
  you 'll be fine if given bread , water and some multivitamins . 
  you can manage in a single bunk . 
  government has no right to decide someone has `` enough '' money and then just seize the rest - that 's what property rights prevents . 
   it 's not like they are taxing the middle class with 40 % . 
  want to kill all the jews ? 
  it 's not like it 's killing everyone , just that minority group , so who cares ? 
  wikileaks does n't claim to represent victims . 
  only facts which are buried . 
   the government taking all of your assets after your death would be ridiculous . 
  it goes against the very concept of recognition of personal property , and assumes that you only `` leased '' what you have from the state and the government gets to choose what to do with it when you die . 
  it 's a ridiculous position and is only allowed because of popular support from the very people who cry about `` minorities '' while , here , abusing the tyranny of the majority . 
   40 % is taking the piss . 
   nobody in their right mind would pay that , 40 % to get what your family made , presumably for you and your siblings , and another 40 % when you die and wish to leave your life 's work for your kids . 
  it 's absolutely retarded . 
   if the rich do n't pay their share of the tax bill , if `` the rich '' already pay a great portion of taxes in most nations , and either way the death tax is cruel and asinine . 
  you 're saying someone involved in intelligence operations could ever play so dirty ? 
  impossible . 
   why use made up rumours when you can use the fact he 's a fugitive from sexual offences charges related to his non consensual sex with two women . 
  because when you reveal us secrets and videos implicating individuals in war crime you make no powerful enemies :  are you truly so daft as to think those allegations are incapable of being a means to discredit/kill him ? 
  sanctions only hit the poor . 
  what you 're advocating is getting putin killed , just by proxy of his own citizens . 
  have the guts to say what you 're calling for , at the very least . 
  syria in because any chance of assad being replaced soon is dissipating rapidly . 
  shh . . that 's not a word they like over here . 
  actually , yes . 
   so you think we should all listen to putin ? 
  nope . 
  i 'm just a dude finding this whole thing most interesting . 
  will make a good read for posterity . 
  he made those comments before the eu took that step . 
  that is , if they had been consistently heard all the way back , he 'd not have the advantage he today possesses . 
   i 'm pretty sure that putin is happy about brexit and would advocate weakening the eu . 
  sure , but at the cost of strengthening a radical islam cause in any form ? 
  the chechen situation is n't exactly hunky dory . 
   the nra is much more dangerous than some random ` imam ' talking to half a dozen teenagers in wales . 
  `` a government by consent and an armed populace capable of defending themselves is wore than advocating mass rape/murder . '', 
  genius : , 
  his past statements actually create a net negative for the eu decision , discouraging it . 
  so he ended up here even after somehow working against that which lead to this state . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  and importing the elements which they can have a shot at radicalizing . 
  tbf , he is n't a fan of refugees , and was less than neutral w.r.t advocating mass influx . 
  the brexit vote was what , 52/48 ? 
  more than close enough to swing the other way if not for that . 
   if he is n't a citizen , then deport . 
  prevention  cure, 
  because the nra and the political muscle 2a groups wield is the same as telling people to rape , pillage and murder en masse . 
   german business goes nuts and politicians cant hold up this stupid sanctions forever it 's a game of who it hurts more , and there 's no real way sanctions are going to give russia reason to back out of crimea . 
  russia has to have their port , the region controlled is exceedingly russian ( linguistically ) according to even ukrainian census numbers and fossil fuel heavy . 
   ... and no german politician even believe in this sanctions , they do it because order from usa . 
  do you mean this truly or as in , `` they sell it as a us idea to the population that votes for them '' ? 
   dat russia-turkey-iran triple alliance is too swee countries seeking better relations with russia : * syria ( assad 's likely to remain ) * iran * turkey * [ japan ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-ally-japan-pursues-russian-friendship-1462331574 ) * great britain * possibly us ( if trump wins ) putin 's none too popular , but anyone else think he 's deserving of a round of applause , taking advantage of 2016 ?

   odd as it may seem , the law allows the us to constitutionally send jack-booted commandos to fly over fields of innocent tulips , swoop into the land of wooden shoes , tread past threatening windmills and sleepy milk cows into the dutch capital -- into a city synonymous with international law -- and pry loose any us troops . 
  what a ridiculous article . 
  if the united states does n't recognize dutch jurisdiction over its soldiers , who are internationally deployed against enemies and terrorists , they would of course take measures to protect them or enable themselves to do so . 
   allows the us to constitutionally send jack-booted commandos cause protecting your citizens from unrecognized , busybody foreign powers is constitutionally a government right and duty . 
   it 's a competition where the best athletes from all parts of the world come together to find out who is the best . 
  you mean like the fifa , pga tour , tour de france , grand slams or cricket world cup ?

  ** how hard is that ? 
   we have n't even got to a point where you can openly say you dislike islam without reprisals from your own government . 
  can you please explain why that this could ever exist does n't bother you ? 
  that the government has the power to punish you for saying you dislike or stand against something ? 
  free speech exists solely to protect that which might offend , annoy or otherwise bother someone - if that was n't the case , it would n't be needed . 
  `` ban the burqa ! '', 
  was a phrase that people used to take the piss out of people who had concerns about immigration . 
  it 's cause those who wanted islamist immigration were isolated , limousine liberals or sheltered folk . 
  they propagated the notion of meaningless borders , everyone being a friend in a different situation and willingly chose to ignore the advice of more begrudged nations/individuals who have seen islam and the culture up close , thinking they were smarter or more `` progressive '' . 
  turns out unearned moral superiority is no match for reality , in the form of aloha snackbar murdering innocents , smacking you in the face . 
  i 'm more disheartened that they tolerate * this * political stance when the olympics are meant to remain apolitical - and have been rather incredulously so in the past . 
  yet , when [ saudi arabia boycotts israel in judo ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/saudi-judo-competitor-forfeits-match-avoid-israeli-next-round-reports-488342 ) , part of a [ larger trend of antisemitism from middle east nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boycotts_of_israel_in_sports ) , they do n't disqualify the saudis .

  ** edit : ** when black americans , & a nice dude , took a real political stance which took courage they were penalized . 
  consistency demands that if `` screw racism '' is condemned , maybe `` europeanism  nationalism '' be as well . 
   maybe nato should orchestrate a real coup in turkey . 
  is n't nato only for defense ? 
  or is that only an argument used when european countries want to abandon the usa ? 
  next thing to drop : mixtapes, 
  that may or may not rightfully elicit such a response from you , but that itself has little bearing on the veracity of what / u/draguouo said . 
  if anything , as a cynic , it adds credence the this possibility .
