  the more you look at this it seems inconceivable that some of the smartest minds in the world thought it would work . 
  seems more like a gambit to create a fiscal union years down , using a crisis ' contingency responses and panic to do what voters may not all support - not entirely unlike certain bailouts . 
  and then more was bitten off than could be chewed , w / the refugee crisis piled on top . 
  more importantly , this would never have come to pass . 
  it is n't my proposal to integrate further . 
  it is instead , to simply suggest that this ideal of a monetary union without an economic one was naive optimism . 
  at best . 
  or knowing sabotage to arm twist nations into a fiscal union , if you are feeling particularly cynical . 
  policies which would have become impossible to pursue way before the boiling point if market forces had been allowed to provide feedback and self-regulate . 
  the isolation b/w the euro ( greek currency ) and greek 's own policies , with the eurozone as a whole acting as a proxy , is what let the situation get out of hand to the degree that it did . 
   poor economic performance means politicians are being asked , or even worse , take on the initiatives themselves to improve the situation , which cause a negative response by a market , that can not just be adjusted by a wave with a magic wand . 
  it 's even worse . 
  even assuming there is political will and enough intellect to fix and regulate , you 're still `` fixing '' and regulating . 
  it is n't a floating system that self-corrects in real time with the market accuracy which periodic legislative attempts can never hope to achieve . 
  ** as long as the eurozone exists in its current form , there will remain dissonance between monetary and fiscal policy . 
  ** the only real solution involves `` federal '' or central control over fiscal policies of nations . 
  * ** [ george soros , project syndicate ] ( https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-promise-of-regrexit-by-george-soros-2016-07 ) **  first , a clear distinction must be drawn between membership of the eu and of the eurozone . 
  those fortunate countries that are not members of the eurozone should not face discrimination . 
  if the eurozone wants to be more closely integrated , as it should be , ** it needs to have its own treasury and budget , to serve as a fiscal authority alongside its monetary authority , the european central bank . 
  ** * ** [ larry elliott , guardian : greece 's problems are the result of the eurozone having no fiscal policy ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/01/greece-problems-eurozone-fiscal-policy-germany ) **  what 's more , the lesson from the last five years is that those countries that use the euro are paying a heavy price for the lack of a common system for transferring resources from one part of the single-currency area to another . 
  ** there is one currency and one interest rate , but there is no fiscal union to stand alongside monetary union . 
  **  so , unlike in the us or the uk , there is no large-scale method for recycling the taxes raised in those parts of the eurozone that are doing well into higher spending for those parts of the eurozone that are doing badly . 
  ** mark carney pointed out this weakness in a lecture in dublin last week when he said : `` it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that , if the euro were a country , fiscal policy would be substantially more supportive . '' **, 
  all those morons who cry about this stuff happening all the time in * certain * countries and never getting attention sure got their wish . . 
    has to do with the fact that 's linking , not implying sole cause . 
   technically correct the best kind . 
  it 's not misleading if you follow the american scene at all . 
   right now you wrote us public spending on education is $ 70b and on health care $ 66 billion . 
  i referenced the discretionary spending at the federal level . 
  i never said that was for the state level . 
  does merkel 's government count ? 
   you are mixing up federal , state and local level spending . 
  i am advocating a greater focus on education , particularly research , efficacy and standards needed for competitive employability at a federal level . 
  including a possible focus on targeted basics in primary education and tackling the current system of meme level prices for new editions of college books . 
  how about a box of the `` military grade '' ar-15s ? 
   will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , okay , send a single goddamn predator . 
  after all ,  `` germany dont need protection , since we dont have rivals/enemies '' - / u/krosse _ ente, 
   germany dont need protection , since we dont have rivals/enemies . 
  wait , you 're serious ? 
   see , but now you 're equating the entire spending on military matters vs what they spend on nato . 
   the united states does n't need to invest nearly as much if they were n't almost single-handedly protecting erstwhile `` allies '' while engaging increasingly in the south china sea - one of the few theatres it is prudent to intervene . 
   it also has nothing to do with the us not being able to afford it , 20 trillion down has a lot though . 
  and a debtor state providing free military help is n't wise . 
   and i 'm also in favour of the us to stop playing world police , but i do n't buy the argument that somehow europe is responsible for underfunded domestic affairs . 
  do n't suggest that is the case . 
  but it is a major factor . 
   america gets influence and military bases to project their power by being in nato . 
  and without nato , many nato members will align with russia , like turkey seems to be doing at the moment . 
  good luck with that . 
  because of geopolitics parts of europe will always be competing with russia . 
  poland and the uk have met their obligations . 
  do n't think trump intends to ever abandon them . 
  as for some others , many are open minded . 
   but there 's a big difference between spending on defence when you have a massive defence industry , like the us ( which is basically just investing in your own economy through a detour ) there are masses of communities which will be eradicated or outdated and rendered unemployable and have regions collapse . 
  this sort of investment in defence pays out short term , maybe . 
  long term the workforce needs to be brought to be more competitive . 
   that does n't even make sense . 
  if americans do n't get good housing or education then it 's only america 's fault . 
   the us spends some 3.4 % on its military . 
  1.4 % of $ 17.9 trillion is $ 250 billion . 
  the us government 's discretionary spending on : * education - $ 69.98 billion * medicare and health - $ 66.03 billion * veteran 's affairs - $ 65.32 billion * housing and community - $ 63.24 billion that 's roughly 260 billion . 
  it could be doubled . 
  every goddamn year . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/ ) i hope you understand why it might be extremely popular for the us to stop playing global sheriff . 
  us could just defend germany with a single predator drone . 
  putin might like that : , 
   what about ` peace ' ? 
  germany is surrounded by friendly countries , we are not that active on the international level so you are n't worth the protection , since you do n't really protect your allies . 
   if he were a trustworthy person and he had said `` we must talk to our allies about their obligations and our obligations ... '' , that would be something within the bounds of reason . 
   [ here is trump talking he 's sick of japan , germany not paying their fair share . 
  28 years ago . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/seps17_akti ), 
    obligations  the 2 % are still not mandatory . 
  nor is using the full strength of the us military . 
  if germany is invaded , it will be absolutely hilarious if trump sends a single predator to `` defend '' it . 
   so why did n't he say `` countries that do n't fulfill their obligations have to leave nato '' ? 
   did those countries leave the nato ? 
  no , they instead stayed and ignored their obligations . 
  maybe the us should follow their lead . 
  [ example : germany spends about 1.2 % compared to the agreed minimum of 2 % ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs ), 
   two threads rising to the top , both removed . 
  wonder if it is because only a handful of nato nations are living up to their own obligations and not freeloading off of the usa . 
   ** [ only poland this year joined the four other countries , out of 28 total nato members , that are meeting the alliance 's goal of spending 2 % of their gross domestic product on defense . 
  the other four are the u.s. , great britain , greece and estonia . 
  ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/nato-calls-for-rise-in-defence-spending-by-alliance-members-1434978193 ) ** i know / r/europe has a hate boner for the us , but maybe the reason us citizens are living in comparatively less palatable circumstances has to do with the fact that they are subsidizing the defence of other countries which then get to invest in education and healthcare us citizens do n't get . 
   is it really ? 
  it just does n't compute for me , maybe my non-religious brain is missing something but it just makes no sense . 
  all that effort for what ? 
  would you die to stop evil ? 
  would you wage a war against an ideology you found so repugnant that its existence was wrong ? 
  congrats , you found out what islamists think about western civilization . 
   why do they do this . 
  they hate you ? 
  they want to kill you ? 
  they 'll find a way to do so . 
   just leave europe alone you pricks just protect your borders and keep them out . 
  or you know , do n't invite them . 
  we 've dealt with worse before and won . 
  but ca n't when people call us racists whenever we stand up for life , liberty and our own values . 
   if you want to talk about how a country 's attitude effect others you should look into a country called greece - the train wreck of europe k $ k,
