  that and the futility of war as all the empires collapsed and you could n't fight to own xyz foreign colony . 
   if anyone 's going to get rid of the guy it should be a coalition of nearby friendly countries so anyone who opposes the eu gets taken out by regional rivals . 
  are you joking or just a megalomaniac by proxy ? 
  wait , what ? 
  has the eu reached the point where they are fine with such `` elections '' which would put erdogan to shame , long as the right countries join ? 
  oh , and links/articles please . 
  or at least details on what you said about vote checking and bribes . 
  thanks !, 
  those are n't all . 
  recognize that not all ideologies are compatible with freedom and individual rights , and require strict assimilation or removal . 
  to bite the bullet and actually deport or revoke asylum for every criminal or recalcitrant case . 
  this includes cutting welfare and instead requiring gainful employment . 
  and to learn from the suffering of the past and not demolish the most comfortable existence humanity has known in the name of `` multiculturalism . '', 
  i 'm trying to point out why we are witnessing an utterly chaotic response . 
  jinnah was an islamist . 
  india has had multiple muslim presidents , part of the tolerance most nations have . 
  pakistan hardly has any non-muslims , awarded all the minority rights you can expect from an islamic republic . 
  google : jewish population in < arab state  or hindu population in pakistan . 
  enjoy !, 
  hopefully . 
  like it or not , there 's no going alone and i want to see this language and its nations prosper . 
  india has countless languages , ironically english is the only one you may find geographically universal ( with the educated ) . 
  up is both the biggest and most criminal state in the nation . 
  sectarian violence , politicians spending millions erecting giant statues of themselves and legit underworld bosses getting elected is all par for the course . 
  pakistani shias are regularly linked to terrorism . 
  when the ba'ath came to power , they were half shia in iraq .

  iranian muslim . 
  even pakistan is shia , as were the ba'ath in iraq . 
  the raj was brutal and evil , and needed to be brought down . 
  and it was . 
  i 've often regretted that dyer was never assassinated , ira style . 
  gandhi and his non-violence were a kindness churchill did n't deserve . 
  but i do recognize how much some did , and how sati and caste system reform started with brit help . 
  not to mention the genuine benevolence shown by multiple offers of atlee and mountbatten . 
  flag = solidarity . 
  anglosphere for life . 
  turns out hindus who have lost family to islamists are n't too fond of a murderous ideology . 
  but yes , feel free to attack my post history for a perfectly honest comment . 
  my grandparents and uncle did n't live in the 14th century . 
   i think a solution is to have education be non-free and fund it by cheap government loans which are folded if you work in denmark for a decade or so . 
   yup . 
  what i was thinking . 
  the eu court made it such that you ca n't create a burden only on foreign eu students , right ? 
  but if a requirement was added , that * all students receiving subsidies , regardless of citizenship , had to sign a contract to work in denmark post graduation , would that be legal ? 
  * it impacts everyone the same way , while incentivizing only denmark or denmark-desiring students from benefiting . 
   this is the perfect example for why the eu is unpopular . 
  the eu is just obsessed with ideology and very centrist and authoritarian it 's wealth redistribution . 
  now add in that many nations have different wealth levels , and quality of life varies greatly between different member countries , and you 're essentially robbing the rich member states . 
   yes , it makes sense that people can move to other countries but there is no rational reason why countries would n't be allowed to have at least some kind of caps once immigration is very high and unbalanced . 
  simpler question : does this sort of agreement help * both * parties ? 
  ** free movement helps the economically backward states while creating surplus labor competition in the richer ones -- exacerbating income inequality and forcing the poor of rich nations , who pay higher bills , to earn as much as the migrants from poorer ones . 
  **  the eu is basically ignoring that there are massive economic ( and cultural ) difference between eastern and western europe that 's not even the most serious divide the eu is ignoring . 
   but no , the eu has to insist on the most radical version ... 
  the eu is full of * indirectly * elected representatives . 
  each level of separation makes them less grounded , more elitist , and more concentrated in their views . 
  it 's an echo chamber which will naturally result in incronguence w.r.t the citizens . 
  btw , as an extremely pro-anglo indian , i 'd like to point out something / u/blablahfish did n't : the british deliberately enforced exports of raw materials and purchase of imported finished textiles and other goods so as to boost their current account surplus . 
  post-industrialisation unemployment had to be fought , and mercantilist policies were a part of that ( and other things ) . 
  fun bloke , napier : upon capturing sindh , napier sent back a simple telegram , * `` peccavi . 
  '' * latin for `` i have sinned . '', 
  as an indian , i think the british empire was a net positive . 
  colonialism had many sins , but to deny the improvement to human life it brought is asinine . 
  i urge all to compare the quality of life and liberty in french and british colonies , and realize the positive impact which an empire may effect . 
  sati ( widow burning ) and the caste system were being fought by reformers with the assistance of the raj before 1857 . 
  these aims were abandoned after the uprising ( supported by roughly half the nation ; large parts remaining loyal ) , but the ignition and acceleration enabled the spread of equality and human dignity . 
  you use streets collectively , each time you interact with or purchase any goods or service utilising them , not to mention via taxes on fuel and vehicles . 
  the grid 's paid for too , by your bills . 
  no point conversing with one who does n't know how the world functions or is just functionally illiterate . 
  good day . 
   i 'm not too idealistic about liberty and freedom but they are just artificial things created by man . 
  upon which a consistent society can exist . 
  axioms of a functional system . 
   they 're not natural at all . 
  they are . 
  they are that which you have in absence of another human harming you . 
   i prefer to use the best of both aspects from totalitarianism and freedom . 
  you 're naive or flat out dangerous . 
   a version similar to singapore . 
  a totalitarian society with no free speech , genuine self determination , freedom of association , equality before the law , worker rights , privacy protections or due process . 
  a nation with no protections for the accused , no appellate system and ** mandatory minimum death sentences for weed . 
  ** you 're insane . 
   healthcare shouldnt be a commodity , it should be a basic human right . 
  that is impossible unless you compel free people to produce or work on terms they do n't desire . 
  you have a right not to be deprived of life , liberty and property . 
  no one has a right to be awarded , as freebies , the toil of another . 
  healthcare is a commodity . 
  you are n't entitled to anyone else 's property or service . 
  to take rights from one to award to another favoured class is tyranny . 
  you clearly do n't value life , liberty and property rights . 
  then you attempt to use class based divisive rhetoric . 
  and now you 're being disingenuous . 
  if that is n't a recipe for totalitarian dictators , idk what is . 
  if you think a disregard for those who ca n't brave the rain to vote on a critical decision impacting generations is the same as being against women 's suffrage , you 're retarded . 
  if weather changes your commitment to a vote deciding the country 's future , you do n't deserve to vote . 
  you can set up special city only permits which enable london based industry . 
  or create an entire visa tier for a special sector . 
   no insurance company was forced to insure them . 
  obamacare changed that . 
  forcing private business to gamble on unhealthy cases is a violation of freedom of association and property rights .
