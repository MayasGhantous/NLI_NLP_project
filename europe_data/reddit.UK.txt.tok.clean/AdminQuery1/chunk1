giving up and using racism now . 
  this gimmick fell apart faster than you expected . 
  it still is a choice . 
  it has never stopped being a choice . 
  we 've simply decided to make it over the alternative . 
  northern ireland and wales definitely are , and regions of england and scotland depend on them , yeah . 
  i swear i 'm not doing this on purpose but those are still incredibly broad , vague topics . 
  let 's take immigration , for example . 
  eu immigration ( and in particular eastern eu immigration , which is the kind ukip tends to protest most loudly ) [ are a fraction of uk immigration , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_immigration_to_the_united_kingdom ) and westminster can deal with non-eea immigration as it pleases . 
  what powers are you concerned about that we do n't currently have ? 
  sovereignty is an intentionally vague banner that the ukip/out crowd have chosen . 
  what exactly are you referring to ? 
  oh no it 's a troll account . 
  i 'm trying to see what you 're offering to convince me of the out campaign 's merits and i 'm not seeing anything . 
  as opposed to now , when we have more than ever ? 
  which is also based on misinformation , because eu immigration to the uk ( and let 's be honest , when we 're talking about ukip we 're talking about * eastern * eu immigration to the uk ) [ is just a fraction of overall immigration . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_immigration_to_the_united_kingdom ), 
  so we 're taking a definite and immediate hit for the possible prospect of vaguely defined `` benefits '' somewhere down the line ? 
  what powers exactly do you think have been given away that will return ? 
  and moreso , how can these apparently nation-shaping powers - that were deemed insignificant enough to be made subject to brussels - be used for a `` bold and exciting , '' `` massive changeup '' ? 
   we 'd have political independence , but have to accept that nobody would bother listening to us about anything . 
  is it just me or is this really all the out campaign seems to offer ? 
  i mean i 've literally heard no good reason for voting out . 
  gettin ' in good n ' early with the logical british response every time this silly question rears it 's head . 
  cyrillic has an inexplicable way of making things look * extra * depressing . 
  cameron delivers . 
   i could . 
  we both know you ca n't mate . 
  it was a genuine fuck-up that you thought you would n't get called on , which you repeatedly tried to run from and even tried to deflect with by implying an irishman would n't understand , and now you 've learned the danger of where that road leads : having your mistakes spread out in large for you . 
  and , hopefully , having you look at some of the facts that blow apart your silly out stance . 
  but live in hope , eh ? 
  if you actually cared about that you 'd - you know - defend your post i 've been demanding you defend for an hour now . 
  but we both know you ca n't , do n't we ? 
  ah , friedman , / u/vigorous ' favourite pundit to quote ( and thus , of course , the kremlin 's ) . 
  that 's cool mate i 'll be right here holding your posts up like a badge of pride . 
  the date keeps getting pushed back every year . 
  how long until we 'll be celebrating the warmest summers since the hadean era ? 
  a big , happy cuddle-puddle ? 
  shut door , make happy . 
  and i say that as a liberal in most senses of the word . 
  it 's always the last place you look . 
  people need to stop this whole problem with differentiating between ** the putin administration ** and ** the nation of russia . 
  ** seriously people , despite what 's being spread around here ** one is not the other . 
  jesus from * the flu ? 
  sorry i do n't see a relation between what you 're saying and anything anyone anywhere is talking about . 
   the eu legislative process undermines the very foundations of our common law and our parliamentary sovereignty in a way which it does n't undermine the legal and consitutional systems of other eu countries . 
  i do n't think it helps the uk to be so compromised in this regard . 
  this is just vague scaremongering . 
   as a common law lawyer used to pragmatism and certainty of the english law legal system this ca n't have been said with a straight face , surely . 
  and losing a portion of north sea oil and requiring an incredibly costly and incredibly immediate rebuilding , rebasing and reharbouring of your nuclear deterrent . 
  so * you 're * arguing with an agenda . 
  [ all rise for our national anthem . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzyzvmcgwhg ), 
  putin ordered the murder of a british citizen . 
  that there has to be payback is n't really up for discussion . 
  you do n't murder our people if you value your lives . 
  elect jackasses , pretend to be surprised when they run the country into the ground :(, 
  it is - and has been throughout it 's history - crippled , stymied and forced into regressive stagnation by endemic , all-pervading corruption . 
  it never made the strides that the rest of europe made even in the era of the tzar , who was a throwback ruler of truly autocratic proportions even in the victorian era . 
  it has n't under putin , the latest in a long-line of sun kings . 
  and it wo n't under whoever comes next . 
  this is a real thing , in case anyone thinks he 's kidding . 
  poland please get rid of your government . 
  please . 
  saying something is n't reason because you do n't like it does n't make it unreasonable . 
  european coherence is critical in this . 
  so far the one unifying factor seems to be that we want things to change , and that there 's no appetite for more immigration chaos . 
  that points us towards solutions involving aid to closed-borders at the frontier states and no more immigrants . 
  i know , and it sucks that the western half seems too eager to pretend soviet rule had no lasting effect on not only the people of central and eastern europe , but on the politics of russia too , which has not moved on from 25 years ago . 
  the soviets were really just a different breed of nazi . 
  the poison they inflicted upon the world for so long was incredible . 
  that whole `` does n't admit members in conflict '' is actually 100 % not true . 
  i 've no idea where that silly rumour even got started . 
  this is the most i will ever care about your bigoted little opinion . 
   of course it is entirely possible that it is too late for us to join nato i seriously doubt you guys would * ever * be turned down , nevermind now . 
  do n't get me wrong , before the era of russia 's renewed aggression from 2008 - to today i was content with that . 
  but continuing as we have been with an amoral gangster-state just to our east makes no sense . 
  the moscow media talks like this to try and assert it 's actions as being those of a major power , of someone due the importance with it regards itself . 
  when in reality , of course , the kremlin 's opinions are less than irrelevant to finland , they 're probably pushing them the other way . 
  and predictably in their own thread the denizens of / r/russia are saying this poll is not trustworthy . 
  that 's a very carefully chosen metric to imply great investment where in fact there 's just been cut after cut . 
  look at the queen elizabeth class aircraft carrier for an off-the-cuff ; non-nuclear powered , non-catobar despite the damn things supposed to be `` future-proof , '' and the fleet size reduced from 3 down to 2 . 
   the point being , you seem to be under the impression that the plan to join the eu implied some sort of a remorseful attempt to change ourselves , to humbly plead for forgiveness of the eu public and it 's beurocrats , so you find it hard to believe . 
  ( `` to presume that vlad putin , the enemy incarnate , is turning to the light ? 
  unimaginable ! '' ), 
  we get it dude , you 're a troubled teen and the world 's a pile of shit . 
  step away from the razor blade and go outside . 
  sorry it 's hard to understand you when you 're not prefacing everything you do with tales about why you do n't have to do it because the us invaded vietnam . 
   hear , hear . 
  and the blind will receive sight , the lame will walk , and the deaf will hear . 
  thank you for the effort , i really appreciate that quote from the `` primer for eu boy scouts '' , but once again , if i was interested in a religious debate , i would go to church . 
  maybe you should 've spent less time in church and more time in the classroom . 
  every post-soviet state 's journey to ascension to the eu has involved meeting the [ copenhagen criteria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copenhagen_criteria ) which russia does n't and receive the assent of each member state , which russia would n't get . 
  but you do n't seem interested in reality so much as tabloid-spin . 
  yet another out voter who 's no loss to the rest of us . 
  do n't worry , the ukip supporters are already writing their posts up . 
  i mean i guess if *** i *** got nailed to the wall about using whataboutisms and all the other shit *** i *** did *** i 'd ** try and pretend people were misusing the term too . 
  but then i 'm not a smart person ,, 
  sorry i 'm just kind of sat here wondering how any of your kind ever get anything done when you 're constantly complaining that you do n't have to take out the garbage because bush invaded iraq . 
  you know the same way you try to excuse your country 's ( let 's not flairs kid each other ) rape and , let 's be honest , sheer incompetent mismanagement of central and eastern europe because several hundred years ago britain did a , let 's be honest , much better job of it .
