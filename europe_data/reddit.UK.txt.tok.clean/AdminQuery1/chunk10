  i 'll repeat my question to you : explain how the bigoted views of a billionaire are the proper function of the mechanism of a democratic government . 
  take all the time you need . 
  be here , confidently waiting . 
  generally the one making the arguement brings the evidence , jackass . 
  so bring me that evidence . 
  sure it is . 
  and now , bereft of an arguement , he tries an ad hominem . 
  `` american english '', 
  like , * literally * . 
  he sacked cities , beheaded populations , fucked underage girls , the whole lot . 
  but allah told him to do it so , you know . 
  he gets a pass . 
  we have plenty of ideas what they believe , because here is no shortage of data *** on precisely what we are talking about . 
  *** i know turning the other cheek always * feels * like the right thing to do , but there 's a point where that philosophy falls incredibly short . 
  yes . 
  your alt . 
  many people agree with kim jong un and robert mugabe . 
  does that make them right ? 
  does that mean we should base our policies on robert mugabe 's ? 
  why do you believe that ? 
  at what point did you decide bigotry was what you stood for ? 
  that you were for apartheid and state sponsored ethnic cleansing ? 
  i attack trump because he 's a bigot and populist with bad policies . 
  i attack you because you do n't have the courage to venture your own opinion even on he internet , even on an alt account . 
  give me a reason to waste my energy on you , why do n't you ? 
  both of those times had several competing superpowers . 
  and both those times led to massive , bloody conflicts . 
  haha , do n't worry , he been long since banned to the outskirts of reddit . 
  would you rather i respond to you or your alt ? 
  oh heck , ill do both . 
  if you can explain to me how the bigoted opinions of a billionaire charlatan represent the proper flow of the democratic system , i 'll happily resign me citizenship and move to tijuana . 
  that 's not an ad hominem . 
  i appreciate that you felt so intimidated by me that you jumped on your days-old alt to defend yourself . 
  god , you just know this sounded so cool in his mind . 
  i 've literally heard nobody talk about this apart from / u/vigorous , and he 's been banned for a year . 
  always remember to emasculate yourself when there 's a choice between making a change and not . 
  that 's why it 's been so hard for europe to federalize . 
  `` well yeah they 're gon na fuck us , but we 're sorta okay for now and we 'll probably be fine if we just do n't bother anyone with our opinions . '', 
  you 'd make a poor politician but a very good puppet . 
  because this is n't about trade , this is about the ccp 's projection of power . 
   chinese state media has predicted britain will afford an `` ultra-royal welcome '' to xi , who last set foot in the uk in 1994 when he was an official in the south-eastern city of fuzhou . 
   a frontpage story in the china daily boasted that xi 's arrival would be celebrated with a 103-gun salute -- 41 in green park and 62 at the tower of london . 
  it 's the feeling of bending over that does it . 
  we fucking * know * this is only going to end one way . 
  if the prc was n't a systemically corrupt single-party state where the 2-million strong military serves the * party * ( not the state ) with endless issues of bribery , corruption , human rights abuses and the mistreatment of minorities i 'd be a lot less concerned . 
  this is beijing 's attempt to see if they can turn us into the port of piraeus . 
  that 's a weird stance to hang your hat on . 
  i 'm not big on one-word replies either but removing them all is going to make you a very busy and frustrated mod . 
  yeah i 'm sure china totally rates the uk as an equal trading partner . 
  that 's why they had the fucking balls to * warn * us not to bring up their abysmal fucking human rights records . 
   according to trump lem me just stop you right there . 
  hungary is n't criticized for defending it 's borders . 
  it 's getting criticized for the diplomatic and ( in my mind much more unfairly ) humanitarian message it is sending by building the fence and the us is routinely lambasted both north and south of the border for how it handles border controls with mexico . 
  for fuck 's sake virtually every gangster movie involving a mexican deals with it . 
  most people have no idea ceuta and melilla exist . 
  they literally never come up in international news , ever . 
  i was going to bring up gibraltar as an example , but it 's probably much better known . 
  so instead of representing the people she 's supposed to and taking a firmer stance on immigration she tries to deflect by bringing up go-nowhere accession talks with erdogan ? 
  fuck off , will you !, 
   the fire was attended by 20 firefighters . 
  the building , part of the otherwise demolished furulidsskolan , was to be prepared to greet asylum seekers in the affluent area of kungsbacka . 
  wait , so it was * supposed * to host refugees in a snooty , upper-class town south of gothenburg and it just * happens * to be the third to burn down in a week ? 
  come the fuck on . 
  if it 's before they offend , does n't that make them praedophiles ? 
  ta very much . 
  yeah , that 's how i heard it when i clicked the link on the wiki . 
  i was n't dissing polish or anything , i just wondered if there was a story behind why it was written different to how it was pronounced in english . 
  i guess you 're still taking your time on this one . 
  why ? 
  is wroclaw one of those polish cities that sounds nothing like it 's spelled in english ? 
  do n't tell me how to hate myself . 
   indeed , the fact that joes son sits on board of directors of ua gas company with fields in eastern ukraine and is entitled to his million dollar bonus check for his incredible hard work , is absolutely unrelated you did n't do so well in law school , did you . 
  it has * always * been called the [ lockerbie bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan_am_flight_103 ) . 
   fuck bbc and its `` unbiased '' reporting ... 
  this is what unbiased reporting is : * not * jumping to conclusions . 
  [ meanwhile , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/3ojxcz/ukrainians_have_created_an_arabiclanguage_website/ ) in / r/russia :  ukrainians suffering multi-butthurts . 
  what a retards for real . 
   we should save what 's possible and let the rest run to europe , few millions of whites can help the eu to hold their color . 
  / trollface 9-year user , by the way . 
  and entirely indicative of / r/russia 's attitude towards ukraine and ukrainians for over a year and a half now . 
  and this is why we can all sleep better at night knowing , at the end of the day , nobody takes the shit anyone says on here seriously . 
  you do n't speak for `` us '' and you should n't pretend that you do . 
  i 'd rather continue fostering trade , human rights , integration of european states into a greater body , citizen travel and general closeness and integration between european states and peoples than , you know , * not * do that . 
  hold on , i 'll drag a one-legged hobo from the gutter to talk to you as soon as he 's done pissing on himself . 
  i 've never heard a compelling arguement for changing the status quo , and that reductionism definitely is n't it . 
  i 'll be voting to stay in the eu . 
  every arguement i 've heard to the contrary always sounds like the most petty , short-sighted nonsense to me . 
  yeah that 's a confusing one . 
  you 're cherry-picking your points based on your own views and nothing more . 
  aaaand there goes an half hour of my life , thanks . 
  visit beautiful * silent hill . 
  the only housing development constructed entirely from pixels . 
  so like , * outside * of london ? 
  i do n't understand . 
   i am out of the loop and not really understanding this deal welcome to *** fucking everybody , *** and i 'm * certain * that 's entirely intentional at this point . 
  grumble ^ grumble ^ ^ mumble, 
  no tulips either . 
  could n't you like , hollow another pair out of a tree ? 
  or however you make clogs . 
  you do n't think that 's beyond the pale , is what i 'm saying ?
