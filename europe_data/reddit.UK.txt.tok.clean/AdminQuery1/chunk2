  but i mean who needs efficiency or accountability when you can drink yourself to an early grave , right ? 
  oh look a whataboutism what a shocker now tell us how we ca n't trust any brand of media because they 're all corrupt, 
  thanks to my profound mastery of this archaic language i 'm also able to infer when people are n't talking literally . 
  you took his statement as literal as opposed to the institution of the kremlin , and because you 're * you * and this is what you do , you decided to whine about it . 
  well , agincourt would 've looked a bit different in that case . 
  so when you hear the kremlin is doing this to protect their past you think this means the literal people in office at that time ? 
  as opposed to the institution of the kremlin ? 
   aside from the troops , britain will also station a ship on the baltic sea to support the polish fleet , macierewicz said . 
   warsaw and london have also agreed to form a joint `` situational awareness '' unit , tasked with gathering information on any potential threats to nato 's eastern flank , he said . 
  good . 
  i 'd like to think the sudden sea-change in permanently stationing troops is at least in part a reaction to the ongoing litvinenko thing , but that 's probably just me being optimistic . 
  we need to expand our military first , instead of making endless cuts to it to the point where it 's a laughing stock . 
  well , looks like * someone 's * shadowbanned . 
   i was arguing against / u/imtoki 's position that this was because people in kremlin did that to protect their past . 
  this is demonstrably false . 
  generally when you say that you have to demonstrate how it 's false . 
  sure you can . 
  and in the world of emerging superpowers the uk continues the slide into irrelevancy because somebody thought they could get an extra 2 % from washington . 
  thanks for jumping on your alt to attack me . 
  yeah i knew you were n't being serious , i was just looking for an excuse to post that link . 
  i 'm not arguing that it 's wrong , i 'm flat-out calling you a liar . 
  it 's not a paper about `` litvinenko 's deception , '' it 's a paper about how your incompetent gangster government has predictably ruined british-russian relations by being an anachronistic cold-war era murderer . 
  but to know that you 'd have to have actually read the fucking paper , would n't you ? 
  but the eastern europeans are [ such a small portion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_immigration_to_the_united_kingdom ) of the immigrant community . 
  did dropping the words nixon next to `` conspiracy theory '' give you a such a bad stroke you thought that you could spin that paper on russia 's shitbird relationship with the uk into being about `` litvinenko 's deception ? '', 
  like are you just physically * made * of bullshit by this point ? 
  i came into this discussion with low aspirations and you managed to disappoint even that . 
  conspiracy theories from fringe websites and out of thin air . 
  no wonder the only place you post is / r/russia . 
  just do n't feel compelled to inflict yourself on us in future . 
   well for starters he , like many members of security forces in russia during the 90s , worked for berezovsky ( by berezovsky 's own admission postmortem ) . 
  if you are n't aware , berezovsky was one of the key oligarchs in russia during the wild 90s , and had a huge hand in manipulating public opinion via all the media he controlled back then . 
  in order to protect the status-quo and keep the state money flowing into his and other oligarchs ' pockets , he propped up the incompetent drunk that was yeltsin through every major crisis ( including the chechen war , the constitutional crisis where yeltsin shelled his own fucking parliament , and through the fraudulent election that bought him his 2nd term ) . 
  none of this has anything to do with litvinenko . 
   litvinienko was one his guys in the fsb \\ the guy who uncovered the fucking hit on him ? 
  the guy with the [ only thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_litvinenko ) tying him to [ berezovsky , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_berezovsky_ ( businessman ) ) is that they worked for the same organization and putin hates both of them ? 
   litvinienko was one his guys in the fsb , and in exchange for his services he was behind his promotions . 
  after yeltsin 's resignation and putin 's assumption of the presidency , berezovsky realized he had miscalculated the technocrat that he took a part in assigning the pm post , thinking he was going to be a pushover and friendly like his predecessor . 
  this is entirely your own fiction . 
   to attack putin , citing `` anti-democratic rule '' , a hilarious pretext you 've * got * to be joking . 
   this was incredibly shortsighted , as the government then proceeded to strip them of the power they gained in the 90s as much as possible . 
  berezovsky and guzinsky lost their media properties and de-facto exiled to the uk , khodorkovsky was imprisoned after yukos lost the protection it had in the 90s . 
  litvinenko logically went with his employer hold on , you 've *** entirely skipped the entire reason putin had litvinenko arrested twice : he was the one who uncovered the kremlin 's plans to murder berezovsky . 
  *** what the fuck ? 
  he was arrested once , acquitted , arrested again and then fled . 
  boris was probably just as much of a scumbag as putin is , but you ca n't just fucking paper-over plans by the government to * murder * it 's own fucking people . 
   litvinenko logically went with his employer , and to make an extra buck also gave himself to mi6 . 
  he applied for asylum in london [ because he could n't get refuge in the us embassy in turkey . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_litvinenko#flight_from_russia_and_asylum_in_the_united_kingdom )  now the british are obviously going to use the lines along `` he was investigating corruption '' ( already paradoxical considering his affiliation with berezovsky ) , his non-existent affiliation ? 
   but in reality he was most likely just giving out the state secrets that he knew while in the fsb . 
  the * entire reason * he could n't get refuge with the us was because he * did n't * know state-secrets worth anyone 's time , because he was a damn anti-corruption officer , not a spy . 
  for goodness sake [ mi6 waited 2 years before even bothering to contact him , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_litvinenko#cooperation_with_mi6 ) and then used him to combat russian organized crime in europe . 
   for the next several years , berezovsky would continue to attempt to influence public opinion in russia , and used primarily the handomely payed litvinienko and goldfarb to be his mouthpieces . 
  there 's supposed to be something sinister about an anti-corruption officer who was run out of his country by his corrupt government speaking out against that very corrupt government ? 
  i 'm not even going to bother dealing with the ties with berezovsky , particularly considering by most accounts he helped putin assume his position , [ and putin 's own * immense * corruption is what prompted this *** entire shitshow . 
  *** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_litvinenko#claims_against_fsb_leadership ), 
  because you do n't fucking know it . 
  you allow a system of intense corruption to continue because you 're a fucking part of it . 
  do you think any of this is privileged information ? 
  do you think anything - *** anything *** - you know is n't public knowledge , readily available to anyone with even the smallest urge to look it up ? 
  do you think your ignorances are worth more because you were * raised * in that country ? 
  fucking everything about living in russia , from the price of milk to the struggle to find work to the state of the media to the state of the fucking * bribes * you pay toll both operates * have been open knowledge * for . 
  years . 
  because * russians * fucking told us , and non-russians told us more . 
  get your privileged i 'm - special prejudice out of this fucking forum and separate your identity from that of your dictator for fuck 's sake , you 're supposed to be a grown fucking adult !, 
  i do n't know , you have n't told me yet . 
  this is me not giving a shit about a throwaway account pretending to be british . 
  this is me not giving a shit about a throwaway account pretending to be british . 
  do you / r/russia types ever get tired of using that excuse when your own prejudices and shortcomings illuminate just how flawed your own understandings of your own government 's dealings are ? 
  of course it will , do n't bother feeding the bizarre out trolls . 
  what 's it like being a walking stereotype ? 
  oh it 's just evans-pritchard at it again . 
   ( different guy ) perhaps not but the current eu policy does encourage both migrants and people smugglers . 
  the upcoming unlimited admittance and quota plan will do so even more strongly . 
  leave or remain the eu handing of the migrant influx has been absolutely terrible . 
  the quota plan has not been agreed upon for implementation and still sets the ceiling very low . 
   north america 2 countries ? 
  because if you 're legitimately including * norther america * in that , which is to say everywhere north of colombia , that 's simply not true . 
   he said that it does n't matter if ukip are nationalist that does n't make every ` out ' proponent a rabid nationalist no it does n't , but it also does n't change the fact that ukip and this campaign are coasting on an undercurrent of bigotry , and expecting people to politely ignore that is both intellectually dishonest and just flat-out ludicrous . 
   `` the city '' it not a gestalt entity the [ city of london ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_of_london ) very much * is * an entity with it 's own form and shape and protected by and accounted for with it 's own set of laws and governance and it 's own voices and powers to influence it 's opinions , which are - as are often reported and which i 've allowed myself to repeat yet again - predominantly pro-eu . 
  this is n't going to change any time soon . 
  the moderator of / r/russia , everybody . 
  go on then , let us know why . 
  i 'm sure this 'll be impartial and well-substantiated . 
   no , the eu is not being helpful in relation to refugees . 
  currently the policy of the eu in relation to refugees encourages people smuggling , dangerous journeys and people to walk across multiple countries . 
  fortunately the uk is opting out of this . 
  if you are voting out because you support doing * more * for refugees you are literally the first person to ever declare doing so . 
   you originally asserted that europe is the most profitable place in the world . 
  your links are nothing to do with that . 
  separately , the question is about eu membership . 
  you ca n't refute the argument , so just concede it instead of engaging in these little tantrums . 
   ukip 's electoral platform was not a nationalist one . 
  even if it were , this would not mean that wanting to leave the eu is nationalist . 
  that was some quick back-pedalling !, 
  again i 'll repeat - if you honestly expect people not to address ukip and their supporters ulterior and bigoted motives for sponsoring the out campaign you 're going to be repeatedly very surprised . 
  i 'm done addressing your ludicrously self-delusion pleas to hear that the city is anything but pro-eu . 
  move on . 
  i 'm not here to convince you , i want to hear any sound reason at all from you for why we should leave a very beneficial union . 
  i 'm currently one of the majority completely unconvinced by the vague notions of the out campaign .
