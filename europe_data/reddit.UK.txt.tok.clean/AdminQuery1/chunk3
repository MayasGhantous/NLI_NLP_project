   democracy - one of my main reasons to fall into the leave camp is my preference for the democratic governing of this country to be done in this country as far as is possible . 
  in addition to this i fail to see how the population of the uk is in anyway involved in eu politics or ever will be in the future . 
  aside from the fact that westminster still governs the uk unless you 've been told some secret news the rest of us have n't , this is reductionist and self-defeating logic . 
  by these terms scotland would have seceded last year . 
  besides that your sentence about the uk not being involved in the eu are your private politics . 
  i say we are involved and history , current trade deals , diplomacy and , well , * everything * backs that up , so ... yeah . 
   immigration - regardless of current immigration and what exactly can be done or not done in the immediate future is not my primary concern . 
  however the current situation does inform me with regards to the future . 
  when i consider this i can only wish to vote out as my faith in the eu 's ability to handle such an issue is zero , combined with the fact there looks to be very little movement to combat global warming current migrations are likely to be a drop in the ocean . 
  the uk has complete control over non-eea nationals . 
  of the top 5 countries feeding immigrants to the uk only one is from the eu ( poland ) and it is behind china , pakistan , the us and australia . 
  how immigration ever became a platform for this campaign is beyond me . 
  the numbers simply do n't signify any impact . 
  and what 's this about global warming ? 
   eurozone - if the uk had joined the euro then i believe we would already consider our position to be irreversible . 
  however this is not currently the case and there seems ( to me ) to be no appetite for the uk to join the euro . 
  therefore again i struggle to see a reason we should wish to be part of a political union that is increasingly moving towards closer union centered on a single currency . 
  there have been zero calls from anyone for the uk or any other opt-out state to join the euro . 
  the echr is a body of the coe but the coe is powerless to enforce it , hence the eu 's role in practice . 
   there is no point talking about europe because europe and the eu are not the same thing . 
  the uk is n't leaving europe because it evidently ca n't leave a geographical and historical reality . 
  the question is over whether or not we leave the eu . 
  it can however leave the modern institutions which help that region maintain that reality , which is what you and your crowd are advocating on vaguely alluded to grounds of `` sovereignty '' and `` refugees , '' flying in the face of both major business and human rights interests . 
   given that you were the one who made the initial claims , the onus is on you to provide sources . 
  so you do n't have any and do n't know how to rebut , why am i not surprised . 
  [ so here 's me ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita ) [ doing your homework for you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) ) [ providing you a list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita ) [ on how europe is economically ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_hour_worked ) [ and in ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_freedom_indices#/media/file:2015_freedom_house_world_map.png ) [ many other ways ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) [ the most successful ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index ) [ region on ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country ) [ the planet . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index )  ukip are not ultranationalists . 
  even if they were ultranationalists , it is a failure of logic to say that someone who supports the same cause as them is a nationalist . 
  you are simply trying to shut down the debate . 
  just as norwegians who do n't want to join the eu are not nationalists , brits who want the uk to leave the eu are not nationalists . 
  it 's quite something to defend ukip and claim nationalism and bigotry are n't part of the agenda . 
  to argue that the out campaign are n't being at all dishonest is some quite impressive and illuminating gall on your part , actually . 
   i work in the city . 
  it is not `` pro-eu '' . 
  the city as a global financial centre will flourish outside the eu just like the other global financial centres like hong kong , new york and singapore , all of which use the english language and the anglo-saxon common law . 
  i 'm just going to repeat myself as you 've brought nothing new here and what you are saying is personal politics flying in the face of oft-reported reality :  the city is pro-eu . 
  you can bank on it being otherwise , but it would be an unwise gamble . 
  edit : dear lord do i hate how linking works on this site . 
  what is the issue ? 
  what is the reason that ukip and their out chums are proposing that we leave the eu and all the benefits it brings ? 
  so your reason for the debate is the debate itself . 
  wonderful . 
  i 'm not sure how else to respond to someone who acts like he 's on a playground and attempts to repeat my statement back at me in a mocking fashion . 
   europe is not the profitable region in the world . 
  usa and canada are more profitable . 
  europe is not politically transparent , lobbyists dominate the eu lesislative process . 
  the eu does not have the highest standards of living , switzerland has a higher standard of living and is outside the eu . 
  i 'll overlook you playing fast and loose with definitions when i simply said `` europe '' and ask you for sources on all of these , and then i 'll ask you how any of those will be ameliorated for us by leaving the bodies of the eu which have thus far been economically , politically and from a simple quality of life standpoint extremely beneficial for us . 
   stop calling me a nationalist , whatever you mean by that . 
  it is an attempt to shut down the debate . 
  wanting the uk to leave the eu is no more nationalistic than norwegians or icelanders who want to keep out of the eu . 
  this is absurd . 
  your cause is championed by ukip , the most ultranationalist party the uk has whose most famous refrain is `` we are not bigots . '', 
  have some sense of self-awareness and good grace . 
   the city is divided on the eu . 
  there are city insitutions funding both sides of debate . 
  the city is pro-eu . 
  you can bank on it being otherwise , but it would be an unwise gamble . 
  except that they 're not , of course . 
  europe remains the most profitable , peaceful , judicially accountable , politically transparent region on earth with the highest standard of living and trading . 
  you 're advocating the fever dream of short-sighted nationalists for their own short-term benefit to the detriment of the rest of us immediately and the country itself in the long term . 
  and linking mr weber 's personal views when the article takes pains to explicitly state that they fly in the face of the city of london as a whole which is `` widely seen as pro-eu '' is * extremely * dishonest of you , especially when the best he can do to assuage fears is say that there will merely be `` three to four years of heightened uncertainty . '', 
   do not worry i was not going to apologize for your in ability to be reasonable . 
  what a sheltered live you must have lead . 
   who knows you may calm down before the vote and think about the issue . 
  allright , let 's hear the issue . 
  it 's cool , you do n't have to apologize . 
  just substantiate your argument for once instead of , you know , not doing that . 
   the city will benefit from being outside the eu . 
  that must be why all the major banks are backing the in campaign and saying `` we want to remain in the european union . '', 
  there 's no reason to leave . 
  no it 's me flat-out mocking you for your lack of substance . 
  * ( takes part of what i say and nonsensically repeats it back to me ) * * ( makes accusation that i am being immature ) * - an out voter . 
  if you want to cut off your nose to intentionally damage the city that 's your business , but it 's the single most important entity in the british economy . 
   it 's a hard question for sure . 
  maybe uk is better off with the commonwealth + usa . 
  we 've got those anyway . 
  there 's absolutely nothing to gain from leaving the eu . 
  it 's intrinsically tied to and enforced by the eu . 
  trying to frame the two as separate is at best dishonest . 
  so then leave the out campaign . 
  the human rights act is subservient to the echr . 
  you 're 14 years old because you support the murder of an anti-corruption officer who was at the time of his murder a british citizen by his corrupt russian superiors with the argument of `` he was talking shit . '', 
  the eu is a massively beneficial organization for us to be a part of economically , politically , diplomatically and as far as human rights and judicial options for the citizens of the uk are concerned it 's an enormous boon . 
  the checks on state abuses through organs like the european court of human rights are immensely important . 
  a vague allusion to `` other countries surviving '' outside is not exactly compelling reason to give these benefits up . 
   wanting the uk to leave the eu is not nationalist paranoia any more than norwegians and swiss wanting to stay out of the eu is nationalist paranoia . 
  it is about returning democracy to our own democratic institutions and making our politicians more accountable to our electorate . 
  calling it nationalist paranoia is simply a demostration that you want to shut down the discussion . 
  i 'm curious to how poor your understanding of the uk political structure is where you think the eu is at all damaging it , or perhaps you think this is an us election and you can just repeat the word `` democracy '' again and again , but when i see people outright lie about border controls , european immigration to the uk and the uk 's ability to deal with non-eea nationals i tend to think these people have agendas they are n't telling us about . 
  i 'll take your word for that , i 'm just talking about their apologists for murder of british citizens . 
  of course it 's not a criminal offense , but he was still jailed for doing it because he was an ant-corruption officer and - and this is going to shock you - russia in the late 90s was incredibly corrupt . 
  and while lugovoy may not have been 14 when he killed litvenenko , that certainly seems to be the crowd he pulls his supporters from when they defend murdering british citizens for `` talking shit . '', 
  and then there 's the majority of us who do n't want our jobs , private lives and business ties to suffer purely to satisfy the nationalist paranoia of a short-sighted minority . 
  that 's exactly what it is . 
  but because 140 million people defend it we 're supposed to say it 's not so ? 
  well , it and every other major corporation and banking firm . 
  and anyone with a lick of sense :  `` this is a once-in-a-generation moment and the stakes are high , '' cameron is expected to say . 
  `` if you want a more competitive europe , where the single market is completed , where there are more trade deals and fewer regulations : join me in making that case . 
   `` if you believe , like i do , that britain is better off in a reformed european union , then , when the time comes , help me make that case for britain to stay . '',
