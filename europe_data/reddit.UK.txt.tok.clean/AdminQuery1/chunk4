  he was an anti-corruption officer who was jailed and murdered for literally doing his job . 
  i suppose i do n't understand how `` talking shit '' is grounds for murder of british citizens because i 'm not a 14 year old russian ? 
   he was a part of the russian intelligence/security service . 
  it 's not his job to go around talking shit and writing books . 
  it does n't even matter if it 's true or not . 
  he was an anti-corruption officer . 
  that was literally his job . 
  more than that he was a british citizen . 
   there is nothing to apologize for . 
  is it illegal ? 
  yeah . 
  do i support fully ? 
  absolutely you should probably look up what apologist means , because you are doing it . 
  i mean that was my understanding . 
  he exposed russian corruption , was unjustly jailed for it , let go , then unjustly jailed again , fled to london , exposed more corruption , and was murdered . 
  yet to / u/9a4172 this is properly grounds for execution . 
  the mind boggles . 
  of course not , what do i look like , a russian spy reading his mission brief ? 
  we should be making a fucking concerted effort to effect the flow of refugees and migrants already . 
  hearing some random person from central or south-east europe go off about this every other week is getting tiresome . 
  but why . 
  well if nobody wants to change , guess what happens ? 
  i think that 's his point . 
  master or apprentice ? 
  i 'm not exactly sure how criticising the kremlin and being a consultant on russian organized crime after being jailed by corrupt superiors for * doing his job * is viewed as grounds for assassination , but then i 'm not an apologist . 
  you should probably look up what apologism actually means . 
  this case disgusted me from the start . 
  the outright murder of a british citizen by russian assassins on our soil leaves a nasty sting , particularly with the knowledge that it was personally okayed by a smug gangster like putin . 
  quite hypocritally , i hope there were lots of little acts of paybacks in the shadow for this . 
  i do n't want gangsters thinking they can kill our people for free . 
   during his time in london , litvinenko wrote two books , blowing up russia : terror from within and lubyanka criminal group , wherein he accused the russian secret services of staging the russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts in an effort to bring vladimir putin to power . 
  he also accused putin of ordering the murder in october 2006 of the russian journalist anna politkovskaya . 
  what are these books ? 
   blowing up russia : terror from within ( russian : \u0424\u0421\u0411 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e ) is a book written by alexander litvinenko and yuri felshtinsky . 
  [ 1 ] the authors have described the russian apartment bombings as a false flag operation that was guided by the russian federal security service to justify the second chechen war and bring vladimir putin to power . 
  the original russian language book was published in 2002 . 
  [ 2 ]  lubyanka criminal group ( also translated as the gang from lubyanka ) is a book by alexander litvinenko about the alleged transformation of the russian security services into a criminal and terrorist organization . 
   alexander valterovich litvinenko ( russian : \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0412\u0430\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0301\u043d\u043a\u043e ; ipa : [ \u0250l\u02b2\u026a\u02c8ksandr \u02c8valt\u0259r\u0259v\u02b2\u026at\u0255 l\u02b2\u026atv\u02b2\u026a\u02c8n\u02b2\u025bnk\u0259 ] ; 30 august 1962 [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 december 1962 by father 's account ] [ 4 ] -- 23 november 2006 ) was a former officer of the russian fsb secret service , who specialised in tackling organised crime . 
  [ 1 ] [ 5 ] in november 1998 , litvinenko and several other fsb officers publicly accused their superiors of ordering the assassination of the russian tycoon and oligarch boris berezovsky . 
  litvinenko was arrested the following march on charges of exceeding the authority of his position . 
  he was acquitted in november 1999 but re-arrested before the charges were again dismissed in 2000 . 
  he fled with his family to london and was granted asylum in the united kingdom , where he worked as a journalist , writer and consultant for the british intelligence services . 
  ah yes , clearly a scoundrel . 
  he was an anti-corruption operative that was repeatedly jailed by his corrupt superiors and fled to his family in london . 
  so that 's a no , then . 
  that 's ... incredible . 
  what would france and germany lose by backing this capital union , and would n't it go hand-in-hand with a currency union anyway ? 
  i was n't speaking about you personally , for goodness sake . 
  that is what 's required to convince you . 
  it has no bearing on whether the argument is strongly made ( ie not weak ) , and full of detail ( ie not vague ) . 
  that is * precisely * what determines whether it is weak and vague , and i 've rather made up my mind about your ability to convey it . 
   i do n't want to be drawn into this , as i am not making the arguments . 
  i am saying that there exist arguments that are not weak , and not vague . 
  there is an wealth of studies , articles , opinion pieces etc on the subject . 
  this is precisely the nonsense politicking that has made me grow so weary of the out campaign . 
  it 's a constant self-satisfied stream of `` oh yes , there are very good reasons , trust us ! '', 
  no , sorry , i do n't . 
  convince me of the merits of your argument or stay out of the politic arena . 
  if you 've got a respectable , intelligent reason for leaving the eu , i 'd very much like to hear it , because i 've heard nothing of the sort so far . 
   you do n't need to find them compelling , or to agree with them , to recognize that ( some ) arguments on those matters are neither weak nor vague . 
  no , if you want me to vote to leave the eu , which makes sense to me to be a part of , i definitely need to find your argument compelling , and you telling me that i do n't makes me nervous . 
  i 'm also watching you move about this thread , and you 've repeatedly said these arguments are n't `` weak or vague '' without even once mentioning what they are . 
   edit : how they can be seen is vague is beyond me . 
  there 's reams of text on this , in the media and on reddit , and elsewhere . 
  it 's being talked about to death . 
  i ca n't only assume that they 're vague to people who have n't properly read them . 
  okay , what are they then ? 
  tell me what the reasons as you , someone who says they * are n't * vague , sees them as . 
  i 've yet to hear a compelling argument for tempting any of these fantasies over the current status quo . 
  he 's not arguing for leaving the eu . 
   you do realise that the main reason that the british army was deployed in ni was to protect the catholic communities after they were assaulted during the 1969 riots . 
  that was the reason given for the deployment , and it precipitated decades of abuse by that very body on the people they were supposed to protect . 
   in fact the british army seeked to disarm the ruc and disband the usc . 
  okay you are just going down the wiki article now . 
  you have just attempted to argue that * bringing the army in to replace the police force * was a positive move by westminster . 
   you must realise ( though you seem incapable of subjective thought ) you mean objective thought . 
  you 're a teenager , are n't you ? 
   that these attacks on the public and the military would have only made it harder for progress to have been made . 
  the point of the attacks was because there was no peace process and no mechanism for one . 
  the reason for the continuation of the attacks was because the moves that were made did n't satisfy either the unionists ( who continued to murder catholic citizens this entire time ) or nationalists . 
   i never said that they did n't send them in , this makes no sense in regards to the passage of mind you quoted . 
  the truth is that the ira failed to unite ireland under republic control and their campaign of violence and terror discouraged the british from solving a problem that that could have been tackled within under a decade . 
  the goal of the ira was not to unite ireland . 
  it did n't have this power . 
  it was n't an arm of either government . 
  the british government had decades to `` solve the problem '' before the troubles began . 
  guess what ? 
  it did n't care . 
  guess what happened for years of the troubles ? 
  it still did n't care . 
  stop taking your political history from half-remembered hollywood films and a rush-reading of the wikipedia article . 
   the ira are n't heroes they were misguided and they certainly did n't win in any sane meaning of the word . 
  they were terrorists and freedom fighters . 
  they delivered on everything they wanted . 
  the nationalists got fair representation on every level that had been denied to them before , from politics to housing to jobs to the judiciary to the police force to the mass media to the medical profession . 
  you do n't understand the significance of this , that 's your own failing . 
  you were conditioned by the media that the ira were bad , and you do n't like hearing that these bad people achieved their goals . 
  that 's all this is . 
   you seem to only care about the years directly leading up to the good friday agreement . 
  i and the other guy literally went on at length to you about how london had decades to act on this before the troubles began and did n't .
