   btw . 
  still waiting for that answer on why they would do that instead of cutting regulations for their own internal markets while making them stricter when dealing with those outside their borders . 
  waiting from me for an argument why the eu would n't liberalise its internal market whilst being more protectionist globally ? 
  or that the uk would liberalise internally but the city of london would become more protectionist ? 
  both are equally strange , to be fair . 
  if the eu wants to become more protectionist then that is up to them . 
  and all the more reason why the future for the city lies outside the eu . 
  if why london would n't become more protectionist , then that 's because it bucks the exact trend that has meant london being a premier finance city when other eu countries are n't even represented in the top 10 , and badly represented in the top 30 . 
  if the other eu financial cities ca n't compete on a level playing field , god help them when a conservative government are n't limited by eu financial directives !, 
   the uk had so many exemptions in place already , exactly . 
  cherry picking evidently already existed , and not just for the uk either . 
   you got even more in february , but that was sold to the people as being nothing at all . 
  first of all , it did add up to nothing but a hill of beans so there was no real need for selling it as such . 
  this was laid testimony to by the fact that nearly no-one from the remain campaign even tried to champion the renegotiation in the official three months of campaigning . 
  and secondly , that was part and parcel of the problem of the nature of the renegotiation . 
  it should have never been a renegotiation for the uk , but a fundamental reform of the entire eu for the eu - including treaty change . 
  it should have been about addressing eurosceptic concerns felt in other countries too . 
   if you take any of the pillars away it is no longer a single market . 
  then do n't take them away for the members !, 
  i 'll try saying it again . 
  it 's not about the uk being a member of the single market but having access to , very different things , and something which other countries have in varying degrees . 
  the top three trading partners of the eu all have access to the single market without being members of it . 
  access to parts of , not a member to , the single market . 
  important distinction . 
   i 'm sorry mr. mcdonnell , but it has been made very clear by now , europe is not a project where you just cherry-pick and take only the things you like . 
  i should n't worry about mr. mcdonnell too much , he 's hardly driving the national narrative on this . 
  but let 's just revisit this you ca n't cherry pick , or there is no a la carte to the european union . 
  if you do n't want to be in the schengen , a nation does n't have to be in schengen . 
  if a country at the time did n't want to sign the fiscal compact , it did n't have to sign the fiscal compact . 
  if you do overspend deficit/gdp the compact ratio , having signed not to , then rule that you 're not paying fines . 
  when croatia was allowed to join it was without completing all chapters . 
  when greece was allowed to join the euro they were allowed to revalue to undervalue their debt . 
  if a country at the time did n't want to join the euro it did n't have to , and even if following countries were obliged they 're been allowed to catapult in perpetuity into the long grass ( it 's not a critique , poland , sweden , you did the right thing ) . 
  you do n't have to be in single market to be in the eu battlegroups . 
  you do n't have to be in the eu to have access to horizon2020 . 
  you do n't have to be in the single market to have access to erasmus + . 
  you do n't have to be in the eu ( or efta/eea ) to be in the european mediterranean free trade area . 
  you do n't have to be in the single market to have a free trade deal with the regards to goods and services . 
  --------------- all these have their own examples of how they have been cherry-picked . 
  how exactly is cherry-picking not already a thing ? 
  this `` cherry-picking '' and `` access to '' but not a member of , collectively has a name . 
  they 're called association agreements or partnerships . 
  they can contain free trade deals , as israel 's does . 
  * moldova * has been able to negotiate its own moldovan shaped association agreement . 
  it came into force today . 
  it has already been reported in the german press , and accordingly uk press , that the german finance ministry has already begun work on one . 
  common market . 
  thatcher was n't around when the single market was signed . 
  if it had stayed as the common market we most likely would n't be having this conversation . 
  well we were . 
  we were talking about it in reference to the scottish referendum in 2014 . 
  as i said , * `` now if you want to provide constitutional eu changes since then , then now is your opportunity . 
  '' * so have at it . 
  i 'm all ears . 
  constitutional reforms in this regard since then . 
  because i know ( and i suspect you know ) , there has been a new treaty since then . 
  so what the old commission stands , and it 's backed up with what the new commission and council are saying now in that scotland does n't have legal competence . 
  but please , provide us with a new legal or treaty ruling , if you will , that changes the dynamic ... 
  to be fair you 've been randomly trying to find things to say , from the nationality of the then commissioner ( which should n't be relevant give the commission oath ) to the point that 2014 declarations are n't relevant ( even when talking about 2014 referendumss ) , just to hold up an argument i think you 've now lost sight of . 
  so it 's probably a good stage to now draw a line under it . 
  and yet having the uk voting out the commission and the council have both said that scotland does not have the competence . 
  i mean , at this point you 're just arguing for the sake of it jumping from argument to argument , hot potato style , as each get shot down . 
  they 've literally just said that is n't the case . 
  and again that simply is n't the case , and `` explained on this sub '' hardly emboldens your case . 
  i 'm happy to link to rulings from the last time . 
  now if you want to provide constitutional eu changes since then , then now is your opportunity . 
  oh stop it , i said , * `` that makes no difference either , for the same reason as the last scottish independence referendum . 
  if scotland votes to leave the uk it still has to start the eu ascension process anew . 
  '' * you replied , * `` as pointed out multiple times before , this is not the case . 
  '' * nothing has changed constitutionally since the last time , and as you claimed to the contrary ` multiple times before ' simply did n't apply , as before it had been spelled out that it was the case that they 'd have to reapply . 
  and the article is 2 years old because we were talking about the last scottish independence referendum , which was in 2014 . 
  as claimed multiple times by members of the snp , and when asked to back it up with correspondence to that effect with the commission , which at one point they claimed they had , it turned out they did n't have at all . 
  and it was actually the advice of the president of the commission at the time that scotland would have to reapply again . 
  that makes no difference either , for the same reason as the last scottish independence referendum . 
  if scotland votes to leave the uk it still has to start the eu ascension process anew . 
  either way it makes no difference , and it is why the snp should have been more tactically agnostic about eu membership over say eea membership which it could walk into the next day . 
  i wonder if the uk will have a trade deal with canada before the eu . 
  precisely not in those terms . 
  he actually took the net figure and sprayed it around different services . 
  completely different to the ` bus ' claim , which is actually more of a proposal and unaffiliated . 
  as it 's the morning after the morning after we can afford to cut down on the spin a little . 
  the horse has already bolted , so to speak . 
  ###### ** claim one : # 350m a week for the nhs ** this claim was pretty thoroughly broken down and expunged in the campaign . 
  # 350m was always a somewhat dubious gross figure , not a net figure . 
  that it * could * go instead to the nhs was always a voteleave proposal . 
  it was always going to be up to whomever the uk voted for in a general election who would decide what gets spent where . 
  importantly this was a vote leave campaign message . 
  the official campaign . 
  the one that farage did n't win . 
  he was grassroots out and connected to leave.eu . 
  he ca n't wriggle out of something that his campaign did n't claim . 
  not even if it 's farage . 
  he was the one with the dodgy immigrants poster . 
  ###### ** claim two : reducing immigration ** * `` if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the eu they are going to be disappointed . 
  of course there is still going to be immigration . 
  there are still going to be people coming here to work and you will look in vain for anything the leave campaign said at any point that suggested there would be any kind of border closure or pulling up of the drawbridge . 
  all we 're asking for is some control over roughly who comes in . 
  '' * that 's straight up true . 
  it was always argued that it was about getting immigration controls . 
  it was always a case that if the people wanted to put immigration up then they would be able to do so by voting accordingly at a general election .
