there was no excuse for the dunblane massacre either . 
  it was n't just a man who went crazy , the system simply was n't followed in that case and the whole thing is extremely sinister for even more reasons than a man carrying out a shooting in a school . 
  you do n't get d-notices from the pm silencing the media , former foreign secretaries ( cook again ) calling for fresh investigations , witnesses not called , and key figures calling it a whitewash , and for there not to be something else at play . 
  even with the system in place at the time the events of early 90s could have played out a thousand times and every single time had the system been followed then thomas hamilton would have failed to receive a gun license a thousand times over - and spectacularly so . 
  yet this local odd ball , banned from being a scout leader , known and investigated by the police for counts of paedophilia , who was known to have held serious grudges with the local village whom he blamed for his business failing ( again connected though their suspicion of his paedophilia ) . 
  someone lord robertson himself admits to having had arguments with in his own home !? 
  dunblane was clearly a shooting ; but it 's far too sinister to just put it down to gun laws and random individuals losing the plot . 
  occam 's razor suggests a connection with operations ore and avalanche where the fbi provided a british sting operation with thousands of credit cards attached to child pornography , some of which were , according to the fbi , connected with high offices in government ... and then there 's a 100yr national secrecy order is placed on dunblane . 
   as i said , you are welcome . 
  please invest in weaker currencies . 
  and i agreed . 
  fact is i 'd rather be the investor than the invested - what i 've said all along . 
   funny how you cling on the numbers . 
  i mentioned the requirements but you are still ignoring them . 
  ignoring the requirements ? 
  you said the requirements had to be the thousands . 
  you said . 
  you said it . 
  said it did you . 
  response : hundreds of thousands , in some cases millions . 
   i said understanding . 
  you do n't know what you said . 
  i 've been acting as your editor , so shocking the comprehension . 
   bingo first time a greek has said that in a while ...  now that you lost the argument you start the ad hominems . 
  you 've got to be freaking kidding me . 
  you 've done nothing but launch as hominems rater than answer a simple question : would you rather be ` that ' , ( 1 ) providing the service to the tourist , or would you rather be ` they ' , ( 2 ) those that have the disposable income with the stronger currency enabling them to visit ? 
   declare you are defeated ... i would still love to see it . 
  greece ; you 're projecting . 
  i feel i should adjust the question to i ) wish to be able to visit , ii ) wish to be visited , iii ) our economy is in the shitter and people still are n't visiting . 
  pseudo economics from greece at midnight - love it . 
   as i have already mentioned all the answers are in the other posts you have done this a dozen times and i bit and spoon fed you . 
  this is getting awkward . 
  ca n't get away from the fact you know you 'd rather be the tourist ...  hahaha , again you address my origin but you have no idea . 
  i laugh behind my monitor at your conclusion for it is on par with the rest of your arguments . 
  i laugh because either you 're hitting a stereotype , or you 're from the continent and that 's even worse because i ca n't think of anyone that did n't know the situation that led you into thinking thousands , and not hundreds of thousands . 
   i am not sure if you even are english . 
  your understanding of the language is really , really limited . 
  saying that to someone who knows it is not so does n't help you . 
  saying it to someone that 's had to literally interpret articles for you ... doubly so . 
   you do not understand an argument in your own language how would you even write in another . 
  well first of all , wordsworth , there 's a comma wandering homeless that should be in there somewhere , and the eroteme is missing . 
  if you 're going to write a sentence questioning my english , at least write it properly !, 
   i like how you shift between conclusions . 
  first i am an american then i am not a european and vice versa . 
  you are funny indeed . 
  nope . 
  i said you were so oblivious to europe you had to be western pacific , i then said that if you were european then it would be double shame . 
  ( p.s. ), 
  i 'm playing with the idea that you 're a stereotypical yank commenting on europe ( in reality there 's quite a few of them that are well informed ) . 
  i know you 're greek ... kinda makes the whole economic thing ironic you thieving , conniving bastard , if you think about it . 
   no wonder you 're bitter about strong currencies reaping it in . 
  where i reap ; you bow . 
  ( p.p.s. ), 
  come to think of it ... no wonder you 'd rather be the visited than the tourist . 
  it 'd be like a flash back to the good old times !, 
   stop avoiding my arguments what arguments ? 
  all you 've done is to poo-poo the other arguments . 
  you 've provided nothing in soooo long , and when you did it was because you misread something . 
   edit : even your english is so bad . 
  oh , now i know it stung when i said it . 
  was it when i twirled you on whether you were us or continental ? 
  you ca n't possibly be continental given your misunderstandings of europe , you did n't even know about the uk middleclass migration ( so far you 've called it rich , and less than thousands - so you 're certainly not spanish ) my english is so bad not only do i have to provide links to the obvious ( one of the early posts regarded much of this as a given and obvious ) , i 've even on occasion had to teach you how to read them !, 
   you are unable to understand an argument . 
  then let 's go back to the beginning . 
  the very beginning . 
  one point at a time , i agreed that with a weak currency comes tourism , i just said that i 'd rather be with the comparatively strong currency , with the dispensable income that obviously comes with it , than being the ` mat ' . 
  the serf . 
  the waiter . 
  ** straight forward enough , but you missed it again :d ** one of your first points : would you rather be ` that ' , ( 1 ) providing the service to the tourist , or would you rather be ` they ' , ( 2 ) those that have the disposable income with the stronger currency enabling them to visit ? 
  [ edit ] if you have a latin evolved language i can do this in your native if it helps . 
  i 'm english . 
  we have a * way * . 
  you 're not european contrary to your earlier lies , and english clearly is n't your first ( fucking disaster if it * supposedly * is / writing is okay but comprehension is bollocks ) , so i 'm thinking hispanic ? 
   we are still here because you responded to my post . 
  i know . 
  a post i asked for . 
  it 's lost on you but i love it all the same . 
   we both know you have a weak little ego ... 
  i like to think of my ego as a hatched dragon egg bulged in the furnaces of vulcan , but i 'm a bigger person , ego if you will , to not take on such lazy slurs personally . 
  cute that we each diss our intelligence , and that you flip to ego , it the brinkmanship of intelligentsia you just swerved . 
   as i said , i showed you how your preference was based on a false premise . 
  ... oh so i 'll go on not capitalising on the illusion of me actually having done what you ca n't , and millions doing what you said would n't , could n't , be done . 
  i 'll contact my currency broker now shall i ? 
  `` sorry geoff , bloke on the internet says that i 'm doing , what i 'm actually doing , does n't happen ... maybe you should let all your other clients know . 
   declare you are defeated because even though a technicality i would still love to see it written by you . 
  dude i 'm loving this so much after all your about-turns i 've already drawn you back to the first point . 
  that does n't mean i 'll forget that you conceded that the economic point i was making would be relevant only if it applied to the thousands , and that it stands in the hundreds of thousands , millions in some case . 
  or that i 'll constantly rib you for your attempt to address my english with * your * and * you 're * , let alone understanding adjectives . 
  i 'll say it again ` cos i 'm having fun : stop avoiding . 
  would you rather be ` that ' , ( 1 ) providing the service to the tourist , or would you rather be ` they ' , ( 2 ) those that have the disposable income with the stronger currency enabling them to visit ? 
  choose . 
  i 'm quite happy to say i 'm of the latter . 
  et tu : 1 or 2 ? 
  ** [ edit ] ** i 'm english so i 'm perfectly fluent in all proper latin based languages . 
  if it helps , i 'll shift so that you can discuss me in your native tongue . 
   as for the point , i have already addressed it , debunked your argument and showed a dozen of times how stupid you sound when you try to rationalize a preference with faulty premises . 
  why keep saying this when we 're 2 weeks in . 
  of my own design , and we know you 're lying ... it 's irrelevant anyhoo . 
  i 'm even forgiving of the points you just raised with regards to * your * and * you 're * . 
  you were wrong .
