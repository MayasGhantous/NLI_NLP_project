  you realised that . 
  fair enough . 
  move on , you clearly want to. , , stop avoiding . 
  would you rather be ` that ' , ( 1 ) providing the service to the tourist , or would you rather be ` they ' , ( 2 ) those that have the disposable income with the stronger currency enabling them to visit ? 
  choose . 
  i 'm quite happy to say i 'm of the latter . 
  et tu : 1 or 2 ? 
  this is literally amongst the original points . 
  it was your crux that this happened and i agreed with you , although it took some time for you to read that . 
  the question is : 1 or 2 ? 
  christ i 'm not about to be your english tutor too . 
  there 's probably an r/teachmeenglish for that ... let 's take it back to beginnings if that 's where we must go , one step at a time : you said that a weaker currency encourages tourism . 
  i agreed . 
  * would you rather be ` that ' , providing the service to the tourist , or would you rather be ` they ' , those that have the disposable income with the stronger currency enabling them to visit ? 
  * i 'm ` they ' . 
  choose for yourself . 
   but the statement does stand . 
  did you just do a wookie argument ? 
   of what verb is `` knowledge '' a subject ? 
  you 're amero spelling i did n't use it as a verb you numpty , i chose to use it as an adjective . 
  we can do that sort of shit in english . 
  check out shakespeare . 
  dude does it all the time . 
  we think high things of him , ... you would rather want to be my invested and i am willing to be your investor owner . 
  have we reached a solution ? 
  i 'm happy if you are . 
   ahaha , ofcourse without premise . 
  that is what you have been keep doing all the time . 
  claims without premise . 
  gives premise . 
  claims without premise ... yawn . 
   by the way , it is your not you 're . 
  is n't that ironic as well ? 
  not really , if you noticed i said `` you 're amero spelling and your defunct european logic/common knowledge '' that 's completely accurate . 
  i did n't say your amero spelling , i said ' ** you are ** amero spelling , ' and ' ** your ** defunct european logic/common knowledge ' '' notice that ? 
  proper use of the language . 
  you are amero-spelling . 
  you 're . 
  knob . 
  it 's one thing getting a typo , which i did n't in this case . 
  it 's another thing to call someone out on it and to get it ballsed up yourself . 
   why are you talking about yourself . 
  let me explain it to you with algebra . 
  you have lost . 
  it is a fact . 
  why not accept it ? 
   how about the fact that i kept you left hanging for 2 weeks just to rub it in ? 
  let alone that statement does n't even stand . 
  you 've already balked in response to this is n't being your first language , which in itself is n't yet a sin , but your reading comprehension has been poor , you 've failed to even read links properly , and you 've just tried to correct me on  you 're < and gotten it spectacularly wrong . 
  ` perfick ' as the darling buds would say . 
   i do n't expect you to understand the metaphor . 
  at this point i do n't expect you to understand english properly . 
   you are stupid . 
  and after 2 weeks of leaving you holding , and now that it is just you and i. . . 
  ... even you know that i am your superior . 
   hahaha , here is another pound there , my little jokester . 
  you prove it again then for me . 
  stronger currency manipulates the weaker . 
   you are my little bitch . 
  [ you 're the one that wanted to argue the benefit of being the visited over the visitor . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/nih2r/europe_prepare_for_a_riotous_2012_if_eurozone/c39fmvk ) i agreed that the weaker income draws more tourism , etc. 
  i 'd just rather be the person with the power to be a tourist or not . 
  [ edit ] notice how you shifted from you wanting to be the invested to my investor ? 
  or how when you conceded i had a point if it was in the thousands only it turned out to be in the hundreds of thousands , in some cases millions ? 
  stereotype . 
   lol what . 
  no you did n't . 
  apart from stupid you are also ignorant . 
  your life must really really suck . 
  wahoooo ... struck a nerve !, 
    so you are american !, 
   as with the rest of the arguments , you again inferred something without premises . 
  without premise , you 're amero spelling and your defunct european logic/common knowledge , to boot with commenting on , in references to yourself saying that you were one of the continentals , and then calling it ironic that , i should say so ... 
  i 'd say if you 're not american then the green card should be in the post as a de-facto stereotype . 
   you do n't understand your own language now . 
  ahh ... failed to defend english as your first twice . 
  explains a lot . 
   so you corrected the spelling mistake but did n't refer to the statement . 
  good , i know it is you then . 
  oh yeah because carl ` sagean ' and that loose metaphor even came close to a point . 
   hahaha , you are so much fun . 
  there , here is another pound little jester . 
  my coup de gr\u00e2ce : ** give another pound to me : who said a strong currency could n't exploit the weak ???? 
  ** notice how you did n't even address an actual point , i 'll stick with the last for now , i feel we 've reached a solution . 
  you would rather want to be my invested bitch and i am willing to be your investor owner . 
  have we reached a solution ? 
  i 'm happy if you are . 
   the article was dissed because it had no cause and effect illustrated . 
  that 's not what you just said !, 
   p.s. 
  you do n't know what irony means . 
  i 'm english , fucker . 
  we designed it . 
   i have said already that i read the article . 
  why do n't you read the posts ? 
  are you blind ? 
  because you have a habit of saying you 've read something and missing everything . 
   i certainly wo n't leave it to you , since i already told you 7 times at least how my statement worked with the requirements . 
  you certainly belong to far left of the '' x '' line . 
  nope .
