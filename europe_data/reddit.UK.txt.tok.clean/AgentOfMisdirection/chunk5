  thanks man , thank you for accepting it at last . 
  there 's only millions of us doing it . 
   please keep fueling the weaker currencies ' economy . 
  i will . 
  very first post i said to you was that i agreed that i was doing that ( had to keep saying it for it to sink with you though ) , my whole point , from the start , has been i 'd rather be the one with the stronger currency than the weak . 
  go back and look if you need to   then again , the uk is so expensive you ca n't buy shit there . 
  no , not really . 
  best of both worlds with fixed dividends and a subsidiary income in pounds and with a bank account still in the uk . 
  my whole point from the start . 
  as it goes some things are still cheaper , so it is a best of both worlds for those willing to capitalise on a strong currency and live with a foot in both states ... as i 've been arguing . 
  if you know what you 're doing you can not only get more bang for your buck , but even turn a profit . 
   you wrote so much and yet without content . 
  i actually provided all the content & links ... you 're simply being a sounding board to it . 
  you 've provided none yourself . 
  again . 
  go back and look . 
   well , not big a suprise there . 
  oh , you 're so raging just now in your ineptitude . 
  go on . 
  tell me i ca n't capitalise on a strong currency again after just having a 2 week holiday ( because of the weaker currency , if it holds , there should be another four 1-2 week holidays this year ) and when the monthly transfer this month/last month is going to be more than it has been for years !, 
  please . 
  do it . 
  tell me i 'm not capitalising on it ... 
   so you are still stuck at the first point . 
  haha you are such a failure of a debater . 
  fyi you are still getting massacred . 
  big talk for someone being schooled . 
  let 's have a looksy shall we ? 
    that 's not who 's migrating to france , they are people who say for themselves that it is to capitalise on gains on their uk property and the strong pound . 
   this makes no sense , my illiterate friend . 
  well putting ` illiterate ' to one side for now because i think it will come back to haunt you ( and coming from someone that had to have the fact that i was agreeing with you , and that you were agreeing with my initial points in two consecutive comments , but that i was seeing it from the other perspective before you decided to drop it ) the point makes complete sense . 
  those moving to france and such countries with a weaker currency are clear in that they do so in part to capitalise on the weaker currency and to make the most of the gains they 'd made on property and income earned in a stronger currency . 
  it 's simple and straight forward . 
  it 's actively happening . 
  it has happened . 
  it 's what the spanish economy was built on before it joined the euro ; people with a much stronger currency and buying value than the peseta driving development . 
   so your whole argument that the stronger currency will buy property easier and hence cause the rise of the prices is not exclusive for the weaker currencies . 
  who said it was exclusively the reason ? 
  i certainly did n't . 
  i simply stated that if you have a million britons in spain , or several hundred thousand in france , buying properties then there are going to be whole regions having their prices driven up by those with a strong currency . 
   so you admit that you do n't know the specific numbers , right ? 
  then , even if you isolate my statement ( the one about hundrends of thousands ) you still are not right since you are not specific . 
  the specific numbers are changing all the time . 
  you said it would take people moving in their thousands . 
  i simply showed that it was people moving in their hundreds of thousands each year . 
  if you argue that for the effect to happen would take thousands and then you are shown it happens to that extent plus to a factor of 100 at least , then you have conceded the point . 
    british buyers represent 11 per cent of the market ( after portuguese and french expat buyers ) and although still at ** a low ** level , sales to south africans , australians , new zealanders and ** americans ** are rising , largely due to favourable exchange rates  thanks for that , did n't see it . 
  you just added another counter point : `` low '' . 
  hindsight = 0 is n't it ? 
  i told you the illiterate thing would come back to bite you . 
  the article says that the relative low level applies to americans ( south africans , australians , new zealanders ) , not that the british with the strong pound are at a low level . 
  who were we talking about again ? 
  that 's right , the british with their strong pound . 
  you simply did n't read it right . 
    from the same article :   back in france , however , housing investors -- especially those in paris -- are still loving life . 
  the reason : price gains in 2010 pushed the median square-foot price in the capital to over $ 650 for the first time ever -- a level that 's set to increase to $ 742 within a year . 
  though it 's difficult to make an accurate comparison with larger and far more diverse housing markets , existing numbers suggest paris is creeping closer to the prices seen in notoriously expensive london and new york city . 
  but experts warn that is n't necessarily a good thing . 
   more here :   r -- and which will only get tighter until both government and developers summon the will , and the finances , to build more homes . 
   so this is n't cause and effect . 
  the cause is n't the foreigner 's buying power . 
  nobody said it was the sole cause . 
  you simply just argued two points that i 've already made , one of which you said at the start of this post that `` makes no sense , my illiterate friend . '', 
  well , i said that people in the uk capitalised on the stronger currency and the strength of property in the uk , you 've just shown the french capitalising on the strength of their property increases in the same sense - arguing part of what i 've just said , which you called ` illiterate ' . 
  i also said that the french government were having to encourage new builds to compensate for the influx outpricing people with a weaker currency ... you just highlighted the article i provided arguing just that !, 
  there is government policy to encourage new builds to counter the effect i 'd described . 
   lol at this one . 
  now , it is n't a big suprise really . 
  it comes from the telegraph . 
  cute story but does n't answer shit . 
  you are spamming articles because your argument per se is weak . 
  are you really arguing that expats are lying to the telegraph , or that the telegraph is making it up that expats leave for their home shores when their own earnings reach a closer parity to their new countries ? 
  they move when their gbp pensions and fixed dividends have greater purchasing parity overseas , something you 've already argued , now you 're arguing they are n't moving back when the purchasing parity is n't what it was . 
  you are pathetic . 
  it was in response to this : `` instead , like the british press , they simply quote estate agents who say that les anglais in france have stopped buying , and started selling . '', 
  it 's pathetic to link to estate agents in france saying that when the uk currency weakened they started selling - substantiating what i 've said all along !, 
   you misunderstood me . 
  i bet it happens to you a lot !, 
  it was in reference to you saying that it was a 6 line article and me saying you had to click the ` read more ' button . 
   the article referring to the cause and effect was essentially 6 sentences with no proof . 
  the `` read on '' option expands the page with a bunch of statistics describing the population . 
  really ? 
  `` more than 198,000 british nationals moved overseas last year , bringing the total number of brits abroad to more than 5.5 million , according to new research from the institute for public policy research , published today ( monday ) . 
  the report says that a strong economy at home has encouraged emigration and that very few britons leave because they think ` the country has gone to the dogs ' . '', 
  that 's just the next paragraph ... there 's another nine , and then a whole load of facts , statistics and sources , something you rejected it for not having !!!, 
  something you dismissed as a six line article !!!, 
  lol . 
  even when told to open it up you still fail to scroll down as the article continues . 
   first i talked about prices and salary . 
  you did n't give me those . 
  secondly , you appeal to anecdotal evidence . 
  tell me how many expats are saying this . 
  n00b if you could read the links you 'd hear that 's exactly what you 've been shown . 
   your case is hopeless . 
  everytime you post and try to mask your ignorance and stupidity with irrelevant links and premises , defunct arguments based on said premises and anecdotal evidence , a few more of my brain cells fade away . 
  you are what the internet subculture would call : a fucktard . 
  did i fail to mention that i 'm back from the uk now ? 
  that 's right . 
  i 'm one of those very people you have tried to argue ca n't capitalise from a stronger currency who is , has , and continues to capitalise on a stronger currency . 
  i made you wait for 2 weeks ; but it was fun watching you argue against even your own points seeing it only from a unipolar perspective .
