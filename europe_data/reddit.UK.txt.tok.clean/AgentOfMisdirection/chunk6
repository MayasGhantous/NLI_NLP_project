  call it a new year 's gift to me !, 
   no i did n't . 
  i linked the article as a reason of why these citizens go out of london or migrate . 
  you linked to a paragraph which talked about people struggling to get on the market in the uk . 
  that 's not who 's migrating to france , they are people who say for themselves that it is to capitalise on gains on their uk property and the strong pound . 
  you 've just been caught in an outright lie . 
   what ? 
  first of all , the thousands do n't go only to france . 
  did n't i just get through saying that they do n't only go to france , but spain and australia amongst other places ? 
  did n't i ? 
  yes i did . 
  i even linked to articles about it . 
   in fact the article does n't say where they go . 
  it says to europe . 
  also , do n't be a fucking liar . 
  nowhere did the article say that the french do n't buy property . 
  france is the number one destination and you 've already been given figures . 
  they do represent 11 % of the market `` british buyers represent 11 per cent of the market ( after portuguese and french expat buyers ) and although still at a low level , sales to south africans , australians , new zealanders and americans are rising , largely due to favourable exchange rates . 
  read that last line again ... 
  ... ... '' ... largely due to favourable exchange rates . '', 
  lol . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/travel/france_show/8744662/understanding-the-french-property-market.html i simply said that only 57 % of french people own their own properties , and that 's true , `` but the downside is that the rising value of french real estate is only good news to those who already own housing -- a group that makes up only 57 % of the french population . '', 
  http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2039840,00.html as for the bit you chose to put in bold , you 've already been told and given links which show that the french government has had to introduce policy to allow those not on the ladder to own a home in a market which has continued to price them out . 
  there are government subsidies for icf new builds , and existing renovation . 
  they 've had to do it because the french property market rich with expats has left them behind . 
  expats which are clear the role a stronger currency has served . 
  in fact , as parity neared expats began to leave , so the trend and correlation to currency is clear from 2009 when the euro was quickly gaining ground on the pound : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyinfrance/cest-la-folie/5093769/property-in-france-are-british-expats-really-leaving-france.html as the trend reversed and the pound gained strength , the market too improved in direct relation . 
  ( i 'm feeling very smug right now - i just wanted you to know that )  and lol @ the fucking articles . 
  oh this should be good ...  you link a help resources site . 
  yes to the expat community saying how expats are capitalising on a strong currency . 
   then you link an article which is actually not an article . 
  it is a 6 sentence paragraph with no citations from 2006 . 
  that 's where you click [ read on ] ( http://www.ippr.org/press-releases/111/2513/strong-pound-and-booming-house-prices-help-brits-move-abroad ) and the whole article folds down ... * what a tool . 
  * that it 's from 2006 is neither here nor there , it still shows what i 'm arguing as economically having , what you 're arguing against , as already having happened !, 
   you fucking retard . 
  you did n't include prices and the salary . 
  not me , the ippr and the expat community at large themselves . 
  they 're the ones saying it !, 
  you 're in the process of arguing with expats as to why they have migrated !, 
  i think they should know why they left or invested overseas !, 
   address my point . 
  you do n't have a point anymore . 
  you just have bits . 
  i 'm leaving work now for the christmans period , so i 'll catch up making fun off you in the new year . 
  just leave me a little orange to come back to . 
  you truly have just been spanked btw . 
  14lbs to the stone , 16oz to the pound when the romans had 12 and the word ounce is derived from the word ` onza ' for twelve , which sounds like ` onze ' , french for eleven ; 12 pennies to the shilling , 20 shillings to the pound and a penny is denoted with a 'd ' . 
  a two bob bit was 2s or 24d , and was called a florin . 
  i have a theory that it was a counter-invasionary precaution , much like why distances on cornish roadsigns are randomly generated . 
  to be fair argentina has n't learned much from its own crises either . 
  it has 24 % inflation but its government has only set official inflation at 10 % . 
  it 's own crisis is right around the corner . 
   for the first time since 2007 -- when statisticians and field workers at the national institute of statistics and censuses were replaced with political appointees and the official inflation rate started to fall -- the once-hot-button issue of inflation in argentina is fading from the front pages , said victor beker , director of the center for research on the new economy at the university of belgrano . 
   `` what the government set out to do was to suppress alternative statistics , '' beker said . 
  `` the objective is to ensure that the consultancies stop publishing and that the official numbers become the only statistics . '' argentina is currently doing exactly what greece did , fluffing figures to make things look better on paper !, 
  being a little dishonest there are n't you . 
  the wikipedia article is `` affordability of housing in the ** united kingdom ** '' not france . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/affordability_of_housing_in_the_united_kingdom you just argued that a strong currency does n't give purchasing power in weaker currencies by comparing the pound * to the uk !, 
  * in fact the french government has even had to introduce policy to address the problem , which is why icf lego buildings are springing up to provide affordable housing for those priced out . 
  you say it is because of demand , and yet you 've just been shown that it is not the french buying the properties . 
  it is a fact of the land that the comparable strength of the pound enabled a middle-class churn , and they 've exploited it to their own ends with trend bucking gains . 
  notice how you 're arguing how you think it should work in theory , and how i 'm arguing with facts and actualities . 
  you 're arguing how you think it should happen , and i 'm showing something that has happened and is still happening . 
  i can tell you from experience that the stronger pound has very much enabled british exploitation of foreign markets . 
  you ca n't drive down the coast of spain and not see it . 
  it 's not just france or spain either , expats benefit from a strong currency wherever they might go , ** [ `` expatriates build wealth in australiathe aussie dollar is at an all time low against the american dollar and the strong pound sterling , consequently there is strong purchasing power for expats and uk residents in australia . 
  '' ] ( http://www.escapeartist.com/live_in_australia/moving_there/ ) ** this effect you 're loathed to recognise , that 's already going on everywhere around you , is actively observable . 
  want another one ? 
  how about the institute for public policy research ... ** [ `` strong pound and booming house prices help brits move abroad '' ] ( http://www.ippr.org/press-releases/111/2513/strong-pound-and-booming-house-prices-help-brits-move-abroad ) ** i 've only strung you along this far to allow you to make a fool of yourself . 
  i understand your understanding is n't comfortable with it , but that 's a problem with your understanding . 
  if the french are n't buying existing property , but property is going up , there 's hundred of thousands of brits empowered by the pound and they have a greater purchasing power , people are being priced out by expats capitalising on a strong currency , after all , something is pushing the market up and the expats , british investors are clear that an important aspect is their strong currency and their purchasing power . 
  you do n't want to accept it but it is a fact . 
  it 's already happened . 
  oh , and british buyers represent 11 % of that market . 
  yeah , i think we can safely say they 're fueling house prices and making it more difficult for french people to get on the market . 
  i 'll go with the other points when you accept that you said the prices would go up , in context , if it were in the thousands , that you acknowledge that you did not know it was in fact in the hundreds of thousands and that prices had indeed gone up . 
  average rise of 7.8 % on the year on the back of a recession ( it was just under 6 % the year before ) . 
  57 % of french population own their own property . 
  guess who 's been making the money ... good ol' strong currency types . 
  guess who 's being priced out of the market !, 
  if the french are n't buying the properties and it 's dipping in and out of recession , with 1 % inflation - i wonder who 's driving the prices up ? 
  :d http://britishexpats.com/news/latest/france-destinatino-choice/  i dare you . 
  * seriously . 
  who says that ? 
  what age are you ? 
  * oh you dare me . 
  that makes all the difference ... hah !, 
  i 'll let you come down from the scaffold because you ` dare me ' . 
  un-freakin ' - believable . 
   you are trying big time to save your ass but you can not . 
  actually i 'm just enjoying watching you swing/getting angry . 
  you said : `` for the prices to go up there need to be thousands of british wealthy midde class citizens to come to france , buy land and affect the market ( example ) . '', 
  i then showed you that there were hundreds of thousands . 
  in fact it 's close to half a million living there , with even more owning business gites and holiday homes . 
  so you had accepted the premise . 
  you had accepted the effect . 
  you just did n't think it would happen in the numbers it would need - and in reality it is , it has , and it is common knowledge . 
  you having to resort to name calling to escape this simple conclusion is damning . 
  so which is it , were you lying before when you accepted this premise , or are you simply contradicting it now ? 
  calling me a coward for not backing off this point when you start calling names is n't going to help you .
