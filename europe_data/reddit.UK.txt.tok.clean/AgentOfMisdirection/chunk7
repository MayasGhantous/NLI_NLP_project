  what you 're really telling me is that you want me to be more of a coward and to let you off the scaffold . 
  nothing doing . 
  sorry , but you really did n't . 
  you accepted the point yourself but said it would take thousands . 
  you already accepted that . 
  you also said they were rich , but that they 're not is by the by ( although it does show you 're guessing ) . 
  you were shown that it is in the hundreds and hundreds of thousands . 
  four posts ago you were simply arguing a point you 'd already conceded . 
  you said yourself that it would happen if it was in its thousands . 
  so is your defence that you were lying earlier ? 
  you 've already accepted the point indirectly . 
  i just like squeezing you on it . 
  honestly frenchly ... 
  the fact that britishers take this piss out of the french is a sign that they love the french . 
  if ever people stopped taking the piss it should be read as a sign that you should want them to start . 
  if i call you an arsehole , you should be offended , but doubly so if i stopped . 
  if australia should ever stop calling the british , then they should be worried . 
  if , in short , it ever comes to the point that we ever stop calling names amongst our friends then all hell is going to break loose !, 
  it 's only because i can call you a knob , and you me a pillock , that we know that we are still friends !, 
   would you agree with this sentiment ? 
  and if you do , can you explain me what makes people dislike france ? 
  we do n't dislike the french . 
  we feel at liberty to call you names , and we embrace it when you call us them back !, 
  think of it this way : i 'll call my brother a useless two-bit schlump and name him rotten ( call him bad names ) . 
  i can do that because he 's my brother . 
  if somebody else does it , i 'll kill them . 
  that 's the relationship the french have with us , and if anybody else says different they 'll have the two of us to deal with . 
  my brother is not a two-bit schlump , but i 'll call him it . 
  if anybody else does i 'll drive my car through their house . 
  likewise a british man reserves the right to call the french terrible names . 
  do n't take offense , it is a term of endearment . 
  if ever something were to happen against the french the british car would be the first to drive through someone 's house . 
  ** tl :d : r ** people do n't dislike the french , they dislike the british more , but calling the french names is actually a term of endearment when it comes from the british . 
  if you can take it ; you 're alright by us . 
  if i might interject a little perspective ... ` halk ' is a scottish ` twat ' . 
  i am an english ` bastard ' . 
  if ` twat ' and ` bastard ' were to meet in person we 'd take the same pot-shots at each other , but that 'd be okay because we 'd accept that as cultural norms . 
  that is to say we 'd rag each other rotten ( call each other terrible names ) until the other wept , and then we 'd start on the welsh . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that someone calling you a blanc-flagged-cheese-guzzling-surrender-monkey should be taken in the same context . 
  british humour stipulates that you now call me an , `` ugly-yellow-toothed-big-penised-pompous-prick-of-an-asshole-who 'd - if-my-mother-hadn ` t-fucked-my - grand-uncle-then-perhaps-i 'd - have-a-chin-you-inbred-wonder ! '', 
  and that is how it works . 
  you should only be offended if we 're not offending you . 
  if we 're not offending you , per se , then you should consider ourselves friends but if , when offending you , you are not being offended , and if we do n't have a flag , then be offended for not offending you . 
  in this sense it is an offense to not offend you when dictation clearly states that you should be offended , and if you are not offended . 
  i can see how the confusion might arise . 
  protocols should be obeyed and in this sense the scottish cunt should have offered his offense in lieu of your french bastadry , i can only apologise for his wankerish ways by saying that we all are in fact slags , on behalf of my cheap english harbour-whore self . 
  the rule is if you 're not being offended then you should be offended . 
  simple really . 
  so please do n't take offense . 
  in our culture if we do n't tell you you 're a jizz-chuzzling pig fucker then we 're saying you 're not one of us . 
  we slag everybody of that we think is part of the family . 
  it 's fun . 
  ` halk ' wo n't mind : use him for target practice ... 
  so amuse me again , you acknowledged the point i was making * if * it applied to not just an individual and * if * it applied to thousands of cases . 
  i showed it to hundreds of thousand of cases . 
  so how do you rationalise those two perspectives ? 
  please . 
  and then we 'll go on to the other points of your initial argument . 
  you agreed that my point was right if it applied to thousands . 
  i showed that it applied to hundreds of thousands . 
  address and let 's move on . 
  really , that 's it ? 
  ------ ** you controversially conceded a point i 'd made if it happened in the thousands . 
  before we move on let 's acknowledge that you now accept that it happens in the hundreds of thousands , and it is , in fact , an actuality . 
  ** ------ you 're going to faint out like that ? 
  address it . 
  address it and i 'll take you up on your other points . 
  even if you 've lost a ` point ' take it on the chin if you believe in the argument and argue the narrative still stands . 
  take the point , it 's only one of others and let 's keep going . 
  you 're not one to back down , ammarite ? 
  the idea that you 're arguing this , to when the original poster thought it might stop such arguments , is ironic . 
  go ahead and tell someone else that they are not creating division , as you are the person that argues division . 
  which is all irrelevant . 
  by even arguing it you 're blaspheming the stance they take and proving others right . 
  you 're arguing against division by arguing with those divisive to you . 
  great way to undermine an argument !, 
  keep going . 
   you were defeated two times :  1 ) in the main debate . 
  2 ) in your folly attempt to garble the facts to save your ass . 
  i outed you , proved you wrong . 
  you 're struggling there for specifics . 
  you said i was n't addressing your points , i reiterated the same points and then , rather than addressing them now , amongst many , you avoided : ----- ** you controversially conceded a point i 'd made if it happened in the thousands . 
  before we move on let 's acknowledge that you now accept that it happens in the hundreds of thousands , and it is , in fact , an actuality . 
  ** -------- please . 
  stop avoiding . 
  address your contradiction and we 'll move on . 
   you may have the last words , if you want . 
  you just contradicted yourself again ( you said you were n't one to back down ) but i 'll let it pass for an address of that in ** bold ** . 
   oh my hahaha , you shitty little troll . 
  ahhh , the glorious flag of defeat ... you 've just referred to yourself twice to argue yourself once . 
  this still remains , ----- ** you controversially conceded a point i 'd made if it happened in the thousands . 
  before we move on let 's acknowledge that you now accept that it happens in the hundreds of thousands , and it is , in fact , an actuality . 
  ** ----- answer your contradiction and we 'll move on to the next ... 
  nope my little chupnick , you said it would take the thousands . 
  i actually stated that it was n't the * only * factor but that it ruled , you argued that it was the rich and not the middle-class . 
  nowhere near good enough on your part i 'm afraid . 
  you said it was n't the the middle-class but the rich and that to effect the results i described it would take thousands . 
  i showed that it was the middle-class and it was in the hundreds of thousands ... observable in real life . 
  you tried to project a supposed argument that you adopted over actuality . 
  i 'm here to pull you back to reality .
