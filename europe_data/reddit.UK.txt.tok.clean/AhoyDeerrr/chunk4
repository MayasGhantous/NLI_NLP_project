  in the previous example money indeed is `` eu '' . 
  here it 's still uk . 
  the eu has no money , money comes from the member states and is either returned to them via eu spending , parceled out to other eu states or in the uk 's scenario , part of it is immediately returned as a rebate . 
  it would seem you did not change the graph so that it showed `` operating budgetary balance '' , which shows the net contribution for each country . 
   italy is indeed 3rd . 
  as to this , this does not show ** net ** contributions , it shows total contribution before the eu spends any money on the country , which is obviously not an accurate representation of how much a country actually contributes to the eu . 
  even if we were going to only count countries gross contribution to the eu then italy is still 4th , behind the uk . 
  it only appears that italy is higher then the uk because of the uk rebate , which if we are not going to factor in eu expenses for countries it seems rather silly to factor in the rebate . 
  i am sorry , when did i call italy poor ? 
  i said '' ** poorer ** '' as in less wealthy relative to germany . 
  which is an irrefutable fact . 
   you and your comrade above should get real infos from the right places . 
  italy is the 3rd net contributor to the eu . 
  this is not accurate either . 
  italy is the 5th largest net contributor ( 2014 ) according to [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) . 
   again what ? 
  if we were speaking of different things , it 's not like this can be the same one again . 
  he/she said again because he/she was reiterating his/her point , `` why would germany want that '' . 
  that seems pretty obvious . 
   why would germany not want a more united europe in your opinion ? 
  because i mean , everything merkel is pushing for is exactly going in that direction afaik . 
  maybe because a fix for the current economic situation would mean the creation of fiscal transfers which would inevitably mean huge sums of money being sent from germany ( and other north european countries ) to the poorer states . 
  status quo is in germany 's national interest . 
  never mind the potential loss of support for the party this could cause , i imagine that many germans would not be happy with the government shipping their tax money to poorer countries in southern europe , countries that are often portrayed by the media as economically incompetent and lazy . 
  england as a whole gets neglected when it comes to government funding , receiving less than the uk average . 
  maybe there would be more money to support cornwall ( and other hard up parts of england ) if we had a more fair system for the distribution of the government budget but , oh wait that is right scotland wont allow that to happen because it will mean losing most of if not all of its # 12 billion subsidy . 
  as to your earlier statement about wales being neglected , it receives 11 % more money from the government per person than uk average , less than scotland and northern ireland but more than any part of england . 
  i do agree that wales should receive more money because unlike scotland it actually needs it . 
  the problem is that the only choice right now is to either reform the distribution of the government budget ( which as i already stated will not happen because muh scottish subsidy ) or take even more money from the english funding , which would be nonsense . 
  cornish independence is not even remotely likely , you are more likely to see an independent yorkshire . 
  something like 90 % of people in cornwall identify as british or english and the party for cornwall has next to no public support and is not even looking for independence , it wants devolution , which is something that pretty much every part of england wants . 
  cornwall , as pointed out somewhere else in this thread is also one of the poorest parts of northern europe , going independent would be an economic disaster . 
  the same is true ( to varying degrees ) for wales and northern ireland also , both are incredibly dependent on economic support from the uk . 
  shame really i would love to see an independent england some day . 
  why not just let them have a referendum ? 
  likely outcome would be independence anyway and if cameron says no the news will be saturated for weeks on end with interviews from snp members about how cameron is refusing the rights of the scottish people to another referendum . 
  in any case scottish independence at this point seems basically inevitable , what use is there in delaying ? 
  besides , it will be quite hilarious to watch the snp try to deal with the huge government deficit whilst trying to appease their hugely socialist population . 
  lets hope so . 
  you seem to forget the main reason for fptp voting and the way we vote for mps in the uk , which at the end of the day is to represent the people who live in their constituency . 
  so bearing that in mind , in my fantasy scenario if edinburgh and the islands vote overwhelmingly to stay in the uk while the scottish population as a whole decides to leave the uk , should edinburgh and the islands get another referendum on whether or not to stay with an independent scotland or rejoin the uk ? 
  because your whole argument rests on the idea that scotland can do so , but none `` countries '' can not for some arbitrary reason . 
  just so you know i want scotland to leave the uk so by all means have another referendum if we choose to leave the eu . 
  i made this post simply to point out your flawed logic . 
  two birds with one stone . 
  two birds with one stone . 
   p.s. 
  look at the anglo irish trade wars too see what happens to a smaller economy when it attacks a larger one . 
  ireland got devastated so badly then because it was so incredibly dependent on exports to the uk and the import-export scale was so highly disproportionate in favour of the uk . 
  the items the uk put tariffs on ( irish agricultural products ) made up 90 % of all of ireland 's exports , whereas uk exports to ireland would have only made up a tiny % of total uk exports . 
  a situation such as that would be incredibly unlikely to happen because the uk is not remotely dependent on exports to the eu . 
  if anything the eu is more dependent on trade with the uk because the uk imports more from the eu than it exports to the eu . 
  none of which happened in the period of the british empire ... scotland was not a conquest of the british empire , scotland was a willing co-founder of the british empire . 
  why would anyone in scotland cry over the british empire ? 
  or need to let anything go ? 
  scotland was a willing participant of the empire and a massive beneficiary of its existence . 
  i am completely ignorant on what has been going on in poland the last few weeks . 
  would you mind explaining it to me in a simple and short way ? 
  i would be grateful . 
  i mean looking at the election they only got a majority of seats but why is that such an issue exactly ? 
  i mean they got the largest number of votes by a fairly significant margin ( not a majority of votes mind due ) , so clearly people support their policies . 
  this is not really a good thing for the pro eu side . 
  the mere existence of eu participation will piss people off and will easily be used to push the anti eu narrative . 
  on top of that pretty much any information the commission attempts to push will be dismissed by a significant part of the population simply because of the source . 
  this is already happening , in every single part of england . 
  indeed it is a skewed relationship , one group has a devolved government while opposing a unified devolved government of another and insane amounts of money being shoveled over hadrian 's wall . 
  the sooner scotland leaves the better . 
   uk is a non-integrated country created by simple , primitive conquest of scotland scotland was not conquered by england , the scottish government of the time accepted and allowed the union between scotland and england to exist , creating gb . 
   the english have no right to keep scottish lands yes because that is exactly how things work . 
  the eu would not be in a position to subsidies scotland on the scale that the uk does , not even close . 
  the uk gives more money to scotland than the eu does to poland ( the country that receives the most eu funds ) and expecting scotland to get even remotely the same amount of money from the eu as poland does is pure fantasy . 
  that is especially true when you take into account that in this scenario the uk has left the eu and the uk is one of the largest net contributors to the eu budget . 
   how great are the chances for scotland to leave the uk ? 
  if there was another independence referendum today , i would imagine scotland would vote to leave . 
  i also get the feeling that if the uk does vote to leave the eu , scotland will not be voting to leave so there will likely be another referendum , which may very well pass . 
  that being said apparently the scottish oil industry is going down the pan right now so snp might prefer to continue to suckle at the uk teat until it recovers . 
  ireland is not part of nato and officially at least is a neutral country , so has no official military alliances . 
  but if the end goal of the eu is a federal europe at some point a unified corporate tax policy surely has to come ? 
  i hope so . 
  yeah but the article talks about us-uk freedom of movement and contains polls on the subject . 
  yes it does but usually when this topic is talked about it generally only encompasses australia , nz and canada . 
  as you can see in the article . 
  yeah obviously they would , but if they refuse to the adhere to the new rule ( in this case learning spanish ) then too bad , it is their fault , kick them out . 
  even if it was me in this situation i might not like it but that is irrelevant , if i choose to refuse to learn spanish and knowing spanish is a requirement to settle there then i should be punished accordingly . 
  this is not really hard to understand . 
  why do you think people would care ? 
  in this hypothetical situation if spain wants to make such a rule then that 's fine by me . 
  far be it from me or any british person to tell the spanish government how to act , because you know what ? 
  they do not represent us ... 
  what is your point exactly ? 
  if that is not against the rules in said country what is the problem ? 
  if it is against the rules why are they being let in ? 
  people on this sub-reddit seem to think that british people want a set of rules for all immigrants that come to the uk but expect and demand that foreign countries should not be allowed to apply that same set of rules in their own country . 
  i could not care less if all british people that could not speak spanish were deported from spain , your country , your rules , if british people can not follow them then get rid of them , simple . 
  exactly , a statement of intent to adopt the euro once the requirements are met . 
  assuming the eu does not die at any point soon , reforms are more than likely to happen and there will be progress towards federalisation at that point scotland and all other eu countries not using the euro will be forced to adopt it . 
  another point is that countries for years have been artificially and purposefully breaching the requirements for euro entry in order to avoid being pressured into adopting the euro , at some point the council and commission patience will end in this regard . 
  the reality is that scotland will not be able to sit in a state of limbo forever . 
  we live in an age of political correctness , if anyone had spoken out against it they would have been instantly branded a racist but on the whole i imagine people were probably pretty pissed off by it . 
  i am by no means an expert and my experience with scots is incredibly limited , but i think your example is kind of similar yes , though i do not think it is as extreme as aavl .
