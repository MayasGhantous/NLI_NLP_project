  i am english , anything i type is automatically perfectly correct english . 
  ^ fuck ^ you . 
  lol, 
  i disagree , there 's very little benifit in spending time teaching school children foreign languages , and in my opinion the teaching of foreign languages should be scrapped entirely . 
  we already speak english , let 's use it as an advantage and spend more time and money in other areas of study . 
  nope , some countrys do n't combust every century leaving the scraps strewn across the table waiting for people to gobble them up . 
  every country however does have problems with nepotisim , corruption and inequality.russia had a chance after the fall , but people of the right stuff were not in the right place at the right time . 
  the primeminister was unable to take action due to the actions of other elected representatives . 
  i can understand why this might be mocked by a country dominated by the leeches who grabbed everything they could after the fall of the soviet union , a country where it 's mp 's take their seats in parliament to avoid prosecution , a country that has been under the thumb of a former kgb agent and his cronnies for 14 years . 
  little island or not , what happened was a good thing and i 'm proud to see that we 're not going to waltz in guns blazing . 
  it 's our land now , jog on . 
  all ours, 
  lol . 
  you 're fucking nuts . 
  you hate anyone north of the alps , and just endlessly spew this bollocks . 
  what british children ? 
  the only words most english people know are `` god save the queen '' and `` ennnngland victorious '' i 'd imagine scottish/welsh/irish people know even less . 
   football is serious business . 
  unless you 're a manchester united fan . 
  i ca n't imagine british school children or representatives reciting something as silly as the pledge of allegiance every assembly or in parliament / council meetings . 
  is french nationalism still a thing though ? 
  well you can clearly see 31 people people found jobs . 
  looks like everything is sorted in spain . 
  now what are we going to do about france , 6,300 people lost their jobs last month !, 
  hoping for tokyo , spain had 92 . 
  i thought txampions shtick was that he was saying that stuff in a overly sarcastic manner exactly because he did n't actually think that . 
  i think there was a reason behind why i think they 're the same person but i ca n't remember why . 
  it 's been 11 months since his last comment , which is weird does n't seem like that long .

  i thought fateswarm was txampions main . 
  there 's a thread over at [ askscience ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1l832o/a_small_volcanic_vent_suddenly_appeared_near/ ) at the moment for anyone wanting to find out if rome is going to be destroyed in some biblical style catastrophe or not . 
  yes, 
  if you did n't want a sarcastic reply , then you should n't have waffled on trying to save the image of your precious professional marchers . 
  in what world did you think that advice was needed . 
  i 'll say what i damn well please , i 'm an englishman . 
  i say we give queen elizabeth ii the empress title and have her reign over europe , but i might be biased . 
  aside from the gibraltar nonsense , that has to be the funniest uniform i have seen . 
  i guess people feel the need to make grand gestures to show how important the marriage is to them , yes it 's silly but there is so much pressure . 
  there are services that are around for those who ca n't afford to , or do n't want to spend so much , i am surprised to see the average so high to tell the truth . 
  even not going overboard , what i would consider a traditional wedding is still expensive . 
  taken from the [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/10072716/average-wedding-now-costs-more-than-18000.html ) they have these figures for the `` average wedding '' , i added euro prices for easier comparison . 
   top 10 average wedding related costs :  1 ) honeymoon # 3,582 $ 4160  2 ) catering ( wedding breakfast , evening food , canap\u00e9s , drinks ) # 2,770 $ 3217  3 ) venue ( church , civil ceremony location , reception ) # 2,164 $ 2513  4 ) rings ( wedding and engagement ring ) # 1,856 $ 2155  5 ) wedding dress # 1,098 $ 1275  6 ) photographer # 876 $ 1017  7 ) flowers , decorations & cake # 728 $ 845  8 ) entertainment ( live band , dj , photo booth ) # 682 $ 792  9 ) groom and groomsmen 's outfits # 674 $ 782  10 ) bridesmaids ( shoes , dress , make up , hair , accessories ) # 582 $ 676 there 's a lot of pressure around weddings , and a huge industry has sprung up around them to take advantage . 
  herman van rompuy is no charlemagne . 
  he 's not even a habsburg . 
  on the positive side , he has n't got the look only 6 generations of careful inbreeding could produce . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of people out there who are engaged and saving for the actual wedding . 
  people spend years saving so they can spend big . 
  i 've spoken with people from all over europe and all over the usa , and a lot of the time i see this topic come up it 's from euro centrics assuming the usa and europe are worlds apart and it 's simply not the case . 
  there are differences but they 're vastly smaller than what we have in common . 
  what about italy , croatia , greece or the multitude of other nations in europe ? 
  sure we share much in common with northern europe what about the rest of europe ? 
  i 'd expect we would have more in common with certain us states than others too . 
  i think it comes down to the cost of maintaining them . 
  fucking brits , they ruined britain . 
  are there many places in italy where drinkable water is more expensive than alcohol ? 
  `` we built this shitty resort for people to come and get drunk and fuck about , and i 'm absolutely outraged that people are visiting here just to get drunk and fuck about ! '', 
  jesus christ that 's one of the funniest things i 've seen on this website it donkeys . 
  i 'm struggling not to burst into a fit of tears and laughter . 
   maybe i wrong them but i really seems that they oppose any obligation that comes with being a memeber of the eu while taking all the benefits for granted why do you think this ? 
  poor forgotten prussia . 
  those hunger strikes really took their toll . 
  i use my / r/polandball flair as quite often there is little difference between the subs . 
  ( i love both ) it also reminds frenchy who 's running the show around here . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  i do n't really understand what 's wrong with sex ed in the uk . 
  it 's not really complicated is it . 
  i 'm 28 , and as far as school taking a roll i remember an assembly when i was 10 or 11 going over the basics and one in year 7 or 8 with a naked woman walking out of a shower . 
  i think boys and girls had these separately . 
  how much time or effort can you really be expected to spend teaching kids what they need to know ? 
  just so i 'm clear i 'm not defending it , i just do n't understand how it could be improved . 
  the uk leaving europe is a big deal , people are going to talk about how x , y , z might have an effect on any referendum results until the day the referendum happens . 
  not talking about it is n't going to make it go away . 
  people might want to talk about how there might be pressure on the judges to rule in the uk 's favour as to not arm any anti eu campaign in europe with more material . 
  tl ; dr there might be a referendum regarding british membership of the eu , people are going to mention it . 
  you 're responding to an innocent observation/comment by getting your knickers in a twist complaining about something that is n't happening . 
  last time i checked , / u/dimreaper was n't an elected representative of the uk neither did s/he make any threat , just an observation on how a ruling might affect any future referendum . 
  do n't get your knickers in a twist . 
  london is one of the most important cities in the world in both business and culture , i 'm not really all that surprised . 
  the only city that can compete is new york . 
  i doubt the numbers have been isolated purely to account for tourism . 
  i 'd expect if those numbers were taken paris would pull ahead . 
  i think putting foreigners in positions of high authority or influence will just make the case for nationalism even more popular , especially if there 's not a near instant improvement . 
  greece has a right to govern itself , and the greece should be able to take measures in order to safeguard itself , even if it means damaging the `` european project '' shorterm . 
  my point was all governments have probably used geopolitics , but i do n't see how the porn ban fits in as an example . 
  i think you 're thinking of the `` new deal '' under president roosevelt rather than the marshall plan . 
  someone still has to pay for the large social works , and greece does n't have enough control to take it on alone . 
  he let 's the tea bag touch milk , which makes him an outcast . 
  the tea bag must never touch milk , not under any circumstances . 
  i think you have misunderstood , he 's saying portugal could have lost it 's independence without england 's help , rather than saying `` won it with the help of england . '', 
  that 's a bit circlejerky . 
  the british government does actively use distractions to bury `` bad news '' , and has probably used international issues to distract from domestic . 
  the porn filter is a domestic issue , as is the widespread spying , are you suggesting gibraltar has cropped up in an effort to buty these issues ? 
  the spitfire was designed and developed in southampton , it was also one of the origins of the d-day invasions . 
  as long as he does n't start eyeing up my tea i think we can peacefully coexist . 
  you 're forever tainted now , i honestly ca n't bare to look at you . 
  just realised that france did n't pass our population until 1985 . 
  i always assumed france always had a higher population as long as france and the uk had existed .

  [ help help i 'm being repressed ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lhloxgf74h1qaxxvao1_400.gif ), 
  is n't that because so few germans own their homes ?
