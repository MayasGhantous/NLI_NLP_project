  69 % of britons vs 42 % of germans in 2002 . 
  they 're british citizens . 
  what does it matter if they fall into the overseas territories and not either scotland , england , or wales ? 
  if what he went through happened to be i 'm not sure i would manage to stay sane , no amount of compensation is going to give him back those years he missed out on . 
  terrifying, 
  oh pretty cool that they 're still being used outside the us marine corp. 
  so i guess that ship is a slightly bigger more modern invincible class style carrier . 
  that 's a helicopter carrier , if we wanted one in gibraltar we would send hms illustrious with a few seakings . 
  and as for annoying neighbours , yeah anyone with access to the sea `` appreciates '' the spanish fishing fleets . 
  well the spanish are irrelevant , and if gibraltarians want to continue to be defended by the british , they will have to accept that military hardware , nuclear or not will use the facilities there for a number of reasons . 
  if french culture was valuable it would survive on its own , given no outside pressure to exterminate it . 
  let it 's values and it 's tradition `` convert '' people , not the threat of force . 
  culture should be allowed to evolve , as time passes . 
  the french establishment seem obsessed with preserving it free of any influence , the same with the french language itself . 
  i ca n't imagine it 's under threat of extermination ... 
  [ these ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier ), 
  with you until your tldr . 
  i just thought napoleon would be viewed with more embarrassment . 
  yeah , but he was a tyrant and he lost . 
  why is napoleon considered an epic hero ? 
  there 's no benefit to learning foreign languages for 99 % of the population . 
  languages should be removed from the curriculum . 
  the financial crisis seems to have given birth to the idea that if you 're not physically creating stuff to sell for mass consumption , you 're not going to make any money . 
  conquering europe is a french/german hobby . 
  we just like to own places we can park our ships . 
  you 've not even been a democracy for 40 years yet , give it a chance . 
  no deal . 
  someone should tell the french . 
  the british indian army took part in the italian campaign in europe . 
  pfft we could have restarted a grand tradition of rivalry had you not gone soft and built the basis for the eu . 
  and our homosexuals are classier and more attractive than french homosexuals . 
  take that . 
  the `` race '' before the germans showed up and ruined the fun . 
  do n't overstep the line frenchman , remember who won . 
  i 'm amazed you managed to avoid striking/rioting/protesting long enough to pull it off !, 
  [ though you did have a nice old protest as soon as you were finished . 
  why ca n't we ? 
  an honest question , if everyone else just turned around and said that they 're on their own from september 1st 2014 what 's to stop us ? 
  i do n't really feel a moral obligation to `` stick around '' and sort a mess out that my ancestors created . 
  especially when they riot over a flag , or where they can march , or because someones marching etc etc etc. 
  i feel sorry for the people over there who are not turnip brained muppets , but the situation is beyond fucking stupid . 
  the north would celebrate ? 
  they 're not even remotely similar situations . 
  i know man , but it just seems like cutting them off and saying `` that 's enough of this shit '' would be the way to go . 
  wish we could have a referendum in the rest of the uk to just abandon n.ireland . 
  i 'd comment similarly on all you contributions if you brigading is the issue here , the issue is this post has no relevance to / r/europe . 
  it 's irrelevant , if you have any more issues i suggest you present them to / r/shitstatistssay . 
  current events vs a tv show . 
  right , but we play games in europe , we watch football in europe and we takes showers too . 
  lets not fill the subreddit with mindless irrelevant bollocks . 
  what has this got to do with / r/europe ? 
  you only know what has been disclosed regarding germany 's efforts . 
  i do however concede that there is a difference between how the french government and the british / american government views the legality of the operations if the le monde is correct . 
  it 's a breaking story and i 'm sure it , and more revelations about the intelligence community in each nation will come spilling out over the next few weeks . 
  france spys at home and abroad . 
  does it matter how many peoples communications are being monitored without oversight ? 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/04/us-france-security-idusbre9630fs20130704?feedtype=rss&amp;feedname=topnews&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;dlvrit=992637 ) look at the breaking news about the `` french prism '' from le monde . 
  germany spys on it 's own citizens , but might not have the infrastructure to do much outside it 's own territory , who knows . 
  in 2 days we might hear more about germany 's `` prism '' . 
  who 's we ? 
  france ? 
  there 's plenty of sense in the comments in here to be fair . 
  most of them better and more polite than mine . 
  with / r/europe still being pretty small the circlejerk has n't poisoned every comment thread . 
  i do n't think he should come , cap in hand to `` explain '' his nations actions . 
  in no way would that improve the situation , it would either a ) help stifle discussion b ) deflect criticisms away from the real issue ( the spying ) to why the us president is acting subservient to europe in us media . 
  and like it or not , the only people will be able to change the situation are the us population and their representatives . 
  it 's up to the british and their representatives to put and end to it , and the french , and the germans etc etc. 
   stop kissing us butt , uk . 
  predicable and boring , fuck off . 
  i am not the uk , and this is n't polandball . 
  the us president does n't give a fuck what the eu parliament thinks or wants . 
  he can explain himself to the presidents and prime ministers of europe if he even feels the need . 
  it 's pure unadulterated bollocks to even suggest that a democratically elected head of state from another continent present himself to explain . 
  if europe has a problem with how the usa has behaved it can grow a pair and take action against it . 
  but it wo n't because uk , france , germany have all been involved on spying on their own citizens and in the case of uk and france on allies . 
  but yeah we can turn this into `` lol poodle '' since well , that 's what many people believe . 
  why are they not summoning the british primeminister to talk to the european parliament , he french president , the german primeminister ? . 
  the big players in europe do n't want to talk about the skeletons in their own closets , it 's about focusing the attention on the nsa and gchq because the spotlight is already there . 
  if everyone paid a little more attention to what their own governments were doing , we would n't need to start summoning heads of state to answer questions on other continents and in other parliaments and we 'd get more done, 
  he 's not accountable to the european parliament , so he should n't come . 
  any explanation should be done in front of americans on american soil . 
  it 's just moving the light away from european leaders and institutions that have been practising the same thing , but with a smaller budget . 
  well happened to half of us , the other half were not as lucky and ended up in the soviet sphere of influence . 
  just so you 're aware , neoliberal has posted this comment thread to / r/shitstatistssay in an attempt to swing the conversation . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shitstatistssay/comments/1h6fr3/nutcase_statist_trying_to_defend_massive_farming/ ), 
  the german government has also been involved in the creation of [ trojans ] ( http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/10/09/government-backdoor-trojan-chaos/ ) . 
  a point where the people of europe could be working together to use the eu for good and here we are , pointing fingers . 
   it 's sarcasm , dude . 
  i do n't really believe that uk is an illegal institution . 
  that should have been pretty easy to pick up . 
  sorry it 's hard to tell , there are some people who believe very strange things on reddit . 
   it does n't have accent from the people ? 
  not according to opinion polls here in the uk . 
  if we get some stuff in the eu sorted and have our referendum it 's likely going to be a close run thing . 
   it will be bullied if it leaves . 
  yes , and it will likely be bullied if it opts for ever closer union . 
  for a large nation in europe the uk already showed how futile its efforts are when dealing with the proposed transaction tax , at least as it is we can put our foot down and say no . 
  there 's so many problems with europe , and the uk 's position within it that it 's very hard to decide on which part of the knot we should be working on first . 
  i think the uk should do everything in it 's power to stop itself being positioned in a way that they have to choose the lesser evil .
