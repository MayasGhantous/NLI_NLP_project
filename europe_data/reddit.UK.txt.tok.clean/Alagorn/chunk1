ireland always had the least mainstream professions . 
  the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  i wish we got more recognition for our contributions . 
   ** german ** frankfurters as opposed to ? 
  really ? 
  so why are foreigners getting fishing rights here if there 's supposedly an `` overfishing '' problem ? 
  having more people fish here in our waters defeats the point of it . 
   to me such an argument sounds like the argument of a climate change denier who wants his country to leave the eu to get rid of climate regulations to rebuild whatever polluting industry they get paid by . 
  of course you 'd like to think everyone who does n't think as you do is a raving lunatic . 
  so if wanting less regulations on fishing is just being a raving lunatic , then why does alex salmond and the snp also want the same regulations relaxed and stopping our fishing industry being destroyed ? 
  does he deny climate change too ? 
  we do n't get a chance to reform . 
  i thought the whole point of leaving was to change things . 
  there 's no evidence we 'll get our fishing industry back if we stay . 
  the irony is that we 've lost the very sort of muslim that shows the very best of muslims but this murder also indicates there is a long term problem with people not wanting to integrate in this country and muslims ready to kill over any kind of acknowledgement of other religions by muslims , perhaps almost close to apostate . 
  nothing will change . 
  islam will continue getting a free pass , muslims will continue to fear community cohesion under pain of death , the lefty liberals will continue calling critics of the religion racists . 
  yeah , he was , as it happened . 
  i thought most europeans learnt english to talk to each other . 
  let them get massacred , but god forbid they offend someone 's fee fees . 
  what next ? 
  attacking jews for `` bullying nazis '' ? 
  nice . 
  they can change the uk 's one when we get proportional representation . 
  i think it 's only including eu members and not smaller constituents . 
  i 'll also imagine transport for london sources employees from places outside of london , and even tower hamlets !!!??? 
  shocker !!!!!!, 
  what the fuck does this racist shit think transport for london is ? 
  a local cooperative ? 
   khan just lost my vote . 
  i was n't going to vote for labour regardless , but it 's dumbass shits like him who pushes people towards the moronic tories . 
  now i do n't want to vote for anyone . 
  [ please , sir , i want some moor ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=szrgxhvnnuc ), 
  not really, 
   any argument based on `` what the eu has done for us '' can simply be answered by `` but the uk could easily do that on its own '' . 
  so other than that type of argument , what are the positives of being in the eu ? 
  i would like certain things signed into uk law , like redistributing london n investment into the rest of the country and the eu 's laws on privacy and how the internet should be run , so microsoft having to accommodate other browsers for instance and not force ie, 
  now they 've had terrorists attack them they can do anything they like . 
  good luck calling them offensive or `` racist '' . 
   they saw a bunch of people doing nazi salutes and they assumed they were fascists ? 
  i 'm doing one right now , does that make me one now ? 
  quite a lot of people do n't see why `` irish '' has to always mean republican/nationalist so are fine with being `` irish '' . 
  the only reason anyone wouldnt is if they think it connotes republic/reunification support . 
  but before the partition unionists called themselves irish/ulsterman . 
  i guess the whole `` norn iron '' has a charm to it . 
  i doubt it , considering the people doing it are loyalists , who are extremists . 
  my belfast housemate likes england more because there were n't people gearing for a fight all the time over this issue, 
  maybe all muslims hate muslims ? 
  [ diplomatic immunity ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=h6vswcs7d1w ), 
  i thought this happened because of really awful shitty areas and indoctrination in the area . 
  it 's a good experiment to show why you do n't say `` let the public vote on names '' but i 'll be disappointed if they do a 180 and do n't use the top ranked name . 
  checkmate , you ca n't pander to this idiot ** and ** want turkey to join the eu/give turkey visa free travel in the eu . 
  i had a school trip to santander and a local village . 
  was pretty cool . 
  there was a medieval fete going on as well . 
  hostal even had it 's own swimming pool as well . 
  result !, 
   main one is referring to scots as english . 
  most scots have the same anglo-saxon/celtic ancestry as the english though . 
  the most traffic i see on that is on the queen 's drive before it , whereas the ones from old town and town centre is usually smooth enough . 
  the top two exits are always clear because very few people go that way and going from the top left to the middle right , queens drive , is easy . 
  the fourth reich would be a great name . 
  they 're only congested if there 's a disproportionate number of cars using primarily one exit rather than the other one to two exits . 
  most people do n't even know the eu has n't signed off their accounts for over a decade . 
  til bombing civilians gets you a nobel peace prize, 
  yes . 
  romeo and juliette . 
  none . 
  english is the only language we need . 
  not american english either , ** actual ** * english *, 
  rekt, 
  they had a huge war plus they were kind 've forced together whereas the british isles everyone has the same celtic/anglo-saxon mixed heritage and frankly the differences between catholicism and protestantism is laughable . 
  the only reason there were conflicts was because the normans set up plantations and wanted to milk ireland , none of this would 've happened if they simply annexed ireland and treated it like scotland or england or wales . 
  but yeah , you 're right that technically being the same sovereign state as your neighbour does n't always make you very close . 
  i guess its an anomaly here with the uk / irish relationship . 
  there 's divides over historical actions and events but at the same time we are drawn to each other and we do n't technically see each other as foreign . 
  so basically you cant bring your unemployed kids on holiday anymore ? 
  you can easily get round those , they exist so yobs who live near the opposite community dont fuck them over as they pass by . 
  while in theory you can get around it , its more of a case of not being bothered to venture far from their route to wherever . 
  so for instance , someone might throw a brick through someone 's window if they pass their house but if they had to detour to get to said house they would n't bother . 
  to be fair , they were the same country . 
  people dont like freedoms restricted . 
  the mistake is letting in countries with vastly different gdp . 
  the baltic states definitely dont need borders with the west . 
  maybe she is true russian ? 
  it 's like they turned the old castle walls into a giant fridge magnet . 
  she sounds like geordie english accent to me . 
  i was n't really aware of such a local identity but i 'd imagine it 's harder to stand out when there 's a few thousand people . 
  it 's almost like what a mini city state from the past would be if it had remained independent . 
  i like to call it dr congo, 
   it is threatening to stop preventing them from going to england . 
  they are n't being prevented . 
  they 're walking through the tunnel and trying to board ferries all the time , presumably with no tickets . 
  well i guess its more the lack of people voting , in terms of the ep, 
  ec , european parliament, 
  we 've all done that, 
  [ reminds me of this ] ( https://camo.derpicdn.net/41b03946b35d50f006d22f56f9744fbd888bfb21?url=https%3a%2f%2fimages.encyclopediadramatica.se%2fthumb%2fb%2fb7%2fpatriot.jpg%2f480px-patriot.jpg ), 
  are you having a bubbly bath ? 
   farage criticizes collective failures of decisions made by cooperating states but the only solution he offers is a unilateral withdrawal from combined decision making . 
  there 's no guarantee of reform .
