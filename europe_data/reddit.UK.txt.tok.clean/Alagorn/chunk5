  nuclear war over a glorified rocket-propelled log ? 
  well it was tony blair , who also wanted us to use the euro and is in general incredibly condescending to anyone with a different view on the eu, 
  so how can turkey make them over here . 
  or are they just rabid dogs going to the richest english speaking country ? 
  well we 'll send them back to turkey then , which is where they were before they came to europe . 
  we are sending ourselves to the gas chambers by granting turkey visas , let alone eu memberships . 
  it 's precisely why we 're having a referendum in the uk in the first place . 
  their leader is forcing european countries to censor their media , such as the german video about erdogan . 
  stop obsessing to these morons . 
  we fit in culturally with sweden , denmark , germany , norway and netherlands but our geography puts us closer to france . 
  is there a way of doing that without sucking the ec off ? 
   quite to the contrary , most brits think the empire was something to be proud of . 
  ya i 'm still embarrassed we stopped slavery . 
  how pathetic, 
   i mean ... you used to have an empire ... 
  i forgot i have n't done my daily apology for specifically enslaving black people while ourselves have white skin . 
  the only war there will be a war for a monopoly on cruises . 
  oi 've go ' a bran ' new comboine ` arrrvesterrr !, 
  an ' oi 'll give yoo th ' key !, 
  i 'm not particularly religious , but i thought the lore was god does n't intervene ? 
  part of human free will . 
  i guess diseases contradicts the `` free will '' thing though . 
  we were planning on winning the war by waiting for them to die out, 
  can we just recognise that this entire ... thing about gibraltar , it 's sovereignty and whether the uk will go to war with spain is entirely manufactured by the media ? 
  i 'm fairly sure theresa may was asked what her response is to any claims on the rock , she used the falklands as an example because other than the fact it was invaded it 's the same scenario . 
  that said , whoever said `` we need to remind them who we really are '' is a moron and i 'm surprised the government is allowing the media to run away with this farce . 
  meanwhile , theresa may decides to moan about an easter egg hunt not saying `` easter '' in the event 's official branding , acting like they want to remove all christian mention from the event even though the website and information has `` easter '' written all over it . 
  so i have to wonder , does the government endorse this media manufacture of `` going to war with spain '' ? 
  is she just pissing around seeing how retarded she can be while remaining at 40 % in the polls ? 
  does this include kids of servicemen and women on military bases before returning to their parent 's country ? 
  rip, 
  london was an economic capital of an entity of more than $ 10 trillion and 500 million people , regardless how out of touch the city is to the rest of the country , it 's a position we 've thrown away, 
   and a far greater boon than a ** bane ** to it . 
  we merely adopted the common market . 
  i did n't know a generation in scotland was 3 years . 
  do n't forget the `` let 's either not not replace regional funding or flip flop over it '' even then the whole point is proving we can manage without being in the eu . 
  everything was fine before when we listened and believed , we do n't need discourse or the government to listen to its people . 
  there was totally no issues that were n't being ignored !, 
  why do n't they just take the eu citizenship offer like the man said we 'd get ? 
  while it 's just eu headquarters , we should 've seen this coming because regardless of international banking a company will want it 's eu headquarters in the eu . 
  was n't legal to gas jews in france, 
  i do commend them for their `` legs-it '' response . 
  the fact they 're women , being mocked by a woman , is completely irrelevant to the issue of sexism when people do all sorts of things with men too . 
  having said that , is that not meant to read '' ... an historic ... '' ? 
   never knew that people were so afraid of a unified germany . 
  tbh the last time you were unified you did gas the jews and take over the whole continent . 
  they claim responsibility for anything, 
  i 'm surprised this needed any help . 
  it 's literally just a guy , one knife and his car . 
  no hijacking , no bombs , no guns . 
  he probably would n't even need to look at a map to choose where to drive . 
  i guess he had persuasion to do this, 
  it kind of sucks they waited until after we voted to leave the eu , now there 's one less thing to scaremonger with . 
  even from a pro-independence standpoint i 'd wait and see how bad it gets to maximise leave vote potential . 
  even sargon , who is anti-eu as opposed to just eurosceptic like me , thinks some of geert wilders 's aims infringes on people 's civil rights . 
  he really needs to tone it down . 
  by who ? 
  one person ? 
  nice to see this will be a gender neutral thing and not archery at all, 
   `` a remnant of nazis '' it 's a bit rich coming from him . 
  because of that google bomb i always think of justin beiber when someone says syphilis, 
  ah well that makes sense, 
  must have been very rich, 
  what about all the jews he did n't help because they were too poor ? 
   to prevent to children from crying and alerting patrols , they would make them drink spirits to pass out . 
  sounds like he was running the party boat, 
  they all look the same to me, 
  for mythic plus raids, 
  yeah i only really have an issue with hypocrites . 
  these guys are n't , and their designs are amazing . 
  scotland would be the ones putting up barriers with their biggest trading partner . 
  everything else is just virtue signaling . 
  i voted to remain in the eu , but please people use common sense when talking about this, 
  \\ #makefrancenordicagain, 
  american call it a hamburger , probably because of hamburg ? 
  but in the uk it would sound like topping for the burger , like `` cheese burger '' or perhaps the type of meat `` beef burger '' or `` chicken burger '', 
  fairly sure vikings settled in north east scotland too, 
  jesus , so he 's not even someone you can look up to as a leader of europe if he 's going to be so pessimistic about the eu ? 
   so it 's not a jewish only problem it affects anyone who ** is n't part of the eu or russian ** til russia is part of the eu . 
  lol do they really think the us will want to bargin with russia over snowden ? 
  it 's not even worth it . 
  they wo n't remove sanctions because they got their little cuckold back . 
  and even so does trump want to arrest him even though he only attacked obama 's government ? 
   you know in the old days we would simple ask sombody where we would find it . . 
  in the old days you could legally rape your spouse , so your argument is invalid, 
  i 'm convinced they hate my country . 
  forget those anti-brexit judges , the fact the government throws away every opportunity we have to lead an industry - or become a major player - makes them the enemies of the people . 
  forget king of the ashes , they do n't want to lead anything apart from a suicide jump, 
  the helvetica scenario ? 
  so many 2010 lib dem voters dropped them the moment they went into coalition with the tories if they 'd just stick with them they couldve been in the opposition or in coalition with labour instead of below ukip in popularity, 
   unless you want to complain about how the media is treating corbyn they 're kind of done with corbyn though . 
  could be him not revolting against brexit, 
  can definitely agree there . 
  i think you get the occasional disagreement to gender wage gap in / r/unitedkingdom but the views of its users are mainly leaning in one direction . 
  that said , politicly the conservatives and labour are a laughing stock so it 's kind of difficult to find some nuance there . 
  i 'm fairly sure i 've had a dream about that railway terminal . 
   going back to albainia it seems that they did whatever rome asked , and when invaded rome would send their army to help defend . 
  so nato ? 
  how many chinese it take to replace a lightbulb ? 
  except the british empire which just made everything independent .
