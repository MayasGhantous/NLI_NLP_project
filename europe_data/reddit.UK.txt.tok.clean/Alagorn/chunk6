  the actual components are still going strong and still using the same infrastructure , legal systems etc. 
  you could argue that having a central power failed though . 
  oh and i forgot our african territories . 
  they 've gone to shit . 
  oh right , so le penn wins then ? 
  you decide, 
  i wonder why ... ? 
  they do that so they know who to persecute, 
  how are n't we an ethnic group ? 
  we all have the same anglo saxon celtic genes, 
  better than taking off and nuking the site from orbit just to make sure , though, 
  it 's pretty pathetic by terrorist standards . 
  an old man with a bin lorry killed six people in glasgow and he was n't even trying . 
  ** edit : ** okay , not so pathetic , nine people died . 
  rip :( ** edit 2 : ** and over fifty people were hit by it :(, 
  i do n't think they would do that now, 
  would n't have happened if westminster had control . 
  i think the germans need to pull back some of these rules . 
  i mean a swastika is one thing but a salute ? 
  such cringe . 
  ... fucker of daario ... 
  did n't germany pay any kind of `` reparation '' while it was partitioned and occupied ? 
   looks like i 'm wrong on turkey . 
  does n't mean they ca n't be the haradrim/easterlings . 
  well we kicked them out, 
  wow !, 
  mordor lines up perfectly on this map !, 
  i suppose any important figure . 
  like we just put churchill on the # 5 and he 's a symbol of the second world war . 
  unlikely anyone else would be able to be seen as objectively good in a similar manner . 
  but i doubt we 'd put thatcher on there or any lesser prime minister . 
  what was the end game ? 
  was it to incense the german people into committing another genocide ? 
  i guess / r/england is so small anyone could tip the balance . 
  if only piracy was n't illegal , i 'd be able to pirate movies and tv shows for free ... 
  it 's how it 's abused . 
  it 's how the external borders are n't protected . 
  it 's who was let into the club . 
  how is it delusional ? 
  we 're leaving because so much is non-negotiable . 
  i do n't think we need to worry about the poles investing in gassing people - they already have the infrastructure - and they got it for free from germany . 
  i find it a bit of a coincidence tbh . 
  stat strong poland . 
  do n't let these cunts bully you into something . 
  they 're trying to destroy it again . 
  and the uk is getting the hate for some reason . 
  yeah what is it with people of anglo-saxon and celtic decent committing terrorist attacks ? 
  such a pathetic trend . 
  `` alternative warning '', 
   if there 's not a medical reason ( phimosis etc ) frankly i would just call that amputation to avoid letting the pro-circumcision people claim a benefit of it . 
  the falkland islanders are the indigenous people of the falklands, 
  it makes me cringe when i hear that rhetoric . 
  there 's so many people in england and scotland with cross border relations that it 's practically like splitting off half your country for little reason ( i mean granted it is because of the behaviour the the government but the people do n't want to be split up ), 
   mauritius is just as willing to continue the arrangement with us . 
  kind of odd considering the treatment of the locals was as a result of the us getting involved . 
  i think this is the key thing here . 
  we simply do n't care about it . 
  we 're not really losing anything as a result of this . 
  you can also argue that no-one would 've been displaced if it remained fully british controlled but as far as i 'm concerned we ceded that control to someone else . 
  we need to demonise the people who do this . 
  make them feel ashamed for their savagery . 
  if anyone thinks it 's acceptable then they belong in a gas chamber frankly . 
  if anyone takes issue with that they need to sort out their priorities . 
  do it in your own country, 
  i was typing on my phone so i missed it . 
  i 'm on my pc now though . 
  i meant to put a question mark at the end . 
  london is the sixth largest french city right !, 
   the nice attacker was tunisian . 
  how do you know what his personality was like ? 
  i think we might be a bit too big to be in a nordic union , we 'd dominate it like how england dominates the areas with less than 5 million people . 
   denmark are more eurosceptic they must join with us !, 
   i think he ought to be paying a little more attention to thinking about brexit negotiations . 
  that 's what i 'm doing , to make sure we get the best possible deal for britain . 
  surely she can have a break from that for a week ? 
   representing his delusions of royalty admit it , you 'd do it too if you were swimming in yolo money . 
  ironic, 
  the absolute state of germany and italy, 
   publicise job adverts for ` non-white applicants only ' . 
  you mean the scriptwriters ? 
  that was a trainee scheme rather than a job . 
  not saying i disagree with your view on this but they used that as their excuse . 
  see i would n't mind if it 's just some dumb shit or a play or a joke , but if they 're playing it straight it makes no sense . 
  in before `` actually the way they spoke english was different then as well '' . 
  pretty dank, 
  i 'd love to see the ec try and crash poland 's economy with fines or sanctions . 
  so much for unity , right ? 
  * autistic screeching *, 
  dunedin, 
  lauren southern is helping do this . 
  why ca n't everyone else ? 
  why is it ok to endorse people smuggling all of a sudden ? 
  you realise a pandora 's box was opened last year, 
  was it a heavy defeat ? 
  why quit over this ? 
  we probably have people training there still anyway , as opposed to active duty or protecting anything like a typical deployment, 
  you never know , maybe he * does * want to gas the jews . 
  bearing in mind this is a party with the third most votes on the uk after labour and the conservatives, 
   2 ) in ireland , women form the majority of students in top universities ( 60/40 in trinity college , ranked 1st in ireland ) , and also progress to third level at a higher rate than men ( i did a dissertation on this in college ) . 
  as a result there are more academically qualified women than men .
