  that 's not to say that germans do not engineer some machines worthy of deep admiration , just that there 's too much hype around their products these days . 
  i have had the opportunity to attend dozens of trade fairs across the uk and europe over the past three years . 
  in that short space of time it 's become quite apparent to me that german manufacturers across a number of fields drag out the old ` german engineered ' label when the facts and figures do n't stack up in their favour against foreign competitors . 
  the machine i played a very small part in designing recently bests anything in the world at the moment . 
  i 'm really proud of it , and the statistics , operation history and general feedback all point to it being better than anything manufactured in germany at this moment in time . 
  despite that , at the last few trade fairs i 've been to our german competitors have been acknowledging that our machines are very good , but then arguing that as it 's not made in bavaria it surely ca n't be as good or trusted . 
  lol , what ? 
  they 're not the only german company guilty of this , though . 
  it seems to be pandemic , which is a great shame as it 's only going to tarnish their reputations . 
  it 's late and i 'm obviously ranting , but the message i 've been working to is this : - germans should explore other facets of germany to be proud of . 
  too much emphasis is placed on engineering , and from where i 'm standing it looks like the rug could be pulled out from beneath their feet to some degree in the near future . 
  there 's a lot to be proud of in germany , not just manufacturing .

  come on ... you 're better than that . 
  i was going to challenge this point right up 'til i saw the estelada . 
  i can only apologise , really . 
  i know first hand what it 's like to have your region turned into a minefield of foreign drunkards . 
  fucks everybody off , especially the elderly , and the resulting mess is a bloody nightmare . 
  crime shoots up and formerly nice neighbourhoods are ruined . 
  are english migrants as bad as the tourists ? 
  [ that reminds me .

  at 16 you can ride a moped with anything up to a 50cc engine . 
  at 17 you can ride a moped or motorcycle with anything up to a 125cc engine . 
  i do n't believe young car drivers are subjected to engine displacement restrictions , however ; i got my first car at 17 and that had a 2,522 cc block . 
  i also had a crappy peugeot moped when i was 16 . 
  it was so **** i let my friends shoot it and set it on fire . 
  that 's certainly the case for the company i work for . 
  i used to commute to and from nearest europe with eurostar on a fairly regular basis prior to october/november 2015 . 
  the delays we experienced last autumn were a bloody nightmare , so we 've since used london city airport and have found the resident airlines ( cityjet in particular ) to be very reliable and accommodating . 
  i used to enjoy the train journeys , but when the delays became a regular occurrence we cut our losses . 
  we 're also finding that many of the clients and contractors we 'd have typically met in either brussels or paris are now insisting we conduct business in london . 
  american and east asian clients are particularly insistent , which i think is down to a perception in these countries/regions that the uk is a safer place to work from . 
  i 'm not going to comment on whether that 's silly or not , though they do almost always express their concern regarding that matter . 
  yeah , that 's pretty much his sole redeeming quality . 
  here in lincolnshire the indigenous population and e.european migrant population regularly exchange xenophobic slurs . 
  i guess our ridiculously high house prices significantly impact our ranking . 
  massive polish diaspora helps , too . 
  i 'm bloody impressed that there were enough poles still sober enough to submit a legible vote .

  damn , son !, 
  now you 're talking !, 
  i have family in the usa ; my cousin owns a cadillac cts-v wagon which he let me drive through the middle of nowhere the last time i visited . 
  easily the most powerful car i 've ever driven , and the concept of owning such a versatile , high performance vehicle really appeals to me . 
  if i lived in the usa i 'd either own one or be saving for one . 
  i 'm thinking of selling my audi s3 later this year . 
  i had n't given it much thought until i saw one parked outside the local ford dealership , but if i can find a ` nearly new ' mustang gt within my price range i 'd be tempted to bite . 
  hehe . 
  i have a terrible sense of direction , so it would have helped me greatly to have climbed up people to get an idea of where i was . 
  i kept having to return to the meuse to gather my bearings , as the city 's layout was a little confusing for a day or two . 
  beautiful place , though . 
  i am in favour of the uk leaving the eu and shall be voting as such in the june referendum . 
  whilst i believe a uk outside the eu best suits my interests and quality of life , i believe the eu deserves a great deal more praise than it 's currently receiving . 
  i certainly would n't take any pleasure in witnessing the disintegration of the eu , but if the citizens of member state ` xxxxxx ' decided the best course of action was to leave the eu , it 'd be hypocritical of me not to wish them success . 
  i want a nice standard of living . 
  whether you 're from bordeaux ; gothenburg ; lublin ; rotterdam or vilnius , it does n't matter . 
  i want you to also have a life that suits your requirements , regardless of whether that may be within or outside of the eu . 
  what works for me might not work for you . 
  yes , i understand the importance of genetics . 
  my father is 1.98 m and my mother is 1.85 m. 
  i 'm 1.93 m and my brother is 2.03 m , whilst my sisters are 1.85 m , 1.88 m and 1.96 m. 
  we did n't get that tall from munching on cheddar and downing pints of milk one after the other . 
  however , i think diet plays a part in explaining why the dutch grow more than the rest of us . 
  i think i 'm correct in saying that until the latter half of the 19th century , the dutch were amongst the shortest people on the continent . 
  to me that suggests that they 're no more genetically predisposed to become tall than any other ethnic group in europe . 
  this pun deserves recognition . 
  all three of my sisters are either dating or married to shorter men , though with their heights ranging between 1.85 m - 1.96 m , it 's quite understandable . 
  fetch cheese and milk ... and lots of it . 
  i 'm surprised the dutch average is ` only ' 1.84 m. 
  i recently visited a relative who lives near maastricht ; at 1.93 m i felt fairly average . 
  here in the uk ( well , in my locale ) there 's a distinct ` height gap ' between the generations . 
  i 'd say most pensioners are around the 5 ' 8 '' ( 1.73 m ) mark ; most middle aged men are around the 5 ' 10 '' ( 1.78 m ) mark ; most lads in their early 20s are around 6 ' 0 '' ( 1.83 m ) . 
  [ frankie & benny 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankie_%26_benny%27s ) my parents very rarely took me to fast food restaurants as i was growing up ( exception being the visit to the fish & chip shop on the first friday of every month ) , so for me there 's still a novelty to visiting burger bars etc. 
  however , frankie & benny 's is certainly a place i 'd steer clear of . 
  the food is as forgettable as you 'd expect , but that 's not my gripe . 
  you do n't expect a decent meal at a place that only serves defrosted grub . 
  however , the uninterrupted 1950s rock and roll music they blare out whilst you 're eating was enough to drive me up the wall . 
  if i ever hear bill haley 's comets ever again , there 's no telling what i 'll do .

  [ land of hope and glory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tw0qqit2lu ) ok , it 's a song rather than a video , but it still stirs me . 
  i think that even if the song means nothing to you , the music can still be enjoyed . 
  as a bostonian i have to disagree with you to the utmost degree . 
  i lived in the town until i turned 17 , at which point my parents decided it was best to relocate the family to a small village a few miles to the north for our safety . 
  we lived in a typical middle-class neighbourhood which prior to 2006/2007 had been the perfect location to raise a family . 
  the streets were quiet and crime was almost non-existent . 
  for me personally the turning point was marked one evening when i was walking home from school . 
  i was approaching the end of my street and heard one of my neighbours shouting for help . 
  i ran over , and slumped in her holly bush was a poor polish guy who had been stabbed by his girlfriend just moments earlier . 
  thank god he survived , but i had never seen the likes of this beforehand . 
  as more and more migrants from latvia , lithuania and poland flooded in to the town , violent crimes became increasingly commonplace . 
  [ only last week a lithuanian man i go to the gym with was stabbed by his girlfriend and members of her family .
