*** very *** common in fact . 
  if you live in the countryside , the chances are you 're going to be eating rabbit fairly frequently , or at least that 's been my experience . 
  yes , we used to occasionally have them at primary school , as well as drills for bomb scares . 
  never got anything along the same lines at secondary school or uni though . 
  scum , domestic terrorists . 
  a bunch of middle-class bourgeois kids with daddy issues , violently and somehow unironically demanding anarchy and/or communism ( arguably the evilest ideology in history ) . 
  delusional fools who 've completely disregarded the stated ` purpose ' of their group and are themselves , fascists . 
  all in all , they 're violent , delusional criminals , and frankly , if * national action * was proscribed by the uk government , i do n't see why antifa should n't be - when it comes down to it , the two groups have the same aims , just different prejudices , and both of those aims include violence , property damage , sedition and coercion . 
  tinker tailor soldier spy . 
  though i am biased as the book has always been my favourite too . 
  it could have been even better , but i can appreciate that to cut down a le carre novel for the big screen is no small task . 
  no , he/she means that you just pump the petrol yourself ( using a normal petrol pump ) . 
  in other countries , due to labour and safety laws , an attendant has to do it for you . 
  this is especially true in the us . 
  yes !, 
  loved the place , been there twice . 
  my aunt & subsequent cousins live in montreal and i visited them once 4 years ago , and last year i was in saskatoon for work purposes . 
  thoroughly enjoyed myself both times . 
  though i did prefer my time montreal and that time i was over there during the xmas period , so i got to enjoy the wonders of a proper canadian winter . 
  i know one the opposite way round . 
  the theme song to the film * 55 days at peking * . 
  the [ original is in english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dio9zhx5ty ) ( obviously ) , but in my opinion , it 's better in [ german ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyfisat8gs ) . 
  it 's actually a really ` good ' ( in that ` so bad it 's good ' kind of way ) old war movie , you should give it a watch if you ever get a chance . 
  best us president in recent history in my mind . 
  fantastic economic policy ( got ta love reaganomics ) , fantastic foreign policy ( especially in regards to dismantling the ussr ) and a golden era of us-uk relations , the likes of which we have n't seen since . 
  -- top notch !, 
  let 's put it this way ... 
  i avoid using public toilets here at all costs , i 'd rather not catch the bubonic plague thanks . 
  probably germany . 
  but british bread * is * underrated we do n't traditionally do fancy stuff , but if you 're looking for just top-notch quality , regular , no frills bread , there are very few places that can beat british bread , specifically a nice crusty white tin loaf or a hedgehog loaf .

  about a year ago , i was walking along through york city centre , on my way to a formal-ish social event , as such , i was dressed smartly ( tweed jacket , waistcoat , check-shirt , beige-ish slacks and brown shoes ) and i was stopped by a couple of chinese tourist groups who all wanted to take pictures of/with me . 
  one of their tour guides told me it was because they all thought i looked like a ` stereotypical english gentleman ' . 
  i thought this was especially odd seeing as it 's not too uncommon to see people dressed as i was , especially in york - perhaps it was something about my face ... 
   you do n't see how inflammatory and aggressive rhetoric can easily lead to more serious conflict ? 
  i previously stated that i understand that it * can * , but your original argument was that it will * always * lead to conflict , i 'm saying that you can be aggressive without belligerence and nations/nationalisms such as switzerland and japan prove that you 're wrong to make such a sweeping generalisation . 
   theres a direct correlation between all those things and the state of the economy . 
  the economy affects everything else far more than the other way round . 
  this is a fallacy because all of these factors ( including the economy ) contribute to each other , not just to the economy . 
  i will agree that economy is perhaps the most important of the competitive elements , it is not , however , the * only * one - as you were suggesting . 
   you ca n't truly believe in free market capitalism if you 're against globalisation . 
  they 're directly opposing . 
  no , this is just wrong . 
  again you 're confusing the two as one-in-the-same . 
  globalisation is simply one of many forms of free-market capitalism . 
  free-market capitalism is a concept which has existed for hundreds of years . 
  globalisation as a concept only emerged in the fallout of ww2 . 
  so , are you telling me that 19th century britain was a globalist state ? 
   if you think that the united states , trump or otherwise , is an anti globalisation country then you 're deluded . 
  japan is as well in the economic sense , to a lesser degree perhaps . 
  all big economies are , you ca n't be a big economy in today 's world without breaking down barriers to trade , one of the biggest ones being political borders . 
  you just do n't get it , do you ? 
  no , neither the us or japan are globalist states , you tell me where the us is looking for closer political union with its trading partners , yes it 's in nafta , but that 's a pretty tepid pact and i can guarantee that it 's not going to be advancing during a trump administration is it ? 
  also , please tell me when the us agreed to wind down its borders in the interests of free market capitalism ? 
  apart from a free market , what element of globalisation has japan embraced ? 
  it fiercely protects its own culture and political sovereignty and is part of no trade blocs , so no , it is absolutely not a globalist state . 
  i will repeat one more time for your benefit - ** it is entirely possible to be free-marketeer without being globalist and some of the most successful economies in the world fit into this category **  corbyn never did that lol even if you take his ` friends ' statement literally . 
  you do n't seem to know what pledging support actually is . 
  and his statement has been contexualised and makes sense , was friend a good word ? 
  maybe not , but it was a meeting , you 're gon na have to be diplomatic . 
  the uk has constantly supported saudi arabia for years know and they 're done things far worse . 
  i mean if actually describing a terrorist group as ` friends ' and holding secret appeasement talks with them is ` support ' i do n't know what the fuck is - especially when these people are absolutists and demand nothing but the degradation of britain and/or her allies - it is foolish to try to bargain with zealots . 
  plus he is allies and literally bedfellows with people who have actively stated their wish for the terrorists to acheive victory over britain - dianne abbot said in reference to the ira '' [ every defeat of the british state is a victory for all of us ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/diane-abbott-ira-regret-jeremy-corbyn-defeat-british-state-a7759926.html ) . '', 
  i do n't trust a political figure whose closest friends and allies say things like this - it tends to speak volumes about their own personal opinions . 
  in regards to saudi arabia , yeah i 'm in total agreement , it 's wrong . 
  but this is not a left or right issue . 
  both sides of the political scale have sold to the saudi 's on our behalf . 
  so you ca n't claim that labour 's hands are clean on this issue . 
   why is ` the union ' precious ? 
  you only like it due to sentimental reasons you were persuaded to take as fact . 
  the union is precious with and without sentimentality . 
  if the union were to break up , it would affect me economically and politically , it would shrink the national economy and would cause constitutional crises on an unprecedented scale . 
  - so why should we capitulate to terrorists whose idea of a united catholic ireland * truly is * based solely on sentimentality and a trumped-up dream that they 've been ` wronged ' and we need kicking out of ` their ' land for some reason . 
   so you 're taking pride in things you had no hand in doing/creating ? 
  no , i 'm admiring them and accepting that it should be my civic and moral duty to honour the sacrifices made by those people , by continuing to strive for their ideals to the best of my humble ability . 
   ok . and there are n't any values that your forebears laid down their lives for ( of which there are actually not that many occasions , with an obvious exception being ww2 ) , that are unique to the uk . 
  yes there are : * english liberties . 
  * english common law . 
  * our parliamentary democracy . 
  * our constitutional monarchy . 
  and what are you talking about `` not that many occasions '' ? 
  : * ww2 * ww1 * all 7 coalition wars against napoleon . 
  * spanish armada * the countless times france has tried to invade us . 
   infact most of those values came into being when one group of britons went into conflict with another . 
  take a guess as to what divided the two groups every time . 
  true . 
  but what divided these groups of britons was ** not ** nationalism , how can one be nationalist against one 's own countrymen unless you are part of a secession movement ? 
  in pretty much every case , what divided them was political opinion , i.e. 
  in the english civil war , it was between people who thought either parliament or the monarch should be sovereign . 
  so should we start banning and loathing simple political opinions too , y' know seeing as they cause conflict obviously ? 
  i update it every time i go to apply for a job ( to make sure it 's finely tuned for the role ) and also every 6 months otherwise . 
  the style i use is very formal and to the point . 
  having attended several job fairs and cv workshops during my time at uni , the suggestion i unanimously got was that employers like a professional document that just gets straight to the point - any fancy frills adds unnecessary and surplus information and makes it seem like you 're compensating for something . 
  i include these sections in this order : * contact details/address . 
  * personal statement ( includes ; achievements , skills , details of any training and experience , e.t.c. ) . 
  * education history . 
  * employment history . 
  * qualifications ( listed in a separate table for each qualification type , for me it 's ; gcse 's , a-levels , and then undergraduate degree ) . 
  * references . 
   if someone claims that their country 's inherently better than others , then yeah thats an aggressive statement .
