  i always thought it was really kind of stupid that americans think that the british are effeminate , seeing as we 're virtually indistinguishable as people , culturally speaking . 
  i was stopped by a pcso for cycling on the pavement when i was 13 - he phoned my mum and told her to give me a ` talking to ' . 
  he also said that if he saw me doing it again there would be more serious repercussions , probably was just lying as a scare tactic though . 
  yeah , there 's still a bunch of ww2 bunkers across the east coast of england , especially in my area as it was considered one of the prime locations for the germans to land an invasion force ( though it turned out they were planning to land somewhere completely different ) . 
  as a result , there are loads of disused fortified pillboxes and machine-gun nests all over the place around here . 
  also , most population centres have local civil defence force nuclear bunkers which were to be used as command facilities and shelter for those few lucky enough to have gotten a space . 
  the one in my town is under the library and is currently used for the storage of emergency supplies such as blankets , food rations , cots , medical products e.t.c in case of a local disaster . 
   the thing with roma people is ; they do n't try , and they actively do things to reinforce the negative views . 
  is n't that also kind of the case with a lot ( or at least , a visible minority ) of the muslim refugees as well though ? 
  to be honest , i think it 's a lost cause to everyone alive today , it 's going to take decades , perhaps centuries before their reputation is anything near recovered , and that 's if it even ever happens . 
  i severely doubt that anyone alive today will live to see it restored to normality . 
  also , i fear that if the migrant/refugee crisis continues along its current path , it will likely create an irreversible negativity towards islam and the middle east in general ( if it has n't already ) . 
  pis-party means something * entirely * different in english , and it 's illegal to make videos featuring one ... 
  well , from what you say , i can say with confidence that london seems like the best choice for you , and i 'm sure you 'd have a fantastic time !, 
  i can understand that fear , however , i think that you 're just going to have to accept that there 's pretty much an equal risk anywhere in western and some of central europe . 
  additionally , i can imagine that your media may have somewhat sensationalized or over-exaggerated the problem - although i do n't mean to downplay it as an issue , it definitely should be something you consider . 
  as for tickets , yes , you do have to buy them , though they are n't really expensive , all things considered . 
  they usually go on sale around mid-late october every year and take a month or two to sell out , so you would have a while to buy them . 
  very common in cities , i myself live in a city and cycle to work ( though i only live less than a mile from work ) . 
  a number of cities have also implemented public bike programmes , for example , london has the colloquially named ` boris bikes ' . 
  additionally , it is currently trying to make itself more cycle-friendly via the creation of the ` cycle superhighways ' ( basically just massive fast-track cycle routes cutting through london ) . 
  as a result of similar attitudes and changes across the country , cycling is undoubtedly becoming more and more popular . 
  in regards to e-bikes , i 've noticed that they 've only recently started to become relatively common-ish amongst regular cyclists . 
  however , i seem to feel that electrical assist cycles have always been seen as a bit of an ` old person ' thing . 
  london . 
  in most cases , i would advocate avoiding london like the plague . 
  however , in your circumstances ... london usually hosts one of , if not * the * worlds largest fireworks displays and the celebration is monumental in size . 
  also , the nightlife is somewhat world famous is it not ? 
  plenty of very well known clubs and hundreds , if not thousands more that you 'll have never heard of . 
  plus , seeing as london is going to be packed with people celebrating on new year 's eve , i 'd say the chances are that the clubbing/partying is going to be top-notch . 
  anecdote : i was supposed to go with some foreign ( mostly american ) friends last year , but i broke my collarbone in a somewhat foolish rugby-related incident two days beforehand . 
  when they came back they told me it was `` the best night of their lives '' e.t.c. ... 
  i was jealous to say the least . 
  i 'd say as a national characteristic , british people do tend to be punctual ( it is one of our stereotypes after all ) . 
  however , our train system has been crap since the 1950s . 
  while other european nations chose to invest in rail infrastructure in the fallout of ww2 , the uk did n't and only realised what a bad idea that was in the 1970s and 80s . 
  so now we 've been left with a rail network which is decades behind a lot of europe , however , it 's getting better at a fairly rapid rate . 
  `` after the fact '' is a turn of phrase which is simply meant to suggest a period of time after an event - in this case , their support during the campaign to join the euro . 
  from a british perspective , the pound has always been and continues to be better for us than the euro . 
  it 's pretty much a unanimously agreed on fact here that the uk is far better off without the euro . 
  the people who originally advocated for us joining the eurozone in the late 90s were roundly discredited after the fact and their economic credibility was cast into serious doubt . 
  grand canyon , monument valley , the rocky mountains , niagara falls , as well as both yellowstone and yosemite national parks . 
  all of these are the most notable off the top of my head and are all quite well known , featuring fairly frequently on many nature/natural world documentaries as well as on other tv shows here in the uk . 
  we have a few more than most people realise , still though , our list of dangerous animals is a little pathetic when compared with everywhere else . 
  we have : * ticks . 
  * stinging insects ; wasps , bees , hornets e.t.c. 
  * boars . 
  * a few different species of dangerous ( but not fatally so ) spiders . 
  also , there are plans to reintroduce wolves , lynx and also i believe that there are calls for the reintroduction of the brown bear . 
  additionally , there is currently a programme of reintroduction of more , larger populations of boar into more varied locations . 
  come to england , avoid the nauseating tourist trap that is london and enjoy the dramatic surroundings of autumn in the wild north . 
  i recommend the yorkshire dales or the lake district as long as you do n't mind the cold or getting a bit wet . 
  there really is some of the best and most dramatic scenery in all of europe up here , and in my opinion , it 's only enhanced by autumn and/or winter . 
  plus the people are super friendly and the pub culture is top-notch if you 're into that kind of thing . 
  i will also say , as a bit of a shout out to the germans here , and to make sure i 'm not coming across as biased - if england is n't your thing - it 's always been a dream of mine to head to germany during oktoberfest , i 've heard it 's a bloody good time . 
  usually , in the uk it is also recommended that a person visits their dentist once every 6 months . 
  however , despite us having the nhs , it 's generally not made compulsory and many people use private dentists instead . 
  this means that there is a massive variable between those who adhere to the 6-month recommendation and those who will only go for sporadic check-ups or whenever they have dental issues . 
  however , as anecdotal evidence , i know very few people who do n't go at least every 6 months , hence , i would cautiously argue that those who do are in the vast majority . 
  of course !, 
  my bad for forgetting that detail , thanks for pointing it out !, 
  i would have thought that , if you own one rough diamond , and can provide a reasonable explanation as to why you have it ( for instance , you inherited it and it was n't obtained through illegal or violent means - i.e. 
  it is n't a blood diamond ) , you should be okay , but it would be *** very *** advisable to find the relevant authority and notify them ahead of time just to make sure . 
  however , i would personally ** strongly ** advise against importing such an item into the uk , simply to avoid any possible complications at customs . 
  also , ** this law applies only to diamonds ** , ownership of any other gem , metal or mineral is legal in all their forms , as long as they are n't dangerous to public health ( i.e. 
  radioactive or severely poisonous . ), 
  i should clarify , there are no restrictions regarding the printing/publication of * legal * pornography , so you would n't get into trouble for possession of either physical or online pornography which you could otherwise legally watch . 
  ` conventional ' pornography is not illegal to view in any way , online or otherwise . 
  it is , however , illegal to * produce * ( but not to view ) pornography which contains certain acts ( urination , female ejaculation or violence just to name a few ) . 
  also , i would imagine the police would not be very happy with you presenting/viewing pornography in public - that would be a breach of ` public decency ' . 
  however , when i said :  ` indecent ' or ` obscene ' materials i perhaps should have clarified that was meant only to mean illegal classifications of porn ( which i imagine is a definition which is fairly universal amongst western nations ) , this is basically a catchall term which will include stuff which is genuinely disgusting and/or immoral like child porn or bestiality e.t.c. 
  kind of a bit more forgiving on that whole thing in the uk , wild camping is largely allowed here , as long as it is n't on private land , a farm or in a conservation area . 
  national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty are usually accepting of it , as long as you 're respectful of your surroundings . 
  i would imagine that this attitude has something to do with the spirit of the [ mass trespass in 1932 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_trespass_of_kinder_scout ) which effectively resulted in the [ * ` countryside and rights of way act 2000 ' * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/countryside_and_rights_of_way_act_2000 ) which gave a comprehensive right to roam in the uk , this is exaggerated in scotland with a full ` right to roam ' , whereas , in england and wales , it applies only to uncultivated land . 
  weapons of any sort , without proper registration or justification . 
  it 's illegal in ** all ** cases to be carrying a firearm in public , but legal to own them ( apart from assault or concealable weapons ) as long as you have a licence , which are surprisingly simple to obtain , as long as you do n't mind paying a fair few quid and waiting a while . 
  ` melee ' weapons are completely legal to own in your own home - no need for a licence . 
  however , carrying them in public is another issue . 
  small and functional ones like pen knives , swiss army knives , or tools of any kind are legal to carry , as long as you can justify being in possession . 
  for instance , if you went camping or hiking e.t.c. 
  the police would have no issue with you carrying a functional blade . 
  however , if you were just popping down the shops in a town/city centre with a pen knife or a hammer , they would probably want to know why you have it , and you 'd best have a good reason . 
  additionally , there is : * a motorised vehicle which is simultaneously in use * and * without ; a recent mot , proof of taxation or insurance . 
  * ` hateful ' or seditious materials . 
  * self-defence sprays of any kind . 
  * uncut or rough diamonds ( going to say it 's safe to assume you are n't a smuggler of blood diamonds and other illegal precious minerals , are you ? ), 
  * ` indecent ' or ` obscene ' materials ( fairly sure you know what * that * means ) . 
  * plants or animals which are endangered . 
  * meat or dairy products personally imported from non-eu countries . 
  also , there are the obvious things like illegal narcotics e.t.c. 
  y' know , the kind of stuff which is illegal in pretty much most , if not all countries . 
  in summation , in the uk , ( to the best of my knowledge ) there is n't really * too * many things which are restricted when compared to other nations ( apart from with our approach to weaponry ) . 
  p.s this is all i could think of with my limited legal knowledge , so bear in mind that there may well be *** a lot *** more , which i am simply ignorant of at the time of writing . 
  ... yes . 
  haha, 
  all games ( including eu iv , vic 2 , hoi , civ e.t.c. 
  ) : england/united kingdom . 
  the enemy is always going to be france - i 'm english , i need an outlet for my irrational and ancestral hatred of the french , what else were you expecting ? 
  in the uk i 've only ever heard people say it was bad luck . 
  huh , thats odd , in the uk a ` cure ' for bad luck is to throw a pinch of salt over your shoulder .
