  agreed , it shows just how divided and un unified europe still is after 20 years of prosperity and movement towards unity . 
   germany under merkel 's leadership has failed at every step of the way in it 's eu leadership . 
  germany has been more concerned about people and countries that are n't in the eu than those in the eu . 
  i disagree , germany has done all it can , it is just not the right country to lead europe , it is too resented in a continent with long memories . 
  that responsibility imo should be with france or perhaps britain , poland i think is also a candidate in the future . 
   she has failed at every single turn . 
  when the history books will be written about this period in 25 years , i have no doubt nobody will receive as much blame than her , for her unwillingness to put aside local politics at the expense of the eu and simply for her incompetence as the leader of the biggest and most powerful eu country . 
  mmmm , i do n't quite see it that way , i agree with many of the points you make but i think merkel was constrained by her reality , the idea of german leadership is not popular among europeans . 
  merkel has to both lead and appear not to be leading . 
  a great discussion point . 
  the usa is a lone superpower and the world hegemon something which it will fight to retain . 
  all nations when dealing with the usa must consider this reality , europe as a whole is no exception . 
  imo this expansion into the baltic is broadly inline with european interests as it guards against weaker states falling under russian influence . 
  this is not something europe could accomplish easily on its own due to how slowly and un unified its actions are . 
  so in this respect the usa is providing a quick fix to the problem . 
  however the usa 's actions in europe help fuel the ongoing russia vs ` american europe ' story , which often has more truth to it than we like to believe . 
  if europe were to act on its own ; unlikely but not impossible then i think we might have a shot at better long term relations with russian . 
  europe is however weak , it will not unify in the foreseeable future , which means for such a change in situation to occur you would need a willing european power , a role which can only be filled by france or the uk as germany has too much history and is already resented by much of europe . 
  i know , seriously who is on the eu 's pr team . 
   how can somebody making # 30,000 a year afford a # 600,000 house ? 
  they do n't . 
  they buy one for # 180,000 instead . 
  30k is about 23k a year after tax so 1.9 k a month . 
  you can easily find a place to live with bills and such for # 400 a month and then you save # 400 having # 250 a week to spend how you please . 
  after 4 years you will have your deposit and can get a mortgage which will be around 1,000 a month , perhaps less . 
  [ example house ] ( http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-53935283.html ), 
   on the other hand a decrease in population is not that big of a deal see japan . 
  suck it france, 
  agreed , however we might well be in a catch 22 with this , why bother getting involved the usa will sort it . 
  perhaps without the usa 's presence europe would be more compelled to take action . 
  i agree . 
  in the cold war both the usa and europe had a shared interest . 
  europe could not defend against the soviet union without the usa help and the usa could not compete in the long run against a potential soviet friendly europe . 
  today however there is no shared interest , europe can not be overrun by russian , it is simply to weak in comparison to mainland europe . 
  there is now only the usa 's interest of ensuring no pan european power forms . 
  do n't get me wrong if i was an eastern european nation i would jump at the chance to enter nato , however i do n't think we , europeans should have allowed it . 
  europe was occupied territory from 1945 to 1990 however that occupation has n't ended imo , the usa never left . 
  the last 25 years gave europe a window to reinstate its sovereignty and take control of its own destiny , however it has n't , it has instead arguably let us occupation continue to expand . 
  like i said before , the usa is a world hegemon , it will do everything in its power to maintain that position . 
  why is it so stupid ? 
  [ it is as clear as day ] ( http://www.phibetaiota.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nato-expansion-by-other-means.jpg ) . 
  nato actually made arguably vague commits towards that end , stating that it would not militarize east of germany . 
  to not consider the alternative viewpoint is very naive . 
  russia is not an irrational power , it acts in its own self interest as do all nations , the question is what are those interests . 
  i am simply providing you with an alternative narrative to that put forward by nato . 
   fuck the russians . 
  right . 
  and you are this is the most upvoted comment here ... . . well done r/europe , well done . 
  suck it france, 
  i think it was japan , but i will check . 
  japan in the late 80s early 90s was viewed as a third rising superpower . 
  yep it was japan . 
  ** usa $ 5,979.592 ( 1990 ) ** ** japan $ 3,103.698 ( 1990 ) ** ** soviet union $ 2,500 billion ( 1989 ) ** ** side note . 
  ** when japan 's economy peaked in 1995 it was 70 % the size of the us economy . 
  today china is only at 60 % . 
  so that the usa can have more influence inside the eu, 
  [ salami-slice strategy ] ( https://youtu.be/ix_d_vmkswe?t=1m35s ) . 
  russia will try to confuse and make their actions very unclear like they have in ukraine . 
  we do n't know if they are , these are just theories and ideas put out there by academics . 
  true but the diagram has a set destination which the narrative is designed to move towards . 
  if we discard the narrative and end point the flowchart would be endless and that assumes we can know all the possible outcomes , which we ca n't . 
  we must consider this a thought experiment and approach the model knowing its limitations . 
  not a direct occupation but rather an indirect one sponsored by the usa and other with the aim of breaking up russia , but i do n't doubt it would be part of the plan going in to such a situation . 
  which is exactly what the chart says . 
  i fear you are missing the point here . 
  to which i have provided you with evidence to the contrary , both scenarios and results are more than plausible , with the first being actively planned for . 
  you may want to disagree but the evidence disagrees with you . 
  the chart is saying just that !, 
  it does n't go straight from riots to nuclear war , it shows the progressive stages and potential points of resolution . 
  why ? 
  no just people who study global politics , many of whom believe that germany will not act and go to war for a baltic neighbour , europe loses a lot of credibility when its largest economy looks the other way . 
  this is why the usa will be a continued often resented presence in western europe for sometime to come . 
  a few talks here , i could list more but googling the topic will yield plenty of results [ poland between russia and germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q7agyqoans ) [ the ukraine crisis : withstand and deter russian aggression ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kvgp4lldes ), 
   the idea that nato would occupy moscow is demented . 
  and yet it has been discussed more than once by a few geo-political commentators , many of whom suggest that europe ca n't be peaceful until russia is divided and neutered . 
   germany is peace-loving and our economy would like to see the sanctions against russia removed , however this does not apply to the case of a war with russia . 
  many political commentators feel differently about the german russian relationship , they see it as a fundamental flaw in today 's europe . 
   moscow warns of genocide . 
  protestor clashes lead to some violence . '', 
  -  `` nato urges calm '' then invariably leads to `` far-right volunteers or ` little green men ' appear . '', 
  why ? 
  that was pretty much what occurred in crimea and what is being planned for in other baltic states . 
  [ vice news on little green men seize lithuanian town exercise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cphoeeppzo8 )  `` moscow occupied '' invariably leads to russia setting off a last-ditch all-out nuclear strike against the west . 
  well yes , see [ here , the dead hand system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dead_hand_ ( nuclear_war ) )  in 2011 , the commander of the russian strategic missile forces , sergey karakaev , in an interview with komsomolskaya pravda , confirmed the operational state of the perimeter assessment and communication system . 
  only if you assume that we make it all the way down the tree , which i do n't think anybody does . 
  this is a thought experiment , it has to be fantasy to some degree . 
  europe has no shared destiny , this whole scenario has shown that . 
  can we please remember that gdp per capita in any form is still a very woolly measure of citizens wealth . 
  it really is , bugger . 
  it would be a interesting thought experiment though . 
  the number one priority would be to destroy all us forces in europe and then ensure maritime access to the european mainland . 
  no idea if that 's achievable . 
  can confirm , no new york only a york, 
  tax revenue that high assumes high level of public spending , public spending which will become more difficult to fund as tax payers shrink and dependents grow . 
  some of those tax burdens are going to become unsustainable as europe ages . 
  they do , and the paper . 
  it would depend of greece 's reserves . 
  still as i have pointed out above i do n't think the physical money is important . 
  qe is done without it . 
  it is , however what would stop them from just creating and transferring fake digits ?
