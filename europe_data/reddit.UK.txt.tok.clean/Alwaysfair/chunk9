  [ see here ] ( http://www.reinisfischer.com/average-salary-european-union-2014 ) , however years are not comparable . 
  they are median values , the median is a measure of average . 
   i decided to compare how does average salary have changed a year latter . 
  and i found following ; average median salary has decreased for about -1.3 % in european union in 2015 , resulting in eur 1470 / usd 1631 down from eur 1489 / usd 1861 in 2014 . 
  i 'm confident it was closer than that , i did the maths before in a post . 
  i 'll see if i can find it . 
  edit : found it , [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2u8msr/til_in_1995_japan_gdp_was_69_of_the_usas_today/ ) . 
  japan peaked at 69 % and in 2014 china was only at 55 % of the us economy . 
  granted , but that 's a big swing we are looking at , the eurozone 's outlook must be like looking into the abyss, 
  [ yep , there is even a name for it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/il_sorpasso_ ( economics ) ), 
  yep , if you look back at past figures it was overtaken by [ japan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_largest_historical_gdp ) , but in fairenss japan almost surpassed the usa at one point . 
  [ these imf ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2015&amp;ey=2020&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=82&amp;pr1.y=13&amp;c=132%2c112%2c134&amp;s=ngdpd&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) projections seem a little off to me , as they predict that the german economy will only be about 5 % larger than the uk 's by 2020 . 
  i mean that 's great and all but i did n't think we were due to change places until the 2030s . 
   eventually economic growth is a slow game and some economist argue it will become more difficult as the current cheap labour export models of growth fade in the next few decades . 
  i do however mostly agree . 
  demographics are on the uk side at least gving it a fighting chance , with some estimates suggestions the uk 's population will hit [ 100 million or above by the end of the century ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_338113.pdf ), 
  germany 's economy is only about 25 % larger than the uk 's and the uk is projected to close that gap further over the coming years and surpass germany in the 2030s . 
  i 'm not saying cultural connections are an ace in the hole , but rather that they provide another means and strengthen the uk 's global soft power , for which the uk currently [ ranks 1st ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soft_power ) . 
  germany does not have this ability to the same degree outside of the eu , the eu which the uk is also a member . 
  military strength or rather its presence has far more utility than you might think , it does n't need to be direct military action , take poland 's recent request for troops or the persian gulf , more specifaclly the [ strait of hormuz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strait_of_hormuz ) . 
  last year the uk may have `` bent the knee '' to china for economic favours however china 's economy is fed only because the uk allows it , 40 % of china 's oil needs pass through that strait . 
  a strait that is surrounded by at least 3 uk military bases , uk arab allies and an under construction carrier capable naval base . 
  the uk maybe a former superpower but such a large global presences dies hard . 
  also the uk is a un security council member and nuclear power . 
  hard power and commonwealth connections . 
  germany dominates europe , but has a much smaller global footprint . 
  they have a lot of people to get through , 4x the population of the usa in fact . 
  the uk should simply aim to be first among the second tier of nations , which arguably it already is as china is transitioning into the superpower tier . 
  lowers head in shame . 
  untill 2018 ... . 
  and as always suck it france, 
  i 've thought about this and length and had a few discussions on other subs about it . 
  the general opinion mine included is that russia lacks power projection , power projection that both france and the uk have and japan is developing . 
  imo true military power should be based off this because what threat does russia pose if it ca n't get to you ? 
  this is why imo the usa is top , then france followed closely by the uk . 
  russia has never been a superpower , the ussr was one but not russia on it 's own . 
  if we are to consider it a superpower today which we wo n't because it 's wrong we would also need to add china , japan , france and the uk to the definition . 
  by definition there can only be one hyperpower , so i think the term is best avoided as it add confusion to an already misused set of terms . 
  most writers reference the usa as a superpower and global hegemon , the usa is now starting to lose the hegemon status but it will always be a superpower . 
  in europe ? 
  france, 
  you 'll be ok , first among equals in the superpower game i think , not including russia as its not a superpower, 
  yep the usa 's golden quarter century is over and arguably they wasted it by failing to form a new global system . 
  we live in an america dominated world that 's why, 
   the capital generates 22 % of uk gdp despite accounting for only 12.5 % of the uk population . 
  except london is widely regarded as having europe 's largest commuter belt , even omitting that and going for london 's met population we get 15million ( source eurostat i think ) about 23 % of the uk total , not 12 % . 
  poor research bbc . 
  yeah sounds about right , i think the uk might edge it globally picking up places like the uae . 
  the real question is second preference . 
  er ... japan ? 
  beat me to it . 
  the usa should win this , if not their past 70 years of foreign policy has failed . 
  the usa again is clearly the uk top ally , however this is perhaps slightly more mutual than other international relationships . 
  going forward i would like to see the uk and france become closer however , yes france . 
  leaving the eurozone might be, 
  it provides a backstop to the issue . 
  clearly a trade war wo n't occur , wto tariff are the worst outcome for both parties . 
  using u/cpt _ ballsack above scenario it 's a `` complete breakdown of trade '' . 
  it 's important for context , many of the discussions and news articles seem to assume all nations are dependent on trade to the same degree . 
  i was referring to trade as a percentage of gdp . 
  yes i agree the usa extracts great benefit from the dollar , however it could be decades before the dollar is seriously replaced . 
  some of germany 's economy , but not all of it . 
  germany is growing way beyond it 's means . 
  i agree though , both the uk and france could do with a better trade balance . 
  russia is n't a superpower these days , not for the past 25 years , it is interesting though . 
  perhaps the most interesting nation is in fact the usa , where total trade accounts for such 16 % of it 's gdp and a notable amount of that is done with mexico and canada . 
  the usa really is n't that important from a trade perspective . 
   the growth has mainly been in services with new low-wage jobs . 
  what wrong with that , there 's nothing nobel about manufacturing . 
  i do agree however that low wage jobs are indeed a problem , but some research seems to point to the fact that it 's a trade off between low wage or higher unemployment . 
   when foreign investors loose trust in the uk economy because of the falling pound and bleak future outlooks for the economy , they stop sending the money the uk needs to compensate its triple deficit : trade deficit , current account deficit and budget deficit ( sovereign debts ) . 
  that would release a chain reaction to tank the economy . 
  yes this is a real worry . 
   if you are lucky it happens before march to allow the government a brexit u-turn , if it happens gradually there is nothing to stop the downward path . 
  if it 's gradual the economy will rebalance , it 's sudden shocks which will worry markets . 
  actually i would argue the opposite , germany is one of the most exposed . 
  germany is far more dependent on exports than france and in a stagnant eurozone germany needs to find customer with growing demand , customers like the usa , china and the uk . 
  there was a recent report on this , see [ here ] ( https://geopoliticalfutures.com/major-german-exporter-struggles/ ), 
   looser apologies, 
  i was n't using gross values , i was using percentages , rather crudely i might add , but i think i made my point clear . 
  you 're right though , there is a lot more to this . 
  you deleted your original post . 
  still , why have you not included other european nations ? 
  the uk had the one of the largest drops in gdp and has yet grown and managed to recover faster than other european nations who experience far less of a decline . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.google.ie/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:gbr:usa:aus&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:gbr:deu:fra:ita:bel&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=1160262000000&amp;tend=1412722800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  who knows , it 's not going to be pretty . 
  i would be surprised however if brexit undermined the city 's fundamental strengths . 
  oh i agree , no winners here and the uk would be the biggest loser . 
  as for only just recovering , i would take issue with that . 
  the uk has been one of the few bright spots for economic growth in europe and the developed world . 
  this is something often omitted by many making this argument . 
  [ link ] ( https://data.oecd.org/trade/trade-in-goods-and-services.htm ) . 
  the uk is the least dependent on exports in the eu ( by this chart ) at 27 % of it 's gdp , germany by comparison is at 47 % , denmark 53 % , france however fairs the same as the uk at about 30 % . 
  so if and let 's be honest this is a hypothetical , a trade war was to occur , the uk would stand to loose around 13 % of it 's gdp , germany 3 % , netherlands around 5 % . 
  while the uk is clearly the biggest loser it does n't fair as bad as other eu nation 's would in the same position . 
  edit : thank you u/low _ discrepancy, 
  hard right ? 
  you mean right of the european centre , would be called a socialist in places like korea , japan and the usa . 
  just say right leaning . 
  as for the rest , yes the uk is benefits greatly from foreign investment , but it would be more than a stretch to say it priorities accommodation over all else .
