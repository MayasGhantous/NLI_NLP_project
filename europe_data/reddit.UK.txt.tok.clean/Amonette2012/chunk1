well yeah that 's pretty much what i 've observed ( about under 25s ) , but if you talk to older age groups you see a different picture . 
  it 's a little naive though , it 's like implying that the main parties are n't just as racist . 
  for example ( and i apologise in advance for linking to the mirror but i did n't want to spend all night googling for the same list from a more reputable paper ) : ** tory racism : ** http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/proof-camerons-tories-racist-sexist-191792 http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2013/04/22/openly-racist-tory-councillor-quits-over-boarding-school-com http://www.kentonline.co.uk/deal/news/bob-frost-accused-of-racism-15560/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-22243953 http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/01/conservative-councillor-chris-joannides-facebook ** labour racism : ** http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100127409/was-diane-abbotts-tweet-racist/ http://cifwatch.com/2014/09/24/guardian-silent-about-labour-candidates-suspension-for-racist-tweets/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10689115/anti-racism-mp-under-fire-after-posing-with-son-blacked-up-to-look-like-michael-jackson.html http://www.conservativehome.com/localgovernment/2011/02/labour-councillor-suspended-over-racist-email.html http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29049078 http://www.obv.org.uk/news-blogs/racism-festers-lambeth-labour http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/labour-party-accused-racial-discrimination ** lib dem racism : ** http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/yoursay/letters/11083815.racist_assault_councillor_must_resign/ http://politicalscrapbook.net/2012/01/lib-dem-anti-islam-candidate/ http://swns.com/news/lib-dem-councillor-accused-racism-slamming-labours-scottish-candidate-34812/ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/lib-dems-in-fresh-row-over-racist-leaflet-1503514.html http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/02/lib-dems-are-still-not-addressing-their-race-problem now please , convince me that ukip are the only racists in government . 
  i have no issue with people choosing to vote for whoever they want to for any reason that is important to them , but i do get a little tired of the ` they 're racist scum ' rhetoric when it 's pretty bloody clear that you could say the same thing about any mainstream political party . 
  yeah milliband is unelectable , he looks like he was created by nick park . 
  oh yeah , that 's true as well . 
  there are a number of reasons for their recent rise but i feel that the eu was one of the things that got the ball rolling . 
  if farrage actually gave someone a bloody nose it would only make him more popular ( assuming the recipient was someone like cameron ) . 
  europe is one of the prevailing reasons though , it 's just not the only one . 
  i did n't give a full blow by blow because we 're talking more about uk attitudes to the eu here . 
  exactly . 
  ukip would n't be gaining any traction if there was n't wide dissatisfaction with the uk 's relationship with europe on a number of levels . 
  i 've met people from all sorts of backgrounds who are either voting for them or at least glad they 're there even thought they do n't vote for them to push the anti-europe agenda and scare the major parties into changing their policies . 
  some of them even find farrage a refreshing change from cameromilliclegg 's general sliminess , which may be naive , as a politician is a politician , but it does go to show how sick people are of what we have already . 
  most of the people i know who are anti-ukip are under 25 and tend to be swayed by sensational stories , or are from another country and living in the uk . 
  true but i was talking more about british born citizens . 
  good point . 
  i guess so . 
  i just ca n't relate to the mentality of ` all that 's available is something that will literally rot my flesh away until it kills me so i guess i 'll try that ' , but then i am not a hopeless case drug addict , so i suppose i would n't . 
  too hard to tell from the picture . 
  yeah it could be a junkie with a secondary infection , possibly shot veins from injecting into his legs that got infected , after all junkies do n't have the best immune systems . 
  me too , especially given the sore on his leg . 
  i still do n't understand why people take that shit . 
  north korea 's space agency is a bunch of stomp rockets . 
  i read the title and thought it was the daily mail . 
  please can we just abduct cameron now , and put him somewhere safe where he can play with his toys until the next election ? 
  you have a very valid point and it 's actually caused me to look at my opinion and see a couple of holes in it . 
  we ca n't consider immigration differences between countries purely on the merits of ` fairness ' . 
  you mention somalia as an example , and yes , you 're right there . 
  we have two main groups of immigrants - skilled people who come here to work in fields where we need them , that 's to be encouraged . 
  we also have people fleeing countries in which their quality of life is very low or where they have very little , or nothing at all . 
  while i am proud of the fact that the uk is a place that supports refugees and shelters those who might be dead if they were n't here , the sheer number of migrants who do n't in fact benefit our country to coming here causes a weariness in our approach to immigration , hence my first post . 
  in response to the lowlands comment - ok , i get what you 're saying , but just because your country is more overpopulated than my country it does n't mean my point does n't stand . 
  plus you 're taking that as an average over the whole country - the uk has a huge north / south divide , with parts of scotland being much less overpopulated compared to huge urban sprawls in the south . 
  while the immigration policy seems that way , it 's not as though it was put together overnight . 
  it seems logical that there would be differences in the way that it is implemented , otherwise you would have to change the entire system every time there was a change . 
  i 'm not trying to claim that out immigration system is anything other than horrendously broken , but i do think that what can appear to be a prejudice against a particular nation can usually be attributed to the entire system being broken , and to the fatigue many people feel towards the increasing ease with which people seem to be able to migrate here . 
   if you ' r gon na make immigration more strict why not for people from outside of the eu and why make it restrictive for specific eu countries ? 
  ( like bulgaria , romania and such ) so on the one hand you think we should make it easier for people from some countries to emigrate here , but on the other you think we should make it harder for others . 
  why should we make it easier for , say , bulgarians and harder for , say , japanese ? 
  should there be a difference ? 
  personally i think the system needs tightening in all directions . 
  why do you think people from one country might work harder than another ? 
  also take a long term view on this . 
  not everyone supports the ` invite everyone ! ', 
  immigration policy we 've had over the last god knows how many years . 
  i 'm speculating here , but think of this as a leaky boat . 
  a new leak appears , people try to plug it . 
  as it becomes possible for people from more and more countries to legally come here in some way , i 'm guessing slowing tactics evolve to deal with each new incoming tide . 
  did n't get your point about the lowlands . 
  well , maybe this is because the uk is actually a pretty small place , and it already has a huge number of people in it . 
  i know a lot of people want to come and work here , but personally i 'm a bit sick of seeing my home village slowly become a town and merge with other villages , obliterating woodland , fields and allotments just to build another housing estate because we 're so overpopulated . 
  it 's irritating to walk past the council and see hoards of healthy young men from other countries blithely claiming benefits . 
  it 's a little weird to return to the town i went to school in and realise that my old school , which used to be on the edge of town , is now somewhere in the middle without having moved . 
  so maybe we need a little bureaucracy to keep the numbers down . 
  maybe we 're just a little bit sick of having to repeat our order three times in a loud clear voice because the person behind the counter ca n't actually speak the functional english required to do their job , a job for which they have accepted a wage pitched so low that anyone who lives here permanently would n't be able to accept it . 
  perhaps we 're just a little tired of living in a country that 's so fucking desirable to half of europe that we have to build all over it to house them and translate every official document into twenty seven fricking languages . 
  now i appreciate that this kind of bureaucracy is inconveniencing the kind of skilled , hard working immigrants we 'd actually like to attract , because immigration and emigration are natural in any country , but before you start calling us uptight xenophobic bastards , maybe you should consider that there are reasons we do n't want every one who wants a better life to move here . 
  one of them being the fact that we have a population much larger than that of canada crammed into an island that you could fit into france twice . 
  come back in 50 years time when we 've just given up and concreted the whole place . 
  the museum has a whale skeleton hanging from the roof it 's a good place to buy amber and absinthe the public transport system has to be one of the most sensible and functional in eurpope all the palace guards are hot watch out for food poisoning . 
  from the number of people i 've known who got sick there ( myself included , worst incidence of food poisoning i 've ever had ) it really pays off to eat carefully . 
  i would avoid street food entirely , also i know three people who think they got their bug from reheated lasagne , whereas the home cooked czech cuisine doesnt ' seem to poison anyone ( and is lovely , i do n't know why the hell you 'd order italian food when there 's czech food on offer ) . 
  claims to have the biggest music club in middle europe , or did when i went a few years back , but i 'm not sure if there is a larger one somewhere else now ... 
  i 've been there , lovely town !, 
  given that you know nothing about the demographics of the actual area i live in this is n't very meaningful . 
  it 's mainly just simple observation from living in an area that has a very high level of immigration for quite a long time . 
  i 'm sure if you wanted to go research it you 'd find something interesting , but i 'm just offering an opinion based on my own observations , if you want sources go do some research , 
  wait ... what does birth rate have to do with it ? 
  why do you want to encourage more breeding ? 
  do you mean among immigrants or nationals ? 
  i 'm second generation british , my family emigrated here from poland in the 60s . 
  the view of muslim immigrants from our perspective is that when our family came to this country they learned the language , worked very hard , changed religion from catholic to protestant ( at least in my mother 's case ) and for all intents and purposes became british and embraced the british culture . 
  in contrast , we see a lot of muslim immigrants and people of muslim descent who have done the exact opposite . 
  some members of the family will never learn english , there is minimal integration and many muslem communities actively try to change the area around them . 
  then there 's the welfare side - compare muslim immigrants to eastern european immigrants - there are a lot fewer of the latter claiming state benefit . 
  my former countrymen come to work , pay taxes and do jobs that people here do n't really want to do , then mostly they return home again . 
  we see them coming , bring the entire family , half of whom have no intention of working , and claiming every last penny they can . 
  this causes resentment . 
  who do you think funded the extraction and infrastructure ? 
  what happens to the oil has n't been confirmed yet for one simple reason - scotland are n't going to actually achieve independence so there 's no point wasting time talking about it . 
  if they did , scotland would lose at least half of it , if not more . 
  i 'd love to see scotland leave the uk - we 'd be richer without them . 
  the oil revenue does n't even cover the amount we spend on them . 
  now you 're just being silly . 
  there 's no point trying to participate in a serious discussion if you 're just going to come out with pointless trolling . 
  exactly . 
  even if they did manage to become independent and retain a larger share of the oil ( which is gon na run out in the next 20-40 years anyway ) they will still have a deficit because scotland generates less money in oil than is spent on it . 
  scottish people will be poorer after independence . 
  there is a reason the british government does n't have a contingency plan - they do n't need one because scotland is never going to be stupid enough to vote for it . 
  this is all just a cock waving exercise by salmond and co. 
  i honestly do not know , but then a hell of a lot of what our government does is crazy to me . 
  it 's probably because they know that if scotland by some fluke did manage to become independent they 'd fall on their asses within a decade and we 'd have to send them aid . 
  yeah i do n't really think you know very much about this so i 'm not gon na bother arguing with you . 
  the oil belongs to the uk . 
  scotland leaves , they lose it . 
  it 's mostly mined with our technology and money . 
  plus saying that scotland pays for itself ? 
  that just ai n't true cupcake - see link below : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16477990  scotland accounts for 8.4 % of the uk population , 8.3 % of the uk 's total output and 8.3 % of the uk 's non-oil tax revenues - but 9.2 % of total uk public spending . 
   what about revenues ?
