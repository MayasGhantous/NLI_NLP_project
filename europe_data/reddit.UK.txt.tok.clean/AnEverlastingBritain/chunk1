it was part of the ottoman empire for over 400 years , and all sorts of ` changes ' have occurred during that time . 
  europe is more than a geographical area , and romania does not share the high european culture and society found in europe . 
  i 'm allowed an opinion . 
  the guardian is almost entirely opinion these days . 
  these opinion articles are always at the top of the front page , promoting them as headline topics . 
  the guardian rarely does factual news anymore . 
  i could insult your country and its legacy and people as well if you was n't too ashamed to reveal it in in your flair . 
  no , people like you have nothing to be proud or happy about with your own countries so you just focus your nationalism on the eu instead . 
  it 's pathetic how so many try to steal the achievements of the nation states of europe for the eu . 
  the british empire civilised the world .

  yeah , the best ones . 
  the uk is n't maintained through military occupation like the roman britain or the danelaw , your comparison is ridiculous i 'm afraid .

  most people probably are n't even aware that austria is its own country , let alone be able to point to it on a map . 
  i think all austria is , is a pub trivia quiz answer on where hitler really came from . 
  the difference is that there are real etho-cultural bonds between the people of the uk , which is why our union has endured hundreds of years . 
  most countries in the eu ca n't even be ` trusted ' to hold a vote on eu membership because their governments know they 'll vote to leave the bloc too . 
  and the oecd forecasts the eurozone to comprise just 9 % of global gdp in 2060 . 
  for comparisons , japan forms 7 % today . 
  the future of the eu will be that of just a slightly more important japan . 
  hardly the superpower you and other eu zealots dream of . 
  i do n't think living under a foreign flag , sacrificing your sovereignty and the ability to affect your own decision-making process is worth that underwhelming future . 
  if the uk is the usa 's 51st state then every country in europe and around the world that is even more heavily dependent on the usa than the uk is the 52nd , 53rd , 54th state and so on . 
  if britain of all countries is america 's 51st state then what does that make * austria * ? 
   and france is literally one of the creators the european union . 
  for centuries , since charlemagne and napol\u00e9on , we 've dreamt of creating a `` european empire '' on the continent . 
  yes , this is how most french people trick themselves into being okay with the eu project . 
  your comment is evidence that while mainland europeans accuse britain of having grand dreams of glory and power on the world stage , that it is really mainland europeans who use the eu as a proxy to re-live days of past glory . 
  eu membership only provides an illusion of global power , even a federal europe will be inconsequential on the world stage in 50 years . 
  i pity you mainlanders who will give up so much culture and identity to pursue this path . 
  you 'll never know such a blessing . 
  i tend to ignore what you say on such matters . 
  you show only the eu flag so are clearly awfully ashamed of wherever you come from .

   i support northern ireland if you support northern ireland then you support northern ireland remaining in the uk , as [ only around 20 % of the people in northern ireland even want a united ireland ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37309706 ) . 
  northern ireland is n't held in the uk against its will . 
   the industrial revolution was the result of colonization and slavery the legitimate purchase of cotton is n't a crime . 
  as for slavery in general , slavery never formed a large percentage of the british economy in the early 18th century and did not build up the wealth that financed the industrial revolution . 
  no other slave-trading nation made such strides towards industrialisation . 
  frankly it would n't matter if such industrialisation * was * the result of slavery or colonialisation ( which it was n't ) seeings as such practices were carried out by every country in existence until britain began to suppress the trade . 
  it is for those such qualities that britain stands out as a nation . 
   i do know that ireland was , at one time , just as wealthy if not wealthier than england . 
  a devolved country , undoubtedly , but far from `` poor '' or `` barbaric . '', 
  sophisticated education and legal systems and a growing economy . 
  for instance , ireland 's wealth grew dramatically in the 14th and 15th centuries which is what scared the english crown into beginning its centuries long and , ultimately , failed invasion . 
  uhuh , you better have some sources for those frankly ridiculous claims . 
  ireland never reached the wealth of any major european country in those centuries and was a collection of disunited tribes . 
  it was only united and civilised by english and subsequent british kings over long centuries . 
  dublin became the second city of the empire * because * it was in the empire and received the benefits of it just like the rest of the uk did . 
   19thc ireland had 8 million people , at the time about half of england 's population : then london let them starve while exporting food . 
  the irish population had only increased to that much in the previous century , largely because of the better living standards brought about by british rule and british advancements . 
  the famine might have subsequently occurred during british rule because of poor british management but ireland had only been able to develop to the level it was at because of british rule in the first place . 
  the main examples of pre-british civilisation in ireland are charming but comparatively primitive towers . 
  [ this is a typical instance of irish 14th century architecture . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_round_tower#/media/file:glendalough_round_tower.jpg ) while these are examples of english architecture from the same era .

  the irish were barbarians to the english back then . 
  the third link , to a model of lincoln cathedral built in 1311 with its spire intact , was the first building to surpass the height of the great pyramid of giza after 3800 years . 
  irish people were still living in huts back then .

  not sure how the new us ones under construction compare , but they 're probably not big enough to be considered a whole new classification . 
  it was difficult teaching you savages to stop living in mud huts but we got there in the end :-), 
  england treaty scotland like a normal country and not ` helping ' the colony is n't a crime if that 's what you 're referring to . 
  no , you clearly with no understanding of british history . 
  is n't it funny how much you can deduce from a person with a quick glance at their comment history . 
  you sir are an american liberal . 
  you have grown to hate your country in recent years - perhaps the election of donald trump has tipped you over the edge . 
  you 've begun to reject your white american identity and instead cling to a fair real or imagined irish heritage , which is why you go online calling for the unification of ireland despite not being from northern or southern ireland yourself . 
  never mind , let me educate you . 
  going back to roman times southern england has always been more developed and advanced than the rest of the british isles , ( ireland for example was a backwards land devoid of civilisation only inhabited by disunited tribes well into the 1400s ) . 
  english advancement occurred for assorted reasons , from better climate to trade connections provided by various conquers to more fertile land in the south . 
  after a time , the south of great britain eventually unified into kingdom of england which grew wealthy and formed the predecessor to the british empire , the less well known * english empire * . 
  during this time , wales had been conquered and civilisation was slowly brought to ireland via conquest . 
  scotland remained independent .
