  scotland attempted to form its own empire with colonisation efforts in central america funded at great expense to the scottish people . 
  ultimately this colony failed , bankrupting the nation . 
  scotland and england had already shared a royal family for nearly 100 years by this point . 
  scotland joined with england , creating the united kingdom , to gain the economic benefits of the now british empire 's markets , and england joined with scotland to prevent the country allying with england 's eternal enemy france which would have provided a place for french soldiers to invade from . 
  soon after the acts of union , one of the single greatest phenomena of all time occurred in england . 
  [ the industrial revolution transformed the united kingdom into the world 's first industrial nation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9bdvhcunps ) , giving the nation ahead start in global colonisation and economic power never before seen in the world . 
  this development was focused in england because it began in england among english people . 
  scottish economists greatly contributed however , and wealth also went north . 
  the great cities of scotland today standing in such beauty are a testament to this wealth . 
  every part of the uk benefited from the industrial revolution and overseas expansion of empire . 
  for a time , dublin was the ` second city ' of the british empire . 
  south east england saw the most wealth because it 's where most people lived . 
  england today forms 84 % of the uk population . 
  there has been a lack of funding and investment for the rest of the uk in modern decades , but that 's something the uk gov has been working on . 
  there are efforts to create a ` northern powerhouse ' in northern england to rival london as a commercial centre . 
  obviously , such schemes will take decades to be achieved . 
  in short - scotland , wales and ireland would be like poorer versions of iceland if they had n't been part of the uk . 
  they never would have industrialised or developed economically until the 20th century . 
  there are correct definitions , but they are all used incorrectly at various times because of the colloquial nature of modern english . 
  the uk is a nation state comprised of 4 countries . 
  scotland is a country but not a nation state . 
  if scotland became independent it would be a country and a nation state . 
  the uk itself is still a unitary state so some refer to it as a ` country ' as well as a nation state . 
  no it is n't , it 's just wanting to be like a normal country with control over its own foreign policy . 
  the uk * is * bound by its membership of the european union however via the european union 's common foreign and security policy and other parts of the updated treaty on european union ( the lisbon treaty ) . 
  article 21 ( relevant parts )  ** the union shall define and pursue common policies and actions ** , and shall work for a high degree of cooperation in all fields of international relations , in order to :  1 . 
   ( a ) ** safeguard its values , fundamental interests , security , independence and integrity ; ** ------  3 . 
  ** the union shall respect the principles and pursue the objectives set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 ** in the development and implementation of the different areas of the union 's external action covered by this title and by part five of the treaty on the functioning of the european union , and of the external aspects of its other policies . 
   ** the union shall ensure consistency between the different areas of its external action and between these and its other policies . 
  the council and the commission , assisted by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , shall ensure that consistency and shall cooperate to that effect . 
  ** -- article 23  1 . 
  ** the union 's action on the international scene shall be guided by the principles which have inspired its own creation , development and enlargement ** , and which it seeks to advance in the wider world : democracy , the rule of law , the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms , respect for human dignity , the principles of equality and solidarity , and respect for the principles of the united nations charter and international law . 
  ----- article 24  ** the common foreign and security policy is subject to specific rules and procedures . 
  it shall be defined and implemented by the european council and the council acting unanimously , except where the treaties provide otherwise . 
  the adoption of legislative acts shall be excluded ** . 
  the common foreign and security policy shall be put into effect by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy and by member states , in accordance with the treaties . 
  -- it goes on and on with various stimulation and objectives which clearly show the limitations placed on member states , but we come to the biggest issue now . 
  ------ article 34  ** member states shall coordinate their action in international organisations and at international conferences . 
  they shall uphold the union 's positions in such forums . 
  the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy shall organise this coordination . 
  **  ** in international organisations and at international conferences where not all the member states participate , those which do take part shall uphold the union 's positions ** . 
   in accordance with article 24 ( 3 ) , ** member states represented in international organisations or international conferences where not all the member states participate shall keep the other member states and the high representative informed of any matter of common interest ** . 
   ** important ** - ** member states which are also members of the united nations security council will concert and keep the other member states and the high representative fully informed . 
  member states which are members of the security council will , in the execution of their functions , defend the positions and the interests of the union ** , without prejudice to their responsibilities under the provisions of the united nations charter . 
   ** when the union has defined a position on a subject which is on the united nations security council agenda , those member states which sit on the security council shall request that the high representative be invited to present the union 's position ** . 
  -- thus even at the un security council , the most senior chamber of the united nations where the uk is supposed to exercise itself independently and act in its own interest , it is bound by the european union . 
  this and all other parts of the treaty referencing foreign policy are clear examples of national sovereignty being reduced on the global stage . 
  people aware of this are n't longing for the uk to have an empire again , but longing for the uk to be its own country again that works in its own best interest . 
  every country has fiscal transfers between its constituent parts . 
  within the uk every country except england has a fiscal deficit . 
  in 2016 scotland received # 15 billion , wales received # 13.9 billion , and northern ireland received # 9.8 . 
  cumulatively , this amounted to # 38.7 billion or $ 44 billion of english money going to other parts of the uk . 
  as a finn you might call that bribing , but the majority of us in the uk and especially england will recognise such funding as the product of the strong bonds between the countries and people of the uk who have a shared history and culture going back 2000 years . 
  england has its own deprived areas . 
  only london , the south east of england and east of england are regions of england that do not also have their own fiscal deficits . 
  this money could be spent in england if england became its own country , but unlike in the rest of europe , england is practically alone as a ` country ' that does n't seek to break away from a larger nation just because it does n't want to fund the rest of its supposed countrymen . 
  you look at spain with catalonia or italy with its northern league and you realise how much stronger the bonds of the uk are than the bonds in such nations where independence referendums could n't even be permitted because of their almost certain breakup . 
  so yes , call it ` bribing ' if you like , but i call it doing what 's right and what 's expected in a union of countries where kinship really does exist . 
  [ data from ons figures , table 2 ` net fiscal balance per head from fye 2014 to fye 2016 , by country and region ' ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/articles/countryandregionalpublicsectorfinances/2015to2016#net-fiscal-balance ), 
  the relaxation of visa requirements between canada and the eu is in no way comparable to the freedom of movement between eu members states . 
  canada only maintains visa requirements today on romanian and bulgarian citizens , which are due to end in december . 
  there will be no increased ` freedom of movement ' between the rest of the eu and canada in exchange for ceta . 
  the uk has visa-free travel with countries like mexico , brazil , but that has n't led to thousands of people from those countries coming to live in the uk . 
  i 'm sure the uk can have a similar deal which eliminates nearly all tariffs while ending freedom of movement with the eu . 
  the uk already complies with all eu regulation and laws on trade so arranging a deal should n't take long either . 
  the uk has an issue with binge-drinking culture , but it 's hardly comparable to american-style opioid and meth epidemics for example . 
  high culture has declined everywhere , but especially so in the usa . 
  the problems with the pakistani community are a reflection of pakistani culture and society . 
  it 's not part of british society , it does n't reflect the uk as a country . 
  there 's little to be done about the refugees already in europe , but the solution is simple . 
  stop essentially collecting refugees and bringing them from the libyan coast to italy , end the involvement of non-government organisations , and send all new refugee arrivals to offshore camps away from the civilian population ready to be sent back when the crisis subsides . 
  while in these camps ( funded with redirected european foreign aid budgets ) sort through and deport all false refugees and send the truly vulnerable in small numbers to eu countries that * want * to resettle them permanently once they 've been vetted . 
  if there 's to be any deal with a country like turkey or libya , pay them to actually take refugees and not just swap one kind of refugee for another . 
  europe is n't getting its money 's worth with this deal . 
  stop deported migrants from returning with something called ` borders ' . 
  the appeal of europe to these economic migrants will quickly fade once word spreads that they are being sent back , that they are n't reaching the european homeland , that they are n't getting houses and money simply for arriving without credentials . 
  there is an endlessly multiplying population of potential refugees , we ca n't accept even a fraction of them if we want to remain ` europe ' and not resemble south africa . 
  i 'm not suggesting we bomb turkey or are aggressive with the country , but the situation with the turkey resembles an extortion racket or blackmail . 
  eu nations should n't need to pay turkey tribute for a weak deal that does n't even reduce the actual number of refugees coming into europe . 
  economic aid to turkey is being doubled just to swap greek island refugees with ` approved ' syrian refugees currently in turkey . 
  we could filter/reject these refugees ourselves without caving into the demands of an unpredictable turkey . 
   but we need to keep looking charitable to do these things because otherwise lybian or turkey leaders might argue whataboutism and simply let them pass to europe instead of taking them in . 
  so europe should be held to ransom by the likes of turkey and libya ? 
  in previous decades europe would have secured itself in this situation by exerting force and influence on these second-world countries . 
  it shows how little influence europe has if it ca n't even enforce its will in its own back garden . 
  weak leaders and cowardly electorates will doom europe to third-rate status , superseded in influence by runt countries like libya . 
  i think europe should play its part in helping out refugees , but we should n't have to go overboard just because europe is closest to the most famous refugee hotspots in syria . 
  refugees can just as easily go to rich countries like japan or south korea , many of whom are closer to other refugee hotspots like bangladesh . 
  despite this however , those countries accept practically zero refugees and now [ the largest contingent of refugees coming into europe now happen to be from bangladesh . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-migrants-bangladesh-libya-italy-numbers-smuggling-dhaka-dubai-turkey-detained-a7713911.html ) europe should n't universally take on this heavy social and economic burden . 
  refugees are not a benefit to our countries , and its not racist or xenophobic to admit this . 
  there are other advanced countries that can share the burden , and even rising powers like brazil and china should play their part . 
  european leaders have been so keen to bring refugees here for political and ideological reasons . 
  most europeans do n't want thousands of refugees here , especially when most coming are n't even real refugees and are economic migrant young men instead . 
  in light of recent events in europe , i 'd go as far as to say that the current crop of ` refugees ' coming into europe actually fundamentally threaten our way of life and our advanced culture . 
  we are n't bringing in people fleeing homophobic persecution for example , [ we are bringing in people who support it instead . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law ), 
  it 's sort of funny but disappointing because this does n't really fit my understanding of ` british humour ' . 
  it 's more american . 
  the ` do n't fucking pass out ' bit feels really misplaced .
