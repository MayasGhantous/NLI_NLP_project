  [ 10 ] theories have been presented by historians , mostly of an expression of roman power and hadrian 's policy of defence before expansion . 
  english heritage refers to the wall as a frontier wall . 
  functioning for 300 years , it likely served many purposes as the level of civilisation north of the wall waxed and waned , becoming a harder border at times of rebellion and attack . 
  in the second/third century the gates were narrowed to only permit pedestrian traffic , which would have limited trade and likely signals a time where the wall was used protectively . 
  regardless , it never served as a pretty gateway for the picts to stroll though at leisure . 
  and also to keep out invading barbarians . 
  [ hadrian 's wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadrian%27s_wall ) [ the great wall of china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_wall_of_china ), 
   working together with people is always better than putting up walls . 
  no it is n't . 
  walls should always be the first line of defence and the first filter against barbarians . 
  the romans and ancient chinese understood that . 
  no one should have an * automatic * right to live in germany but germans . 
   they are already here , let 's work to live together . 
  they 're in germany ... supposedly as refugees . 
  there 's no reason why every single one of them ca n't be sent back to where they came from when the crisis in syria is resolved . 
  who rebuilt [ germany after the ravages of ww2 ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5i9k7s9x_a ) your grandparents , probably . 
  syria will never be rebuilt unless all those who left it go back and rebuild it . 
  they have a responsibility to return to syria and endure whatever hardships are necessary to restore that country for their descendants . 
  they do not belong in europe . 
  europeans do not belong in syria . 
  if we accept that the flow of refugees and migrants will never stop because of war , exacerbated or indeed sometimes caused by global warming ( to which european countries are no longer the main contributors towards , with emissions from the developing world eclipsing centuries-worth of european industrialisation ) then the * only * choice is to build more walls and keep as many people out as possible . 
  nothing can be done about the endlessly multiplying people of africa . 
  they barely have enough food to feed the 1.2 billion of them that already exist , yet by 2100 , nigeria 's population alone is already forecast to increase from 180 million today to upwards of 900 million . 
  there 's no place in europe for even a fraction of these people . 
  having proper borders is n't unnatural or wrong . 
  it 's the most fundamental component of a nation state . 
  they 're certainly not part of the amalgamated british ethnic bloc , and they 're not culturally british either . 
  most pakistanis in britain live in such isolated communities that [ they 've resorted to inbreeding amongst themselves .

   after ww2 we would have never been able to rebuild britain without the help of the muslim immigrants from the colonies , they built modern day britain . 
  lots of things built-up britain after ww2 . 
  people like my grandparents , marshall aid from the usa , advances in technology and so on . 
  muslim immigrants basically did squat all however . 
  immigration controls in britain were only relaxed to allow meaningful levels of immigration in the mid 1960s , 20 years after ww2 ended . 
  immigrants working as bus drivers or in launderettes did n't rebuild this country , which is obvious when you consider that immigration has been and continues to be focused in certain areas in britain . 
  i live in part of britain that 's 92 % white . 
  who rebuilt my area ? 
  most ` migrant ' families in my town are the descendants of italian prisoners of war from ww2 . 
  i 'm grateful for the cafes that they run today , but they did n't build my house or the roads outside it . 
   if you are against multiculturalism and a multiethnic britain then you have no place here and should leave . 
  i was born here . 
  my parents were born here . 
  my grandparents were born here . 
  my great grandparents were born here . 
  my great great grandparents were born here . 
  this is my country . 
  living here is my birthright . 
  living in this country is my inheritance , bequeathed from countless generations of my ancestors who built this country up not just after ww2 but after ww1 , the english civil war , the war of the roses and every single war dating back to before the roman conquest of britain almost 2000 years ago . 
  if that upsets you then maybe * you * should leave . 
   it 's not 100 % free trade . 
  because of that , freedom of movement is limited , but it does happen . 
  -------- there is n't 100 % free trade in the single market either . 
  services essentially run outside of the single market , which is by no means completed . 
  --  the deal also allows 1,800 specialised workers to go from china to new zealand for a period of up to three years . 
  ------ that is * not * freedom of movement . 
  it is the exact opposite , as immigration is limited to an incredibly small number of * skilled * workers ( 1,800 ) and they can only stay for 3 years . 
  contrast that with the freedom of movement between the nations of the eu , through which over 900,000 polish people alone have come to britain , 90 % of whom arrived after 2004 . 
  you must know how ridiculous it is compare the two situations . 
  i 'm all for freedom of movement between the uk and poland if it means only 1,800 skilled polish workers can come here and only for 3 years . 
  ah well that 's all good then . 
   unifying a bunch of insignificant kingdoms is not noteworthy it absolutely was back then . 
  there was n't nearly 200 distinct countries back then like there is today , in fact you can barely consider anything outside europe at that time a ` country ' . 
  [ it was noteworthy enough to lead to the creation of the largest empire in history .

  the acts of union 1707 referred to the newly created country in various names , including the ` united kingdom ' . 
  you have some weird issues regarding use of the term ` united ' . 
  i 'm trying not to be nasty . 
  i do n't know where you 're from , i do n't know how capable you are with the english language , but you do n't seem to be a native speaker . 
  the use of ` united ' is n't supposed to be a boast , it 's a description . 
  what country are you from ? 
  your comment history suggests you live in america but your comments never consist of more than one sentence , which makes me think english is n't your first language . 
  it 's incredibly frustrating talking with you . 
  what on earth are you talking about , you sponge ? 
  the term ` united kingdom ' refers to kingdoms that are united , like the [ united kingdom of the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_the_netherlands ) or the [ united kingdom of portugal , brazil and the algarves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_portugal,_brazil_and_the_algarves ) . 
  what would a better name be ? 
  your previous comment is like a parody . 
  a weird mash up of the vilest views and uninformed opinions of the guardian and independent . 
  it 's just not worth the time discussing this with you when you 're so heavily indoctrinated that you think [ the uk is full of racists ] ( http://theconversation.com/this-map-shows-what-white-europeans-associate-with-race-and-it-makes-for-uncomfortable-reading-76661 ) , and [ that the most recent generation has things worse than their parents and grandparents ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-40003514 ) , among other bizarre views . 
  i 'm not going to sit here and entertain your victim complex . 
   but leavers do n't care much about facts . 
   racist  fuck up our futures  they ca n't stand foreign accents  the vote had fuck all to do with brexit . 
   a second referendum now would be a landslide for remain  suicide plunge off out of the eu . 
  you seem like you can only regurgitate half-dissolved sound bites and buzzwords , so there 's really very little we can discuss . 
  oh cry me a river . 
   rest of the eu would be thrilled to push forward as the most powerful national force in the world without you . 
  the eu combined will never be a meaningful force geopolitically . 
  the european share of global gdp and global population is shrinking . 
  the oecd forecasts the euro area to form just 9 % of global gdp by 2060 , down from 17 % today . 
  for some perspective , japan today forms 7 % of global gdp . 
  a united europe in 2060 will barely be more important than japan is today . 
  [ looking to 2060 : a global vision of long-term growth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnil212tbpk ), 
   i fully believe that had the leave campaign not been allowed to offer outright lies of the benefits of leaving and suggest false options what would the result had been if the remain side was n't allowed to make terrifying claims regarding a [ punishment budget ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36534192 ) , [ recession ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum ) , or even [ world war 3 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/08/cameron-brexit-will-increase-risk-of-europe-descending-into-war/ ) ? 
  i 'd daresay more people would have voted to leave if not utterly scared out of it by the constant barrage of such reports , which were capitalised on and used extensively by the remain campaigns . 
   ( rather than having loads of old racists and very few young people ) racist , really ? 
  ` old people ' built up this country , despite a good deal of them growing up not just with rationing that continued into the 1950s but even in the 1970s when slums still dotted the major cities . 
  why should they pay attention to what some self-absorbed brats want , especially when barely any of them could even be bothered to vote ? 
   this is why hardcore leavers are too scared to have a second referendum because it was a fucking miracle the first one got the slim majority it did , they 'd get steamrolled now people actually know that most of the campaign for leaving was complete and utter bullshit . 
  if there are * so many * people who want to remain in the eu ... why did n't they all vote lib dems , the largest party that is actually calling for a second referendum ? 
  the lib dems got a pathetically small 2.3 million votes .
