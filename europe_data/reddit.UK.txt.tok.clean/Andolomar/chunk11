  is there a smoking culture in austria ? 
  i have a tin of surstromming in my fridge from a drunk purchase and it 's starting to swell . 
  should i open it or call the bomb squad ? 
  if i open it , how should i eat it ? 
  thank you !, 
  oh well it 's the british education system , so it 's not going to be the most up to date , and languages are especially dire . 
  i had my french teacher tell us that when we choose our gcses not to choose spanish because practically nobody speaks it . 
  could you quickly outline the rules on double ss ? 
  i am vaguely aware that it is somewhat different in austria than germany but that 's alright because i 'm currently learning german from an austrian . 
  it seems to be quite common in the areas with celtic languages . 
  i 've seen it quite a bit in brittany , wales , and ireland , but not very often anywhere else . 
  we have things like `` the old brewhouse '' or `` the stables '' , but proper names like `` afan '' , `` dylan '' , and `` ffion '' are quite common in wales . 
  gcse german , six years ago . 
  what about the two kilograms of butter in every dish ? 
  i have complete faith in my government to fuck everything up . 
  mate , nobody actually gives a shit how people use language . 
  you do n't get lads down the pub stopping mid sentence and smacking their foreheads because they accidentally used a verb instead of a preposition . 
  you start picking out all the lexicographical faux pas then people 'll think you 're a weirdy . 
  there 's been reforms ? 
  i was taught to use \u00df for all double ss unless they are capitalised . 
  rammstein deliberately makes it tricky though . 
  the song is `` you have '' , but the american release is `` you hate '' . 
  they also printed `` du hasst '' instead of `` du hast '' in some copies . 
  my friend 's album says `` hasst '' whereas my brother 's says `` hast '' . 
  we only found out because my friend was saying how it should be `` ha\u00dft '' . 
  and then you think you 've got it but they throw in the nein which makes it very ambiguous . 
  i think that whole song is just rammstein having a bit of fun . 
  fuck off you robot ; my folk 've been saying would of since before asimov invented your troublesome kind . 
  unless the incorrect grammar changes the meaning or tense of the phrase , nobody actually gives a shit and even then they can work it out in .2 seconds provided they were n't born with a horrific malady such as a missing brain . 
  i pronounce music with an s. . . devilish dialects are at work again . 
  that 's a dialect thing . 
  have and of rhyme in my dialect ( huv and uv ) , so pronouncing would of and would have sound exactly the same . 
  additionally , of is used to refer to the past , so `` i would have gone to the shops '' is no better than `` i would of gone to the shops '' . 
  google disagrees , but google also disagrees when i type a lot instead of alot so google can jog on . 
  whether or not the use of of influenced the pronunciation of of or mutated into that meaning and then the pronunciation did n't adapt from have is a chicken and egg scenario . 
  we used to have the german r in upper-class english but we lost it sometime in the last century . 
  if you listen to old recordings ( i know of one i can link but i wo n't because it is a very racist old nursery rhyme ) , you can hear it clearly being used . 
  flanders and swann ( comedy music duo from the 50s and 60s ) can be heard using it occasionally , so it probably went out of fashion around then . 
  as english is a germanic language i am entitled to answer . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ course ^ ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ ^ english , ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ entitled ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ everything . 
  double letters is something i still struggle with , especially in referrendum , rennaisance , and neccessary . 
  when i was a lad i would struggle with american spellings , such as dropped us , zs instead of ss , and pronunciations ( i still say skedule rather than shedule ) . 
  also it does my head in that you pronounce your pronunciation . 
  es and as are tricky , like redundent and necessery . 
  a lot of children struggle with tenses . 
  dan swims . 
  colin runs . 
  many kids say swimmed ( although that is also correct , it is n't preferred for some reason ) and runned . 
  nothing at hand i 'm afraid , this is only what i 've picked up from documentaries . 
  the normans generally bred within their own groups and did n't really mix with the anglo-saxon peasantry . 
  many of these norman lines still exist today , so whereas the average briton would have an insignificant amount of norman genes a few families would have a sizeable amount , such as the royal family whom are the direct descendants of william the conqueror . 
  the whole norman/saxon divide in the modern uk is a rich person 's debate : some people take pride in claiming descendancy from the powerful and prosperous normans , others take pride in being the `` true english '' relicts that predate the invaders . 
  i doubt you 'll find anybody who earns less than # 100,000 per annum who actually cares which they are . 
  i worded my previous comment quite poorly . 
  i mean to say that some people have a large amount of norman dna and some people have a large amount of anglo-saxon dna , sort of how like some people are rich and some people are poor , but on the whole we are a rich country . 
  before the uk there was wessex , mercia , northumbria , essex , east anglia , kent , and sussex in england , gwent , powys , gwynedd , dyfed , brycheiniog , builth , seisyll wg , and dumnonia ( now modern cornwall ) in wales , alba , fortriu , and dalriada in scotland . 
  i ca n't speak for scotland or wales , but a lot of relics and remains from this era still survive , and common law is heavily entrenched in the cultures that evolved from this era . 
  most major towns have museums to this era , mine has a very large one because it was the site of the major battle that prevented danish ambitions in england so a lot of things are saxon themed . 
  http://www.historic-uk.com/historymagazine/destinationsuk/anglosaxonsites/ there is an anglo-saxon/norman divide in england , with some people considering themselves to be anglo-saxon , some people considering themselves to be norman , and most people not being particularly interested in that sort of thing . 
  depending on who you ask , it is n't clear if the normans or the anglo-saxons are our true forebears . 
  we 've all got a pretty sizeable amount of dna and culture from both , so it does n't really matter to me . 
  we have a lovely bloke called tony the running man . 
  tony was in the british army but was knocked off his bicycle by a lorry and got massive brain damage . 
  now he runs around picking up litter which he gives to the council , and they pay him for what he collects . 
  he 's been doing it for longer than i 've been around . 
  he 's also ran marathons and has been sponsored by charities . 
  everybody loves tony . 
  people say hello to him in the streets , i 've seen him get free chips from burger vans , [ he was put forwards as a candidate to carry the olympic torch ] ( http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/9140361.bid_for_chippenham_hero_to_be_torch_bearer/ ) but for some reason it went to some random kid who was captain of the footie team at the largest comp , whose only achievement was being the best player in the school . 
  i was trying to get work experience with the police and tony comes in with a great big bag ( about the size of a toddler ) filled with dog shit , and said that dog fouling in the parks has become the town 's disgrace and demanded the council do something about it . 
  he walked off leaving the bag behind and the receptionist asked me if i 'd go after him and give him back his bag of shit . 
  why 's that ? 
  better than anybody in my government , that 's for damn sure . 
  stoic , smart , knows what she wants , good negotiator , sticks to her guns . 
  does n't rile people up , but does n't really excite them either . 
  a few cons : her stance on marriage and adoption rights could do with some work , but i do n't know the political situation in germany . 
  for all i know there is n't much pressure for marriage and adoption egalitarianism , although i doubt that . 
  did n't like the reactionary movement against nuclear power post-fukushima that she presided over . 
  on the whole i 'd say europe is better with her than without her . 
  looking forwards to seeing if she wins the bundestag elections this september , or if schulz is really worth the circlejerk . 
  if she loses i would like to see her take on a role within the eu . 
  growing up , there were literally only two i saw unless i went to london , bristol , or portsmouth . 
  this kid in my year , and a preacher who we could n't work out if he was christian or muslim . 
  now i 'm at uni i see them everywhere . 
  it was quite a shock when i realised that i 've seen more black people in the last two days than i did in the twenty years before that !, 
  then i have been lied to . 
  terribly sorry about that mistake . 
  france . 
  they stole normandy from us . 
  been fishing once or twice , if you can call it that . 
  we just blocked the river to trap a few trout , then once we 'd netted them we demolished the dam . 
  haha with standardised tests all we have to put is name and the date . 
  for gcses , candidate number and centre number . 
  we 're the og america of europe . 
  yea see you could have just been patient and waited 98 years, 
  bus drivers , plumbers , and publicans . 
  a friend of mine at uni is from wien . 
  i 've been learning german ( slowly ) since j\u00e4nner . 
  some of it makes more sense to me than the german dialect , like erdapfel . 
  i remember it because it 's pomme-de-terre in french , and it makes me concerned that peoples other than the french would consider a small , lumpy , dirty , brown , starchy root vegetable to be similar to an apple . 
  if you 're born here , you 're british .
