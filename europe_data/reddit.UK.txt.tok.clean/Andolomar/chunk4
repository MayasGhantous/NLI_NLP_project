  that 's just how british alarms are . 
  they are absolutely useless . 
  we 've set them off with deodorant , people smoking and vaping in their room , candles , taking steamy showers , but the kitchen caught fire once because some imbecile decided to defrost onion rings by frying them and walked away , and there was no alarm . 
  somebody noticed the smoke and the entire worktop was on fire . 
  only two days earlier i set off the alarms by frying mushrooms . 
  there 's nothing we can do about it because the replacements are just as bad , and there is no way to shut the bloody things up apart from pulling all the batteries out and then pulling the fuse on the fusebox because that hush button is just there for show .

   pushing a button to make sure they still work , another push and they are quiet again . 
  see these are the instructions printed on them , but this never works . 
  ever , for anyone . 
  you press the button and it goes off , but pressing it again does n't shut it up . 
  you 've got to hold it down for two minutes to get the bloody thing to shut up , so most people do n't bother . 
  according to some bloke in the main thread on / r/worldnews which i now ca n't find , british apartments are all individually fire protected , so as long as the doors and windows are closed a fire in one apartment will not spread out of the apartment . 
  this means that only one fire escape is necessary , as only the people immediately affected are required to leave . 
  the building was renovated with some really dodgy cladding that was the same type of material responsible for the melbourne and dubai fires . 
  it 's cheap , made from polystyrene wafered between two layers of laminated aluminum . 
  three highly flammable materials covering the exterior of the building . 
  the fire started in an apartment on the fourth floor with an exploding fridge . 
  the owner of that apartment 's alarm went off , but only in the hallway which got him out of bed . 
  the fire spread through the kitchen quickly and exited out the window , where the building 's cladding went up like tissue paper soaked in benzin . 
  the principle of individually fire protected apartments fell apart , as the fire spread rapidly across the exterior of the building . 
  the lack of a centralised fire alarm network , a single fire escape for roughly 300 residents , and it being 0100 in the morning have contributed to the disaster . 
  as of 0500 when the fire was at its strongest , fire and rescue had been unable to reach higher than the third floor . 
  there are twenty three floors .

  edit : posted this in response to the wrong comment . 
  whatever , it stays . 
  i do n't know , we 're pretty fed up with dodgy landlords in this country ... 
  depends . 
  is it just a simple fire alarm in every room or are they all networked ? 
  my apartment has networked fire alarms and they 're a bloody nuisance . 
  if you put deodorant on too close to it , or some idiot lights a candle or vapes in their room then every alarm in the building goes off . 
  we actually did have a fire at the start of the year and there was no alarm . 
  speak for yourself . 
  it 's been one of my favourite insults since primary school . 
  could be . 
  the novgorod republic in polish is rzeczpospolita nowogrodzka . 
  it is certainly similar enough . 
  also , the novgorod republic was part of the hanseatic league , which is sort of reflected in the witcher series as the treaty of lan exeter , permitting kovir and poviss , and novigrad with unrestricted trade . 
  no joke , we pronounce it massedonia ( like , catholic mass ) in britain . 
  i know a bit of russian so i know how the cyrillic letters are pronounced ( in russian of course ) , i was just surprised to see that it is spelled make\u0434o\u043di\u044f instead of mace\u0434o\u043di\u044f . 
  is macedonia pronounced with a hard c ? 
  what is the issue between macedonia and greece ? 
  as far as i understand it , macedonia the state consists of half of the macedonian historical region , with the other half in greece ? 
  edit : cheers guys , i think i get it now . 
  there 's hundreds of novigrads , novograds , and novgorods . 
  it simply means `` new town '' . 
  nah , royal mail are even worse than brishit telecom . 
  trained ravens are the future . 
  we get 4g though which is pretty dank . 
  when i was in school there was no internet , no data , no mobile network whatsoever . 
  fucked up my grades because everything is online . 
  humbly report , 84kb/s here . 
  labour are n't liberals , the tories are liberal !, 
  damn yanks got the meaning of that word backwards , now it 's catching on over here . 
  the new economic policies that modern conservatives promote , that the democrats promote in america , is liberalism . 
  the american 's could n't separate economic liberalism from the rest of the democrat party 's policies so they called everything liberal . 
  our liberal democrats are the us 's democrats , our labour probably would n't be allowed into the american government , and their republicans probably would n't be allowed into our government . 
  bet you we give him a state funeral , for `` services to the commonwealth '' .

  he can use a computer , he 's already more qualified than the competition . 
  dw as a poor briton , we hate the toffs just as much , but it 's not as bad as it was a century ago . 
  i 'm always surprised that we never had a bolshevik revolution in britain . 
  even a failed one . 
  i read a lot of old books and it 's always printed as rumania . 
  maybe they could take up a hobby ? 
  yes , he brought a bottle of something similar back from czechia . 
  to paraphrase douglas adams , drinking that was like having my head smashed in by a plum wrapped around a large gold brick . 
  the main problem we have in the uk is that their lifestyle is illegal . 
  everybody who makes money has to pay income tax , and for whatever reason makes sense to the powers that be you need to have a permanent address in order to do that . 
  no permanent address means no tax paid , and not paying tax is illegal . 
  if you are homeless and you are employed , you are breaking the law . 
  as gypsies roam around the country , they do n't have permanent addresses and they usually make their living through trade . 
  wood carvings are quite common , garden ornaments , whatever can be made nice for cheap and sold for a profit , including drugs which naturally has the highest profits . 
  this means they are not paying tax on their income . 
  another problem is that we have a lot of low income communities in this country . 
  half of my village does n't have a car , and there are very poor transport links , so my village is definitely marginalised . 
  if we want something flash , like a smartphone , or a laptop , or a games console - things that people are expected , even need to have , in this economy - we buy it from the gypsies . 
  they knock on our doors with a van full of goodies and we buy them for cheap . 
  we do n't ask where they come from and we do n't want to know , but it 's the only way we can get these things . 
  i 've bought two laptops , two xbox 360s , and an xbox one off these guys and i 've spent probably a quarter than what they were being sold for in shops . 
  they were all fully sealed and looked like they were fresh off the assembly line . 
  the reason why gypsies behave like this is because we have created an economic niche for them to occupy . 
  we wo n't deal with the gypsy problem until we have dealt with the social and economic problems that necessitate the gypsy lifestyle in local and regional economies . 
  we 're damned if we do and we 're damned if we do n't , to put it bluntly .

  the key details are that van lill had a bit of a cocaine habit , pissed off his `` friends '' , and disappeared . 
  considering that there is only one place you can buy cocaine in these parts and there is only one group of people that will do nasty things to you if you piss them off and they can get away with it , it did n't take people long to start drawing lines .
