i said anti-democratic not un-democratic . 
  i meant it as in it goes against what democracy is supposed to be . 
  and i was referring to the reasoning behind voting , not the act of voting itself . 
  well either they 're uninformed that they 're voting bigots into power or they 're fully aware and happy to do so . 
  ( i am aware that not all ukip members are bigoted but there are plenty who are and have gotten elected for example roger helmer ), 
  no , a lot of people only vote labour because their parents do or vote green because they just do n't like the sound of pollution . 
  it happens with every party . 
  my point is that a lot of people voted for ukip without knowing what they were actually voting for and why . 
  no but how many of ukip 's supporters could actually tell you any of the problems with the eu ? 
  they 're using scare tactics and taking advantage of the lack of political education this country has . 
  most people voted for ukip because `` europe is bad because immigration ! '', 
  and they would n't understand half of what you 've said . 
  i 'm only gon na answer one of your 3 posts - no point duplicating . 
  i appreciate that this is a big issue and i understand why someone would want a referendum . 
  my point is that what happened on thursday does not guarantee a referendum in europe . 
  and seeing as you asked , no i am not against a referendum ( i do n't mind if we have one or not ), 
  my age ? 
  what age would that be ? 
  i would never vote for cameron either by the way, 
  what if i told you ... 
  this post * has * created discussion, 
  voting for a party as a protest because you feel the mps wo n't listen to you is anti-democratic, 
  ukip meps do not a referendum guarantee, 
  i do n't think you understand that people who want to leave the eu are in a minority !, 
  if ukip were some crappy 1 % party then the conservatives would n't be pandering to eurosceptics ? 
  i do n't see that as a huge achievement . 
  i do n't think it 's worth sacrificing proper representation in the second largest democracy in the world just to get one party to pander to a few voters ( especially when they 're not likely to even get into power ), 
  so the message is `` i do n't like the eu as it is '' then . 
  so now the government know ( based on live figures as i type this ) that 30 % of people in the uk do n't like the current state of the eu . 
  this changes nothing . 
  instead , vote for an mep who will vote for things you agree with in the eu , thus making it a better entity . 
  but that would involve learning would n't it !, 
  what is ukip making the other parties do exactly with this `` message '' they 're sending ? 
  it 's pointless in the end because we 'll vote to stay . 
  by having this palaver we only weaken our economy and lose the sway we already have . 
  plus we focus all political debates on europe and ukip instead of domestic issues like the economy , rights , education and the nhs . 
  this is only slowing things down and is an absolute waste . 
  in my opinion . 
  what is this `` message '' exactly ? 
  that europe has too much control ? 
  why give up what control we do have by voting an mep who will do jack shit ? 
  they do if enough people vote for them . 
  and if the point of voting ukip is a referendum on europe then vote conservative as they 've promised this and actually do have a chance of winning . 
  the same way you get any message across . 
  by contacting your mp , voting in the general election , etc. 
  and it depends what the message is . 
  that you want a referendum on europe ? 
  the conservatives offer that . 
  wait til the general election and vote for them . 
  i agree . 
  but in my opinion it 's a stupid way of doing it . 
  aaaarrggghh i ca n't believe the ignorance of ukip voters !, 
  why vote for people into a parliament they wo n't vote in ? 
  want more say in europe ? 
  vote in a party who will represent us !, 
  ukip meps ca n't get us out of the eu !, 
  what is it you think an mep is ? 
  ohhhhh !, 
  thanks , 
  seriously though what is egginess ? 
  i guess it 's worth it if it is the deciding factor when our in/out referendum rolls around , but after that i hope they scrap it . 
  i love the eu and i hope my country votes to stay but also does n't ruin it . 
  for me i 'd say rome . 
  although bruges is very pretty too and i love how york looks . 
  i 'm always surprised when people say paris . 
  i did n't find it beautiful at all , it was just like most other big european cities . 
  i enjoyed paris , do n't get me wrong , but you have to be in very specific places to only see beauty . 
  it would be like saying new york but only judging it on central park .

  i think the only living artist to make it into this thread . 
  yeah the main difference is that english does n't `` deal with it '' like a language such as polish does . 
  i think this probably stems from english being influenced by a vast amount of other languages so one chunk of words follow rule a but another chunk of words follow rule b. 
  [ this chart illustrates quite well what i mean . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/origins_of_english_piechart.svg/677px-origins_of_english_piechart.svg.png ) example : `` wallet '' is of germanic origin and `` mallet '' comes from latin . 
  hence the `` a '' sounds are pronounced differently . 
  and `` ballet '' is french so the `` et '' is pronounced differently . 
  what about `` fird '' can you say `` f '' ? 
  some english accents say `` f '' instead of `` th '' .
