so you oppose the right to self-determination . 
  glad we cleared that up . 
   `` yes '' got 37 % of the electorate . 
  and 52 % of people who voted . 
  which is the relevant thing . 
  i hate to break it to you , but the opinions of those who do n't vote are n't accounted for in a vote . 
   i quite frankly ca n't think of such a scenario . 
  stop dodging the question . 
  i 'll go back to the comment you originally replied to and spell it out for you - if the romanian government decided the country was to become a part of federal europe , but a majority of the population opposed this , who would you support ? 
   but referenda where the winning alternative does n't even require 50 % well yes , i would n't want a minority deciding which state i lived under . 
  ca n't think of a referendum that required anything less than 50 % to win . 
  but back to the point i was making a few comments back that you dodged : would you support forcing a people to live under a different state , even if the majority opposed it ? 
  you can argue semantics all you want . 
  brexit , the polish elections , and so on made it very clear that parliaments do not represent the populations view on all issues - so when one of those issues is on the magnitude of essentially changing what country they live in , it should be made sure that the people actually want that change . 
   but they deem other topics way more important and vote for the bundle there you go . 
  domestic policies are generally the ones that win a domestic election . 
  so you 'd support forcing a people to accept a monumental constitutional change , even if the majority of them were strongly opposed to it ? 
  if parliaments accurately represented the opinion of the people on these issue , you might have a point . 
  but they do n't . 
  just look at poland - a majority in parliament belonging to a eurosceptic party , despite the polish public being one of the strongest supporters of the eu . 
  the people have the right to self-determination . 
  if you 're going to change the very sovereign state they live under , the only moral way to go about it is to seek their direct approval . 
  a decision of that magnitude should really only be taken with the majority of the public explicitly supporting it - unless you want rioting or a civil war , as another user said . 
  i do n't know what they 're complaining about , who * would n't * want to get violated by a sukhoi ? 
   dropping in a ranking brexiteers ( and now the government ) use to justify britain 's importance shows how delusional they are . 
  right , because being 6th instead of 5th means means we 're an irrelevant little island . 
  you 've already directed us to a report that showed the typhoon to be better in air-to-air combat thanks to better radar , irst , weaponry , thrust-to weight etc. , so what 's it going to be ? 
  i could point out the fact that saudi arabia and kuwait also evaluated the rafale , and ultimately chose the typhoon . 
  i could [ link ] ( https://hushkit.net/2015/12/18/typhoon-versus-rafale-the-final-word/ ) you to articles written by a research analyst detailing why the typhoon is a better air-superiority fighter . 
  or i could list the technical reasons for its superiority , as i have above . 
  but clearly none of this would is going to impact the opinion of a desperate troll - so troll away , i 'm not going to waste my time arguing with you anymore . 
  because it highlights how pointless red flag is for directly comparing aircraft . 
  the raptor is by some distance the most capable air-superiority fighter on the planet . 
  just because a typhoon was able to score a few `` kills '' at a training exercise , in an artifical senario , does n't make it a better aircraft . 
  the same applies to the rafale, 
  you really should read the replies you recieve before continuing your shitpost . 
  here , i ; ll highlight the important parts :  ** - they perform specific training exercises . 
  they do n't just send up the aircraft on an equal footing and ask them to shoot each other down . 
  **  ** - typhoon 's have scored kills on f-22 raptors **  ** - the typhoon has a higher higher thrust-to-weight ratio , greater radar range and coverage , and a superior air-to-air armament ** but feel free to continue jerking it to meaningless red flag results if you like , it does n't affect me . 
   and when they meet each other the rafale win every time yeah , at red flag , where they perform specific training exercises . 
  they do n't just send up the aircraft on an equal footing and ask them to shoot each other down . 
  typhoon 's have scored kills on f-22 raptors at red flag before , but no one is seriously going to argue that the typhoon is the the better aircraft just based on that . 
  the facts of the matter are that the typhoon has a higher higher thrust-to-weight ratio , greater radar range and coverage , and a superior air-to-air armament . 
  the rafale may well be a better mult-role fighter than the typhoon , but it 's certainly not a better air-superiority fighter . 
   rafale is a superior dogfighter while typhoon is superior at beyond visual range interception . 
  so it 's saying that the typhoon is a superior air superiority fighter , which is the role it was designed to perform . 
  glad you cleared that up for us . 
  a country would be obligated to deploy it 's military to serve another , regardless of whether that country wants to or not . 
  if your own military is n't under your control , you 're little more than a vassal state . 
   i do n't see how anyone is losing in this you came up with one reason in your own post :  an eu army would put them [ france , germany and italy ] at the service of country that have none, 
   if you have n't already done that ( by opting out ) then the state should do it for you and by that same logic the state should be able to seize all of your property in the event of you not leaving a will . 
  if you agree with that , fair enough , but i sure as hell do n't, 
  it 's your body , regardless of whether you 're dead or not . 
  as another user put , not filling out some paper work should n't give the state the power to violate a persons fundamental right to decide what happens to their body . 
  nobody has the right to your organs , so unless stated otherwise it must be assumed that the person does not want their organs harvested , otherwise you risk impeding their rights . 
  when you die your body should n't by default become the property of the state , for them disembowel as they see fit . 
  that is something i feel you should explicitly agree to beforehand . 
  if no arrangements are made it should default to the next of kin , as is the case with pretty much any other possession you own . 
   the shocker here is that the true value of # 136m will not be re-invested in the nhs good, 
  agreed . 
  i think the point the guy is making is that it 's far more a political term than an actual type of firearm . 
  unlike a label such as `` assault rifle '' , `` submachine gun '' , or `` handgun '' - which all have a distinict set of characteristic - what makes a firearm an `` assault weapon '' is very vague , most of the time simply coming down to how similar it looks to an assault rifle . 
   however i ca n't legally own a shotgun to go clay shooting christ , and i thought the uk was bad . 
  til the eurofighter was an eu project ^ ^ / s, 
  that 's true enough , but i still do n't see that as being reason enough for making it illegal to carry one . 
  i doubt the would-be knifer is going to be overly concerned over whether his blade is legal to carry or not , i mean half the time they seem to be caught wielding bloody kitchen knives . 
  i really do n't get the locking blade restriction , if a safety feature more than anything . 
   i get the feeling that the europeans that are in favor of these eu gun laws do n't really understand the gun laws of their countries or other eu member states . 
  yes , that does always seem to be the case . 
  and when politicians start bandying around terms like `` assault weapon '' , that only get exasperated further . 
  good on them . 
  the eu 's pretense that the reason they want to tighten firearm regulations further is to combat terrorist attacks is either completely false , or hopelessly naive . 
  hollande stands almost zero chance of being re-elected next year , and with a euro federalist like juppe looking most likely to win , the french position on ttip could change faster than you 'd imagine . 
  ev 's all use electric power steering as you would expect , which inherently filters out more feeling than hydraulically assisted power steering does , and a lot less than unassisted steering . 
  the deficit in balance and agility is due to the sheer wight of the batteries , though i imagine they 'll get lighter over the years . 
  ev 's will no doubt become the predominant type of daily use cars soon enough , but i do n't see them becoming the choice of driving enthusiasts for a long time . 
   steering feedback has nothing to do with the type of engine . 
  all electric vehicles , unsurprisingly , have electric power steering , which filters out a lot more than hydraulically assisted power steering , and a hell of a lot more than unassisted steering . 
   if you value throttle response electric is best . 
  instant power all the time ca n't be beat by a gas car . 
  they give you instant torque , not horsepower . 
  both of those qualities then die off pretty quickly as you gain speed . 
   agility is better when you have a low center of gravity . 
  it 's not better when yo car is weighed down by a huge amount of batteries . 
  the best drivers electric car made yet - the tesla roadster - weighed 50 % ( 500kg ) more than the lotus elise it was built on . 
   electric cars will have better balance then any gas car ever will . 
  a battery in the floor and no heavy engine will do that . 
  again , weight . 
  they have a lot of understeer in them . 
   exhaust note is a byproduct of an inefficient engine . 
  having a quiet car lets you drive hard without raising any eyebrows . 
  completely missing the point . 
   i think it 's dumb for car people to fetishize the noise and exhaust fumes of gas cars when the torque and acceleration of electric cars is superior . 
  it 's not nostalgia . 
  real `` car people '' do n't put the objective performance of a car as the no . 
  1 most important thing . 
  they value the overall experience more - the combination of steering feedback , the throttle response , the balance , agility , exhaust note , and so on . 
  the ai cars in that game is far more dangerous than you can ever be , damn idiots driving into the back of my trailer filled with high-explosives . 
  absolutely ridiculous . 
  this always seems to happen , i recall the eu trying to push through some legislation to ban semi-automatics following the charlie hebdo attack , despite the weapons being used in that attack being fully-automatic black market weapons .
