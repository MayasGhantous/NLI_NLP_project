what smear campaign ? 
  he has n't faced anything worse than any other politician would face in his position . 
  it 's politics , or course he 's going to be attacked . 
  if the public have rejected labour everytime they 've had an mid-left platform it does n't take a genius to figure out they 'll probably do it again . 
  yes , there is an outside chance that corbyn might the next election but the probability that he 'll lose and the conservatives will win and the country will have to deal with another five years of austerity , the systematic destruction of the nhs and the education system and theology an disadvantaged will suffer even more . 
  and for why reason ? 
  what will the the have been ? 
  insanity : doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . 
  i can tell you the ones from 1982 , 1982 and 1992 if you want . 
  yeah , and corbyn 's worse still as this poll shows . 
  it 's going to take something special from the tories to put up a leader who 's less popular than corbyn at this point . 
  they could conceivably dig up saville 's corpse and make him the leader of the party i suppose . 
  if corbyn leads labour into the next election i imagine cameron will hang around , an easy victory and three terms in office will be too much for him to resist . 
  otherwise probably boris or osbourne . 
  it 's does n't bode well when you 're already two miles behind the starting line before the race starts . 
  most of the people who voted for him are probably working class , they 've only got themselves to blame . 
  he 's too financially left for most people as well , as well as having too many dodgy friends . 
  the best thing that could happen now is if he willingly retires after a couple of years and a more moderate leader takes over . 
  if corbyns appeal to the left lasts till the next election and a centerist leader can win over swing voters labour might do alright at the next election . 
  i ca n't imagine any one of those people are over 25 , and most of then will be under 20 . 
  never underestimate the arrogance and delusion of the far left . 
  is n't multiculturalism great !, 
  i 'd assume she 'd know something about the subject . 
  i can make a fairly reasonable judgement of the british mentality . 
  big fan of danelaw & viking raiding parties ? 
  if kids are properly supervised it 's not an issue . 
   lastly , gyms are excellent for extra exercise , and/or for substitute exercise when you main sports ca n't be done for whatever reason . 
  i agree with that though , the best thing to do would be to get kids playing sports . 
  there 's tons of studies which indicate the health and pyschological benefits of team sports for young people . 
  i was talking to a russian girl a few weeks ago and i asked her about pootles and she basically said that anyone intelligent in russia knows that he 's basically a corrupt dictator but they have to support him because he 's their leader . 
  such is the russian mentality . 
  okay , it was great for the parts of the world we were n't starving to death . 
  1812-1914 , when we ran the world . 
  also the best period in the history of the world . 
  we do have unemployed people in the uk , i 'm sure we could teach them to use a mop . 
  define ' a lot ', 
  fantasy politics in play once again . 
  ` islam without islam ', 
  the blokes never met geordie women . 
   openly oppose similar = / = the same as . 
  they could resign on mass as he is suggesting , or otherwise quietly undermine the government . 
  no , a mutiny is not coup , especially when it 's in quotation marks . 
  it 's pretty clear the source is talking about mass resignations and a refusal to work with the government . 
   the unnamed general said members of the armed forces would begin directly and publicly challenging the labour leader if he tried to scrap trident , pull out of nato or announce `` any plans to emasculate and shrink the size of the armed forces . '' who said anything about a coup ? 
  come to think of it i ca n't even remember the last time i saw someone smoking a cig in the uk . 
  it used to be that huddling masses would hang around in the rain under a toxic shroud of carthogenics but now i only ever seen people sucking on what appear to be android penises instead . 
  thank god he had n't got a hope in hells chance of being elected then . 
  i 'll have a look next time i 'm in a shop . 
  thank god we 've got a government that protects us from the evils of nicotine ~ ~ and pedophille rape gangs ~ ~, 
  it 's been a few years since i 've smoked but i 'm pretty sure cigs do n't cost that much in the uk, 
  the thing to remember is that in a lot countries a small amount of corruption is considered normal so the public will only consider the big stuff ` real ' corruption . 
  paying countries to take them on the understanding that they 'll return to their countries of origin as soon as it 's safe for them might work as well . 
  i 'm sure poland would be more inclined to help if it was helping their economy and providing jobs . 
  intergration in swedish society working as planned then . 
  it 's spectacularly naive to think these refugees will successfully integrate considering all the problems the west has had with its muslim population over the last few years , but hey , who cares how any children get abused , how many honour killings happen , how many journalists and filmmakers are murdered and how many innocent people are killed in terrorist atrocities as long as we get to massage our egos and tell each other what wonderful tolerant people we are . 
  if you want your military to be effective you 're going to have to spend serious money on it . 
  that 's semantics , it does n't change the argument . 
   spend one billion a year on your own military . 
   spend 10 million a year on euro military . 
   decide to go to war with burkhaburkhastan  eu does n't agree , you can only take your own forces  political opposition and media question why you 've just spent 10 million on military forces you ca n't even use . 
   soldiers from your country who joined the euro army sit in their barracks polishing their boots while soldiers from the national army get killed in burkhaburkhastan . 
  countries would now be paying for two separate armies when they could just have one . 
  i do n't know why it 's surprising , they 've tried everything else so they might as well try this lot as well . 
  and how about situations like iraq when the british pm wanted to use all the british military 's resources but other european countries disagreed with it ? 
  in cases like that it would n't be logical to spend extra money from your budget on an extra military force you ca n't even use . 
  that still does n't get around the idea of who controls it and the dfferent opinions on how it should be used, 
  there you go then , for obvious reasons nations will want their forces under their own control . 
  yeah hes a cunt but on this occasion he 's correct . 
  the conservatives are going to eat labour alive at the next election . 
  what happens when france decided to take military action against bassad but sweden does n't want to ? 
  no he did n't , the recession happened because of global overleveraging and the sub-prime mortgage thing in the u.s , and it did n't even happen until after he was pm . 
  tb , like it or not , was one of the most successful british prime ministers in history . 
   there is a politics of parallel reality going on , in which reason is an irritation , evidence a distraction , emotional impact is king and the only thing that counts is feeling good about it all . 
  beautifully put . 
  that would only be the case until 2020 and then after cameron 's resigned , the eu ref is out of the way and another five years of conservative fuck ups and austerity it would have been an easy win for labour if only they 'd had a credible leader and a platform that appealed to centrists and swing voters , as it is they 've now got a leader who they 'll tear to shreds over his dodgy credentials and has already alienated the moderates in his own party . 
  does it not bother you at all that the conservatives are going to be in power for another decade now ? 
  we 've been taking about 200,000 immigrants a year for the past 5/10 years . 
  shit mounts up pretty quickly . 
   fund wahhabism  indirectly start civil war  refuse to take any refugees  refugees flood europe  europe colonised by muslims . 
  you 've got to admit , it 's a masterful plan . 
  to be fair fair he was probably just happy it was consensual for once . 
  uhh ... yeah , maybe you want to repeat that in syrian , just , y' know , just to make sure ... 
  that 's because polish people can afford food . 
  pretty much anywhere 's nice if you 're rich . 
  somalia 's lovely if you can afford your own private militia . 
  throw in a kebab and a fight and that 's a damn good friday night . 
  was that isis trying to take the moral high ground ? 
  in some ways but the culture lacks a lot compared to places like italy and spain , and we have a lot of social problems that other places do n't . 
  and the weather 's shit . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ moan ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ everything . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ win ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ anything ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ football ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ anymore ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ even ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ god ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ given ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ win ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ everything . 
  i 'm the opposite , i like big cities but i ca n't stand living in villages or small towns . 
  i lived abroad for a few years and it struck me when i came back how insular the u.k is , it 's like everyone lives in this box and no one cares about about anything but shit tv and and getting blind drunk at the weekend . 
  why is that the only possibility ? 
  or that more people are being raped . 
  if any of you actually lived in the uk you 'd probably change your mind . 
  and that 's your choice , so we should also be able to take who we choose . 
  we were promised one and did n't get one , and since the majority of the public are against unrestricted imigration no one should have any problem with it be curtailed . 
  the british people did n't get much choice in the matter . 
  we have free movement from european countries .
