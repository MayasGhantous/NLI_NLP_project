kosovo is 96 % muslim with 1/3 the gdp per capita of romania . 
  it 's as if the eu is actually trying deliberately to fail . 
  so the laffer curve is in fact a curve , i 'm shocked . 
  would they be able to stop an alien invasion ? 
  that seems equally as likely . 
  maybe it 's only unpopular because putin has been against it from the start . 
  the kremlin 's troll factories are a lot more subtle than just saying `` the west sucks '' on internet forums . 
  they 're known to have bolstered euroscepticism in many countries . 
  given our military strength is a function of economic growth i would fully expect russia to try and sabotage a trade deal that 'll help its enemies ' economies grow . 
  there was fighting in so many countries during wwii that syria might have legitimately been the first safe country they could reach . 
  corbyn himself is an anti-semite . 
  he gave a speech at a `` friends of israel '' event and refused to even say the word israel . 
  when a heckler called him out on it he still refused to say it , then his security had to escort him off stage .

  also friends with hezbollah and the ira and a putin sympathiser . 
  the left went too far with their multicultural agenda , now people will never trust them again . 
  only the middle class care about virtue signalling . 
  the migrants are largely priced out of their neighbourhoods anyway . 
  fashionably late to every major war after doing a few years of profiteering first . 
  there 's a very good reason the uk is n't making any claims about post brexit deals , because parties who want to stop us leaving the eu will try to make them seem as unappealing as possible to influence the vote in their favour . 
  i suspect posturing would change significantly if the uk had already left the eu and parties are driven by finding the most profitable deal available , rather than the deal which will sway the referendum in the direction they want it to go . 
  obama will be gone 4 months after the vote and wont be involved in any potential discussion anyway .

  if it 's the best performing healthcare system , then what makes you think it 's `` not correctly funded '' ? 
  i would argue that it 's more cost efficient . 
  it 's only self-serving healthcare workers who want to paint the image that it 's underfunded so they can get paid more . 
  our currency has survived over 1,200 years , yours looks like it might not survive 20 . 
  good , i hope the uk leaving will cause all the other wealthy countries to leave soon after . 
  germany can stay in and take care of their empire of poverty . 
  the rest of you ungrateful continentals should have given us what we wanted . 
  more like germanistan . 
  it 's not irrelevant since the discussion was about the benefits to workers of moving towards a us free-market system that the tories favour and that you 're trying to criticise . 
  congratulations on your excellent cherry-picking skills , comparing figures from two different sources and not adjusting for ppp you 've managed to find a figure showing only a 4 % gap . 
  if you look at a variety of measures of average income , measured in the same way and adjusting for ppp however , you 'll see that americans earn [ 46 % higher median disposable income and 25 % higher gross per capita income according to gallup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_household_income ) [ 46 % higher median income per equivalent adult according to oecd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_household_income#oecd_statistics ) [ 48 % higher mean gross income according to oecd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage ) [ 6 % higher mean wage in 2009 according to the ilo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage#international_labour_organisation_.28ilo.29_statistics ) [ 31 % higher gross mean wages according to unece ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage#unece_2011_statistics ) [ 44 % higher per capita household income according to oecd 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/household_income#per_capita_household_income_.28oecd.29 ) [ 23 % higher mean and 25 % higher median equivalised disposable household income according to lis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/household_income#mean_equivalized_disposable_household_income_.28ppp.29_.24 ) and although gdp per capita is an imperfect measure , the us ranges between 36 % -45 % higher according to the imf , world bank and cia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita do n't discount this difference as irrelevant . 
  if you want to judge the american free-market system then judge it on the long-term results , not your short-term ideals . 
  increasing income should be the single most important factor to the `` average worker '' and free markets have consistently done a far better job at it than planned economies have . 
  do you know what the average worker earns in the us ? 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  support them by spreading the problem across the rest of the continent probably . 
  in northern ireland we have our own type of [ pastie ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nbet8fz.jpg ) , which differs from the [ cornish pasty ] ( http://i.imgur.com/01fgwjb.jpg ) popular in the rest of the uk . 
  our pastie is basically a hamburger shape made of pork and potato then coated in batter . 
  it can be bought in a chip-shop and is usually eaten with chips or in a bap/bun . 
  ridiculous comparison , but it makes a nice change to use mussolini instead of hitler . 
  ** 3 main pro-federalist groups : ** epp - 80 % in favour s&d - 93 % in favour alde - 87 % in favour ------------------ ** 3 main anti-federalist groups : ** ecr - 83 % against enf - 95 % against efdd - official group stance was against the resolution but italian members rebelled ( 36 % against/31 % in favour/33 % abstain or did n't vote ), 
  71 % of all french people , so what percentage of ethnic french are in favour ? 
  80-90 % probably . 
  i hope he 'll have the decency to offer another referendum on the altered treaty , rather than make a tiny change and say it 's enough to force it through because it 's now a different treaty to the one that was rejected . 
  let me guess , the epp voted in favour of the motion after pis left them to join up with ecr ? 
  doing a deal with facebook to ban anyone that speaks out against mass immigration . 
   a 1950s-and-earlier-style `` woman is the homemaker '' approach seems horribly expensive , since you sacrifice half of your society 's specialized labor force in terms of productivity , it does seem like a massive loss , but this does n't directly translate to wages and quality of life . 
  i 've seen research suggesting that average household income in real terms is the same for modern two earner families as it was when only the men worked . 
  effectively doubling the labour force has put downwards pressure on wages . 
  the uk and other european countries have tried subsidising childbirth and it led to increased welfare dependence , poor people having massive families they ca n't afford and more children growing up in poverty which leads to problems such as criminality . 
  the socialist party in the uk brought in hundreds of thousands of third world immigrants and then paid them to outbreed native brits . 
  increased child benefits seem to have little effect on local populations , but large effects on third world immigrants . 
  the mayor of some swedish city was secretly filmed admitting that `` the muslims are very good at exploiting this '' . 
  the conservatives have recently introduced more free childcare for families with 3-4 year olds and there 's talk of extending this to 1-2 year olds . 
  children in the uk generally start school at 5 , so this would allow mothers to return to work sooner . 
  however the policy gives free childcare whether the mother works or not , so it has led to many mothers leeching off the state so they can have more free time to themselves without working . 
  imo this should only be offered to parents who are in work . 
  personally i would favour some sort of social engineering over mass immigration to solve the problem . 
  i 'm not sure we can rely on technology as this path does n't seem to have worked for japan . 
   are disabled people in the uk provided with a higher standard of living than non-disabled and merely unemployed ? 
  yes , the current conservative government has recently taken steps to rectify this problem for people with minor disabilities , but the socialist party have been hysterical about taking money away from the disabled . 
  they also required people to prove they 're disabled instead of just taking their word for it , which is also being portrayed as inhumane treatment by the left . 
   the uk as a whole has failed to produce a formula that results in maintaining population with two income earners being the norm partially correct , the uk has a birthrate above the replacement rate , although this is partially due to the higher birthrate of muslims , which is tied to their unwillingness to work . 
  we also have high levels of european migration fuelling our growing population . 
  we certainly do n't have the same ageing population problem as germany or japan . 
  in the long-run i do n't think any developed country has a workable formula to maintain its working population while treating women as equal citizens , [ see some of my previous research into the subject . 
  one stat i 've read is that the average net worth of jews in america is 5x that of non-jews . 
  thousands of people also protested when he won the election , it 's the same people still feeling butthurt because their party lost . 
  the conservatives ' strongest opponents are mainly students who think decisions are made based on who shouts the loudest . 
  they even protested the conservative party conference which is an important part of the democratic process and spat at people as they entered . 
  efficient ? 
  the uk steel works were losing money hand over fist because their union demanded an unreasonable pension scheme and payrises even for departments that were losing money . 
  if the people losing their jobs want to blame someone they should blame themselves . 
  a greek criticising another country 's tax avoidance record ? 
  much more shocking than the 5.9 % unemployment rate is the fact that 69 % of working-age muslim women are economically inactive , not even looking for work , and 24 % are claiming a disability . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/london-wikileaks/8304838/uk-muslim-demographics-c-re8-02527.html ), 
  do you apply the same logic of consent to other transactions ? 
  if an employer wants to pay someone below the minimum wage and the employee consents to work for less than the minimum wage , does the state have a right to `` interfere with their freedom '' if both parties consent ? 
  i think a bunch of the wealthy countries should threaten to leave at the same time in order to force the eu to change . 
  i 'm not opposed to any type of union , i 'm just opposed to the current union we have . 
  what an embarrassment for the country that has often been cited as an good example for locking up their corrupt bankers , yet it turns out their own pm was a crook . 
  if he inherited it then he will have paid taxes on it . 
  some people are desperately trying to smear cameron with this in any way possible , but he 's done nothing wrong . 
  what 's hypocritical ? 
  asking about the previous tax affairs of a deceased person is n't remotely comparable to a surveillance program aimed at preventing terrorism . 
  except evading tax is always a crime , avoiding tax is a normal business practice . 
  in fact failure to minimise your tax expense could conceivably be a breach of fiduciary duty and it can therefore be a crime not to avoid tax . 
  evading tax is illegal , avoiding tax is n't . 
  they 're not the same thing . 
  nobody has accused his father of evading taxes . 
  he was an investment fund manager , so there 's probably quite a bit about his finances that the 15 year old david cameron did n't know about . 
  as for putin 's friend , i think it 's only relevant if he made his money through corruption and his links to putin . 
   david cameron did n't hide any money , his father might have back in the 1980s when david cameron was a child . 
  david cameron did n't hide any money , his father might have when david cameron was a child . 
  has the german government stopped pretending these refugees will go home once the war is over ? 
  migrant quotas will save you . 
  there 's a column for net .
