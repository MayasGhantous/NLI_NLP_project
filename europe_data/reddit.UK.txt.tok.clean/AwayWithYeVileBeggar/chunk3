  or giving advice . 
  i was complaining about whether or not i had enough money for the train the other day , and some guy told me to go online and do it with my card as they have that now . 
  that 's good . 
  or if somebody asks me whether or not this is the bus that `` goes to x '' , i 'm fully fine with helping them out . 
  but random conversations about my life or my day are unwelcome . 
  is there any need ? 
  i just want to buy my shit and get out . 
  now i 've never seen it as a `` shocking event '' for someone to hold open a door for you . 
  we do it all the time and always smile and thank people for doing it . 
  maybe continentals do that but i 've never experienced it in england . 
  it 's fucking brilliant , please try it . 
  yeah i think i knew most swear words by the time i was 13 . 
  it 's just unavoidable once you hit secondary school . 
  and depending on the workplace , sometimes swearing is ok and sometimes it is n't . 
  if you work in an office i can imagine that swearing would put you on the spot . 
  i work in industry so even my bosses swear in conversation . 
  whenever i imagine sweden i think of beyond the wall in game of thrones . 
  i just always associate mosquitos with africa and south america . 
  we have grime . 
  basically some some secondary school kids put on puffy jackets and go to a dank ( not * that * meaning ) street corner on a rainy day , then talk fast to a beat while shaking their hands around like they 've got parkinson 's . 
  someone records it on their phone and puts it on youtube titled something like `` rewindz - days on the grind '' . 
  how is it not too cold for them ? 
  especially in the northern parts . 
  we say `` friend that 's a girl '' if we do n't mean girlfriend , usually . 
  but then again that 's 4 ( 5 ) words when we could just use one . 
  i work in a place with many polish workers and when they speak to each other i hear `` kurwa '' * all the time * . 
  it 's like one of the only polish words i know . 
  we used `` full '' for food and `` quenched '' for drink '' . 
  quenched is a germanic word , but i do n't know what it is in german , or if modern german even has it . 
  it comes from old english so maybe we 're the only ones ? 
  window . 
  even germany uses the latin word for this . 
  i think only english and north germanic languages ( norwegian , swedish etc ) use the word `` window '' as opposed to some form of `` fenster '' , in europe at least . 
   old school american diner these are fucking amazing . 
  i get a burrito and curly fries usually . 
  i fucking love sitting in a 50s themed diner with good music , good food and a vast open landscape with only a stretch of motorway to break it . 
  spiders and moths . 
  i have crickets actually living in my room though , but that 's because i own a lizard . 
  how the fuck do you get mosquitoes in sweden ? 
  we do n't even have any in the uk . 
   but some people are more uptight about them , especially when you get words like c * nt . 
  now that depends which part of the country you 're from . 
  where i 'm from ( northern england ) , cunt is pretty common and is not taken too seriously . 
  most guys will call their friends cunts on a fairly regular basis . 
  but if you called someone a cunt sincerely it would be seen as a big fucking issue and is probably one of the worst you could use . 
  i think here most words are fine when talking informally between friends , wherever you are . 
  i work in a place where swearing is about as common as normal speech so i 'm really desensitised to it at this point . 
  the only people i do n't swear in front of are my parents . 
  but yeah , words like fuck , shit , bastard , twat , cunt , wanker , tosser are common and you will hear them all over the place . 
  like if you 're queuing at mcdonald 's or something you might overhear one guy say to another `` it 's a complete bastard , mate . 
  i fucking hate doing it '' for example . 
  it would n't turn any heads or raise any eyebrows as long as they were both older teens or adults . 
  however , if there are children around it 's definitely frowned upon and someone might even tell them to shut up . 
  i 'd say swearing is part of british culture honestly . 
  we have so many interesting swear words and can combine random things into a string of rage-induced art .

  they 've got all the scandinavian names . 
  probably depressing because they were founded on rape and slaughter . 
  berlin is the centre apparently . 
  from there everything goes outwards . 
  say hello to [ this ] ( http://preview.turbosquid.com/preview/2014/07/11__16_11_18/trident_01_01.jpgf64cccb7-6e00-4e2d-933a-1e9b9e4beb1doriginal.jpg ) for me . 
  britannia rules the waves !, 
  ca n't tell what the fuck he 's saying , in the bar scene . 
  sounds like he 's speaking some kind of scandinavian mash-up . 
   return gibraltar back to us !, 
  come and take it from us . 
  we bloody well dare you !, 
  no , shameless is filmed in manchester , which is about 80 miles from nottingham ( northwards ) . 
  i 've never been to manchester so do n't know the accent , but from what i 've seen/heard they have a pretty different accent from nottingham people . 
  agreed , nottingham ( shire ) tends to have the most straightforward accent . 
  no trills , frills or rolls , they seem to just have the most plain english accent around . 
  i speak northern english as well . 
  i 'd say by far the biggest difference is the `` a '' pronunciation . 
  i also use greeting like `` all right lad '' , but in my dialect it sounds like `` ulreyt lad '' . 
  also we call cobs , cobs and not `` rolls '' . 
  some people call them baps . 
  also , i thought everyone used mardy ? 
  do they not use it in the south ? 
  a common phrase is `` mardy bastard '' if someone 's being ... a mardy bastard . 
  i think i heard that midlands/north english is the closest to natural english . 
  i know there 's `` proper '' english , but i think that natural english sounds a lot better .

  spain has british tourism locked down . 
  older folks go to italy , but the majority of our tourism goes to spain and/or france . 
  we like to get away from the rain and burn our white flesh to a crisp on mediterranean beaches . 
  i 'd say it * was * germany . 
  after brexit it 's france . 
  oh i was saying that my comment was irrelevant , not yours . 
  i get what you 're saying , i agree . 
   0.09 % of china 's population voted leave completely irrelevant , but put into perspective , that is fucking insane . 
  them and their shitty armour are no match for my swadian cavalry charge . 
  yes indeed . 
   similarly turkey in 66th place needs to pull its socks up . 
  also needs to be in europe . 
  yeah i stopped using it when i was downvoted for saying that the military is * not * exclusively filled with baby-killing psychopaths . 
  that sub has more venom in it than an inland taipan .
