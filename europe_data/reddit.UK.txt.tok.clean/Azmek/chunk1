although it 's become warped to mean `` crackpot theory that ca n't possibly be true '' , the original meaning of `` conspiracy theory '' is literally just `` a theory that a group of individuals are secretly conspiring with one another '' . 
  maybe if you stopped just saying `` this is my opinion , everybody is entitled to one '' and explained * why * you think it 's inappropriate , everybody else would stop downvoting you . 
  japan 's not that much better , to be honest . 
   it 's the only small or newly created country that spies on allies . 
  no , it 's only the small or newly created countries whose intelligence services are incompetent enough to get caught doing so . 
  i do n't really see how the two cases are comparable . 
  the mass sexual abuse was n't reported because it was coercive rape of children . 
  in many cases , the victims were ashamed , or thought that they would be hurt or punished if they came forward . 
  the ones responsible were viewed by the public as trustworthy authority figures . 
  contrast this incident , which was a violent attack on public transport . 
  factor in the anti-refugee sentiment in many newspapers and a noteworthy portion of the population and the fact that the perpetrators were refugees , and you have the recipe for a next-day headline . 
  never have i been more glad to see a full stop . 
  did n't brooks get cleared on some bullshit technicality or something ? 
  i was thinking more of the floor-level journos who shoulder the blame and then actually do jail time . 
  not technically `` no consequences '' . 
  all the blame gets shunted down onto `` rogue employees '' who are fired and can probably never find work again , while those in charge wash their hands of the incident . 
  then the paper closes down for a month and reopens with the same staff but a different name , and everything is considered sorted . 
  this kind of terrorism is more about symbolic attacks than material attacks . 
  the perpetrators are more concerned with causing as much fear and panic as possible than necessarily killing the maximum number of people . 
  he still has n't really had any comeuppance for the atrocities he committed while in office ( depending on how the chilcot report turns out he may be convicted of war crimes ) . 
  yes , we hate him pretty unanimously , but a lot of us are still waiting for him to get the punishment he deserves . 
  during the collapse of the news of the world and the leveson trial here in britain , i 've heard the words `` one rogue employee '' so many times that they 've lost all meaning . 
  i think most leftists are quite reasonable . 
  i agree with a lot of leftist policy . 
  but the loudest and most outspoken individuals on that end of the political spectrum always seem to be the puritanical , holier-than-thou types who attack everybody and everything -- even other , more moderate leftists -- when they do n't perfectly line up with their ideology . 
  to people like that , actual debate and the active pursuit of equality play second fiddle to their own desire to feel moral superiority . 
  and their voices color public perception of leftism as a whole . 
  it 's essentially an empathy thing , yes . 
  `` if you 're trying to stand up for a disadvantaged group or otherwise comment on issues affecting them , you always need to remember that you 're not them , and consider how * they * feel before opening your mouth . '', 
  i could think `` racism is horrible '' and try to write a story with this message , with the kkk as the bad guys or something , but if i hand all the major victories to white heroes without noticing because i never consider my white privilege , the message i actually send is `` other races are weak and need noble whites to stand up for them '' , which is offensive and contrary to my intentions . 
  essentially , `` privilege '' is the mental ability to not think about negative things when they do n't effect your demographic . 
  for example , i 'm a guy . 
  i 'm also a writer . 
  when i 'm writing stories , i often give conscious thought to how i portray women -- for example , i try to avoid creating a story where the only characters who have agency are male . 
  however , when i read books ( or watch tv or whatever ) , i 'm capable of enjoying stories with exactly the elements i try to avoid writing . 
  if a story is well-told , i can enjoy it even if none of the female main characters have any agency , or all their character arcs hinge on the way they relate to a man . 
  and that is n't because i 'm somehow okay with it ; if i think about those stories on an intellectual , analytical level , i think that they 're flawed and that the way they portray women is wrong . 
  however , when i 'm reading those stories , i 'm just able to shut down that part of my brain , not care at all about the gender equality , and just enjoy the rest of the story for being good . 
  women do n't have that ability , essentially . 
  the same way a professional mma fighter finds it impossible to suspend their disbelief and `` just enjoy '' an unrealistic movie fight scene , a woman ca n't ignore the way their gender is being portrayed and `` just enjoy '' a story like that . 
  overall , they might still like the story , the same way that the fighter might still like the film if the plot is good enough . 
  but even if they do , the fact that there was only one major female character and she was just the girlfriend who kept getting kidnapped ( or whatever ) will always marr the experience for them a little . 
  the ability to just shut off that reaction and appreciate the story as if it was flawless is `` male privilege '' . 
  women have to think about issues that affect women , but i do n't . 
  i can acknowledge , understand , and debate those issues , but i also have the option of ignoring them and just enjoying myself . 
  i have the `` privilege '' of being able to choose . 
  that 's all privilege is . 
  it 's the fact that members of an advantaged group ( men , white people , etc ) have the option of ignoring issues that affect disadvantaged groups , and can just enjoy life regardless of the inequality . 
  the instruction to `` check your privilege '' is essentially just asking somebody if they 've really considered an issue from the perspective of the disadvantaged group being effected , or whether they 're just talking selfishly from their own , more advantaged perspective . 
  there 's nothing wrong , for example , with wealthy people participating in activism , but if they 're doing something on behalf of the poor that 's well-intentioned but poorly thought out , and does n't actually take into account the reality of what being poor is like , then they 've failed to consider ( or `` check '' ) their privilege as a wealthy person . 
  the left wing has a long track record of attacking itself . 
  it 's so much easier to attack other people who claim to have the same moral values and good intentions as you , but who behave slightly differently , than it is to pursue attack people with a fundamentally different philosophy who do n't agree with your values or your priorities at all . 
  no matter how far left somebody is , there will always be somebody a bit further left ready to pounce on them for `` not being true to the cause '' when they do something a little different . 
  in my experience , this tends not to happen when people actually sit down and have proper , well-reasoned conversations and debates . 
  i did n't even fully understand or appreciate the concept of `` privilege '' until a leftist friend and i discussed it at length ; at the end of the conversation , i ended up agreeing with her . 
  but in this internet age , so much of what 's said is single-sentence sound bites on forums and message boards , or people 's knee-jerk reactions to article titles without reading the content . 
  there 's no room for that kind of intelligent debate . 
  instead , the ones who thrive are unnecessarily puritanical individuals , who primarily aim to make themselves feel morally superior by `` exposing '' others as `` not real leftists '' . 
  in my opinion , freedom of speech -- yes , even hateful speech -- is vital for an intelligent and educated society . 
  if you disagree with something , you need to cogitate on your own beliefs and develop your own reasoning enough that you can argue against it in a convincing fashion . 
  not just shut it down for being `` politically incorrect '' . 
  so there are 306 conservative seats , 258 labour seats , and 56 snp seats . 
  if the majority of labour and the snp are against brexit , and the conservatives are split fairly evenly ( which was the impression i got from the referendum campaigning ) , then that ought to fall strongly in favor of `` against '' . 
  i do n't know what the exact numbers are , though . 
  there are two parties acting here . 
  in the context of `` what should france do next , considering they have done this ? 
  '' , it seems fairly reasonable to bring up the us if op thinks that france should be calling for them to be investigated . 
  if we limit the discussion to just `` is france right/russia wrong , yes/no '' , that seems unnecessarily restrictive ( especially considering how obvious the answer is ) . 
  ... and what , i 'm supposed to trawl through every redditor 's comment history before replying to anything ? 
  `` i think i 've already won this argument in the past '' is not license to not make an argument . 
  if writing it out is really * so much effort * for you , at the very least you could link your previous response . 
   dude , you yourself used the argument that i do n't understand the concept , while it seems that you 're the one missing the point of it ... 
  i said that you did n't understand the concept , and then laid out exactly how the concept works and the ways in which it did n't apply to op 's comment . 
  you just retorted with `` no you !, 
   and that was op 's sole point . 
  if it was , it would be simple to rewrite his comment into something that actually achieves that . 
  as it is , it fails to deflect or silence criticism by merit of * actively affirming it * . 
   that 's what i can say about you !, 
  because why attempt a logical refutation or other such strenuous methods of argument when you can just reply `` i know you are , but what am i ? '' . 
  if you want to have an adult conversation about this , i 'll be glad to comply . 
  but if you 're just going to behave like a child , it would be better for both of us if you just did n't bother . 
  you seem to fundamentally misunderstand how tu quoque arguments work . 
  the purpose of the appeal to hypocrisy is to deflect or silence criticism ( by attempting to discredit the critical entity and drawing attention away from the criticized entity ) . 
  an argument fails on the most basic level to qualify as tu quoque if it * fully agrees with the criticism leveled against the first entity * . 
  besides , it 's disingenuous to suggest that bringing up the us is some huge swerve off-topic . 
  even disregarding the fact that [ they made the same statement as france several days earlier ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-37590014 ) , they 're deeply involved in the syria conflict , and have themselves been accused of knowingly attacking civilian targets . 
  in a thread about potential war crimes committed in that conflict , i 'd say that any country in their situation would be fair game for criticism . 
  except that the us said the exact same thing [ a few days earlier ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-37590014 ) . 
  this is n't a groundbreaking suggestion from france , this is follow-the-leader behavior in regard to one of their most powerful allies . 
  that considered , it seems inappropriate to leave the us out of the conversation . 
  because the us did it [ three days earlier ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-37590014 ) . 
  considering that they 're allies , this is less a groundbreaking suggestion and more following-the-leader on the part of france . 
  reread his comment . 
  he 's not absolving russia of criticism . 
  he explicitly used the word `` also '' -- he thinks that they should * both * be investigated for war crimes . 
  this is n't a case of `` whataboutism '' . 
  / u/mcakkeezz is * not * implying that the us 's behavior somehow invalidates any criticism of russia . 
  in fact , he * explicitly * uses the word `` also '' -- he thinks that both russia * and * the usa should be investigated . 
  i suggest you read / u/ras _ syndrome 's [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56r3tl/france_just_called_on_russia_to_be_investigated/d8m0j87?context=1 ) , as he breaks it down in more detail than me . 
  this sub seems like one of the only corners of the internet where tu quoque has overtaken the strawman argument for the title `` logical fallacy people are most frequently falsely or mistakenly accused of '' .
