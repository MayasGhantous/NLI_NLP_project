it 's also much cheaper than paying to train a new soldier and ship him + his supplies to machinegunistan when you get one killed by trying to neutralize the mg without it . 
  this is true , but that job could be done much more cheaply - things like the fire-and-forget mode , top-attack capability and tandem heat warhead do nothing to make it more effective in that role . 
  the price is sort of justified , in that the missile was first conceived as a way to give a very high probability of a lethal hit on a soviet tank worth at least four times as much as the missile . 
  the cost of the system only starts to look silly when it gets used against a machine-gun nest in afghanistan . 
  i suppose it reflects the wider issue that military equipment is procured chiefly for a symmetrical conflict that probably wo n't happen , leaving the men on the ground to find unintended ways to re-purpose equipment for counter-insurgency work . 
   their own good os which at that point was still viable still using my nokia n900 ; still do n't see a viable replacement for it ... 
  head of a major microsoft division leaves ms to become nokia ceo 2 . 
  the guy from microsoft make a serious of apparent blunders , destroying 80 % of nokia 's share value in just a couple of years ( he even wrote a memo unfavourably comparing nokia to a burning oil rig , and [ leaked it to the media ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2011/02/09/full-text-nokia-ceo-stephen-elops-burning-platform-memo/ ) ) 3 . 
  microsoft buys nokia 's phone business at its new , cheap price 4 . 
  just before the acquisition is completed , the microsoft man moves from ceo to head of nokia devices & services , so he 's running a major division of microsoft again why is this not considered a major scandal ? 
  practically everything he did as ceo of nokia was consistent with intentionally lowering the value of the company , and it seems like he had ample motives to do so . 
  the english word comes from fencing , not from day-to-day french usage . 
  ( it is used to acknowledge that your opponent hit you , since fencing traditionally relies on an honour system for scoring . ), 
  i would guess that french fencers use it ( or used it at some point ) , but it has n't caught on in the same way it has in english . 
  addicts are less likely to seek medical treatment ( both for help stopping , and for potential overdoses ) if they fear that making themselves known to authorities might put them at risk of arrest . 
  also , portugal stepped up treatment/harm reduction programmes at the same time , so it might not all be directly related to decriminalisation . 
  however , would love to know how much of the harm reduction was paid for by the savings made on enforcement . 
  drugs are not `` legalised '' in portugal ( you ca n't just go and legally buy heroin as if you were buying alcohol ) . 
  they are `` decriminalised '' ( drug * users * are treated as patients rather than criminals ) . 
  users still source drugs from illegal dealers with unknown standards of quality , and the dealers are still subject to criminal penalties . 
  the article title seems to be pure clickbait ; since the very first words are  norway has overtaken russia as ** western ** europe 's top gas supplier ( my emphasis . ), 
  well , looks like nobody can draw dolphin faces . 
  guessing before clicking the link : moldova or romania ? 
  well , the whole reason ni exists is that a bunch of anglo-saxons settled in that bit , so it does n't get to be in the celtic union . 
  it 's usually `` debunked '' by quoting the price of building one extra f-35 * now * as the `` unit cost '' , and comparing it to that of other aircraft . 
  this figure is many times lower than ( total cost of the program/number of aircraft procured ) , because it excludes the program 's extraordinary development costs to date , which was shared by partner countries like denmark . 
  [ this is a decent guide to different ways of measuring aerospace unit costs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:askari_mark/understanding_aircraft_unit_costs ) ( please note that it 's not an actual wikipedia article ) . 
  comparing flyaway unit costs also ignores operational and support costs , which are estimated at over $ 30,000 per flight hour for the f-35 ( versus $ 4,700 for the saab gripen ) . 
  it 's a tradition that comes from large , printed headlines on actual newspapers . 
  denmark [ is an f-35 development partner ] ( http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/f35/global-partnerships/f-35-denmark.html ) , and is surely going to buy f-35s at some point because of the sunk costs . 
  talking of the bnp : they had half a million votes last election , making them the fifth party . 
  this election , they have half as many votes as the omrlp . 
  it 's still a cheap , nutritionally inert filler made from wood . 
  i 'm happy to call it `` sawdust '' because i do n't think the extraction of a bit of lignin changes the nature of a centuries-old scam . 
  and they have sawdust in their cheese ... 
  i 'm actually serious !, 
  that 's one of the reasons `` kraft 100 % grated parmesan cheese '' ca n't be sold in the eu . 
  the ingredients refer to sawdust as `` cellulose powder to prevent caking '' . 
  ( there 's been some legal trouble over this practice , but only because some brands used too much cellulose - under 4 % is legal . ), 
  absolutely massive bribes flowing in every direction . 
  edit : it 's accepted that bribery and kickbacks are `` just how they do business '' in the kingdom . 
  as such , [ western governments turn a blind eye ] ( https://next.ft.com/content/ddaebb48-ed78-11e4-a894-00144feab7de ) to the irregularities that occur when western companies deal with the saudis . 
  it 's likely that every major deal with saudi arabia involves similarly terrifying sums of money going somewhere untraceable ( in the case i linked above , it took the form of fees to shell companies performing non-existent consulting services ) . 
  the thing that 's bothering me is this : why should we just assume that all of the missing money ends up in the bank accounts of saudi princes ? 
  there seems to be no good reason to believe that our own decision makers are n't getting their cuts , and it would go a long way towards explaining their insistence on maintaining such a counterproductive alliance . 
  edit 2 : apparently the ft is paywalled . 
  seems like a google referrer is enough to get past it , so , [ first results of this search ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=%22ministers+cite+security+in+effort+to+block+details+of+saudi+deal%22 ) . 
  this must be how people from `` holland '' feel . 
  amongst other problems , this map ignores the british empire 's involvement in the post-wwii occupation of japan . 
  is it actually indoors ? 
  you 're quite right about britannia minor ; it 's common enough knowledge that the term referred to bretagne/brittany . 
  however , the bit about john dee is transparently irrelevant , since equivalents of `` british isles '' in other languages have been used since antiquity . 
  much was still written in latin at the time , so it 's a rather dull coincidence that the earliest surviving usage * in english * happens to come from a notorious imperialist . 
  by the way , why on earth would you call the whole lot the `` irish isles '' ? 
  do you actually , seriously , think that gb , the isle of mann , the hebrides and so on should properly be called `` irish '' ? 
  if not , what point are you trying to make here ? 
   eu and usa are pretty good at demanding from countries a lot and giving little in return . 
  ah , the `` make mexico pay for it '' answer . 
  so ... you 're going to give them citizenship of that country/make that country take them how exactly ? 
  `` british isles '' is a geographical term . 
  saying that ireland is part of the british isles is no more political than saying that canada is part of the americas . 
  ** rolls-royce motor cars limited ** is a subsidiary of bmw , which now holds the rights to the rolls-royce car marque . 
  however , branding is pretty much the only thing they acquired relating to the old rolls-royce company , and the cars have no engineering in common with classic rolls-royces . 
  all rolls-royces built today use bmw engines . 
  ** rolls-royce holdings plc ** is an entirely different company , that * is * descended from rolls-royce limited . 
  it makes engines , mostly big engines for marine , military and aerospace applications . 
  about half of new airliners are powered by rolls-royce turbofans . 
  * very * confusingly , although rolls-royce does n't make automobile engines any more , volkswagen still manufactures a engine designed by rolls-royce , which they use for their bentley marque . 
   what you 've quoted is from the conditions under which the service provider is shielded from liability . 
  right . 
  in the us , they 're liable if they 're told something is infringing , fail to take it down , and it turns out to be infringing . 
  how this different from europe is that they are liable even if , in good faith , they did not believe it was infringing . 
  this means that they effectively have to take down anything user-generated while they investigate , however flimsy the claim seems , because of the consequences if it turns out to be correct . 
   in both settings , google has to `` expeditiously '' take down infringing content once they 've been made aware . 
  the us clearly defines how one tells google about violations , the eu does n't ( yet ) . 
  the dmca takedown process does not differ just in that there is a standardised process - any properly-formatted dmca takedown notice must be followed ( at least until the alleged infringer objects ) , even if there is no actual infringement :  upon notification of ** claimed ** infringement as described in paragraph ( 3 ) , responds expeditiously to remove , or disable access to , ** the material that is claimed to be infringing ** or to be the subject of infringing activity . 
  the provision of the dmca go beyond what 's required by wipo . 
  [ this is a pretty good summary of the situation in the eu ] ( https://www.quora.com/is-there-a-uk-equivalent-of-filing-a-dmca-cease-and-desist-for-websites-hosting-copied-content ) , although there have been several attempts to bring in dmca-style takedown notices as the `` eu notice and action initiative '' . 
  the bit you quoted is badly out of context . 
  [ here 's the relevant clause in its entirity ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:32000l0031 ) :  1 \\ . 
  where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service , member states shall ensure that the service provider is not liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service , on condition that :  ( a ) the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and , as regards claims for damages , is not aware of facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is apparent ; or  ( b ) the provider , upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness , acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information . 
  so `` such '' knowledge refers to `` actual '' knowledge . 
  this is crucially different from the way dmca takedowns function : in the us , hosts have to take down content just because somebody * has told them * it 's infringing . 
  other countries have copyright law . 
  they mostly do * not * have guilty-until-proven-innocent laws equivalent to the dmca . 
  oh , and i suppose google results are uncensored in the us ? 
  american companies routinely abuse the dmca to prevent their past mistakes from coming up on google search , and because google is a us company , this effects searches in any country . 
   why finland hates putin so much ?

   if you think that taiwan is part of china then there 's no use arguing with you . 
  well , it 's exactly the same as thinking crimea is in ukraine - it 's about the difference between the internationally recognised situation and the de-facto situation . 
   wtf bangladesh they seem to be second only to vietnam in loving everybody . 
  you can tell which of them are the actual diplomats . 
  they are working on a system for cars called ecall . 
  it will consist of a little box installed somewhere in the car that , in the event of a crash , automatically makes a cellular call to 112 and gives them the car 's location ( from galileo ) . 
  it 's supposed to make sure an ambulance gets there quickly even if the driver is unconscious . 
  apparently it 's going to be mandatory in new cars after 2018 . 
  as for satnav stuff , i expect we will see receivers that make use of at least gps , glonas and galileo at the same time , for better accuracy and reliability . 
  you ca n't use it * now * . 
  phones are treated as such a disposable item that it 's assumed that those sold today will have been replaced by the time galileo is ready .
