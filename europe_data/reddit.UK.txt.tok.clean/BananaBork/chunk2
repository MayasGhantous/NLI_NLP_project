  invading a european country who was on the cusp of becoming one of our own ? 
  shooting down 250 eu citizens ? 
  and what have we done about it ? 
  fucking hell we look weak . 
  unless brazil , mexico and argentina are overseas territories , then no :p, 
  strange , on my erasmus i met dozens of latin americans and they always told me they were doing an erasmus year . 
  not all industries have a union in sweden . 
  if things are n't improving , they are getting worse . 
  you should always be aiming to improve . 
  i do n't understand why you used that quote , seems out of place, 
  and look which party made huge ground in the recent elections . 
  by itself , no . 
  but surely you must understand that there must be some serious causes and grievances to make a population feel that way . 
  contrary to what continental europhiles believe , it has n't just appeared out of nowhere to spite them . 
   the uk is destined to be militarily and economically absorbed by europe in the same way that canada is militarily and economically destined to be absorbed by the united states . 
  really ? 
  the trend of countries being absorbed into larger countries seems to have reached its peak in 1900ish , and that failed terribly . 
  considering that today there are more independent countries than ever ( and it looks like it may be growing ) , it does n't seem reasonable to say that it is destiny . 
  you ca n't discount the opinion of the british public simply because europeans may not agree with it . 
  when it comes down to it , the british public will be the deciders on what happens when it comes to eu integration . 
  you make it sound like the eu is just one great big hippy star trek convention . 
  but the third highest economy leaving will damage the eu , and other eurosceptic countries will probably follow . 
  britain leaving would not be good for the eu at all . 
  you should have seen the number that blair and brown did on england . 
  you think they just decided that out of the blue ? 
  seriously ? 
  you think there is n't a deeper reason to that other than `` because they decided '' ? 
  tunnbr\u00f6d is fucking heavenly . 
  could eat that shit all day . 
  apple pie as well , one of the most honest , traditional english puddings but it is one of the symbols of america . 
  hahaha . 
  i live with native swedes and 1st generation iraqi immigrants and there is zero tension based on culture/race/religion . 
  anything else you are going to pull out of your arse ? 
  edit : talking as a foreigner to both countries , when i spent time in poland i actually found it to be very unwelcoming in comparison . 
  maybe you should look closer to home before trying to drag others down with you . 
  i wonder where wales would rank . 
  maybe there is a correlation . 
  brit living in sweden . 
  this country feels incredibly safe in every aspect . 
  the riots you are referring to were triggered by one death and left 7 people hurt . 
  you are delusional if you think this is enough to brand a country as unsafe . 
  compare with the kiev riots earlier this year which left 1300 injured , 7 dead , 21 missing and triggered a civil war . 
  i see what you are saying but i think that it is certainly one of the more legitimate biases . 
  i 'm not very socialist for most things , but i would suggest that equity is one of the most important aspects of national healthcare from my point of view . 
  maybe even one of the most important aspects of the modern nation state . 
  that said i am a brit living in sweden so i guess i am rather biased myself , given the results . 
  yeah i know , i was just being difficult :p, 
  i know a lot of welsh people who can barely speak a word of welsh . 
  i live in a fairly small town in sweden and i always have real difficulty with elderly people . 
  most simply ca n't / wo n't to speak english . 
  one of britain 's greatest cultural exports - a gay brown immigrant . 
  i wonder if he is popular amongst ukip members . 
  people brag about their holidays all the time !, 
  i must know dozens of people who have told me of spain , france and america . 
  yet i ca n't recall a single time someone told me that they are going for a skiing holiday in norway or a weekend in stockholm . 
  obviously after , but that does n't change the point of what i am saying . 
  basically everyone i meet in sweden says `` oh , i 've been to england '' . 
  needless to say i do n't think i have ever met anyone in the uk who has been to scandinavia . 
   average winter temperatures in southern scandinavia are higher than continental winter temperatures , courtesy of the gulf stream . 
  summers do n't get as warm , obviously , but remain pleasant , though unpredictable . 
  you literally just tried to claim you have good weather by describing it as british weather . 
  that said it has been a glorious few days in sweden . 
  that sounds awesome , where can i watch the doc ? 
   the romans bothered to develop their whole empire , and gave citizenship to the elite of every part of it . 
  i thought that everyone in the empire was considered a british subject . 
  it is part of the reason that british citizenship law is so complicated today . 
  sadly it usually is n't good when derry appears in the national news . 
  strange , i remember reading somewhere that sweden gets a very high percentage of their gas from russia . 
  which have if anything been strengthening ties with the west . 
  logic , bitch !, 
  i do n't think distance travelled is a very accurate way to compare anyway . 
  i think time travelling would be better . 
   edit : welp , looks like you ninja-edited that bit out before i replied . 
  yeah sorry , i rephrased my sentence because i did n't think you would read it that fast !, 
  it was n't to make you look stupid , sorry, 
  lol you said it yourself mate . 
  cyclists hitting a pedestrian is less likely to happen . 
  so that makes it safer . 
  let us look at the statistics a little bit . 
  [ `` just 2 per cent of pedestrian injuries on pavements involve cyclists ... one pedestrian was killed by a cyclist and 78 were seriously injured in 2012 . 
  '' ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/cyclesafety/article3986796.ece ) cyclist casualties , 2012 - 118 killed - 3,222 seriously injured common cycling accidents : * ** motorist ** emerging into path of cyclist * ** motorist ** turning across path of cyclist * cyclist riding into the path of a ** motor vehicle ** , often riding off a pavement * cyclist and ** motorist ** going straight ahead * cyclist turning right from a major ** road ** and from a minor road * child cyclist playing or riding too fast ( but only 13 were children , so adult deaths are almost exclusively road-based ) [ source ] ( http://www.rospa.com/roadsafety/adviceandinformation/cycling/facts-figures.aspx ), 
  what do you think would do more damage ? 
  pedestrian hit by a bicycle , or a cyclist hit by a car ? 
  be serious now . 
  but much safer in most cases and the only people who care are pcsos . 
  makes me feel proud . 
  we should march in the troops at dawn . 
  its to defend against the swedes obviously . 
  damn swedes . 
  somehow i imagine the west would be much more active in defending a country like sweden , despite being non nato . 
  i always thought it was spelt taters . 
  so where is the news of polish embargo ? 
  did i miss an article or are you just being an arse ? 
  yes , you are right . 
  but i think things like this will be decided in the grace period after a successful referendum . 
  scotland will remain in cta and out of schengen . 
  i live in sweden and i completely lack the ability to speak swedish . 
  you can hardly blame me when swedes most often begin a conversation with me in english !, 
  why do you think that ? 
  there is no bitterness between the ww1-era belligerents any more ( or even ww2 ) , why should it be different for the irish ?
