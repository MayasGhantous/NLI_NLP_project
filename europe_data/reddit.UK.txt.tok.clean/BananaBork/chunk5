  the same could be said even of my hometown . 
  well , my question did include the clause `` if you do at all '' . 
  german never sounded so beautiful . 
  what happened in ' 68 ? 
  according the languages tab down the side of [ wikipedia - pickled cucumber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pickled_cucumber ) , most languages use a variation of `` salt gherkin '' or `` pickled gherkin '' . 
  though as you might expect , plenty of european cultures have varying traditions around what they pickle and how the result tastes - so it is n't always a perfect translation and there may be more popular phrases . 
  you are right , we would n't dream of it . 
  yeah me too . 
  apparently the army is easier for irishmen to join . 
  odd , i would have guessed that bryan was a more irish way of spelling it . 
   if i were you i 'd join the raf i just looked it up , and that 's actually pretty hard . 
  [ raf eligibility check ] ( https://www.raf.mod.uk/recruitment/how-to-apply/eligibility-check/ ) irish republic nationals must have lived for 5 years in the uk , with less than 28 days per year outside the uk , else they require additional eligibility checks . 
  no idea what they entail though . 
  looks like a good match for the [ '50s russian bombers ] ( http://files.stv.tv/imagebase/30/623x349/30785-bear-bomber-raf-typhoon-with-one-of-the-russian-tu-95s.jpg ) that have been flying around our isles . 
  i 'm not a ` low class alcholic ' but i would totally love free beer for voting . 
  we should embrace the change . 
  it 's obviously the better name . 
  else perhaps we should call france the french republic too . 
  it 's `` majk gouv '' , otherwise known as [ michael gove ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_gove ) . 
  everyone 's favourite !, 
  it 's weird how they 've labelled both scotch and scots as two separate entities . 
  `` an usual '' is uncommon because the `` u '' is pronounced as a consonant as in `` you '' . 
  so it should be `` a usual '' . 
  also chiming in to say i have no idea who he is . 
  i follow eu politics a bit but he 's hardly a household name . 
  no , your point is invalidated by the fact that none of the ` imperialistic ' nations of the world are doing any better than the nations that have had nothing to do with - or indeed suffered from - the age of imperialistic supremacy . 
  britain and spain are at the bottom of the list . 
  france does n't even make the list . 
  do you genuinely think ireland and finland prospered * more * from old imperialism than these three empires ? 
  from these facts , it is clear that 1700s colonialism has had very little impact on the safety of today 's modern europeans . 
  wealth and safety is evidently created in the ` here and now ' by progressive governments , it is not some destiny written 300 years ago . 
  ah yes , the infamous colonial empires of hong kong , iceland , finland and ireland . 
  i guess it 's calculated by dozens of factors , and not just homicide . 
   `` craftsbeer marxists '' hah i 've never heard that term before but i love it . 
  in the uk we call them `` champagne socialists '' . 
  a huge part of nato 's strength ( and indeed its primary aim ) is mutual defence - the day it does n't help an invaded member is the day its entire mission fails . 
  the baltics would likely be overrun initially , but russia knows it is not capable of a direct and sustained great war against the entirety of nato and friends . 
  you are mistaken . 
  `` these are the hijacker and i '' is not correct at all :\\, 
  `` these are the hijacker and i ? '', 
  really ? 
  `` this is the hijacker and me '' sounds far , far more likely . 
  natural selection is less about death and more about procreation . 
  this guy leaves this situation alive and with a bit more sex appeal than he had going in , so surely he is a * winner * by the rules of natural selection ? 
   long trips in big groups are dangerous literally millions of people go on ski trips and festivals and `` that nonsense '' every year without dying . 
  being driven by professional drivers in slow vehicles is a very safe way to travel , it 's just that when it goes wrong it 's very newsworthy because it affects a number of people . 
  cars are far more dangerous , but you rarely hear about them killing people because it 's so frequent . 
  well yeah , there were a lot of people who benefited from civilisation . 
  in fact , many benefits would have reached every single person in a country . 
  but you should n't downplay the killing , famine and misery that comes from conquering and occupying a people who are perceived as being ` lesser ' . 
  no we do n't . 
  you can fly , drive and ship between the uk to ireland without a passport . 
  probably similar to that . 
  yeah i do n't doubt that . 
  but the mapmaker was pretty specific in what it the map shows . 
  yeah switzerland formally maintaining the status quo really is the last nail in the coffin / s, 
  that 's not really what this map is showing though . 
  i do not hate the queen and respect her for what she has done , even though i am not royalist . 
  there are many symbols of my national identity that i celebrate , but gstw ( as a national symbol and a song ) is just awful . 
  it is not a symbol of british unity to me , rather it feels a symbol of english supremacy ( even though i am part english , i have very strong ties to wales and scotland so this aspect bothers me ) . 
  sing it in scotland or northern ireland , and it will not be received warmly . 
  i would describe myself as unionist and fond of britain , but i reject your insistence that i should blindly adore every single aspect of this country 's symbolism . 
  you are right . 
  i detest our anthem and never sing it . 
  not only because it 's a cringeworthy drone , but i do n't feel that the lyrics represent me or my country very well at all . 
  earliest reference that i can find to anything resembling gaelic football is 1500s . 
  well , ireland was ruled by queen victoria for her entire reign . 
  1800s ireland was * literally * victorian . 
  i did n't say anything about it being english . 
  the football family of games have been played all over europe since medieval times , long before they were codified as soccer , gaelic and rugby . 
  modern gaelic football was certainly influenced by victorian rugby though . 
  it 's closer to rugby , but all three sports evolved from similar ~ ~ victorian ~ ~ * medieval * games . 
  it 's more about two differing views on sovereignty and national identity . 
  it just happens that both sides have ` opposing ' religions . 
  yeah do n't worry i got that . 
  sorry that my reply was a little argumentative , it was n't aimed at you . 
  a quick search and there are only 5,000 permanent british residents in hungary and probably fewer americans ( it is unreasonable to demand that tourists learn hungarian ) . 
  even assuming every single one of these english speakers refuses to learn hungarian , it 's ludicrous to blame 0.1 % of the population if the hungarian language really is diminishing . 
  this map is great but it does n't clear up the current discussion , which is about where welsh is spoken * instead * of english , rather than simply * alongside * it . 
  how is it the fault of native english speakers ? 
  even if every english speaker in the world picked a new language to learn today , it would not have even the smallest positive effect on the hungarian language . 
  somehow i doubt andorra would read well as `` archetypal western power '' . 
   second/third-gen immigrant youth with a bad education a significant number of european extremists are actually university-educated and from middle-class families . 
  though i agree with most of the other reasons you give . 
  in english , [ lowlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_lowlands ) usually refers to southern scotland ( e.g. 
  not the [ highlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_highlands ) ) . 
  for benelux , we usually say the [ low countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_countries ) . 
  that definitely sounds left to me . 
  how was rugby invented in france ? 
  it 's even named after the english city in which it was founded ... 
  coloured symbols are just infinitely better from a usability point of view though . 
  i actually do n't mind that . 
  it seems like more of a cute joke than anything else . 
  or `` english '' and `` english ( united kingdom ) '' . 
  sounds more like it, 
  it 's probably quite hard to clear the sas for action against our own `` allies '' . 
  that 's not what that phrase means . 
  transporting wine is hardly `` living by the sword '' . 
  the third guy might be the cameraman ? 
   germans well , certainly germanic people in a broader sense ; the anglo-saxons had as much to do with modern denmark and the netherlands as germany proper .
