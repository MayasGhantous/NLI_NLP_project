vote leave so that we do n't have to be a part of this horror . 
  i hate to indulge in whataboutery , but how much does the communist group in the european parliament get ? 
  patronising rubbish . 
  they try and argue from a position of authority , but they are as biased and wrong as any journalist . 
  peter hitchens called them out on it spectacularly in their own comments section . 
  worse . 
  i think it says that teachers ( and the police and the government ) do n't give a shit about working class white people . 
  and half the weight . 
  nothing . 
  decades of brainwashing and propaganda means that every islamic extremist is as british as the next man . 
  europe needs president trump as much as , if not more , than the usa does . 
  would this be before or after they go to syria then come back and gun down dozens of people at a rock concert, 
  selling british citizens down the river to a hostile foreign power = treachery, 
  would poland be more safe or less safe if 10 % of its population were immigrants and descended from immigrants ? 
  they just ca n't help destroying europe an ( in ) accurate series of events instigated by germans : - destroyed the western roman empire - started the 30 years war - invented marxism - responsible for the first world war - began the frankfurt school , resulting in cultural marxism , which has destroyed the west - started the second world war - responsible for recently flooding europe with what will end up being millions upon millions of migrants, 
  how can they put the entire kosovo government on trial ? 
  the women get left behind in syria , iraq , eritrea , kosovo , afghanistan , pakistan and the refugee camps . 
  even if he did , he has no chance as we still have a military , unlike most of europe . 
  at least putin has no desire to control our country . 
  your syrian pets murdered a russian pilot . 
  the angle is `` see ? 
  we are all immigrants so we should open the borders and turn britain into an indistinct mix of people from everywhere and nowhere because diversity '', 
  while i agree with you , the zulu king is just arsepained that the ifp has lost all power and relevance . 
  do you seriously think they 're going to go back at some point ? 
  file this under `` fiction '' . 
   it 's just not a culturally british thing to do . 
  it does n't . 
  the saying is `` toe the line '' , meaning `` obey the rules '' . 
  one does n't `` tow lines '' . 
  something could perhaps be towed using a line , but that still does n't match up with what you said . 
   you 're a crazy isolationist who tows that line all the way into retardation . 
  as someone so keen to criticise others ' english , you should be aware that this does n't make sense . 
  what good did the british-polish alliance do ? 
  what 's best for europe is obviously not what 's best for britain . 
  allying with belgium and poland dragged britain into european wars which destroyed the continent with no benefit to anyone . 
  estonia and poland would not ( and could not ) help us liberate the falklands . 
  i do n't see why we should give a shit about estonia and poland . 
  starting turkey 's eu accession talks was a mistake . 
  give the drone controller a medal . 
  ukraine is * so * european and progressive . 
  getting rid of roaming charges means that bills will go up for the 95 % of people who did n't use roaming . 
  i 'm sure you can point to all the reddit bots made for the pet causes of arsepained british people . 
  every attempt to make a single market for services gets stopped by germany . 
  it will never happen . 
  it really shows the arsepain suffered by irish people . 
  there is no eu market for services . 
  something like 75 % of economic activity comes from services , but less than 25 % of that takes place between different eu countries . 
  so be it . 
  are we supposed to care about ireland when most irish people would happily see us fall into the sea ? 
  the portuguese national anthem was written with a line urging the population to be anti-british . 
  the treaty of windsor is just a piece of paper . 
  i think you 're deluded . 
  european countries have been diametrically opposed to the uk 's interests since year dot . 
  our government got ignored by the eu and the other european countries every step of the way unless they started actually being obstinate like margaret thatcher did in the 1980s . 
  tony blair tried to be a constructive player in europe and all he managed was to make our own situation worse via the actions of the eu . 
  the two options are either being totally ignored while the eu takes our money and passes unfavourable laws or , when we try to participate , betrayal . 
  do you really think that european countries have ever been gb 's `` friends '' ? 
  they get things wrong , though . 
  peter hitchens called them out on it in their own comments section . 
  obviously . 
  people here knew what would happen to it and wisely decided to stay out . 
  the euro for one , blatantly obvious , thing . 
  the difference is that the pound will still exist in ten years ' time . 
  if the last twenty years prove anything , it 's that the eu actually should have listened to us . 
  when did the ira ever threaten to bomb schools ? 
  not twelve hours ago . 
   [ there is no eu army and most certainly wo n't be in the near future ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zrcly/theresa_may_will_trigger_brexit_negotiations/d6yjnr3?st=isdaedqo&amp;sh=bce5d7ce ) - / u/ro4ers  [ eu army is n't happening ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zrcly/theresa_may_will_trigger_brexit_negotiations/d6yktpp?st=isdaf6rn&amp;sh=fbce6737 ) - / u/yebi, 
  muslim stabs jew shouting `` god is great '' . 
  i wonder what the motive was . 
  it 's not like poland would have the desire ( or the capacity ) to help us if it came down to it , either . 
  motive unclear , i 'm sure . 
  it 's the families who are instilling , enabling and tolerating the attitudes of the criminals and terrorists . 
  ask thousands of little girls all over england . 
  finally , someone speaking out for the real victims here . 
  believe that and you 'll believe anything . 
  `` welcome * to * paris '' , idiot . 
  the most powerful woman is the weakest german chancellor for decades . 
  converting to islam is a sign of mental illness , in my opinion . 
  the uk is not going to just give up gibraltar . 
  that much has been clear for centuries . 
  other than by force , how will the spanish foreign minister plant the spanish flag there ? 
  if spain and the eu think we are some piss-weak country they can push around , then this affair has proved them wrong . 
  the eu : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/02/eu-will-not-go-soft-on-gibraltar-brexit-talks-diplomats-say-spain spain : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/06/spains-foreign-minister-vows-to-plant-his-flag-on-gibraltar/, 
  did you think we 'd just roll over and let spain and brussels take our territory when our citizens do n't want that to happen ? 
  i agree with what michael howard said . 
  the eu and spain thought they 'd score a hit on us by questioning the status of gibraltar as part of the brexit negotiations . 
  the government , through lord howard , has shown how we will deal with threats to our citizens . 
  he was a good boy getting his life back on track . 
  i 'm sure he is a good boy who did n't do anything . 
  nick '' [ dangerous fantasy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmyvydkl6uk ) '' clegg, 
  spain has one of the most anti-british populations in europe , though .

  richard murphy has been wrong about nearly everything . 
  they all will , eventually . 
  the fact that these joke countries like luxembourg and ireland have a hand in governing the rest of europe , where the state actually has to collect tax , should have any reasonable person tearing his or her hair out . 
  good luck assad, 
  i like how you jump to `` refugees '' illegally crossing borders . 
  look up how many people move to europe legally every year . 
  `` democracy '' is meaningless . 
  governments routinely ignore the wishes of the citizenry .
