  no , that is n't it at all . 
  french is spoken by ** 28 % ** of people in europe . 
  it 's the 3rd most spoken language . 
  english is spoken to at least an adequate level by ** 47 % ** of europe . 
  that is why everyone here speaks english . 
  ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ found ^ ^ a ^ ^ better ^ ^ source , ^ ^ adjusted ^ ^ percentages, 
  i 'm not saying it 's a bad thing , i 'm saying that it 's unfair to say `` you just do n't want them in the midlands or other places that are ` white ' '' . 
  because it does n't make sense . 
  you think the midlands are white ? 
  17.4 % of people in the west midlands are not white ... space and housing is a huge issue in the uk at the moment . 
  i 'm saying the big gangs in the uk are almost exclusively pakistani . 
  the average cost of 1l petrol in the us this year was about $ 0.79 , in the uk it 's about $ 1.84 i think we 're allowed to say they have cheap petrol, 
  it 's an average . 
  go down to london and you can easily pay more than twice what you pay . 
  total amount i have to spend after rent , car insurance & phone bill ( biggest costs ) monthly is # 140 . 
  that 's for food , petrol , laundry , clothing if i need it . 
  i 'd like to save some money up but i ca n't really afford to , at all . 
  got a new job lined up soon though so if i get it i should have quite a lot more . 
  here 's hoping . 
  actually in the uk we pay a much higher percentage of our income on rent . 
  our rent is 300 euro higher than germany 's on average & we have similar income levels http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/24/uk-tenants-pay-more-rent-than-europe?cmp=twt_gu, 
  lol , it does n't even work in the us . 
  they 'd have about 120 mass shootings so far * this year alone * . 
  that 's not really what proportionate means in that sense , like you do n't have to wait to be hit to hit them . 
  if you feel like they 're going to kill you , you can do whatever it takes to stop them from killing you . 
  that 's how it is in the uk anyway . 
  there 's so much black market booze and cigarettes in the uk , absolutely . 
  that 'll be such a huge problem . 
  when people could get it cheaper , legally , safer , they will absolutely be going to shady black market dealers instead . 
  and they 're not ` draining ' the people 's pockets , it 's just taxation you idiot . 
  there 's nothing wrong with taxes . 
  prices do not grow when legalising it . 
  the prices you pay right now come from the illegality of growing it , smuggling it , selling it etc. 
  if it 's legalised then growers/suppliers can do it legally so the price will drop dramatically . 
  which is exactly what happened in america . 
  yeah , there 'll be new taxes on it ... but the price will still be cheaper . 
  yeah i know , i meant before i came to the thread . 
  do n't even know what a name day is . 
  yes they are . 
  they are very different . 
  no , but it * is * like nobody knows that men make up a massive percentage of rape/dom violence victims . 
  also the fact that it 's the first centre for men with plenty for women , that in itself is big, 
  you 're an idiot . 
  they are n't people , but they are n't treated like property either . 
  a huge amount of conservation work ( helping endangered species ) and research is carried out because of zoos , and many species would be extinct today if not for them . 
  regardless of what you think , zoos help animals . 
  zoos do a huge amount of good , maybe [ you ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2014/aug/19/why-zoos-are-good ) [ should ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-zoos-help-endangered-animals/ ) [ do ] ( http://endangeredspecies.about.com/od/zoosandcaptivebreeding/ss/top-5-endangered-species-breeding-programs.htm ) [ some ] ( http://www.whyzoos.com/protect.html ) reading yourself ? 
  you think that because you 're seeing the really obvious tourists though - i 'd bet you that you 've seen loads of tourists and have n't realised but it is the obvious ones that get mugged, 
  you were n't a tourist . 
  we do have a lot of the roma in the uk as well , it 's not just the irish travellers . 
  pretty disgusted that so many people in here are defending child abuse to be honest . 
  ukip 's had a lot of problems after the election , i honestly doubt they 'll be a factor by the next election ( especially since we 'll have voted to stay in europe by then ) . 
  yes but most of our country did n't vote for that twat . 
  hate cameron , do n't hate the country . 
  also uk people 's support for staying in the eu has been rising for years , we * want * to stay in the eu as-is . 
  i disagree , i went to a place in manchester just the other day where i had the best steak i ever had + beer for # 12 , it 's not hard at all to find a good cheap place to eat . 
  i went to portugal ( from the uk ) when i was 5 years old . 
  on the first day , a few hours after getting off the flight , my brother slipped and broke his arm . 
  i get the feeling that you 're not lying . 
  why the usa flair ? 
  it 's actually so that the crew will have safe water to drink and for rations , but it 's used for tea, 
  we 're very likely to vote to stay . 
  saying things like this does n't help , though . 
  just as a story about this : my dad is a paramedic . 
  one day , about 10 years ago , they get a call about a man who was out jogging who collapsed ( heart attack ) . 
  so my dad gets there and starts treating him in the back of the ambulance on the way back to the hospital - on the drive there , the guy 's heart stopped dead 6 times but every time my dad managed to restart it . 
  that guy 's still alive , and used to ( not for a few years now ) send my dad a thank-you card in the post . 
  he was in a magazine for it actually, 
  yes , exactly the same way . 
  seriously i think it 's terrible that there 's such a brain drain from those eastern countries and something should be done about it . 
  i do n't know what , though . 
  stop making assumptions about me . 
   being pro-eu means you do n't care where your money ends up inside the eu , because , you know , we 're all europeans ? 
  for the moment , it 's taking money from one country 's economy and putting into another 's . 
  i would n't mind that , but it 's taxpayer money that 's going into another country 's economy . 
  if we ever become federalised then i obviously would n't care . 
  good luck guys . 
  austerity 's worked * so * well everywhere else . 
  point is it 's removing money from our economy . 
  normally you 'd get child benefits and spend them in this country , but getting them and sending them out hurts us . 
  i do n't give two shits where it 's going , eastern or western europe . 
  i am incredibly pro-eu but that 's one issue even most of us would agree on . 
  our banks very much want to stay in the eu ... we 're the financial centre of the eu and one of the top ones in the world , leaving would be absolutely disasterous for us, 
  ah okay , did n't know . 
  cheers !, 
  ni is devolved , it 's up to them to pass it themselves . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scat_singing the singing style is scat mate , it 's used in a lot of ska songs though . 
  the rest of the song was n't ska, 
  in the uk , civil unions between homosexual couples were exactly the same as marriage in all but name . 
  they had all the rights of a married couple , and have for many years . 
  we 've just allowed them to actually be married now . 
  uk was alright this year . 
  something nice and unique . 
  even had some scat in there , too . 
  impressed . 
  a ridiculously huge number of aussies watch eurovision , i guess they just finally let them in because of it . 
  bit strange but with how many of them love it i 'm not surprised, 
  was n't there some stuff about hola using your connection as an exit node for other people using hola ? 
  meaning people could be using your internet for illegal stuff if you 're not okay with that , absolutely do not use/install hola, 
  his flag is the flag of georgia pal , lol .
