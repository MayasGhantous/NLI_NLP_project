then scotland can say hello to border controls with the rest of the uk . 
  well it 's the official figure from the uk government . 
  if they were to skew the numbers , it 'd be to lower it , not raise it ( given the govt is for staying , and leavers use the contributions as a reason to leave ) , i think . 
  well , it 's # 8.5 bn in 2015 . 
  i imagine the bloke is also including the # 1.7 bn we paid last year on top of our membership contributions , to take the figure to # 10.2 bn .

  the wars were expensive , but nowhere near expensive enough to land the uk in the amount of debt we have now . 
  official statistics state that both iraq and afghanistan had a combined cost of # 20.3 billion ( up to but not past june 2010 , iraq 's fund came out of the special reserve of government funding ) , whereas the uk national debt is now around # 1.6 trillion ( 1.35 % of national debt ) . 
  the uk pays almost as much on the interest to the national debt as we do on defence per year . 
  the uk 's defence spending as a percentage of gdp is now technically below 2 % ( whereas in the 90 's we were at around 4-5 % , it is only budget trickery that keeps it at 2 % ( as per government policy ) ) . 
  the lack of funding shows . 
  the royal navy now has an effective surface fleet of 17 , with a type 45 being eeduced to a training ship ( the most expensive on earth , how great the mod is !, 
  ) , and a severe lack of manpower , causing deployments to last ( in the navy ) up to 11-12 months , with a standard of 9 . 
  the wars were expensive on a modern uk standard , but that is all . 
  thought you should know that nikki sinclaire has n't been an mep for 2 years . 
  in the uk we had pleb-gate , also known as gate-gate as it occurred because of a gate . 
  british eurosceptic checking in . 
  i love this sub , love the diversity . 
  i disagree . 
  polls are showing a fluctuation between remain and leave . 
  yeah just like americans who do n't want a union with mexico want to kill all of the mexicans !, 
  idiot . 
  according to fullfact , 78.5 % of full-time nhs workers are british , meaning that at the very most , 21.5 % of full-time employees are foreign-born . 
  and there are absolutely no statistics on the colour of the employee 's skin ( seriously ? ) . 
  [ source - fullfact ] ( https://fullfact.org/health/immigration-and-nhs-how-many-staff-are-eu-and-commonwealth/ ) . 
  although the guardian claim that only 11 % of nhs staff are non-british . 
  the figure for just * doctors * is higher , though .

  i 'm not too sure , but i 'd imagine it 's because the bank of england produces the notes for the england , and there are probably far more bank of england notes than bank of scotland notes . 
  also , it 's to be expected that you would hold currency from other countries since the netherlands does not have a central bank , since the monetary policy is largely determined by the european central bank in frankfurt , and i suppose they mint the currency , which is then transported all over the eurozone . 
  again ; speculation . 
  i 've really no idea . 
  i probably take a couple of scottish/n . 
  irish notes per month at the most . 
  northern irish # 5 notes look really distinct . 
  quite cool . 
  well i work in a tesco store in leicestershire , we * very rarely * get other banknotes , but we all know they 're accepted legally . 
  there 's no middle ground here , it must just be general ignorance ; but they are accepted . 
  the only issues with scottish notes is accepting # 1 notes , because the bank of england does n't print those for england . 
  but # 5 , # 10 and # 20 is routinely accepted when we get customers use them . 
  i can tell you that scottish notes certainly are accepted in england , at least where i work . 
  same goes for irish notes . 
  not true at all . 
  you ca n't ` cyber ' your way out of a hellfire missile . 
  in war you use all means at your disposal . 
  the uk 's always been half-in , half-out . 
  so what would your logic be behind that , then ? 
  er what ? 
  except the only nations with credible armed forces in europe is the uk and france , and the uk will never be a part of a european military . 
  rather just fight the luftwaffe and the kriegsmarine than the wehrmacht too . 
   if the text is misunderstood , the error is with the writer i respectfully disagree . 
  the rules of the language are clear . 
  but fair enough . 
   simply because it is written afterwards  this holiday was nice ^ ^ ^ ( 1 ) , and yet i liked our other holiday more ^ ^ ^ 2 . 
    tell me which came first , statement 1 or 2 ? 
  point stands , other than the flimsy idea that only order of statements can indicate which came first , nothing in my original post overtly states which came first , which is irrelevant anyway . 
  that may be so , but the intention is clear if you read the words and understand the current and past tenses . 
   it is my 30th birthday today , and yet i liked my 20th birthday better this does not indicate the 20th birthday came afterwards simply because it is written afterwards . 
  simple understanding of the language and a gram of common sense will tell you which came first . 
  pointless downvoting is plain stupid by the way . 
  did i make it seem that way ? 
  i literally just stated the facts , timestamps are clear to be seen . 
  there is nothing in my post which indicates that the uk threatened to block an eu army after the commission started an inquiry . 
  if anything , you are incorrect . 
  my post states  it 's bizarre how most here ( see comment chain ) ** are stating **   current tense and then following on to the bit about the ` army ' proposal  and ** yet when the uk threatened ** to block the ` eu army ' proposal   past tense there is nothing there that overtly states a timescale , and even looking at the grammar , you can not come to the conclusion that the words used indicate that the threat came after the inquiry . 
  that just does n't make sense . 
  clearly the ` eu army ' thing came first given the tenses used in my post . 
  english language rules mean nothing so just downvote . 
  cheers bud . 
  if you want , you can actually read their '83 manifesto [ here ] ( http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab83.htm ) , there is some stuff in there that seems very relevant today , to be honest . 
  i was n't around in the 80s though and so have no idea about how it was received . 
  i noticed they wanted to introduce the foi act , which ended up only being introduced in 2000 by tony blair 's first government . 
  well 50.01 / 100 is a majority . 
  may be measly , but it fits the definition entirely . 
  won three elections and was pm for 11 years ? 
  shocking that if your opposition is incompetent then you have an easy time . 
  it 's bizarre how most here ( [ see comment chain ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5bbhle/commission_inquires_about_uks_offer_to_nissan/d9n7p8f ) ) are stating that since the uk is still in the eu , it must still follow the rules ; and yet when the uk [ threatened to block the ` eu army ' proposal ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54pj42/uk_defence_minister_we_are_going_to_continue_to ) ( something the uk government would be entirely entitled to do , as it is still a full member ) , everyone freaked out , given we ` were on the way out ' . 
  which is it ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  should the uk be able to act as a full member or not ? 
  i know the uk was supposedly to use france 's ( until ours was built ) , but then we went with the f-35b . 
  well there 's bae 's taranis , and dassault 's neuron . 
  it spawned the idea of a joint uk-french air system , currently ( i believe ) called [ future combat air system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_offensive_air_system ) . 
  according to the wikipedia page , it is likely that bae 's taranis will be selected . 
  well , it was actually that aircraft from france and the uk could operate from each others carriers , rather than actually share the carrier itself ( air wing and ship company being different entities ) . 
  that plan is still in place though is now more or less dead . 
  france does not have jump jets , the uk will operate two carriers , and soon enough france will operate none ( as they canceled their replacement for the cdg ) . 
  basically , military planning of either country diverged . 
  that 's the most american thing i 've read for a while . 
  ... we do n't have bears here . 
  the most vicious thing we have is badgers . 
  yeah you are right , a couple of years ago the uk was in the first place , but since then the foreign office has removed a few countries from visa-free travel , i believe . 
  is there a study that shows that ? 
  seems awfully odd that you can claim it is 0.7 % every single year . 
  i think it 's likely that she 's just allowing her new departments to form a negotiation strategy . 
  it really is not likely that she can wait any longer than march now to trigger article 50 . 
  [ we have been over this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55d7nt/british_pm_theresa_may_says_scotland_will_have_no/d89llzx?context=3 ) . 
  what is there not there to subscribe to ? 
  england did not annex scotland or anything . 
  scotland has more devolution than any region of england .
