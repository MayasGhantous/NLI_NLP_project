   the reality of the need for more ** death ships ** well i 'm sure this conversation will go just fine . 
  i 'm sure tens of thousands of people in the philippines , many islands in the caribbean , sierra leone , vanuatu and thousands of refugees pulled out of the mediterranean disagree with your sentiment . 
  china , russia , us , uk , france and india are all now considered blue-water navies . 
  able to operate independently . 
  all of the countries in that list have more naval striking power than the uk ( all have aircraft carriers ) . 
  research will help your points , if you cared to do it . 
  well ** any ** potential adversary would have no choice but to fight us on the seas , we 're an island . 
  predicting who we will fight in the distant future is an idiot 's game , it is up to government to assure that we are able to see off any eventual threat , no matter who it comes from . 
  david cameron 's mismanagement of the royal navy in particular was dreadful . 
  cut the surface fleet by 5 frigates and destroyers to 19 ( meaning that we can now only guarantee 6 on deployment at a time -- how many to escort the qe-class ? 
  ) , decommissioned our 2 aircraft carriers , got rid of the harriers , scrapped 3 auxiliary vessels , scrapped the nimrod programme and cutting 5,000 personnel and starting a chronic manpower shortage . 
  it 's truly been one of the worst periods for the rn in the last 30 or 40 years , the degradation of capability in such a short time has been staggering . 
  only in the last year have things been looking up , with the announcement of an extra type 31 , the p-8 's and the carriers . 
  to think in 1982 we were able to deploy around 70 royal navy and rfa vessels to a conflict on the other side of the globe is astonishing and highlights what just 5 governments can do in damage . 
  i mean judging by their wikipedia page , they were only a party for 19 years and only ever won 2 elections before it was reformed as the republican party . 
  the whig party ( presuming you 're talking about the uk ) became the liberal party , and in the year that they changed their name , they also won 356 seats still as the whigs . 
  not sure what you 're getting at . 
   a billion time more useful . 
  carriers have been outdated for half a century . 
  they 're pure prestige , and zero utility . 
  they 're the gold dagger that you throw into a sniper fight . 
  useless . 
  pretty . 
  remind me when the last aircraft carrier was lost in combat , and also how many times since that time an aircraft carrier has been used in active combat operations ? 
  the answer : june 27 , 1945 was the date of the last aircraft carrier sunk , and basically every single year since an aircraft carrier has been used in some way in active operations . 
  seems with escorts , aircraft carriers are n't obsolete !, 
  so will the qe ? 
  the cdg is actually in refit for 18 months , so france is currently also without an aircraft carrier . 
  i get what you 're saying but i disagree . 
  the uk is completely polarised on the state and direction of the country and very much apathetic to politics . 
   mainly of a certain age claiming that they only joined a free trade block . 
  the above posts and article are talking about the uk joining the eec , which no longer exists , and was the precursor to the eu ( formed in 1957 and ended in 1993 ) . 
  the people who voted on membership of the eec are now the elderly . 
  people are free to hijack their arguments for their own gain by saying `` we never knew it was political '' , there 's very little you can do about that . 
  but the overriding arguments i 've heard against the eec from those who voted at the time was that it was positioned as a trading bloc , not a political bloc . 
  frankly i 've no idea if that 's true or not , i 've never looked at the coverage or anything . 
   ** mainly of a certain age ** claiming that they only joined a free trade block well obviously they 're going to be older , given that there was only ever one vote on the matter of joining the european economic community and that was in 1975 , meaning anyone of voting age at the time will be at least 60 years old now . 
  the constant news coverage and public bickering ? 
  not to mention a heightened polarised populace . 
   keeping trident alive as if it is n't subsidized and controlled by the us uk has total operational command of its nuclear forces . 
   those carriers who do n't even have planes able to fly on them yet you mean the 10 f-35bs we already have , with 24 by 2020 ? 
  the first carrier wo n't even be in active service for another year and a half at least . 
  well it 's more the endless campaigning that makes voter fatigue a thing ... 
  bring back mercia . 
  what ? 
  there are no eez clashes , that 's the point of an eez , a clearly set out territory . 
  sacking someone as influential as boris after such a torrid election would have ended her . 
  she 's made her situation so much worse , instead of making it so the hard right of the cons do n't hold the whip hand , they now have her in their pockets . 
  we still get all of the campaigning and rhetoric except for the actual voting in that case , it 's arguably worse . 
  sinn fein refuse to state their oath to the monarch and since they are a republican and irish nationalist party they refuse to actually sit in the commons , so this means that the total number of tangible seats is lower than 650 ( also , one seat is the speaker who must remain impartial and thus can not vote ) . 
  looks like it was a typo for `` take '' rather than tape '' . 
  uk media outlets are very party political , although the nhs will never state an opinion . 
  what you saw was likely just a campaign group in support of the nhs , not the nhs itself . 
  yeah they 're accurate , the seat count is not always right but the general trend almost always is . 
  i 'd say it 's worth it to stay up to see it . 
  semi democratic meaning what exactly ? 
  each seat is winner takes all , there are 650 seats with each mp representing a constituency of roughly 70,000 people , a majority of 650 ( 326 ) needed to ` win ' . 
  it 's not proportional and was not designed to be , it was designed to keep a solid foundation for government and offer constituencies a local mp to contact . 
  indeed , it certainly does n't help the uk 's apathy problem . 
  exit poll at 22:00 bst , full results wo n't be known until tomorrow , but constituencies should start declaring around midnight . 
  was relatively busy at my station at 8:30 ish , no young people in sight however . 
  although 8:30 ... 
  that 's easy , you just use $ 2 $ , that way nobody is happy . 
  interestingly though , the conservatives have n't really dropped in the polls too much ( a couple of percentage points ) , just that others are voting labour ( greens and snp specifically are shedding voters according to the polls , along with some ukip and lib dem voters ) . 
  he 's mocking those in the uk who say the uk 's foreign policy is why we get attacked . 
  no it refers to freest access that they can negotiate . 
  i 'm pretty sure the government 's policy is to secure the `` freest possible trading arrangement '' with the eu . 
  nobody with any intelligence said anything about it being exactly the same since we 're leaving the single market and customs union . 
  just bluff it !, 
  [ unsure if this is what we 're looking for ] ( http://maps.who.int/airpollution ) , but it does n't appear that bad . 
  other sources have it at less than 2x as bad as sweden ( which is like the 3rd best country on earth for air quality ) . 
  for those wondering this would n't normally be noteworthy , but the mod stated that the russian aircraft actually entered uk airspace , something they normally do n't do . 
  normally they are escorted in the uk `` area of interest '' , but this time it seems they actually breached uk airspace . 
   the british aircraft carriers are n't nuclear powered , which mean less payload capability for the ship , as they need big fuel tanks . 
  largely correct , but the qe-class are 1.6 x the displacement of the cdg , so it 's not so much a difference with the french fleet , given the qe-class are so much larger , it is however a difference in design - this way the royal navy operates an always at-sea carrier fleet , whereas the french navy can not do so , and is currently without an aircraft carrier for 18 months . 
   the whole ssn fleet is out of order for technical reason , which is a huge problem for the security of their future naval group . 
  some ( maybe all , unconfirmed ) trafalgar-class boats are in for maintenance , but the astute-class are fine , one just left the clyde for deployment 4 days ago . 
   their brand new destroyers ca n't sail in warm waters , for technical reason . 
  again , untrue . 
  hms daring completed a 9 month deployment in the mediterranean , gulf and indian ocean earlier this year . 
  there were issues with the northrup grumman intercoolers on some t45s , but short term fixes have been done and full replacements are to be started next year . 
  that 4chan guy just does n't ever stop, 
  dunno man , was scorching hot in leicestershire earlier , then went horrifically overcast , and now is blue-skies at 18 \u02dac . 
  not bad , to be honest . 
  in terms of displacement , yes . 
  they 'll be roughly 71,000 tonnes , compared to the ford-class at around 100,000 tonnes . 
   intelligence expenses incorrect . 
  that 's out of the [ single intelligence account ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_intelligence_account ) . 
  ww2 pensions would frankly be peanuts , too . 
  actually it 's a better rule of thumb that only 1 in 3 ships are available at any one time . 
  there are currently 2 us carriers deployed and 1 on forward deployment ( sea trials ) , with 3 in pre-deployment . 
  whenever i meet someone not from the uk they always comment on our world class propaganda and wish to obtain tips on how to produce their own . 
  it really is what the uk is known for , nobody else does it , or ever has done it . 
  secretary of state rex tillerson actually just made an impromptu visit to the uk to apologise and speak with boris johnson about the leaks . 
  seems uk outrage hit the mark , i guess . 
  i ca n't remember a us sos ( unfortunate initials ) ever coming to the uk to apologise or speak about a grievance the uk has had with the us before . 
  friendship ended with uk now russia is my best friend, 
   one kink in the plan is the fact that the majority of our trade is with the uk yeah , canada exports roughly an equal amount to the uk than germany , france , spain and italy combined . 
  that implies the uk does not want growth because its q1 is often weak . 
  clearly and obviously untrue .
