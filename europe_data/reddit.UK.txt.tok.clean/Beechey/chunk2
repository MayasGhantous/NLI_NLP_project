  their situation inside the uk is vastly better than ours in terms of local power . 
  they get a local parliament , to deal with scottish issues , and 59 mps in westminster . 
  not to mention that scotland and wales both have better representation in the house of commons than england does . 
  - england : 99,460.51 people per mp - scotland : 89,745.76 people per mp - wales : 76,586.4 people per mp - northern ireland : 100,603.5 people per mp i do n't think that your assessment of my statement on cyprus is correct either . 
  the uk played a massive role in keeping the peace in cyprus , as well as supporting the merging of the republic of cyprus and the turkish republic of northern cyprus , as well as being a guarantor of the republic of cyprus . 
  i feel like you 're trying to say that the deaths of british people are justified . 
  if that is the case , then you are despicable . 
  and your comparison between akrotiri and dhekelia , and the falkland islands is well off . 
  i believe that was what david davis said . 
  number 10 slapped him down quite quickly . 
  the only person you should look to for concrete plans in this government is theresa may . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  it is disgusting , but it 's not the only place where a certain nationality can be targetted for no reason , other than that nationality . 
  in cyprus for example , there 's a wide knowledge in tourists that british people can be attacked ( and often stabbed ) . 
  my younger brother who went often heard people saying that they wanted to play `` stab a brit '' . 
  this kind of stuff is possible absolutely ** everywhere ** on this planet , regardless of which government taxes the population . 
  do n't bring your anti-british rhetoric and assume everyone will just take it . 
  almost every single one of your comments that i see are disgracefully biased . 
  if you 're so offended by british people and the british state , why not give actual answers other than just silly rhetoric ? 
   something the size of england with it 's 007 perfidious albion running around , can never be allowed unchecked power in european orbit . 
  either they bow down and have their gchq become an open book to the eu , or a cold war between us and them starts out the moment they try to make `` global friends '' without asking us first . 
  you seem so bitter . 
  no , it never was . 
  david cameron said he 'd do it immediately , but did n't . 
  theresa may 's office has always said it categorically ** wo n't ** be this year . 
  did n't think of that . 
  you 're right . 
  were eu nationals allowed to vote in the independence referendum though ? 
  and how many 16/17 year olds voted in scotland in 2014 ? 
  no , i meant the absolute figure . 
  no , he did n't . 
  your point is that the uk is a supranational state ( like the eu , you said ) , and the republic is categorically nothing to do with that . 
  you 're now confusing yourself . 
  you 're now conflating a matter of opinion with a matter of historical fact . 
  there would have been a british football team if the home nation 's fa 's had merged , but they did n't . 
  they are now much too established to do it , unless government pushed for it or something . 
  not even remotely like that . 
  scotland bankrupted itself with a failed colonisation of central america , which cost scotland 25 % of the wealth of the entire country . 
  england offered to reimburse scotland for the losses if they voted for union , so they did . 
  it was not even close to a military annexation . 
  so now you 're talking about something which you still do n't understand . 
  the various football associations in the uk are separate because they were all formed at around the same time , and did not want to merge to create a single association , so they stayed separate , and thus , england , wales , scotland and the northern irish football associations remained separate . 
  many reject the argument for a uk team just to boost the performance , the vast majority prefer their home nation teams . 
  i ca n't believe you 're basing your false point on the assumption that because the home nations play in different teams , they ** must ** be separate sovereign states . 
  it 's retarded . 
  i do n't agree . 
  now with both the conservative and labour parties support leaving the european union , the only likely political points to be scored is with * what kind * of deal the uk has outside . 
  the liberal democrats are positioning themselves as a `` keep us in no matter what '' party , and it 's not helping them in the polls . 
  well , more of them voted to stay in the uk than voted to stay in the eu . 
  legally , you are correct . 
  from a democratic point of view , it absolutely is binding . 
  the political fallout from ignoring a nationwide referendum would be very damaging . 
  that is the view of the british government , the european commission and i would imagine , a majority of mps . 
  that is not true , at all . 
  the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland is the state that is internationally recognised . 
  scotland , england , wales and northern ireland are its constituent parts . 
  they are not sovereign , the uk is . 
  it is not a supranational state because its constituent parts are not sovereign . 
  it is a unitary state , with various forms of devolution . 
  like i said , the aircraft is not optimal , but it is not catastrophic . 
  it will make operations more tricky . 
  for a nation that is used to operating the sea harrier on carriers ( which had a max takeoff weight of ~ 26,000 lb ) , this is practically a godsend . 
  it 's no surprise the royal navy ca n't wait to get it . 
  i trust the mod has looked into the respective statistics of both variants and concluded that they can work with the reduced capabilities . 
  i suggest you look up the payload ( ~ 80 % the max takeoff weight of the c variant ) and range ( ~ 75 % the combat radius of the c variant ) limitations on the f-35b , it is not * that * severe . 
  it ** is ** worse than a catobar system , but not a catastrophe . 
  the ski ramp simply provides extra lift for the aircraft ( compared to say the usn/usmc [ america-class ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/america-class_amphibious_assault_ship ) , which would be a much worse alternative ) . 
  it likely wo n't affect operations that much , especially as the raf invests further in the storm shadow cruise missile , negating the lesser range for a longer missile range , it has its tradeoffs . 
  only major issue with a ramp is interoperability and range/armament load ( but its not * that * big of a difference ) . 
  you wo n't hear people saying `` i really wish our carriers were catobar in the falklands war '' , simply because it did n't make that much of a difference . 
  in fact , the turnaround time of fixed wing aircraft was much lower ( as there was way less maintenance on the flight deck after every launch ) , meaning it allowed for more sorties , with less aircraft . 
  yep , the only active class of ship with a larger displacement is the nimitz-class , and soon to be the gerald r ford-class . 
  no current russia/indian/chinese carriers really even come close . 
  i beg to differ . 
   if it was n't for him taking the moral high ground over your fascist , nazi collaborating regime in ww2   if it was n't for the russians , you mean . 
  clearly , you did n't say russia only put in the ` most ' effort . 
  which is debatable anyway , if any of the main allies were not in the war , it likely would not have been won . 
   the war in italy was mostly against nazigerman forces and what remained of the fascist loyalist . 
  `` not to mention that the soviets did n't liberate your country from ** fascism ** , that was britain , the united states and canada . '', 
  that point stands . 
  there was n't a single turning point in the war . 
  north africa was a turning point , battle of britain was a turning point , invasion of ussr was a turning point , stalingrad ( of course ) was too . 
  there were many . 
  would italy have preferred to have stayed occupied by german forces then ? 
  if not , you were liberated ( at great cost ) . 
  quite simple . 
  the noises coming out of your government suggest otherwise . 
  normal spaniards might not care , but the elected representatives of your greater population certainly seem to . 
  i suggest that is why gibraltar pointed the statement towards your head of state , not `` gibraltar to the people of spain '' . 
   if it was n't for the russians , you mean . 
  claiming that * only russia * won the second world war is simplistic and stupid . 
  without 2 fronts and a massive lend lease programme by the uk and the us , sailing arctic convoys , delivering hundreds of tanks , planes , trucks , guns , and millions of bullets every month , russia would not have had the supplies to fight such a war . 
  in 3 years , britain alone delivered to russia : - 3,000 + hurricanes - 4,000 + other aircraft - 27 naval vessels - 5,218 tanks - 5,000 + anti-tank guns - 4,020 ambulances and trucks - 323 machinery trucks - 2,560 universal carriers - 1,721 motorcycles - # 1.15 bn worth of aircraft engines - 600 radar and sonar sets - hundreds of naval guns - 15 million pairs of boots and the united states : - 427,284 trucks - 13,303 combat vehicles - 35,170 motorcycles - 2,328 ordnance service vehicles - 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products - 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs - 1,911 steam locomotives - 66 diesel locomotives - 9,920 flat cars - 1,000 dump cars - 120 tank cars - 35 heavy machinery cars the western front sucked 2 million german troops out of action in the east in the final 2 years of the war , that would have made russia 's push towards germany damn near impossible to overcome . 
  not to mention that the soviets did n't liberate your country from fascism , that was britain , the united states and canada . 
  tell me again that only the soviet union won the war . 
  because the british border is at calais , and the french border is at dover . 
  passport controls are held on the opposite side of the channel for each respective country . 
  part of the le touquet agreement . 
  before it was in place , people would show up off the eurostar without adequate documentation , and immediately claim asylum . 
  do n't look at us !,
