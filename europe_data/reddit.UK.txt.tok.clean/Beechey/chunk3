  not sure you understand how article 50 works . 
  if there was an easier way , do n't you think the uk govt would use it ? 
  you ca n't simply `` fuck off '' . 
  it needed to say it because it was a najor point during the referendum , and they want to appear as if they 're doing something . 
  well if it were guaranteed , then the uk has no reason to oppose the organisation , seeing as it likely will occur after we 've buggered off . 
  yes , do you really think a proposition will be advanced enough in the planning stages in time for us to even think if vetoing it ? 
  we have around 2 years more in the eu , it will likely take a bit longer than 2 years to design and plan the implementation of something so ambitious . 
  exactly . 
  nothing has been vetoed . 
  if it came to a vote tomorrow , sure we would veto it , but it 's likely that michael fallon is just saying `` do n't put it on the table before we 're out '' . 
  everyone in this thread is talking as if the uk has vetoed it , and nothing of the sort has happened . 
  there wo n't be any concrete vote for a couple of years anyway . 
  erm , russia has 18 ssns , 7 cruise missile submarines and 13 ballistic missile submarines , not 500 . who knows how many of these are actually operational at a decent level of safety . 
  probably not many . 
  well it depends on the budget and scope of the organisation . 
  nasa , arguably the most advanced space faring organisation on the planet , only has a budget of around # 15bn . 
  the uk could operate both with the esa and alone , although the start-up costs would likely be the major drawback . 
  we would n't be having this discussion if the heath government had n't axed black arrow . 
  the uk is the only country ever to have developed satellite launch capability , and then dropped it . 
  all other countries to have developed it , have maintained that capability . 
   wealth transfer to london  `` ifs warns scottish deficit has become three times greater than uk 's '' ... 
  right . 
  chances for czechoslovakia are n't very good , you 're right . 
  guys , i * never * saw this coming . 
  the united kingdom of ** great britian and northern ireland ** is a sovereign state . 
  scotland , wales , england , or northern ireland do not have recognition as independent nation states , because they are n't . 
  the constituent parts of the uk compete in other sports ( like football ) as separate teams as when the football association ( fa ) was formed , it was not certain if it covered all of the uk . 
  when the scottish football association was formed , it was clear that it only covered england ( being based there ) . 
  then wales and ( then ) ireland formed their associations , all competing . 
  no plans at all yet for there to be a uk football team . 
   norway has stated that it would block the uk from joining the efta . 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-efta-idukkcn10t1e0 )  `` it would be wrong to flag a veto or no veto now , and i believe anyway that we will find good solutions to these problems , '' solberg said . 
   she said it was important for all countries to set out their national interests in the debate . 
  `` then all must be prepared for anything , if it turns out that britain joins efta , '' she said . 
  thing is though : their defence policy is abysmal too . 
  [ haha , you got me .

  oh good lord . 
  the man is crazy . 
  does he not realise that they 're not identified by potential enemies by whether they carry a nuclear warhead , just by the fact it 's an icbm ( as basically their only use is to carry a nuclear warhead ) . 
  he 'd inadvertently start a nuclear war by putting non-nuclear munitions on a ballistic missile and launching it . 
  either that , or he 'd have to tell all nuclear states in the region that we 're launching a ` conventionally armed icbm ' . 
  i ca n't even ... 
   to be independent from the yanks . 
  that could be done without leaving nato , we 'd just need to invest sufficiently into our armed forces ( most reputable sources agree between 3 % and 4 % of gdp , meaning around # 70bn to # 80bn per year , as opposed to the ~ # 40bn we spend currently ) . 
  lack of investment leaves capability gaps that only the united states can plug . 
  did he really think we could get away with putting he warheads on an icbm ? 
  where are his defence advisors ? 
  the only real use for ballistic missile submarines with no ballistic missiles would be to convert them to launch conventional cruise missiles instead . 
  provides * some * of the same capabilities that ballistic missiles offer ( bar the submarine needing to get dangerously cloae to the coastline , and the relatively low-flying cruise missiles , which are comparatively easy to shoot down ) . 
  passporting is the only real potential issue down the road for financial services . 
  it 's why i 'm so confident the uk will join the eea and retain the right at the very least . 
  at least , that 's the very worst available option given the circumstances . 
   tell me what can london offer that new york ca n't offer ? 
  err , the timezone ? 
  one of london 's main attractions is that it sits between the closing of new york , and the opening of shanghai . 
  thinking of `` frankfurt vs london '' , london uses english contract law , it also is the largest centre for derivatives markets , foreign exchange markets , money markets , issuance of international debt securities , and international bank lending . 
  it has the major infrastucture and government policy to back it up . 
  a major threat to the city was the proposed financial transaction tax , which is to begin in september , both germany and france are taking part in it ( funnily enough , the tax targets many of the specialisations of london , listed above ) . 
  the tax is not extreme by any measure , but it does set a precedent for an increase of those taxes , which would damage any would-be [ alpha + + ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_city#gawc_study ) financial centre . 
  tell me , if the city is going to collapse , why has n't any major bank left the shores of the uk for germany yet ? 
  why has the ftse100 ( mostly foreign corporations ) now way above where it was pre-brexit vote ? 
  all a bit odd if the end if coming , is n't it ? 
  [ oh yeah , i 'm sure . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palair#fleet ), 
  in fairness , italian gdp was growing at a similar pace to germany up until the gfc . 
  something has [ been catastrophic since ] ( https://www.theatlas.com/charts/bjkjs-ot ) , though . 
  yeah , the harriers , along with the ark royal were scrapped in 2010/11 . 
  i 'm not saying the warm climate does n't have an adverse affect . 
  what i am saying is people need to stop saying `` warm water makes the ships stop working , they are terrible ships '' . 
  again though , the outages have been remedied in the short term . 
  well firstly , that 's not why the type 45s are in , but okay . 
  secondly , the type 26 is not ` on hold indefinitely ' , i 'm sure you 're aware it 's only 60 % designed , and that there was just a # 200m contract awarded for the 5 '' main gun . 
  the astute collisions are literally nothing to do with the boat , you 'll likely find the co of the one that recently collided with a merchant vessel will probably be absolutely hammered and maybe discharged . 
  i 'm also sure you 've been keeping yourself up to date with the pretty solid designs of the type 31 , primarily bae 's two versions : the avenger-class and the cutlass-class . 
  like i said , they 're not ` shit ' . 
  ` shit ' , like what ? 
  the incredibly advanced submarines , or the incredibly advanced anti-air destroyers ? 
  sure , you 're right . 
  but that was because the allies made giant steps forward in aircraft design and development , and that the us was able to outproduce japan on literally every measure , not to mention that japan lacked a decent field of pilots , the us was able to rotate men on deployment , japan struggled significantly on that measure . 
  like i posted , it is roundly beating previous aircraft on test runs and test operational deployments . 
  the f-35 is a strike aircraft remember , its primary purpose is to deliver munitions on the ground , it is not built around being an ` air superiority ' aircraft , and yet it is still beating previous generations in that field . 
  i 'm not saying the f-35 is the best thing since sliced bread , but all the hate around it is stupid . 
  if the pilots that have actually seen combat say it is better than what they have flown before , on successful missions , then i 'm happy to trust them . 
   right , the f-35 , which a ) likely wo n't even be in production by the time the first carrier is ready at this rate uk has already taken control of 4 f-35s , a full squadron is planned for 2018 . 
  more than 250 f-35s have been produced already . 
   and b ) is outperformed in combat by some 4th gen fighters it 's very telling that the people that actually fly the aircraft sing its praises , and commenters , who most of the time , have absolutely no flying or military experience are the first to rip it apart .

  whoops , may have done . 
  apologies . 
  i 'm replying to lots of people that are regurgitating this ` engine problem ' thing . 
  you 're right though , the mod will likely need to foot the bill for rolls royce to fix the issue . 
  i 'm sorry , but you 're wrong here . 
  they were never designed to be nuclear , they are classified as a ` super-carrier ' due to their displacement being around 75,000 t , they were only one was planned as catobar , and that plan lasted only two years anyway . 
  only being able to operate stovl ( not vtol ) aircraft does n't matter particularly much as the faa is operating the f-35b anyway , along with the raf . 
  nobody now thinks `` if only we had conventional aircraft in the falklands conflict '' , having jump-jets was absolutely crucial to the success of the task force , it allowed them to take off and land in locations that conventional aircraft could only dream of landing . 
  attack the cvf project all you want , but you ca n't name a country with a more capable aircraft carrier than the qe-class , that is n't the united states . 
  people need to stop spouting this ` warm water ' thing . 
  hms defender had a completely successful deployment to the ** very warm ** arabian gulf recently , and just returned to portsmouth .
