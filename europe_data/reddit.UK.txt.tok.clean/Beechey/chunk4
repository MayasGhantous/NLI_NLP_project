  despite the fact that hms defender just returned from very successful deployment to the arabian gulf ? 
  they 're not in portsmouth because of engine problems , sources from within the rn state that the issue has been solved in the short-term . 
  hms dauntless is there because of it being mothballed due to manpower constraints , for example . 
  - ** hms daring ** -- test-fired aster missile 11/7/16 . 
  due to deploy to gulf soon ? 
  - ** hms diamond ** -- completed operational sea training . 
  has just returned from scottish waters . 
  - ** hms dragon ** completed major refit , recommissioned 8/7/16 and has just returned from visit to ireland and then amsterdam . 
  - ** hms defender ** -- undergoing routine maintenance after returning home on 7th july from successful 9-month deployment to the gulf . 
  - ** hms duncan ** -- completed gulf deployment last year . 
  been in uk waters and led jutland 100 commemorations in may . 
  now in refit . 
   from http://www.savetheroyalnavy.org, 
  may is a solid middle ground . 
  she ` campaigned ' for remain ( just barely ) , but has a lot of experience . 
  she has somehow managed to avoid becoming as toxic as other remainers on the conservative front bench to leave voters . 
  she 'd need to stack leavers in her cabinet though ... 
  it 's more likely theresa may will become pm on the most recent odds . 
  it 's not the gdp that 's the problem , it 's the 10 % budget deficit ( 2008 uk sized deficit ) that scotland has . 
  there 's only one way to reduce that realistically : cutting the budget , or raising taxes . 
  i think it 's obvious now that basing a budget from something like oil is impractical and frankly dangerous . 
  of course , then there 's the potential border , and the fact that [ scotland does around 65 % of its trade with the rest of the uk ] ( https://fullfact.org/sites/fullfact.org/files/scottishexports.jpg ) . 
  it stinks of more uncertainty than even the uk leaving the eu . 
  i 'm not saying he 's not good at articulating his arguments , but the remain campaign have been using him as a sledgehammer , and most media outlets would have expected him to be brutal in a debate vs. boris , considering some of the comments he 's made . 
  of course , he could have done a 180 and performed as expected ( which would be pretty well ) , but i 'm fairly certain most would have expected him to once again be rolled out as the battering ram he has bee for the past few weeks . 
  cameron will not get on a stage against boris johnson , ever . 
  boris is david 's likely successor , so he risks expediting that if he performs badly against boris . 
  cameron has 58 % of the conservative mps , boris has 42 % , and around 61 % of their voters/party members ( excluding wnv/dk ) . 
  i guess no major because he 's been more or less just flinging personal insults for the past month , and that would not go down well on live tv , in front on millions . 
  this is literally my exact thoughts too . 
  free movement to me is the weakest argument for leaving , i personally care passionately about sovereignty and democracy , and not at all about immigration . 
  no , i think you 're wrong on that point . 
  norway accepts 70 % of ** directives ** . 
  overall , [ with most laws ( regulation etc ) included , the figure is estimated between 9 % and 28 % ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/norway-switzerland-eu-laws ) . 
  i agree though , we wo n't be in the eea . 
  i 'm not sure where this is from ? 
  do n't get me wrong , the uk joined because europe was outperforming us , but the uk did not recover because of it joining . 
   do n't even know you were part of efta before joining and it sucked for you is what i was targeting specifically . 
  that [ `` 90 % of economists '' ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3739/economists-views-on-brexit.aspx ) figure is as rubbished as the '' # 350 million a week '' figure . 
  3,818 economists were polled , 639 replied , and of that ~ 16.7 % of replies , 88 % thought it most likely that real gdp would be negatively impacted in the next 5 years , if the uk left the eu and the single market . 
  so what is it ? 
  if you knew anything , you 'd note that the british economy in the 1960/70s had nothing to do with efta or the eec . 
  british industry had largely collapsed as coal had become less economical , making energy more expensive . 
  as a result , unions performed general strikes , and the government introduced a 3 day working week . 
  high inflation led to high prices and a fall in the standard of living . 
  the british economy did not revive because of the eec , it was revived through deregulation and privatisation of overly expensive industries ( whether we like it or not today , this is the case ) . 
  thatcher , in the 1980s reformed the uk economy from one based on industry , to one based on services . 
  many call it the ` industrial holocaust ' , but one thing is for sure : we were n't the sick man of europe any more , and our membership of efta or the eec had very little to do with that . 
  so compassionate to your fellow europeans . 
  i think that is * technically * the case . 
  but the ot are not sovereign states . 
  also , as per my understanding of the washington treaty , only gibraltar would fall under the protection of nato  the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
   any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the security council . 
  such measures shall be terminated when the security council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security . 
  he answered you . 
  london covers the defence of all overseas territories . 
  ot are not part of the uk , so do n't get taxed by hmrc . 
  what 's hilarious is that if i 'm on the spanish google variant , search for wikipedia , the english version is higher up the list than the spanish one . 
  easy , www.google.es, 
   desperately clinging to the remains of their empire how many times am i going to have to read this crap ? 
  nobody i speak to has any affinity for the empire , because when most were alive , it was dissolving . 
  it 's a dirty word here for the most part and it seems only those not from the uk or who have a vendetta against the uk seem to believe we yearn for the return of empire . 
  it 's very boring now . 
  yes , and that government was roundly demolished in the 2010 election . 
  i do n't know , [ neisr estimates ] ( http://www.niesr.ac.uk/media/press-release-gdp-growth-05-cent-2017q1-12839#.woihm1pyufw ) uk q1 growth at 0.5 % . 
  compared to the same quarter last year , it is 0.3 % higher ( if this ** preliminary ** estimate is correct ) . 
   i 've seen a ton of people mass fighting in middle of small town weird , i live near a small town and have never seen this . 
  i 've also seen the russian reports that 36 tomahawks failed . 
  i do n't believe that failure rate , but it 's something to keep in mind . 
  let 's not pretend like a tomahawk is weak either , it has a ~ 500kg warhead . 
  that seems remarkably silly . 
  is there a wh press report on that or something i can see ? 
  wow , if they 're able to take it they 'll get access to a barren ruin . 
  59 tomahawk cruise missiles is going to have absolutely decimated it . 
  they 'll be wasting more manpower trying to fix it up than it 's going to be worth . 
  and no , they are not attacking the airbase , why , you may ask ? 
  because they are nowhere near it . 
  they are attacking a totally different airfield . 
  in fairness , in comparison to the promises cameron made in 2013 , he did n't get much . 
  well no , 62-38 were in favour of staying on david cameron 's negotiated terms , i feel like people are forgetting that the offer was stay on what cameron got , or leave . 
  we have no idea what it might have been if cameron had not bothered or got absolutely nothing . 
  as i said , i 'm speaking about france 's importance to any potential eu military . 
  the fact that france is able to deploy at long range for prolonged periods of time is hardly non-important , especially when eu forces are deployed globally right now ( see [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_atalanta ) - try and claim a globally-deployable navy is not important ) . 
  france is one of few eu nations capable of any form of major heavy lift capability , meaning it can transport some vehicles , aircraft and personnel . 
  again , not non-important , as you seem to be suggesting . 
  that headline seems ominous . 
  it 's the uk 's relationship with its overseas territories more than anything . 
  we seem to have varying levels of autonomy for each territory , which makes it appallingly complicated . 
  russia is not even part of the g8 anymore ( now g7 ) . 
  a lot of states simply do not have the means . 
  even those which have the funds ( like nigeria ) struggle with their own insurgencies . 
  the terrain , porous borders and lack of general african cooperation hurts the effort more than anything else i think . 
  sorry , who said anything about what an eu military would need to be ? 
  all i stated was france 's current capability , and its importance to a potential eu military . 
  whatever shape the defence union takes is up to them . 
  read down my comments , i agree with that . 
  it depends on what shape an eu force takes , but i think it will mimic the netherlands and germany 's cooperation with joint battalions and what-not , and wo n't be centralised . 
  depends on the actual shape a joint force takes . 
  i personally agree with you . 
  i do n't think it will ever be totally centralised , but i think there will be joint divisions ( for example potentially similar to how germany and the netherlands are integrating ) .
