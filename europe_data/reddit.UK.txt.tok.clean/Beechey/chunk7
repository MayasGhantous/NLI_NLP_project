  you too !, 
  ah right , gotcha . 
  i thought you meant the 2016 quarterly growth averaged out at 1.8 % ( can see why i was confused ! ) . 
  that makes sense though , the 1.8 % refers to yoy for each quarter averaged out , the 2 % figure refers to normal annual change . 
  wow i thought i was going mad !, 
  so it does appear to be 2 % ( which makes sense , given the rounded quarterly growth ) for the year ( quarterly growth added up ) , as opposed to 1.8 % that bbc is citing . 
  no you wo n't see it actual say 2.1 % on there , it does say that the quarterly growth is 0.2 , 0.6 , 0.6 and 0.7 % respectively though . 
  looking deeper , the ft says growth was 2 % for 2016 ( so i 'm guessing they calculated it using more precise figures ) . 
  i 'm just totally baffled as to where this figure of 1.8 % growth for 2016 is coming from on all of these articles . 
  edit : seems [ business insider ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-aftermath-second-estimate-uk-gdp-q4-2017-2?r=us&amp;ir=t ) says 2 % ( cut 0.2 % from 2.2 % ) , looks like bbc is alone in saying it is 1.8 % ( cut 0.2 % from 2 % ) . 
  the ons says 2.1 % for 2016 as a year . 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/secondestimateofgdp/quarter4octtodec2016#what-is-the-2016-picture ) . 
  see the current projections for 2016 quarters . 
  it 's released today and says q1 was 0.2 % ( as articles are stating ) , q2 and 3 are 0.6 % and q4 is 0.7 % , which adds up to 2.1 % . 
  even if there were differences as you state , there is surely no way it could amount to 0.3 % in total . 
  i 'm totally stumped . 
  i could just be absolutely shocking stupid though . 
  i do n't get it . 
  the ons says the economy grew with the following rates in their respective quarters quarter | growth rate -- | -- 1 | 0.2 % 2 | 0.6 % 3 | 0.6 % 4 | 0.7 % | year total | 2.1 % i ca n't see how some people are getting 1.8 % , some 2 % , and the [ ons 2.1 % ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/secondestimateofgdp/quarter4octtodec2016#what-is-the-2016-picture ) . 
  i feel like i 'm missing something so obvious here . 
  well it can , but the size of the campaign 's it is capable of has reduced from around ~ 40,000 soldiers in a theatre to 3,000-9 ,000 . 
  the new strike groups announced in the last sdsr commits us to ( iirc ) 50,000 soldiers , sailors and airmen ( might be 30,000 , do n't remember ) able to be committed to a single theatre . 
  you 'd probably need two or three vessels to ensure one is always deployed . 
  funnily enough , the charles de gaulle is now out of service for up to two years for a refit and upgrade , so no , the french navy does not have an aircraft carrier either right now . 
  hms queen elizabeth will be commissioned this year , taking the mantle as europe 's largest aircraft carrier , by a large margin . 
  it 's the industry standard looking at past projections , there 's clearly reason for it , probably long term stability . 
  for example , uk gdp in 2014/15 was estimated at $ 3 trillion , this year , going by this year 's current exchange rate , it would be $ 2.37 trillion , clearly uk gdp has not fallen by $ 630 billion , as the economy has been growing strongly . 
  they have a fine balance to strike , i think . 
  not sure why germany 's is n't $ 3.8 if that 's the ( i think i read it was normally 5 years ) average . 
  well , ons reckons it was just below # 1.9 trillion in 2016 they normally take the average exchange rate over a long period of time to lower the volatility , which would probably be between $ 1.45 and $ 1.55 , so it 's likely anywhere between $ 2.75 trillion and $ 2.95 trillion . 
  early figures are pretty useless though , going to have to wait a couple of months for concrete gdp figures by the ons . 
  well , it 's actually * only * around 20 % bigger than the uk 's . 
  uk economy was just over $ 2.9 trillion in 2016 , and grew by 2 % , germany 's gdp was $ 3.5 trillion and grew by 1.9 % . 
  just a small ^ ^ ^ ~ ~ loan ~ ~ amount of around $ 600 billion !, 
  the uk having its own currency makes it ** very ** hard to compare gdp sizes in dollars , mainly because of how volatile it is . 
  for example , in 2015 the imf measured the uk gdp at over $ 3 trillion because of the exchange rate , it 's not shrank since , but the pound has depreciated since . 
  similarly , germany 's gdp used to be thought to be just over $ 4 trillion , but the euro has also depreciated since then . 
  makes me wish all gdps were just calculated in one currency , if that were even possible . 
  how i 'd love 2008 's rate , our gdp would be rated at around $ 4 trillion now . 
  well shit , that 's a fair one . 
  the ability to conduct terror attacks globally on the scale of 9/11 and cause similar casualty numbers to modern conflicts , and then be protected by a state is not a * real threat * ? 
  well then , i never want to see what a real threat is . 
  maybe so , but the north atlantic council is represented by every one of the 28 nato members . 
  when you 're the linchpin of the alliance and everyone depends on you to fill the capability gaps they 've forced on themselves , you probably deserve that sway . 
  look , afghanistan at the time were harbouring al-qaeda , meaning that they protected them inside their country . 
  if the ira popped back up and started bombing parts of the uk , but were based in the republic of ireland , assured safety by the republic , were guests of the central government , and were fed and housed , and then protected by the republic publicly , would you not say that the republic of ireland was attacking the uk ? 
  that is a like-for-like comparison to the situation in afghanistan in 2001 . 
  al-qaeda at the time were protected by afghanistan , and planned or orchestrated their attacks on nato members from inside the country . 
  that is state sponsored terrorism . 
  no , this conversation is about ** afghanistan ** , not iraq or libya . 
  iraq lacked the go-ahead of the un . 
  libya was an action taken by nato to stop there being a failed state on the mediterranean . 
  obviously it failed in the task , but this was more a failure of the uk , us and france than the nato structure . 
  neither in iraq or libya was article 5 triggered . 
  stop the strawman arguments . 
   the alliance 's 1999 strategic concept had already identified terrorism as one of the risks affecting nato 's security this was basically state-sponsored terrorism . 
  the taliban allowing the perpetrators free access into afghanistan and allowing them safe-haven to attack nato countries at will , then refusing to hand them over to answer for what they 'd done was tantamount to a state ( taliban 's afghanistan ) sponsoring the acts , which they essentially were . 
  that 's without saying that the 9/11 attacks killed more people in one morning than all nato coalition forces killed by enemy action in the entire 13 year conflict in afghanistan , so you decide how important that was . 
  the north atlantic council agreed that all of the factors involved indicated that afghanistan at that time was a threat to nato , and had already assisted in the attack on the usa . 
  obviously they felt that all variables had been met to trigger article 5 , and so they triggered it . 
  the taliban ran afghanistan and gave the perpetrators safe-haven status , and refused to hand them over . 
  the north atlantic council of nato agreed that this was a valid reason for the triggering of article ( being collective defence , as they could just use the country as a base otherwise ) . 
  the un then mandated an international force of peacekeepers under the name of [ isaf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_security_assistance_force ) , to be ran by nato . 
  so yes , it was valid . 
  well they triggered article 5 and nato agreed that the taliban ( who were in control of afghanistan ) harbouring the perpetrators and refusing to hand them over was a valid reason for triggering the collective defence clause . 
  from the nato website  the north atlantic council -- nato 's principal political decision-making body -- agreed that if it determined that the attack was directed from abroad against the united states , it would be regarded as an action covered by article 5 . 
  on 2 october , once the council had been briefed on the results of investigations into the 9/11 attacks , it determined that they were regarded as an action covered by article 5 . 
  romania could have just as easily triggered article 5 . 
  it 's not up to the us to bring in nato , but the [ north atlantic council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_atlantic_council ) . 
  ca n't argue with that , but every nato member was involved in afghanistan as a article 5 was triggered . 
  there was an obligation for all nato members to assist . 
  except afghanistan was a legitimate conflict and had the agreement of the unsc and unga . 
  do n't conflate it with iraq . 
  sorry , it 's a live link , so inevitably the title of the article will change , but i 'll paste their part regarding the post below . 
   wolfgang sch\u00e4uble , germany 's tough-talking finance minister , says greece must leave the eurozone if it wants a debt cut . 
   he told german broadcaster ard that debt forgiveness would be in violation of european rules . 
   `` we ca n't undertake a debt haircut for a member of the european single currency , it 's ruled out by the lisbon treaty . 
  for that , greece would have to exit the currency area . 
   the pressure on greece to undertake reforms must be maintained so that it becomes competitive , otherwise they ca n't remain . '', 
  erm nobody was saying the uk has a say in us foreign policy . 
  just that the uk 's decision altered the us ' viewpoint . 
   after all , the uk voting `` no '' ** appears to have been a deciding factor ** in obama not intervening in syria . 
  i try to go on / r/unitedkingdom , but always end up going back to / r/europe or / r/ukpolitics , the subs are much more open to debate and discussion . 
  had n't realised [ all of this ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/11/contents/enacted/data.htm ) was just a lie . 
  absolutely mental . 
  not sure why you got the downvote , [ john kerry said it himself ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/05/john-kerry-us-syria-intervention-plan-britain-obama ) . 
  a scottish currency would likely need to peg to the pound sterling or euro to survive , otherwise it would fluctuate like crazy on any bad economic news coming from the ruk . 
  of course then your monetary policies really are n't your own . 
  at 100 miles almost all military surface vessels would be able to be detected . 
  100 miles in the vastness of say the north atlantic ocean ( 16,020,000 ^ ^ 2 miles ) is nothing . 
  in fact , some radar systems will be able to detect a surface vessel at a relatively similar distance , too . 
  [ errr ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/22/uk-to-permanently-station-1000-military-personnel-in-poland-from-2017 ) , [ oh jeez ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36739781 ) , [ ooph ] ( http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2015/june/08/150609-baltops-in-poland ) . 
  [ oh , and this ] ( http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/01/12/us-troops-enter-poland-1st-deployment-russia-doorstep.html ) . 
  the fact is that scotland 's total budget between 2010 and today is around 3.4 % smaller . 
  pales in comparison to other uk-wide government cuts . 
  again , my statement said scotland 's budget has just gone up by # 1 billion , this means that between the last budget ( one year ago ) and this year 's budget , westminster has allocated scotland # 1 billion extra . 
  whether or not the budget since 2010 is smaller or not does not change this statement . 
  every single uk department bar maybe 2 or 3 have had larger cuts , as have likely most local authorities in england . 
  this really is n't difficult to grasp . 
  i can tell you right now that scotland 's over reliance on oil has hurt the country more than a 3.8 % budget cut over the last 7 years .
