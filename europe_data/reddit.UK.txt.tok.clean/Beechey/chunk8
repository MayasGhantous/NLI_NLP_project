  are you kidding ? 
  the two sentences mean totally different things and a sub-standard gcse student could easily decipher the difference . 
   scottish funding from westminster has just increased by around # 1 billion is not the same as  scottish government budget is # 1 billion more now than it was in 2010 it means it 's # 1 billion more now than it was last year . 
  obvious , no ? 
  well at most it [ should be a 3.8 % drop since 2010 ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/has-the-scottish-budget-increased-or-decreased-since-2011-1-4350931 ) . 
  clearly not trying to ` cripple ' scotland . 
  if scotland can not cut just shy of # 1.4 billion then i 'm not sure what to say . 
  3.8 % frankly is tiny compared to what other government departments and local authorities have had to endure . 
  if i remember correctly , defence alone has had around a 16 % cut since 2010 and are to cut another # 500-600m this year apparently . 
  it happens under fiscally conservative administrations . 
   under a tory government hellbent on crippling scotland for being uppity . 
  i 'm sorry mate , but scottish funding from westminster has just increased by around # 1 billion and you 're claiming that ? 
  scotland 's economic woes are because successive scottish governments have placed too much emphasis on oil extraction , refinement and exportation . 
  with the price collapse , it is no surprise that it has damaged the economy . 
  time to diversify the economy . 
  yeah , those cluster bombs you claim e are selling to saudi arabia were sold like 30 years ago ... 
  they 're banned under an international treaty of which the uk is a signatory . 
  that would probably eventually come to a good conclusion , but then you 're running the risk of so-called ` neverendums ' . 
  people are very stubborn to change their views most of the time . 
  if i 've learned one thing from the uk over the last few years , it 's that referendums do n't really settle anything . 
  i agree , but the main issue with a supermajority is you are then able to have 59.9 % ( given the limit was 60 % ) of the voting public choose one option and not get what the majority of them voted for , yet the minority vote wins . 
  all systems have drawbacks . 
  ideally , you want a standard majority rule with a supermajority chosen naturally . 
  if the method utilised was a simple majority , then going by that rule , yes , obviously . 
  it might not be ideal , but it 's what was used . 
  obviously under those circumstances the chances of it happening would be very , very slim . 
  depends on how you view it . 
  for example , this was the largest single vote in british history . 
  more people voted to leave the eu than have ever voted for any other single thing of a ballet paper . 
  in that sense it 's pretty major . 
  ... that is an incredibly stupid comment . 
  you 're correct . 
  the issue i take with the previous point however is that the assumption made , that anthony eden was a puppet to the us , common sense and rudimentary modern history knowledge indicates otherwise . 
  but clearly not a ** vassal ** in that instance . 
  able to influence the uk 's foreign policy decisions ? 
  sure , but obviously not held in such high regard by eden that he thought the us had to know . 
  that 's a crazy misinterpretation . 
  surely the fact the uk attacked and invaded another country without talking to the us beforehand runs counter to the main point you 're trying to make ? 
  economic threats by the us and domestic demands forced the uk to withdraw from egypt , and anthony eden to resign . 
  should n't be so hard to work out now , uk pop growth is normally between 0.6 % and 0.8 % , the estimated population last year was 65.11 million and the gdp at the start of 2017 was # 1.87 trillion , meaning the gdp/capita should be around # 28,500 . 
  it does n't `` go '' to anywhere except your national military . 
  the issue is that the vast majority of nato members do not spend adequately , and depend heavily on those that do spend to protect them . 
  i agree . 
  people will inevitably vote for leaders of the parties rather than their local mp in most cases , but that is not the technicality of how our system works . 
  this is more to do with people 's misunderstanding of the westminster system , perpetuated by leaders debates etc. 
  however , the fact remains that the population of the uk do not directly elect prime ministers , no matter people 's lack of understanding of the system . 
  it is not like a presidential system whereby the leader name is on the ballot paper . 
  there are calls for it , as the conservative party and the government is now doing stuff that they never intended at the last election , they did not campaign on this , so some do want a new election to reinforce their position . 
  not to mention there is a widespread belief that if a new election was held , labour would be pummelled , and the conservative party 's position assured with a much larger majority . 
  well it 's more nuanced , since labour has already announced support for triggering article 50 on more than one occasion . 
  you are right , they could opt to not trigger article 50 , and the government would be forced to obey , but at this point it is ** very ** unlikely it will happen . 
  it still does not change the fact that this ruling was not anything to do with giving parliament a vote on our negotiation position though , it only allows the government to begin the process . 
  no , this ruling is simply for parliament to consent to triggering article 50 as theresa may can not use royal prerogative to do it , not giving the green light on any plan . 
  theresa may is granting parliament a vote on the negotiations after they have taken place ( so it 's basically impossible to vote the new relationship down ) . 
  it literally says that in the headline of this page . 
   brexit live - supreme court rules ** uk can not trigger article 50 without parliamentary vote **, 
   economic arguments are irrelevant with emotive issues such as independence did you miss all of 2014 ? 
   ireland did n't make too much of a balls of it well , in fairness [ it was hardly amicable ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-irish_trade_war ) . 
  well of course it is for the government of the country to decide its plan for the future , it does not mean other parties or the opposition can not scrutinise it , and i 'm sure they will to a great extent ( david davis gets beaten up in the hoc like every week ) . 
  the uk system does not allow for directly electing pms . 
  we elect mps to the house of commons whereby the largest party leader is asked by the queen to be her prime minister and to form a government . 
  david cameron was the conservative party leader at the 2015 ge , he got a majority of seats , and the queen asked him to form a government on her behalf . 
  the fact that he then stepped down a year later does not affect our system at all , the new leader ( theresa may ) was then asked to form a government as she was the party leader of the largest elected party . 
  well no it would not be cheaper at all . 
  our warheads and submarines are all configured to launch and utilise the trident d5 slbm . 
  you 'd have to do emergency maintenance on everything and retrain all rn personnel used to dealing with the d5 or the warheads , and refit the submarines at great cost . 
  it could be done , it would just be very expensive . 
  [ i 'm sorry , what ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_army_installations_in_germany ), 
  i just grabbed a screenshot from [ here ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/timeseries/mgsx/lms ) . 
  you 're claiming that [ this ] ( http://image.prntscr.com/image/dbf9fd7cf72548c5a7705f4875bed34c.png ) is not a continuing trend ? 
  that 's absolutely the case i have no doubt . 
  it will be interesting to see the data for the second quarter , after may 's speech . 
  except this is a continuing trend that started well before the pound sterling depreciated in value . 
  well a head of government saying in a public speech that we will leave the single market should have , at the very least , tanked the ftse100 , ftse250 , and the pound sterling according to half of the comments i see on here -- weirdly , all are trading pretty well . 
  maybe most investors have already factored us leaving the sm in . 
  nobody is claiming it will be rainbows and daisies , but saying `` not left yet ! '', 
  at any positive news at this point makes absolutely no sense . 
  businesses look forward . 
  maybe there will be a significant drop if our deal is much worse than what we currently have , but right now , i 'm fairly certain every business knows the uk is heading to the door of the single market . 
  against a well equipped force ? 
  nah , the maintenance and spare parts requirements would be crippling . 
  at most , they may serve as an occupation force , but the logistical chain would consume more funds than you could ever hope to gain in any advantage using such numbers of older tanks . 
  gulf war showed us what happens when a modern mbt goes up against type 69s/t -72 s ( t-72s and type 69s lost almost every time , to the tune of 3,700 losses to 31 -- obviously much of the losses would have been to airpower though ) . 
  much better to have less , better armed and armoured mbts than lots of less equipped tanks in the modern battlefield . 
  part of the reason russia has developed the t-14 . 
   england hey andalusia , how you doing ? 
  according to wikipedia , they have 17,650 older variants in storage , all the way back to the t-55 , which would be utterly useless in modern combat , more of a hindrance to russian forces i would assume . 
  oh fascinating , do you know when a judgement is due ? 
  well maybe i should have said :  that 's not the way this is being viewed ... 
  i think the fact that we have some actual information has absolutely helped this situation too . 
  hopefully no more stupid catchphrases and just substance from now on . 
  no , that 's not the way people are viewing this . 
  parliament gets a vote on our final deal , they can vote for it , or against it . 
  if they vote for it , then we proceed on that deal , if they vote against it then we will likely be forced to leave on wto rules . 
  as article 50 had been triggered , there is no way out of it , so once that 24 month period is over , we are gone . 
  no , i think they mean vote no on the deal , as they will now get a vote . 
  if they reject the deal , then we will inevitably leave with no deal at all , making voting against it very dangerous . 
  you are correct , but it 's the wrong side of the coin still for the eu . 
  in fairness , corporation tax is one of the lower earners for hmrc , it only brings in 6 % of government funding .
