shame . 
  having a word that long will take too much time to say which will decrease efficiency . 
  you know , i get the feeling that this man is n't a qualified doctor . . 
  it 's mainly because by-elections do n't gain the same kind of media coverage as a general election so the lower turnouts do n't give a very accurate view of which party that area truly supports . 
  often times by-elections also result in non-mainstream parties gaining traction and the media makes a big deal about it , even though historically that rarely lasts . 
  it 's why ukips main challenge is to hold on to the seat even though they won comfortably this time . 
  apathy is part of it too , since our turnouts in general are pretty abysmal . 
  last time around we had over a third of the electorate who did n't turn up to vote but even then it was heralded as a good thing since it was at least higher than the election prior to that . 
  this was expected but it 'd be interesting to see if he can hold on to the seat when the real election happens next year . 
  in a by-election the turnout is always much lower than normal . 
  also ukip nearly gained another mp since there was another by-election at heywood and middleton and they were only 2 % away from winning . 
  ... shit . 
  take that thought one step further . 
  they 're strengthening sunni iraq specifically to weaken the kurds . 
  if there were no kurdish forces then they would have no reason to work with isis . 
  it 's less about turkey being fundamentalists themselves and more about fighting the pkk . 
  turkey * really * hates them and will do anything to bring them down , even if it means working with madmen like isis . 
  i 'm not sure about th -  `` if you leave us alone , we wo n't bother you . '', 
  welcome , then . 
  that 'll happen regardless . 
  i 'm british . 
  what 's `` patriotism '' ? 
  do n't worry , it was just a joke . 
  yup . 
  stocked up on earl grey to keep me going through the night . 
  i hope that ends up being the actual result . 
  if it 's something like 51-49 or 52-48 then we 'll just have another referendum in 10 years where the exact same debate with the exact same arguments will be played out . 
  please do n't leave us with the tories . 
  i mean . . whatever . . you guys do what you want . 
  my guess is that the figure is lower for turkey today than it was before since they had all those protests so people might think it is n't as safe to go any more . 
  plus isis is partly our own fault . 
  half the reason they were able to rise up was because our invasion destabilised the region so much . 
  do n't forget that they 're somehow living off benefits too . 
  go , play !, 
  mark duggan ? 
  edit : well apparently that was 3 years ago . 
  time flies . 
  not really . 
  that name is just incredibly common , with something like 20 % of muslim men having it . 
  the same does n't apply to christians or non-religious people . 
  [ nato actually responded to this . 
  ] ( http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/photographs/large/c10382-15a.jpg ), 
  no you do n't . 
  let 's flip that question , you think 57 % of citizens voting against independence is a weak win ? 
  the polls i was referring to were the latest ones from [ icm ] ( http://www.icmresearch.com/data/media/pdf/2014_july_scotlandpoll8.pdf ) , [ tns brmb ] ( http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/uploads/files/tnsuk_som_datatables2014july18.pdf ) , [ survation ] ( http://survation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/scottish-omnibus-july-record-tables.pdf ) , [ yougov ] ( http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ebzazz6em9/times_scotland_results_140629_tuesday_w.pdf ) and another from [ tns brmb ] ( http://scotlandseptember18.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/125385_independence_poll_final_media.pdf ) since they were all the ones released within the last month . 
  after that i averaged out the leads to normalise the data . 
  nationalists generally would n't because their side is the one that lost , but just about everyone else will . 
  for context , they 've trailed by an average of 12 % over the last month . 
  once you take out the do n't knows in the polls then it 's roughly a 57 to 43 defeat , which is quite resounding . 
  the referendum is currently on track to face a strong defeat so i really doubt that these movements are going to be encouraged by it . 
  i was just referring to the general average . 
  there 's always going to be a lot of variation in pretty much every country , especially between richer and poorer regions . 
  i like how over 50 % of niger is under 14 , so their population literally consists of mostly children . 
  anyway , this probably is n't going to affect us anywhere near as much as people think . 
  africa is going through the same thing as the rest of the world in that people are having less kids . 
  for context , the average ethiopian family in 1990 was having 7 kids and today that is down to an average of 4 , for botswana the same figure fell from 4.7 to 2.7 , for ghana it fell from 5.5 to 4.1 and so on . 
  as countries get better living standards they have fewer and fewer kids , and since africa is growing quicker than just about anywhere else they 'll see the same thing but with even bigger drops than most other places . 
  in terms of refugees it 's difficult to say . 
  most of that is linked with violence and oppression rather than just population increases . 
  if europe wants to see a reduction in those then it needs to shift its focus on stabilising african countries . 
  i would 've thought that the oligarchs had more power than this . 
  one of them was n't even able to give this interview until they guaranteed anonymity to him . 
  i 'm glad they won it for klose . 
  were any of the calculations wrong ? 
  i ca n't comment on the other taxes because i 'm not familiar with them but income tax almost always has different bands so paying that much seemed really odd and did n't look correct . 
  it 's not completely clear but if op was mentioning income tax then this is just their individual salary and not the amount of money that the business is making . 
  this makes the same mistake as the other one did . 
  income tax is n't a flat rate and if you 're in the 41.95 % bracket then you do n't automatically pay that exact amount out of your income . 
  i [ looked up the tax rates ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/netherlands/employed_en.htm ) and income tax is currently as follows ; bracket | income | tax rate -- | -- | -- 1 | up to $ 19,645 | 5.85 % 2 | $ 19,645 - $ 33,363 | 10.85 % 3 | $ 33,363 - $ 55,991 | 42 % 4 | over $ 55,991 | 52 % in this case the first $ 19,645 you earn is taxed at 5.85 % and the next $ 355 of your income is taxed at 10.85 % . 
  so if someone is making $ 20,000 then their total income tax bill would be ** $ 1188 ** , not $ 8390 . 
  that 's a huge difference . 
  your effective tax rate is more like 29.91 % . 
  whoever wrote this does n't understand tax brackets . 
  i looked up the [ greek income tax ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_greece#income_tax ) and if someone is making $ 19225 a year then their income tax would amount to $ 1494 , not $ 7625 . 
  if someone is really paying that much then it 's down to them not filling in their tax returns properly . 
  wow , german net migration is 437,000 people per year . 
  that 's a lot higher than i was expecting . 
  i watched watchmen but it was shit so i would n't recommend it . 
  you should post that as a suggestion on / r/enhancement and they might do it . 
  sssh , we 're not supposed to tell people !, 
  are you a masochist ? 
  none that i know of , and hopefully it stays that way . 
  as far as i know you can go to a uk university if you did at least 3 ap exams , which are treated as equivalent to a-levels ( we do these at 17-18 and they 're needed to get in to a university ) so then you 'll be able to apply to go to a university . 
  that 's what i assumed it was too but then i looked it up and it turned out that they treat them the same as gcses . 
  in the uk having a high school diploma is treated as roughly equivalent with getting 5 good gcses ( meaning that you get a c or higher ) , although there is a bit of a discrepancy there since gcses are completed at age 16 whereas a us high school does n't finish until you 're 18 , so if someone intends to go on to study at a university then that diploma is n't going to be enough alone and you 'll probably be required to to do something else before gaining admission . 
   in the mid-21st century , around the year 2050 , a third world war will take place , between the united states , the `` polish bloc , '' britain , india , and china on one side , and turkey and japan on the other . 
  germany and france will enter the war in its late stages on the side of turkey and japan . 
  according to the book , the war will probably be started by a coordinated turkish-japanese sneak attack against the united states and its allies . 
  in the book , friedman hypothesizes the attack will place on november 24 , 2050 , at 5:00 p.m , during thanksgiving day . 
  this is the most batshit crazy prediction i 've read in a while . 
  what if your apartment does n't have a toilet ? 
  this is possible , but it 's worth noting that the [ polling ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#2014_2 ) has been getting closer and closer in recent years and most of them are now showing that britons would vote to stay in rather than leave . 
  young people are also more likely to want to stay in the eu whereas older people are more likely to want to leave , so the longer we wait to have a referendum the more likely it is that people would vote to stay in . 
  i think they 're missing the point . 
  juncker is going to become the president whether cameron likes it or not , but if he makes a big deal about it then eurosceptics in britain might see it as him `` standing up to the eu '' which would help him regain some supporters that the conservatives have been losing to ukip in the last year or two . 
  this is especially important for the conservatives since they 're currently on track to lose the election next year . 
  i saw it and chuckled . 
  the people who 're butthurt about it need to calm down . 
  we played like crap in 2010 and somehow made it to the last 16 . 
  we played well this time around and were out before all the group stage matches had even been played .
