  hooray !, 
   i think in our next exchange i 'll refer to all data that threatens my position as a collection of anecdotes . 
  it seems like a fun way to argue . 
  it amuses me that you consider `` anders breivik '' to be substantive data . 
   where did i say it did ? 
  you references specific examples as a `` failure '' of gun control overall . 
  seeing as they reduce massacres and homicides , the only thing left to do was to complain about them not making homicides extinct . 
  otherwise , what you wrote was simply false . 
   i 'm saying the reduction in crime is n't enough to justify the significant infringement on the rights of everyone else . 
  currently , most of the homicides and massacres in the us are conducted via legally-owned guns . 
  if wiping out most of that does n't justify necessary gun control then you 'll never be happy . 
   `` as you know , our group has had a new uk majority shareholder since july , '' he said in a letter to employees . 
   it is at its request that i moved to london for a specified period . 
  it is by no means tax exile . 
  i already spend more than 40 per cent of my time abroad for the purposes of the group ... so nothing new . '' so he 's not moving due to the tax rise after all . 
   again , facts devastating to your cause ca n't merely be dismissed as `` anecdotes '' . 
  the brevik is the spree killer with the highest body count is quite relevant to the discussion , ** as the overall effectiveness of gun control measures is relevant when considering whether they 're worthwhile ** . 
  and yet the data shows that the overall effectiveness of gun control is successful . 
  vomiting `` anders breivik '' does not change the facts . 
   no , i 'm undermining your notion that he 'd have stopped had he not gotten ammo from the us . 
  then you 're missing the point . 
  the point was that he would 've done less damage , which has been the case everywhere else . 
   you had n't linked to that in previous comments , so i do n't see how you get off being a cunt here . 
  [ i linked to it here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14wlp6/reading_about_the_conneticut_massacre_as_a/c7iz3sp ) so learn to read . 
   and that has nothing to do with the success or failure of a domestic revolution . 
  oh , of course . 
  i 'm sure guerrilla warfare works out just fine with little funding . 
   guess where those billions came from ? 
  the taxpayers that would be revolting . 
  only if enough people do so , and even then , the government would have significantly more equipment and so on to deal with it . 
   because nuclear weapons are n't guns . 
  they 're indiscriminate in who they kill . 
  it 's not possible for an individual to use them without harming others . 
  same can be said for guns considering that no one has 100 % accuracy . 
  crossfire is a thing , too . 
   the facts show that spree killers still get their guns regardless of regulation . 
  false . 
  [ most spree killers got their guns legally ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2012/12/mass-shooting-legally.jpg ) . 
   so you 're still failing to understand this ... no , i 'm not . 
  the crucial distinction here is that gun ownership does n't inherently harm society . 
  neither does rocket launcher ownership or nuclear weapon ownership . 
  it 's what these things lead to that is the problem . 
   he 's not the only spree killer in europe , australia , or any other area with strict gun control . 
  it 's not just one example of the failure of gun control , it 's a series of failures across many nations and ethnic groups . 
  and yet the data shows that less guns decrease gun homicides and massacres . 
  all you 're doing now is using a few anecdotes instead of one anecdote . 
  not to mention strawmanning gun control by pretending that it claims to stop all gun violence ... 
  only 5.5 % ? 
  i hope they 're gon na be alright . 
  productivity is n't a zero-sum game , though . 
  hungary and mexico have identical numbers of people working in small businesses but their productivity is very different . 
  i also see that australia has most people working for small businesses [ yet is more productive ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_hour_worked ) than the uk , sweden , finland etc. 
  looks like this area needs more research . 
   yes , i 'm sure anders brevik would have abandoned his quest for guns and blood if he had been properly restricted . 
  anecdote yet again . 
   a ) if the us was the gun-free utopia you desire he would have gotten the ammo elsewhere or made it himself . 
  oh , look , he 's invoking begging the question again . 
   b ) you 've produced no peer-reviewed papers . 
   ...  which you 've alluded to but never produced . 
  [ learn to read ] ( http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/index.html ) . 
   spree killings are highly unlikely , yet you wish to push your agenda according to their conduct . 
  whoops , i forgot facts and reality had an agenda . 
  i do apologise . 
  -_-  hold up here , because this is hilarious . 
  you seriously think that a film made by an individual in the united states was funded and sanctioned by the government ? 
  that some shadowy us government organization was responsible for it ? 
  that you 're as stupid as the taliban ? 
  read the fucking article . 
  aid is n't distributed very well so the taliban gets billions . 
  the us ends up funding both sides . 
   no , they 're alive and winning because their form of guerrilla warfare is insanely effective against the us military , a lesson civilians ca n't help but learn . 
  the billions from the us help , too , obviously . 
  accurate analysis . 
  * you * keep on stating that it would 've happened anyway . 
  so why not give everyone nukes ? 
  after all , the nuke `` does n't trigger itself '' !, 
   and your argument revolves around `` it would n't have happened if we 'd done x '' . 
  because that 's what the facts show . 
   and i 'm glad you 'd willingly let others succumb to tyranny for your ideology . 
  oh , yeah , more stringent background checks and buy-back schemes sure as hell scream tyranny . 
  poor you . 
   no , this is just an example of you failing to comprehend my arguments . 
  demonstrate how gun ownership is equal to murder . 
  i did n't state it is . 
  what i did state that your logic can also advocate for zero laws because the criminals `` break them anyway '' . 
   you 're willing to twist my words in some childish effort to argue that i advocate murder . 
  why not rape ? 
  come on , if you 're going to be a disingenuous cunt follow through . 
  i have never stated that you advocate murder . 
  try reading for once . 
   debunked ? 
  who debunked my argument ? 
  and , again , the fact that anders brevik murdered more than 100 people despite strict gun control is not an `` anecdote '' , it 's a fact inconvenient to your position . 
  using ** one example ** to base your whole argument ** is ** an anecdote . 
  that 's exactly what an anecdote is !, 
  jesus , do n't be so stupid . 
   nonsense . 
  the fact that other sources of ammunition exist is not ( to my knowledge ) in dispute . 
  but the assertion that he would 've done it anyway is . 
   just as they were in norway .
