  maybe because they actually caught the frauds , and would n't have 10 years ago . 
  this is true , but what i was thinking was that tackling tax evasion could be part of that . 
  reducing the deficit would still be one of the goals , but it would be done in a way where employment and growth are n't completely destroyed , and would provide for better long term stability . 
  if you invest in infrastructure and so on then you 'll create more jobs , which in turn will increase tax revenues and reduce the number of people on welfare , hence increasing revenue and decreasing spending all in one go . 
  wow , that 's around 5 % of the entire population . 
  it 's actually one of the most expensive if you just look at the costs of energy - the only reason we do n't pay as much overall is because it 's barely taxed , although that screws us over in other ways . 
  that 's governments from the past , though , not present governments . 
  chang is specifically referencing austerity which has been going on since 2010 . 
  this is true , but the gap between britons migrating to another eu country and people from eu countries immigrating in to the uk has [ exploded in the last 10 years ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/britains-70-million-debate/5-british-and-other-eu-migration ) , and that 's probably what people want to focus on . 
  i recommend everyone read the [ faq ] ( http://gcbias.org/european-genealogy-faq/ ) that the researchers published . 
  it 's fascinating . 
  leader of a military alliance says that the military should have more influence . 
  gee , there 's a surprise !, 
  he 's getting a little carried away . 
  ukip are doing well because the three main parties have all been in power within the last 3 years and the economy is still doing poorly , which provides the perfect setting to gain support . 
  the `` sea of change '' will only happen if they can maintain this momentum after 2015 . . and that probably is n't going to happen . 
  i 'm neither for nor against it . 
  there 's all sorts of people in all ethnicities and races so it 's hard to look at them as some kind of collective . 
   this is essex i 'm so sorry . 
  apparently , i 'm swedish . 
  so they wanted to get back at the edl by doing the very thing that would justify their existence ? 
  sounds like something out of [ four lions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_lions ) . 
  the law * needs * to change . 
  not just in ireland , but everywhere . 
  it 's ridiculous that only a handful of countries allow for assisted suicide . 
  ... i really need to stop redditing at 3am . 
  is there anything else planned to get back to growth ? 
  it sounds like they 're just assuming that things will be fine solely because austerity would be slowed down . 
  he was a great war-time president and certainly brilliant at keeping up morale in the face of adversity with his speeches ; although he was also batshit crazy for even contemplating something like [ operation unthinkable ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_unthinkable ) . 
  do n't worry , we 'll just blame romanians and bulgarians regardless !, 
  problem solved . 
  it makes sense to challenge this . 
  london is a financial behemoth and the ftt will only ensure that the money is move elsewhere , probably new york . 
  the only way this will work as well as it should is if it is done globally . 
  i was wondering what happened to the racists . 
  kudos to the mods !, 
  the ultra-patriotism worries me a bit , but it 's really nothing out of the ordinary . 
  what * was * sickening were the amount of people seeking vengeance rather than justice . 
  these people are better suited to being in a cartoon . 
  there goes my dream of having super powers . 
  that long a time frame means multiple governments , but the bulk of that is probably churchill and de gaulle , though i 'm not sure why either would think this 'd be a good idea . 
   some 28,500 containers of radioactive waste were dropped into the english channel between 1950 and 1963 . who the fuck thought this was a good idea ? 
  whilst i think that eventually we * have * to move towards an economy where most or all people are n't working ( since everything is automated ) , i do n't think that 'll happen any time soon . 
  currently , there 's no real practical way to implement this . 
  i agree , but this is n't going to happen unless there 's a collaborative effort by several countries . . and that seems very unlikely . 
  ugh , it reminds me of [ these signs ] ( http://www.mouthopenstoryjumpout.com/storage/noblacks.jpg ) from not too long ago . 
  nice one , france !, 
  yes , but as i 've said , winning via forty percent does n't mean she had widespread support . 
  it just displays the flaws of the electoral system . 
  yes , but my point is that it was a misnomer on the basis that the conservatives won around forty percent of the vote every single time . 
  it was more indicative of an unrepresentative voting system than widespread support . 
  i know the press labelled them as `` landslides '' to sell papers , but that does n't make it so . 
  after the war no one has won an election with an outright majority , so it 's safe to say that no politician is really loved very much , including thatcher . 
  also , coalitions are the exception , not the norm . 
   if she was as hated as some claim , then why was she in power for 18 11 years ? 
  because she only needed 40 % of the vote to win ? 
   ministers insist they are not ready to act . 
  the bis issued a statement on thursday night saying : `` the vast majority of companies and directors do comply with the law and they should not be unfairly burdened , so we will focus our attention on those who deliberately seek to break the law . '', 
  it bothers me that they always retort with this . 
  just because tax avoidance is within the law does n't mean that it 's okay or that it does n't cause any harm . 
  besides , cameron 's dad [ used offshore accounts ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/apr/20/cameron-family-tax-havens ) to make money , so i doubt he 'll seriously go after them . 
  english is essentially a global language now so you 'd be able to communicate with a * lot * more people . 
  although if you 're reading and understanding this comment then you know it anyway so i 'm just preaching to the choir now . 
  punishing academia for a shitty government does n't seem like the right course of action to me . 
  besides , from a practical standpoint , wo n't it be better to focus on pure economic pressure instead ? 
  [ the test is here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22000973 ) if anyone wants to take it . 
  yep , and it 's because we do n't make anything . 
  we 're a financed based economy so we do n't really have that much to export . 
  i can only see this being disastrous in the long term . 
  i agree . 
  a better comparison would be to look at those who are unemployed * in addition * to those who are underemployed . 
  all i really got from this is that fraser nelson does n't really understand what climate change is . 
  he seems to think that it 'll just get warmer and warmer until we 're like the sun , even though more extreme weather , like the current never-ending winter , is also supposed to happen . 
  she 's still a nutter , though , so having her be an mep is pretty dangerous regardless . 
  is that from [ this article ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9889432/osborne-vows-to-stick-to-coalitions-economic-plan-despite-loss-of-britains-triple-a-credit-rating.html ) off the telegraph ? 
  only , the [ real moodys report ] ( http://www.moodys.com/research/moodys-downgrades-uks-government-bond-rating-to-aa1-from-aaa--pr_266844 ) does n't state this . 
  the reasons given for the downgrade in the first place are weak growth estimates in the medium term , increasing debt and continued extensions of austerity - none of which austerity is likely to change any time soon . 
  alternatively , the only possibility of the rating going back up ( or even changing the outlook to positive ) if there is `` much more rapid economic growth and debt-to-gdp reduction '' , which is unlikely given that current estimates are constantly being revised downwards for being too optimistic . 
  so , austerity chokes growth and results in our credit rating being downgraded , and osborne 's answer is to [ `` redouble the plan '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-embarrassed-as-uks-credit-rating-drops-8507829.html ) . . of austerity . 
  sigh . . 
  he 's right , although anyone arguing for an eu exit on a business-basis is talking out of their arse anyway , so they should be ignored regardless . 
  the fact that branson needed to point out the obvious is a little depressing , though . 
  because subjectivity can mean just about anything , so using it to quantify rankings makes them meaningless . 
  i quoted the part which was questionable . 
  if `` happiness '' is considered to be integral part of the methodology then the list is n't exactly accurate . 
  there 's also no need for the asinine accusations . 
  counter-proposal : america slashes their military spending by half instead . 
   its quality-of-life index links the results of subjective life-satisfaction surveys -- how happy people say they are the methodology looks sketchy at best . 
  happy new year , guys !, 
  it 's estimated that the american economy will contract by 0.8 % if they end up going over the cliff ( it 'll halve the american deficit in a single year , which is ridiculously quick ) , and that 'll definitely hit europe in terms of trade . 
  this too is at a time when europe is n't exactly doing well , so it 'd be in our best interest if obama and the republicans strike a deal . 
  meh , you deny the evidence on gun control so i should n't be surprised that you deny the evidence in other cases too . 
  [ liar ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14wlp6/reading_about_the_conneticut_massacre_as_a/c7moebn ) . 
  i 've even shown you the exact quotes of what you complained about . 
  double confirmation of your illiteracy it is . 
  how many times do i need to explain it ? 
  [ you wrote ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14wlp6/reading_about_the_conneticut_massacre_as_a/c7lg3xi ) ;  yet still not anything close to `` often '' , given the number of guns and incidence of ownership . 
  [ then i wrote ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14wlp6/reading_about_the_conneticut_massacre_as_a/c7lg3xi ) ;  yet still not anything close to `` often ''  ** gun homicides where innocents are killed account for a tenth of all gun homicides . 
  that 's very oft - **  , given the number of guns and incidence of ownership . 
   ** again , 60 % of guns are owned by 25 % of the population .
