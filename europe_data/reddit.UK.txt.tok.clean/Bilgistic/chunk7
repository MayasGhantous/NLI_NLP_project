  saying `` but look how few have been used '' is insanely disingenuous . 
  ** ( bold is me ) [ then you complained ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14wlp6/reading_about_the_conneticut_massacre_as_a/c7luwxv ) ;  so you 're taking two snippets of my post out of context , ignoring all the text in between and the different subjects of the two paragraphs involved , and you think i have to justify your edit ? 
  i can do the same to you : all you did then was pretend about `` paragraphs '' and me `` taking snippets '' out even thought i had n't omitted anything . 
   i already have . 
  the page lacks details on the criteria involved . 
  then read their citations . 
   none of which provide the information i seek or that you base your argument on . 
  the first one provides a list of the worst mass shootings in the last fifty years , the second provides a map of where they took place , and the last provides details on weaponry and whether they were acquired legally or illegally . 
  by all accounts , that 's exactly what motherjones reported on . 
   past experience reading its content . 
  the general admission of its contributors . 
  the consensus of pretty much everyone on the internet . 
  it 's a lefty rag . 
  that does n't automatically make it biased . 
  faux is right-wing but dismissing them based on solely them being faux is a dangerous game to play . 
  evidence should trump everything . 
   yes , but it has n't targeted us citizens until recently . 
  and at any rate the whole `` war on terror '' is further evidence of my argument that the general level of tyranny is increasing . 
  i always saw it as feigned incompetence myself . 
  the military contractors hold quite a bit of sway in the political realm so going to war is to be expected . 
  it 's a little depressing . 
  britain has similar problems in that regard . 
   knowledge is actually less powerful than high explosives delivered in the form of a missile . 
  trite aphorisms are n't necessarily true . 
  not psychically , but imagine what would happen to those in power if everyone was aware of what happened to anwar-al-awlaki . 
   so this is you admitting you 're intentional misinterpreting what i 've written and have been bashing a strawman ? 
  no , this is me writing that you deem all of gun control a failure based on what you have written . 
  if you mean regulation x or y is a failure , then feel free to say so . 
   in a country of 300,000,000 people it is . 
  even then it is n't . 
  the death of the innocent alone dwarfs that when compared with the total gun homicide rates of other countries . 
  i 'm assuming you 're not a sociopath so you do care about those people , do n't you ? 
   which also did n't provide the information i require . 
  you asked for the breakdown and it has been provided across multiple sources . 
  at this point you 're choosing not to `` believe '' it . 
   which are also impossible to directly compare due to the geographical burden of the war on drugs . 
  except for the fact that none of the violence is present in the us due to the drug war . 
  you can make that argument for , say , mexico , but not for the us . 
   private gun ownership is , for all intents and purposes , banned in those countries . 
  that limitation of personal ownership is kind of what your argument hinges on , after all . 
  no , it 's not banned , and no , limiting ownership outright is different than limiting ownership only to those who need it . 
  the frame here is with the latter . 
   and people have never resorted to desperate means to acquiring guns . 
  irrelevant . 
  most gun homicides are crimes of passion . 
   if you 're going to make your argument from the perspective of lives saved at least be consistent here : guns , alcohol , tobacco , cars , fast food , and skydiving should all be banned . 
  except that i have n't written about banning anything . 
  try a better strawman next time . 
   now you pathetically confused or pathetically disingenuous . 
  our argument over the meaning of `` often '' is quite separate from the argument in which you attempted to conjoin bits of separate paragraphs of one of my responses into a new sentence i never wrote . 
   this is where you attempted to conjoin two separate bits of what i wrote into one sentence , liar . 
  good job on confirming your illiteracy . 
  you wrote what i quoted [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14wlp6/reading_about_the_conneticut_massacre_as_a/c7lg3xi ) ;  yet still not anything close to `` often '' , given the number of guns and incidence of ownership . 
  i quoted this as ;  yet still not anything close to `` often '' ,  given the number of guns and incidence of ownership . 
  either you 're illiterate or you 're a lying sack of shit . 
  which is it ? 
   that mother jones is a biased rag is not something i just made up . 
  i would have similar suspicions of any study commissioned by fox news or other such organizations . 
  being suspicious is fine , but claiming they 're biased based on your suspicion alone is not . 
   and crimes of passion can only be committed with guns . 
  they ca n't , but if all you have around is a spatula then no one is going to die . 
   of course they would be . 
  the only thing the lack of guns could prevent would be mass shootings , mass shootings actually are linked more with mental health , gun control is supposed to quell the majority of one-off shootings . 
   which still happen in countries with strict gun control . 
  therefore , gun control does almost nothing to prevent violent crime . 
  are you trying to sound stupid now ? 
  no one claims that gun control would bring down crime to zero . 
   it is n't . 
  sweet . 
   but for some reason you think this cancels the argument over the discriminatory nature of the weapons in question . 
  it does n't . 
  a nuclear weapon , even used responsibly , will kill innocent bystanders and cause significant environmental trouble . 
  guns do n't have either of these properties . 
  the only time guns do n't hold these properties is if the only people around are the people meant to get shot , and since that only happens in places where very few people live , this would affect most people regardless . 
   stop trying to put words in my mouth . 
  it 's childish . 
  i did n't write that you stated that the answer was yes for both , that 's what i was writing . 
   but in each state the legality of ownership would be something that could be determined . 
  it does , and if you want to contest that , then you 'd need to prove your suspicions . 
   they are not giving me more than a boolean value here . 
  i would n't call it `` keeping it a secret '' as much as `` not disclosing it '' . 
  did you even read it ? 
  below the graph they cited [ this ] ( http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/20/the-worst-mass-shootings-of-the-past-50-years/ ) , [ this ] ( http://o.canada.com/2012/07/17/interactive-map-mass-shootings-in-north-american-history/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.nycrimecommission.org/initiative1-shootings.php ) . 
   no , i 'm assuming they 're biased because for the last six years at least they have been extremely biased . 
  it 's a biased publication that caters to a biased , extreme worldview . 
  it 's the breitbart of the left . 
  based on ? 
   so you 're pointing to undeclared wars in your effort to prove that the us is n't sliding towards tyranny ? 
  you stated that what was going on in war was incomparable - the us has been in a very vocal `` war against terrorism '' for quite some time now . 
   ten years ago the president had n't ever maintained hit lists . 
  things are changing for the worse and our first nero may be in charge soon . 
  we need options , and guns provide them . 
  in the information age your most deadly weapon is knowledge . 
   and you proceeded to intentionally misinterpret what i meant by `` failure '' as the dumbest possible position i could take nope , i 've based everything on what you 've written . 
  you have stated that `` gun control '' is a failure . 
  not `` some measures of gun control '' but `` gun control '' itself . 
   10 % is n't `` often '' . 
  charitably , 10 % would be `` occasionally '' . 
  i would lean more towards `` infrequently '' . 
  three dead innocent people a day is n't infrequent .
