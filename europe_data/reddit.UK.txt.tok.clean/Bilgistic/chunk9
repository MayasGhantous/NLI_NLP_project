  the fact of the matter is that somalia is the only country on the planet that provides full `` freedom '' . 
   yet still not anything close to `` often '' gun homicides where innocents are killed account for a tenth of all gun homicides . 
  that 's very oft -  , given the number of guns and incidence of ownership . 
  again , 60 % of guns are owned by 25 % of the population . 
  saying `` but look how few have been used '' is insanely disingenuous . 
   if by that you mean analysis of your argument , then yes . 
  it 's a bullshit strawman coupled with a little projection . 
  did i stutter ? 
   yes you have . 
  if you 're going to dismiss any real-world evidence that 's harmful to your case then i will do the same to yours . 
  more bullshit and more projection . 
  * you * have n't provided a single bit of evidence apart from simple-minded anecdotes . 
  but hey , we both know it 's because the evidence is n't on your side . 
  have you bothered reading the papers i linked to yet ? 
   again , stop trying to claim i said something i did n't . 
  it 's childish . 
  if you wish to intentionally misinterpret what i say that 's your business . 
  but lying is n't an effective strategy on the internet . 
  lay out what you `` meant '' , then . 
  you wrote that they count as `` failures '' , all the while ignoring the lower gun homicide rates . 
  only logical output of that is you thinking that they claim to remove all gun homicides , which is n't true . 
   no i did n't . 
  christ , learn to read . 
  or how to not lie . 
  you wrote ;  this is not me `` strawmanning gun control by pretending that it claims to stop all gun violence '' . 
  and then . .  they are failures of gun control . 
  make your mind up . 
   i 'm speaking of mother jones . 
  how would you know ? 
  you 're lazy enough to not bother confirming whether your suspicions are true or not . 
   crime done with knives . 
  seems convenient given that knife crime can mean anything . 
  funnily enough , the amount killed with knives in the uk is 200 , whereas it 's 1,694 in the us . 
  interesting how the country with more gun regulation also sees less stabbing deaths to boot . 
  gun regulation leading to rampant knife stabbings is a myth . 
   that ridiculous argument has already been destroyed . 
  try again . 
  funny , you keep on pointing out that it is `` just an inanimate object '' when it 's guns but every other weapon does n't have this apply to them magically . 
   you said `` total gun homicide rate '' . 
  yes . 
  which is measured per 100,000 people . 
   and your doubt here is based on what ? 
  bullets sold in africa work the same as bullets sold in the us . 
  there are plenty of countries with looser regulatory apparatuses than the us . 
   instead i 'll feel free to completely disregard a simplistic chart made by an organization with a clear agenda . 
  [ what a convenient way to ignore facts .

  `` then feel free to confirm whether it is or not . '', 
  `` no , thanks ! '', 
   no , actually most of those are quite new developments . 
  particularly the bits about killing citizens without trial . 
  er , you may want to read up on some history . 
   they have . 
  there are presidential hit lists with american names on them . 
  citizens and children have already been murdered . 
  drones have already begun to fly in american skies . 
  indefinite detention without trial is law . 
  the president crying crocodile tears over the connecticut children has killed ten times as my children himself . 
  tyranny is here , and it will only get worse . 
  how is this the us * attacking * their own populace ? 
  if you want some place to live which is free from any sort of government intrusion then your choice is only somalia . 
   no , you specifically claimed that guns killed innocent bystanders `` often '' . 
  this , given the large number of guns in the us , is clearly not true . 
  iirc the figure for just innocent people being shot in something they were n't involved in was 1100 ~ . 
  even if only this is taken in to account ( and the other 10k + gun homicides are ignored ) the us ' rate is still higher than other developed countries . 
   this conversation is happening because a man in connecticut , an `` outlier '' according to you , killed a bunch of kids . 
  you ca n't try to grab guns because of one `` anecdote '' and ignore the contrary evidence provided by another . 
  translation : we only use examples that work in our favor . 
  examples that work against use are clearly invalid . 
  nice bullshit strawman and projection . 
  i have n't used an anecdote yet . 
  the one basing his arguments around examples is you . 
  stop being such a dishonest cunt . 
   this is not me `` strawmanning gun control by pretending that it claims to stop all gun violence '' . 
  wrong again . 
  you claim that these examples are examples of `` failure '' of gun control . 
  the logical inference is that you think it claims to stop all crime , which is an asinine assumption on your part . 
   they are failures of gun control . 
  gun control was implemented and hundreds of millions of people were stripped of their natural rights . 
  in exchange , their societies got nothing , and spree killers are still able to terrorize them . 
  good job on directly contradicting yourself . 
  above this paragraph you denied that you considered these examples to be failures of gun control . 
   the `` data '' you 've pointed to so far is a vague study of a propaganda group , utterly without substantiation or sourcing . 
  of course , we * all * know about harvard 's bias . 
   then why do countries without legal gun ownership have a higher incidence of knife ** crime ** than the us ? 
  define `` knife crime '' . 
   you 're trying to pin the failings of society and people on an inanimate object . 
  nukes for everyone , then ? 
  i 'd argue that being hateful and homophobic is what destroys the very essence of the human creature . 
   that 's what happens when the population of one country is 1 % of the other . 
  why would the population matter when the homicide rate is per 100,000 people ? 
   and you 're assuming he would n't have . 
  i think my assumption is fair to make . 
  i know , but based on what ? 
  he went around europe and could n't get the ammo . 
  if the us had n't provided it to him it 's highly unlikely that he would 've had anywhere else to go . 
  i doubt he would 've sourced them from , say , an african country . 
   really ? 
  then kindly point me to the criteria used and how each case was classified . 
  it does n't appear on the linked page , which only had a yes/no in the field `` weapons obtained legally ? '',
