  who violated belgian neutrality ? 
  who committed war crimes in belgium and serbia ? 
  who demanded france lower all their defenses and submit to occupation as a condition for not being invaded ?

  i do n't tan , i burn . 
  wait , we updated our spelling ? 
  presumably , they were completely and utterly drunk at the time .

  someone else from shropshire is on the internet !,

  science has clearly gone too far this time . 
  real life hunger games .

  me too , i thought it was `` the dative is to the genitive to be death '' . 
  oh boy ... remembering when to use which case , word order , remembering which word uses which article , and the throaty ` r ' sound . 
  i can roll my r 's off the tongue just fine , but apparently that makes you sound bavarian . 
  worst one that comes to mind would be the [ harrying of the north ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harrying_of_the_north ) .
