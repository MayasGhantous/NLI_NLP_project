  it makes * some * sense for measuring liquids , but what really annoys me is when the recipe calls for a cup of flour or something . 
  why would you measure a solid by volume ?

  i do n't believe the state should have the power to kill people as punishment . 
  not my country , but modena and bologna once went to war because of a wooden bucket .

  rarely do rural jurors see an aurora . 
  i mean what else are you going to do , talk * through * the hot porridge ? 
  that sounds potentially quite painful . 
  still , could be worse - you could 've had an aunt named fanny . 
  even if there * is * enough room to swing a cat , you still probably should n't . 
  it will only end badly , and you 'll have no-one to blame but yourself . 
  oh god , that fucking beep test . 
  i never saw the point of pushing myself for that test , since it did n't matter how well you did . 
  i always waited until two or three people got beeped out , then deliberately went too slow . 
  lovely-jubbly !, 
  the only people who think like that are daily mail and daily express readers , who can be safely ignored as they are certifiable lunatics . 
  most people will just think of it as that place where all the beer and cars come from , or they 'll immediately think of that fawlty towers [ sketch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6lu3xqw0 ) .

  i would like to visit russia one day , when relations are a bit better . 
  i think there was some sort of talk about giving it back during reunification , but i 've no idea how serious those talks were . 
  used to be part of germany , russia took it after ww2 , no-takebacksies rule still in effect . 
  can we have the norwegians instead ? 
  garibaldi owed them a favour iirc , so they asked not to be included in italy . 
  i think it falls under the category of `` not enough there to bother conquering '' . 
  do n't be absurd - how could you possibly gift wrap it ? 
   spanish is the second most spoken language globally , and in the united states . 
  as opposed to english , which is the most widely spoken language both globally and in the us . 
   it 's far easier to learn as a language , than german or french depends what your first language is , surely ? 
  i daresay a dutch speaker would find learning german a lot easier than spanish . 
  english is the current lingua franca thanks to about a century of pax britannia followed by about 60 years of pax americana . 
  spain has n't been a great power for about two centuries by this point , and latin america is n't exactly a global powerhouse - why on earth would the eu suddenly switch to spanish ? 
  french or german i could see , but spanish ? 
  at least ironbridge is nice !, 
  that was written in 1937 , so it 's been a shithole for nearly eighty years now . 
  the best thing about living in telford is that i 'm only 5 minutes drive from the train station , so i can get out as quickly as possible .

  i remember looking on wikipedia and thinking provence-alpes-cote d'azur was a bit of a mouthful . 
  maybe because so few of them travel overseas ? 
  yeah , but what have the romans ever done for us ? 
  it 's because when he unlocked democracy , that caused his willingness to go to war to go to -1 . 
  the devs never thought of this and so never allowed that value to be a negative number . 
  instead of going to -1 , it went all the way around to the max value . 
  the devs thought it was funny and kept it in .

   i like seeing these bits of culture as regards holidays - we go to rainy fields with static caravans , the germans dig holes on the beach , ** and you guys invade france .
