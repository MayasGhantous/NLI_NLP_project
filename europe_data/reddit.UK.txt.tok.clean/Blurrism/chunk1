i do hate the economist . 
  it 's just embarrassing compared to ft. 
  uk checking in . 
  our left is more concerned at how to destroy itself . 
  works out about 28 % that do n't buy what putin said . 
  about representative of the election results . 
  ( the correct answer is the rebels by the way ) . 
  icelandic lorry ? 
  no idea , be fun to see how they manage it though . 
  perhaps an icelandic helicopter . 
  this would be interesting to see how it pans out , especially with asylum to assange . 
  there was one . 
  they voted to remain part of the union . 
  french or the russians . 
  i 'm not sure how either of those situations would come about , but they 're the only other two nations in europe with a comparable military . 
  brexit was a special kind of referendum that was almost unpredictable . 
  yougov have one of the best track records in the business . 
  that question on northern ireland about the love of the union has been a sticking point for a few . . brief history of the united kingdom of gb and ni . 
  great britain was a territory of the romans around 2000 years ago . 
  they did not distinguish anything about regionalism and called it ** britannia ** . 
  the only problem they had was reaching the north due to wars with the north where modern day scotland is . 
  after this , the south were invaded repeatedly by the anglo saxons , and the name anglo became the nickname for the english . 
  in the north , irish tribes invaded scotland and gave them their gaelic roots . 
  the germanic speakers of the anglo saxons referred to the brits as welsh . 
  a lot of these were pushed into the area that is now wales due to invasions . 
  these created some regional differences , but a lot of this went away in 1066 due to another invasion . 
  after this point , all of these cultures mixed and fought and the like . 
  this is how the british language formed due to this mixture . 
  they were separate countries despite being very similar , and wales was annexed by england some 400 years ago . 
  by 1707 the act of the union was passed and the nations were all legally one again . 
  1801 passed and the united kingdom merged with ireland , becoming the united kingdom of great britain ( wales , scotland , england ) and the kingdom of ireland . 
  southern ireland then split from the union as it did not feel like it should be governed in this union , becoming its ** own ** country . 
  the north stayed with the union and has fought for it since . 
  so tl ; dr northern ireland see themselves as british for the most part ( look at ` border poll ' for national opinion on that ) but also consider themselves irish . 
  ** some ** of scotland want independence as it feels it should be its own sovereign state of which it does not have currently . 
  wales exists as it has its own historical differences with the rest of the union , but is not a sovereign nation . 
  this includes languages and politics . 
  ask spain . 
  this . 
  people like to downplay the bbc but it is wonderful most of the time . 
  i think the lack of detail is normally to avoid side taking , although people still think it takes sides . 
  hard to believe just a few years before i was born all these countries were n't independent being trapped in the soviet bubble . 
  happy independence day !, 
  that was the greatest example of a strawman argument i have ever seen . 
  in all fairness , that 's not hard . 
  but i do n't think any media has portrayed an image of what is going on there . 
  or just invaders in general . 
  not as good as the uk though * cough * 1066 / s, 
  in all fairness , he did say this in the early 2000 's after a decade of yeltsin . 
  i think unlike crimea and georgia , the baltics have really kicked on into becoming modern european states ( or at least heading that way ) , so it 'd be suicidal for russia to take over . 
  i do hope i do n't have to eat my words on this . 
  that thing looked awesome on the commercials . 
  i know twas a joke , i do n't actually think they 're ` kicking us while we 're down ' . 
  they 're protecting their own interests , which is why many people voted brexit * sigh *, 
  why you got to do this norway , kicking us while we 're down :(, 
  ahh by that sense , i guess it is pretty big as i do n't know everyone . 
  but then again , i do n't know everyone in my college . . 
  i do know the police though but we only have 6 so it 's not too hard . 
  my town has 67,000 in the uk . 
  it 's not even a big town . 
  in a 300 year old territorial claim , 15 years ago is n't that long ago . 
  and still love . 
  find it so strange how much has changed in just 100 years . 
  while they should n't be offended , it certainly happens on both sides . 
  when russia were stationing their submarines north and were going through the channel , the british press made it sound like we were being attacked . 
  pick your poison ? 
  i think it 's best to have both , a reminder of both points of history and whatever the locals prefer should be kept . 
  i think that 's what they do at the moment , right ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  trump has the best jokes though , does n't he folks ? 
  now that 's pretty cool . 
  some hard negotiations going on here . 
  surprised we were first . 
  was way above 40 in m\u00e1laga at one point last summer . 
  you know it 's bad when boris is the pick of the bunch . 
  the compulsory nature of languages does n't help in the uk either . 
  in our school it was compulsory for 3 years , and then for the extra 2 optional years , only 4 kids out of the 300 or so decided to do another year . 
  it 's a big issue . 
  i 'd disagree , take venezuela as example number 1 . 
  i think people here honestly do forget that russian people are still just people and not this evil mob of 140 million people . 
  i think you should go with mongolians this week though . 
  my father is spanish , and has lived in spain all his life . 
  my mother on the other hand is english , and lived in spain from 1995-98 , and i was born in england in 1999 ( therefore under 18 ) . 
  in the case of brexit , would i be able to gain spanish citizenship , and european passports via my father ? 
  i 'd like this due to the restrictions on free movement i would then face to live with my dad for a few years etc. 
  and is dual citizenship allowed with two passports ? 
  i am extremely concerned about us leaving the eu as i would like to live in and around europe and the leave camp seem to have little answer for this . 
  have you not read the express ? 
  or do you not class that as a rag ? 
  it 's not a foot long ??? 
  * damn you putin * . 
  the double bluff . 
  damn it they got me . 
  i saw a russian gymnast crying on the bbc about the decision , i feel awful for the innocent dragged down in this . 
  no that is with the refund , gross is more like 34bn a year but with everything we get back , including instantly , it 's more like 10 billion net, 
  but the second biggest amount in the union , at a huge deficit at around 10bn net a year that i would consider a ` fee ' , although that money is dwarfed with the trident vote . 
  why should britain be punished for this ? 
  it seems spiteful more than economic , we have n't invaded anyone guys, 
  biased english reported ? 
  do n't be silly !,
