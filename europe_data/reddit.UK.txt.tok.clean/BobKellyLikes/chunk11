  is it weird for a british person to use a union jack as a flair now ? 
  football and crossword puzzles . 
  `` bond , james bond '' i guess . 
  we just spend 6 weeks doing whatever . 
  why do we get excluded in this question ? 
  the union jack is my national flag . 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't follow . 
  dunno about the southerns though ... they have pretty good grub . 
  it would hurt google way more as the entire of the eu would just use their competitors . 
  i totally agree . 
  it sounds like such a cool idea to join together and become a massive country that is * bigger * then the us ( i mean can you imagine ?!, 
  ) , but then i think do i really want to live in a world where the union jack and the french flag are not flown outside the un ? 
  it would essentially mean turning our massive impact on the world , history and culture into that of a us state where we would be known for a tacky niche like `` kentucky was the home of kfc '' or `` florida has alligators '' . 
  i do n't think i 'd ever get that desperate for my country to have influence . 
  when you say ` in the uk ' do you mean the south of england compared to the scottish highlands or the south of england compared to the north of england or something else entirely ? 
  just a bunch of northern monkeys up there with their mills and depression . 
  just use the un divisions as they work and then there is no more bickering between different countries . 
  yeah it 's alright . 
  people go on about it too much though . 
  i do n't care about the next town over from me , * let alone * norwich . 
  being an exception , yes . 
  there was only 30,000 hungarians in london as of 2015 so it might be your 46th biggest city ? 
  where did you get the idea that london has that many hungarians and that hungary has so few large cities ? 
  just ignoring the entire `` uk-england '' thing , obviously we have very good relations with our ex settler colonies which have become very successful and we have close ties with because of the common ancestry , language history etc. 
  our relations with our other colonies is quite good too as we still share a lot of culture as a result of colonialism and a lot of them are our allies and within the commonwealth of nations . 
  i would say our worst relations we have with our colonies are with those from north africa and the middle east . 
  i think from the way he structured his list ( france-quebec , portugal-brazil , uk-england ) he is suggesting that england is a colony of the uk ... stop the oppression !, 
  could n't care less about any of it . 
  there is plenty more to worry about in this county then the road sighs . 
  god you give a guy a centimetre and he takes a kilometre , typical . 
   i like the mentally to stand up always after failing is n't that a way of thinking that is encouraged everywhere though ? 
  i would say that americans are generally more optimistic but they do n't own the trademark on determination . 
  5 days is a holiday . 
   do they taste good - i think so i guess that * seals * the deal . 
  do n't you have news articles written in french or have you all just given up with your language ? 
  [ the fighting temeraire ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/the_fighting_temeraire%2c_jmw_turner%2c_national_gallery.jpg ) is probably the most well known painting from britain and you could say it captures the essence with the country what with an old warship being taken down the river to its last berth . 
  i would n't say that there is 1 conclusive painting that undeniably captures the nation though . 
  buy all the stuff i ever wanted and then some more . 
  spend the 8 months relaxing in a expensive chair in comfort . 
  [ weymouth beach ] ( https://www.visitengland.com/sites/default/files/styles/experience_page_consumer_gallery_image/public/weymouth-dorset-beach-seaside-resort.jpg?itok=hxlhlz7y ) in dorset along the jurassic coast . 
  desperate times call for desperate measures and with our current political climate the political news just takes over and leaves no room for any other type of content . 
  r/casualuk is a great sub but it 's sad that we need a sub with strict rules just so we can talk about normal stuff like tesco and telly . 
  r/unitedkindom is pretty much a big echo chamber , but more importantly it 's just plain boring . 
  every single post is an article about politics in some way or another with almost no exceptions . 
  other national subreddits seem to have a healthy mix of politics , jokes , general discussions and other stuff but our national subreddit is basically just r/ukpolitics 2, 
  1066 worst year of my life . 
  pretty easy . 
  i 'm not left or right but saying that common leftist politics is in the same league as stalin is ridiculous . 
   she wanted to move to america and get a green card you did n't happen to find her in the mail did you ? 
  would n't * you * like yo know, 
  i do n't see how anyone could take this as patriotic . 
  it literally says the head of state is not a human being part of a fascist regime . 
  is it patriotic to be unpatriotic now ? 
  i 'm not a big fan of london 's current cityspace as most of our sky scrapers are all sparsely sprinkled though out the city and they all have strange shapes and designs unlike new york where everything is somewhat uniform and organised . 
  [ like this one . ], 
  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/walkie-talkie_-_sept_2015.jpg ) why did they have to build it like a weird internet router box ? 
  i do like [ the shard ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/the_shard_from_the_sky_garden_2015.jpg ) though and think it 's the best looking modern building in london . 
  do n't ask us go on r/imaginarymaps as they have tons of hypothetical scenarios for the geopolitical landscape of europe and the world . 
  would it be the u.s.e and would we have to chant it out at football games because this is a deal breaker . 
  southern welsh . 
   do you tend to read most books in your native language , most in english ? 
  both i guess . 
  my favorite film from this country and in general is zulu from 1964 with micheal caine in his first standout role . 
  the action is great and the whole the film is just intense as the first third has almost no action and is dedicated to just the threat of the oncoming zulus and then the remaining length of the film depicts the battle from pretty much start to finish . 
  psh and they call * us * the nationalist country . 
  evidently we do n't . 
  oh sorry it 's hard to tell through type . 
  but should n't you be singing jerusalem on st georges day or something since it is the celebration of the patron saint of england specifically and not the rest of the uk ? 
  anyway , i would n't know . 
  eh what ? 
  no , i just did n't go to anything since religion or community is n't important to me or my family . 
  pretty sure most people do n't go to church so this is n't new for you . 
  well i did n't go to scouts or churches . 
  lol no . 
  i 'll start celebrating saint george and going to church when they give me the day off , till then it 's business as usual . 
  i do n't think there is one unique colour for the whole of the uk but i think red was an important colour for england as it was used on our [ banners ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/royal_banner_of_england.svg ) , [ coat of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/royal_arms_of_england_%281198-1340%29.svg ) and [ st cross ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/flag_of_england.svg ) . 
  let them go if they want to , that 's been everyone in my town 's opinion to scottish independence as not too many people are phased . 
  our countries will still obviously be very close so you can still visit if you want and i believe in self determination so that applies to wales and ni too . 
  i would n't allow the balkanisation of england though as if we start splitting up then everything would go to shit . 
   more funds = better education obviously this is true , but public schools ( opposed to just ordinary paid for independent schools ) are so elite that if i attended one i would probably be preparing to become pm of the country and playing polo with old school chums , not talking to some guy on reddit . 
  there is a reason they are called the old boys clubs . 
  also , my education was comprehensive you cheeky little prick and it was to the same standard as every other state school in the country . 
  it does n't matter what material your school chooses to base your english gcse on as an english gcse is an english gcse . 
  but if you say something to them then you have lost your cool as you have reacted to their actions . 
  state obviously . 
  you 're quite unlikely to ever meet a public school kid that it 's not even worth asking that question . 
  btw there is a difference between public and independent if that 's what you meant . 
   passive aggression is not really losing your cool . 
  it is n't ? 
  honestly , if this was me i would just think `` god what an asshole '' and then make a face or tut to my friend to show my disdain and then my friend would probably nod in agreement . 
  you never did of mice and men ? 
  good god man . 
  we looked some of his poems in year 9 and watched the whole of much ado about nothing in year 8 when the teacher was sick for 2 weeks but that is about it . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's not compulsory to learn shakespeare in the uk as we did n't go near the guy . 
  the only unifying piece of literature that i think everyone had to study in the 30 years is of mice and men . 
  it 's a kinda love hate relationship . 
  not being surrounded by an ocean . 
  it was occupied by the italians but it is pretty stretching it to say the italians successfully colonized ethiopia as they only held on to it for 5 years , they had extremely limited control , they never capitalized on it and it took place in the lead up the ww2 so many consider it a pre-war event and not a simple act of imperialism . 
  it 's not british colonialism it 's european colonialism . 
  when i say `` we '' i 'm referring to europeans in general .
