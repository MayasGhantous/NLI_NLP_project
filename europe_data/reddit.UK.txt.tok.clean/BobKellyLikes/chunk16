  then we need to find the great queen-mother of the muslims and kill its eggs before it can hatch any more muhammads and then send back to its pit in the iran . 
  invade the muslim capital of iraq and steal their big black cube thingy and do n't give it back until they stop messing about and sort it out . 
  have you thought about belarus ? 
  but what about sydney ? 
  [ that 's enough of that lads ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu7vysqbgxi ), 
  danke very much . 
  well , europe was the stronghold of christianity so of course we say oh my god and other variants . 
  seems a bit expensive to start in europe before flying 8000 south and then 8000 miles back again to see the netherlands . 
  could n't you just go to france or something ? 
  tip them ?!, 
  they 're lucky if they get a smile and a relatively clean table . 
  so no , do n't tip . 
  besides english speaking stuff , foreign tv is almost non existent ( not including anime obviously ) . 
  one of the unanimously best things about our country is the interesting anglo-saxon/english/british history . 
  i 'm proud of the fact that whatever we were doing throughout history was always * interesting * and usually at the forefront of politics and wars . 
  obviously because we watch sherlock and doctor who on bbc america while listening to dame judi dench 's voice constantly on repeat , oh wait that 's you . 
  definitely yes . 
  pretty sure they do this everywhere , right ? 
  define ` learn ' . 
  if you mean only being able to count to 10 in a language after 3 years of education then we generally learn french . 
  the amount people that would have changed their vote is very overblown . 
  polls conducted after brexit concur that the percentages would n't even move 1 % . 
  i lose power maybe once a year . 
  i think he 's a nice guy but we 're too conservative as a country . 
  you ca n't order double cheese on the bastard things though so you have to use the line !, 
  i [ mean . . ] ( http://westindiacommittee.org/caribbeansgreatwar/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/british_empire_1921.png ) at least you [ tried ? ], 
  your liberals are our conservatives . 
  god , the day you have to start explaining sly remarks . 
  nope , where would i even go ? 
  it was n't serious dude , calm down . 
  you 're 1 step away from being the north korea flag flair guy ... 
  if you have nothing to hide ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  it 's also the second biggest polish city . 
  do n't really know/care much about it . 
  morning afternoon evening night do you even * need * any more ? 
  pretty decent . 
  pay # 15 ( a month ) for 18 gb of 4g and unlimited texts/calls which covers a lot of where i live . 
   whitewashing bad parts of our history what are talking about ? 
  we 're the nicest guys , we never hurt anyone and everyone is our friend . 
  heard the ex-soviets states are quite nice this time of year ... 
  does cornwall count ? 
  it 's kinda of nation-ish and slightly different . 
  other then that i got nothing . 
   everyone in europe is more progressive than us , and agrees diversity , inclusiveness , and multiculturalism is the foundation for a strong modern society . 
  since when do we all agree on that ? 
  i 'd say it 's the the most polarizing argument of the century . 
  i would n't look up to us ... 
  gee i dunno , house of cards ? 
  i use it as a flair on reddit and select it when a program asks for my language but that 's about it . 
  i watched das boot half way through if that counts . 
  well greeks are europeans and the irish guy is half european so ... 
  and what do you in america consider white ? 
  then what 's the point in asking if we 've had any * people of colour * leaders if you discredit any native people that ( to your stranded ) are of * colour * ? 
  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/handshake_2016-07-14_%2828303482095%29_%28cropped%29.jpg ) would your american race identifier consider the [ president of greece ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/files/pavlopoulos2.jpg ) to be a `` person of colour '' ? 
  because if so we had our first poc leader 1000 's of years ago . 
  just the [ contemporary definition ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39europe_polar_stereographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg ) so i 'd say russia ( or maybe kazakhstan ) . 
  just speak english and you should be alright . 
  being in the same continent . 
  i was thinking the name sounded cooler but whatevs . 
  all . 
  it was better as persia . 
  nato is the u.s ' baby and without the u.s there is not much reason for its existence . 
  we will have 2 aircraft carriers by 2020 which we desperately needed for a country that supposedly meant to have a world class navy . 
  all roads lead to london ... 
  yikes that 's weird . 
  give me deference and outdated conservative views on sex any day . 
  children should n't be taught about sex we should just assume they know by the age of 10 , way easier . 
  i ca n't wrap my feeble anglo mind around it . 
  coerced is also the wrong word . 
  if anything , england was coerced because the reason they agreed to the acts of union was to prevent scotland from allying with france and the threat of war . 
  i 'm just gunna post the definition of a country of wikipedia instead explaining the word country to you . 
  a country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography . 
  a country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state , as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division , or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics . 
  no it 's a country that is n't sovereign . 
  since we 're all speaking the english language you do n't get to define what a country is and is n't . 
  their initial willingness to join is ** not ** debatable . 
  they joined willingly at the time , the end . 
  yes the union was extremely unpopular with the common people in both countries however their opinion did not matter because it was 1707 . 
  lombardy is of relevance, 
  irish, 
  also , '' never really given a choice '' ? 
  they joined the uk willingly , had a referendum in 2014 and now are planning to have another !, 
  if by `` oversimplify it '' you mean wrong . 
  [ just scroll though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_europe ) if you have a minute . 
  scotland was not conquered . 
  the scottish and english parliament both passed the acts of union in 1707 to form the kingdom of great britain on which only the kingdoms of scotland and england were represented on the union flag . 
  scotland wanted to recuperate from the failure of the darien scheme while england wanted to ensure that england and scotland shared the same monarch in case of scotland allying against her . 
  the union of england and scotland at the time was a somewhat of a union of equals as even though england was more dominant it was not to the same degree that we see today with the population of england to scotland being 5 million - 1 million instead of 53 million - 5 million . 
  damn you guys start young . 
  we never even officially had sex education . 
  we did n't have drama so i 'm not sure what you would do there . 
  i 'm not sure about catalonia but scotland and the rest of the countries of the united kingdom are indubitably countries in their own right and the thought that we are one nation but different people have continued to this day while germany and italy had big pan-nationalism movements in their development to unite their countries and their people . 
  wait , why do you teach children about traffic rules , gender roles and relationships in history ( if at all ) ? 
  basic school history glosses over a lot of stuff but that 's understandable considering not all of it is completely essential . 
  my mandatory education in history from year 3 ( aged 7 ) to year 8 ( aged 13 ) was : + some famous british events and people like the fire of london or florence nightingale - year 3 . 
  + basic family friendly history e.g ancient egyptians , vikings , anglo-saxons and romans . 
  - year 4 . 
  + civil war , protestant reformation and the war of the roses - year 5 . 
  ( oh and robin hood for some reason ) . 
  + history on ww2 but focusing on the blitz and the war at home ( rationing , songs , evacuation ) then the actual war and the holocaust - year 6 .
