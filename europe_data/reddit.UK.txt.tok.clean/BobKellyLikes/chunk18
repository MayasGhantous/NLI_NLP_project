  because nationality is n't something you can just make up on a whim and most people would consider you seriously fucked up if you had essentially lied to them by claiming you 're from a certain place that you have no relation to because you `` feel '' like you are . 
  i 'm glad you 're not the ones handing out the passports mate . 
  welsh accents on women are lovely . 
  what if i was born in ireland but was never raised there ? 
  or if i was born to irish parents/parent and grew up elsewhere ? 
  or if i simply migrated to ireland at the age of 52 ? 
  this seems like a bit of a ridiculous mindset to say your nationality can be whatever you want it to be regardless of your ethnicity , place of birth , language , culture and where you 're living/or have lived . 
  i ca n't go around saying i 'm czech if i have absolutely no connection to the czech republic , cant speak the language and have never set foot there , can i ? 
   what are your thoughts on children of parents with different nationality ? 
  not much really . 
  normally the children are whatever country they grew up in the most unless they have a connection to both places equally , then they 're probably feel like a mix of both . 
  example being : if you 're born to english parents in england you 're probably going to consider yourself english but if you 're born to a scot and a welshwoman and grew up in england you 're more likely to identify as general british or say your half welsh/scot etc. 
  dire and shitty . 
  as britain is one of the big powers in europe but with less then half of the land of france , houses are very small compared to other countries and some of the most constantly expensive . 
  overpopulation and a lack of housing will be a major problems in britain in the future as more and more of our already small countryside and nature is eaten up by urban areas . 
  still could be worse , could be stabbed . 
  i 'm british so i do n't want to learn another language , like * ever * . 
  yeah , but a true magician gets away with it . 
  fuck portugal ( because treaty of windsor ) , mary wales ( because stockholm syndrome ) , kill france ( obviously ) , kill scotland ( they need to go too ) , kill germany as well , kill all the irish , kill the aborigines , kill the spaniards , kill the native americans , ** kill the colonists , kill the indians ** , ** kill the africans ** , ** just kill them all !, 
  ** * clears throat, 
   letting a wildly unpopular coal lover cook the atmosphere . 
  as long as the us economy keeps going no one will try and stop you . 
  kinda the curse of being the most powerful country in the world as only america can stop america . 
  why should europe jeopardise the world economy because your election process sucks ? 
  amazing . 
  the problems of the the middle east are solved , let peace rule in our time . 
  the sun might make an appearance . 
  some people propose that the prince flag be used if flanders ever rejoined the netherlands to form the uk of the netherlands , would you agree with the flag change under those circumstances ? 
  our flag was tainted by 300 years of colonialism and wars so do n't let it phase you , it 's hardly the swastika . 
  r/vexillology would love you forever if it happened . 
  a harp flag would be pretty cool though right ? 
  be the only country in the world with a musical instrument for a fleg . 
  maybe make the st patrick 's cross symmetrical because the white colour of st andrew 's is the same as the border so it looks way bigger and ruins the balance . 
  other than that i have no quarrels with the union jack . 
  maybe change the boring crosses of england and scotland to their [ royal ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/royal_banner_of_england.svg ) [ banners ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/royal_banner_of_scotland.svg ) to match with [ wales ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/flag_of_wales_2.svg ) ? 
  as does cockney and a few other dialects . 
   for using correct oxford spelling ? 
  psh , so uncivilised . 
  the most consistent types would be the british vlogging parasites like `` new flat tour !! '', 
  and `` off limit real q and a !!! '' . 
  also , those annoying carpool karaoke videos from mr green light james corden get on trending but i 'm not sure if that counts . 
   correct  french choose one . 
   uncivilized someone put me down . 
  * so uncivilized ( throws blaster on the floor ) * ... 
  why do american 's pronounce herbs as `` erbs '' ? 
  i thought that the american form of english was created to smooth the language out so it made more sense in its spelling and such , but pronouncing it `` erbs '' it just backwards because it sounds like something you would find in british english because it makes no sense . 
  beatles , obviously . 
  i guess someone 's got ta do it . 
  let the u.s be the policemen of the world and keep the budget at 1 % of gdp . 
  morris dancing is not the traditional clothing , they 're just a bunch of middle aged men with nothing better to do . 
  england does n't have traditional clothing or a national dress as it separates us from the riff raff . 
  a very interesting question that you have proposed indeed . 
  in the english language ( at least the variety spoken in the sovereign nation of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ) there are a multiple amount of charming colloquial phrases , slayings and slag that is used to refer to the currency of british sterling pound which has made itself part of the mere fabric of the nation . 
  one of the most common words that is used is `` money '' as it is very useful and convenient because everyone understands it ( because it is a word ) . 
  many scholars have universally agreed that `` quid '' may be a rising star in the british slang collection and that it may even see popular use as early as 2050 ; another truly inspiring tale of quirky language that calls these fair isles their home . 
  there are no more known words that refer to `` money '' in modern times as they have all sadly died out millennia ago so the interesting tale of british words that refer to `` money '' in our language or dialect , ends here . 
  [ tl : dr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=texatquvqac ), 
  i would guess r/unitedkingdom would react with utter contempt , anyway they 're too busy constantly arguing about politics to notice . 
  they live in somalia ? 
  i do n't consider small talk `` bad '' , its just a part of life and it 's just pleasant to say good morning or say something about the weather to someone instead of ignoring them . 
  maybe it 's an english speaking thing , but then again people in the big cities of the uk are known for being blunt and rude compared to the rest of the country . 
  nationalism as an idea comes in many different styles and varieties that are n't all responsible for the tragedies of the past . 
  umm i thought european federalists wanted european nationalism for the common people to consider a european identify ? 
  why should european nationalism and nationalism in general be something that must be avoided ? 
  no not really , london is in a bubble compared to the rest of the uk which is only natural when you remember that it has a higher population then scotland and wales combined and a gdp higher then sweden . 
  if nigel has bad teeth by your standards then i 'm fucked . 
  i thing the biggest stereotype ( bigger then tea and such ) is the general `` british stereotype '' that is common with anglophiles and most tourists . 
  it is the idea that the uk is just england and that england is just london which leads to london essentially * becoming * the british identity to most people overboard . 
  we have tesco and piss-heads , come along !, 
  british imperial is still widely used in everyday life and to this day i could n't tell you how tall i am or how much i weigh in metric . 
  because they 're all different countries ?!, 
  people need to stop asking questions like this , just because we 're in a union does n't mean we need to have matching everything . 
  bbc ( most reputable ) , times and the guardian ( to a lessor degree ) and sometimes telegraph and sometimes independent . 
  misleading if you ask me . 
  well yes i did only read the title as the description is usually only background information or evidence to back up the question . 
  rule of thumb : put a clear question in the title . 
   why they are n't actively trying to stop migration to the union in the first place . 
  i dunno , because it does n't really affect them ? 
  i was answering the original question . 
  because they do n't want all the problems that comes with redistributing migrants from mena , they do n't have economies as strong as weston european countries , they do n't have the need for thousands of skill/unskilled workers , they do n't wa n't to lose their relative ethnic homogeneous populations , etc etc etc. 
  what 's the point ? 
  if you move them to poland they will just got back to germany or sweden . 
  a european army would only exist if ultimate federalization was met as having a joint military force is the last thing on the list for a political unions of countries as you 're giving up your defense . 
  also , a proud soldier in a national army is n't going to want to fight to protect the entirety of europe and they would n't want their individual armies and practices to be absorbed either . 
  i 'm completely against a united army unless europe literally becomes a single country . 
  there are no self service station or tables its just have your chips plain or fucked . 
  where have you been living ? 
  [ so basically um , what i was thinking was um ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkbu8b-qvzk ), 
  tbh not much as much as i should . 
  i know they used to be in yugoslavia and they were the last country to fly the nest and become independent . 
  they have a flag similar to albania with the double headed eagle and it 's a bitch to draw . 
  i probably will before i die because loophole . 
  iv ' e adapted to never have salt or vinegar because the chippies always fuck it up . 
  it was and debatably * is * still a crisis , hence the name `` migrant crisis '' . 
  we have a lot of irish and its hard to tell whose irish and whose not after all the interbreeding over the centuries , oh god we 're like rabbits . 
  no this is pretty shitty map to say the least . 
  it does n't include russia ( which is definitely european ) , east thrace or any of the countries in the caucasus region which some people consider part of europe ( especially the more culturally european ones like georgia ) . 
  probably none ? 
  good luck in the land of the free or whatever . 
  what so wrong with the us that you 're so desperate to escape to europe with no plans and worthless degrees ?
