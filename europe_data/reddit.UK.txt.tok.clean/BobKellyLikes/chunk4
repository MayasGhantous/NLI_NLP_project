  france is difficult to describe and harder still as i 've never actually met anyone from there either . 
  from what i do know , i would say they have very good cuisine and their language is nice , to an extent . 
  you do n't watch game of thrones ?

  the us would n't just have to protect it 's own forces , but would have to deal with the insane logistics of waging complete total war against an enemy 3000 miles away , that has double the population , about the same size of land as the us , is highly advanced technologically , could match the us militarily ( after the war engines get turning ) and has the home and defending advantage . 
  sounds insane to me . 
  umm they make up half our population so i 'm grateful they 're there , i guess ? 
  well i doubt the us could conquer europe with having to fight a war against a highly advanced enemy , across thousands of miles , with no launching pad and with half the population . 
  but on the same hand , a united europe could n't conquer the us . 
  well sadly that is what happens . 
  if germany and the uk went to war again * today * , you could bet your arse we 'd be bombing the shit out of each others cities before too long . 
  it seems pointless to consider the bombing of enemy cities and civilians war crimes when it is considered a part of warfare and would happen again and again whenever a war breaks out . 
  it was total war and all that seems to go out the window . 
   not before the area bombing directive . 
  the fact that americans and brits considered it the point does n't make it right , does it now ? 
  i 'd say yes . 
   and i am sure you do n't believe the blitz was a legitimate act of warfare ? 
  it was a legitimate act of warfare , as was the allied bombing of dresden and hamburg . 
   because in all the cases i mentioned civilians were deliberately targeted and killed . 
  uhh yeah . . that 's kinda the point and outcome of a bombing raid . 
  i hardly think the germans were aiming at fields all night during the blitz, 
  i would hardly say any of us are homogenous in anyway besides that fact that we all traditionally have similar skin tones . 
  most nations and people groups seem to be pretty well defined on the continent and not a `` eurofaggish mass '' . 
  sounds like a load of bollocks to me . 
  i do n't `` feel '' or want to be british , i just am . 
  i am european by definition as i was born in this continent , but i do n't feel or seem to be apart of anything . 
  if we had to adopt the euro and everything else like your modern-day newcomer , then we 'd have likely never joined in the first place . 
   that just tainted their attitude towards a more british identity , instead of an european identify . 
  well funny enough we * are * actually british , so it can hardly be helped . 
   generally the new world has people who are less backward than africans or asians and you 're suppose to be left wing ? 
   and so many terrorists have been the sons and daughters of skilled immigrants or skilled immigrants themselves ; 9/11 was orchestrated by an architect for instance , so skills are n't a vaccine against violent extremism like the center right makes them out to be you talk so much but basically end up saying nothing and making no sense .
