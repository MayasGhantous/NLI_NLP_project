  you just randomly start talking about terrorism in repose to skilled immigrants when there was literally no previous discourse even mentioning it . 
  do n't reply to this , i cant be bothered to even try and decipher what you 're trying to say . 
  have n't we already done this ? 
  [ you made a post a while ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6pidzf/has_your_political_opinion_changed_much_over_the/dkppg91/?context=3 ) that you 'd want to non-violently harass and nationalists and that countries wanting higher skilled immigrants is wrong because we should help * everyone * . 
  and now you 're saying shit like :  should take in the neediest who are willing to assimilate rather than the skilled , europe should try to take in millions of poor blacks in the ** western hemisphere ** , sole purpose of nations and nationalism should be to protect endangered languages , , the us and turkey should be sanctioned to all hell until they elect benign leaders , yeah , you 're views are pretty out there dude . 
  also , we should take in `` poor blacks '' from the western hemisphere ? 
  so like america ? 
  you want us to start taking in african americans that live in the usa ? 
   is n't going from one country within the uk to another considered going abroad ? 
  ha , no . 
  everything is exactly the same except wales has some funny looking signs . 
  driving west for an hour does n't really count as `` going abroad '' . 
  we 're part of the same state for god 's sake and i even have some obscure relatives from there who pop down every now and then . 
  if they call a cuppa `` builders tea '' . 
  no , it 's just regular tea you snob . 
  ah well . 
  ca n't miss what you never had !, 
  i know right ? 
  me and my family just went camping in cornwall every year for 6 years from 2002 to 2008 when i was growing up . 
  then after a 4 year hiatus , we went back there in 2012 and 2014 , went to wales in 2013 and my last holiday was to yorkshire in 2015 . 
  but then there are people here who have been to over 30 countries and i 'm just sat here having never left my own . 
  none, 
  the weather is fine . 
  the amount of rain is average and the rest of the time it 's cool and cloudy . 
  it depends on what you definition of good weather is . 
  to an * italian * maybe , but most people here at the least have a mutual understanding of the weather and certainly do n't go around e-begging for karma by making shit quips for americans . 
  i 've been assured that it was pretty great . 
  the country ( just england ) obviously when wild when it happened and people still go on about it today and write songs about it and shit . 
  we 're probably never going to live up to it again but it 's good it happened . 
   brits milk it too for upvotes and attention from americans too fucking right . 
  people like the cunts on [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/6q31wz/legend_says_that_king_arthur_will_return_when_the/ ) deserve to be taken out and shot for god damn treason . 
  `` we love queuing , tea and it always rains xddxdxd '' . 
  fucking state of that . 
  no , the english flag is not an alternative to the union jack . 
  for the uk i 'd say no , but [ us ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/royal_banner_of_england.svg ) and the [ scottish ] ( http://kilt.com.ua/images/news/scotland11_2.png ) both sometimes use our royal banners as alternatives and welsh people sometimes use their [ saint cross . ], 
  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/flag_of_saint_david.svg ), 
  and if my aunt had balls , she 'd be my uncle . 
  i always wonder what happens in the generations to come when the immigrants adjust to the living standards and have lower birth rates too ? 
  trying to maintain high birth rates and population growth feels like wack-a-mole to me . 
  tainted love by the soft cell , come on eileen by dexys midnight runners and i 'm too sexy would probably be the biggest i can think of . 
   we just do n't have the ** stereotype ** of having attractive people . 
  it 's exactly that . 
  a stereotype . 
  so yeah , we have attractive people . 
  how would you decide ? 
  germany is divided into 16 , quite large federal states while ireland is made of made of many small counties and is a unitary state . 
  how could you make them equal in anyway ? 
  divide ireland into 1 or 2 states and just slice apart countries with a ruler on a map ? 
  it would be difficult to work that way . 
  [ i was being literal . ], 
  if you have a thing for bridges , i guess . 
  your country ? 
  if they generally believed that they 'd be considered pretty weird . 
  historically , a lot of wars have been fought to get the monarchy to it 's current position so we 're not going to toss it all away . 
  statistically no , but there could always be events going on without our knowing about them . 
  in general though i 'd say we 're okay . 
  basically the ones with the best coat of arms or symbols . 
  probably ed sheeran currently . 
  it changes all the time though as we 're self reliant when it comes to pop stars and the music industry this country . 
  i do n't know enough or care enough about politics to really know , but i bet it 'll be someone i 've never heard of or never thought would be pm . 
  despite all the shit it gets it 's still a pretty cool country . 
  i always thought it was because they wanted to fulfill their little prophecy of owning both sides of the straits of gibraltar . 
   the day anglophones are actually good at foreign languages then we can talk about how uneducated someone who ca n't speak english is . 
  a bit touchy on that subject are we ? 
  * shrug *, 
  you do you think that will hurt ? 
  i 'm sick of people assuming we want to devastate our own economies just to punish the us because trump was elected or because of iraq or global warming stuff . 
  a lot of eu countries are already suffering from the sanctions against russia let alone what sanctioning the us would do . 
  do n't look to the other nations of the world to stop the us , we 'd rather not rock the boat . 
   i downvote for really stupid reasoning i like my taps . 
  i like them because they suit my needs in various ways . 
  that 's not stupid reasoning , that 's called having a different opinion . 
  even if it was a stupid opinion , where you draw the line is totally subjective . 
  people like you just use the downvote button wrongly i 'm afraid . 
   in winter cold is fucking cold though . 
  tepid is much more comfortable when washing your hands . 
  most people are happy enough washing their hands with cold water , builds character . 
   tepid water there is not much need for it . 
  cold for drinking or washing hands and hot for filling a hot water jug , maybe ? 
  honestly , i have barely used the hot tap . 
  i think having separate taps cuts out the fuss of having to find either hot or cold with a stupid twisting mechanism . 
  too much complication for my life . 
  give me 2 taps labeled h and c any day . 
  edit : jesus sorry for liking different taps to you guys . 
  that 's called a solution friend . 
  their languages can not into lingua franca . 
  if europe is n't exactly a continent then neither is africa as it is only separated by a man man made canal . 
  oh and i guess north and south america would have to be one continent too . 
  great , now we have two mega continents . 
  i do n't like the idea of that . 
  if the nazis were around that long , they might have figured out we 're not really aryran and killed us too !, 
  reagan smash !, 
  reagan smash !, 
   why intermarium federation when all we need is a jagiellon !, 
   god damn brexit making me a hypocrite here ... 
  i did n't vote for it !, 
  fuck the old people in everyone 's countries for their political beliefs . 
  fuck the countryside people in everyone 's countries for their political beliefs . 
  fuck the religious people in everyone 's countries for their political beliefs . 
  where the hell did that come from ?
