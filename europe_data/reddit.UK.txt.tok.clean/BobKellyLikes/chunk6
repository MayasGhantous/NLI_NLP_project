   i went off topic and included stuff that is n't directly related to germany , ** but i do think that a repeat of the holocaust is a very possible outcome ** with cherry picking sources like that , i 'm not surprised by your over the top views . 
  yes , undeveloped e.g. 
  poverty . 
  there are almost no jobs in cornwall , all young people move away as some as they can , houses are being bought up on mass by people from urban areas and there is almost no industry there bar tourism . 
  cornwall and parts of wales are some of the most underdeveloped areas of the uk . 
  even ni has bounced back since the troubles but not these two regions . 
  hey if that 's how you guys like to do it then it 's no problem , but you have to admit it completely contrasts the clear clean cut borders of our constituent countries . 
   finally castille is split because one castille would make no sense . 
  first it does n't really have defined borders if i were in charge of the regions of spain , i would hire historical experts to * make * the defined borders and formally set the official definitions of the regions . 
  monmouthshire was n't officially a part of wales until 1972 and up until that point its identify was vague . 
  maybe we put more importance on our regional nationalities then you guys but i 'm pretty sure it could n't hurt if you guys defined yours a bit more . 
   but instead of maintaning each original kingdom as such , they just converted them into regions , but the origin is the same . 
  i would say that maintaining traditional borders and regions is definitely the way to go when governing multi ethnic states . 
  it keeps regional identities alive and is very important in embracing the idea that the state is a union of different nations and not one nation occupying the others e.g russia . 
  currently in spain , castile is split into 3 regions , leon is n't an independent region , the greater basque region is a mess of states . 
  i believe that if the uk was run in the same manner as spain , we would have separated years ago . 
  i 'm not too sure about the whole thing . 
  i believe in self determination an all , but i worry about the effects of the essential dissolution of spain after hundreds of years . 
  also bigger problems as the basque and catalan regions traditionally extend past the french-spanish border which could cause some extra problems . 
  this would not be good for a lot of other euro countries that have large native minorities as it could strip europe apart back to some holy roman empire shit . 
  so i guess i think the status quo is safer . 
  1/4 of the world and not really . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4as0e4de-ri ), 
  geographic entity . 
  if our country simply became `` the island state , famous for it 's fish and roast-beef ! '', 
  after thousands of years of history , i would really would not want to live on this planet anymore . 
   everyone should accept that turkey is the strongest country of europe now and erdogan did it . 
  europeans are getting angry because they fear if we can get strong again . 
  but we did , guys !, 
  we did !, 
  our new capital will be rome in next 10 years and we will convert pope . 
  it truly is . 
  but if countries exist , so will inherent rights . 
  you ca n't have a united humanity that works to progress the species * and * states that separate us and only exist to serve it 's own citizens . 
  the two cancel each other out . 
  your logic has quite a few flaws . 
   and i think that countries have no inherent rights ... they are groups of humans , and if they want to hog the money , healthcare , and education that 's detestable and should be protested by any nonviolent means that is an extremely fringe view and is bordering on `` world citizen '' type shit . 
  countries exist and humanity is not at the level to function that way currently . 
  how is anyone suppose to have a discussion about politics with you if you essentially do n't think countries should exist and think that a government looking out for it 's own citizens is `` detestable '' ? 
  to answer your earlier question , politically you would not fit in and you would not have any place at a political discussion about the welfare of the country . 
   it 's my belief that the role of politics is to remove suffering from the world okay  most people could , if they really wanted , adopt british and even say yorkshire customs and become somewhat of a yorkshireman sure  the current system is just the rich protecting each other and continuing the unjust lottery of birth so you think a country wanting higher skills in immigrants ( for more moniez and jobz ) is the rich protecting each other ? 
  also , `` unjust lottery of birth '' , sounds pretty out there . 
  birth is n't random or unjust . 
   mild ethnic nationalism based on culture is less classist than the current system based on attracting more rich people . 
  that would make sense if ethnic nationalism could be based on culture . 
  which it ca n't . 
  because it 's ** ethnic ** nationalism for god 's sake !, 
   i 'm fine with culturally based limits on immigration but hard numerical or skill walls that one ca n't assimilate across end up creating suffering so you 're basically fine with ethnic nationalism but not okay with having skill levels for immigration ? 
  that 's a pretty weird stance . 
   i now support policies that you 'd likely find center left  regulation of nationalism , and ** nonviolent sabotage or harassment ** against those who choose to harm the environment or take healthcare away that does n't sound very centre left to me ... also  downgrading diplomatic relations with the us and other countries that do n't have a fully representative democracy , you mean the vast majority ? 
  there is no sin in itself , but it 's annoying when americans take it one step further and start going around saying `` i 've got x blood running through my veins '' , like that makes you that ethnicity . 
  + do n't use it for cliche bragging rights ( kilts , lederhosen , kiss me i 'm irish ) . 
  + do n't go around europe `` saying i 'm x ethnicity too ! '', 
  you 're x american . 
  + do n't get too swept away with it , it 's not * that * important . 
  being english/irish/german / french etc , is as common as mud in european diasporas so do n't get too full of yourself . 
  my dad would always says to not trust germans as he always thought they were the scheming types . 
  pretty sure he adopted his views from his dad who was never a big germanophile for obvious reasons . 
  also , whenever a strike or conflict happens in france or in french speaking quebec , a few people will always say `` typical bloody french '' , or something among those lines . 
  i would say that the stereotype that french people are arrogant or indifferent is still very much alive . 
  [ definitely this . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlhmxfgqhis ), 
  i do n't really go on r/europe much . 
  sometimes it can have a very fun and lighthearted feel for a while but then it always goes hardcore into politics when anything happens with threads that have 5000 + comments , not fun . 
  also , the sub has a habit of having an axis of evil of countries that get shit on for a month , so i guess it 's poland 's turn this time . 
   a very short sentence yet still so full of ignorance and uneducatedness that i do n't think i should even begin to formulate a response . 
  here are some thoughts nonetheless true hero . 
  thank you for responding to his `` uneducatedness '' . 
  you are such a trooper . 
  ( in the non propaganda sense though ), 
   fight in ww2 so what ? 
  we fought in ww2 as well and played a massive role in the liberation of europe from fascism , but you do n't see us using it as a reason to shake a tin can to the rest of europe . 
  our sacrifice is hardly remembered nowadays , as it should be , because it was 70 years ago and the the past is the past . 
  stop bringing it up for god 's sake . 
   i mean `` you '' as a collective , for european . 
  so you admit to generalising all europeans in a question ? 
  yeah , i think we 're done here . 
   except for ww2 , but ok . what did they do exactly ? 
   so why do you hold all refugee responsible when not all of them do bad things ? 
  lol i do n't . 
  stop putting words in my mouth . 
  the best vojvodina could hope for would be having the hungarian border being pushed a little bit further down . 
  other then that , i 'd say it has no chance . 
  it 'll take decades or a whole generation . 
   liberated by the proud men of christianity latin america ? 
   i am not saying you must be responsible . 
  i am just saying we can read about history and learn from it . 
  others helped us in the past , why should we not help others now ? 
  there has almost never been a time where syria or mena countries assisted us in the past in any noticeable way so we can pretty much forget the history . 
   so because someone is foreign , they deserve to be attacked ? 
  so some of them give bad reputation to others , does that make it ok to attack them ? 
  there are many groups of people with bad reputations , that does n't mean you should attack them . 
  i did n't say they deserved to be attacked . 
  i simply listed some common reasons . 
   i do n't want to open this rabbid hole , but considering what gb did in middle-east , you ca n't deny they play a role in how the situation turn out today . 
  so they have some direct blame as well . 
  blah blah , sins of the fathers , blah blah , sons not responsible , etc. 
   no british people escaped to north-america during ww2 ? 
  some might of , but the vast majority ( including my ancestors ) did n't . 
  it is n't relevant either way .
