  a crisis happens , the city gets attacked by the eu . 
  i 'm sure this has happened before ? 
  no cancellation of warships then ? 
  hold on , the article is about the uk being `` drastically underrepresented '' in the ec . 
  if you want a partner , then play fair . 
  http://imgur.com/xb8srhz i 'm getting it too ... 
  business as usual , then . 
  i wonder if there 'll be * any * reform under juncker, 
  misleading title , surely ? 
  `` despite eurocrisis , * some * europeans still trust european more than national institutions '' ... would be more accurate no ? 
  so many arrows ... 
  bbc do these self congratulation articles regularly , and then someone feels like the europe reddit should know about it . 
  i do n't like it personally . 
  it 's low compared the three european countries that are n't in the eu28 and have data available for comparison , yes . 
  what you 've just said basically puts the eu 28 in the middle of the bunch . 
  so , agricultural production is * fairly * highly subsidized in europe as a whole , it 'd be nice to see the breakdown by eu countries . 
  it was just something i wanted to point out when the parent poster said the `` vast majority '' of the european electorate is in favour of federalism . 
  my point was that the `` vast majority '' did n't vote , less people know who juncker is , and even less people realised that a vote for an epp supporting party would result in juncker becoming elected * and * only 382 out of 800 epp delegates even supported juncker in the first place . 
  the vast majority of the european electorate did n't vote . 
  so you do n't know what the electorate want . 
  i 'm actually surprised at the uk . 
  especially when you see the tabloids laying into the nhs cuts , long waiting times , and countless other scandals ( just try to google `` colchester hospital scandal '' ) . 
  then again , thanks to the cuts the nhs has been forced to make efficiency savings , and perhaps that 's affected the * efficacy * of the treatments available because practises have been reviewed . 
  for example , back in the day if you broke your leg , you 'd get a plaster cast on it and a pair of crutches ; literally the cheapest treatment available . 
  but these days they 'll give you one of those space boots - relatively expensive but once you 've got that on * you 're not gon na bother them again * , so actually in that case it 's worth it . 
  another example , i broke my collarbone in france , and i bought ( at about 50eur i think ) a sort of harness thing . 
  when i got back to the uk the doc basically confiscated it and gave me a much cheaper looking ( and free to me ) sling which he said latest evidence had confirmed to be slightly more effective . 
  i 'm sure there 's other studues which say the uk is shit - i 've always viewed the nordic countries as having the best healthcare ... 
  yes !, 
  my bad . 
  was there something called flying doctors as well ? 
  most australians i 've met say that about themselves . . 
  unfortunately in the uk the only tv export from australia is about a white man blacking-up and pretending he 's a foreign kid in a secondary school ... maybe that 's not helping things . 
   public pressure and participation is the key factor to democratising the eu . 
  public pressure and participation and * accountability * . 
  neither option you 've presented has the latter . 
  at present , your first option is probably the more democratic because at least the electorate recognise their national leader compared to something like 8 % even knowing who juncker is . 
   eu can finally become more transparent and democratic not when meps vote for the president by secret ballot . 
  how can you hold your mep to account when you do n't know how he/she voted ? 
  until that changes then option 1 is n't the democratic and transparent choice you are suggesting it is . 
  surely the clearest sign for more eu integration would have been to ratify the new treaty through a referendum ? 
  as another poster pointed out - [ the eu 's new treaty is the same as the rejected constitution - only the format has been changed to avoid referendums , says valery giscard d'estaing , architect of the constitution . 
  ] ( http://euobserver.com/institutional/25052 ), 
   which is exactly why we should support a trend toward more democracy when it is possible . 
  i 'm not sure that the current system is that . 
  remember that your elected mep votes in a secret ballot to decide their preferred candidate . 
  how can you hold your elected representative to account when you do n't know if they did what they said they would do ? 
  that the lisbon treaty was not ratified by the people of france , that the previous one was rejected ... 
  i 'm not certain that changes the perception of a democratic deficit . 
  thanks for the correction - but i do n't think it makes a difference to the main thrust of the argument . 
  that [ `` the majority of the institutional and policy reforms envisaged in the constitution are included in the treaty of lisbon , but presented in a different form . '', 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/treaties/lisbon_treaty/ai0033_en.htm ) changes perceptions much i 'm not so sure . 
   in function , very few people had issue with the ` meat ' of the constitution treaty , the issues were rather with it 's form you 'll never know that because it never went to referendum , in france at least . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_european_constitution_referendum,_2005 people voted no , happened later on anyway . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  the treaties are ambiguous about exactly how the next commission president should be selected , but the lisbon treaty states that eu leaders must for the first time take `` into account '' the result of the european elections when proposing the new european commission president . 
   i value living in a democracy how did you feel when france democratically rejected the lisbon treaty but it happened anyway ? 
  besides , the lisbon treaty says that eu leaders must for the first time take `` into account '' the result of the european elections when proposing the new european commission president . 
  that leaves it open to interpretation , especially when there was yet again low voter turnout and i believe something like only 8 % of the electorate actually know who juncker is . 
  taking that into account i 'd say that he 's on weak ground from a democratic point of view . 
  eu is still suffering from a democratic deficit . 
  it 's my understanding that the lisbon treaty states that eu leaders must for the first time take `` into account '' the result of the european elections when proposing the new european commission president . 
  `` into account '' - that 's it . 
  i 'm sure all the leaders have thought long and hard about the result and then will do whatever the hell they want to . 
  all this is is player-hating . 
  if you do n't like it , push for eu reform . 
  this may well be a good example of how the uk seems to over-judiciously `` gold plate '' eu directive into british law, 
  from the article :  the european commission said yesterday that the publication of exit polls posed no problem , but warned against announcing official results until 23.00 pm on sunday . 
  the article does n't say anything about federalism , and d66 called on a freeze for transfer of powers just before the election , prompting foreign minister frans timmermans to post on his facebook page `` d66 is suddenly also ` very euro critical ' '' . 
  misleading title , to say the least, 
  same as everyone else who 's in politics then . 
  what was he asked to clarify ? 
  beat me to it, 
  it 's far from over - i 'm sure the uk will mount another legal challenge once the ftt countries actually decide what it is they actually want ( the current proposals that have been released are vague ) . 
  [ sweden will probably join the uk in that legal action . 
  ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-06/sweden-is-closer-to-backing-u-k-transaction-tax-challenge-borg.html ), 
  thanks - you should update the wikipedia citations !, 
  to me the wiki wording is a bit vague - but then the supporting citation says this :  the eu expects the tax to raise nearly $ 60bn across the region every year of which just over a fifth will come from the uk . 
  mr semeta said all the money raised in the uk would go to the british budget , though he was less clear about what arrangements would follow should britain not implement the controversial tax . 
  which is n't quite the same thing . 
  there 's no mention of reduced contributions either . 
  so - a bit more research into the proposal suggests that they have n't actually worked out how to collect this tax yet . 
  [ here 's the actual proposal ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/com_2013_71_en.pdf ) ( your wiki link did n't answer the question ) - i did a search for `` collection '' and point 22 - page 19 says that the commission should grant themselves `` implementing powers '' - which sounds dangerously vague . 
  [ there 's another article released ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/other_taxes/financial_sector/faq_en.pdf ) that suggests different ways to collect - and this is partly the reason that the legal challenge from the uk was denied - because no one really knows what the final proposal will be yet . 
  and so once the proposal * is * finished i 'm sure the uk will challenge it again . 
  if i 've got this wrong , i 'm happy to be corrected . 
   why does the eu need tax-raising powers ? 
  a good question - does anyone know where the proceeds of this tax will end up ? 
  and who it would be collected by ? 
   hft it is devoid of any economic sense and is leeching of/distorting the real productive market economy . 
  i do n't want to weigh in about the rights and wrongs of hft - but i think that since hft began the spread between the bid and ask price has fallen pretty dramatically from something like 0.2 % to 0.002 % - two orders of magnitude - which actually has a real benefit to trades . 
  `` i 'll tell you what we 're not going to do . 
  we 're not going to go with ukip [ ... ] their immigration policy looks ridiculous '' even pro-independence free-market types who want the uk out of the eu say that ukip 's immigration policy is wrong . 
  maybe they should listen ? 
   degree in sociology unskilled . 
   as long as the lobbying does n't become an over fed industry of its own without a register , or a log , or a registered list of interests for meps ( i 've tried to look for one before , i ca n't find anything online ) - how can we know if it 's a problem or not ? 
   nope for the purposes of selling stuff to the rest of the union ( which is what this topic is about ) - could you explain the difference ? 
  i do n't think there is except perhaps for the free movement of labor . 
   yea , only the pragmatism might be in this case to teach other eu countries a lesson that you ca n't just hop in and out of eu at will without consequences . 
  that seems to me the opposite of pragmatism considering the uk buys more from the bloc than it sells back .
