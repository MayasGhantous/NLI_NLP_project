  but it would be sheer madness . 
  but then say that building towards the iso standard ( which is n't anything to do with the eu ) makes the case that you should be in the eu ? 
  have i misunderstood something ? 
  giving up your right to * conform * to eu decisions , but choosing to , if they make sense . 
   after all , this is about the common market no , we 're talking about the eu and how the swiss are n't in it . 
  did the swiss have to enforce the new bonus cap ? 
  my point still stands . 
  however , switzerland did have a referendum last month which voted 67.9 percent in favour of allowing shareholders to veto executive pay proposals and banning big rewards for new and departing managers . 
  they can do it better themselves . 
   trade agreements are a prime example for where it is obviously better to be a bigger power - one of the main reasons the eu was created . 
  a fast trade agreement usually does n't do much , what you want is a good trade agreement . 
  you also need the political power to enforce this agreement . 
  good luck for switzerland trying to enforce anything against china . 
  i do n't think you understand that the eu is protectionist and that the swiss export quite a lot . 
  the chinese want swiss goods and they did n't have to wait for the eu to decide for over a year . 
  if the swiss want cheap goods from china that other eu countries do n't want us to have ( cheap cars will be veto 'd by france , etc ) then they can . 
   you also do n't seem to understand the mechanism of standards . 
  could swiss companies produce according to half a dozen standards for their varying customers ? 
  of course . 
  but it would be sheer madness . 
  you would have to switch out production machines , change production cycles , have half a dozen different ways of documenting everything and the possibility of very costly errors would be extremely high . 
  that 's why companies usually stick to just one standard . 
  and that 's usually the biggest/most lucrative . 
  you 're saying i ca n't buy a swiss watch in the eu now ? 
  and that if i went to japan i could n't buy the the * exact same * swiss watch ? 
  despite differing standards ? 
  oh , wait you can - here 's proof : http://www.amazon.co.jp/\u30aa\u30e1\u30ac-omega-\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc-\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb-3570-50/dp/b000ikwcq2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1365069689&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=omega+speedmaster http://www.amazon.co.uk/omega-3570-50-00-speedmaster-professional/dp/b000ejpdok/ref=sr_1_4?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1365069660&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=omega what one standard are they sticking to ? 
  their own , which is more than enough for other markets . 
   your last point : there were countless referendums since the eu was created . 
  they are called general elections . 
  face it : the people of continental europe are far more positive about the eu than many british eu-sceptics think . 
  in my rather large social circle i know exactly nobody who would like to see the eu fail . 
  aside from the fundamental difference between a referendum and a general election . 
  i do n't think you really got the jist of my point . 
  i do n't want to see the eu fail , i want a different eu to the one that is here now . 
  in your * fucking massive * circle of friends ( :p ) i 'm sure there 's people who think the same . 
  i go to copenhagen quite a lot to see family . 
  that place seems very safe . 
  there 's chavs in christiantown , and the odd brass/addict knocking about the train station but they 're not going to bother you ... well , unless you wanted to dick something or get crack i suppose . 
  disclaimer : i live in london , whitechapel - apparently the crime rate is quite high http://www.ukcrimestats.com/neighbourhood/metropolitan_police/whitechapel, 
  the murder map says otherwise : http://www.murdermap.co.uk/murder-map.asp, 
  there 's a lot of financial service sectors that will get punished which had nothing to do with the crisis . 
  i think the big one is being exempt from financial regulation ( they can probably do it better themselves ) . 
  then there 's no cap , eu regional policy , etc etc. 
  for a country like switzerland , these are good things . 
  ... also trade agreements . 
  the eu afaik is still talking to china about what their trade agreement should be . 
  the swiss have already agreed one . 
   they do n't get a say on new regulations that are coming their way . 
  if you mean things like selling to the rest of the eu , then of course you have to follow the standards set , but you have to do that if you sell to japan , or china . 
  again , i do n't think it 's a big issue for a country like switzerland who export high quality goods . 
  finally , the reason they are n't in the eu is because * their politicians listened to their electorate * when they held a referendum on the issue . 
  and that was that . 
  i 'd like a swiss style relationship with the eu for the uk as well . 
  thank god you 're not in charge then . 
  so we 're actually in a federation of europe now ? 
  we just do n't know it because it 's written in a different way ? 
  which was n't the point i was making . 
  semantics are important in legal documents . 
  is there any that mention a federation ? 
  there 's no federation of europe to vote or not vote on . 
  that 's the only point i was trying to make . 
  if there was . 
  i 'd prefer that it was put it to the public vote, 
  yeah , apparently . 
  wobblewagon posted a decent explanation above . 
  there 's a difference between * all * eu law , and the wholesale federalisation of europe that the parent commenter was saying would happen ( despite it not being openly discussed , voted , ratified , etc ) . 
  i was responding to that . 
  it 's only a double standard if you think that the eu directive on bananas holds the same weight as literally redefining what your nation actually is . 
  by your reasoning no nation-defining changes should ever be put to the public vote because you might have voted for an mp 4 years ago ? 
  not really , once it 's been tested in court it 's often quite clear what uk legislation means in practice . 
  a union can be many things ... 
  care to name any that have mentioned a federation outright ? 
  forget all of that . 
  no one has voted for a federation . 
  people did vote indirectly for the mps that ended up signing the many treaties that call for ` an ever closer union ' . 
  but it 's a stretch to call that a drive for federation . 
  that euro borg cube has a non-regulation green lights on it . 
   it just proves that together we stand , divided we fall . 
  for sure , and it 's the implementation that is the sticking point here . 
  it kind of feels at the moment that it 's more like `` together we 've been hamstrung by poor and opaque governance , divided is no longer an option '' . 
  the federation no one wants or voted for . 
  got a love-hate relationship with / r/europe i find myself venting all the time and yet i always come back . 
  i read your comment in a northen irish voice . 
  do n't know why ... 
  ... which mars20 posted against but did n't proof read at all . 
  ... from a german publication no less . 
  when dealing with the charge that germany is the ` austerity dictator ' - a term which i have never heard anyone use ... 
  i think there 's going to be great amounts of ` anecdotal evidence ' flying around from either side of the table . 
  i 'd be interested to see how far this metaphor can be stretched . 
  canada says austerity worked for them in 1994 . 
  that 's the only example that comes to mind without trawling the internet . 
  i do n't understand how genuine efficiencies and cutting wasteful spending could n't * not * work - obviously with correct implementation . 
   the problem with austerity is it does n't work . 
  correct implementation of austerity will work . 
  things like genuine efficiencies , and cuts in areas where monies are being misspent . 
  plus - when it 's got to the point where your credit rating is smashed to bits and no one wants to lend you anymore money - surely austerity is the * only * way forward ? 
  at some point we 're just going to have to spend less and work harder . 
  i think the germans have just realised it sooner than everyone else .
