i went to bulgaria in 2011 and the time i did n't spend in a drunken coma the country seemed poor , but not dirt poor . 
  i remember talking to the hotel manager by the side of the pool and he explained the bulgarian mafia and the shoot outs they have with the russian mafia , i thought he was spinning me a yarn until i saw the vice documentary about the mafia there . 
  beautiful country with a real chance to become a big tourist destination . 
  it 's a real shame . 
  `` they went with songs to the battle , they were young . 
  straight of limb , true of eye , steady and aglow . 
  they were staunch to the end against odds uncounted , they fell with their faces to the foe . 
  they shall grow not old , as we that are left grow old : age shall not weary them , nor the years condemn . 
  at the going down of the sun and in the morning , we will remember them . 
  they mingle not with their laughing comrades again ; they sit no more at familiar tables of home ; they have no lot in our labour of the day-time ; they sleep beyond england 's foam '', 
  where are they getting all of this british gear from ? 
  shame about our national team . 
  agreed ... 
  if you can get around the not-shaving thing ... 
  went skiing in bavaria once and the people were awesome . 
  although i 'm from the west country , which is kind of like england 's bavaria . 
  germany !, 
  went to bavaria last winter on my first every skiing trip and it was beautiful . 
  breathtaking scenery , kind locals and awesome looking architecture . 
  an old woman even helped me out with some change at the checkouts in lidl . 
  oh , also me and my mates got thoroughly plastered on your beautiful beers .

  although i disagree with the israeli embassy , i do think the republic of ireland 's government are particularly spineless in relation to their laws on abortion . 
  the guy is an idiot . 
  and a saddam supporter . 
  `` farming simulator ; public disorder '' . 
  i 've heard !, 
  i 'd be lucky to be put through as a student in the cinemas here ... 
  in a civil war ? 
  how many turkish or greek nationals are claiming asylum ? 
  even if you lived in syria , you 'd probably still have to risk your life travelling to the boarder . 
  those coming from west africa have the delightful sight-seeing jolly through countries like sudan , libya , eritrea , south sudan and ethiopia . 
  their fight does n't start when they reach the turkish border or the greek islands . 
  surely travelling through some of the most active warzones as a refugee is a bit of a young man 's game ... would n't it stand to reason that most of the refugees that make it , or even attempt it , are young , able bodied and male ? 
  meaning that most of the refugees accepted by european countries are of this demographic ? 
  do n't have any figures to support this , just thought that was how it worked ? 
  us brits are seen as the americans of europe . 
  what do people say ? 
  i think its because many people here are politically minded and many people dislike us political decisions and how the uk follow them . 
  as a british infantryman , i often get it in the ear about iraq and so on ... 
  that 's true . 
  i got lyme disease after being bitten by a tic while on my work experience ... what an experience that was . 
  that edge . 
  i think they get a bad rap in europe . 
  they 're not as bad as we make them out to be ... 
  finally , a chance to put my bf4 skills to good use !, 
  they talk about how much they hate pissed up brits and so on , but are happy to take our money and put on cheap deals and such . 
  they know the crowd that they are attracting . 
  yes , the tourists are shitty . 
  but they could easily put them off from coming to a certain place . 
  why do n't they ? 
  because they want their money . 
   so you want to visit france ? 
  said no brit ever . 
  i wonder how intricate the picture of the gun was ... 
  i wish i went to see all this stuff when i went . 
  i just spent the week in a alcohol-induced coma on sunny beach . 
  that ' princess diana 's death was somehow planned by the royal family . 
  not really , romanian forces * had * to withdraw from iraq in 2009 due to the sofa agreement ;  under the terms of the sofa agreement between the united states and iraq , all non-us forces must leave iraq prior to july 31 , 2009 . 
  as a result , romania decided to withdraw . 
  so it 's hardly like they were scrambling to leave . 
  they left a few days before they legally had to be gone from iraq . 
  the also did `` prisoner interrogation at camp cropper and camp bucca in the american sector '' , so you can imagine what that entailed . 
  hardly a job for a force of soldiers that you claim were there against their will , not wanting to participate * only * because the americans are forcing them . 
  also ;  later , the eastern european `` vilnius ten '' countries , estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovenia , slovakia , bulgaria , ** romania ** , croatia -- all now members of the eu -- , albania , and the republic of macedonia issued another statement on iraq , in general ** support of the us 's position ** so do n't make out that romania was forced to participate by the us ... romania was obviously a trust-worthy and supporting ally in the iraq war . 
  uh , no . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_armed_forces#modernization ) ;  romanian troops participated in the occupation of iraq , reaching a peak of 730 soldiers before being slowly drawn down to 350 soldiers . 
  romania terminated its mission in iraq and withdrew its last troops on july 24 , 2009 . 
  it was in the past , but these days not so much ( strategically ) . 
  i agree . 
  as far as the international community is concerned , the falklands are british . 
  the people are british . 
  but we need to talk to argentina and sort something out so they stop making claims . 
  could say we have a [ reputation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyfwvioiaqy ) to uphold . 
  you 're a rockstar ? 
  loyalist paramilitaries were terrorists just like the ira . 
  i 'm in the british army so i have a bit of a bias view . 
  yes , the british army did some things that were totally wrong . 
  but it was hardly nail bombing pubs and executing civilians out right . 
  no body was innocent , you 're right , but the ira were terrorists with no regard for civilians . 
  yeah it was a time of bitter hatred . 
  that same day the bomb went off , the ira ambushed a british army convoy killing 18 soldiers . 
  the real thing that angers me ( from what i 've seen ) is ( mainly americans ) who have some kind of view of the ira as freedom fighters or liberators , fighting against the british like during the american revolution . 
  no , they 're just terrorists and murderers . 
  are you talking about gerry adam 's statement ? 
  price charles actually [ met ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-32786393 ) adam 's a few months ago . 
  and sinn fein have n't changed much , they still have connections with the ira . 
  in 2005 , a us special envoy said `` it is hard to understand how a european country in the year 2005 can have a private army associated with a political party '' . 
  still pretty shady . 
  [ yep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_mountbatten,_1st_earl_mountbatten_of_burma#death ) . 
  true . 
  but it 's ammunition in the hands of nigel farage , in the sense that your average joe is n't going to know we are n't involved unless they 're told . 
  it 's just easy for farage and his party to `` spin '' . 
  i completely agree , and i understand . 
  but this is just more ammunition in the hands of farage ... 
  creating a `` european federation '' and so on . 
  obviously it makes more financial sense to do it than not to do it for publicity , but that 's how its going to look . 
  i 'm pro-eu , but i really do n't think this is a good idea . 
  and it wo n't float here in the uk , i can tell you that for free . 
  this kind of thing is what pushes people to join anti-eu political parties like ukip .
