any future trade arrangement must offer the departing country worse terms than full membership did i really do n't understand why so many of my fellow brits are seeing this as a really harsh , hardcore thing . 
  it seems like common sense to me . 
  you leave the club , you lose the benefits . 
  you do n't cancel your gym membership and still expect to be allowed to pop in and use the showers whenever you want . 
   if an mp voted against what their constituency voted , i doubt they would be re-elected in 2020 . 
  i look forward to my local labour mp going against the party to vote against article 50 then . 
  it 's actually more complicated because the referendum was done by local council area not parliamentary constituency area , so it 's not straightforward to determine which way a particular constituency voted . 
  in my case , york city council has a pretty strong overlap with york central constituency , so its a reasonable assumption that the constituency is broadly pro-remain , but ca n't be definitely determined . 
  i believe that a statistician has gone through and worked it out and if each mp voted as their constituency did , article 50 would get something like 75 % of the parliamentary vote . 
  so it would still pass , but i think the opportunity to dissent and have that noted in record is important . 
  there is also a clear difference i think between * `` my constituents voted for brexit but i think they 're wrong and will be voting against a50 '' and * `` my constituents voted against brexit so in line with their wishes and against my official party line i will be voting against a50 '' i do n't think that the latter mp can reasonably be accused of `` going against the will of the people '' even if she is voting against the nationwide majority . 
  at least it 's not an asterisk, 
  bloody hell , a list of `` countries who have invaded x '' that we 're not on ... 
  sort of an official pronouncement . 
  tends to have connotations in the uk because of the business with salman rushdie back in the 80s . 
  the way it was usef in british media suggested that `` fatwa '' meant `` death sentence '' and that idea has stuck . 
  welp , i paid # 49.99 for $ 50 at thomas cook last week so i do n't think they 're far off, 
  it 's been a while , i forget . 
  cheers . 
  we 've got a few favourite places and things to eat , but always good to see more . 
  sadly a bit early in the year for sturm ... 
  i lived in burgenland for a bit and am a devotee of the bauernmischung ; white wine and almdudler, 
  off to vienna soon for a week of almdudler , k\u00e4sekrainer and kaiserschmarr ` n. 
  and possibly some tourist stuff . 
  a ritual object ( = `` we have no idea what this is '' ), 
  what 's odd in a way is that the `` western betrayal '' thing was quite heavily promoted by the communist state , so you might expect it to be more prevalent among the older generation than the younger . 
  i thought rachiu was an evolved pikachu, 
  i get that too - my primary foreign language is german , but i know enough french to hold a basic conversation - but my brain goes into `` i 'm speaking foreign now '' mode and starts chucking german words in there if i ca n't immediately think of the french one . 
  the royal navy is n't dry , is it ? 
  i know the americans are but i thought we still served booze on our boats, 
   voters workers ? 
  blame google translate ... what would one say instead then ? 
  we 've recently had cause here in the uk to remember what heroes firefighters are . 
   he leave campaign won because while we were talking about numbers they were appealing to blind nationalism . 
  i also have a feeling that a lot of the campaigners ' hearts were n't really in it either . 
  looking at theresa may 's stance on brexit now , it 's difficult to remember that she was a remain campaigner . 
  presumably she decided to back `` remain '' because she thought it was a sure thing and would gain her political advantage . 
  sort of the reverse of boris johnson 's plan . 
  i always thought it was rhyming slang for `` facts '' . 
  or `` enemies of the people '' if they 're judges deciding on a matter of constitutional procedure . 
   the british have to decide if they want to be lead by their tabloids that was at least one positive thing from the recent election - the sun , mail and express spent the entire campaign banging away at the `` vote may '' , `` strong and stable '' , `` corbyn is a marxist terrorist '' , `` your patriotic duty to vote tory '' campaign , and it does n't seem to have worked, 
  i really loved gdansk when i was there a couple of years ago . 
  place is absolutely soggy with history . 
  from the brand-new flats where we were staying ( my guess would be euro 2012 money ) , we passed a hanseatic church , then some communist-era blocks , then a big prussian public building - a school , i think - with bullet holes and a couple of bigger chunks missing . 
  then we crossed under the tram line and ended up in the city - by way of the house of dante gabriel fahrenheit . 
  one day we took a boat trip out to sopot , and passed directly between the shipyards where solidarity brought down the government in 1970 and 1989 , and the westerplatte fortress where the first shots of world war 2 were fired . 
  it 's also utterly gorgeous and the food 's fantastic . 
  edit : i 'm from york , by the way - i 'm not easily impressed by history . 
  i was impressed by gdansk . 
   you need a strong and stable parliament oh do n't * you * start !, 
  are you suggesting we * should * be able to.bang people up without them having committed a crime , because we think they might in the future ? 
  well yes , i heard that very thing presented as an argument in favour of brexit : `` we 'll be able to get rid of human rights laws imposed by brussels that do n't allow us to be nast enough to the people we do n't like '', 
  yes , we hired a car , based ourselves in jelling and spent a lovely week tootling around the countryside . 
  i remember visiting vejle and horsens , and a town i ca n't now remember the name of on the shore of a lake . 
  might have been skanderborg , looking at a map . 
  please what ? 
  i 've been a few times , yes . 
  to copenhagen and to jylland . 
  maybe i got the wrong impression , then . 
  actually i have n't - never really done brussels . 
  must one of these days . 
  copenhagen 's my kind of town - rather than thinking about what sights to see and not see , it 's a great place to just wander around and see what you can find . 
  i 've never really got to grips with bigger cities like london , paris or berlin , but the compact city centres of a copenhagen or a vienna are a perfect scale for me . 
  i mean , it fits perfectly with denmark 's general lack of bombast and nationalism , but it is one of the most underwhelming major tourist sights in the world . 
  i do n't think it 's the fault of the statue , though , as much as it is the fault of the hoopla surrounding it . 
   invented by a german ( dunno why ) kadir nurman was a turkish immigrant to germany . 
  he probably did n't `` invent '' exactly but certainly popularised it . 
  i wish i could believe that , but the nhs is in crisis right now and it seems like the majority opinion is that it 's all the fault of the eu which takes our money and sends us horrid health-tourist terrorist migrants instead . 
  otherwise we would n't be looking at a landslide victory for the party actually responsible ... 
  waiter ? 
  yes , can i get a couple of vowels please ? 
  oh , i meant to also add some recommendations for artists who play modern , folk-style music . 
  again just look em up on youtube * seth lakeman * martin and eliza carthy ( separately and together ) * steeleye span ( very 70s ) * offa rex * john tams ( he of * sharpe * fame ) * [ dan webster ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3mp7sl-7hc ) ( blatant plug , he 's a mate , but rather good ), 
  some more english ones - we 've obviously got lots of regional variations in style and subject matter , and i 'm not even going to get into the welsh , scottish and irish traditions which are fantastically rich and varied too . 
  the wikipedia category page '' [ english folk songs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:english_folk_songs ) '' is a good place to have a look through - stick the name of any of them into youtube and you 'll find some good stuff . 
  here 's some of my favourites : * `` matty groves '' is a song which originates somewhere along the english/scottish border . 
  most famously covered by [ fairport convention ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1it7bp5pcki ) . 
  * `` all around my hat '' is from 19th century london , most famously covered here by [ steeleye span ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9g7azfkckc ) in 1975 * `` over the hills and far away '' is a 17th-century number that pops up in all sorts of variations . 
  here 's [ john tams ' newly written lyrics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woeyppoblaw ) for the closing credits of sharpe , which always rather liked . 
  he also played one of the riflemen , hagman . 
  * while we 're being military , there 's '' [ heart of oak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxfcdgyana ) '' , the song of the royal ( and royal canadian ) navy and '' [ british grenadiers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux3dodkxi_c ) '' which you 'll hear done on the fife and drum in any revolutionary war scenario . 
  speaking of which , the drinking song '' [ the world turned upside-down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxl-avit8tu ) '' is said to have been played at cornwallis ' surrender at yorktown , though this seems to be a myth . 
  * `` blaydon races '' is basically the unofficial national anthem of newcastle upon tyne and is often sung at newcastle united football games . 
  [ here 's a version with the lyrics written out in geordie dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6prmavjhs74 ) . 
  * just up the road , county durham ( similar but not the same dialect ) gives us the [ lambton worm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bczcoop_v2k ) based on a bit of local folklore . 
  * another one particularly bound to a specific region is '' [ the lincolnshire poacher ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8kqyjyovkc ) '' * liverpool has '' [ maggie mae ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc4gitm7pfy ) '' ( not the rod stewart song ) covered here by local group the spinners , which is why the motown band were `` the detroit spinners '' over here . 
  * and since it 's yorkshire day , we ca n't not mention '' [ on ilkla moor baht ` at ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xusq9qs2dqo ) '' , our own unofficial anthem . 
  the christmas carol '' [ while shepherds watched their flocks by night ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf90sqpbgga ) '' was originally set to this tune . 
  * americans may recognise something in the tune of 18th century drinking song '' [ to anacreon in heaven ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydaidvkv84g ) '' * oh all right , just one welsh one : men of harlech , as seen ( with new lyrics ) in [ that famous scene from zulu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xseu5zhgctc ) , just because it 's a wonderful scene . 
  `` have '' not `` had '' so presumably they mean trump, 
  the spanish netherlands became the austrian netherlands , then part of thenapoleonic french empire , then part of the united kingdom of the netherlands before breaking away as belgium . 
  the country we now call `` the netherlands '' had its independence confirmed at wesphalia in 1648 . 
  the meaning of `` netherlands '' has changed , in other words . 
  my sister got married in st michael-le-belfry , the little parish church next to york minster , one august saturday . 
  we 're in a lot of chinese holiday albums . 
  whereabouts are you ? 
  my parents come from suffolk and there 's still loads of pillboxes , casemates and even those big concrete blocks for getting in tanks ' way . 
  there 's an `` armed forces day '' as well , but it 's not really caught on yet . 
  they 're graduating from pre-school these days . 
  i shit you not .
