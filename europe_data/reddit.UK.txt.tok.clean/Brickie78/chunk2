  `` varsity '' is an old british usage though , that 's fallen out of fashion here but lingers in america . 
  i do n't know why , but i always find a dutch accent to be funny . 
  it 's something about the slight overpronunciation of the `` s '' and the slightly rounded `` u '' . 
   artillery damn , i 'm going to have to leave my 105mm howitzer at home if i go skiing in andorra ? 
  colorado it is , then . 
   a misguided sense of national inferiority complex i remember being in austria during the 1999 elections and subsequent media shitstorm ( to listen to the british press you 'd think hitler mk . 
  ii had won a crushing majority and austria was a full-on nazi state again ) . 
  while most austrian media were grumbling about foreigners `` telling them how to think '' and unjustly ostracising them , there was also a strand of `` but look !, 
  everyone 's talking about us ! '', 
  right , but in germany renting is more the norm , not just for people who ca n't afford to buy ... 
  depending on how brexit goes , i can see scotland leaving the uk in that time frame . 
  though that will be an even messier divorce . 
  if it 's going to take a lot of work to unpick 40 years of european integration , it 's going to take even more work to unpick ~ 300 years of british integration . 
  i mean , its continued survival as a single country is some measure of success . 
  just think of the sheer number of dividing factors - languages , religions , geography , history - that could pull it apart , and yet it continues to be the world 's largest functioning democracy . 
   i 'm not sure if the ` most brits are posh ' stereotype still exists outside of europe . 
  i suspect it 's more prevalent in the us than in europe , even , since europe gets to see us in shagaluf while the americans get tv butlers , cultured villains and mr darcy . 
  austria was neutral ( `` non-aligned '' ) during the cold war and this plus its geographical position at the centre of europe made vienna a popular spot for east-west summits and so on . 
  i do n't know if that 's why the iaea is there specifically but it seems plausible at least . 
  i have an old cookery book called `` italian food '' by elizabeth david . 
  it was written in the 1950s , during a time when austerity and rationing reigned at home but british tourists were starting to travel abroad on package tours . 
  italy was a popular destination , partly for the usual reasons but also because a lot if british men has served there during and after the war and were taking wives and families back to see the places they 'd been . 
  from reading the book , it seems like a lot of them were eating dreadful food ( italy had also been hit hard during the war of course ) and coming home either thinking that italian food was rubbish , or trying badly to reproduce the food they 'd had over there . 
  this was in the days when if you wanted olive oil you went to the pharmacist ( it was used for clearing earwax buildup ) . 
   as i write this , i have just come across , in a respected monthly magazine , a recipe for a risotto made with twice-cooked patna rice and a tin of tomato soup . 
  what way is that of enlarging our knowledge and arousing our interest ? 
  * minestrone * , that hefty , rough-and-ready but nutritionally sound traditional midday soup of northern italian agricultural and manual workers , features frequently in such publications . 
  often the readers are told that it can be made with some such ingredients as a bouillon cube , a tin of chicken noodle soup and a few frozen french beans . 
  a crumpet or made-up scone mi spread with tomato puree and a slice of processed cheese turns up regularly as a neapolitan * pizza * . 
  ( i also love the fact that she 's still having to explain minestrone and put `` pizza '' in italics because it 's a foreign word ) . 
  yeah , but jamie oliver `` celebrated yorkshire food '' by making eccles cakes ( eccles being a suburb of manchester ) ... 
  what are they round your way then ? 
  i 'll add another to our ever-growing list : philip davies , mp for shipley . 
  he 's been an mp for two years and in that time he has * complained during a debate on male suicide that militant feminists and politically-correct men are ruining the country .

  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/11/vulture-fund-bill-threatened ) there 's more , but i already feel like i want a shower . 
  for english it seems to be the `` th '' sounds that take some getting used to . 
  they often come out as `` s '' for the voiced and `` z '' for the unvoiced, 
  york here , pedestrianised city centre since ... gosh , as long as i can remember . 
  1980s , perhaps . 
  it does pretty well for us in the most part . 
  pedestrianisation is n't 100 % ; there are a few roads through the city which are still open for traffic all day and it 's only between 10 and 4 or something , so deliveries and so on can be done . 
  cities like ours just were n't designed for cars , and as cars have become bigger , heavier and more prevalent over the decades the problem only gets worse . 
  not only does the city become more clogged with traffic but historic buildings get damaged . 
  it 's good for tourists and shoppers , as long as it 's supported by things like a good bus , cycle route and park & ride network , and makes working in the city centre so much nicer . 
   so what you 're saying is that estonia did the uk thing . 
  joined a union with the main goal to make a state and now wants to backtrack . 
  to be fair , when we joined back in the 70s , it was much less federalist and more of a trading partnership/peace organisation . 
  while i 'm a great supporter of the eu and the famous `` ever-closer union '' , i am sympathetic with the view of people i talked to who supported joining back then but voted to leave now , because `` this is n't what we voted to join '' . 
  in retrospect , if we were going to have a referendum we should have done it over maastricht in 1992 , rather than spending the last quarter-century acting as if we were being held prisoner against our will in the eu . 
  it 's been an embarrassment to pro-european brits like myself to be constantly the ones demanding opt-outs and rebates and exceptions . 
  i love york but after about 8pm every single night of the week , especially in the summer , it 's like high season in magaluf . 
  peaple staggering about absolutely blasted , vomiting in the street , trying to pick fights . 
  somehow it 's become the stag and hen capital of the north but it 's a quarter the size of places like manchester or newcastle so it all gets concentrated into a few streets . 
  then add in the carnage that is race weekends . 
  like / u/wellnowiminvolved , i ca n't begrudge northern ireland the extra funding , depending on what exactly is done with it ( ie not just tax cuts for the wealthy - i genuinely have n't seen the detail ) . 
  i do worry about what it means for the good friday agreement in which the uk government is supposed to remain scrupulously neutral in all ni matters , but i suspect , and hope , that all parties will agree that it 's not worth going back to the bad old days over and come up with some acceptable formula until it blows over . 
  personally , i 'd have preferred the parliament to remain hung and the conservatives to have had to collaborate , compromise and persuade - but that 's not the way things are done here , sadly . 
  as u/kwowo said , there are advantages to having a head of state who is completely apolitical and not tainted by whatever governmental scandals are going on - a particular problem of the us system where the head of state and head of government are both the same person . 
  i do think they cost a lot of taxpayers ' money - the argument is always that they bring in more in tourism income than we spend on them , but i do n't know how you 'd measure that . 
  i find myself envious of the scandinavian and dutch monarchies who seem to have more modest circumstances and be closer to the people because of it , but i find it difficult to imagine that could work here , what with the british press and all . 
  a national * day * of mourning is a bit much for us , though as you say when the queen dies there 'll probably be one . 
  we do seem to have recently started having 1 or 2 minute silences for things like the manchester and london attacks , and probably for the grenfell tower fire too , though i have n't heard specifically . 
  i lived in oberwart for a year and came to really appreciate the landscape of suedburgenland . 
  nothing showy but i 'd take local buses around and sometimes it 'd be wide open spaces and heaths and sometimes it 'd be steeply wooded valleys with castles and lovely little places lkke guessing, 
  ah , yes , you 're right . 
  are dynamo still going in any form ? 
  i mean , presumably these names come from the communist days of factory teams . 
  `` lokomotiv '' or `` rapid '' were usually railway workers , `` dynamo '' for electrical workers , `` sparta ( k ) '' for army teams and so on . 
   i have really vague memories of a west german series where a young blond kid was being chased around what looked like a volcanic island ( black sand ) by a sinister chap in a mercedes with yellow headlights . 
  based on said tv cream article , by the way , i think this may have been the legend of tim tyler ( or timm thaler in the original ) . 
  as others have said , we do n't get a lot of foreign-language shows in the uk , even dubbed ones . 
  there have been some exceptions - * heimat * was shown back when it came out , and * das boot * as well , both in dubbed versions . 
  in recent years there 's been a bit of an uptick with the `` arty '' channels like bbc4 picking up series like * forbrydelsen * and * borgen * , running the swedish * wallander * series when the kenneth branagh one was current and so on . 
  originally it was all scandinavian crime stuff , but they 've branched out to other things like * deutschland 83 * and * unser mutter unser vaeter * ( which got the terrible title of `` generation war '' here ) . 
  netflix has started showing some of these too . 
  foreign-language programming is definitely seen here as an arty , intelligent , niche thing . 
  you 'd never get `` inspector rex '' because it 's too `` light '' for the perceived niche and too foreign for everyone else . 
  oh , and childrens ' programming , at least in my day , was a bit of an exception - the singing ringing tree is fondly remembered by people a bit older than i am , there was the moonins of course and i believe the magic roundabout started as a french series . 
  i have really vague memories of a west german series where a young blond kid was being chased around what looked like a volcanic island ( black sand ) by a sinister chap in a mercedes with yellow headlights . 
  there 's a rather nice blog post about euro-kids-tv in the 70s [ here ] ( http://bloodandporridge.co.uk/wp/?p=1085 ) . 
  also tv cream : http://tv.cream.org/lookin/imports/, 
  never made it here , but i gather australia had it . 
  i was living in austria when gedeon burkhard took over , so that 's how i got to hear about it . 
  there is a specific group , the english defence league , who do , but if you look at britain first or the bnp or the old national front , they usually use the union jack . 
  `` it 's complicated '' * far-right nationalist symbol ? 
  check . 
  * appropriate for making into bunting at a garden party ? 
  check . 
  * symbolic of being `` better together '' in opposition to separatist scots ? 
  check * symbolic of being `` better apart '' in opposition to european federalists ? 
  check * appropriate for waving at engish competitors at sporting events ?
