  wilders will never take 51 % of seats and no-one will coalition with him , so he 'll never get into power . 
  pirate  fash . 
  well , do n't just vote . 
  make an informed vote . 
  some parties are not an informed vote . 
  brexit and trump were won on less . 
  fantastic reply . 
  you really showed me , aw jee whizz !, 
  17m voted brexit out of 65m brits . 
  it was also the underlying theme of the whole leave campaign . 
  not all leave voters are bigots ... but all bigots are leave voters . 
  you had farage and his poster that echoed actual nazi propaganda . 
  the official leave campaign showed a map of turkey bordering syria and iraq and claimed that 75m turks would be coming to the uk and all those who could get into turkey from the region . 
  jo cox was assassinated by a pro-leave , literal fascist radicalised by all the `` traitor '' rhetoric . 
  since the vote , the mail and sun have pushed the `` enemies of the people '' line alongside `` remoaners '' being `` unpatriotic '' . 
  farage , gove , etc all made referenced to immigration in almost every debate . 
  people wanted to regain their sovereignty that sat , as it has done since 1681 , in the house of commons ... but then freaked out at the reality that they would need to vote on passing article 50 and the final deal . 
  which links in to all the hatred towards gina miller . 
  then you 've got the whole `` empire .2 '' rhetoric that may has been pushing lately and all this `` rebuild ties with the commonwealth '' to invoke the 1800s imperialist jingoism ... oh we 've come full circle . 
  the uk is innately jingoistic . 
  you can cry about it all you like , but our history proves it . 
  not just the colonialism , but also the concentration camps , subjugation of non-whites , the atlantic slave trade , genocide of native americans . . 
  i could go on but you 're probably proud of all that and now are happy to fly the british flag and cry whenever you sing the national anthem . 
  north west england . 
  lot of working class kids get targeted for army recruitment , lots of mail readers , jingos . 
  i know a guy who joined the army to `` kill muzzies '' and vote leave . 
  wonder why . 
  * cough * jingo * cough *, 
  i 'm guessing you either do n't like being a jingo or being called one ? 
  my views have n't taken a battering . 
  they 've been emboldened actually . 
  okay , nige . 
  you seem to struggle with reddit . 
  you 're vaguely familiar of newcastle .

  scotland contributes more [ per capita ] ( https://fullfact.org/economy/do-scots-contribute-more-taxes-rest-uk-13582/ ) . 
  not from newcastle then . 
  that 's some spin to blame refugees . 
  and british innate jingoism . 
  and they were all pointless and divisive opinion polls . 
  as if you give a shit about rights . 
  i 've never met a classical liberal who does . 
  we 've had 4 , and none are binding . 
  4 is still too many . 
   that exalts nation and often race above the individual `` we turn finally back to the old policy of papering over the cracks , dividing a shrinking cake , and a cowardly multiculturalism - a cabinet-forest where ahmed aboutaleb minister of integration , jan marijnissen minister of social affairs , wijnand duivendak minister prosecutor harry van bommel minister of economic affairs and klaas de vries , head of the aivd will be - or making sure we by choosing a right turn for clarity and vigor , growth and prosperity , and for naming and defending our cultural identity ?

  - wilders in [ klare wijn ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewj07mc3ss7sahwkkmakhebydyaqfggdmaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.pvv.nl%2findex.php%2fcomponent%2fcontent%2farticle%2f30-publicaties%2f706-klare-wijn.html&amp;usg=afqjcnhv_9fswiwolnsy--qyt0n96hu2ca&amp;sig2=hkus8ozbnozejpp1zdwrvq ) . 
  basically , the same old schtick of preserving `` traditional dutch values '' and that allowing there to be non-whites in the netherlands is `` papering over the cracks , dividing a shrinking cake , and a cowardly multiculturalism '' . 
  suggesting that there 's something brave in being intolerant . 
  he 's stoking up the national pride that people will put above society . 
  see this written by a pro-wilders author , where he declares that it is [ `` time for liberation '' ] ( reddit wo n't allow a zerohedge article , so i 'll let you google it . ) . 
   severe economic and social regimentation `` another and smaller , so better government . 
  this relates to the reform of government should be reduced both national and european , in which the role of government and the public , including through a comprehensive tax reduction , again must be given the space and freedom to take initiatives and to develop creativity '' - wilders in klare wijn . 
  here he 's wanting a smaller government that `` must be given the space and freedom to take initiatives and to develop creativity '' . 
  i wonder what that means . 
  i wonder if he 's saying that he wants a small government that is less accountable to levels of government wherein he can push his luck in what he institutes . 
  hitler had article 48 which allowed him to take control of the reichstag and germany very swiftly without the efforts of having to reduce the government branches still loyal to democracy . 
  wilders is also very quick to label people dictators and traitors as a move of misdirection . 
  wilders also has an incredible hatred for islam , muslims , turks and arabic peoples . 
  he wants to [ ban ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/768854382834311168 ) islam , mosques , the qu ` ran , headscarves ( though i assume he means only if they look `` brown '' because a he wo n't be banning the habit ) , as well as all asylum seekers and muslim migrants . 
  he has n't yet outlined what he 'll do with the muslims currently in the netherlands , but i do n't think it will be much different to restricting their rights to vote , work , own businesses etc along similar lines of history . 
  [ these ] ( http://gatesofvienna.net/2017/02/geert-wilders-might-be-in-serious-danger/ ) are the kind of people who support him . 
  so if we look back at historical comparisons , we 're pretty damn similar with a lot of fascsism . 
  wilders can not explicitly state that he wants to rule as a fascist dictator or as part of a council of fascists , ( hitler was n't really the brains behind the reich ) . 
  that would end his chances at an election or even entering into any coalition . 
  but do n't just take my word for it , here 's some similar interpretations of wilders : https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=9&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewj2_j-st87sahxqlcakhyhocqqqfghdmag&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.joop.nl%2fopinies%2fgeert-wilders-een-fascist-rob-riemen-een-fascist&amp;usg=afqjcng_ozzurtcs7yv67zek03oxxrwoow&amp;sig2=ldeqptv-mmxyyp0exqhhiw http://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/trump-brexit-le-pen-geert-wilders-far-right-new-age-of-fascism-a7602336.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/19/the-rise-of-the-far-right-in-europe-is-not-a-false-alarm/ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/marine-le-pen-geert-wilders-norbert-hofer-rise-of-fascism-europe-far-right-leaders-donald-trump-a7417276.html https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/world/europe/rise-of-donald-trump-tracks-growing-debate-over-global-fascism.html https://theconversation.com/no-this-isnt-the-1930s-but-yes-this-is-fascism-68867 and then on the new rise of fascism : http://www.openculture.com/2016/05/noam-chomsky-on-whether-the-rise-of-trump-resembles-the-rise-of-fascism-in-1930s-germany.html, 
   azism wasnt bad in the eyes of the allies up to ww2 , as it was the political enemy of the commies , which especially britain liked very much . 
  unless you 're only reading the diaries of oswald mosley then you 're very wrong . 
  chruchill , attlee , orwell , lansbury , eden and even the monarchy knew that fascism was a huge risk to peace and liberty . 
  as well as the time when brits thoroughly [ bashed the fash ] ( http://time.com/4516276/cable-street-battle-london-east-end-80-years/ ) . 
   youre one massive asshole who lies and spreads misinformation without countering arguments . 
  you studied ww2 ? 
  you mean you watched history channel . 
  no , it means i studied it . 
  if you defend fascism then you 're an apologist at best . 
   my family lost several family members that fought in the resitance , and im a classical liberal myself . 
  your weak accusations are sad . 
  and ? 
  name a family in europe who did n't lost family members ? 
  half of my great-uncles were killed either in europe or south asia . 
  does n't mean i can now be sympathetic to literal fascists like wilders . 
   ideologies go further than a few bulletpoints lol . 
  well , obviously , but if you ca n't grasp the simple definition why would i go in depth . 
  however if you [ insist ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yljff/the_dutch_far_rights_election_donors_are_almost/desjid6/ ) . 
   fascism even has place for a monarchy , as italy had during fascism . 
  thats unthinkable under nazism . 
  what do you think the fuhrer was ? 
  it was treated as a position exactly the same as a kaiser or monarch . 
  different name does n't change what it was . 
  edit : had to change a link because reddit did n't like some of the links i used . 
  the pro-wilders ones unsurprisingly are on some kind of watchlist . 
  yep , really dangerous when your views are called out for what they are . 
  `` nazism wasnt per se bad '' - [ stenny007 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5yb35e/a_14yearold_danish_boy_doing_research_for_a/dep6mkh/ ) you will have passed the definitions to get here but let 's try again . 
  fascism : far-right , authoritarian and nationalist . 
  that is the definition . 
  not all far-right are fascist , not all nationalists are fascist , not all authoritarians are fascists ... but if you 're all three , then you 're a fascist . 
   you fuckers have cried wolf too many times to be believed anymore . 
  you do n't know me . 
  if you get pissed off at people calling fascists ` fascists ' then maybe do n't support fascists , eh ? 
  or if you do , why would you be offended by a term that is the actual definition of what they support ? 
  it 's like a communist being offended to be called a communist .
