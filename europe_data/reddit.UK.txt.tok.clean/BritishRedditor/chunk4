  are you suggesting that all laws be at the federal level ? 
  you ca n't generalise a country as large as america . 
   relax commie . 
  you immediately lose all credibility with statements like that . 
  defaults , i mean . 
  i would assert that any individual who wilfully partakes in a serious political discussion is already more of an intellectual than the average citizen in any country . 
  oh please , stop with the melodrama . 
  reddit never had an `` elitist image '' . 
  but it has always been home to a good deal of sincere and intellectual discussion ; the immature and troll content found on the front page does n't change that . 
  to casually dismiss all the well-maintained subreddits and quality content is downright cynical . 
   no , but i 'd certainly pit them against ireland and the uk or italy and france . 
  you could n't be more wrong . 
  culturally , people from new mexico and massachusetts share * so much more * culturally than the people of the uk/italy/france . 
  us state boundaries and country borders are n't even remotely comparable . 
  haha . 
  such a distinctly finnish accent . 
  it 's not that unusual . 
  i consider a 10 % tip standard at any restaurant in the uk . 
  i 'm really surprised to see other brits say `` i never tip at all '' . 
  i see that wales has migrated to cornwall . 
  he did n't even do a bad job . 
  the nationality `` british '' has nothing to do with the island `` britain '' . 
  it is purely the nationality of citizens of the united kingdom . 
  this comment suggests that you 're not an economist subscriber , because they make their editorial line pretty obvious . 
   the lingua franca changes a lot and binding the eu on the current one is binding us to american culture . 
  how is that anything but positive ? 
  do you want to able to speak with fewer people ? 
  is this a joke ? 
  by all measures , the us is a first world country . 
  not only that , it 's one of the richest and most developed of the first world countries . 
   the eyes of nature there 's no such thing . 
  without a sentient mother nature figure who can speak with absolute authority on these matters , what man says goes . 
   and how does being `` exceptionally more intelligent '' justify animal slavery it does n't . 
  and i do n't know you why you asked me that . 
  i was objecting to your point that humans and wild animals are `` the same '' . 
  if that were true , human lives and ( non-human ) animals lives would be considered equally important . 
  the whole world could turn vegan and we 'd still value human lives over animal lives . 
   name how exactly a human is different than any animal in the eyes of nature . 
  human are * exceptionally * more intelligent . 
  it 's not a trivial point . 
  it 's a myth . 
  there 's more to an accent than its rhoticity . 
  and as indicated in the page you linked to , several british accents retain the rhotic / r / . 
  how ? 
  do you actually read my comment ? 
   this time the man and his family `` fell on the tracks '' instead of just being truthful and saying he threw them on the tracks to play the victim . 
  you 're really clutching at straws now . 
  the video is there for everyone to see , and they did indeed `` fall onto the tracks '' [ see definition 2.1 ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fall ) . 
   also nice video editing to make it seem like the guy was n't a complete lunatic * was n't ? 
  * you see him push the woman to the ground and literally hold on to her with his teeth . 
  ** that is exactly what happened ** . 
  the video is there for everyone to watch . 
  what more do you want ? 
  [ top video . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34142512 ), 
   especially because they did the same in a video that was later published where they carefully edited out all the parts that showed the guy was acting . 
  oh really ? 
  [ top video . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34142512 ), 
   that 's straight up lying . 
  or he did n't have a good view of the incident . 
  which do you think is more likely ? 
  do you have any evidence of that ? 
   they are basically the state propaganda arm of the uk government . 
  give me a break . 
  are you aware that we have tory-led government ? 
  which do you think is more likely -- that the reporter lied in order to push a pro-migrant narrative , or that the reporter simply did n't have a very good view of the incident ? 
  [ the fact the the bbc corrected their own report ( 2:11 ) ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34142512 ) should tell you that it 's probably the latter . 
  what you described is not evidence that the bbc is a `` propaganda outlet '' . 
   crazy left wing perspective on immigration are we reading/watching the same bbc ? 
  i get the feeling this thread has been raided . 
   at this point she becomes an economic migrant , despite the ** bbc painting her as a refugee . 
  ** where ? 
  what evidence is there that he lied ? 
  it 's much more likely that he simply did n't have a good view . 
  [ the bbc even corrected the report . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jimgg/bbc_lying_about_hungarian_police_as_an_immigrant/cupp8hp ), 
  what evidence is there that the reporter is lying ? 
  what * incentive * is there for him to lie . 
  there are so many utterly delusional people in this thread . 
   most of them are completely unheard of in europe . 
  and yet still better known than the authors of any european country ( perhaps with the exception of britain ) . 
  what a moronic point . 
   from reddit you would think all euros do hate us . 
  rest assured that no community on reddit is representative of the general population . 
  when america is the subject of discussion , there 's an unbearable air of smugness that pervades this site ( particularly / r/europe ) . 
  for whatever reason , it 's fashionable to pretend that america contributes nothing of worth to the world . 
   american literature is like petrol station literature in sweden . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  considering the age of the country , america 's literary history is wonderfully rich . 
  / r/europe , everybody !, 
   i 'd rather deal with japan 's problems of an over-aging society i 'm really do n't think you would . 
  their economy is n't growing ( and likely never will again ) as the costs for supporting an ageing population go up every year . 
  it 's an absolutely terrible situation to be in . 
   you even get free water , no water bill !,
