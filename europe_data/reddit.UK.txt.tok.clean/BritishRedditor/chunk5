  how on earth can that zoo afford to keep running ? 
  for comparison , an adult ticket at edinburgh zoo costs # 17 ( 23.78 $ ) . 
   correct me if i 'm wrong , but you claim that homosexuality was never illegal in the uk ? 
  * homosexual acts * were illegal . 
  you were n't arrested for merely stating that you were gay . 
  it 's an important distinction , given the comment i was replying to . 
  you might want to read my comment again . 
  `` being gay '' has never been a crime . 
   ~ ~ iceland - red ~ ~  us - grey demonstrating nicely why prizes per capita is not a good measure scientific success . 
  edit : oops . 
  i did n't look carefully enough and just assumed that iceland 's 1 nobel prize was in science . 
  all that tells me is that you do n't know much about the british press ( or perhaps the press in general ) . 
  bias is expected of newspapers . 
  it 's just that some are worse than others . 
  what 's more , this is n't an example of bias . 
  surely something similar is done in german . 
  headlines are n't written in full sentences , are they ? 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  they use your email for that , not your name . 
   if you blindly accept friend requests without checking the profile it 's your own goddamn fault . 
  do you really think that the average facebook user is going to be at all suspicious about a friend request from someone whose name and picture is recognisable to them ? 
  i sure as hell am not . 
  how am i , an unsuspecting facebook user , meant to know that john smith , whose friend request i just accepted , is actually joe bloggs who wants to use my data for malicious purposes ? 
  i 'm 100 % behind facebook on this `` no fake names '' policy . 
  it 's way safer for everyone involved . 
  there 's nothing sinister about it . 
   they just want a way to put a name to the file , so their data aggregation is more complete , making the data they collect more valuable . 
  how does that make any sense ? 
  to facebook , you 're just a number . 
  advertisers could n't care less about your name . 
  [ 1966 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_fifa_world_cup ), 
  diet , mostly . 
  is that a joke ? 
  99 % of brits probably do n't even know what the elgin marbles are . 
   if we really want a united states of europe , then we need to help the downtrodden states , not crucify them . 
  you have it backwards . 
  the eu is * not * the united states of europe so there is no such expectation to save the `` downtrodden states '' . 
  hardly limited to reddit . 
   i 'm sure they are n't even `` close '' to being able to experience unbearable suffering . 
  i have no idea what you 're trying to say here , or how it 's relevant . 
  i 'm sure a 1 day old baby is also able to experience unbearable suffering . 
  my comment was in response to taedaetae who is confused as to why this proposal is considered controversial . 
  i can only assume he 's being deliberately obtuse . 
  are you serious ? 
  have you not read * any * of the arguments against your position ? 
  of course there 's going to be controversy when dealing with people whose brains are n't even close to fully developed . 
  seriously ? 
  language and culture are intrinsically linked . 
  when a language dies all the literature written in that language dies with it . 
   accept this violent attack or face expulsion !, 
  why do you even think that 's acceptable ? 
  i do n't . 
  i 'm just responding to [ your original comment . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39fhn0/legality_of_corporal_punishment_of_minors_in/cs3m52v ), 
   i do n't recall any kid ever being offered the choice to refuse the punishment they are n't offered a choice , but no teacher is going to physically force a child to endure a spanking . 
  the child can just refuse it and accept the consequences ( likely suspension/expulsion ) . 
  if you accept your punishment , you ca n't attack the teacher and then claim it was in self defence . 
  uh what ? 
  do you have any idea how corporal punishment in schools works/worked ? 
  why would a student fight the teacher administering the punishment ? 
  the student is n't strapped down . 
  he can just refuse the punishment . 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
  we 've won 5 times ( 1 more than the netherlands ) , putting us joint 2nd by total wins . 
   for protecting its citizens ? 
  who decides what that means ? 
  really ? 
  people are flying home to vote in the referendum ? 
  or are they just students finished with uni for the year ? 
  he means that many people who inherit a house from their parents end up having to sell it because they ca n't pay the tax . 
  how ? 
  if such a law would seriously harm his business , why on earth would he support it ? 
  just for future reference , that should be `` a brit '' . 
  `` british '' , `` french '' , `` spanish '' , `` dutch '' ( and probably some others i 'm forgetting ) are not used as singular nouns . 
  well , something is wrong . 
  those are non-fibre speeds . 
  you are not paying # 130 for just internet . 
  there 's no non-fibre deal that costs anything close to that in the uk . 
  how on earth does this effect you whatsoever ? 
  are you a terrorist that the government is trying to deport ? 
   hopefully this convinces labour to support proportional representation now . 
  why would they ? 
  fptp helps labour as well . 
  labour won * 355 * seats ( a comfortable majority ) in 2005 with only 35.2 % of the vote . 
  it 's certainly not complicated . 
  it 's as simple as elections systems come . 
  and that 's a problem . 
  you might want to look up the meaning of the word `` socialist '' . 
  even your biggest left-wing party describes itself as `` social-democratic '' . 
   yes , we are socialists who are you speaking for ? 
  because norway is not a socialist nation .

  i did n't realise there was any controversy surrounding this term until i checked the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_%28human_classification%29 ) for it a few minutes ago . 
  it 's used fairly casually in english , and always appears in non-discrimination statements ( `` we do not discriminate on the basis of race , sex , religion ... '' ) . 
  i 'm surprised there is n't an updated term for this ( although i have seen `` physical type '' ) . 
  the [ uk census uses `` ethnic group '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_census_2011#/media/file:2011_uk_census_ethnic_group_question.png ) , which is strange because technically that term does n't cover physical attributes . 
  for one thing , it lets you see whether parliament/government agencies/organisations etc. 
  are representative of the people they serve . 
  the metropolitan police has recently been on a drive to attract more black officers so that their numbers better reflect the demographics of london .
