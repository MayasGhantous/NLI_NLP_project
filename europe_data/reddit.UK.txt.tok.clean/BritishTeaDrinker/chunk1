for those interested , the plural is actually moose - same as the singular . 
  they put `` santa claus '' above `` father christmas '' in england ? 
  i hope that does n't mean `` santa claus '' is more popular . . 
  i was very confused until i realised you were n't talking about the country http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_lucia, 
   what may be funny in the anglo-american cultural environment hey now , let 's not imply that english and americans have the same sense of humour . 
  and no doubt you thought it would be quaint to buy it from the smallest , cheapest looking shop ? 
  yes , this is all making sense . . 
  pasties , fish & chips , etc. 
  are just convenience food and full english breakfast is a rare treat . 
  anyone who lives off that stuff exclusively * will * be very fat . 
   though generally their cuisine is bad i always wonder what foreigners mean by british `` cuisine '' - very little food here is deliberately marketed as `` british '' or `` traditional '' - if you deliberately avoid anywhere that sells any foreign or foreign-inspired dishes , i shudder to think of what establishments would be left over . . 
   british people of reddit , name this it appears to be a pair of buttocks made out of bread or cake . 
  just like the rest of the language . 
  getting away from the topic of food/fatness , i 'd like to point out that your version of the uk is just london - the tube is just for that city and there is nowhere near as much public transport in the rest of the country . 
   the only reason that they are n't as fat as us is that fewer of them own cars . 
  actually , it 's because we have sensible portion sizes . 
  the amount of food that it considered a one-person meal in america is very large - i 've seen it myself . 
   he told them he wanted to redo it from scratch more specifically , he wanted to stop making the [ difference engine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/difference_engine ) and start making the [ analytical engine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/analytical_engine ) . 
  london and the city of london are different cities , it 's just that the names are confusingly similar and one is directly in the middle of the other . 
   that 's how abducting works abducting means kidnapping . 
  i think you mean abdicating . 
  it would be easier to compare countries if you did it by percentages instead of just raw numbers . 
  this is also true of norse/germanic old religion , but as you say , it 's not all of them , it 's just that the idea was appealing to nationalists because it 's more specific to their region . 
  the headline says `` worship '' , but then the article says :  they do n't actually pray to zeus , hera and the others . 
  they see them as representations of values such as beauty , health or wisdom . 
  i know how to write `` portugal '' in many languages : * english : portugal * portuguese : portugal * spanish : portugal * french : portugal * dutch : portugal * german : portugal, 
  using correct french makes it an inaccurate quote . 
  quoting accurately makes it incorrect french . 
  it 's a lose-lose situation :(, 
  is it the british or american pronunciation of `` squirrel '' that is difficult ? 
  i imagine the american one is harder since it does n't seem to have any vowels . 
  south dakota is part of a country . 
  czech republic is a country . 
  forgotten the olympics already ? 
  hollande making fun of our initial weak medal count ? 
  then when we start doing well the french accuse us of cheating ? 
  did france do that to every country ? 
   britain invaded and pillaged my country , stripped its people of rights , forced us into a unitary state then told us to pay for famine relief entirely ourselves . 
  i 'd like to note that this was before all uk citizens were allowed to vote ... ... not that we have any good choices now , mind you . 
   its [ pretty clear ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zn0eg.png ) just try to remember this part : http://imgur.com/zlbgx, 
   well , perhaps this much chaos - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dagen_h#the_switch i doubt sweden in 1967 had the same amount of traffic as the uk in 2012 . 
  i have nothing against metric itself , i think it is well designed and i use it for various things , but the fact is that if we switch everything over , there are going to be idiots driving at 60 mph because the sign said `` 60 '' and people will get hurt and killed . 
  there 's also the problem that the government does n't employ enough people to switch all the road signs from mph to km/h at once , so some of the roads would be measured in mph while others were measured in km/h and people would have to know which roads were which . 
  maybe it 's maintained because changing speed measurements would cause a lot of chaos and preventing traffic accidents is more important than pleasing some people on / r/europe ? 
  does n't seem very environmentally friendly . 
  i can understand having lights on in fog and similar conditions , but surely if people ca n't see a huge , fast-moving metal object in clear weather they should n't be driving ? 
  12.4 % of the eu 's population . 
   should n't this be expansion , rather than explosion ? 
  yes . 
  actually / r/europe seems to be almost entirely about economics and the euro for some reason . 
  thankfully , there are exceptions , like this higg 's boson business . 
  i read recently that european colonialism was a reaction to the eastern trade routes being cut off by the ottoman empire . 
  so i guess if you want to prevent it , you 'll need to put send back some reinforcements for constantinople . 
  they do n't really have that ideological fanaticism like the republicans . 
  they just do whatever helps their rich buddies . 
  i 'd say one of the major differences is that the republicans use relentless rhetoric to make their ideas popular . 
  the tories just keep quiet about their less popular intentions . 
  we do like history and traditions ( when they 're harmless , anyway ) , i wo n't deny that . 
  i think a lot of us also enjoy pretending to care about historical issues more than we actually do , so i suppose a lot of our stereotype is our own fault in that way . 
  i agree that it should never be used against eu citizens , but . .  this army must never operate insight the eu territory . 
  would n't that make it rather ineffective at defence ? 
  it could handle counter-attacks but if an enemy managed to cross the border , any eu military chasing them would have to stop and hope the member states can handle it . 
  admittedly , an invasion is rather unlikely due to france and the uk 's nuclear deterrent . . 
  is it sometimes considered a country ? 
  could you elaborate please ? 
  the papers should just publish a list of things that do n't cause cancer . 
   so , to debunk that , i 'll point to a list of scottish inventions , and scottish universities - some of the best and oldest in the world .

  ~ winston churchill, 
  if we start judging countries their fanatical football fans , we 're all going to end up looking bad . 
  no problem , i just wanted to clarify . 
  of course , but i 'm talking about british-specific things on top of what you mentioned . 
  there 's something people occasionally say in the uk - the `` wartime spirit '' , referring to ww2 . 
  and it 's not talking about soldiers in combat , it 's talking about back home in britain ; where people had to `` keep calm and carry on '' despite the air raids , rationing , evacuation , the blackout , gas mask practice ... 
  it forced the country to work together to cope , it was an equaliser in many ways . 
  it ca n't be a coincidence that ( for example ) the national health service was introduced the very year after the war ended . 
  [ it 's not a misconception if it 's true . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tea_consumption_per_capita ), 
   `` do you really drink beer at school and the whole day ? '', 
  we did about 400 + years ago or thereabouts . 
  see , i can imagine a brit asking that as a joke ... but i can also imagine a less intelligent brit asking in earnest . 
   also , [ transylvania is not a country ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idtdq8btvrc ) neither are puerto rico , bermuda , tobago , san juan , french guiana , guam , sumatra , borneo , etc. . . it 's not a very accurate song . 
  the idea that we are `` obsessed '' with ww2 because we are living in past glories . 
  the real reason it is often in our minds is because it is seen a time in which the country pulled together to survive and overcome adversity . 
  in a sense , it was the birth of the modern britain , that separates us from what we think of as `` the olden days '' . 
  that 's my intepretation at least . 
   the englishmen should just stop making up names for other countries . 
  and i 'm sure you would n't dream of referring to france as `` frankreich '' instead of it 's local name ? 
  edit : ignore this , i was n't thinking clearly . 
  the posters that replied to me have some good points though .

  that 's because finnish was one of the main inspirations for tolkein 's elvish language . 
  relevant : [ metal around the world ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r_chzb2qns ), 
  the problem is the idea that because someone is a certain culture , they should live in a certain place . 
  people should be allowed to move around and mix together . 
  well , we never know when the atlantic ocean might attack . 
  1066 did not significantly change the demographics of britain , it was simply a battle to secure the throne . 
  the new king and his nobles were from normandy , but the general population remained the same . 
  leprecon was just counting the countries .
