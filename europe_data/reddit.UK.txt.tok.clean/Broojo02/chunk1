yes , this is dog . 
  yep , 16.6 % , http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/sn05871/youth-unemployment-statistics . 
  the uk is at 16.6 % atm . 
  http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/sn05871/youth-unemployment-statistics 20.5 % looked way too high . 
  not sure if someone in the comments can help me , but what is the source of this image ? 
  here is a map of solar power potential in europe : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/pvgis_europe-solar_opt_publication.png, 
  ranked 100th , bulgaria is the worst in the eu , crumbs . 
  this is a slightly larger version . 
  oh but scottish independence is totally the right thing to do , at least according to most of the people on r/europe who apparently love breaking up countries . 
  i look forward to the next 800 years of irish people revelling in any and all english butthurt then / s. 
  geez , all these angry comments about `` zero hours contracts '' on facebook and we really are n't even that bad . 
  british people just love to complain . 
  i too go on wikipedia . 
  furthest east i would consider would be turkey and the caucasus . 
  kazakhstan is very much asian . 
  best friends , frevaaar !, 
  ca n't wait for grass of europe !, 
  germany 1388 . 
  hours worked means sod all when people do n't work efficiently . 
  and yet , r/europe is pretty damn pro scottish independence . 
  aye , but not in eu . 
  overall the whole of europe gained 39 hdi points , good job guys :d here is a list of the countries that had a change in their hdi . 
  moldova : +6 ( 663 ) lithuania : +3 ( 834 ) romania : +3 ( 785 ) iceland : +2 ( 895 ) united kingdom : +2 ( 892 ) malta : +2 ( 829 ) latvia : +2 ( 810 ) montenegro : +2 ( 789 ) serbia : +2 ( 745 ) macedonia : +2 ( 732 ) bosnia and herzegovina : +2 ( 731 ) albania : +2 ( 716 ) norway : +1 ( 944 ) switzerland : +1 ( 917 ) sweden : +1 ( 898 ) liechtenstein : + 1 ( 889 ) austria : +1 ( 881 ) belgium : +1 ( 881 ) luxembourg : +1 ( 881 ) estonia : +1 ( 840 ) poland : +1 ( 834 ) slovakia : +1 ( 830 ) hungary : +1 ( 818 ) belarus : +1 ( 786 ) russia : +1 ( 778 ) bulgaria : +1 ( 777 ) ukraine : +1 ( 734 ) greece : -1 ( 853 ) ireland : -2 ( 899 ) cyprus : -3 ( 845 ) edit : the graph does n't include microstates so i 've added them in ( monaco and san marino missing from latest report , vaitcan not even considered ) . 
  also added in cyprus :(, 
  join romania . 
  there we have it , the uk likes to have the most fun . 
  it was just a petty beating :p, 
  thanks , obama . 
  congrats to munich :d, 
  i am in favour , it seems to make sense . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:presence_of_albanians_in_%22greater_albania%22.png however i do n't think support for it among kosovars is that great . 
  most kosovars just want regular independence , how boring :p, 
   and you do n't really occupy a place for 7 centuries . 
  try telling that to the irish :p, 
  the reasons/motives for the first world war were just like any of the other wars britain was involved in over the centuries , that of the national interest and honouring alliances , but on a much larger scale of course . 
  it was supposed to be ` over by christmas ' but turned out to be one of the deadliest conflicts in human history . 
  was this something the british government thought would happen beforehand ? 
  hindsight is everything . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_great_britain so many wars , who knows when one would become as large as ww1 ? 
  surprise empire !, 
  eddie izzard on stonehenge : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difq_nk8pe0, 
  6,000 years old ? 
  how the hell was this not better protected ? 
  i found this in an interview with the new statesman : `` he supports the abolition of the uk 's independent nuclear deterrent ( `` nuclear weapons are immoral '' ) as well as withdrawal from nato ( `` i 'd rather we were n't in it '' ) -- issues that contributed to the labour split in 1981 . '', 
  http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/jeremy-corbyn-interview-i-think-we-have-think-terms-disillusioned-who-didn-t-vote he also pledges to not spend the required 2 % of gdp on the military ( as part of nato ) . 
  so that would be seen as cutting defence as the current government is spending 2 % . 
  i 'm just gon na leave this here : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32332210 japanese cars most reliable , ford pretty good , german cars not so much . 
  well , they are only 7th in europe , not too bad :p https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate, 
  greece :, 
  poor moldova , can not even into wind energy . 
  sweet , my town just renovated some outdoor tennis courts . 
  any other banal news ? 
  [ bibury ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bibury&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=839&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=0qfqvewaoyhqulrsgyge&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag ), 
  yeah , let 's just scrap all money raising events and have days where we are encouraged to do nothing and simply `` give directly '' . 
  if only the world was run by people like you eh ? 
  what fun we would have ... 
  and raise about # 50m for charity , to `` show how cool they are '' . 
  also , weakening ? 
  yeah , most countries that are n't micronations have/once had different languages and ethnic groups . 
  conquering and unifying is a fundamental part of human history . 
  kinda like every country ever tbh :p, 
  and bomb proof bins . 
  ah indeed , i stand corrected . 
  denmark and the netherlands at their correct size . 
  european turkey ( east thrace ) is larger than slovenia . 
  very british :p https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles, 
  check out the kingdom of romania in 1890 : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/kingdom_of_romania_%281890%29.svg/1011px-kingdom_of_romania_%281890%29.svg.png, 
  indeed , we can only aspire to the glorious eastern european thinning hairline master race . 
  i pay # 3.50 for the privilege of having the same meal from a sandwich van that comes to my office . 
  you fuckers will upvote anything if it 's from a small eu country . 
  sealand, 
  and while we 're at it , a reduction in crime , increase in happiness and free puppies for all !, 
  what 's this ? 
  a higher number of comments than upvotes and people claiming the results are biased/inaccurate ? 
  uk on top ? 
  yep uk on top , nothing to see here , move along . 
  depends on which party i suppose . 
  all snp mps would vote against brexit . 
  labour mps despite overwhelmingly being pro remain themselves would probably be split 50/50 as a large number of their constituencies voted to leave . 
  conservative mps would mostly vote for brexit , there might be a few votes against in constituencies with both a pro-remain electorate and pro-remain conservative mp but there are n't many of those . 
  and 100 % of scottish constituencies voted to remain . 
  if they miss the target the bullet goes flying into another country . 
  op is a supporter of the [ european neighbourhood policy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_neighbourhood_policy ) :p, 
  i 'm all for building skyscrapers as they prevent urban sprawl and look nice at the same time but for a city as old as istanbul/constantinople with so many ancient buildings i can agree with them on this . 
  with that sort of money you really should have just bought a plane ticket :p, 
  sure we 'll get free roaming , for about 1.5 years ... 
  always a good site to visit : http://hastheuklefttheeuyet.com/, 
  so if we voted to remain and the uk population overtakes germany 's ( as is predicted ) would we still be `` ruled '' by germany even though we would have the most seats in the european parliament ? 
  the eu/greek government could always organise a scheme that lets syrians with a passport and all the necessary paperwork return home if they wish . 
  a bi-weekly plane trip for a small fee . 
  this is why i support a meritocracy . 
  although it should be said that while the cabinet members are indeed a bunch of ragtag elitists that are n't experts in their department , they have a team of people behind them that are . 
  http://i.imgur.com/z1hsfql.png in yellow : local districts that overall voted to remain in blue : local districts that overall voted to leave, 
  even if the eu halted all external immigration but still carried on with freedom of movement between it 's 28 member states inbreeding really would n't be a problem . 
  508 million people , free to move from country to country and start a family, 
  things are certainly uncertain . 
  you will find it difficult to find anyone in the uk who knows all of the meps for their local area , in the south east region there are 10 meps from a variety of parties . 
  i 'm not massively against there being an eu wide peace-keeping force , but other folk see it as an erosion of our independence . 
  the uk public in general does n't care about the amount of uk army spending , quite a few people want it to be increased , part of ukip 's manifesto was to build new aircraft carriers . 
  ah , i see he wants the uk to leave the eu .
