  yes !, 
  went to a bar that had loads of coronation street memorabilia which was ... odd, 
  damn ... thought you lot had it easier ... 
  those fucking yoda cunts need to be driven out of town, 
  i went to krakow last year on my own - lovely place . 
  i assumed it would be that other geezer ... the `` italian trump '', 
  italians eat * cats * wtf ?!? 
  nice one, 
  i mean ... [ hes not exactly a slim jim ] ( http://dailycandidnews.com/tag/fat-trump-trump-photo/ ) but yeah i guess if he was motor scooter fat it would be perfect, 
  aka a list of all his clients in case he gets caught . 
  something something republicans, 
  14 year old anarchist spotted, 
  it is not ... 
  itt : surprisingly few for the brits . 
  not sure if this means we inspire such antipathy that the insulting terms are ban-worthy and unrepeatably !, 
  glad you steered clear of some of the worse ones ... 
  hell , * i * might start using island monkeys - thats fucking brilliant, 
  hey cheers !, 
  just texted her - will let you know what she says !, 
  bad indian food is awful though, 
  my sister ( british ) moved to hamburg and is mortally disappointed in the lack of decent spice , of any kind . 
  first thing she does when she comes over is insist on a good curry/dhosa/thali, 
   violence against the us government in the name of the climate is acceptable . 
  it 's hot outside ... so lets riot ? 
  wtf, 
  yo , popey ... is that you ? 
  do it, 
  what happens after noon ? 
  anything offally [ like liver ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/liver_and_bacon_with_94841 ) for example, 
  i quite like it !, 
  [ is this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/asparagus_soup_spargel_66317 ) in anyway a traditional recipe ? 
  '' ... killll meee '', 
  ding ding ding we have a winner !, 
  it 's the nickname of one of myfriends . 
  i 'm waiting for him to come across it as he 'll be furious haha, 
  you pay less to the person selling until they die ? 
  i 'm confused how does this benefit the seller ? 
  you 're making these names up surely, 
  scrolls down ... please not us please not us ... oh, 
  rekt, 
  cricket is , toquote the ecb chairman `` the richest and more irrelevant sport in the country '' . 
  that 's pretty gross,

  cycle home then shower before bed, 
  how do you sleep if you finish dinner at 2300 ? 
  those dudes are going fucking nowhere, 
  agree - its fucking quality, 
  its such a miserable dirge though, 
  try getting a welshman or a scotsman to sing gstq ... haha see how long you have your teeth for, 
  tbh i think the americans are more obsessed with our royals than we are . 
  the ones near me in east london seem pretty fucking settled, 
  sorry this is bullshit , at least in europe . 
  you may be a gypsy as you claim to be but in europe they are one of the most insular minority groups . 
  you are american right ? 
  in europe , no one is allowed in , and they do n't work in the general community . 
  also a lot of themdo `` settle '' but it 's in their own communities ( usually tax free ) that no one else is allowed in, 
  ouch . 
  cricket is way better, 
  serious mancrush on nadal and juan mata . 
  you mean he absolutely dominated ? 
  because zlatan, 
  in short no one knows as nothing was ever planned . 
  in long , my opinion is that the maybot will continue to waffle inane platitudes all the while getting out manoeuvred by an eu that has all the leverage . 
  time will tick on and we 'll get left with no deals , and having to suddenly rush through some half way ill-thought out policies for eu citizens that pleases no one . 
  5,10 , 20 years down the line the unexpected consequences will spring up out of the woodwork, 
  hmm . . no its more like `` wuster-sheer '', 
   kuulilennuteetunneliluuk means `` hatch of the bullet pathway tunnel '' . 
  must be really commonly used right ? 
  ahem ... * cilantro = coriander * eggplant = aubergine * argula = rocket * zucchini = courgette * canola = rapeseed * scallions = spring onions * molasses = treacle * grits = semolina there 's probably more tbh, 
  embra is how irvine welsh spells it in some of his non fiction biographies, 
  and in exchange we give the world cricket !, 
  its a city entirely designed around corporations and cars , with people secondary . 
  it 's awful, 
  way longer than 50 years you need to check your facts, 
  it was fucking rank . 
  i would however recommend crickets - deep fried with garlic they 're kind of prawn like . 
  could honestly see them taking off . 
  another i regret eating is seahorse . 
  yeah i regret that, 
  both really . 
  if it tasted amazing , like say foie gras , then i would consider it . 
  i tell you what was the worst though - the tarantula . 
  i honestly felt like id been violated after eating its big bulb . 
  [ this you ? ], 
  ( https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920x1080/p02c7hxy.jpg ), 
  i guess from a western perspective we are a bit close to them in terms of them being domesticated so it did feel strange . 
  if other people want to eat them , no problems just not for me i guess . 
  why would hawaii leave - is there an independence movement going on or something ?
