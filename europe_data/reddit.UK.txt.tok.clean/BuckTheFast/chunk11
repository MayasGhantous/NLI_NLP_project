  now we 've got a wave of nationalist , populist nonsense all over europe with nothing more to say than `` it was better in the old days '' but because people are used to being angry and have been fed the `` eu as general-purpose but untouchable so-what-can-we-do '' scapegoat for years , these wafer-thin messages have hit home . 
  and now here we are , our politicians exposed as idiots and opportunists , undivided and publicly unwilling to act like adults and negotiate with each other , and meanwhile everyone 's still angry and the sun 's still brainwashing a generation to vote against their better interests . 
  do n't underestimate the importance of high-volume national infrastructure . 
  check a map of high-speed rail in europe sometime to see where the money goes . 
  bachelor of dental surgery ? 
  conservative , nationalist government promoting a conservative nationalist atmosphere * makes foreigners feel unwelcome ? 
   the support was and is so strong , that even very pro-eu government afraid of referendum on this question . 
  so how 's about a referendum for an independent dagestan and chechnya ivan ? 
  *** russia do n't ** do ** that ? 
  how shocking !, 
  i think your logic engine is missing a few gears there . 
   economic benefits never were the reason crimeans wanted to join russia and leave ukraine . 
    money is not what this is all about whatsoever . 
  if the russian living standards were three times lower ( on the level of ukraine ) then that would n't change a single thing for the regions wanting to return and reintegrate into it . 
  you can tell when a dude is middle-class * really * easy sometimes . 
  moral-free worldviews , available on every street corner . 
  to be quite frank we should * escalate * sanctions to hit the russian energy market which has been propping the economy up for 16 years , forcing big vlad to the table and insisting on a full and immediate withdrawal from the donbass with reparations paid to ukraine for the whole `` war '' thing . 
   well pardon my ignorance ... but do you happen to have a source to back that particular fact up ? 
  disregarding vetted sources because they defeat your political point is very bad form old bean . 
  the problem is that putin has shown he is willing to engage in nationalistic drum-beating regardless of the situation , so there 's really nothing to be gained for europe by removing the sanctions . 
  it 'll be hailed by the kremlin as a triumph for russia ( for some reason ) and then three months down the line putin will blame nato for stationing troops in poland and the baltics again . 
  there 's nothing for us to gain . 
   crimean people now think of themselves as victims of the western capitalism , as a part of some kind of twisted crimean siege with americans as besiegers . 
  victims of * capitalism ? 
  * how does that even work ? 
  well that and in a democratic system where new governments come in to replace the old ones they do n't like to be tied to a `` permanent '' commitment . 
  dictatorships obviously do n't have this problem , see belarus or , y' know ... that other place . 
  look out , chinese research facility # 36 , you 're on the hit-list !, 
  meanwhile / r/ukpolitics is hastily adding bill gates to *** the big brexit list of people or institutions we previously respected but now realize were actually shit all along , *** including but not limited to : * the bank of england * the british school of economics * the international monetary fund * the city of london * every major worker 's union * the president of the united states * the former leader of the opposition * the current prime minister but they 've got a newfound respect for supporters of britain leaving the eu such as * marine la pen * donald trump * vladimir putin * and that guy who shot jo cox now if one of those lists look decidedly more worth listening to than the other one ( and , presumably , it 's the longer one ) that might just be because you 're sane , in which case please stick around for voting day . 
  if however you 're a bigger fan of the smaller list , well , / r/ukpolitics is pretty much already yours anyway . 
  unionists prefer to pretend that ireland is some far off exotic place , i 'd imagine they 'd happily vote for a massive trump-style wall all along the border . 
  and westminster decides what eu money stormont gets . 
  unfettered capitalism led to the global financial recession . 
  as a left-winger , nope . 
  interesting that in northern ireland the vote is split along nationalist/remain and unionist/leave lines . 
  indeed , they should be escalated to reflect their obvious lack of incentive to return ukraine to it 's pre-invasion status quo . 
  bloody right , too . 
  why should we take these hits at all ? 
  please continue presuming everyone else is stupid , it 's worked so well for you so far . 
   nice assumption , please tell me where i said which side i was on ?? 
   remember everyone only the brexit side fear monger ...  brexit havent said staying would cause ww3 or the collapse of western civilisation which is proberly the most blatant scare mongering its possible to do  remain voter 2016 well that did n't take long . 
  but nigel farage and the leave campaign told me they were definitely going to join !, 
  someone please , explain to me what happened !, 
   remember everyone only the brexit side fear monger ... 
  if you do n't want people to make assumptions about you then do n't post anything . 
  even better , grow some thicker skin . 
  if the russian government is actually sponsoring this to achieve a specific purpose i think they 've underestimated how willing footie fans are to have a fight . 
  i 've seen brexit campaigners lie about this * constantly * with no shame . 
  when your entire campaign has us giving up *** everything *** for *** nothing , *** that 's pretty fucking scary . 
  that 's why we have to tell you about it again and again , because you think if you repeat `` we 've got no plan '' again and again people will hear `` we 've got a plan . '', 
  and the remain campaign is aware of that . 
  the leave campaign is being swept along by guys supported by marine la pen , donald trump and big vlad putin . 
  oh my god . 
  wow it 's eerily similar to today . 
  it even has the orange order supporting them . 
  eddie izzard was never going to appeal to the pint-drinking , head-shaving , football-jersey-everday-wearing johnny brexit crowd , but he did come of as a bit of a crazy person anyway . 
  corbyn though , corbyn has a lot to answer for with his complete absence on this . 
  people like farage are true believers , happy to drink the kool-aid and flop on the floor like fishes . 
  corbyn has been very mercenary about this whole debacle . 
  and when i go into / r/ukpolitics people will still be defending this shit . 
  lord help me there are some dumb motherfuckers in this country . 
  you do n't know what that phrase means , and that 's okay , but you really have to stop using it now . 
  good old nigel `` huge fucking jackass who i wish would piss the fuck off back to his bigoted privileged background '' farage . 
  how i wish that were true . 
  in fact this referendum is going to see the opposite , as this is leave 's passion project and all the furrow-browed skinheads are going to knuckle their way down to the voting booths while regular people check to see if it 's raining . 
  wonderful . 
  can you source that quote for me ? 
  i 'd love to nail someone with it . 
  yes the president is a cunt . 
  ours fucks pigs . 
  are you worried about the president or the people ? 
  that 's what he explicitly said but i 'm rather concerned that he had to say this publicly because his own party is in this article promoting the idea of evicting all of them , permitting them only to stay for a `` transitional period . '', 
  it 's almost like the conservative pan-european trend of scapegoating the eu for all their woes is a flawed tactic that is finally forcing the politicians to reap what they sewed . 
  the people have never been a champion of * anything . 
  * there was a massive protest against abolishing slavery for years * after * it was abolished . 
  ** ( richard aoyade voice ) ** i 've got a gun !, 
  i 've got a flipping gun !, 
  haha , oh you sweet summer child . 
  nevermind there 's nothing wrong with these countries , this leaflet is indicative of how factually groundless the entire leave campaign has been . 
  they kind of rubberstamped that yesterday when our biggest tabloid rag , * the sun , * puppet piece of disgraced billionaire rupert murdoch , came out in full support of leave . 
   lol you seem more butthurt than some of the russians . 
  where did putin touch you ? 
  this is like every other post you make . 
  nice to know our football fans are n't public enemy number 1 for a little while . 
   even nigel farage said we would n't be deporting any eu migrants . 
  i 'll need a source on that one , chief . 
  do n't doubt what a campaign backed by nigel farage , marine la pen , donald trump , vladimir putin and the sun thinks it can do . 
  if it thought it 'd further their political goals they 'd start telling people that the welsh were lizard people from the planet sporkblar . 
  i 'm just going to drink myself into a coma until voting day so i do n't have to see anymore stories about brexit that just make me feel ashamed . 
  good grief . 
  i 'll do you one better than that - [ the very people who wrote that report later washed their hands of it , calling it historical whitewashing of russia 's involvement . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war#international_monitors ), 
   no one believes russia was the aggressor in the georgian war . 
  no-one apart from the people who wrote the eu report on it . 
  you 're one of the most prominent leave campaigners on this subreddit . 
  you 're taking a note from farage and banking on everyone being too stupid to realize this . 
  good luck . 
  because you get sick of leave ignoring hard facts and opinions in favour of emotional nonsense . 
  i 'm sorry , do you think those are footballers ? 
  you 'll have to try to speak english .
