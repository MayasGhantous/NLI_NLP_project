  it 's a / u/muyuu thread , he 's going to find whatever he can to make it seem like every country hates us . 
  they are literally the core brexit voters , along with oaps terrified of losing their inglishness . 
  well , duh . 
   did n't know ireland is slavic ah , a chance to view a russian education up close !, 
  what treasures it has already revealed !, 
  invading a neighbouring country because you view them as sub-human . 
  hashtag slavic `` brotherhood '', 
  no i mean europe , formerly the greatest continent in the world before the russian people did to the eastern half of it what they do on a daily basis to russia ( read : corruption , economic collapse , judicial unaccountability , breakdown of laws , fascism , militarism , jingoism , utter financial mismanagement , infrastructural decline - * but * two toilets in every stall ! ) . 
  we 're fixing that now though . 
  that 's why people in krakow make more than you and people in riga live better than you . 
   but russian drills are not the biggest too , wonder what indian or chinese or american looks like . 
  it would actually be really interesting if anyone could provide similar info on indian and chinese military exercises for the sake of comparison . 
   a quite intellectually dishonest piece . 
  the second biggest russian exercise listed , vostok-14 , happened in the far east , along chinese and japanese borders . 
  who knows how many more of the exercises had nothing to do with europe . 
  a chart on military exercises is dishonest because it listed military exercises ? 
  what ? 
  it 's not quite at nigeria levels where they had to [ invent a word ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prebendalism ) to explain the massive , institutionalized extent of the corruption , but it 's up there and it seems to be utterly impossible for russia to shake off like the rest of europe has done or is attempting to do . 
  we 're slowly fixing the half of europe that you guys ruined for 50 years , yeah . 
  it 's gon na take a while though , the russians were * very * bad at running countries . 
  putin has become louis xiv , the sun king . 
  what 's russian for `` i am the state ? '', 
  well yeah , i 'm british . 
  it 's our thing . 
   b ) we have the longest border in the world . 
  total 61000km ( 22000km is by land ) neighbouring 18 countries . 
  feel free to compare these numbers with the top spender and others . 
  finland , estonia and azerbaijan must scare the absolute shit out of the average russian then . 
   what was your point btw ? 
   what does sound bad on the other hand is having one of the largest military budgets in the world at $ 70 billion and constantly increasing it , whilst your elderly live on $ 4 a day . 
  i 'm not sure why you needed someone to repeat this to you . 
  whereas brexit voters prefer to be intolerant of immigrants and the nefarious * johnny belgian * who they tell us is controlling westminster , i prefer to be intolerant of ignorant bigots who plan to cause major damage to my country by forcing it out of a massively beneficial union for us . 
  well obviously . 
  only the delusional ninnies who actually * vote * for brexit will assume otherwise . 
  presumably because of the brain damage . 
   the only difference i believe is western citizens also benefit from their corrupt politicians we do ? 
  how ? 
  or even better , if we stay and rub it in the face of parasitic scum like marine la pen , donald trump and vladimir putin . 
  politics 101 is hard , is n't it ? 
  nigel farage and the brexit lads strangely absent from this discussion . 
  boom , that 's the way to do it . 
  oh god i 'm so happy it was you that responded in earnest to satire because it was performed with a straight face . 
  as was almost every poll for every nation 's entry * into * the edifice in the first place . 
  * ( deep , cleansing breath ) * it 's * satire . 
  a farthing everytime someone links this satirical piece in earnest . 
  have you heard about this thing called `` brexit '' ? 
  it 's the revolutionary idea that you can blame all your problems on the influence a body that exercises minimum control over your life as long as you do n't prove exactly what they 're doing wrong . 
  oh he is just a treasure . 
  well , i hope none of your wants ever come to pass . 
  see you . 
  who 's this `` we '' ? 
  did you forget you also just advocated for `` yugoslavia '' to leave as well or is this just not your day ? 
  i 'm struggling to see how turkey is negotiating from a position of strength here considering his endless political fuck-ups , his authoritarianism , his shooting down of jets and all of * waves hands dramatically * this . 
  repeating the word `` immigrants '' does n't cover that . 
  thanks but no thanks . 
  i 'd rather we not damage our country because of misplaced nationalistic fervor and scapegoating of johnny belgian . 
  join the club . 
  * ( politely indulgent smile not at all masking overwhelming cynicism on this service ) *, 
  er , we 're not voting out . 
  we 've established [ elsewhere in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4mvrg7/nato_countries_begin_largest_war_game_in_eastern/d40zey3?context=3 ) that you do n't see anything that casts russia in a negative light , so rather than watch you stumble around blindly bumping into things in the modern world i 'm just going to stop talking to you . 
  yeah i 'm dealing with a guy who sees the words * `` simulated attacks '' * and * `` practised using weapons from it 's nuclear arsenal '' * and says he just sees a blank page . 
  i 'm pretty much done with him . 
  you know who never get enough protection are crooked old white multi-millionaire pedophiles with ties to the mafia . 
   how about we stop making assumption we know what 's going to happen . 
  that 's literally the role of government . 
   the last few times eu have intervened somewhere it resulted in an absolute and total disaster and hundreds of thousands dead . 
  okay , source that conjecture . 
   how about we stop treating other nations and people as inferior and unable to solve their own problems ? 
  western military force has been a welcome and stabilizing power in that region for years by every party apart from the aggressor . 
  how about people who are new to political discourse stop projecting racial and ethnic prejudices when their practical arguments fall short ? 
  right now i 'm wondering whether you 've got a rare visual defect where you ca n't see the phrase *** `` the russian air force practised using weapons from its nuclear arsenal . 
  [ ah , so you 're one of the few people who were n't aware that the creators of that report * themselves * recanted it , calling it a whitewashing of history ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war#eu_fact_finding_mission ), 
   the russian air force practised using weapons from its nuclear arsenal , while in the russian enclave of kaliningrad , which neighbours poland , red army forces stormed a `` polish '' beach and attacked a gas pipeline . 
  the language of the aggressor in a war against a peaceful ally . 
  here 's a hint : the original post does n't have * parent * under the text . 
  * this * is the original post :  nato is taking more and more hostile actions against russia . 
  war games , missiles , attacking russian spheres of influence like ukraine and syria ... 
  i 'm afraid of results of all this warmongering ... aaaand yours :  latin america is , though . 
  discussion over . 
  yeah , sure . 
  of course you did . 
  the original thread was about russia 's `` sphere of influence '' ( a ludicrous term in itself for many reasons ) which you then hijacked to posit that `` latin america '' was the us 's sphere . 
   and on a few hundred years of implementing that policy . 
  that 's the kind of assertion where you 'll have to prove that each presidential administration reaffirmed and executed this policy . 
   you are starting to seriously deviate from the reality . 
  am i seriously talking to someone who 's denying that russia invaded georgia , sponsored the rebels in abhkazia and south ossetia and directly acted to maintain a frozen conflict for two decades ? 
  is that seriously who i 'm talking to right now ? 
  i 'm ctrl + fing as hard as i can but i still ca n't seem to find the word `` unsubstantiated '' anywhere in that article . 
  of course that article itself makes several unsubstantiated assertions , including that matthew day did n't write the headline , which it fails to cite . 
  furthermore , the original report directly states that russia and belarus simulated attacks on poland :  the manoeuvres are thought to have been held in september and involved about 13,000 russian and belarusian troops . 
   poland , which has strained relations with both countries , was cast as the `` potential aggressor '' . 
   the documents state the exercises , code-named `` west '' , were officially classified as `` defensive '' but many of the operations appeared to have an offensive nature . 
   the russian air force practised using weapons from its nuclear arsenal , while in the russian enclave of kaliningrad , which neighbours poland , red army forces stormed a `` polish '' beach and attacked a gas pipeline . 
  * [ response that is also so broad it is essentially meaningless ] *, 
   iraq which they were condemned for , which their own citizens and media protested and made *** major movies against , *** which they *** did n't annex *** and which they spent *** years and billions of dollars to rebuild . 
  *** none of which russia did in ukraine or georgia . 
   afghanistan which they were condemned for , which their own citizens and media protested and made *** major movies against , *** which they *** did n't annex *** and which they spent *** years and billions of dollars to rebuild . 
  *** none of which russia did in ukraine or georgia . 
   yugoslavia which they did to prevent a genocide , which they spent billions on and years in to help rebuild , and half of whose members are now in the eu .
