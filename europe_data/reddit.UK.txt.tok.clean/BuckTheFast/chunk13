  none of which russia can claim . 
  absolutely ignorant and intellectually dishonest spin . 
  shame on you . 
   you , perhaps , noticed i linked a uk royal institute of international affairs paper saying that the whole story was unsubstantiated ? 
  it does n't say that anywhere in the article . 
  and you can just call them chatham house . 
  we know who they are . 
  whereas despite what chatham said in their report day explicitly states that poland were cast as the aggress which russia and belarus simulated joint attacks on . 
  the things that you 're saying are dumb , and i 'm going to ignore you when you say them . 
  welcome to the block list !, 
  sovreignty , immigration , are jobs . 
  and a basic misunderstanding of how the eu is run and the uk 's influence in it peddled and abused by tabloid rags and investments from trustworthy sources like the kremlin . 
  it 's telling that this is a telegraph article . 
  when the most shamelessly pro-brexit paper in the country is reporting on this you know there 's cause for worry . 
  of course it 's too late by now , the bed is made . 
   whataboutism . 
  that is * literally * how you started this tangent . 
   1823-2013 of public policy `` south america is our sphere of influence '' is not bad at all . 
  you 're literally basing that on a ) the creation of the policy by the president in the 1820s and b ) a vice-president referencing it as being done nearly years later . 
  does n't quite compare to russia * actually * invading non-aggressive ally georgia 8 years ago and non-aggressive ally ukraine 2 years ago , does it ? 
  it 's telling that every russian apologist can only point to incidents from the early cold war era . 
  or , in this case , the early 1800s . 
  that 's a more damning response when you are able to provide examples of problems with the eu that your campaign is backing . 
  because context and history illustrates how russia 's lack of rapprochement with it 's former client-states and inability to shrug off the yolk of corruption has given birth to it 's modern climate which you have attempted to blame entirely upon those former states and their new allies . 
   russian spheres of influence teenager spotted . 
   you are not offering any argument besides `` trust our reporting since we have sources '' . 
  the sources on the russian simulated nuclear attack on poland are open and public . 
  you 're literally asking us to take your word that they 're lying . 
  that 's not going to convince anybody . 
   i 'd like to see how they behave when we stop trying to wind them up every chance we get . 
  the only way this statement makes sense is if you clicked the wrong flair . 
  attachment to the idea of a greater european body is often particularly strong among people in countries with longstanding problems with corruption or what-have-you . 
   i think the problem with this argument is the use of a the nazis as a bogeyman . 
  it 's a thought-terminating cliche . 
  dictatorships and autocracies exist everywhere , and they 're not all nazis . 
  of course it 's not good . 
  there 's also the other side of this coin which is becoming more and more prevalent where an argument is dismissed out of hand because of a reference to the third reich . 
  it 's not always intellectually honest to dismiss something because it godwin 's a thread . 
  i 'm not saying you 're doing that here to be clear , it 's correct to say that universally equating ultranationalist dictatorships with the nazis is dishonest , but it 's important to be aware of not overusing that position . 
   it is not like we did n't have an opportunity to resolve the ukrainian problem before it escalated to this point . 
  it is also not like we are innocent of invading neighbouring ( and faraway ) countries . 
  there 's no excuse for this in the modern day . 
  do n't try and diminish the sheer absurdity of russia invading and annexing it 's closest ally . 
  during * peacetime , * no less . 
  while i agree with you and will continue to support the long-term creation of an organized , unified european army , complete with a unified command structure , information sharing and an enormous recruitment bed and supply policy , that 's a long-term project that 's decades away . 
  that first sentence is breaking apart under a barrage of punctuation . 
   strange . 
  i could have sworn that the swedish , norwegian , polish , lithuanian etc trade with the eu has been growing all the time without russia annexing anything . 
  dude , you only need to fuck one goat to get a reputation as a goat-fucker . 
  there 'd be very little to fighting russia . 
  i assume your referring to russia 's energy contracts with europe , which russia absolutely needs or it 's economy collapses . 
  if putin loses the war the next guy in line still has to do business with europe . 
  aside from this the eu has stockpiled months of gas for emergencies exactly like this . 
  a threat that you wo n't use is no threat at all . 
  if i were you i 'd head west then . 
  your english is obviously good enough that emigration to somewhere in the west would n't be an issue . 
  ah , here we are talking about worst-case scenarios . 
   is europe caving into america 's paranoia or is there a genuine threat to europe from russia ? 
  it 's an obvious concern to our eastern members given their history and russia 's recent escapades in georgia and ukraine , and for the rest of us when stuff is revealed like moscow directly funding far-right anti-eu movements ( what 's up , marine la pen and ukip ? ), 
  yeah i can understand why it 's a serious concern for all of the former soviet and wp states . 
  it 's a different age now though , the old bear is n't what he used to be . 
  i 'm sure that sounds shallow coming from someone as remote as i am but this is an alliance we 're committed to for the betterment of all of us , and we 'll do our part to ensure that our member states are n't threatened again . 
  i seriously doubt in this theoretical invasion that russia has either the capability or the intent of making romania their objective as well as more severe and local threats in poland/germany , particularly when nato controls the black sea . 
  how about we help regulate a powder keg before it explodes rather than making clumsy allusions to the un-mandated intervention in libya ? 
  i 'm sure we 'd be welcomed in by everyone but china for helping to stabilize the region , just as the us is viewed for it 's role there . 
  stopping gas-supplies to europe would bankrupt the russian economy almost overnight , while we have months of gas already stockpiled in the worst-case scenario . 
  europe has put the russian economy on it 's back for decades now , and putin knows this . 
  i thought you were romanian ? 
  er , no without nuclear weapons this would be an * extremely * one-sided war . 
  the us alone has * both * largest air forces on the planet . 
  that 's a weirdly dumb burn . 
  we 've got our own nuclear deterrents . 
  that 's where he 's correct . 
  what he feels to address is russia 's continued promotion of instability through frozen conflicts , sponsoring insurgencies and outright invasions of it 's neighbours and `` allies . '', 
  the simple fact of the matter is that the putin administration is a relic and will not see foreign opinion on russia shift while they are in power . 
  russian posters are welcome to then come in and say `` that 's fine , we do n't care about foreign opinion . '', 
  except obviously you do , because your government is making statements to that effect . 
  would n't it be great if he died , the horrible little shit . 
  it 's legitimately to do with one half of us hating the other half and that pettiness and bigotry resulting in a second-class style of life for everybody . 
   ni had a bad history of postal voting fraud/voting fraud in general at the turn of the century from sinn fein voters . 
  i 'm going to go right ahead and ask for a source on that . 
  everyone who has a law degree within the uk , including myself , has the option of several courses in eu law , and your understanding of it is both faulty and quite visibly prejudiced towards your narrative . 
  allright , give us an example if you like . 
  it 's allright to be critical of such a large and important organization , but to leave it when it 's so beneficial for us based upon such nonsensical reasoning as brexit is peddling is just bananas . 
   you referred to people voting to leave the eu as ` pants-on-head ' , and i 'm the one being reductionist ? 
  i referred to the brexit campaign as `` pants-on-head '' and then listed why . 
  you just wanted to handwave away the very obvious problems of the campaign . 
   and there we go , you spend the rest of the comment confirming what i 'd said . 
  and lo and behold , rather than dealing with these massive , glaring holes in your campaign you try and handwave them away . 
  ah , straight to the reductionist argument . 
  who could have predicted that ? 
  it 's more a `` brexit is based upon a misunderstanding of existing legislation , a misunderstanding of how our own government works , a thinly-veiled fear of *** the others *** who are coming to take our jobs/houses/way of life away , a consummate reputation for ignoring advice from everyone from the british school of economics to the bank of england to the president of the united states ( but have fans in marine la pen and donald trump ) a non-existant economic plan going forward which speaks * volumes * about their commitment to the betterment of the united kingdom and a general lack of ability to substantiate ** any ** of their arguments beyond the emotional level . '', 
  kind of thing . 
  well no , it 's just that now i 'm left holding this severed arm ... 
  oh , fair enough . 
  what , you mean iraq where the empire of evil spent years and trillions of dollars rebuilding before leaving the place ? 
  or saudi arabia , where [ foreign invasion not detected ] ? 
  i mean , that 's assuming we 're not looking at first world countries because would n't * that * look bad ? 
  in a shocking twist , the thief is ex-pope and former junior nazi benedictus who believes the blood will make him just as popular as his predecessor . 
  while i 'm optimistic about common sense prevailing , the problem for remain is that our voters will be much less energized that the pants-on-head brexit crowd .
