  hopefuly over the coming weeks the campaign does everything it can to get voters out from their ethnic takeaway of choice and actually vote . 
   so they would ignore the results of the referendum ? 
  are they trying to cause riots ? 
  this is n't france . 
  we 'd just stew privately in our juices . 
  anything that pisses off the sun and daily mail readers is fine by me . 
  is this ... good news ? 
  here , you dropped this : \\, 
  there 's that oft-repeated one about it still being legal to shoot a welshman with a longbow if you find him within the city walls of chester after midnight , but i think qi might 've taken aim at that one at some point . 
   it is obvious that this is for internal consumption . 
  this is n't the least bit surprising and i ca n't imagine there 's a piece of paper anywhere in ankara detailing a plan to hold germany accountable for these incidents . 
   unless israel is involved , if it is , then this ` need for accountability ' disappears i 'm so confused . 
  okay , let me give you all my professional opinion from my years of watching television : if you ever find yourself in an argument where you 're talking about blood or racial purity , stop , take a deep breath , and then talk fully and confidently about who your overwatch waifu is instead . 
  he 's virtually a gimmick account at this point . 
  he 's one of several regulars who just espouse pro-kremlin verbiage any chance they get . 
  it 's also on psg 's crest so , y' know , football . 
  what 's a cbd ? 
   why it should be other way ? 
  i know we 're talking about russia and so you 're going to fly the party flag no matter what we 're talking about , but there 's also the option of rebuilding a city that you turned into what was literally described as `` the most devastated city on the planet '' * without * taking that opportunity to establish an oppressive authoritarian stranglehold over the people who you just blew into smithereens . 
  you do n't have to build a giant statue to islam either , you could just * rebuild * the place . 
  just an idea . 
  goddamn , that 's some emotional prose . 
  it 's not so much that , poland * did * invade the former czechoslovakia ( for whatever reason , i 've no opinion on that ) before the war which was used by some apologists as excusing their invasion . 
  poland 's larger problems involved being unlucky with it 's neighbours and unlucky in it 's leaders and military escapades to the extent where despite being * relatively * populous and industrialized it could n't withstand it 's belligerent neighbours . 
  that and to be quite honest we did n't do enough to help them . 
  a lot , but not enough . 
   do n't claim to be a right-winger while denying the problems in sweden . 
  watching you try desperately to find a consistent position for yourself is delightful . 
  i know this dude from civilization 5 !,

  *** bonfire intensity increases ***, 
  that 's the problem with brexit ; everyone who is n't voting for them is an outsider . 
  that 's what you get with a platform built on prejudice and ignorance . 
  good lord he 's linking to zero hedge . 
  that 's what we call brexit over here , and their shameless treating of anyone not-british as an antagonistic alien who want to take advantage of us . 
  it 's going to be very important for all of us to get out there and vote to make sure this ludicrous , damaging agenda is stopped here . 
  you 're aware that chinese naval vessels will be training in the med this year ? 
  fuck me you 'd have been useful in world war 1 or 2 . 
  good idea . 
  a positive and cooperative mission in a region of the world that needs a lot of regulation . 
   then why can eu courts attempt to overturn the democratically elected government of my country ? 
  they ca n't and they 're not . 
   1 . older voters do remember the united kingdom as it was before it joined the european union , and it was n't as bad as the european union 's supporters make it out to be . 
  they know there 's a world outside the yoke of the political union . 
  remain voters never painted us before our membership of the eu as `` bad , '' that 's a bit disingenuous . 
  our language is couched in the context of the modern day , which is centred on the issue that we 'd be giving up a great swathe of benefits and damaging our political and economic ties with our most important partners for no solid gain . 
  that being ** said , ** britain in the 70s pre-eu was in the grips of major recession and for decades before that had been growing at a slower rate than the rest of western europe . 
  if older voters are recalling those days fondly it 's not because of economic prospects . 
   2 . older voters may have been old enough to vote in the previous referendum , and often feel betrayed if they voted to remain then . 
  that 's possible , however [ the previous eu referendum passed with two thirds of all votes going to join . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum,_2016#history ) older voters have little to feel betrayed about considering the government was acting in concert with the sentiments of the country . 
   they voted for a trade bloc with very limited political powers , but now the highest level of government for the united kingdom is located outside of the united kingdom no , it is n't . 
  that 's just completely and utterly wrong . 
   3 . older voters went to school ( and , in some cases , university ) at a time when the european union barely - if at all - influenced the curriculum . 
  speaking as a 22-year-old , i have been raised from the very start of my education to support the european union and to consider it both a given and a positive . 
  okay this is getting silly . 
  i , my entire family and group of friends and their respective circles grew up with a uk that was a core port of the eu and we were never `` raised to very start to support the eu and to consider it both a given and a positive . '', 
  politicking of any sort is not allowed in british national curriculums : if they are n't teaching us that thatcher was a saint they sure wo n't be telling us that the eu is . 
  nobody is accusing the brexit argument of making sense . 
  old voters have trended conservative since the beginning of voting records . 
   because you need to base it on something and that has been the minsk agreement . 
  you also just factually have an ethnic russian majority in crimea . 
  i 'm not going to repeat myself about minsk . 
  the ethnic make-up of crimea is irrelevant to the legality of an invasion , and more irrelevant to sending a message about that legality . 
   these things are not directly connected . 
  you wo n't get that funding to stop if you impose further sanctions . 
  you certainly wo n't get the states bordering us more stabilized like that you rather destabilize the situation by destabilzing the russian government . 
  it does not matter if i do n't like putin , we have to make the situation work with him . 
  indeed it does . 
  we pressure an issue where previously we have n't pressured anything . 
  the goal of this is not to work with putin . 
  the goal is to have our aims reached . 
  this is the withdrawal of russian armed forces from their occupation in ukraine . 
  i do n't care about putin 's opinion on this . 
  that 's why it 's necessary to make the change necessary through effective sanctions . 
   the worst case scenario is a nuclear war . 
  the issue is not that it might be impossible for europe to handle it , but that it is pretty scary to punsh a person in the face that has a gun pointed at your head . 
  we ca n't just sweep into russia and defeat it . 
  cornering russia is risking war in my oppinion . 
  the worst case scenario is always nuclear war . 
  we still have to build the world we want to live in . 
  putin is not going to do it for us . 
   this is not our land . 
  there is war in ukraine and as far as i am aware there are no military alliances with ukraine . 
  i think we just fundamentally disagree what `` make sure that we will protect ourselves and our interests '' means . 
  if that was the goal and not about morality it seems like the rational consequence would be to drop crimea . 
  europe is our land . 
  it 's necessary for us to protect the sanctity of the laws and the peace of that land so that people like putin do not see opportunities like ukraine and georgia ever again . 
  it is our duty as people lucky enough to live in a place that values the rule of law and the defence against injustice to protect our neighbours who look to us for help . 
   so you draw a hardline and then what ? 
  it is a fact that europe is not willing to stage a military intervention in ukraine against russia , not willing to risk ww3 and rightfully so in my oppinion . 
  we draw a hard line and then the line is observed and we continue on has he wave been before . 
   right , but that still does n't mean that this would not reinforce that ? 
  is n't the ultimate goal to have good relations with russia and the russian people again ? 
  no , it 's to have our goals achieved , which is peace , order , observance of the law , human rights and free and open trade bringing europe closer together . 
  that is what the european union is about . 
  it is necessary to define ourselves by our strong stances as much as our compromises , otherwise we allow people like putin to flourish . 
  we are as much to blame for his rise to power as anyone . 
   and because moscow is escalating conflicts we ca n't escalate conflicts ourselves ? 
  that makes no sense .
