  and if i am completely honest i do value peace more than a little peninsula in the black sea full of ethnic russians . 
  you 've confused yourself . 
  i 'm advocating a strong stance and an escalation of the sanctions . 
  you appear to have flip-flopped between advocating appeasement and now attacking me for ** not ** advocating escalation . 
  i am in favour of a clear , strong message . 
   and if i am completely honest i do value peace more than a little peninsula in the black sea full of ethnic russians . 
  thomas jefferson would tell you `` he who would trade a little liberty for a little security deserves neither and would lose both . '', 
  and georgia . 
  but yeah , we 'll wait for the smoke signals . 
  well done germany . 
  welcome to the club - wait , what ? 
  we have n't done this yet ? 
  i guess we 're just lucky that ireland is n't a militaristic dictatorship destabilizing the countries it borders . 
  shock horror , nick clegg has no integrity . 
   as far as i am aware the critical part so far has been the minsk agreement and that does not include returning crimea to ukraine . 
  the minsk agreement relates to the donbas exclusively , why would that dictate our approach to the sanctions ? 
  russia 's actions in ukraine are not restricted to the donbas and the minsk agreement ** certainly ** does not do enough to address that . 
   yes , but that does not mean that these countries do not still rely on russian gas . 
  germany may get more than half its gas from the netherlands and norway , but that still leaves a rather large chunk we get from russia . 
  indeed it would n't be painless , but the alternative is allowing a militaristic dictatorship destabilize our borders ( as he 's doing ) and sponsor nationalist anti-eu political groups ( as he 's doing in everyone from la pen to trump 's advisors ) . 
   and europe depends on russia . 
  to a much smaller degree . 
  at some point europe will be forced to declare what it stands for and we currently have a swathe of politicians kicking the can down the road . 
   and even if europe could stomach sanctions there 's no * if , * that 's completely disingenuous of you . 
  the worst case scenario is the russian economy and state collapses which brings it 's own set of problems , not that europe 's massive , stable economy with trading partners on every corner of the earth could stand sanctioning russia gas and oil exports . 
   the goal has to be a compromise and foremost safety . 
  no , it does n't . 
  the goal has to be a statement that this is not 1916 and that europe will not allow belligerency on it 's borders . 
  this is our land and we need to make sure hostile states make sure that we will protect ourselves and our interests . 
  this is a major problem today , an abject inability to draw a hardline in the sand . 
  jingoistic quasi-dictators like putin have made a living taking advantage of precisely that good faith , and we are lessoned by it . 
   it also creates a stronger us vs. them mentality that 's a false argument . 
  moscow has been strongly promoting this ideology since putin came to power in 1999 . 
  it 's a core pillar of his ongoing administration . 
   and forces moscows hand to act potentially escalating the conflict further that 's also a false argument . 
  moscow has been escalating conflicts since it 's support of militaristis in abhkazia instigated the georgian conflict and rubber-stamped that policy with the invasion of ukraine . 
  we are at fault for not realizing this belligerency sooner and taking a hard stance against it . 
  this is not about peace at all costs , this is about a peace worth * having . 
  *  why does europe want to raise the stakes , why does europe want to escalate the conflict further ? 
  because we stand for something . 
  we stand for the rule of law , for the protection of rights , for the defence of ourselves and our allies . 
  for the freedom of people to criticize those in power and within the bounds of the law take action against them . 
  this is about creating the kind of world we want to live in within our borders , which means taking a stand against beligerents when they sponsor disturbances and war right at our very border . 
   well crimea is a done deal and returning crimea is n't a prerequisite for sanctions being lifted . 
  not for us , and we 're the ones who implement the sanctions . 
   also how are we supposed to target the energy market ? 
  a market where a lot of countries in the eu are very much reliant on russia ? 
  where else do we get gas from ? 
  other sources ? 
  most nations started a massive diversification effort back when this all kicked-off in 2014 . 
  russia completely depends upon the eu energy market . 
  it 's not painless of course , but it 's something that is both absolutely doable and something that should have been implemented years ago to send a strong , unifed message to the kremlin . 
  sanctioning it would send a massive and un-spinnable message to the kremlin about how destabilizing actions on our borders wo n't be tolerated . 
  that was also the crisis where russia unilaterally changed the amount of payment due from ukraine in direct breach of the terms of the contract . 
  let 's keep our story straight here . 
  this is of no surprise to anyone outside of the brexit campaign , who insist that juncker is a phantasm and his statements just the sound of the pipes cooling . 
  when putin is making announcements that russia 's invasion of crimea is `` a done deal '' and makes no mention of removing his military from the donbas region , there is zero effort on his part to improve relations with ukraine . 
  i was n't joking when i posted it earlier in this thread : these sanctions should be expanded and escalated . 
  target the energy market and bring a humbled putin to the table 2 years after he needlessly thrust this whole disaster into everyone 's laps . 
  how about we escalate 'em ? 
  while i 'm hopeful that more people will vote remain than leave , the main thing i 'm worried about is that the leave crowd will be so much more energized to vote . 
  their prominent supporters have helped this cause somewhat by being so reprehensible ( trump , le pen , farage , boris and his endless stupid comments ) so hopefully the thought of a foul face behind the leave crowd will be enough to get people to the voting booth . 
  yeah i grew up around belfast and went to uni there , and while i like the city and am pleased to see investment in it , so say that the people there are among the happiest in europe is laughable . 
  they and we are the same , of course . 
  itt people tired of hearing how bad it will be if we leave , and brexit voters trying to push that weariness as their argument . 
  disagree with both of you . 
  i 've never understood the desperate hopes of the brexit crowd . 
  i really , really like the idea of naples being tijuana . 
  i seriously did n't know this distinction existed . 
  barca just sounds more natural in english . 
  it 's pretty mental how everything the new polish conservative government does seems to be completely awful . 
  a non-idiotic leadership would descalate . 
   plain and simple , it 's actually a cultural schema , birthed from sincere mistrust in higher forces to provide for you . 
  that 's both a positive and a negative . 
  there 's obviously nothing malevolent behind it , i.e russia 's problem with corruption is not because it 's secretly run by a clan of super-secret gangster vors , it 's because of overt cynicism and systemic failures of state organs . 
  on the other hand this means that this non-malevolent form of corruption is going to be a real son of a bitch to ever get rid of . 
  for some reason the idea that polish people get stewart lee 's humour totally makes sense to me . 
   sean lock legitimately the first time i 've ever seen sean lock mentioned in one of these . 
  he 's scottish but frankie boyle . 
  i 'm at the office otherwise i 'd link to one of his many , * many * nsfw bits . 
  that dude is deliciously dark . 
  is anyone else getting 400 errors trying to load this image ? 
  hopefully a sign of things turning around for them !, 
  if i were to guess i 'd say putin has an opportunity to show it literally every second of the day . 
  this certainly sounds like the plan of a ronnie or claude . 
  too socially awkward to vote . 
  next year expand the roster to japan and brazil . 
  i want to see some crazy , fabulous shit . 
  huzzah and hurrah . 
  for what it 's worth , i think you 're all a great bunch of lads . 
  yeah , even you . 
  it 's crazy that that is * literally * the russian apologists position these days : okay , we 've failed to prevent everyone from noticing our media outlets are entirely endless propaganda streams , but here 's a new one : * all * media outlets are exactly the same !, 
  appealing to the internet 's deep-ingrained cynicism !, 
  it 's a masterstroke . 
  and still complete horseshit . 
  it 's nice to see russia push forward with fresh new forms of trolling . 
  believe me , most of us in the uk are aware that the brexit camp are asking us to disregard advice from the bank of england , the british school of economics , the prime minister , the president of the united states and just about everybody who is n't a right-wing organization getting funds from the kremlin like marine le pen is , or a close friend of putin as donald trumps advisors are . 
  now imagine how frustrated we are that so many of our fellow britons still loudly advocate for this position . 
  ah there we are , bright and early with the spin . 
  can we just build a big wall or something ?
