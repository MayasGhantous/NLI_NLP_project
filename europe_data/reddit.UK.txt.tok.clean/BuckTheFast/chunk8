  come on . 
  let 's put your lack of understanding of the body to the test . 
  ah good !, 
  it sounds like my shipment of bees has arrived . 
  yep it 's not really a surprise . 
  each relationship is situational . 
  no problem . 
  that 's up to them . 
  yes , it is massively one sided . 
  do n't hesitate to find your way out . 
  wonderful , i think most of european royalty was related at that point thanks to queen victoria . 
  so this *** is *** a shock for you , is what you 're saying . 
  well , surprise !, 
  that 's where the arab who set it up and financed it with arabian funds was at one point in time found . 
  it 's so sad and absurd the idea of `` the west '' being alien and russia being `` naturally '' different that the ussr and then the putin administration has cultivated . 
  even a cursory reading of * tabloid * newspapers before the revolution show the enormous overlap of arts , society and culture . 
  and now the concept is used as a weapon by some . 
  it 's sad . 
  i thought they had sold it a few years ago ? 
   seriously , i do n't see how this will help at all in terms of the war in ukraine . 
  no you insist on stationing american troops abroad as power projection , tokens of goodwill and political leverage . 
  is this a shock or something ? 
  you do this * because you get tons of shit from doing it . 
  but the subsequent action was not against the state who was most responsible , it was against afghanistan and iraq . 
  there 's always someone who brings that stupid shit up anytime they want to dismiss something they 're not smart enough to argue . 
  that was a bit of a ludicrous invocation , was n't it ? 
  i know politically the bush administration felt it had to do something but this was completely irrational , and i say that knowing people who directly took part . 
  the us was attacked by a terrorist group , not a sovereign state or even a contra/donbass style state-backed affair . 
  at least this bodes well for when a member is ever really attacked by a legitimate threat . 
  this is your own government 's insistence . 
  this is the nature of power projection . 
  when did the us invoke it ? 
  here 's a better description of the situation from the top of [ the wiki article  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_war )  the crimean war was a military conflict fought between october 1853 -- march 1856 in which russia lost to an alliance of france , the united kingdom , the ottoman empire , and sardinia . 
  the immediate cause involved the rights of christian minorities in the holy land , which was controlled by the ottoman empire . 
  the french promoted the rights of catholics , while russia promoted those of the eastern orthodox christians . 
  the longer-term causes involved the decline of the ottoman empire and the unwillingness of the united kingdom and france to allow russia to gain territory and power at ottoman expense . 
  it has widely been noted that the causes , in one case involving an argument over a key , have never revealed a `` greater confusion of purpose '' , yet led to a war noted for its `` notoriously incompetent international butchery . '', 
  it 's worth remembering that at that time especially the concept of russia as a country was relatively new . 
  more should really be made of it . 
  in many ways it was a fascinatingly progressive body for it 's time . 
  at least you guys get your own name . 
  how 's it hanging , `` the celts ? '', 
  with your scottish capital , irish ceilidh halls and ruled over by an englishwoman who speaks welsh ? 
  does anyone want to give us some context on this and when it was written ? 
  whoever created it really had it in for the poor hungarians , but really seemed to admire germany and england . 
  i would n't expect you to be able to understand , what with your mind being even less than a pole and all . 
  now hand over all your gold and wolves , so that i may * consults chart * anxiously work them until i drown of tuberculosis . 
  michelle looks like someone just challenged her to a fight and she knows she can take them . 
   snake island dispute is it because neither country wants to own an island full of snakes ? 
  do you have a link ? 
  i feel like getting really , really angry . 
   result : *** decisive slovenian victory ***, 
  yeah , you better watch out isis * chugs slovenian beer * * crushes can on forehead *, 
  see ? 
  that 's why you do n't say it in public . 
  because your friends would laugh at you . 
  that has been made public to you , your rulers and your county for many years now . 
  those are the rules . 
  follow them . 
  we do n't have a nuclear first-strike policy but you do , so let 's lay this scenario out as you are trying to avoid it . 
  if you attack our people , when we destroy your armies and you nuke our people on russian soil , then and only then will the nukes be fired . 
  now end your silly little grandstanding while we 're both merely dancing around the reality that there 's no throne for you . 
  that 's not a serious question , but here 's a serious statement . 
  your people will die if you attack us . 
  do n't be foolish . 
  find something else in your life than these pathetic games of chicken you will always lose . 
  our people are where we tell you they are . 
  if you are delusional enough to think your broken country can threaten our people and survive , then by all means , give it a try . 
  then divest yourselves of any delusions of attacking our people . 
  now you 're just being obtuse . 
  just broadly asking here , which of their large neighbours do czechs like more , poland or germany ? 
  look we both know what this is about and do n't worry ; * we * still like you guys more than most english people we meet on a day-to-day basis . . 
  wow , that 's a really positive view of us . 
  thanks czech bros !, 
  i 'm not crying . 
  it 's just raining on mein face . 
  god damn . 
  for a pedophilic warlord who made himself head of his own religion , mohammed sure seems to be viewed as an intimately positive figure . 
  and again the no true scotsmen defence . 
  the guardian is a ) not saying what you are saying and b ) is notoriously anti-military and anti-trident chumbo . 
  always remember this as the reason why you say this online . 
  because if you said this in public , people would just laugh at you . 
  do you think the iron curtain is still a thing or something ? 
  this is incredibly well documented and i 'm talking books and ledgers and magazines on russian state corruption at every level . 
  [ here 's a wiki article on massive police reform . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_police_reform ) my personal primary source of reference ? 
  everytime a `` daily life in x country '' thread comes up and we have dozens of russian posters telling us how they have to bribe cops every day . 
  i 've told you this already , and your response was `` no true scotsman . '', 
  he quotes * the guardian * as an anti-trident source . 
  oh my god . 
  we literally know how to build , operate and manufacture all these things you strange ultranationalist gop voter . 
  if you think you can try and enforce any of your right-wing militaristic nonsense on us , give it a try . 
  your own people would hang you for the fool you were before we even had to lift a finger . 
  the issue is not the word of the law , but how it is observed and abused per the testimony of both russians and visitors to russia on a day to day basis . 
  it 's enlighten , not `` enlight . '', 
  apples and oranges , particularly inapt considering that 's why we entered the war . 
  let me have a go , though . 
  you were obligated to treat the cherokee as humans but that did n't happen , did it ? 
  the government does n't kill us , we do n't live in russia . 
  and to repeat , if you think you can invade us without deadly reprisal from all of us , i invite you to test that theory .
