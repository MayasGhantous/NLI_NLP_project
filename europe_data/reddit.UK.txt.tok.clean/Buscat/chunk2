  troubling times for europe . 
  fully agreed . 
  i 'm just trying to get the discussion to the point where people realize we need to take action on the incentives we 're giving these people . 
  jeans ? 
  naw they mostly squat in track pants . 
  not to mention there 's no definition of `` social exclusion '' . 
  poverty can be measured , but `` at risk of '' a situation that is vague to begin with ? 
  seems like it just exists to reinforce a political opinion ( `` everyone should be a welfare state '' ) with `` data '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragedy_of_the_commons https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_rider_problem i get what you 're saying , but people will not behave as you want them to . 
  we 're talking about what people will do , not what they should do . 
  `` people will work within their abilities to improve their own situation as much as possible '' seems to be heresy in 2015 . 
  we could have avoided this with common sense but we wanted the world to fit our fantasy of utopia . 
  a stitch in time saves nine . 
  eastern europe is preserving themselves at the cost of being unfashionable in the eyes of western europeans , who find it easy to demonize them . 
  but increasingly , we will envy them and curse our naivety . 
  act like kings , be surprised when people are n't lining up to get under your boot ... hmmm . 
  we survived the cold war without fighting in europe . 
  i do n't think we 'll slide into the war if we undo a federalist system a few decades old . 
  afghanistan was us trying to impose democracy in a part of the world where that means nothing . 
  no wonder we got bogged down . 
  russia 's goal in syria is the status quo antebellum . 
  far less outrageous . 
  we said we were sovereign nations . 
  they called our bluff . 
  oh boy , buzzfeed is covering this now . 
  now kids on social media can enlighten me about what 's `` really '' going on . 
  nahlah ayed ca n't be trusted . 
  she has an agenda of portraying this whole thing as big-eyed children crying for the cameras . 
  the day that little boy turned up on the beach , her bloc at the cbc was trying to throw him at the government 's feet here , because he `` could have been canadian '' . 
  because all suffering anywhere is apparently our fault for failing to prevent it . 
  they claimed his father applied for asylum here , which turned out to be a lie , but they never apologized . 
  the whole thing became a `` scandal '' to the government , in a `` it 's a scandal because we say it is on twitter '' sort of way . 
  absolutely disgusting to use taxpayer money to shove propaganda down our throats . 
  none of that shit stopped it from shoving migrants down all our throats , did it ? 
  it 's not a nation when that would entail any accountability . 
  but when it has some fucking agenda to force on it , it 's a nation and we are but a minor province . 
   from each according to his ability , to each according to his need . 
  always makes alarm bells go off in my head . 
  `` hurr durr we can just change the system to be ` everyone act perfectly ' . 
  why has nobody ever though of that ? '', 
  idiots . 
  we said we were sovereign countries . 
  they called our bluff . 
  we 'll be enslaved by professional victims if we do n't buck up and accept it 's better to look like the bad guy sometimes than to roll over and die . . 
  top gear !, 
  there 's probably tens of thousands of young men in those migrant hordes who were fighting as jihadis and got bored/scared and decided to come play victim in europe . 
  it has a border with north korea that is only around 15km long !, 
  there is a fixed `` human nature '' which determines the dominant economic form ( instead of the other way about ) . 
  i would n't say fixed , but yes , we come pre-programmed with the desire to gain status , wealth , ensure the best for our children , etc. 
  no amount of brainwashing has ever been able to remove this . 
  socialism or communism always leads to dictatorship ( do n't see why this should be so ) . 
  it will always be so because communism can only fall back on force where ideology fails . 
  there is no safety valve of democracy to address the needs of the people , because time and time again , the first thing people in communist societies vote for when they 're able to is `` no more communism , please ! '' . 
  it also lacks the economic incentive to make people work , assuming ( or pretending to assume ) they will do so out of some kind of spirit of worker solidarity . 
  this has also never been the case , and once again , the only answer is force . 
  people wo n't work without large cash incentives ( clearly not necessarily true ) . 
  it need n't be cash , but they need an incentive . 
  obviously people have worked together since long before coinage was conceived . 
  but without being able to keep the fruits of their labour or any equivalent property , and without the threat of force or social ostracism , no , i do not believe people will work . 
  socialism or communism involves not wanting to advance oneself ( part of the strawman ) . 
  how can you say it does n't ? 
  along what path are you allowed to advance in ideal communism ? 
  at least in actual communism you could say `` well , if i pay the right bribes and curry the right favours . . '' ... but in ideal communism ? 
  the highest aspiration you 're permitted is to give your all in servitude . 
  the thing that boggles my mind about communism is how much overlap it has with religion . 
  essential to communism was the idea of a worldwide struggle against the enemy , and only once the enemy had been wiped off the earth could people live in utopia . 
  that 's what scares me about utopian ideology . 
  the `` greater good '' is always infinitely good , and therefore anything is justified for it . 
  this is why i 'll always be a cynical capitalist who thinks the best we can do is redirect people 's urges in a constructive manner and try to avoid the traps and destructive incentives of human interaction . 
  i do n't think we 're any different from our ancestors , i do n't even think society shapes us to be much different . 
  all it is , is the current framework we exist in . 
  you can see how little our system has molded us when it breaks down . 
  the economic system determines the nature of man ? 
  please . 
  order collapses and we 're back to `` might makes right '' in a fortnight . 
  adam smith argued for an end to mercantile economics , which was a zero-sum economic model , and proved that via trade and cooperation , nations can thrive together without it being at the expense of each other . 
  this has been a major force for peace since , and indeed , the first world war represents a time when we tried to revert to mercantilism by just trading within our empires and trying to economically isolate the competition . 
  if we 'd just stuck to adam smith , none of it would have happened . 
  the problem with `` criticizing capitalism '' is that you 're usually just `` criticizing human nature '' . 
  marx 's thinking was naive . 
  he basically just said `` ok replace the current bad guys with currently oppressed people , and the inherent evil of the bad guys will disappear and the good of the workers will endure '' . 
  what he failed to see was that the elements of human nature that make people suffer unnecessarily under capitalism will still exist under any system . 
  all it does is drive something very natural underground , and create an inherently corrupt playing field for it . 
  combine that with the fact that without any monetary incentive to work , you only had the application of force to incentivize production , and it 's hardly surprising that communism leads time and time again to brutal dictatorial regimes , an upper class as corrupt as ever , mass poverty , and death . 
  this is why one of the central pillars of communist thought is the denial of human nature , and the idea that people can be reshaped as needed by society . 
  this is also why they had a huge problem with genetics and evolution , because they saw it as threatening to the idea that they could just propagandize people out of behaving in their self-interest . 
  i think 100 years of attempted communism is ample proof that human nature is too deeply inherent to our brains to just `` teach '' away , and that the desire to compete and advance one 's own status will always find an outlet , until we develop the technology totally rewire our brains . 
  not sure i want to live in that world either though . 
  you characterize china 's growth as unstable , but compare the gdp in recent decades of [ china ] ( https://www.google.ca/search?q=china+gdp&amp;oq=china+gdp&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2302j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=utf-8 ) and [ japan ] ( https://www.google.ca/search?es_sm=93&amp;q=japan+gdp+per+capita&amp;stick=h4siaaaaaaaaaopguelqz9u3mi43tteyy0620s_jt04syczp0y8uadlfjznjitnxranpqcgr9jsc-lz83mw8ofbbalf8cmjbzkkiapigxbbeaaaa&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ckabelcfmbzqfqotcjcyhp-a48gcfqsyiaodep0f-w&amp;biw=1455&amp;bih=726#q=japan+gdp ) . 
  in addition , japan 's demographic trends are very troubling . 
  their population is aging and shrinking . 
  unless they can reverse this , the future definitely does n't lie with them , no matter what their gdp per capita . 
  interactive ? 
  i 'm going to be requiring additional minerals with all the walls i 'll build . 
  many of them still ca n't even admit communism was a bad idea . 
  you really think their worldview will allow them to admit fault ? 
  the answer will be the same as ever . 
  `` heartless conservatives did n't sacrifice enough for these people , so of course we have them bombing nightclubs . 
  social conditions caused this , bla bla bla they can never be responsible for their own actions it 's always us . '', 
  the left will be forced to admit they ca n't just take the easy moral highground regardless of consequences while portraying everyone as racists ?
