about 75 % of things they write are bullshit designed to incite fear and outrage from the british middle class , usually directed at immigrants , muslims , lgbt people , the left wing , the eu , etc. 
  whilst deflecting it away from the conservatives . 
  occasionally they post something of quality , but it 's normally a diamond in the rough . 
  i personally prefer the independent , since the times is behind a paywall and the telegraph & amp ; guardian have both gone a bit downhill . 
  the sun , express and mirror were n't great to begin with . 
  with the main choices of conservative leader being her , osbourne and boris , and it looking more and more like corbyn will be labour leader : may god help us all . 
  on the other hand , at least there will be a very strongly defined `` left '' and `` right '' , meaning the liberal democrats will become relevant again as the centrists . 
  built like a brick . 
  i still have it in my closet somewhere in case my iphone decides to opt out of existence . 
  brilliant ; not only will they keep coming , their governments will * help * them in doing so . 
  who came up with this idea ? 
  whilst it would be , the problem is the media will start drawing comparisons to how european countries acted in the 19th century . 
  there 's really no winning it seems : - /, 
  you 're not very good at putting it in a `` friendly , tongue-in-cheek '' way , if you are saying that you do not actually believe british people to be inferior to you . 
   it 's the british . 
  nothing they do would surprise me at this point . 
  island monkeys . 
  maybe my `` monkey '' brain is too stupid to read that as a clear sign of what you think of my country . 
  i am going to assume that you are german , or at least a native german speaker . 
  i never did understand the origin of that insult ; do you think that british people are ugly , stupid , violent , not correctly evolved , or all of the above ? 
  your open dislike fascinates my `` primitive '' british mind .

  do a google search . 
  there are plenty of reasons . 
  judging by your previous comments , you have a real chip on your shoulder about this country . 
  it has much more than that do n't worry , ( or do , as the case may be , it seems you want this country out of the eu asap ) . 
  did i ever say i was a federalist ? 
  please tell me where i did . 
  i also think that the needs of all of the population should be considered . 
  our government however has a minimal majority at most and so is pandering more and more towards those who left the conservative party for ukip , and pretty much ignoring the rest of us . 
  just someone who has invested considerable amounts of time and money into an eu-based career . 
  see if the folks at / r/ukipparty can get farage over here . 
  apparently he 's computer-illiterate so it might be hard to get him here without someone to type his replies for him . 
  it had more pictures avaliable than [ science museum had on their own exhibition of photos from the time . 
  ] ( http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/exhibitions/make_life_worth_living ) it was the first article on the exhibition that came up under a google search for more pictures .

  since when has your flair been vietnamese ? 
  i 'm moving a little further south than the * ostsee * . 
  i 'll drive , thanks . 
  yep sounds about right . 
  the sort who live in benidorm , with their `` no spanish food '' restaurants , drinking carling and reading the daily mail , complaining constantly that immigrants who do n't bother to assimilate destroy the local culture . 
  some of them even go so far as to vote ukip . 
  it 's incomprehensible to me . 
  `` too many foreigners destroying the uk . 
  it 's why i moved to spain . '', 
  i wish that were satire , i really do . 
  you 'd be surprised how many brits in the uk would happily shit on their compatriots in the rest of the eu if it would stop freedom of movement . 
  it 's really quite annoying as someone who is hoping to take up a job in germany , that my future may be decided by people on the south coast with rose-tinted glasses for [ the 1960s ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2776842/shocking-photos-capture-real-squalor-britain-s-slums-poverty-meant-afford-playstation.html ) . 
  well of course we were ignored . 
  tony blair would have done anything bush told him to . 
  he ties with thatcher for the worst pm for a reason . 
  i 'm down in the south west of england for a friend 's wedding today . 
  i 'll see my old friends and then we will also drink ourselves half to oblivion . 
  i 'm bringing several crates of stuttgarter hofbr\u00e4u hefeweizen ; a gift for aiding along the after-party . 
  this could get messy . 
  yeah good luck with that . 
  it 's been well hidden for 70 years ; with the current situation i 'm pretty sure they 'd rather leave it buried than give it to russia . 
  [ not enough for the telegraph to delete their own article about how the uk has already opted out of any quotas ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11700336/eu-summit-david-cameron-uses-eu-opt-out-to-refuse-migrant-quotas.html ) . 
  sounds like a great way for the telegraph to try get the uk out of the eu , considering that this wo n't happen as the uk [ already has an opt-out ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11700336/eu-summit-david-cameron-uses-eu-opt-out-to-refuse-migrant-quotas.html ) ( link ironically enough , from the telegraph ), 
  one of my best friends is french . 
  he showed me it when we were in his hometown and were about 16/17 years old . 
  i loved it . 
  one of my favourite scenes has to be the [ concours d'arrestation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or_wcv83eya ) , the `` pool party '' and the supermarket . 
  sadly the other 2 do n't seem to be on youtube . 
  [ as britain has an opt-out ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11700336/eu-summit-david-cameron-uses-eu-opt-out-to-refuse-migrant-quotas.html ) , and david cameron is worried about his more right-wing voters flocking to nigel farage , i would n't worry about that . 
  seen . 
  if people move into an area , the area will need schools , doctors , blue light services , carpenters , road cleaners , farmers , etc. 
  most jobs only exist because people live in the area . 
  if they 're genuinely refugees and not economic migrants , i 'm sure they 'd be grateful for the chance to start afresh , even if it is in what was an abandoned village . 
  that 's the scottish lakes , or `` lochs '' . 
  yes but lets put them on the mediterranean coast . 
  welsh beaches are a little too cold for naturism . 
  i 've heard it used to be a thing in the welsh lakes though . 
  i believe there 's a naturist beach in brighton , though . 
  i 'm surprised . 
  with our government 's usual attitude toward alcohol ( see : taxation levels that only ireland and scandinavia are even comparable ) i thought ours would be one of the lowest , instead of the highest . 
  some days , i just like to watch things that are absurd and a bit on the stupid side ( normally when hungover ) . 
  iron sky , borat , the dictator , god bless america , and the first 3 scary movie films ( none of the others with movie in the title though , even i have limits ) generally fill that void . 
  yes you 're right there was some italian in it !, 
  i forgot about that . 
  the gulag system was not deliberate ? 
  stalinism killed about three times more people than nazism . 
  at least germany feels regret for its actions in the 20th century . 
  russia just bans discussing its actions instead . 
  french : la haine , l\u00e9on , nikita , les 11 commandements ( french jackass ) , la premi\u00e8re jour du reste de ta vie , am\u00e9lie , dikkenik german : das boot , der untergang , das experiment , iron sky ( english and german ) norwegian : dead snow swedish : the girl with the dragon tattoo honorary mention : inglorious basterds , as it was in english , french and german, 
  interesting that it 's the daily mail providing such an article . 
  i remember when farage shouted that it 's `` all liberal media progressives trying to silence [ him ] '' and i heard lots of people , particularly students , asking how it can be trying to silence him when it has him in for interviews and whatever at every opportunity . 
  not taking a side , just giving an example . 
  i have some friends in the saarland ; when we were going to take a road trip , we went into luxembourg to fill up before heading east . 
  i think every car in that gas station was on german plates . 
  we already have a surplus of rain and cloud . 
  i ca n't remember the last time i saw the sun . 
  actually i think i was in france ... 
  in britain it 's the other way around . 
  rain since july with maybe 3 days of not-completely-grey skies . 
  oh come now , aside from sussex last week there has n't been much flooding this summer . 
  the clouds are even a lighter shade of grey than usual . 
  cannstatter volksfest in stuttgart is nicer in my opinion . 
  less tourists and stag parties who ca n't handle their beer .
