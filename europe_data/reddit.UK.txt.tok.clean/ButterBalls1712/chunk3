  driving at about 200 when some dutchman pulled out in front of me doing about 120 . 
  glad the car is n't mine . 
  it probably lost a few years worth of life on the brake pads . 
  you have about 10 seconds ... 
  you 'd fit in well where i come from . 
  * joins in passive aggressively staring down the person who tried to talk to me on the bus this morning *, 
  the united states of america . 
  :( it also happens with cities . 
  i am not from london or manchester . 
  no not all cities are similar in this country . 
  buckfast make porridge ? 
  my dad 's side of the family are irish , but when i think of ireland i think of : green countryside irish music [ the cliffs of moher ] ( http://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cliffssunset.jpg ) catholicism st. patrick the beautiful accents guinness , bailey 's & jameson the fact that the local garda was waiting for me at the station , because my train was late and my aunt had called worried sick that i had missed it . 
  if george galloway were to somehow become labour leader , or anything with a semblance of power , you 're welcome to carpool to folkstone with me . 
  i 'm fast when i 'm not reading an article . 
  of course !, 
  i forgot res can block a specific word . 
  wonder if / r/unitedkingdom will become `` it seems there is nothing here '' without `` corbyn '' xd a friend of mine sent me an image of a `` lefty tears '' pint glass during the election , but sadly i think it was shopped . 
  would have made for a fine glass to go out for a pint in brighton . 
  in their minds , germany had a much better policy on immigration and how to handle religious minorities back then than the uk does now . 
  you only have to read the comments section of my local newspaper or the daily mail to see that . 
  wrong person , dude . 
  i 've never seen anything about flags or food . 
  we did have a thing about the best and most shit towns in the country recently but i think that 's the best it has gotten . 
  i wish the mods would add a tag to anything with the word `` corbyn '' in the title so that i could filter it out . 
  `` he 's not the messiah , he 's a very naughty boy ! '', 
  comes to mind . 
  please send it our way . 
  i 'm running low and it 's a sunday evening . 
  it was mine but it 's turning into tory-fuelled doom-and-gloom and the worship of jeremy corbyn . 
  i wish the politics would disappear to / r/ukpolitics but i suspect it 's still under / pol / occupation . 
  rest in peace . 
  no father should have to bury his son :(, 
  i think i 'm more around the french level than the british . 
  to listen to the more nationalistic british , it 's almost like they wish it still was wwii . 
  standing completely alone against the vast majority of what is now the european union , a mighty empire still intact . 
  it seems a lot of these people think that the uk should have never gotten involved in alliances with what they * still * see as `` the enemy '' . 
  ah , i thought this was the meps in the ep . 
  i imagine the uk would be about half purple on that . 
  i was just thinking `` we 're not as anti-eu as i thought . 
  who runs the efdd , anyway ? 
  of course . 
  ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/photo-diary/files/2014/05/blog_farage.jpg ) :-( '', 
  pissing off the elite is a good way to get to putin though . 
  also these are people who voluntarily accepted russian passports with `` crimea , russia '' listed as a birthplace . 
  they can still enter on a ukrainian one . 
  i absolutely agree about doing nothing being the best idea . 
  the meat and beer are in the fridge , my laptop is hooked up to the tv with netflix , my friend is coming here later and we are going to make the best of it . 
  hope your sunday is a peaceful one !, 
  ah , the * only * country with an anti-eu majority . 
  :-( on a positive note , less of the efdd than i would have expected for the uk . 
  edit : it seems i was mistaken ; should n't the uk have a * lot * of purple ? 
  the [ efdd is chaired by nigel farage after all ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_of_freedom_and_direct_democracy ) . 
  it seems whatever the bbc does , if it does n't match someone 's worldview , they will accuse it of `` bias '' . 
  take my uncle for example , he believes the bbc is a hippy eu-funded anti-british outpost and that we should all read something factual that tells the truth about the eu , like the daily mail or express . 
  unlikely , but if this is the standard passport being issued now , and other eu countries start taking the same stance , his citizens are going to get mightily pissed off when they ca n't go to italy for their holidays , paris for shopping , or even get home to london . 
  that 's a brilliant idea actually . 
  i 've just been covering my face with a damp rag , tidying the house and watching whatever rubbish prosieben can throw at me all day . 
  going to the supermarket was enough exertion in this humidity but a sunday without meat , cheese , bread and some beer was not something i could handle right now . 
  you too ? 
  the humidity is just ... eurgh . 
  my weather app says it 's 33 outside but it feels like 40 . 
  how is it still so warm outside ? 
  i 've pulled the shutters down and am waiting it out . 
  i was supposed to meet a friend today but it did n't happen . 
  regio bahn + this heat = please kill me . 
  going by the godawful old stereotypes ... 
  i 'm english , so i should say sorry for upsetting you , but you 're german ... this can only end one way : to belgium ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ few ^ ^ ^ ^ beers !, 
  it was a swabian who sent me that `` how german sounds compared to other languages '' video , interestingly enough . 
  nothing wrong with making fun of an incorrect stereotype . 
  the famous german sense of humour right there . 
  i 'm quite aware . 
  i do n't think i could stand staying most of the summer here if it actually was like that . 
  i 'm from southern england originally , so i 'm practically foreign to you guys ;-) i 'll record one in each language i know when i get home . 
  i 'm in germany so i guess i could do either german or english ...  `` gr\u00dc\u00df gott !, 
  only in german could that sound so terrifying . 
  we just tut and watch disapprovingly , unless you come across a drunken `` u wot m8 '' type . 
  from a southern perspective ; i 'll add to them as i remember them : glasgow - where we send buckfast tonic wine edinburgh - posh , could be english london - people who do n't know the world out of their city exists ; contains 4 subdivisions : - east london - friendly tricksters and the mob - west london - russians , chinese , arabs , and the old aristocracy - north london - hipsters and snobs who wo n't go south of the river - south london - hipsters and snobs who wont go north of the river liverpool - criminals . 
  manchester - friendlier criminals birmingham - depressing accents brighton - gays the rest of sussex - pensioners surrey - posh twats / people who kept moving further out of london to find a house they could afford kent - ukip and ale oxfordshire - posh twats ; david cameron and jeremy clarkson cambridge - posh twats essex - idiots cornwall - holiday homes and incest norfolk - holiday homes and incest devon - farmers and katie hopkins somerset - cider & glastonbury newcastle - unintelligible , good ale though dorset - extreme elderly wales - sheep shagging and rationing on vowels in place names yorkshire - penny pinchers lancashire - flat caps and whippets milton keynes - the ultimate in boring , suburban futility, 
  my mum was asking me `` whats that ? '', 
  a lot as she is n't a french speaker . 
  it can yes be annoying , but she wanted to be certain of what i was ordering for her as she suffers from heartburn very badly ( and so likes to know the full list of things in any meal she is buying ) . 
  she 's starting to learn a lot of the words but there will sometimes be some that throw her off . 
  she 's also partially deaf so is maybe too loud for this woman , and no , my mum is n't the slimmest person in the world but hardly what a normal person would consider `` fat '' . 
  plenty of other side right there . 
  born in the uk , went to a lyc\u00e9e for the final years of secondary school , followed by a universit\u00e4t afterwards . 
  about half of the classes in the universit\u00e4t were in english though . 
  the german guy was a friend i had met in those classes . 
  two experiences come to mind . 
  one was when i was in a restaurant in france with my mother . 
  she had never been to the area before , and asked me in english what i thought she would enjoy . 
  a woman on the next table called us `` typical loud , fat , culture-less , disgusting english '' to what i assume was her sister , so i turned and asked them in perfect french `` pardon me . 
  we 're not from around here , as you may have noticed . 
  i was wondering what you would recommend to eat ? '', 
  they immediately got up and asked for the bill . 
  the other time i was in germany ; i was driving and my friend was on the phone . 
  he was telling his girlfriend what the doctor had told him about the injury he had sustained recently , and how that would affect their sex life in graphic detail . 
  i just said in german `` i 'm going to pretend i 'm not here '' , he jumped and said `` oh , shit , sorry , forgot you speak german . '', 
  and wrapped up the call . 
  ** tl ; dr ** rude bitches and broken penises . 
  i ended up in belgium with a very good friend of mine , who comes from stuttgart .
