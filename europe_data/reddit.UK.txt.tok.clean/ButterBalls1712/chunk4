  we asked for two beers and they gave us two 25cl glasses . 
  they looked confused when we said `` no , that 's one beer in two glasses . '', 
  these glasses were not made for british or german beer lovers . 
  when at university , i once brought a few crates of weizen for a bbq . 
  it was midsummer and it seemed an appropriate way of introducing some folks from the us to germany ( they had just arrived that day ) . 
  later that afternoon the bbq is going well , and someone asks me to open them a beer since they ca n't find a bottle opener ( oh you misguided soul ) , so i go find a my lighter and pop the cap off for them . 
  they seem nice , so i start talking . 
  i start by asking where their beer glass is , so i can pour their beer for them . 
  `` nope , do n't have one '' `` oh , umm i 'll go get one from the house if you want to come too ? '', 
  `` nah , it 's good '' * starts drinking from the bottle * `` are you ... are you sure ? 
  we probably have one around here or '' `` it 's good '' `` oh , normally we drink it from a glass , we think it tastes better '' `` nah . '', 
  * drinks the entire bottle * `` this stuff is pretty good . 
  strong too . 
  better than bud or miller . 
  you got more ? '', 
  `` umm ... 
  i do n't think so we did n't get much . '', 
  i brought 5,0 export from then on . 
  but they 've been around long enough now to just call themselves `` american '' . 
  germany has n't been around that long , but people will refer to themselves as german ( unless you 're in the country but you get that here and we 've been a country for over 1000 years ), 
  likewise , if you were not born in this country or do n't live in this country , you ca n't go around telling people you 're from it . 
  by the logic you see americans using , i could go around telling people i 'm russian . 
  i 've not been there ( yet ) but one of my ancestors was born there so that makes me as russian as anyone in moscow . 
  because they would be better known as uneducated afro-eurasians . 
  too many nationalities in there to place the blame solely on the uk . 
  you have a point darling . 
  we like his policies on being rich and building a wall to keep immigrants out , but we 're not so sure about his lack of offering another war with germany ; al murray has got him on that one . 
  i know , it 's just we prefer to be known as joyless people , alcoholics , racists or people who are living in a fossilised empire . 
  they must really hate us there ; the norwegians , finnish , swiss and austrians got all the insults we prefer to be known by . 
  i used to live in south germany whilst at university , and lived with people from lots of different places . 
  the guy from bern had the nerve to say the guy from near regensburg sounded like a hillbilly . 
  he had clearly never heard himself speak . 
  in response to the article title ; probably because she 's a beautiful ship who does her job really well , even if she was laid down in nazi germany . 
  that 's really cool . 
  we still have the [ * victory * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_victory ) commissioned as the flagship of the first sea lord , but she 's been in a dry dock since the 1920s . 
  we just need to move a few more countries and we 'll be able to build a bridge to america . 
  actually , bad idea . 
  florida man could turn up in cornwall then . 
  i ca n't blame them for giving the discounts . 
  it would n't look good if the employee parking lot for daimler was full of bmws or vws . 
  interestingly enough , i saw the bmw i8 prototype being tested in sindelfingen . 
  you have to love the friendly rivalry between them . 
  from my window i can see : japanese ( honda , toyota ) german ( vw , bmw , mercedes ) `` american '' ( ford ) actually american ( my neighbour has a dodge charger for some reason ) german/american/british ( vauxhall ) french ( renult ) czech ( skoda ) british/german ( mini ) swedish ( volvo ) british/indian ( jaguar ) i 'd say in britain we 've actually managed to have cars from all over the world . 
  [ the pope uses a ford focus or drives himself around the vatican in a 1984 renault 4 . 
  the popemobile is the mercedes m-class that benedict xvi used . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/popemobile#current_usage ), 
  i think it depends on where in germany you are . 
  i went to visit a friend in esslingen , and you can certainly see that daimler give employee discounts . 
  it was more unusual to see a car that * was n't * a mercedes benz . 
  this is true . 
  the naked french guy trying to keep what was left of his dignity with a baseball cap whilst asking at the lost & found if anyone had seen his shorts seemed to be doing a lot of drunken mumbling . 
  when i had a problem in hamburg , the doctor asked if i lived in germany ; i said no so he just asked which language i wanted the ehic form in , and then got to work . 
  seemed to be covered under the aok insurance , so i did n't have to pay anything . 
  was in and out in half an hour , most of which was spent waiting for the receptionist to validate everything . 
  spain can also sell goods to them if it so wishes by hiring trucks on french plates to move goods into the country , then . 
  hear that , farmers ? 
  better start burning everything in french-registered trucks just to be sure !, 
  the french ca n't talk !, 
  i 've seen you guys in barcelona . 
  the germans , dutch , austrians , swedish , italians , russians and polish ca n't talk either for matter . 
  you may have done it a little too well and sounded like a daily mail columnist . 
  [ the idea of a european union has existed for a long time , but what is now the eu was born out of a postwar europe .

  the last few months ca n't have been easy on her . 
  hopefully its nothing serious and she makes a full recovery . 
  typical german ; boring and serious whilst on the job , a good laugh as soon as she gets home . 
  good , some people need roadside eye tests . 
  some of the driving you see in rural devon is fucking terrifying . 
  you 'd think the existence of `` lgbtory '' and `` lgbt * in ukip '' would make it obvious that lgbt people are able to hold right wing views . 
  apparently not . 
  do you really think that would ever happen ? 
  i do n't see it with the current hatred of immigration and the way immigration is used as a scapegoat whenever anything goes wrong . 
  yup , i 'm french / german educated . 
  i now speak three languages , have an education and do n't have the sort of debts the uk thinks anyone trying to better themselves should be lumped with . 
  i know , how * dare * the eu stop our proud * british * tradition of workhouses !, 
  evil * foreigners * telling us what to do on our own sacred isle . 
  the eu is the only thing standing in the way of g4s and serco being able to set up `` employment camps '' where the poor , disabled and other undesirables can * aspire * to bringing back victorian levels of industry . 
  the uk could rather do with some of this investment in infrastructure . 
  have you ever tried going west of exeter ? 
  born in the uk , educated in france , worked for a while in germany . 
  never had to deal with any visas or documentations outside of what a normal local has to , do n't even need a passport to fly from germany to italy for a holiday , and do n't even have to change my money before going . 
  then there 's the fact that my employer can not make me work stupidly long hours , i get several weeks of paid holiday each year , i can use the healthcare systems in any eu state without worrying about insurance , and everything i buy is held to a high standard . 
  i ca n't help but feel that the majority of people from the uk have * no idea * the vast majority of these benefits exists , as either the uk government opts out of them , or they would never experience going across a border without stopping in their daily lives . 
  that 's the choice of the british government though . 
  they 're not exactly the most pro-immigration government around here ... 
  yet if he had said `` leave '' i suspect the kippers would be calling him the `` voice of reason and common sense who everyone needs to listen to '' . 
  he was asked his opinion by the bbc , he gave it . 
  ukip 's social media team is relentless . 
  have you ever seen the bbc facebook page 's comments ? 
  even in individual countries it 's hard to bring it down to a single stereotype . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02371/vicky_2371818b.jpg ) and [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a8/d0/e9/a8d0e9b7f8bb68d684cf57c0180a8edf.jpg ) are both stereotypes of the english , depending on where in england you are . 
  nobody comes to mind in particular for me , but i would like to hear who comes to american minds when you say `` european '' , if anyone . 
  coco chanel ? 
  david guetta ? 
  there are thousands of positive and negative stereotypical images who could come to mind . 
  we 're a huge place and we ca n't even get individual countries down to a single culture , so i would be interested to see who comes up as the most prominent . 
  in south west england the supermarket cheese aisle often has 2 sections of about equal size ; `` cheddar '' and `` other '' . 
  the very mature cheddar is alright but i personally find the mild a bit tasteless . 
  [ there are plenty of other cheeses from britain though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_british_cheeses ) , my personal favourites of the british cheeses are blue stilton and wensleydale . 
  i 've been staying in my friend 's farmhouse in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg for a while .
