i 'm the predator here , and your nothing but my victim . 
  that has got to be one of the worst lines even written . 
  afaik they only blacklisted those who had deserted from the irish army to fight , not ordinary citizens who had joined . 
  it 's a mixed reaction . 
  on the one hand they 're seen as hard-working ( in contrast to those lazy natives ) , but on the other they 're `` stealing our jobs '' and not integrating into british society very well . 
  there are actually more muslims in the uk , france and germany ( and perhaps more countries - i ca n't remember ) than in the us . 
  not per capita either . 
   there is no real desire from those on the islands to `` leave '' scotland since the actual poll is behind a paywall and the link is vague , was it asking whether they wanted to remain part of a scotland within the uk or would they want to remain part of an independent scotland ? 
  he did both actually . 
   most powerful sovereigns : all of christendom should hold great celebrations , and especially god 's church , for the finding of such a multitude of such friendly peoples , which with very little effort will be converted to our holy faith , and so many lands filled with so many goods very necessary to us in which all christians will have comfort and profits , all of which was unknown nor did anyone speak of it except in fables . 
  --  your highnesses have an other world here , by which our holy faith can be so greatly advanced and from which such great wealth can be drawn . 
  the spanish crown sent ( and funded ) thousands and thousands of missionaries to the americas , they clearly cared about spreading their faith . 
  you 've never heard the phrase `` god , gold , and glory '' ? 
  what is that video supposed to show ? 
  i do n't know what they were saying but it did n't seem that aggressive and it was no louder then i would expect to hear on public transport . 
  well , then provide another source to back up your claims . 
  that 's interesting . 
  although certain sections of goan society may have supported portuguese rule i 'm still pretty skeptical that it had majority support . 
  creating a bureaucratic elite from the native population is a pretty standard tactic of colonial rule , and seeing as they benefited from maintaining the current status quo they would support portugal . 
  what did everyone else think ? 
  what / u/utwogunsalute said . 
  also , using nato forces to protect the colonies of a european power would n't have gone over very well with a lot of the world . 
   from what i understand , the majority of goans still wanted to be part of portugal and were forcefully absorbed into india . 
  i 've skimmed the wiki page you linked ( and a few others ) and none of them mention any popular support for portuguese rule . 
  where are you getting this from ? 
  and why would you say that ? 
  it sounds like your saying that being related to a gang member is a pretty good indication that you are in a gang yourself . 
  or maybe it was just poor wording . 
   the family claiming that he was not a member of a gang is a bit rich considering he was related to des nooanan . 
  he was the nephew of one of his ex-wives . 
  i would n't exactly call that `` related '' . 
  how long ago did you have the union jack ? 
  it seems to be that the entire sub has moved to a more euskeptic position , so that may be why your getting upvoted now . 
  in my admittedly personal experience it 's actually the eastern european immigrants that most people have a problem with here ( and by here i mean northern england - might be different in other places ) . 
  and the claims that are made about muslim ( or generally non-white ) immigrants by many members of this sub are made about e.e. 
  immigrants much more often ; do n't engage with the host culture , have their own shops , refuse to learn english , exploiting the benefit sytem , undermining wages . 
  the average person does n't really differentiate between muslim or eastern european immigration . 
  and i 'm really lost as to what this common european culture we all supposedly share actually consists of . 
   improving them as well as benefitting from them otherwise known as exploiting them . 
  come on , in pretty much every large thread on here there 'll be a couple of ww jokes and they are very rarely funny . 
  / u/youni89 is being downvoted for making a ww joke while having an american flag . 
  edit : and now it 's been submitted to / r/shitamericanssay i suspect it will be downvoted even more . 
   i 'd say they keep putting it on there to spread awareness more than anything else . 
  but why are they using this survey to spread awareness ? 
  i 've never seen it mentioned on this sub before , it just seems so out of place . 
  europe : netherlands non-europe : usa, 
  there is actually a bad history thread on this http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1tbi1z/reurope_discusses_ww1/ and an askhistorians one ( that 's kind of meh . 
  i did n't say it was easy , i implied that just seizing power did not make him an `` amazing leader '' . 
  what did he actually do once he had power that made him an amazing leader ? 
  what did he do that was so amazing ? 
  other than actually seizing power , of course . 
  iirc that was a protest organised by a far-left independence group , it 's not like he just walked into a random pub and the locals started shouting at him . 
  uhg he actually went with the sheeple thing . 
  you can find loads more here if you 're interested http://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3a%22united+states.+army+service+forces.+special+service+division.%22 [ germany ] ( http://archive.org/stream/pocketguidetogermany1944/pocket%20guide%20to%20germany#page/n0/mode/2up ) [ northern ireland ] ( http://archive.org/stream/apocketguidetonorthernireland_845/apocketguidetonorthernireland#page/n0/mode/2up ) [ paris and northern france ] ( http://archive.org/stream/pocketguidetoparisandthecitiesofnorthernfrance1944/pocket%20guide%20to%20paris%20and%20the%20cities%20of%20northern%20france#page/n0/mode/1up ), 
  suggesting that germany has profited at the expense of the rest of the eurozone seems to get them quite angry . 
  it originally meant `` does anybody else '' or sometimes `` does anyone ever '' . 
  then / r/circlejerk started using it for stupid or inane questions [ like this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/search?q=dae+&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all ) but now it 's just stuck infront of a couple of words that sum up a circle-jerk : dae le s [ weed ] en dae ea is literally hitler . 
  i ca n't actually think of anymore . 
  it 's used like that all the time though . 
  looking through / r/shitamericanssay the submissions do n't seem that bad . 
  * in fact the whole sub just seems really petty . 
  it 's just the standard counter-jerk . 
  for the longest time america was vilified and constantly compared , unfavourably , to europe . 
  now whenever anyone tries to even bring up a comparison , even an innocent one , you get the `` dae le s [ weed ] en '' comments . 
  the pdfs have both maps and pie charts , they also have individual pdfs for each country . 
  white trash would be the american counterpart to chavs ( or any other lower-class / underclass stereotypes ) . 
   now that i think about it , he seems to have become way more tolerant of other cultures lately . 
  i wonder what might have prompted that change ? 
  realising that far-right is more electable than extreme-right ? 
   interesting fact : the soviets tried to recruit david cameron to the kgb after he graduated from oxford . 
  apparently he was on a russian beach and a couple of kgb agents walked up to him and asked if he wanted to join . 
  as far as recruitment tactics go propositioning random foreigners does n't seem to be a very smart way to go about it . 
  sorry must have misread it . 
  but it does look like you 're saying that everyone else in europe thinks that italy is pathetic . 
  and the majority of people in italy . 
  noted . 
  edited `` you '' to / r/murica, 
  there was a video posted here a few days ago about french relations with their ex-colonies in africa . 
  i do n't know accurate it was but i found it very interesting . 
  original thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1l0odh/how_france_and_its_former_colonies_use_one_another/, 
  it 's a nice effort and i largely agree with the message that europeans need to stop looking down on americans . 
  but most of / r/murica 's arguments are n't very good . 
  * how should europeans show their `` gratitude '' to america for ww2 / marshal plan ? 
  and why should they be grateful when the majority of the population did n't even live through it ? 
  * britain does not own the falklands , the falklanders do and we went to war to protect their rights to their land . 
  a better example would actually be chagos archipelago . 
  * it 's more a disagreement on what the response to a crises should be . 
  europe looking to america for political and diplomatic leadership is not a signal for the us to do what it wants . 
  * i do n't think america actually do take in more refugees than europe as a whole . 
  from a cursory look at [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_refugee_population ) it says that germany alone takes in more than the us . 
  ( this ca n't be right surely ?? ), 
  i do n't see why it would n't have spread eventually . 
  japan , for instance , successfully industrialised without being colonised . 
  granted this was in response to western colonialism in the region but again i do n't see why technology could n't have spread in the way it does today - through trade . 
  well yes it did do some good but it did more bad . 
  he 's probably referring to this story : http://www.examiner.com/article/englishman-ordered-to-remove-english-flag-on-front-door-may-offend-some and yeah to suggest that this is at all common is rubbish . 
  feeling personal guilt is a bit much but you should definitely recognise that your ancestors did commit atrocities and that you - living in a nation that is the product of those atrocities - ( generally ) benefited because of them . 
  obviously ww2 is different since germany did n't benefit from it but imperialism and colonialism is definitely something that many modern european nations did benefit from and we need to recognise that . 
  if - as the most up-voted comment in the [ last thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1khem1/french_teen_attacked_for_wearing_muslim_veil/ ) about this suggests - she was making it up so the muslim population can pretend they 're being oppressed this is an extraordinary level of commitment .
