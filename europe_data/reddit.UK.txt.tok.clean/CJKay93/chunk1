it 's also different in the uk because foreign students are not eligible for government funding to pay off student loans , whereas the german government is a stakeholder in ensuring the students become an overall economic benefit . 
  the general view in the uk is that the students here are already struggling to find jobs , so why should international students be able to pay their way in under the bank of mum and dad rather than using traditional immigration avenues ? 
  they paid for top tier tuition , not for a permanent route into the country . 
   the investors are the ones who risked their money for the company . 
  not the employees . 
  employees are n't risking their money for the company ? 
  i 'd say that the being made redundant is a pretty big fucking risk to employee 's money , as well as their entire livelihoods . 
  thanks obama !, 
  this is a fantastic idea . 
  i wish they 'd stop calling it a second referendum . 
  a second referendum implies it would be the same question as the first referendum . 
  absolutely agree with this . 
  it should be just as difficult for chinese companies to enter the eu market as it is for eu companies to enter the chinese market . 
  if china wants to play a global game , it needs to have global players . 
  hah , only grade a. 
  uh ... no ? 
  i am literally currently spending this week with more foreigners than native brits ( global conference for work ) and i , personally , think that anyone who says `` multiculturalism does n't work '' does not actually have any experience with it . 
  we are saved !, 
  the gbp has not exactly strengthened despite all the good news it 's been receiving recently , and there has been plenty to be happy about . 
  it 's literally no different to humans overreacting to bad news . 
  the best explanation for the flash crash was that it was an overreaction triggered by an article on hollande talking about how tough the eu needs to be on brexit . 
  so , regardless of the fact that it was a miscalculated move , we now know exactly what the markets think of brexit , and it demonstrates a * huge * , now-undeniable lack of confidence in the pound . 
  the crash was inextricably caused by brexit , just without human oversight . 
  why has this been marked as misleading ? 
  the title means what it says on the tin . 
  if it means i can move to mexico just before the brexiting starts , i 'll take it !, 
  if you 're going to start suing everybody who has watched a movie or television show without paying to do so , you 're going to end up suing a good few hundred million people or so . 
  if it becomes law that viewing unofficial streams also becomes illegal , all those people who googled `` watch < insert show here  online '' are going to be in very big trouble . 
  because my close family is abusive and the strangers have always treated me well . 
  cambridge ... 
  the other reason is that they often come with a really juicy , crunchy chilli that i ca n't find in supermarkets . 
  you ca n't even assume that northern irish people are like [ southern ] irish people , so how is it reasonable to assume syrians are like iraqis ? 
  rule britannia !, 
  i have lived and worked with a number of eastern europeans and , frankly , i 've never had any issues with any them . 
  governments can not just `` easily ban websites '' . 
  look at pirate bay in the uk - numerous mirrors banned ... no effect . 
  and you 'd be right - the article is incorrect . 
  if you 've seen him on any panel shows he 's actually surprisingly humble and quite sharp compared to his performances on top gear , where he plays a total buffoon . 
   he added that he had apologised to the group for brexit . 
  in a union with a population of more than 700 million people , 2 days between * anything * is quite remarkable . 
  he said it 's not worth being done if it 's * not worth being paid for * . 
  as a volunteer firefighter you are doing work that is worth being paid for voluntarily , not doing work that is n't worth paying for . 
  because it 's the name of a terrorist organisation , not a state . 
  i 'm not here to debate the israel-palestine conflict . 
  that 's for an entirely different time . 
  yes , that 's a very good point , and no doubt it depends very much from area to area . 
  i do n't know if there are statistics for those particular areas ( though they 're large enough that i suspect there would be ) . 
  i really suggest you go through each individual statistic and weigh on how severe each one is individually to you . 
  in some cases , france has a much higher x than israel , but in the rankings both of them are rated far higher than the likes of the uk and the us ( for instance in [ murder rate ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/crime/violent-crime/murder-rate ) ) . 
  the problem is `` i * feel * safer here '' does not amount too `` i * am * safer here '' . 
  i have no doubts you feel safe in israel - i would too - but the only reason you should feel unsafe in germany is if you 've been roped into this strange propaganda , because you are statistically * less * like to be a victim of almost any crime . 
  since the year 2000 , there has only been one terrorist attack in germany that has killedd more than one person : the frankfurt airport shooting , which killed 2 . 
  france is a bit worse off than germany , but in general is [ still much safer than israel ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/france/israel/crime ) for the average citizen . 
  you 're not wrong when you say european terrorist attacks tend to have more casualties , but if we go by number of casualties we end in the same position i alluded to in another post where even the us sounds more dangerous - all the terrorist attacks in the uk , france and germany in the entire 21st century do not exceed those that occurred on 9/11 . 
  people also tend to forget that israel is a nation of merely 8 million . 
  germany alone has 10 times that population , and is consequently harder to police internally . 
  on top of that , israel has , internationally , the 3rd highest number of police per capita at 330.1 ( france has 210.2 , germany has 303.8 ) . 
   til claiming israel is safe is ` far-right propoganda ' except that is n't what was said , is it ? 
   israel these days is safer than france and germany : /, 
  please fix the formatting on your post - i have absolutely no idea what you 're trying to say . 
   it does n't matter whether it is true or not ( it probably is n't , i will comments that responded to you below ) , but the fact that you are using pras\u0119 like `` far-right '' propaganda so much . 
  that was what i was talking about . 
  i 've used the term once so far , and it was in the post that you are disputing . 
  i personally believe it is propaganda because : - i can not find any evidence to suggest it is true - i have seen it posted multiple times over the past week by multiple users  it seems that izrael is n't so unsafe after all , even though it was n't my point . 
  i never made the claim that israel was particularly unsafe , i made the counter-claim that germany was simply safer than israel , and provided the relevant evidence to back that up . 
  do you disagree with the sources i have used ? 
  i apologise that the established statistics conform to my `` narrative '' , whatever it is , but here 's the situation : you are demonstrably incorrect on all counts if you genuinely believe you are at a higher risk of a terrorist attack , rape or other violent crime in germany than israel . 
  whether you want to believe those statistics or not is up to you , but do n't then go and pretend you have no such `` narrative '' . 
  what ? 
  it is n't propaganda because you believe it , or . . ? 
  you 've got to be kidding me if you think i 'm going to follow a link from thereligionofpeace.com with absolutely no context . 
  if you 're going to take part in a debate , make an argument and back it up . 
  number of [ terrorist victims in israel ** since 1951 ** ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/terrorism/terrisraelsum.html ) : 2,954 number of [ terrorist victims in the usa ** on the day of september 11 2001 ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casualties_of_the_september_11_attacks ) : 2,996 judging by those two statistics , would you consider yourself more at risk of a terrorist attack in israel or the usa ? 
  it is * still * [ safer than israel ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/germany/israel/crime ) . 
  what on earth are you talking about ? 
  in what context could `` country a is now less safe than country b '' possibly be considered praise for country b ? 
  whether you * felt * safer in israel or not is a complete non-argument - you are * objectively * safer from terror attacks in germany . 
  you can find a list of terror attacks in germany on wikipedia , but good luck finding one for israel - it would be pages long . 
  yeah , uh , that is [ completely untrue ] ( http://www.israelhasbeenterrorattackfreefor.com/ ) and stinks of far-right propaganda . 
  israel is safer than germany ? 
  then you 've got no fucking idea what 's going on in israel . 
  i wonder who 's gon na win the powerball . 
  then why bother bringing up france 's historical border controls if there were n't any ? 
  we are only talking about immigration control because you decided you wanted to . 
  if you 're just going to disregard my answer to your sarcastic comment , why bother with making it at all ? 
  france joined the eec when it was established in 1957 , establishing open borders with other eec members . 
  before ww1 , border controls were scarcely a thing - france actually * abolished * passports and visas in 1861 , and were n't reintroduced until the start of wwi . 
  that means that , in the entirety of modern history , france has had just 43 years of proper border controls ... if we completely forget wwii happened . 
  this is not the responsibility of the west , but you would have to have your fingers in your ears to decide we have not played a huge part in it . 
  keep composed and stay strong , fella . 
  japan does n't have many anything but japanese people . 
  it also has , y' know , quite a large ocean . 
  the problems being : - how do you identify hate preachers without relying on reports ? 
  - how do you deport french people from france ? 
  very good point , as sad as it is to admit . 
   israel is doing a pretty good job at preventing most terrorist attacks on its soil no , this is complete and utter nonsense . 
  france , in comparison to israel , is faring far , * far * better . 
  so much so that there is even [ a website tracking terrorist attacks in israel ] ( http://www.israelhasbeenterrorattackfreefor.com/ ) . 
  something something huge ocean , incredibly strict immigration requirements and not really involved in the middle east fiasco . 
  take back control .
