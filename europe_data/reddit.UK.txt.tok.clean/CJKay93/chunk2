  i do n't know about you but i 'm equal portions both . 
  we literally just told them `` fuck the power , we do n't need it '' . 
  do n't worry , we 're mad at us too . 
  let 's not forget the euro has also dropped dramatically as well . 
  it 's only going to be more attractive for non-eurozone tourists . 
   so as long as the world 's economy remains more-or-less stable woh-ho-hoh ... let 's not get ahead of ourselves here . 
  well ... yeah , in a sort of `` i 'm voting for a because b even though i 'll get c , but it does n't matter because it 'll change d '' kind of way . 
  take an upvote and never make that joke again . 
  the people do n't know jack shit about what free trade even is . 
   one has to look at the ideals of britain and the ideals of the eu and see if they can match one only has to look at the last election to realise not even the ideals of britain and britain match . 
  that is a masterpiece . 
  ooh , i guess that would also explain why i have the eu flag ... 
  i do n't know if he changed it , but now his flair suggests he is definitely not british . 
  marmaris is quite nice from what i recall - i 've been there a couple of times . 
  i do n't know whether it 's been affected by the recent political climate ... but i do n't really want to find out either . 
  a real shame . 
  what a fucking moronic ramble . 
  can someone explain it ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand the meaning . 
  214 points and still 81 % upvoted . 
  they are more visible because the impact of the most recent attacks was much larger than usual . 
  the rate of attacks , however , has decreased , not increased . 
  he explicitly used the words `` far right '' . 
   how many people have ** the far right ** killed ? 
  what point are you trying to make ? 
  - [ western europe ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/thumbs/1300x1300r/2016-12/terror20161220-i2.png ) ( 0.0000003 % chance of dying to islamic terrorism , 0.00000002 % of dying to other terrorism ) - [ the usa ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/files/2016-09/us-terror.png ) ( 0.0000002 % chance of dying from * any * form of terrorism ), 
  vastly less than the more than six million that died to the far right the last time they ran a country in europe . 
   how many people have the far right killed ? 
  about six this week . 
  that was unsurprisingly unsurprising . 
  to be honest i think a lot of * us * feel that way too . 
  [ this is the usa now ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/film/pix/pictures/2012/5/22/1337709078456/the-shining-008.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c8d0a5b09c5b23ad622d6206f5253f19 ) . 
  friends ? 
  share the same political views ? 
  definitely not . 
  age , yes . 
  wealth , no . 
  demographic ... professionals ? 
  to an extent . 
  in the real world , where i am discussing this , literally at this moment on skype , with 30 coworkers from the uk and across europe ? 
  it 's arabic . 
  it 's just `` thank god '' in yet another language . 
   what 's wrong with the goverment ? 
  come on man , really ? 
  the war * began * because of the things that were wrong with the government . 
  683 million rubles ... 684 ... 685 ... 
  good thing we do n't host referend - oh , bollocks . 
  a small part of me hopes it happens , because seeing him fuck it up in full view of the public would be magnificent . 
  the express would n't know what to do . 
  no , that is n't going to stop 100 % of terrorist attacks either . 
  additionally , somebody is not a terrorist until they have committed an act of terrorism , in the same way somebody is not a thief until they have stolen something . 
  are you feeling alright . . ? 
  cpus are * incredibly * complex , but this is in on another level even still . 
  cpus can be revised , bits and bobs taken out and put back in , simulated , emulated ... not this thing . 
  there were no rules against because it was an entirely new situation . 
  re : / r/sandersforpresident , it did n't spend its time shitposting and banning discussion . 
  how and/or why ? 
   # 8.5 bn is net , not total . 
  well , the gross total was # 13bn with the rebate , and # 18bn without the rebate , both of which are still vastly less than # 24.4 bn . 
  what ? 
  no it is n't , total eu cost for 2015 was # 8.5 bn . 
  this is # 122bn distributed over 5 years , which is # 24.4 bn a year . 
  my dad said that about theresa may and now look how that 's fucking going . 
  i feel sorry for whoever has to read my essay there . 
  poland may well into democracy once again after all . 
  poorly worded but ultimately not wrong . 
  putin looks like he 's turned up in [ these ] ( http://www.valleyvet.com/swatches/34988_l_500_vvs.jpg ) . 
  jesus , that sub is a shitshow . 
  i do n't like what 's happening here either ... but i think i prefer it to what happens in the usa . 
  i do n't think people are serious about the mass execution comments . 
  this is n't the middle east - it 's not exactly a realistic outcome . 
  just ... run them all over . 
  we can think about the consequences later . 
  is this supposed to convince people they 've got the right idea , or is it just to piss everyone off ? 
  what are they even protesting ? 
  shop windows and vehicles ? 
  now they 're thinking with portals . 
  poland can finally into the first world !, 
  the fuck, 
   5.5 million interrail tickets handed out to 18-year-olds , along with travel money  every year , all eu citizens reaching the age of majority would receive a free interrail ticket along with 3,200 euros in travel money to start them on the road to adulthood . 
  this would be a fantastic idea if you could guarantee most of it actually went to foreign economies . 
  nope , only virgin here . 
  not that i 'm complaining , i only really care about the download and it actually usually exceeds what i pay for . 
  well , no , it 's only fttc . 
  afaik there is no ftth here yet . 
   usually modern fiber internet has symetrical down/up . 
  i have n't seen this anywhere in the uk . 
  my virgin fibre is 50/3 . 
  why are you backing up your server over 4g . . ? 
  in the light of brexit i support indyref2 , but they * really * fucked this one up . 
  every fucking day it was , as if they had literally nothing else to be doing . 
  election month , and a terrorist network is currently being uprooted - i suspect , judging by the fact that these guys had fake bomb vests , that they were in a hurry . 
  my apologies - my phone 's autocorrect does not save obscenities . 
  jesus , did his comment even pass through your brain before you shat out a reply ? 
  yeah ... it 's a shame we lost the referendum anyway . 
  sweet jesus . 
   pensions may rise more slowly and they could lose a # 300 fuel payment  i have worked for 50 years and never claimed anything in my life fucking morons , these people . 
   `` a lot of my friends use their winter fuel allowance to go on holiday . '' !?!, 
  ah , we had a different drink for each nation ( or most of them ) , where the goal was to finish before the song ended . 
  christ alive , swedish cider is not my thing .
