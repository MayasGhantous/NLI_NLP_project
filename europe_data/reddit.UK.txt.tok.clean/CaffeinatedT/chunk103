  you have no right to bring up free speech when you 're so inconsistent . 
  because it does n't simply start overnight this is the effect of this kind of rhetoric and its escalation . 
  your argument on the other hand is pedantry and semantics about individual words rather than acknowledging the substantive effects even when i give you an example . 
  apparently you 're fine with it as you seem to be absolutely terrified of defending the free speech of anyone to express ideas without threats except for a heavily government supporting newspaper . 
  which as said i think your support for free speech could be seen as ** somewhat ** selective here . 
   saying a whole race of people , or any person `` needs to be eliminated '' goes beyond free speech . 
  ok so anyone not blindly following the daily mails rhetoric on brexit [ for example ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed555f203c3e08b53ac63ff47dfb80d7db2bfe5/0_4_934_560/master/934.png?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2cleft&amp;blend64=ahr0chm6ly91cgxvywrzlmd1aw0uy28udwsvmjaxni8wni8wny9vdmvybgf5lwxvz28tmtiwmc05mf9vchqucg5n&amp;s=57e7afa54a9fc6e9ae8fc1271cf03674 ) . 
  so when you going to start standing up against hate speech captain free speech defender ? 
  that is definitely not how orgies work lol . 
  yes i mean imagine if someone shot an mp shouting death to traitors or something like that ? 
  as said i 'm not sure if its intentional unwillingness to look at the broader picture or genuine ignorance but when a certain type of rhetoric is pursued ( e.g if a major publication started saying the jews need to be eliminated and that was echoed by it 's readers ) only fools would then say `` oh well but they are n't literally firing up the gas chambers now so it 's not a problem '' . 
   you 're obviously uncomfortable with free speech but apparently anyone speaking out against turning our country into mini 19th century america is a traitor . 
  so you can fuck right off there with the false `` protector of free speech '' act . 
  free speech is protection of political speech not of commercialised hatred . 
  especially as the government is echoing a lot of this `` saboteurs talk '' and allowing it to happen then if you love free speech so much you should be speaking out about this . 
  if the best youve got is `` russia and turkey are further along the same path '' then thats kind of my point . 
  leaving aside the made up hilary policies ( completely unsourced as usual ) . 
  now trump ` standing upto assad ' ( aka a v expensive photop to distract from corruption investigations ) is a good thing now ? 
  hes spouting hilarys policies that trump fans were saying would start ww3 and how trump was a non interventionist . 
  do you have no sense of embarassment lol ? 
  more like we already knew his critics kept turning up dead for years . 
  this is ` just another one ' unfortunately . 
  only vote wasted is a non-vote . 
  but yeah noone does i dont think other than people who think theyre benefiting and are too cynical to care about the long term ramifications or how it caused brexit . 
  aye its a legit point if you define it as that . 
  doesnt change that our system isnt anything close to one man one vote but ill concede it plays out worse for more repeesentative and niche parties in the us . 
  well if u define it as you are neither do the americans either . 
  but realistically when vote value is so unequally distributed between parties then its a hard label to avoid . 
  even if it moves from labcon to libcon its still a two party system, 
  ah so it 's different when it 's islamic people then ? 
  you say they 're all held to be collectively accountable for their mental/extremist people but it 's different when it 's someone mental/extremist who believes x and y and is n't muslim ? 
  im in berlin so a lot of peoples experience of brits is drunk stag parties lol . 
  indeed , i 'll hope people do n't forget what reactionary politics looks like when it 's allowed to fester . 
  ah ok so i can criticise the headline then because it does n't make up a large part of our political discourse calling people traitors and remoaners ? 
  or you mean that it does represent their readers but no-one is allowed to draw parallels with the attitudes seen in authoritarian societies ? 
  which is it ? 
  ah ok so that kind of debunks the brexit argument of posters like [ this ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f510b25581c993fae11fe42817a9c6d3780f376/0_305_5049_3029/500.jpg?q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9f48e3c7b1adcf6ca86f292fd45618f2 ) where all muslim refugees are terrorists waiting to kill us all and eat our babies then i guess . 
  that or they 're massively inconsistent for ** some ** reason . 
  i live in germany and do n't like football or binge drinking which seems to blow plenty of minds . 
  hence how ( for example ) ukip can get 12 % of the country voting for them and get 1 seat . 
  if you think fptp is fair you either have n't counted or you 're deluding yourself . 
  problem being that stuff like the current situation arises from the majority of the countries votes being worthless . 
  i 'm not even particularly left wing . 
  as said i 'm pointing out the parallels of uncivil discourse claiming the opposition are all traitors and it 's echoing by readers of said publication and politicians . 
  your response is  you are truly a fucking idiot . 
  either get over the fact that people are going to point out the bollocks or make an argument rather than just thinking you can shout down people with abuse and harrasement . 
  you 're a perfect example of the lack of civility that i 'm criticising . 
  why did you insult me with nothing constructive said and then then continue harassing me in pms u/madlogician ? 
  i have the right to point out the bollocks of uncivil discourse from a paper read by thousands and echoed in our political discourse . 
  end of story . 
   from madlogician sent 14 minutes ago not replying on / r/europe due to low karma , but you did n't make an argument , you made an assertion . 
  you sound like a kid who uses words he thinks a smart person uses to make himself seem clever in primary school . 
  grow up . 
  and here 's you pming me to tell me how smart you are and try and insult me some more . 
  cool mate . 
  reported . 
  great answer . 
  so informative and totally dispelled the argument and made you look smart . 
  french person sticking up for english and being pedantic on z 's and s 's now i have seen everything lol . 
  they 're also not turkish . 
  however this same attitude towards democratic engagement in civil society is just as dangerous to a democracy . 
  the fear is n't what 's happening now but what happens in the future . 
  for example a less extreme example the us did n't become a country where trump can be elected overnight . 
  it takes years of rhetoric from the media and conservatives saying how democrats are all socialists coming to take your guns and immigrants are coming to kill you etc etc. 
  the current political climate there did n't just magically appear one day it 's been an escalating thing since the days of reagan . 
  likewise turkey did n't just turn into the current situation overnight , it 's taken years of rhetoric about traitors , a coup and the resulting crackdown on other opposition and the slow takeover of the media by erdogan and his cronies for what now happened . 
  authoritarian personalities are what accepts it and enables it whether it 's in the us , russia , turkey or the uk or wherever, 
  `` ok chaps the cunning plan is we 'll tell them that slough is london and send all the bombers there . 
  two birds with one stone '' * rapturous applause *, 
  i 've never seen anything close to this in german media myself ( i work in germany ) even the bild at its worst does n't come close . 
  this is kind of an escalation even for the uk as well in fairness . 
  before the last election where ed miliband was labelled a communist and anti-uk it very rarely got to this level unless it was immigrants or paedophiles involved or anyone else who got to be a target of the two minutes hate . 
  good counter argument there . 
  `` shut up '' . 
  kind of summarises the problem here that you seem to feel you 're entitled to a happy little bubble where no-one can disagree . 
  `` everyone loves brexit , anyone who does n't love brexit is a traitor so they do n't count '' . 
  what 's wrong ? 
  i 'm agreeing with you on your plan , we wait till the same rhetoric of the political opposition being traitors lands us in the same position and then we start criticising it . 
  sounds like a smart plan to me . 
  i 'm at work now i have a very interesting and rewarding job working with computers . 
  but hey let 's not let facts get in the way of a good bit of trying to demean a point by attacking the person . 
  surely that will convince people of the strength of your argument . 
  ah ok so we 'll all excuse the exact same behaviour from a paper that influences large swathes of the country until it degrades civil society to the point that we 're the same as turkey . 
  sounds like a good plan . 
   victim complex , wah wah the party filled with racists constantly involved in racist scandals got called racist once in a while . 
  and apparently everyone else has a victim complex . 
  therefore that justifies vicious campaigns against the political opposition by the media . 
  and then your arguments get so weak all you can do is insult me and claim i belong to group x or y. 
  what a crybully . 
  when were they called anti-democratic and/or traitors ? 
  name one time they were subject to genuine abuse from the media on this scale ? 
  and then when were they subjected to it day in and day out ? 
  get fucked trying to hand-wave and equivocate . 
  do i think that casual spreading of `` oh refugees do this this and this '' or myths about `` oh yeah the immigrants get council houses first '' get casually spread through societies from papers like the daily mail printing what they print day after day year after year without any challenge ? 
  absolutely . 
  and does loads of people thinking that group x commits crime y have an effect ? 
  yes . 
  or do you think people just one day thousands of people all simueltaneously and completely spontaneously decide that * insert group * are all rapists/criminals/welfare scroungers whatever ? 
  they were against our membership of the eu for 40 years . 
  the fucking anti-democratic traitors .
