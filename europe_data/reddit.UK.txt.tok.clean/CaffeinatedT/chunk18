  honestly that 's the cover . 
  but the moment we get years deadlines restrictions on govt benefits etc it 'll just be the next thing . 
  whenever you get to the core of the argument it 's about `` sovereignty '' and `` the uk is fine on it 's own '' and `` special trade deal '' etc etc. 
  even if the uk got absolutely every concession it wanted there 'd still be papers banging on about it to their readers because they 're scared of anti-monopoly legislation . 
  relative to 2001 pre-emptively invading countries yes but i 'd hardly argue the uk is even close to isolationist in terms of foreign policy and diplomacy . 
  perhaps theres a `` not touching that with a bargepole '' attitude to eurozone matters like greece but even things like refugees where it would have been easy to nope out of it the government has done a huge amount in the fact of a lot of political pressure from the public by working in the camps themselves ( arguably the superior policy considering the political pandoras box that 's opened in germany ), 
  pedantically you 're right i guess . 
  i would n't set any hard rules but pretty much anything where we 're talking about a large expanse ( larger than the horizon ) amount of salt water , sea and ocean are pretty much interchangeable in my head . 
  is there a joke i 'm missing in here somewhere ? 
  eh alter/alda du opfer = only sentence you ever need . 
  kinda makes sense . 
  combo of the scandi accent and more tv shows/global culture is american . 
   anglian accent after hanging out with english folk !, 
  how was hanging out with alan partridge ? 
   many italians expect if they go abroad that people will speak italian wow imagine if some other group was so embarrasimg as to expect everyone to speak their language : o, 
  it is a stopgap , i agree it would help , but it would also just fill up again . 
  it would be like trying to fix a leaking pipe by filling up buckets . 
  there 's also ( as always ) a political cost to taking a big bunch of the people with sharp elbows . 
  as said there needs to be action at the other end otherwise even more people would be encouraged to come because `` hey they 'll give in again anyway '' . 
   lack of enforcement ? 
  those people would 've found one way in or another , even the ddr did n't or the dprk does n't manage to keep their people in i think you and me would both agree no system is ever going to be 100 % effective . 
  but this is pushing people away from the sharp elbows illegal approach of a lot of the economic migrants . 
  we both agree that we should be giving a better route for asylum applications but at some point you do have to get rid of the ones who are n't valid and say `` no '' . 
  this would be achieved through containment of failed asylum seekers and spending on deportation flights and procedures for those who refuse . 
  i agree with the last point there should be more legit routes . 
  however my point was ( on calais in specific ) that if it was 100 % refugees from syria , afghan etc , us taking more asylum seekers from camps and doing everything perfect , would remove the issue . 
  but it wo n't because it is mostly economic migrants from not those countries . 
  those ones are caused by poor enforcement of borders and lax deportation and registration procedures . 
  i mean ... what 's the ** real ** racism here ? 
  me blindly declaring a racial group are all monkeys ? 
  or the person who calls me out for being a racist when i say racist things ? 
  that 's what asylum applications are for . 
  in effect they interview you and determine if you are at risk due to war , your views , homosexuality etc etc. 
  that is what makes you eligible to claim asylum . 
  i 'm a bit confused , as i say at the moment the uk are the ones leading in actually taking asylum seekers from refugee camps and incentivising people not to make the crossing . 
  i 'm used to being hysterically accused of saying `` let them all in ! '', 
  by nutters but here 's my view . 
  at the moment the quantities are low but that can change . 
  i agree that we should take more and set up centers outside of europe and take asylum seekers from camps but that is something everyone would have to do . 
  that ** would ** i accept do something for the calais problem for a certain amount however the large majority of calais is not asylum seekers these are economic migrants . 
  this would not be affected by taking more external applications . 
  they already have an application system for this [ here ] ( https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/work-visas ) . 
  they should be applying from outside of the uk . 
  and people should not be jumping the queue or trying to game the system this way because they know their application is bunk . 
  in my opinion we should 've spent more money on enforcing this in the mediterranean . 
  the only legitimate route should be through refugee camps or legitimate application . 
  calais is an example of a failure of that . 
  why is letting them all into the uk going to actually help anything though ? 
  how is the uk just saying `` oh well screw it we give in '' going to help anything . 
  if we set-up a good system to ensure we do n't just get more piling up next week then perhaps it would be prudent to dismantle the camps and take a one-off batch and process their applications . 
  but setting a precedent without actually stopping the flow just means more will come next time . 
  the lack of encforcement has resulted in what should be a pretty good and just asylum system being lumped in with the economic migrants thing , overwhelmed by numbers and now becoming subject due to political pressure . 
  and then the racists jump on with blanket condemnations like `` they 're all rapists '' , `` they all just want hand-outs yaddahyaddah '' and we have the current situation we have now . 
  to your point i do n't think that calais correlates with people being taken from refugee camps . 
  they will mostly continue to come as they were not the guys who were going to be taken from camps in the first place . 
  i 'm not going to rush to blindly condemn all as the same like many here and i am ok with taking in real refugees ( i live in germany at the moment myself ) . 
  but if you give pisstakers and chancers the advantage then you 're going to get the pisstakers and the chance and they will force out those actually in need . 
  not quite sure how that 's directly our fault rather than a large immigration inflow into europe . 
  in my opinion countries should be doing what we do and collect real asylum seekers from real refugee camps in the conflict area rather than allowing queue jumping by the wealthy . 
  what do you think is the cause of the issue ? 
  it is quite nice but as france shows even with all the advantages we have there 's still thousands of them in calais constantly trying to come through and many succeeding . 
  it 's more prudent to work with the whole of europe rather than just yell at the french when the problem ends up on our doorstep . 
  edit _ e.g posted a couple hours ago https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/40qgow/migrant_crisis_coach_full_of_british/, 
  i would n't say pride . 
  but generally ( emphasis on generally as it 's hugely variable ) ex-british colonies that kept most of their institutions are pretty under-represented in terms of global basket cases so it 's a bit less `` embarassing '' as a whole concept until you start digging into individual atrocities . 
  already not in schengen . 
  so back in your box dumb dumb . 
  for once we can claim to be the smart ones by as we 're already dealing with stemming the flow by working in the actual countries and taking in the vulnerable from camps . 
  `` la la la no no no this is n't happening '' on the other hand does n't solve shit , although it gives kids on the internet something to make shitty bants with i guess . 
   of course that would be a lie . 
  if thousands were involved ( across the various cities ) , and only a tiny fraction were arrested never mind still in custody , no , deportation will not happen for the vast majority . 
  so how do we improve that ? 
  arrest people who were n't involved to make-up the numbers ? 
  at the end of the day you can only deport as many people as were arrested and are convicted of a crime ( well not without going down a pretty worrying path ) . 
   `` police will do its best to protect people at such events . 
  however , the people must take ultimate responsibility for their own safety . 
  the law permits even lethal self-defence if you fear for your life or severe injury . '', 
  i think that 's a seperate debate entirely on self-defence law but this is already part of the law . 
  the differences are in the definition of `` fear for life and safety '' but as said that 's a different debate . 
  but the police have said that they will be taking specific measure against such actions in the future seeing as they were spread thin and unprepared at k\u00f6ln as it was a completely new thing . 
  i 'm not sure what else they could do though . 
  `` this was an unforeseen event . 
  we will be watching for it in the future and taking specific precautions against it , and deportation is likely for the guys who did this '' is pretty much all you can say . 
  what else are you going to say exactly if you 're the police ? 
  `` we 'll round up some brown people and kick their heads in to send a message to the rest '' or `` we 'll arrest some randomers and stick charges on them till they 're aquitted by lawyers and we 're back to square one '' ? 
  in fairness there 's a strong point here . 
  none of this would have barely made it anywhere without social media a few years ago . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's a good thing or a bad thing anymore as on the one hand we would n't know about the incident , on the other hand a ) the police would know and would be taking much the same precautions and we would n't have this lynch mob shit going down . 
  i 've got mixed feelings overall . 
  hands off approach has worked fine every other year in germany . 
  as said it 's a party atmosphere and you ca n't just lock down the whole country . 
  what should have happened was a bit more presence on the hauptbahnhof but a ) there would be accusations of heavy handed police presence b ) the attacks likely would have been happened somewhere else anyway . 
  honestly the welt article does n't really say a huge amount more about it than the rt one ( i live in germany though i 'll save the full translation i 'm a bit distracted at the moment by other things . ), 
  - german police authorities are going to take visible actions gegen stuff like cologne especially to reassure the public who feel a lot of insecurity after incidents along with the tensions created . 
  - next paragraph is them talking about bigger presence at protests events and a bigger emphasis on watching out for thise stuff . 
  - final bit just says it 's been known before in germany but it 's often accompanied with handbag etc thefts and valuables etc. 
  as said nothing really outside a police press release accompanied with stuff everyone knew already . 
  mainly it 's useful to hear the police reaction going forward . 
  i do n't think we can actually know that as the people have n't been apprehended yet . 
  but if they are apprehended and proven in a court of law to have commited the crimes then over a years sentence and they absolutely can be deported .
