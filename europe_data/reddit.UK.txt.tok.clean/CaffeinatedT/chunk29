  everyone else copes fine . 
  c ) push the eu on it 's border control , and do n't do what we did before and block their attempts to control borders by saying it 's a start of an army or whatever . 
   anyone who invested heavily in the uk-eu relationship in the past couple of years , what a risk only because of the uk in this relationship . 
  we 've been a post-fact loose cannon since the av votes with the baby posters . 
  and our inequality levels made us a ticking time bomb . 
  fortunately we had the eu and finance to cover up those deficiencies and if there is one plus side to this whole farce at the moment at least the government has actually had to confront this weakness in the uk for once . 
   when we hit # 1 : $ 1 i 'll be printing money . 
  i 'm loving it . 
  i get paid in euros and my student loan is getting cheaper . 
  just not really so great for my family back home . 
   i 'd argue its just as important , you 'd be incorrect though . 
  it is not as important as the four pillars of the free market . 
  those are what allows the eu to function and solve the free-rider problem . 
  as said this is the same as trying to argue a state bylaw is as important as the first amendment in american law . 
  leaving aside that i do n't know the details on this and if it is as clear cut as you say or if it is another of the many fudges that happen on day to day law . 
   i agree , the precedent it sets is terrible . 
  but either they get special access for the sake of the economy and the eu fractures , or they do n't get special access and the further derailed economy causes the eu to fracture . 
  i 'm sorry but this is delusional thinking from brexiters about how much effect brexit will have on the eu . 
  the uk is not the only country to buy german cars . 
  and is a 27th of every countries trade theoretically . 
  leaving aside that if uk businesses leave to europe or end up disadvantaged then that actually advantages the continent in some ways . 
   a stupidly crafted monetary union without a fiscal union , which is doomed to collapse anyway . 
  ok i 've spent years and years of dm reading aunts and uncles saying this and not bothering just to keep the peace . 
  and now my countries been fucked because people were allowed to just spout crap without knowing what they 're talking about . 
  just putting `` stupid '' in front of a description of something does n't make it stupid . 
  what is the alternative proposed here ? 
  because a full political and fiscal union is an eu superstate that eurosceptics freak out about . 
  and a basic free trade agreement between states is crap when people want that market integration . 
  if you say somethings crap for a reason , but then that solving that reason would make it even worse then it 's pretty obvious you do n't actually have an argument or a good plan you just do n't want something to exist for emotional reasons . 
  and unfortunately that is n't how the world works that throwing a tantrum means other people should stop doing what they want . 
  in my opinion ( and feel free to counter and disagree ) but those are the only two visions that exist and do n't rely on everyone else collectively shooting themselves in the face as a favour for us . 
   given those two alternatives , however , does mean that enough people might change their opinion from brexit to bremain to make a democratic difference i do n't think so either and i would n't want them to reverse this either . 
  we clearly must brexit there are irreconcilable differences politically and the uk does n't want to be part of a wider european project that is the eu . 
  however what was n't voted for was the removal of british peoples rights as a sop to the demands of a screeching minority of brexiters . 
  the leave campaign created this situation for themselves by refusing to outline a clear plan . 
  hardline brexiters wanted a hard brexit , which they know would 've lost in a fair fight . 
  so they made lots of noises that we 'd still be in the single market anyway and there would n't be consequences in order to make up the difference . 
  then once they won they 're trying to sneak in the full hard brexit through the back door and regarding the single market as a disposable asset . 
  except that initial strategy is now falling apart because they did n't do the groundwork of actually winning an argument for a clear cogent strategy other than `` leave the eu '' . 
   and this is why you do n't hold a simple majority vote without giving the voters clear options . 
  well leason learned indeed . 
  problem is the only person who needs to learn this lesson has already left politics and fucked off into a cushty director job already . 
  the tories need to learn to put the interests of the country over their party squabbles and politics but they are n't going to learn that either . 
  and the public are n't going to learn a lesson about not believing everything you read the papers . 
  so this is all just looking like a pointless and painful exercise where the main effect is a bunch of families all falling out with each other over christmas . 
  and if they do n't ratify it it will be for reasons that it does n't actually make sense what they 're doing . 
  no-ones asking anything crazy here they just want them to make clear that they actually understand what they 're negotiating and to drop this silly delusion that because we 're british we 're going to get everything we want which is patently not true . 
  the post-fact stuff in a campaign i 'm bitter about because i do n't think it 's fair one side can just make stuff up unchallenged but that 's fine it 's over now . 
  the problem is that is n't a viable way to conduct this negotiation . 
  no amount of yelling `` we need you more than you need us ! '', 
  is going to help in negotiations . 
  and if anything proper scrutiny actually makes them more legit and have a stronger mandate from the whole country rather than looking like a bunch of people rushing stuff through before anyone can challenge what they 're actually wanting to replace our current system with which seems to be the whole brexit approach at the moment because they know this ukip vision of brexit is n't going to work . 
  one thing that 's not been talked about here but if i was a brexiter it really would n't fill me with confidence that may and davis have been claiming some amazing super cunning plan up their sleeve for this special deal they 're going to get for the single market when they 're getting their fingers burnt legally just on basic points of british law . 
  everyones been saying they 're completely wrong and misreading the situation but they 've been acting like they 're playing 4d chess . 
  and now they 've shown that they do n't know how to play before they 've even started the game . 
  if they want this amazing deal and they 're going into a negotiating room still not understanding the basics of what they 're arguing about they 're going to get absolutely ripped to shreds by properly ideologically motivated negotiators from the eu , this was just a neutral court . 
  it 's probably a good thing for brexiters too that this is scrutinised and challenged by some people who are n't as ideologically blinkered as david davis or as politically blinkered as may . 
   the eu 's rules do n't ever apply when folks do n't want them to , though . 
  i mean , for example , look at how many times germany has violated the sgp with its enormous surpluses . 
  you can argue about this till the cows come home but no-one of the 27 nations left is going to agree to the uk getting a special exemption to the core principle of the eu in perpetuity . 
  especially not as a reward for leaving . 
  it 'd be like if the south seceded and then they still got the benefits of being in the united states plus they were allowed to have slaves . 
  what you 're talking about with germany is n't on the same level this is like a local law versus the constitution in its importance . 
  and germany is n't the one negotiating a new arrangement with the eu where the eu can just say `` bye felicia '' whenever it wants . 
   kicking the uk out of the single market because `` its the rule '' would be shooting the eu 's economy in the foot , as the uk is the largest export market for the rest of the eu . 
  yes it will hurt the uk , but it 's not as if everything will be rosy across the channel . 
  as said though it is n't spiteful behaviour it 's self-interested behaviour . 
  if the uk is allowed to leave and get a better deal then every country should leave to get what they want and then the whole market collapses and everyone loses . 
  or they follow their own rules and each seperate country takes a minor hit ( remember the eu is n't one country ) . 
  this `` they need us more than they need them so give us special treatment '' argument is a really really fundamental mis-reading of the situation and if anyone goes into a negotiation with that as a core assumption the uk will get absolutely spanked . 
  it 's strange as once the economic argument got spanked brexiters were saying `` it 's about more than money '' , but apparently they ca n't see the same thing happening when other people do it . 
  be extremely worried when every institution of the eu and every single state all agree on something for once . 
  there are two and there only were ever two . 
  soft brexit , we leave the political project on integration that is the eu , make our own trade deals , stay in eea meet our obligations as single market members on development funds ** and ** eu freedom of movement . 
  lose political power at eu level that we clearly dont want anyway as a public ( wrongly in my opinion but ho-hum ) . 
  we prioritise immigration , we lose single market membership . 
  we have to re-enter the wto and get agreements on schedules from every member of the wto . 
  try and do a fta etc to minimise the damage . 
  we are out of the eu and the single market and everything is rather shit , but we do have less polish people . 
  those are the two versions . 
  i 'm obviously biased to the former . 
  parliamentary scrutiny means that they have to actualy pick one of these . 
  which is good for everyone because this delusion of both that 's being allowed to fester without ** any ** reality based scrutiny will destroy us more certainly than either of the first two when they go into negotations and get slapped to death . 
  the brexiteers should be wondering why an eu that is always so chaotic is so united on this at both eu and at the countries level . 
   it means parliament has to vote on enacting article 50 and for example if the government dropped this silly immigrants over everything priority approach and gave some assurances that they actually recognise why the four freedoms are important then you think they could n't win said vote ? 
  screw it i voted remain but i 'd be fine with it if they 're actually going to deal with this in a reality based way rather than playing up to delusionals and stopped the pretence that this is a negotiation on stuff that is n't going to be negotiated on . 
  the 52 % who voted to remain will still exist tommorow and in my opinion we probably should be out of the political project that we are n't productive in anyway , we should just be honouring our obligations as single market * members * as well in a soft brexit . 
  even if 52 % becomes 40 % tommorow there is a large part of our country that does n't feel the political project serves us . 
  and just like the 48 % who voted remain should be ignored , neither should the other side . 
   farage ca n't win a seat to save his life and ukip are looking more and more like imploding on a daily basis . 
  i 'd be very careful about thinking that means the eu dissapears as an issue overnight though . 
   the biggest thing is this could delay things until a general election . 
  i think this is n't a good approach . 
  this is a mirror image of what the brexiters have been demanding screeching that we should rush through article 50 without any scrutiny before anyone can think about it so their political ideology is in place irreversibly before anyone can challenge it . 
  this brexit thing needs to be solved to a point where a ** real ** majority of the country is happy with it ( as in 70 % or so ) . 
  and hoping to delay itit like this ( leaving aside that it 'd likely still be quite strongly for brexit ) is n't going to solve it anymore than yelling `` we wun get ovr it '' is going to solve it . 
  something else that only exists in europe is the comprehensive single market of goods and services that our economy is based on though . 
  free trade is what everyone else has and is n't the same thing . 
  which again is why people need to read the bloody manual . 
  that 's the point .
