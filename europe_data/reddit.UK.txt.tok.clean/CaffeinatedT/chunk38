  hell kirchensteuer in itself is a pretty religious quirk especially when `` catholic '' friends of mine get pinged for it because they did n't know about it and said they were born in a catholic parish . 
  out of curiosity what 's their expected `` process '' for the refugees now ? 
  i thought it takes ages for them to get accepted as refugee after getting to country and applying , then to get a work permit , then complete language courses then find work . 
  i know small shops/bakeries etc are taking in a few around here in berlin but i 'm not sure what the expected cycle is meant to be or what the govts targets are . 
  hey let 's not get all factsy here ok . like people who actually live there know more or have a * clue * what they 're talking about . 
  let 's just stick to breitbarts version of the world . 
  this poll is extremely vaguely worded  another 60 percent said they were in favor of letting girls and women wear a head scarf at schools and universities which is forbidden at france 's secular public institutions . 
  i 'd agree that the state should n't be regulating clothing myself too if you asked me in a poll . 
  does n't mean i reject western values . 
  there 's a lot of laws i do n't agree with in germany where i live as a brit , i still follow them but i think they 're bullshit and would say so if asked in a poll . 
   the poll found that 20 percent of male muslim respondents and 28 percent of female muslim respondents were in favor of the face veil , the niqab , and of the burqa which covers both face and body . 
  again what percentage of non-muslims think this too ? 
  no need to have the debate again but i 'd hardly call this a rejection of western values and more a rejection of this specific policy of regulating religious clothing . 
  again `` being in favour of '' is quite a strong specific statement compared to `` understanding of '' or `` not against '' etc. 
   when asked if they considered the islamic legal and moral code of sharia to be more important than the french republic 's laws , 29 percent of respondents answered `` yes . '', 
  what does this actually mean though ? 
  i personally think freedom of information is more important than anti-whistleblower laws that are actually law , however i still follow the law . 
  likewise someone can think their religious law is more important and still follow the law . 
  if 30 % of people genuinely do n't act within french law and only according to sharia then that 's a huge number of people , way more than seems to be indicated even by the most extreme impressions . 
  not sure what else one can call religiously guided laws like sunday trading , anti-gay marriage , anti-abortion laws , anti-contraceptive pill laws etc. 
  theres a difference of magnitude granted but just acting as if this is some unique evil muslim thing is simply wrong or lying . 
  that is pretty shocking . 
  possibly more worrying than the looney minority who actually think of genocide it 's the fact that people have lost so much tolerance that they would n't really object so much . 
  this is something i heard whispers of and i do notice a lot of friends who work in poland are still able to afford the same holidays/lifestyle etc as myself and other friends working in germany on supposedly a quarter of the income . 
  but i kind of assumed that was a small companies thing is this normal ? 
  well in case of things like firefighters etc it works more like insurance than a direct payment so the metaphor isnt quite perfect as this would be more than if they paid fair share split between all . 
  you clearly missed the brexit thing . 
  i do find it funny that its unemployed basement dwellers and angry left behinds of who are the biggest burden on our british economy talking about how everyone else sucks and riding on the coattails of the productive people who overwhelmingly voted remain . 
  i 'll be honest i 'm not sure how i can phrase it better without exclamation marks around the bits where i imply the police are in league with the media ,, 
  i err , think you missed the bit where im taking the piss , the police are n't magically reporting more hate crimes to the degree that it makes a story just to create a story they do n't give a shit . 
  illegals = / = non-natives we have a huge number of people in the uk who have lived here longer than i 've been alive ( many who 's families are actually 2-3 times longer than me ) . 
  i also care about illegal immigration for the usual reasons of queue jumping and documentation . 
  but it 's hard to apply the same criticisms to ( for example ) pakistani-british people . 
  there are problems within the communities ( e.g rotherham everyones favourite ) but they are n't the same issues and you ca n't really put them under the same umbrella of `` le refugees '' ( of which we only have a handful in the actual uk itself ), 
  the evidence say not if you make up enough scare stories or sensationalise any normal crime done enough . 
  if you take some daily mail articles on polish people from a few years out and remove polish and replace it with muslim you could pretty get the same sounding witch hunt as the one from right now with muslims . 
  you can be the epitomy of well-behaved , integrated and well documented etc but if you end up on the end of a media hysteria run people will hate you . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  this is like me bringing up 9/11 in reference to a school shooting . 
  and then when you say it 's irrelevant i say `` oh you 're defending it then are you !? '', 
  you must understand there is a difference between discussing an issue when it 's relevant and conversations with the alt-right in the uk where it seems to go like `` so what are we going to do about the eu ref-rotheram '' `` so are we in favour of a grammar schools system or continuing the compr - ** rotherham ** `` so lovely weather we 're having recentl - ** rotherham !!, 
  pedo ray guns !!, 
  ** '' it has fuck all to do it with it , seriously the problems of pakistani communities who 've been in the uk since before the eu existed and have nothing to do with the eu or the current upswell of xenophobia against eastern europeans . 
  nor is it some systematic white genocide lol . 
   my gods , you chavs ( ? ), 
  do n't actually know , do you ? 
  we spent years in the uk nodding along to our clueless grandmas/uncles/aunts / siblings just waiting for uninformed people to shut up and then the brexit thing happened , i now will openly mock people for saying stupid stuff and have a damn good time doing it . 
  i 'm free to patronise people as much as i want because they `` won '' and are pretty shoddy winners compared to the tolerance shown for the last half century . 
  `` mass rape '' lol , jesus you seem to have some pretty big insecurities on getting laid you got anything you need to talk about there ? 
   brexit is about confronting an existential threat , and all you nobs ( is that a correct insult for y' all ? ), 
  talk about is the economy . 
  nah it 's knobs lol , can think of a few words for you but that would be getting off topic . 
  existential threat lol , jesus christ just because you 're angry ca n't get laid does n't mean no-one else can . 
  and i 'm curious how us leaving the eu will solve an integration issue from people who 've lived in the uk before the eu was even a thing ? 
  or do you think pakistan is part of the eu lol ? 
  i am also curious how you 're linking rotherham here , you 're saying a polish chap got jumped by a load of muslims as revenge for rotherham being punished or something ? 
  luckily i 've seen enough of the world to know that not all americans are actually as feckin dumb as stereotyped but you are doing a bloody good job of making up for it . 
  p.s if you never had a passport you 're as british as i am feckin chinese you 're as bad as the plastic paddies . 
  smh ca n't believe you actually used the word `` stock '' jesus christ . 
  what a plonker lol . 
  ( there 's a new word for you there m ' breddrin  ), 
  * irrelvant rotherham rule * drink three fingers !, 
  in seriousness , leaving aside how shit that `` point '' was ... is that it lol ? 
  love these loops you 're tying yourself in now . 
  `` immigrants are a large contributor to our society and wealth and have been demonised by a careless right wing media '' = racism '' and apparently the real hate-mongers here are the people who criticised hate-mongering in the campaign for political points and are now criticising the consequences that they previously warned about . 
  jeeessus tityfegin christ would love to see a mind map of this logic . 
  either way , you can call remain voters the `` real '' racists all you want but every single statistic and every piece of evidence proves you wrong . 
  because they 're freaking out that it 's been reported in the ops least favourite paper . 
  apparently quoting primary sources puts it on the same level as the sun or some other of the many papers that spout the kind of shit that causes this . 
  but rather than be outraged at that , better to be offended at the people reporting it . 
  i 'll risk it , but yes i am joking . 
   by immigrants against british people , of which there is a lot . 
  no there fekin is n't , let 's have one single fecking source of this or anything intelligent on why immigrants would suddenly attack british people for remaining . 
  where 's the years of tabloid fabrications and distortions being pumped at immigrants via right-wing leaders ? 
  where 's the constant politicking by tories trying to pick up the racist vote ? 
  the equivalence you 're scrabbling for is like night and day . 
  to me it just sounds like another deluded brexiter clutching at straws trying to avoid the blame for the consequences that your were warned about when you throw your hat in with these types of people . 
  spraying made-up bollocks everywhere or trying to blame the people who did n't want to do this is n't going to smokescreen it . 
  yes and the police are in league with the newspapers fabricating increases in reports and crimes . 
  it all makes so much sense now . 
  yeah and that just happened out of nowhere . 
  just like how loonies all hate muslims all of a sudden like magic and just like how everyone used to hate jews randomly . 
  you 're right there is never any demagoguery or hate mongering involved beforehand . 
  that 's the bit i 'm finding funny , the tabloid papers getting all shocked that after years and years of [ this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3467569/judge-lets-romanian-rapist-britain-break-eu-law-deport-home-country.html ) type of outight distortion or [ this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3335689/how-50-000-migrants-came-uk-romania-bulgaria-just-one-year-figure-19-000-year-given-right-work-freely-britain.html ) type of scare story . 
  suddenly they 're all shocked , ** shocked ** that people take it seriously and see eastern europeans as the enemy . 
  it 's exactly like how the sun went from `` vermin '' to `` omg the poor dears '' on syrian refugees when that kid died . 
  [ source ] ( http://indy100.independent.co.uk/image/9537-18qo4ov.jpg ) as said if you as a random person reading this ever believed any of this crap and/or repeated it on the internet , you are part of the problem and part of the reason why these mongoloids felt like attacking some random dude going about his shit because he was foreign . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  they both report the same facts . 
  are you being triggered by facts or something ? 
  nothing , easily led people and the media who sell papers to them on the other hand ... 
  brexit would n't have won or been such a large movement for years without pandering to them there is n't a way any of the brexit leaders are going to disown them when it 's one of their core support groups . 
  you voted for this anti-fact rubbish , do n't say you were n't warned . 
  and every time people do n't condemn this anti-fact hate rubbish it it 's going to keep going . 
  let 's hope no-one else mentally ill gets wound up into shooting someone again eh ? 
   way to miss the point completely . 
  you really want specifics everyone who 's heard brexiters bang on incoherently has always wanted specifics . 
  and every single time we ask it 's dismissed as being negative rather than realistic . 
  that 's how you get into a position where you `` win '' an argument and then every solution proposed get 's shot down in flames . 
  kind of amusing that we 're demanding not to be stereotyped based on the actions of our scum after years of stereotyping of poles , romanians , bulgarians and pakistanis by our press and various post-fact/alt-right types .
