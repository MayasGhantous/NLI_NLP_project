  that 's how post-fact politics was created because no-one civil calls it out for fear of appearing rude . 
  tl : dr it has to come from civil society and not a government imposing their truth on us . 
  indeed there are many other stupid arguments as well . 
  but that 's one of my favourites . 
  why do i have to be open minded when i 'm presented with something verifiably dumb ? 
  i 'm open minded there are good arguments for brexit . 
  just not very many and they 're more arguments towards brexit lite . 
  and they 're not the ones the stupid people are advancing . 
  do n't act like it was even a majority of people who voted along the lines of daniel hannan or similar . 
  all working class people = / = all leave voters = / = stupid people you patronising metropolitan anti-working class elitist . 
  ok i 'm being facetious but my point is you have as much right to stereotype , claim to speak for , and insult the working classes to serve your political purposes as jeremy corbyn does . 
  aka sqrt/fa, 
  that was my understanding yes ( i also think i 'm allowed to vote in my local council elections ) . 
  but if i was a `` citizen of germany '' then i have the right to vote in everything surely ? 
  legally i would be as german as hanz reinhardt - schnitzelwurst living next door who was born in bavaria and walks to walk in lederhosen every day . 
  is that not similar in austria then ? 
  i thought the point was once you 're a citizenship then the game is over and you are exactly the same as everyone else ? 
   if you 're gone for too long from germany , you 're also not allowed to vote there for anything except the eu parliament . 
  similar in the uk if you 've not been resident for more than 15 years you ca n't vote ( a fact that many found quite controversial in the recent referendum ), 
  indeed , and there are already are many bodies and organisations doing this . 
  just they were airily dismissed as project fear or biased as well . 
  we add in another layer and the same would 've happened again as well . 
  these people just want to be spoon fed what to think and that 's far more damaging for democracy than any personally formed decision even if i personally disagree with it . 
  you 'd be surprised how short people have one cases for . 
  and the right to family life is an incredibly strong one as well for people who have family etc. 
   and if there is a cut off they 'll have to start keeping records of eu immigrants entering after that point . 
  ah yes that 's one i left off but yes it 's the elephant in the room as well to elaborate , if we arbitrarily make a cut-off then we 'd have to completely and utterly overhaul our tracking system of people going in and out of the country and living in it . 
  there 's currently no distinction between coming on holiday or to work and there 's no record of people leaving either . 
  and unlike many for example you do n't have to register any residence against your name . 
  so you could pitch up tommorow and if you were ever in the uk you could just say you 've been living here the whole time . 
  tax system would be one way to verify this but even then you just say `` i was living on a friends couch etc '' . 
  so many holes to go through . 
  this is another one of those pesky realities that a lot of people seem to be in denial of because they do n't understand the technical details outside of `` we 'll just do x '' i personally really think we ( and everyone ) ** should ** be tracking people leaving as well as entering but it 'd be a tricky argument for people to have to queue up at passport control to leave the country as well ( although i have some ways i think you could automate this checking against the record that came in ), 
  as far as i know i and any eu citizens already can vote in some local elections and eu elections ? 
  if citizenship was granted then ( which i really have n't heard credibly yet ) then by nature as a `` german '' i can naturally vote in all elections ? 
  do you mean citizenship or did you mean niederlassungserlaubnis type stuff ? 
  the important word here is credible . 
  while i love david davis as a politician , on the eu in a theme following the brexit campaign he 's saying shit he either knows he ca n't do for popularity , or he 's got less knowledge of the law an average as level law student he ca n't tear up law ( e.g in this case freedom of movement ) and then apply them retrospectively just to deport people . 
  ** even if ** he can tear up the uks legal principles here and take a big dump on our security and stability as a responsible country ( fuck it we 've done already with this brexit thing ) we 're still signatories to the human rights act which makes it very hard indeed to deport even genuinely shitty people due to right of life let alone non-terrorist supporting working people living in the uk . 
  it 's unlikely to happen . 
  granted it 's horrible and it 's embarassing for me to look at as an immigrant in germany but even in the most extreme case of residency rights being unilaterally revoked ( and a lot of the current appointments look like a covering exercise for softening views and forcing brexit to face up to verifiable lies they told ) the echr would most likely cover existing eu immigrants anyway ( as it does all people under rights to family and rights to life . ), 
  ok even more extreme action ( and at this point this is way beyond the point of practical for may just to kick out immigrants ) we revoke the echr authority but the ehra as a piece of legislation ca n't be removed and then applied post-hoc to deport existing citizens . 
  so yeah i get why people are worried but they probably should n't be in my opinion . 
  stupid people believing tabloids is why . 
  source ? 
  that sounds pretty far-fetched to make announcements like that seeing as we have n't even started negotiations yet . 
  i 'd be pleased as an immigrant in germany but i do n't believe it outside of a couple of `` we should ... '' type things from the greens and random non-power controlling people . 
   with talk in the uk of deporting recent immigrants post brexit who 's said anything credible about this ? 
  i voted remain but this is complete hysteria . 
  can we stop calling them working class and just call them stupid ? 
  everyone keeps running around justifying stupid views by saying what `` the working class '' think when `` working class '' people do n't think with one hive mind . 
  many living in areas where they benefited voted remain and vice-versa . 
  but if you voted to leave the eu because you think that would somehow make everyone muslim in the uk evaporate then you 're verifiably daft as hell no matter if you 're on jsa or landed aristocracy . 
  i ai n't racist but it 's the eu bringing those pakis in everywhere init . 
   many are saying the feel cheated by voting leave . 
  honestly these are the only voters i have genuine contempt for . 
  leave voters who wanted to leave the eu for stated reasons , even if i think they were complete bullshit i can relatively respect the opinion . 
  if you took an informed decision and genuinely thought the rewards will outweigh the risks then i think you 're wrong but fair enough . 
  these people who were so fucking stupid to just go along with what was said in the campaign and not do any research or check any facts should lose their right to vote forever . 
  i almost wish boris johnson told them they could fly so they 'd jump off a cliff . 
   if the uk government can not give them the funding they need , they wo n't , absolutely 100 % gurantee it . 
  i 'm sceptical there 's even going to be a raise in their funding as there 's so many other more vote winning/losing things that need to be covered after a loss of eu funding . 
  that 's the point i 'm following along too . 
  people are getting all annoyed at second third generation kids of citizens and somehow wanting to introduce special rules just for certain unpopular groups rather than treating all citizens as equal . 
  except of course no-one wants to admit they want to discriminate openly . 
  so wait someone ca n't communicate clearly that is somehow on me ? 
  fuck yourself numpty . 
  in the context here i would be considering the groups as seperate in terms of their porportion , ak if young people make up a large porportion of voter make up than normal then i 'd absolutely argue that 's a significant effect . 
  ok so improve the citizenship test then on first generation immigrants . 
  but are we going to then require each subsequent generation of turkish kids to re-test ? 
  and then when do we stop ? 
  i get the emotional response to islam but the problem is when we start moving around the goalposts around constantly just for one group of people ( e.g retesting constantly over and above usual citizenship procedures ) then it starts to get ridiculous . 
  and when you say `` islamist '' what do you mean here ? 
  turkey is moving that way definitely but it 's not an islamist country and when the original turks came here in the 60s it was pretty much the text book example of non-islamist . 
  this islamist angle is something from the last 5-10 years or so tops . 
  i got ta admit personally i actually kind of agree that all citizens should be required to test on civic values before being allowed to vote but that 's just my own thoughts . 
  i think there 's plenty of people who have views incompatable with democracy ( including believers of political islam ) but as said until i hear a practical definition on how to test for this anti-western view amongst muslims outside of `` looking muslim '' then it 's a pretty crap policy in practical terms even if it sounds like common sense . 
  far better to judge based on actions and then take action after proving it than take some arpatheid type path . 
  yes it absolutely is . 
  as said above take the 100 young voters versus the 900 young voters . 
  80 % of the selected young voters can vote . 
  meanwhile the 900 other voters turn out is 40 % . 
  the weighted average turnout of all voters is lower even though among one group it 's on average high . 
  ________________ 100 * 0.80 = 80 '' weighting the 100 young voters average 900 * 0.40 = 360 '' weighting the non-young voters average 80 + 360 = 440 '' total amount of value * frequency / 1000 voters = 0.44 % '' divide total amount of value by the total frequency . 
  converted back into a percentage . 
  _________ as you see here the high average young vote is n't necessarily reflected in a lower average vote . 
  edit : added in a simplified version of the maths on how this works . 
  that 's perfectly possible 18-24 % = x % 24 -35 = y % 35 - etc = z % so and so forth then you take the sum of each group and you arrive at your final score . 
  to put it another way i would do the maths but i 'm a bit busy but if you have 1000 eligible voters , 100 between 18-24 and 75 of them vote you have a 75 % turnout amongst young voters , meanwhile every other groups ( the remaining 900 ) turnout is different then the average turnout while be different . 
  indeed , as said . 
  pricks . 
  but i 'd describe anyone who acts that twattish over football as such . 
  i 'm not so freaked about people identifying with their former country as i am about people being pricks about their current country . 
  which as you described their definitely are some proper chuffers out there and i 've seen them about as well . 
  i 'm not sure how you 'd design a process for them or what you 'd do about them but there are plenty of prickish german born lefties in berlin who act similarly ( e.g rigaer riots from last weekend ) so again not sure how to seperate it out . 
  although to take that specific case i 'd say if someone acts like a prick about football in the uk i 'd say they 're pretty damn well integrated into the uk . 
  yeah it 's fair enough , as said plenty of french and english speaking people do n't completely integrate culturally either so i 'm not too fussed on that . 
  economically is the big one as that 's where if you do n't do it you start getting people completely living on the edges of society and being a burden on everyone else . 
  i 'd argue economically is what allows you to integrate culturally and politically if you 're a taxpayer + able to afford to do things . 
  that 's the biggest first step to take .
