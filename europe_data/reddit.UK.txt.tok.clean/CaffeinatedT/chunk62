  why was infrastructure so underinvested in ? 
  why are british workers so under-skilled ? 
  why are there huge pockets of deprivation outside of london and huge population density within it ? 
  reducing immigration on its own is n't a policy success unless it 's a means to something and what is the goal here other than to appease daily mail readers ? 
  because reducing immigration is n't going to fill in the existing infrastructure issues . 
  oh jesus is this `` they need us more '' thing still going around ? 
  they may prefer to have us around for the reasons stated , , but not enough to basically create an incentive for others to leave and destroy their own market . 
  `` come on chaps , we 're ** british ** why are n't you all shooting yourselves in the face for us as a favour ? '', 
  if i recall amusingly you 're the chap who thought the eu was forcing truck drivers to work longer hours and that if we brexited then they were going to ** improve ** workers rights if i remember lol . 
  so forgive me for not taking your angry opinions very seriously . 
  how 's that great brexit workers rights bonanza looking these days ? 
   any normal country outside the eu has the right to reject low-skilled economic migrants if they 're unable to contribute to the level that is required . 
  and any normal countries are also free to make an agreement where they allow free movement between them . 
  within the context of the eu it was decided that it was a mutual benefit of all the states to set this up so they set up the framework for that to happen in the context of a single market where capital also flowed between countries . 
  just saying `` its not natural '' shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the eu and what 's going on . 
  and this is the big problem of the brexit thing they 're still not understanding what the eu is , it 's an agreement between countries not some attempt to `` defy the laws of nature '' imposed on us from space . 
  and statistically it was overwhelmingly beneficial to us . 
  so rather than saying `` it 's normal for countries to reject immigrants '' we should be being honest and saying `` we 're leaving an agreement that was beneficial for us because we dont like the stories about gypsies in the daily mail '' . 
  and in this respect there are precious few good arguments for trying to sabotage this genuine benefit for citizens . 
  and the ones that there are were easily mitigable by enforcing rules that were available to us and not having a government that did n't take the extra money and squander it on tax cuts for their friends . 
  to put in a personal word as an example i pretty much owe my career to eu movement i guess . 
  it was not needing a visa that allowed me to apply for a traineeship position as an equal in germany . 
  with requiring visa sponsorships etc there is fuck all chance of that happening . 
  the uk was doing fuck all for me and offered only unpaid internships and the experience/no jobs cycle in 2012 or so . 
  that was an opportunity and plenty of others like me have done it in that time period as well - from that point i developed and am now what you would call a skilled professional . 
  but just saying `` just put in the graft '' or saying `` skills '' over and over again like a buzzword is a sanitisation of the word `` only posh people with the educations and skills to get specific visas '' . 
  to shit on the advantages we had for the sake of problems like the daily mails evil benefits abusers that were easily fixable is just plain mental . 
  especially when one has 0 clue as to the situation of the uk even next year let alone 5 years . 
  this just smacks of `` i did n't take advantage of it , and fuck everyone else who did they must be weird anyway '' . 
  lovely as this sounds as a gesture a ) why would the other countries agree to it when it does n't do anything for their citizens ? 
  brits get to travel and work freely in europe but their citizens ca n't work and travel freely in the uk ? 
  if i was on the other end of that i 'd be telling them to get intercoursed pretty damn quickly without some pretty amazing incentives . 
  b ) why would they effectively undercut the anti-brexit movement in the uk by giving everyone who voted remain a get out card ? 
  c ) why are british people getting treated special again ? 
  apparently we ca n't even literally vote as a country to leave the eu without some special treatment happening to help us out from the eu . 
  d ) why would n't every other country then demand this thus effectively turning the eu into spotify or netflix ? 
  i 'd be all over this if i was a eurosceptic populist . 
  e ) selfishly as its from my pov but as i live and work in germany already i 'm surely already paying for the eu through the taxes i give to the german government ? 
  surely it 's kind of bullshit to be double taxing people for the upkeep of the eu surely ? 
  and if i 'm getting double taxed then i 'd better be geting a bloody vote on it . 
  and who 's going to administer all of these subscriptions and memberships ? 
  f ) also then if i do get a vote why do n't americans and everyone else who pays into eu tax coffers also get a vote ? 
  and then we 're back at no taxation without representation again which seems like a can of worms we do n't want to open right now . 
  and if we start determining eu at the citizens level then that 's going to create a truckload of legal shit . 
  if i 'm honest i 've really never thought of myself as english . 
  british is pretty much an extension of english identity anyway . 
  perhaps i am an example of this smashed identity thing but i ca n't name anything really `` english not british '' apart from a few local customs , gin , and football hooliganism . 
  hence why it 's the scottish and the welsh etc who want to have an identity seperate to that because a lot of them do not want to have their identity being with the queen and westminster etc that 's all english stuff though which is why i do n't quite understand where the `` oppressed english '' meme came from originally before it morphed into the `` you ca n't even say you 're english anymore '' silliness . 
  if i 'm honest the main annoying bit for me is this big thing on r/europe that all scottish people are lovely european tolerant types and all english people are football hooligans when the countries do not share some magical `` cultural seperation '' e.g this `` scotland is a nordic country '' guff from people who watched braveheart once . 
  i 'm actually quite curious on what affects this . 
  e.g is it actually an outcome of just having large manufacturers and tech companies based in small countries or are these imported researchers or is this all coming from domestic researchers at domestic institutions etc ? 
  good for romania that 's what actually taking back control looks like and not just handing over your country to a coalition of big businessmen and right wing loonies . 
  good for them . 
  no it is n't . 
  mob rule , irrationality , anti-free speech and intimidation of opposition is what you see in every proper shit hole country . 
  post-facters should be moving to african and arabic dictatorships as they love those kinds of politics so much . 
  as a german taxpayer , everybody should be playing by the rules . 
  being rich enough to pay for tax evasion schemes does n't mean you get to avoid shit no matter how much you try and dress it up in santised words like `` oh its just avoidance not evasion '' etc. 
  go to hungary or the czech republic and say that . 
  fuckin russian nats smh lol, 
  i was wondering when all those polish people got so tall . 
  [ burn ? 
  nah it 's a mild bit of summer colour mate ] ( http://cdn.emgn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7.jpg ), 
  meh , skins waterproof i do n't see the issue . 
  if i 'm honest i can take or leave it , i voted remain , i 've been abroad a couple of years and i 'm skilled enough that ths visa crap for brits this is n't an issue for me aside from the embarssement . 
  i really do n't give a shit about the ideological culture war of triggering liberals or whatever . 
  as said the bit that i 'm challenging constantly is the delusions and even worse is the malice . 
  if brexit had n't been accompanied by this alt-right undercurrent and if the angry people hadnt taken over and now shat all over democracy and civil debate when they were in the ascendancy i would have just said it was a quirky amusing british thing . 
  i am always going to challenge post-fact bollocks and this `` everyone is queuing up and everything is great ! '', 
  bollocks is exactly the same as trump and his `` alternative facts '' ( tellingly also both backed by breitbart and their lot ) . 
  it 's very un-british and we 'll be rid of it in a few years . 
  every bloody time people point things out they get told to stop acting like its venezuela or some ridiculous thing . 
  as said that is great for our export industry , sort of ... 
  but our export industry relies heavily on imports as well in turn . 
  again for example `` we 've had larger changes '' the main larger change being the recession . 
  which is n't exactly a great thing . 
  i know a lot of people are ideologically bound up in this now but this race to decry anyone for pointing out what is happening is doing more than anything else to stop any sensible discussion . 
  we 've had way too many pub-metaphors or massive simplifications in this debate and people seem to wear it as a badge of pride to just spout what their favourite brexiteer says . 
  the evidence speaks for itself that we 've gone from `` this is a fucking great idea ! '', 
  to `` stop pointing out the iceberg and get on it with it ! '', 
  and eventually they 'll just blame each other or say `` well why didnt anyone warn us '' . 
  well these are all falsifiable statement . 
  at some point one has to say `` ok they were very clearly bullshitting '' rather than just wringing their hands and giving everyone a participation medal in thought . 
  well we have a pretty bloody good idea what happens when your currency collapses and your diplomats go around pissing everyone off and your only hope is clinging desperately to a man with 0 loyalty . 
  not really no . 
  if we had an effective opposition that was actually going to hold the government to account for planning to turn the uk into a low-tax wasteland for normal people then perhaps it would make a difference . 
  as it is though this will be waved through and then we 're pretty much depending on how hard we can suck trumps & cos cocks for how we continue economically - which even in a best case scenario is an 8 year strategy . 
  350m for the nhs my arse lol . 
  the problem we 've got at the moment is brexiter diplomacy seems to be modelled on someone at a funeral walking around waving their dick around and then getting angry at everyone for daring to object or be offended . 
  worth noting as well i and half the country did n't want anything to with this self-castration and we especially did n't want it to turn from not just from a castration but into a bunch of guys who are clearly having subconsciously dealing with some [ penis issues ] ( https://twitter.com/parlyapp/status/823562824995704832 ) trying to act like we 're negotiating with india in the 19th century except with all the diplomatic aplomb of david brent . 
  this brexit thing was sold as a minor political and now it turns out ( as predicted ) that it 's actually ukips and the tory wet dream through the back door ( as predicted ) . 
  yes but those are hard to do . 
  it 's much easier to silence any critics and then claim everything is great to your mooing followers . 
   first he says more money should be put into nato ( by europeans specifically ) is a legitimate criticism  the whole thing is obsolete . 
  is just thoughtless sloganeering guff . 
  especially for the reasons he gives . 
  it 's like the difference between `` obama is a flawed progressive president for reasons x , y , z '' and `` he 's the worst president ever and he 's a muslim !, 
  you could make that argument about nato or echr or the un or any organisation that takes actions without the 100 % co-operation of 100 % of its members . 
  i 'm not sure what your point is amongst the goalpost moving . 
  i 've given you an answer to the question why cant it just be voluntary co-operation without any enforcement mechanisms , i 've told you because it 's a shitty basis for long term co-operation , and now you 're going off on other topics that are whole other discussions in themselves or just spouting out buzzwords like `` globalists '' without actually saying why or what the issue is .
