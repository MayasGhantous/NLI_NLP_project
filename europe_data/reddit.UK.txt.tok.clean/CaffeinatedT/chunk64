   cos they do n't spend any money . 
  sure , none at all . 
  love how when its us we 're suddenly all rational , but when its poles in the uk suddenly we forget this argument . 
   uk is ready to afford the rights 3.3 m eu citizens , but it appears not all eu nations are yet prepared to return the favour for the 1.2 m uk citizens in the eu . 
  no matter how many times that lie is told people are n't going to magically forget who voted for brexit and who started these negotiations and is desperately scrabbling for negotiating chips . 
  people like me abroad dont want to be used as some limp excuse for the brexiters to fuck around with the lives of foreign people . 
  go find that source and lets all have a look then . 
  and not just the breitbart article saying it , the actual poll its based off that they mis-used and then idiots spread around the internet . 
  because this kind of polling and `` jew beats up child '' was used against jews as well . 
   why ca n't everyone just be nationalist and take care of their own ? 
  they are , this is what it looks like . 
  people are reacting to their way of democratic rule-of-law being threatened by reacting against people like trump/putin , and their various lackies within europe who just want our societies to be led by baying mobs whipped up by demagogues . 
  i 'm embarassed as a brit right now that we fought against fascism but apparently our country is destroying itself over some peoples hatred of a religious group and ability to be manipulated . 
  i feel opposed against these dictators and authoritarians too . 
  i dont feel european particularly , i just hate bullies . 
  indeed . 
  as said though a lot of countries try to treat them seperately , as , e.g with polish and romanian citizens and the kerfuffle that caused . 
  theyll always try and squeeze round the rules . 
  ok but as said thats something they do ( and we havent even talked about the fact these are certain specific areas yet ) . 
  i dont like it personally but you said yourself why this is . 
  if people arent breaking a law then they arent breaking a law . 
  i mean the idea of you being so outraged at what was also a norm in the west till feminism became a larger force is kind of interesting . 
  id agree more should be done on encouraging women into work and independence as well as enforcing laws over religion in schools . 
  but im not going to get so bent out of shape about it whenever i walk home on sonnennallee in germany where its similar . 
  as said i really struggle to be as outraged as you that men hang around at a certain place . 
  do you go along to a wetherspoons at 10 in the morning on a weekday as well to be outraged at the men hanging out there too ? 
  if they banned loitering for brown people would that make you happier ? 
  id like to think the csu arent stupid enough to think they have any appeal outside of their rural bavarian bubble . 
  but ive been more than surprised by the stupidity of angry people the last year . 
  stupid people dont understand complexity and arent evidence led . 
  there i said it . 
  well mathematically as they pay in more than brits in tax in the uk then we should be treating eu migrants better thsn brits if we go on your system . 
  `` sharia no go zones '' sure thing mate . 
  i 'm guessing we can look forward to this same video being published every week under a different headline in breitbart and reposted here in the lead up to the french election . 
  well the important part learnt from the us and uk is whether these people actually vote . 
  because the ideologues and the gullible will be out for this in force if we 've learnt anything . 
  no it has anti-brexiter bias because they just spent the last year being dickbags everywhere . 
  go read any thread on basic incomes or none brexit related issues and people are perfectly willing to criticise the eu viciously for being backdated . 
  much like brexit though people tend to gang up on people who come along saying that co-operation is shit and their countries are all basket cases etc. 
   ukraine is in south east russia . 
  you 've not heard `` they need us more than we need them ! '', 
  or `` german cars ! '', 
  once ? 
  jesus you should read more and write less . 
  but they 're experts , we hate them . 
  unless they 're bringing good news, 
   europhiles in this sub ( who make up the majority ) get over it mate some of us can take a joke or two but this whinging is getting ridiculous from the people who brought the term `` remoaner '' to the world . 
  stop expecting to be patted on the back for easily debunked nonsense . 
  give it all to the british armed forces . 
  even harder brexit when we invade . 
  to quote r/the _ donald btfo, 
  as said everyone is the same . 
  what 's the big issue ? 
  why so much hatred for people who have also paid into the system and met the conditions the same as anyone else ? 
   it 's people like you who was always insisting putting every other fucker first , that caused a huge portion of the population to vote leave . 
  you did far more damage than any rag like the dm could have ever done . 
  lol nope , stupid people not knowing what they 're talking about and building their beliefs off of that caused it . 
  do n't act like if everyone had kept silent on your ignorance that you would n't have voted the same way . 
  prime example right now of you first saying `` i 'm not racist but '' and then banging on about how polish and romanian people should be treated as second class citizens no matter if they pay taxes and play by the rules or not . 
  british sense of fair play is dead it seems , killed by angry little englanders . 
  ** everyone ** has to be resident/pay-taxes/pay whatever for * arbitrary number * . 
  british or not to access the system . 
  that 's how everyone else does this and is why they dont have nearly the same problems ( leaving aside they also dont have the daily mail pumping out bollocks at thick people ) . 
  does n't matter now anyway as we ( or at least 52 % of us ) fucked ourselves into being trumps cock-sleeve/tax-haven thats got a snowballs chance in hell of doing it . 
  so well done there bet you feel clever . 
  in fairness , does n't the us and pretty much everyone try to do this anyway even under obama ? 
  trumps a prick but this is pretty much standard procedure for countries to try and get better deals . 
  e.g canada and us were causing trouble treating countries as seperate in visa terms . 
  you mean the people doing victory laps and slagging off europe for not being amazing and smart like us get the piss taken out of them while the people who dont act like massive cock-ends get some mild jokes and dont run off crying ? 
  worst thing about brexit as someone who moved abroad has been the constant embarassment of `` we r britush bulldogs '' type bollocks . 
  if you 're living there , learn german , way too many people here who think being a tourist is the same as dealing with bureaucracy . 
  i remember laughing at a polish guy commenting on a breitbart thread about how `` as a gay man '' he was scared to come to berlin because of breitbarts `` sharia death zone '' rubbish . 
  cue much hilarity . 
  because it was discriminating against particular citizens because the daily mail told us to ( just as you'e doing now ) . 
  everyone is equal in terms of rights as citizens ( hence the term ) . 
  therefore we set the system to it is equally fair for anyone . 
  the whole point of the system is to stop dolts like yourself making policy based on their own prejudices . 
  and as well they would bitch , why would an equal partner accept its citizens being treated as second class citizens when they pay in the same taxes and follow the same rules as everyone else ? 
  this is why were off on this retarded goose chase because people like you objectively dont have a clucking clue what youre talking about . 
  lolol dey so triggered rite now me fel smrt , hilary r wurmonger ** vapourised by nuclear bomb **, 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/universal-basic-income-robots-eu-meps-unemployment-mady-delvaux-stehres-european-parliament-a7527661.html quick follow up on ubi for you . 
  how many mps proposed this so far ? 
  we already could have a ubi right now and base it off of 18 years residency in the uk ( effectively restricting it to citizens ) , or make it 5 years contribution in taxes , make it contributory based like most european systems . 
  or any number of single solutions . 
  again why are [ finland ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/finland-trials-basic-income-for-unemployed ) and [ holland ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/netherlands-utrecht-universal-basic-income-experiment/487883/ ) and likely other eu countries doing it before us ? 
  and leaving all of that aside why is your resentment at the idea of someone foreign claiming it so much that you would set aside a sensible policy proposal ? 
  hell even juncker has floated ubi in the past as a long-term solution , the likelihood of an eu wide basic income is far higher , especially now that borders are being secured and the uk is n't going to be blocking eu border forces or armies etc. 
  chances of a basic income in tax-haven wangland is the square root of sweet fuck all . 
  if you genuinely wanted ubi you 'd be voting for a party looking to introduce it , not giving your mandate to the usual bunch of eurosceptic ideologues who are now looking to turn our country into a hollowed out americanised husk for rich people to park their money in . 
  as it is , you 're either lying through your teeth on what you want dressing up `` i hate immigrants '' with `` yeah but cuz i want basic income '' type progressive words , or you 've had your pocket pissed in and been told it was raining . 
  it wont stop it though . 
  its just virtue signalling thinking that knee jerk reactions against immigrants will somehow stop the undermining of workers conditions . 
  at best even if the mountains of evidence are incorrect then youve done bugger all against automation which is the bigger issue . 
  why doesnt this happen in other countries in the eu ? 
  aka `` getting rid of red-tape on landlords '' . 
  it means cutting enforcement of housing regulations and occupancy allowing this . 
  yet again why is this not such an issue in other countries ? 
  as said if you wanted this solved vote for proper enforcement of our rules and a govt that will invest . 
  so fuck parliamentary sovereignty now then ? 
  thank god we left that undemocratic eu .
