  but of course being informed on the topic and not believing in unicorns is called `` moaning '', 
  `` i do n't know ... anything ... '', 
  because you can make a lot of money if you 're the person who owns shares in the healthcare company and/or getting a nice lobbying position as the person who greased the wheels . 
  that costs money though !, 
  we need investment that does n't cost anything !, 
  then why did not make it part of the tenancy terms or one of millions of other solutions rather than racist assumptions ? 
  no-one is saying there 's a problem with the practical outcome ( even if it seems a bit petty compared to other things tenants do , and fuck it people are allowed to live in their own flats they pay for the shit that we put up with in the uk is just hilarious ) . 
  the problem is pre-emptively saying `` they all do this , ban them '' . 
  it 's about as stupid as assuming someone black living in an apartment is eating watermelon and fried chicken all the time . 
  leaving aside that plenty of south asian people do n't like to eat curry every fucking day ( it 's not exactly the healthiest thing ever ) . 
  that 's not cricket in the uk just as it 's frowned upon to say `` we 're banning all bulgarians because they 're all criminals and they 'll trash the place '' . 
  stop trying to excuse it . 
  even if a bigot uses the most pc term possible his actions are seperating people out into groups based on his prejudices and treating them shittily based on who they born to not who they are . 
  for starters it 's dumb as hell i cook curry about 3 times a week as a white `` propa ' english '' brit as do many others who cook a lot of disgusting forrin ' food, 
  right but how does any of this translate into bargaining chips ? 
  we 're going to threaten our own security to make a political point ? 
  not to mention it kind of shits all over the whole `` we want to work with europe '' schtick if as part of something that we decided to do we start threatening everyone in europe with undermining security in europe . 
  it 's a non-goer hence why no-one credible has even suggested it without getting slapped down in about 5 seconds . 
  indeed but saying `` the city will leave '' is very complicated . 
  undeniably a lot of direct european banking that needs to be in the eu will slowly leave but that 's pretty low level stuff . 
  but there is a hell of a lot of stuff that does n't really give a crap . 
  and those people need stuff like the lloyds insurance market which insures a lot of governmental debt and they rely on global reinsurers based in london etc etc. 
  i 'm sure there will be damage but it will be much longer and slower than would be relevant to negotiations . 
  we 're not going to stand down our military or intelligence though that screws ourselves too not to mention completely destroying any diplomatic credibility we ever had . 
  the best real card/asset is the amount of financing and liquidity the city of london provides to european governments and im not sure how that can be used as a threat seeing as its a suicide tactic . 
  spiegel ; `` aww shit you got me , i 'm being paid by the space jew-lizards '', 
   now with regards to britain , yes you can get a variety of different food , but the quality was nothing to write home about in my opinion . 
  i think the main thing is that you have the choice to buy world beating meat or the cheap shit . 
  that 's the main bit i miss in germany you have shit and not shit and that 's about it ( ok not shit does n't mean bad strictly with good cooking ) . 
  outside of the finest restaurant or doing a crap load of research on butchers i ca n't really find very high quality meat in the normal day to day supermarket ( although as muh as i 'm shitting on it lidls rib-eye steaks are actually generally pretty ok for $ per kilo )  cadbury is cool , but i believe if the british were less devoted to their chocolate it would have a much smaller market share cadbury is a very bitter story for the british but it got taken over by an [ american company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cadbury#acquisition_by_kraft_foods ) a few years ago fired a load of people and cut down the levels of cocoa in the chocolate ( aka what makes it actually taste of chocolate ) and did all kinds of shit to screw up the taste moving it towards american shit chocolate ( having said they totally would n't ) . 
  if you want to be trigger a lot of brits go into r/unitedkingdom and ask them if they prefer cadburys chocolate before kraft took over or after . 
  yeah fair enough i guess you 're right there if we assume are actually moving to visa free travel for everyone in the eu anyway, 
  i love your optimism . 
  i 'm aware , but because of our more lax registration and control systems we have a much larger problem with tracking visa over-stayers and illegal work than usual and this has been a big issue with non-eu immigrants already . 
  we were already bad at enforcing eu rules on deporting people who are n't employed after a certain period of time anyway ( hence causing a lot of the tabloid freakouts blaming the eu ) it seems like this is opening ourselves up to pretty much the same situation as before . 
  and we have n't even touched on the fact that the eu definitely would care about people and goods going the other way into the eu from the uk via ireland . 
  it seems to destroy the control of the borders of both the eu and the uk leaving us in much the same situation as before . 
   the uk already lets multiple people come to the uk without a visa . 
  for example , brazilians can come to the uk without a visa . 
  once we leave the eu , anyone from the eu will be able to come to the uk without a visa , just as we allow brazilians to come to the uk without a visa . 
  yes but we check them at the border of the uk before they are allowed to enter the country or they have to have a british/irish visa to travel freely between the two . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/freedom_of_movement_within_the_eu/common_travel_area_between_ireland_and_the_uk.html ) . 
  as said the big issue here is that no-one is checking people or registering people coming from the eu after freedom of movement ends . 
   the ability to enter the uk without a visa does not give people the right to work in the uk . 
  we do not allow brazilians to work in the uk without a visa . 
   given that someone from france will be able to enter the uk without a visa post brexit , i am not sure why you think they would bother flying to dublin then getting the bus to belfast rather than simply getting the eurostar . 
  because if you 're a romanian beggar and want to go into london but ca n't get a visa for example then you just go to ireland and take the backdoor into the uk hassle free just the same as when we had freedom of movement . 
  i 'm ok with freedom of movement as i guess you are too but it kind of seems to defy the point of controlling our borders if there is a back door for anyone with an eu pasport anyway whether they 're simple tourists who we 'd let in visa free anyway or the most dodgy of people who we probably would n't let in normally if we have `` taken back control '' . 
  as said it kind of undermines the whole point of control if there 's an entry point to the uk that only requires an eu passport whether we like it or not . 
  i think i 'm not making myself clear here i do n't as said i do n't understand how we can have a common travel area without being in freedom of movement . 
  hypothetical case here to illustrate my problem with this . 
  eu citizen wants to go to the uk without a visa ( to work or whatever ( beg , steal and eat babies according to daily mail ) ) 2 . 
  they use their passport to go into roi on eu freedom of movement as they 're entitled to do 3 . 
  they cross the border into nothern ireland ** unchecked ** thanks to the uk/roi common travel area as they 're entitled to do 4 . 
  then they take the boat to mainland britain ** unchecked ** because it 's the same country as they 're now entitled to do in the uk . 
  outcome : immigrant in the uk to work illegally/beg/eat babies etc but completely ** unchecked ** by ukba . 
  when we just had a big referendum about taking control of borders . 
  it just seems like a really obvious problem with this arrangement that we have illegal immigrants coming into the uk from ireland unchecked even if we all agree that on paper it 's a good thing to have a common travel are with roi . 
  m&s abroad is completely freaking mental to me but yeah they were not very good in france when i was in one . 
  in the uk they 're marketed to the premium market although personally i 'd argue that waitrose/john lewis has the highest end produce ( and accompanying price tag ), 
  that 's definitely something i 've gotten used to in germany an actual nutritious meal for lunch . 
  v true . 
  arguably i 'd say as you can get something pretty nice for 5 $ or so whereas in the uk only thing you 're getting for 5 quid is mcdonalds or something similar and trashy . 
  so yeah people eat sandwiches and get the boots meal deal for 4 quid or so . 
   it is true you can find indian/mexican/chineese food but that 's not really something you can eat daily . 
  : o  missing the most : real sausages , soups ( not many places do it ) and mainly the idea of food variety . 
  i 'd have a look in waitrose or m&s you can definitely pretty good sausages in the uk , just not the 2 pound ones from tesco that are made from mystery ` definitely not ground-up pigeon ' meat . 
  definitely v close to something like a bratwurst you can get in the uk . 
  n\u00fcrnbergers are pretty much the same as chipolatas as well and people always have them with a roast chicken or a fry-up . 
  admitted you got to pay more for the same pork quality you get in germany but it 's definitely there . 
   the uk wants passport free travel with ireland . 
  this is not the same as freedom of movement with the eu . 
  agreed absolutely but my issue is what the government is going to do when the daily mail starts banging on about `` immigrants sneaking into britain unchecked through ireland ! '' . 
  `` open borders ! '', 
  etc etc , and as our current arrangement makes v clear they are prioritising immigration and `` controlling the border '' as one of their top goals which kind of seems to clash with opening a border with ireland . 
  cool article anyway on a first scan , i 'm a bit dubious on a lot of the stuff in it as it requires everyone else to simply agree to what we want without any self-interest on their part but it 's not mental but will read around . 
   there is so much more food variation . ? 
  really ? 
  interesting as said i was used in the uk to being able to buy mexican/indian/asian whatever types of food both ready made food and ingredients even from the smallest tesco express . 
  something fairly simple like `` chipotle '' or curry paste etc i have to go digging around in specialist shops for in germany . 
  i kind of like it a ) as i buy more from local shops b ) it forced me to learn to cook a lot of things myself . 
  one of the reasons why the british tend to be pretty lardy a lot of the time is that ready made food in the uk/microwave food is a lot `` better '' / not awful like the carbonara in lidl . 
  also the other thing german supermarkets have very little of is lamb i have to go to turkish butchers to get lamb ( and turkish stuff is probably the main thing germany has that the uk is a bit more of a struggle to get ) . 
  what do you have in germany that you ca n't get in the uk so much of interest ? 
  we have freedom of movement with eu countries at the moment though is the difference . 
  if we do n't want freedom of movement into the uk and the eu does n't want goods coming from the uk into the eu un checked it seems kind of impossible to check people are british/irish citizens entitled to travel passport free without some sort of check that they are british or irish citizens and not evil johhny foreigner surely ? 
  how can passport free travel work when not everyone coming over a border is entitled to cross the border ? 
  in terms of quality of meat + raw ingredients that one buys in the supermarkets yes in my opinion . 
  if i go to the highest quality shop in the uk ( waitrose or marks and spencers ) the quality there is far far higher in ( for example ) a normal chicken breast or a piece of beef etc than a similar `` highest quality '' shop like rewe or karstadt where i live in berlin . 
  also there 's a lot more variety of cuts generally in the uk even at your standard tesco ( which i 'd sort of mark as equivalent to edeka in germany ) personal theory i think the germans ( or perhaps berliners ) are a lot more price-conscious so having high quality options probably does n't yield much more money ,, 
  i 'm sure the dup and the looney british nationalists will be thrilled . 
  this is quite an amusing scenario to think about if i 'm honest . 
  so you think people are going to be happy with passport free travel between an eu country and the uk ? 
  is n't that even more liberalised than the current arrangement where we are n't in schengen ? 
  and is the eu going to agree to this common travel area where anything can go from the uk into the eu check free as well ? 
  lol . 
  political lackey , [ guy who does n't understand what trading bloc means ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cnay5pnwyaa7s4g.jpg:large ) , lackey replacement for shot messenger , ex head of culture . 
  i feel very optimistic about this , this can only go well . 
  in fairness i notice it too coming from uk living in germany , normal supermarket food ( meat in particular ) is both lower quality and far more reduced in variety even if i go to the most upmarket shops . 
  really would n't surprise me if that 's an outcome of customers paying more meaning wholesalers pay more and it all trickles upwards in terms of where produce gets sent so it can make the most money,
