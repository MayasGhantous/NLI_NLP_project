  the conservatives arent the main voice of britain either that didnt exactly stop them . 
  it 's in the snps mandate that they 'll hold a referendum if circumstances change materially . 
  go yell at the scottish if you think that `` oh no we 're actually in completely the opposite state that we were last time of economic stability and eu membership '' does n't constitute a change . 
  brexiters created this and now they seem to expect everyone else to bail them out as a favour after they and the tories did n't follow through on all the lovely talk of partnership after their referendum before . 
  the tories never wanted a referendum in the first place they only did it for political reasons to try and head off ukip and got their fingers burnt . 
  the snp are just taking advantage of it but the conservatives are kind of boned if they 're going to try and act like it 's irresponsible now . 
   but it was n't the defining factor . 
  it made up the uncertainty area that people voted for remain . 
  imagine the better together campaign with the legs of economic stability and eu membership kicked out from underneath it and rather than speeches about how great partners we 'll be say `` well we 're going to tell you to fuck off the moment anything important comes up '' . 
  that 's why people are pissed off about this ,, 
   most brits do n't want a referendum as polls have shown . 
  i do n't see why a minority of nationalists should continue to be allowed to threaten the european citizenship of millions of people because of xenophobia only tories and obsessives wanted this referendum in the first place . 
  the tories got the ball rolling on stupid referendums for politics and now they 're expecting everyone else to stop lol ? 
   the exact meaning of which wo n't even be fully known for 2 years . 
  hence why they 're not happy about it . 
  the scottish are n't there to just agree with everything we do which everyone seems to not be getting . 
  the stupid referendums horse has bolted already unfortunately . 
   350 million more anti-abortion death panels to the nhs every year , because brussels will take your guns away !, 
  and mexico will pay for the nhs, 
  and yet germany for example has one of the lowest unemployment rates and the best standards for workers rights going and as does france have decent measures and a better safety net for when people are not in work . 
  if it was all about being cheap then literally everything in the world would be run from some bum-fuck village in africa . 
  but work is not a homogenous thing . 
   educating and training the local population will have little effect when companies are looking for cheaper operations in eastern europe or other nations . 
  well what do you mean `` effect '' here ? 
  you are n't going to bring back jobs for uneducated people by magic . 
  or they can move to bulgaria and romania if you really want to work making ikea cups . 
  what is actually demonstrably effective is training people to work in well paying jobs and function in a modern economy . 
  your approach of being anti-globalist ** is ** done in the world . 
  look at india and working in middle eastern economies where you have to have x owners be nationals of the country and employ x people blahdeblah and all it does is create fucking retarded businesses and create corruption . 
  i work for a company that deals with emerging markets a lot and this is the biggest problem we have working in the me and africa is being forced to deal with retards who were put there by some government quota scheme that their brother in the bureaucracy was able to hijack to give their mates a job . 
  look at the countries with the highest standards of living for normal people e.g scandinavia northern europe and look at the emphasis all of them place on education , safety nets for people who are unemployed , ** balance ** between workers rights and employers , not just letting companies run wild doing whatever they want . 
  and then look at the countries that take your approach like jordan , india , china , columbia , non-eu eastern europe etc. 
  as said this is a matter of competence and governance not virtue signalling about muslims and bringing back jobs that are n't required anymore and/or pay fuck all as all the post-fact movements have claimed they 're going to do . 
  because there 's measures that can be taken against the downsides of globalism like large investments in education , training and basic incomes that the same people who vote for these parties also constantly vote down . 
  it 's like the people who voted for reagan in the 80s then when their factories shut down because of his policies then voted for trump to blame everyone else and take a dump on them . 
  hell it almost looks like a standard play now , come out with an anti-immigration agenda , cover it in `` oh we 'll bring back jobs , save healthcare etc - then the moment you win dump all the `` oh yeah totally progressive '' sounding stuff and proceed with making your mates rich like trump and brexit have done for their backers in big business and the media . 
   ofc not , they ( wilders ) do n't have any actual solutions . 
  it 's all big words and bluff and puffing up , but it 's all hot air . 
  what ? 
  no never brexit is great just you watch the detail they 've thought everything through in . 
  [ new state you say ... ] ( https://img.ifcdn.com/images/640d3f373d1ea76bab171d7dabc38434c9ed599916c109c650bd0879243694c5_1.jpg ), 
  yep that 's the same . 
  one would think they 'd learn about this by now in systems with more coalitions . 
  i 'm 28 and possibly i 'm a little skewed as i live in germany but i 'll always identify as british by instinct unless i 'm either pressed further on `` where in britain '' or if i 'm talking to someone else british . 
  not sure why if i 'm honest i guess subconciously british brings up the queen , london , our culture etc while english makes me think of lads on tour and football hooligans . 
  possibly a product of `` de-englishisation '' but i do n't see any particular positive of identifying as english over british unless i 'm talking about something like shakespeare or tolkien or football etc. 
  if i 'm honest i remember there are surveys knocking around a lot of the time but i 'm kind of curious for some credible studies on this . 
  in particular it 's very noticeable as my mum and dad both identify unfailingly as english and both are from working class backgrounds that ended up in middle class professions . 
  pretty much yes . 
  as said the fustrating part for me as someone english is that if may came out tomoz and said `` we 're actually going to do this in the interests of everyone '' then this issue would mostly dissapear . 
   the scottish were trying to break up the uk i know you 're not british but this instant attitude of the scottish ca n't possibly have any legitimate concerns they just hate the uk is part of what 's driving this . 
  there 's a massive bubble in english media where no-one has a feckin clue why the other side acts the way they are acting . 
  and the government plays up to this bubble . 
  and this is what 's leading to disaster with the eu and may well lead to the entirely avoidable , self-inflicted break-up of the uk . 
  anyway to your point as were cornish independence campaigners but no-one really gave a shit about them either . 
  the movement was never a massive risk until hard brexiters opened this can of worms with brexit and `` lol fuck scotland '' as a response to the fact that scotland will be absolutely fucked by being outside of the single market . 
  there was loads of small things as well like the labcon treatment of scotland as a vote farm/shit on the bottom of the shoe until the indyref then they made a shitload of promises to get them to stay ( including not leaving the eu ) and then went back on all of them . 
  the snp were campaigning for years but their messages is reasonating because of the actions of the westminster bubble . 
  tl : dr westminster is creating this open goal for the snp , the snp are just capitalising on it ( just like labour have n't capitalised on the incompetence of the execution of brexit ) . 
  they 're not even going to be happy anyway any economic shock is going to be due to `` not brexiting hard enough '' and even if we moved the country to fekin mars then it would be `` the eu was vindictive not giving us a special trade deal it 's all their fault for betraying us '' . 
  in england specifically ? 
  it 's certainly unusual for me to know people who identify as `` english '' apart from old people and a couple of people i know from my home village who are the crazy football hooligans/edl types and bang on about it on facebook . 
  you got any sources ? 
  seems interesting nonetheless . 
  i certainly identify as british as someone under 30 . 
  why not ? 
  if you live in a place and pay taxes and make the society what it is then why are you not worth the same as someone else ? 
  jesus boris 's turkey bollocks is still working on people months after it 's been completely debunked . 
  brexit could 've been fine with a soft-brexit . 
  this full retard natioanlist hard brexit preceeded by `` fuck u guyz , we 're gon na screw you and get special deals '' type chauvinism is what 's screwing everything and they 're the same people screaming at the scottish for daring to besmirch the `` everythings great '' party line . 
  no-one knows . 
  generally it 's `` if the eu wants it to it will '' and that qeustion is `` will the eu ( and participating states ) want it to ? '', 
  `` brexit '' as a general concept is n't why . 
  it 's because of the full `` immigants over everything '' brexit that leads to the uk leaving the single market and scotland getting absolutely fucked that sturgeon thinks she can win . 
  this is folded into general historical grievances plus the fact that millions of promises were made about being equal partners after the last referendum in 2014 that were n't carried out . 
  this has been building for a long time and being told `` fuck you '' to any compromise on brexit is just the iceing on the cake . 
  but this can be seen as only half intertwined with brexit there 's a lot of other stuff going on . 
  do n't mistake it for me being happy about it at all . 
  but i can understand where it 's coming from and scottish friends of mine understand that it 's not `` the english '' it 's angry daily mail england who 's shouting at them who 's got so much self-esteem sewn up in this brexit lark that they 're not tolerating any words or actions that go against the party line of `` everyone loves hard brexit and it 's a super smart idea '', 
   i would move myself and my business to the us if we had a soft brexit . 
  sure you would mate . 
  you just walk into the us with your `` business '' which totally exists and pick up a passport at the immigration desk . 
  purely for amusements sake , why would you move your `` business '' to the us if we 'd had a non-retarded brexit ? 
   not that i can say i 'm sad to lose all these socialists . 
  they 'll get to finally see the real benefits of freedom of movement  sure thing mate , anyone left of the conservative party is socialist . 
  back to r/conspiracy with you and your smilies . 
  well that obviously completely destroys my point , if only i 'd known where you live in the country you acting like an arrogant prat would n't matter \\ s. 
  i laughed . 
  and everything was great forevermore . 
  the end . 
   this is also assuming ruk will simply roll over and do nothing to keep herself competitive our strategy is become a tax haven . 
  we 're not getting this special deal that will enable us to be properly competitive in the way we are at the moment . 
  at best london will still be a large financial center and can retain it 's expertise but having the rest of the uk as a drain will catch up eventually on this tax haven plan unless we kill all the poor . 
   you just said this is n't a game but are also treating single market membership like a magic `` get all the investment '' button no that 's precisely the opposite of what i 'm saying . 
  the simple version of it is they 're not sabotaging themselves to appease immigration obsessives , that benefits them on a lot of different levels . 
   but at least you 've accepted scotland will need to compete , but now you need to approach the question of how it will compete with her most similar country , ireland , when ireland has a more stable economy , has an established currency and low corporation tax , is scotland going to lower it 's corporation tax to ireland levels ? 
  ask nicola sturgeon , i 'm not a scottish nationalist ( for starters i 'm english ) i 'm just saying why they 're pissed off and why this is being driven by hard brexiters and sturgeon is just riding the wave . 
  the other problem here is that you ca n't exactly send a brexiter up to scotland and have them make arguments about the economic irrationality of this . 
  much much less than brexit is going to cost us . 
  you can get angry and deride them all you want but that is n't going to change the facts on the ground on how the tories sold out the scottish ( and northern irish and everyone else in the country who did n't vote brexit ) to appease hard brexiters with a no compromise full-retard brexit .
