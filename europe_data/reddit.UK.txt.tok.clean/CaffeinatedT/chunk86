  this is exactly the type of bollocks talked about . 
  there is absolutely 0 need to elect anti-democratic bollocks spouters to deal with issues that can be dealt with by enforcing laws properly and co-operating on border security and processing of refugees . 
  there is absolutely 0 need to hand over your country to small govt loonies masquerading as `` the people '' by banging on about immigration , mixing up seperate issues , making stuff up and `` taking care of the poor '' when the overwhelming evidence is they do n't give a fuck and that the real solutions lie in dealing with massive inequality at the country level not blaming vague `` globalists '' for everything . 
   good luck with calling everybody a racist because the poor dont want more refugees , you know how supposedly everytime anyone talked about immigration then they were called `` racist '' by everyone ? 
  well apparently the new thing is pointing out that post-fact politics is full of bollocks you supposedly hate the poor or shout racist at everyone or something . 
  this `` tactic '' is bollocks try and defend post-fact politics rather than claiming someone hates the poor or `` the people '' or whatever you want to call it . 
  all you have to do is see what both brexit and trump have done after winning . 
  after couching everything in fluffy language about `` speaking up for the people '' and promising loads of good sounding stuff for everyone even when when contradictory they both got into power and have spent the whole time shouting down anyone disagreeing or pointing out reality . 
  as well as completely fucking everything up for themselves and acting only in the interests of their wealthy backers . 
  the mentality of post-fact supporters is fundamentally undemocratic branding everyone else as `` enemies of the people '' surely by now people are realising post-facters ca n't be trusted . 
  i do n't think it was good or bad , but there 's a very strong movement of political correctness from people like michael gove where they 're actively against teaching anything but a propaganda picture of the british empire . 
  it 's just like anti-evolution activists in the us who claim `` kids should have the full picture '' but then get angry when the full picture is properly taught . 
  even as it was the empire when i was at school about 10 years ago was covered only tangenitally when we studied gandhi and we saw the amritsar massacre . 
  if i 'd never studied anything afterwards then `` the empire '' is just some very vague thing where it seems like we just woke up one day with half the world under our control and then kindly gave it back as all a big misunderstanding . 
  surely the one thing we 've learnt from brexit and trump is they are n't anti-establishment they just want to ** be ** the establishment and then will chuck off all the bullshit they spouted in the campaigns . 
  then once theyve won they get rid of any of the promises made and spend the whole time shouting down anyone who disagrees . 
   not everyone is impressed by the pilot scheme , however . 
  in february , finland 's biggest union said the experiment was unaffordable and would encourage some people to work less while driving up wages in undesirable professions . 
  is that not a benefit ? 
  my biggest bit of scepticisism with this whole thing is there would have to be a pretty solidly established constitutional control and procedure on where pay rates are set to stop either too much or too little being paid for political points . 
  tl : dr ` yes but read this sprawling text ** this time ** the out of context and inflated stats are different and we should be holding racial groups collectively responsible because the right wing tells us to ' i didnt read a word of this out of context drivel . 
  you already showed yourself as delusional and irrational when it comes to brown people why would i care to read that drivel in sprawling long form ? 
  ive already hear the same shite about eastern europeans from people like you five years ago . 
   no , we 're not saying anything . 
  statistics are showing . 
  as said my grandparents would 've said the same and whipped out a daily mail article showing an out-of-context statistic on how romanians are 8 times more likely to be convicted of violent crime than brits or similar . 
  but go on then i 'm sure ** this ** time it will be different lets see your statistics . 
  i expect for the millionth time it will be one of * out of context statistics * right-wing blogs * easily debunked * an article freaking out about one single incident extrapolated to absurdity * all of the above and apparently going off of this i 'm then supposed to start holding people collectively responsible for the actions of others in their arbitrary group ? 
  cool story alter . 
  well i mean i never said it directly in those words ... 
  watch those goalposts move . 
  why not ? 
  name an unusually left wing policy that actually exists outside the heads of the alt right ? 
  reactionary views general anger at anyone who doesnt like trump using a million sock puppet accounts . 
  just how many are there ? 
  i see youre ` australian ' now as well . 
  was going to say pretty much nothing gets said in the article outside of ` we 're going to have to review things ' and ` it 's a bit like diplomatic relations with the gdr at the moment ' . 
  [ i 'm a true englishman what can i say ] ( https://youtu.be/akfbshw9uga?t=35s ), 
   importing huge numbers of ` enemies ' blur blur blur blur blur blur . 
  oh no ... it 's retarded ... :(, 
   you 're painfully unfunny . 
  consider suicide followed by account deletion . 
  oh no the two day old trump-tard account is n't amused . 
  i was dating a slovakian girl once . 
  they definitely exist . 
  they 're up to something . 
   you may find his screeching amusing , but to me it 's just annoying . 
  ` zer shall be no merriment or nazi jokes in zeez replies zat does not amuse ich personally , by order of za humour fuhrer , ein volk , ein reich , ein witz ', 
  make a point or pipe down . 
   which personally puts me off from doing anything . 
  that 's the intention of the tactic of saying that an anti-corruption protest is an opposition protest . 
  create chaos and denials and counter-denials even where it 's completely false and people do n't want to act because everything becomes morally grey . 
  see also refugees and ` if you are n't anti-muslim you must want open borders ' . 
  the only people who can protest on this type of issue is a small number of extremists who do n't give a shit about the complexities . 
  making a joke about hitler with his leg blown off is hysterical ? 
  i have a feeling it 's more you just want to jump in and scream ` godwin ' and ` hysterical ! ', 
  at everyone . 
  the projection seems pretty heavy if i 'm honest for someone who 's trying to act like they 're somehow neutral but who does n't actually want to engage with the point made . 
  unless by hysterical you just meant you appreciate the joke . 
  anyway back to you . 
   insanely leftist stuff , go on ... 
   stop being so hysterical , i 'm not , i 'm taking the piss out of numpties . 
   insanely leftist stuff , what was actually done that 's leftist in specific not just ` le open borders ' because that is simply wrong . 
  lets make this fact based . 
  hey lets not get all factsy here let 's just accept that flairless accounts spouting ` le open border policy ' and trump-tards all know much more about every single country in europes politics in depth than anyone with any actual connection to the country . 
  trust me it 's not like anyone who actually speaks german or anything would know more about germany than some angry keyboard warrior tapping away . 
  the people in r/de are all just wrong maaan . 
  everybody knows that reality is most definitely determined by who can dogpile the most replies spouting post-fact anti-refugee talking points . 
  [ first line of identitarians wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/identitarian_movement )  not to be confused with identity politics . 
  lol ... well quite . 
  as far as i see here there 's nothing about cutting the uk out of defense deals this is airbus reacting to brexit in pretty much the exact way it was warned they would react with their british operations . 
  it 's classic tactic same with every other post-fact movement happening at the moment from brexit to trump to erdogan to orban . 
  anyone protesting against incompetence and general shittiness must automatically be with ` the opposition ' / a sore loser etc. 
  it 's classic de-legitimisation and normalises incompetence rather than taking the hard route and winning arguments and governing competently . 
  ` no no no you do n't get it , everyone who is n't advocating for creating religious pre-crime of being a muslim is now left-wing ', 
  sure thing . 
  if we take ` the left ' as ` everyone leaning more to the left than hitler with his right leg blown off . ', 
   merkel  left choose one and/or stop spouting the usual post-fact bollocks . 
  apologies i 100 % mean the governments not the people , even the people who vote for it are just gullible not bad . 
  cherry picking because it 's a conclusion arrived at before evidence . 
  it 's something i find quite funny . 
  before the refugee crisis in the uk it was romanians and bulgarians coming to the uk raping and committing crime with everything bad anyone did blown up in the daily mail and the right wing forums i used to follow would be all the same rhetoric you see now about refugees . 
  before them it was polish people and my grandpa spoke about polish people the exact way you see people banging on about every single thing anyone from the target immigrant group does now . 
  he 's pointing out the stupidity of declaring pre-crimes based on nationality . 
  right wingers in real life who get elected and make policy . 
  ` dey all da same !, 
  so dats ok ', 
  you 're trying to equivocate the authoritarian behaviour of hungary and polands governments with the rest of the eu not accepting authoritarianism . 
  it 's classic post-fact delusions . 
  pointing it out does n't make anyone a troll just because you get offended by it . 
  yes call everyone else a troll for calling authoritarian delusionists what they are . 
  a rift implies equality . 
  shit tier countries living on handouts from the rich countries and enjoying all the benefits of their citizens being able to immigrate there while virtue signalling about immigration and being anti-eu to their citizens to cover up for their domestic governments incompetence . 
  yeah well ... nazisfourthreichtwoworldwars , lol eat that sick burn fritz . 
  oof and i thought brexiters and putin-bots could n't take a joke . 
  net contribution , france got a hell of a lot more in cap . 
  although i 'm not sure if this chart accounts for rebates or not . 
   as for down-sides , considering how huge of consumer market uk is , for many of flagship german and french corporations , this nodeal approach from eu 's side will mellow out heavily , once directors of those corporations start getting concerned about their bonuses as brexit draws closer . 
  i 'm sorry but this is ` the german cars will save us ' approach and its been debunked by reality if you look at german politics . 
   you might drop , but largely due to emerging economies with much bigger population .
