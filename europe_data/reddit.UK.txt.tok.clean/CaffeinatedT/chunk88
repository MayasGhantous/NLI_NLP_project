  and if the dirty foreigners take it from us by banning baked beans in the eu there will be hell to pay . 
  seems interesting anyway although it feels a bit like a joke that i dont get the premise of ( if you forgive my ignorance ), 
  afaik heinz is an american company founded by a german immigrant . 
  i 'm just sort of taking the piss out of our tendency to claim everything is british . 
  try being greek in any conversation about financial prudence . 
  i 'm going with u/heknarf . 
  it 's completely mental to bother making something like baked beans . 
  as someone who loves to cook the ` return on investment ' in terms of improving the taste is so low it 's simply pointless . 
  save the time/pots used . 
  nothing more british than a name like heinz how dare you sir, 
  love this . 
  i always imagined brexiters in denial at the moment as the black knight . 
  brexitosis . 
  its a real disease at the moment where people are desperately trying to justify a dumb decision they might have believed in for 10-20 years . 
  look forward to when vodafone can drone strike your house if your monthly payment fucks up taking bank payment or something . 
  they answer to the glorious free market dear citizen do not fear if you are dissatisfied with the service when they kill you too much you can always hire your own better army to defend you . 
  i have 3 friends with a von in their name who would disagree with you . 
  the habsburgs will rise again, 
  she 's german it still counts . 
  who 's against it ? 
  we have the best queen , everyone tells us we have the best queen . 
  i work for a living sunshine . 
  not that this is the first time breitards get something wrong through dumb assumptions . 
  not worth the effort . 
  it 's obvious you 've just gone off into whatabout territory it does n't need pointing out anyone can see you 're just another breittard, 
  what a prat . 
  cant spell breitbart without err ... bright ... ahem . 
  ` they hate our western values , therefore we need to remove all of our western values ', 
  and here comes the trademark post-fact ` whatabout x ' pivot . 
  you lost , have a nice day . 
  facts are meaningless without context or evidence or analysis . 
  bulgarians and romanians commit a lot of crime in the uk . 
  do we then hold everyone from these two countries to all be inherently inferior and violent with no further questioning or analysis needed ? 
  so wait there 's more crime in refugee camps ? 
  therefore we need to kick them all out ? 
  what 's your point here ? 
  apparently it 's you who do n't share our values as you do n't believe in the rule of law . 
  we do not punish people for crimes other people commit based on a shared ethnicity . 
  that 's a proper hard brexit . 
  your prejudice is getting in the way of actually thinking about this logically . 
  my parents claimed the exact same things about eastern europeans when they were integrated into the eu because of right wing media blowing up everything they did . 
  you clearly understand the flaws in your logic as you point them out when i use your prejudiced logic against bulgarians but for some ** strange ** reason you do n't want to use those same faculties of critical thinking when it 's someone who is n't like you . 
  i 'd get reading some rawls if i were [ you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veil_of_ignorance ), 
  so sweeping assumptions about mena nationals are fine based on the actions of their shittiest people but you do n't like it when i take your mindset and make assumptions on bulgarians based on the sick actions of other bulgarian nationals in germany or the fact that i grew up with my parents talking about bulgarians and romanians the way you now talk about everyone of mena descent . 
  that incident with bulgarians actually happened in the same neighbourhood where i live in berlin actually . 
  by your logic i should hate bulgarians way more than i hate muslims . 
  they were ** bulgarian nationals **  these guys were gypsies oh so ** now ** you demand the context with the evidence behind my sweeping statements of high crime amongst bulgarians ? 
  seems a bit inconsistent surely ? 
  surely it 's not because you do n't like it when it 's done to you but you 're fine with doing it to others ? 
  there 's an interesting bit in the article where they talk about the prio being long term training and fully integrating people rather than sticking people breaking rocks and then being shocked they never learn the language and dont integrate long term as was the problem with the gast-arbeiter programme for a lot of people . 
  as are bulgarians and romanians in the uk and [ here in germany ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/177927/all+suspects+in+attack+on+woman+in+berlin+metro+are+bulgarian ) . 
  shockingly there 's wider context to it rather than racial inferiority . 
  i assume you do n't accept sweeping racial stereotypes against bulgarians by the right wing media and brexiters ? 
  everyone has a potential tendency of crime and violence if i put enough scare quotes around it . 
  your prejudice comes first and then you 're finding reasons to justify it hence the fact you declare them as x based on 0 evidence than other internet loonies who 've also worked themselves into a frenzy where they just declare uncritically that they 're an evil hivemind . 
  i just said it 's an issue with the system who has ever claimed it 's perfect ? 
  apparently any flaw in the system , even when enforcement is being worked on as a policy priority means that no-one should ever do anything . 
  but any flaw in the argument of ` le muslim illegal refugee hivemind ' should n't be addressed or criticised because it triggers post-facters . 
   ** application ** system you understand what this means right ? 
  just saying ` ur not brown enough you cant be from syria ' or whatever is n't really a great way to run a system . 
  because they 're refugees not workers . 
  they do n't speak the language and the bureaucracy creates massive issues . 
  if you read the article and tried to understand the complexities you 'd stop sounding like such a prat . 
  that 's a seperate enforcement issue and one that i discuss in r/de enough . 
  problem is opening up the convo to people who just freak out and mindlessly conflate all brown people as ` le refugees ' and spout uninformed twaddle . 
  i live in germany . 
  what are they doing ? 
  what ? 
  so when the right wing was screaming about bulgarians and romanians coming to the uk to rape women commit crime and take welfare that was absolutely true ? 
  which is why you have an application system to deal with who qualifies for refugee status and who does n't . 
  if you do n't even understand what you 're talking about it 's probably smart not to go in for strong sweeping opinions . 
   they are are illegal immigrants who not illegal , there is a war . 
   come to feed of your work for free . 
  bollocks as said you 've been drinking the kool-aid too much . 
  i 'm all for contextual discussion on the loopholes for pisstakers and enforcement but i 'm just laughing at someone with a bulgarian flair spouting the same bollocks that everyone was spouting about bulgarians and romanians all being lazy welfare scroungers a few years ago . 
  honestly every time i hear this bollocks being recycled uncritically as gospel and get breitbart articles cited as evidence with 0 context i think it makes me even more willing to pay for refugees in taxes purely because of how much it annoys the post-fact right on its own . 
   ms \u00d6zo\u011fuz said the authorities ' main priority was not to find employment for the refugees as soon as possible but to ensure they learnt german and had access to training to acquire the skills needed for an advanced industrial economy . 
  `` in the past , we put people very quickly into jobs where they did n't need to speak , and 40 years later people asked them -- how come you still ca n't speak german ? '' she said . 
  `` we do n't want to repeat that mistake . '' she said authorities had speeded up asylum procedures , so migrants did not have to wait `` years or even decades '' for a decision on their status , and were getting better at recognising foreign professional qualifications so it was easier for refugees to seek employment in germany . 
  as a german taxpayer i 'm happy enough with that . 
  as said long as they do n't half-arse it to please perpetually outraged people with stupid signals that please the right-wing then i 'm fine . 
  they 're not meant to contribute they 're refugees . 
  if people are n't taking the piss out of the system e.g being able to evade deportation when applications fail etc ( which imo is the big area that needs reforming ) then i 'm cool with it . 
   has the so called `` soft brexit '' ever been a viable alternative outside of the uk ? 
  soft brexit has pretty much 0 opposition from anyone major if the uk accepts freedom of movement . 
  that 's the bed-rock of the whole ` cherry picking ' thing that everyone is on about . 
  the uk has to accept the four freedoms to be in the single market . 
  from there there 's scope to talk about efta/eea etc type agreements the problem is the impasse that the hard right of the uk who form the ideological core of brexit is obsessed about eu freedom of movement while the eu countries are n't going to allow any undermining of the core freedoms of the market . 
   the eu has been pretty firm on a complete exit before any renegotiation of anythin . 
  that 's a seperate issue on the conduct of the negotiations . 
  why do you think the government is expected to [ announce spaceports in the up coming queens speech ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/space-flights-travel-queens-speech-theresa-may-brexit-driverless-cars-spaceships-ports-a7798001.html ) ? 
  hard brexit does n't go far enough we 're going to brexit the planet and bring back the empire in space free of the yoke of the ** unelected totalitarian ** earth bound ** eussr dictatorship ** . 
  i call it # ( ( ( space brexit : the final frontier ) ) ) [ * music plays * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpj6anurfuw ), 
  it is n't just a matter of insulation on its own homes + towerblocks etc are designed differently to be able to vent heat out at night for example with higher windows , shutters and less roof insulation for example . 
  increasingly homes are designed better for hot weather in the uk but the assumption simply was n't there in the 60s etc. 
   ultimately , i think brexit is bad , but i 'd rather it go badly because brexit is bad , they were never going to be happy though there 's four outcomes here . 
  there is an ok outcome ( soft brexit ) but people are always going to be pissed off and betrayed feeling on the right . 
  - soft brexit , pissed off hard brexiters and far right , back to square one with the daily mail blaming eu for everything - hard brexit - inevitable economic damage , severity depends on amount of compromise made with eu , eu blamed for being vindictive , conservatives blamed for compromising or not brexiting hard enough/screwing up negotiations - full retard no deal brexit : angry brexiters blame eu for not compromising enough , proceed to get angry when uk gets back in eu , back to square one . 
  - amazing legendary hard brexit with all the benefits and no payments - eu countries all agree to shoot themselves in their own faces to do brexiters a favour . 
  eurosceptic movements flourish , single market collapses , economic devastation , post-facters angry at something else ( being absorbed into america and becoming airstrip one lol ? ),
