  plenty of people wanted single market without any money being paid for it , it was delusional and they were warned . 
  brexit means brexit do n't shy away from it now , you won , get over it . 
   you 're clearly still salty about the result . 
  talk to me when your tears have dried . 
  wow what an unpredictable response having run out of arguments . 
  no salt here , working in germany myself i wish you all the best for living under torynet and the brexit funders small government tax-haven fantasy , you voted for it you deserve all of it , 
   so , you 're saying the uk was holding the eu to a standstill in regards to an eu army ? 
  despite them making plans to develop one before we voted to leave ? 
  yes . 
  we had an overwhelming veto in the first place , and if we 'd voted to remain it would 've required a new referendum . 
  a ) was n't happening b ) was n't necessary anyway as the uk and france would be the large military backbone of the eu and two security council seats . 
  now the situation is different so they are reacting to it . 
  brexiters wanted this to happen . 
   `` anti-rational '' ? 
  that 's a matter of opinion . 
  why ? 
  all of these movements either require not thinking things through or encouraging others not to think things through and demonising anyone who does . 
  it 's just a simple statement of the motivations of the movements against enlightenment thought like rule of law , human rights , economic liberalism etc. 
  they were n't going to without a massive treaty re-write on how voting works because we were blocking it . 
  now we 're leaving it 's their look-out if that 's what they want to do in response to anti-rational movements in the us , uk , turkey , russia etc. 
  brexit means brexit and all that this is what brexit means and this what brexiters voted for and were warned about . 
  what do you mean by ftt sorry ? 
  edit ( financial transaction tax i guess ? ), 
  why not ? 
  people can tax things , we do n't say we 're a socialist country because we tax petrol ? 
  do you ever worry at all that perhaps when plenty of other countries like germany and sweden tax at much higher levels and still have innovative succesful businesses that maybe there 's a problem with the uk behind the incredibly low productivity like zombie company mentality of just hoping for government hand outs in tax-cuts and not innovating and growing ? 
  after all when workers wages dont grow in line with inflation we say that they 're underskilled or should move to a better paid field , but everyone has a freak out if we say the same thing about inefficient companies rather than the company failing and capital going to someone more efficient and productive . 
  hence why the uk is so unproductive against its gdp . 
  i 'd agree that corporation tax is generally not my favourite thing in the world but the uk will still have one of the lowest rates in the g7 even under corbyn . 
   taxing the skilled workers we need at a higher rate than ever before would hurt our uk operations significantly . 
  i work in germany and pay a pretty damn high level of tax . 
  when living standards are higher in a country and people are able to have stability in living situations ( for one example ) then having to pay massive wages becomes less necessary . 
  you 'd have to almost double my salary to get me back to london for example . 
  the economist is pretty much the same as the guardian in terms of being liberal as well . 
  most of the editorial line is let businesses get on with their shit , but some fair taxation is needed for infrastructure , do n't be silly on drugs or gay marriage justlet people do their own shit etc. 
  sometimes they disagree how much fiscal/monetary stimulation is needed e.g the economist endorsed cameron while the guardian endorsed the lib dems in 2010 but editorially they were both flavours of liberalism . 
  even now the guardians [ endorsement of corbyn ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2017/jun/02/the-guardian-view-on-our-vote-its-labour ) mainly hinges on  the campaign itself has been unexpectedly strategic , based on a manifesto adroitly pitched both at energising labour 's base and the under-35s , who have responded with rare enthusiasm . 
  that manifesto quickened political pulses . 
  ** it 's not perfect -- it over-emphasises the state ** and fails to tackle tory benefit cuts -- but it is a genuine attempt to address a failing social and economic model . 
  in many ways , it is a painful reminder of how much of our collective sense of social justice and community spirit has been lost since 2010 . 
  ** labour has set the terms of the political debate : most notably with a keynesian response of increasing public investment , and increasing public spending financed by higher taxes , to stimulate the economy so that the country ends up wealthier than anything proposed under tory plans ** . 
  they basically feel that corbyns stimulation is better for the economy than more austerity rather than endorsing him because they believe in socialism and the plight of the working class or whatever . 
  they 're still tutting about too much statism . 
  the economist again slightly to the right went for the lib-dems this time but they 're both against moralist conservative statism of the type may preaches . 
  that 's pretty much already what brexiters tried to claim despite 0 evidence of it and conscription dying out as a normal practice in most european armies . 
  you forget that scandis will never miss an opportunity to gloat about how much more environmentally friendly their death star is so it does n't have air-conditioning thus no shaft . 
  not exactly surprising . 
  the guardian goes for a liberal point of view . 
  if you prioritised the economy and free market over other issues then there 's nothing about the guardian that would disagree with you . 
  the guardian is not a socialist paper ( editorially ) or anything like that hence their lukewarm support for corbyn the whole time . 
   obviously you ca n't just ask the entire country and sum up the results . 
  well actually that is pretty much what they used to do until things started really fracturing and going crazy due to parties realising they could just fuck off safe seats and target marginals . 
  the assumption was normally that if a constituency was 45 % labour and there was a 5 % labour swing then it would now by 50 % labour . 
  that 's how simplified the models were unless collated at constituency level . 
  nowadays the answer to your question is ` hugely complicatedly ' to put it in short . 
  but in short to try and explain without using the word ` multi-variate regression ' most of the more complex models rely on constructing a base model based on a national sample of various different demographics and then adjusting the constituency projections based on behaviour in previous elections ( e.g constituencies with defence employers nearby tend to vote more tory based on the same inputs of national vote popularity ) . 
  so to simplify off of a 0.50 national vote share you might expect a constituency with a defense establishment to have 1 1.025 multiplier in favour of tories over a ` normal ' constituency . 
  aka if 50 % votes nationally go tory this place will vote 50.03 % conservative . 
  these models get built up over loads of different multipliers ( e.g demographically younger constituency will likely vote less tory given the same national sampling input ) and you end up at rough national conclusions . 
  different polling companies have different models for what x % means for each sample but broadly they all use a fairly standard set of methods for gathering the data . 
  how they then take ' 53 % of people intend to vote y ' and apply it to the whole country is where the big differences are . 
  the right and the establishment is shit-scared of a proper democratic system in both the us and the uk . 
  it only takes one corbyn or sanders to slip through the net with proper reforms ( not just brexit fake reforms that entrench the establishment ) and it 's over for them forever when you ca n't just whip up a vocal active minority of low-info drones and shit all over everyone else in order to keep your tax-evasion schemes legal . 
  politics over country as always i 'm sure ** this time ** it 'll turn out well . 
  they do usually but the problem for her is she 's struggling with the accusations that it 's her arrogance and cuts of police that have caused these attacks . 
  she 's made a lot of enemies and used a lot of divisive tactics and it 's coming home to roost . 
  the fact that people have simply given up on the idea of a conciliatory and popular prime minister and are instead looking for majorities to force through policy on the rest of the country is deeply disturbing democratically in the long run . 
  because she 's taken her base for granted outside of the daily mail bubble and thanks to her record as home secretary the tories have blown their main pillars of being the security party and of being the party of business and economics . 
  not to mention that freaking out old people about dementia taxes will cost her . 
  she 's losing this corbyn is n't winning anything . 
  question is how much the tabloids can fill in the gaps for her and how motivated they can get voters . 
  i 'm very sceptical of the yougov polling everyones going off of showing that they wont win a majority as it 's an entirely new statistical model however when even the best most tory friendly polling has a small tory majority against a candidate as weak as jeremy corbyn in terms of pure visuals then theres no way this is going to go well for after the election . 
  - be rich/a corporate slave and have healthcare - die love the choice . 
  i 'd rather not have my life held hostage by my employer though . 
  i despise may but i struggle to put her on the same level as orban et al even though many of our more bootlickey voters would like it . 
  i 'd be dissapointed too that people still exist who think that what the nazis wanted to do is something to aspire to . 
  get out of the continent if you hate our values so much . 
  we have way more to fear from the authoritarian right taking away our rights and freedoms than from some random jumped up dumbass quoting allah . 
  it was a stitch up anyway of an intentionally crap solution proposed rather than just `` lets look at reforming this '' , some people wanted to kick clegg over tuition fees ( mostly ` progressives ' for many of whom this was the foreplay of the self-inflicted-buggery they administered themselves as lexiters 5 years later ) , same guys who brought us the wonderful idea of brexit brought us [ this totally legit argument ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/admin/bkfill/default_image_group/2011/2/25/1298628970292/no-to-av-baby-campaign-005.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2cleft&amp;blend64=ahr0chm6ly91cgxvywrzlmd1aw0uy28udwsvmjaxni8wni8wny9vdmvybgf5lwxvz28tmtiwmc05mf9vchqucg5n&amp;s=1f8e6404d3afef32d7a18f15b352fcc0 ) and a load of other people put parties before country because they thought politics should be treated like a game of football and that massive swathes of the country should be effectively unrepresented because they were safe seats . 
  5 years later lo and behold massive austerity and neglected areas + politicking due to fptp blows up in camerons face and then we have brexit . 
  my grandparents fought in world war two against people like that . 
  corbyn 's more wild policies can and will be voted down by the plp and the non-crazy elements though and can be modified and changed . 
  once you vote for may you 've tightened the ratchet on an authoritarian state that 's going to employ too many people to just be gotten rid of . 
  we got what we deserved when we voted down voting reform in 2010 for the bantz of giving clegg a kicking . 
  glad i fucked off middle england is not going to be capable of putting country over political parties till something disastrous happens . 
   it great that people can buy affordable groceries ? 
  it 's great for people like me absolutely . 
  on well paid work i can afford more stuff easier . 
  i can buy two pork chops instead of one for dinner or whatever because a kilogram of them costs 5-6 $ in the store around the corner from me ( in berlin ) however the cost of that stuff being so cheap is the low wages for the people who are employed in that industry and the intensive and possibly eventually unethical means with which they can still keep themselves viable . 
  i absolutely agree with a lot of the whys for farming subsidies , i just always feel very meh around any industry built on pushing down costs beyond a point where a business is sustainable for the people actually doing the work even if they do get subsidies . 
  possibly because i 'm an adult but i 'll pay more these days for reliable goods/quality/knowledge that it 's not made from dead puppies and ground up orphans etc. 
  in fairness would n't that be better that people are actually paying the costs of what they consume long run ? 
  pretty much all of the problems of the world are caused by the pressure to drive costs down so that people can have cheap shit . 
  and certainly these subsidies seem to be pretty nuanced and limited in their positives a lot of the time . 
  i think people have learnt enough of a lesson from trump of what happens though . 
  she 'd just take over and it 'd be anyone not-white on the shitty end of the stick ( it 's never ` just the bad ones ' ) and likely she 's also well aware that she will not be winning her case on merit at the end of four years so just like the republicans in america she 'd be undermining institutions and trying to disenfranchise other voters outside of her base who can be treated like shit , as long as muslims in the same class get treated worse . 
  wait is this a joke or am i missing something very counter-intuitive about france ? 
  i thought the whole reason there 's more protests in summers generally is better weather and students are on holiday and have free time to protest ? 
  but this is just hand-waving away all of the extremely clear evidence . 
  all cards are on the table on both sides like it or not and we all know the outcomes - uk reverses stays in eu - uk accepts freedom of movement and keeps existing trade conditions and citizens rights - uk/eu fta , can not be better or same as existing deal or single market collapses .
