  even then they do n't have anywhere near the same levels of integration . 
  interestingly according to that page they 're ** also ** looking to move towards a ** single market and common competition policies ** as well in the future ( basically sovereignty losses exchanged for other benefits same as the eu ) . 
  they already have an organisation called the `` pacific islands forum '' in which they 're committing to do similar things to the eu . 
  as said the way you actually achieve this free trade is through signing an agreements , and when you sign an agreement you inherently give up some sovereignty or you 're basically going off of pinkie swears , which in international relations terms never works out well . 
  you absolutely can * theoretically * yes . 
  but seeing as free trade has been in everyones interests for centuries but no-one has even set up anything significant in terms of trade * let alone ** harmonisation of standards and product standards across entire economies without some sort of deferral of sovereignty and agreement to abide by certain common rules ( e.g wto is a supranational set of rules too ) then it would certainly seem like this your theoretical is probably unlikely for the near future . 
  until this completely free trading self-organising co-operative anarchist ( not in the bad sense ) world arises the european single market + tpp and other supranational agreements are pretty much as close as you get to it . 
  absolutely you can have free trade without the eu model but you can not have as free trade as the eu single market without some compromise on sovereignty , even usual free trade agreements like tpp contain agreements not to use sovereignty and to go through arbitration rather than just saying `` lol im bigger , i win '' which is pretty much what any 100 % sovereignty system looks like . 
   that 's how police works . 
  and it was police , not military . 
  by repeatedly describing them as a `` military force '' you are trying to manipulate the narrative and create a specific image in people 's heads . 
  you know what manipulates a narrative ? 
  paramilitaries/militaries/police whatever shooting unarmed civilians with live ammunition . 
  just like russia invading crimea and ukraine after their puppet got forced from office makes them look bad . 
   i have not provided any personal interpretations or opinions in this thread yet . 
  aside from dead civilians does n't prove anything and that we need to talk about vague accusations and conjecture about the police ` just askin the questions u know ? ' . 
  your highly critical and in-depth analysis does n't seem to be interested in the rest of the story . 
  i live and work in germany . 
  can now only type on qwertz keyboard , my life is hell . 
  would be open to moving to another country if time and job was right we 'll see . 
  ` we want more sovereignty , so what we 'll do is leave the eu and then we 'll go off with a load of other countries and we 'll all agree to bind ourselves to harmonised production and regulation standards so that we can all trade with each other easily within our market , that way we 'll make an incentive for people to agree to it and not just be us benefiting . 
  obviously as part of that we 'll need some sort of neutral arbitrator to enforce any disputes we have long term so we 'll have ourselves a court somewhere and we 'll all agree to abide by the conditions of that court and so we 'll be giving up some theoretical sovereignty i guess but that 's ok . now as we have this union of european countries what shall we call it , oh well fuck it we 'll name it later , man the eu are going to be so pissed off when they find out we did this :d :d ', 
  got ta re-write that history dont we ? 
  not much to understand here a military force against a massively less armed civilian force in service of an anti-democratic government is the oppressor , trying to say `` well some threw rocks '' and bog the whole thing down in conspiracy theories and conjecture about ` dey da same ' is becoming a weaker and weaker tactic by the day . 
  i do love this narrative that because someone managed to get weapons and fought back against a large organised military trained force shooting at unarmed civilians to prop up an anti-democratic government then that means the whole thing is invalidated and the oppressor with the massive army is now the victim somehow . 
  that sure makes it look good does n't it ? 
  `` please stop being angry at the oppression by the authorities or these guys i 'm protecting will shoot you in cold blood '', 
  honestly i am disgusted at the attempts to re-write history by putin and his mouthpieces of this as some eu/us/lizard people invasion or whatever it was and i 'm happy that ukranians were able to rise up against being a russian satellite state . 
  however when i watched this documentary it almost seemed like a jerry bruckheimer film . 
  if this was a documentary about something in americas history we 'd be laughing at how ridiculous it was . 
  a lot of times these arrests are just to arrest everyone who 's also under surveillance in the area to head off copycats and/or anyone known to be in their support networks . 
  can i make a joke about all the germans tanks getting stolen the next day or is that lazy ? 
  ach was ? 
  i am so ~ ~ \u00fcberrasch ~ ~ very surprisings being . 
  the daily mail were right all along why did we not listen !, 
  wait strasbourg is n't in france ? 
   telegraph ? 
  is n't that supposed to be one of the better newspapers in uk ? 
  used to be a pretty good economically literate right leaning paper paper , not anymore they purged all their informed journalists and turned it into a tabloid with longer words for more money . 
  now it 's run by ex-daily mailers and fights the rearguard for post-facters and brexit still being a smart idea . 
  you sound like you are doubting our strength and stability comrade . 
  perhaps you should be reporting to strength and stability school for re-education . 
  how radical is this ? 
  i thought it was certainly fairly normal for british units to be under american command and/or vice-versa in our many exciting trips around the middle east ? 
  you answer the question you just spouted a load of bollocks without evidence and then demanded everyone else disprove it . 
  what black guy ? 
  i only see a shadow . 
  the same people who believe in soros conspiracies already , aka stupid people . 
  unrepresentative voting system + gerrymandering + old people . 
  kids aborted themselves rather than have her as a mother . 
  oh you are just adorable . 
   you should probably go read the news though , it is not going well for the post-facters this year at all . 
  if i 'm honest i think that 's the main bit of the whole thing . 
  a lot of people either seem to be under the impression that they 're going to be forced to suck dicks if gay marriage is allowed or they just really want to control others lives . 
  once people get over it and realise it makes not the blindest bit of difference to allow gay people to make a legal contract then the freakouts collapse pretty quickly, 
  because the deutsche bank fine initially ( never finished the story on the final amount ) far outstripped expectations for what the fine would be while the jp morgan one ( understripped ? ), 
  expectations . 
  especially taking the relative sizes of the two into account . 
  as much as one jokes , alcohol abuse ( as in specifically alcohol not just drugs etc ) is a pretty heavy correlator with suicide . 
  lot of people got hit and chucked out before that emergency suspension of the ` totez not a musim ban ' came into effect . 
  and apparently there 's still a fair bit of dodgy stuff happening where people dont have legal representation at border ( but that 's unsourced speculation ) . 
  not to mention this is only a small aspect there 's similar stuff happening with others like mexicans etc not to mention the plans for a force for hunting illegals ( although that seems to be on back burner at the moment ) . 
  there go the goal posts moving . 
  as said rather than saying `` lol never happened '' perhaps actually check facts first . 
  they did but if this is the settlement they reached over mortages [ here ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-settlement-idusbre9ai0oa20131120 ) afaik this was still a negotiated settlement rather than a punishment far less than the amount they made so i did n't include it although its a significant amount yeah . 
  another favourite of mine was 20bn fine for bp that actually hit bps sales price ( even if the fine was tax deductible according to a friend with some expertise ) . 
  but yeah the americans generally do better than the uk i think we 're pretty shameless . 
  genuinely ca n't remember a proper book-throwing unless you count being bailed out and taken into public ownership as a book throwing .

  i do n't know how many hsbc people went to jail for lying about laundering bloody money or lying about libor rates ? 
  the whole game of the post-brexit uk is going to be low-tax and low-regulation . 
  things like `` obeying the law '' are pretty fluid concepts when it 's not the little guy . 
  the us in fairness makes an effort on this kind of stuff ( e.g deutsche bank , vw , hsbc etc ) but only when it is n't american companies . 
  pretty standard amount depressingly the us is on about 13-14 per 100,000 [ source ] ( https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/ ) which would put them midway up the table . 
  and likely the poorest areas with the high suicide rates likely are under-reporting as well in the eu . 
  russia is also on about 15 per 100,000 in 2016 and they 're doing really well now compared to ten years ago [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_in_russia#cite_note-1 ) . 
  they 're already complaining about it , they got as screwed as the muslims who voted for trump and ended up with their own families getting deported . 
  leave.eu just said everything to everyone to win and then once they 'd won told everyone to shut the fuck up and stop moaning, 
  i do n't know why dublin keeps coming up as a suggestion . 
  i doubt any single city is going to support all of this and it would be completely looney to try and re-do a single city considering london only grew out of a concentration of insitutions and traders over time in a time before the internet . 
  far more likely is different stuff moves all over according to different needs and requirements and the stuff that needs to stay in london will stay . 
  2016 is over now dear sorry . 
  populism is killing itself under the incompetence and stupidity of its practitioners . 
  no we have a general election under an extremely unrepresentative voting system with only one small party putting forward the case for a single market whos votes are statistically worth far far less than the other two large parties . 
  if remain had won and this had been taken as a mandate to abolish the uk and then an election was `` a consultation on not joining a european state '' you 'd have called it absolute bollocks . 
  just be consistent . 
  the uk is the one that voted to leave the eu but is then even further and with noone being consulted on our single market membership may also seems looking create bureaucracy for workers in a single market and threatening tarrifs if it cant have the same deal as tbe one it doesnt want to pay for . 
  theres a world of difference with an action and a reaction . 
  the whole of brexit and populism is a reaction against free trade and tbe modern economy . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://youtu.be/37ihswa1swe ), 
   but it should n't be a right i disagree , both of our opinions are equally valid . 
  we set up `` the right '' to freedom of movement in the same way as you have `` the right '' to a free trial that was won over centuries of struggle . 
  you 're absolutely correct when talking about australia , but we are not talking about australia we are talking about the 27 other countries in the eu where we had that right . 
  that right is being taken away now ** then ** it will be a privilege for the wealthy . 
  for 0 reason . 
   in terms of rights , it 's now deemed a basic right to have internet access in the world considering how ubiquitous computers are now . 
  but if , in the mid-1990s people tried to claim that internet access is a basic right , they 'd have been laughed at . 
  in some countries internet is a right , because they made it so . 
  likewise freedom of movement was a right , because with 27 other countries we made it so .
