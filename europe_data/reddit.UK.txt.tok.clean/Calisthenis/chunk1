it 's a compliment : your username reads as `` technical tic-tac '' , which i interpreted after reading your post as `` a small , refreshing piece of technicality ( like nitpicking ) '' . 
  i thought it was interesting . 
  username checks out ; and * how * , my friend . 
   eu-constitutionalist eh , good enough . 
  i mean , i ca n't think of a better word . 
  first of all , i never claimed to be anything other than fucked off . 
  there is a tolerant left in this country , but you will not find it here . 
  i also find it rich -- peter mandelson filthy rich -- to be lectured about tolerance at all by a right-winger . 
  the entire foundation of almost your entire side of the political compass is intolerance . 
  secondly : yes absolutely . 
  what , you think the actual number of [ group ] in the country has any bearing on whether the statement `` there are too many [ group ] in the country '' is racist ? 
  the sentiment is racist , and there is no getting around that , however much you may try . 
  and as for your `` logic '' : please , you 're just embarassing yourself . 
  by * my * logic , one can not get from what i said to any statement about borders , but perhaps using * your * `` logic '' , such a leap might yet be possible . 
  go fuck yourself , etc. 
  i am going to bed now . 
  by all means , reply to this , but do not expect a response before much later today . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  there is enough shit coming from people like * you * , * within * the uk without importing extra from fucking europe of all places !, 
  also , listen to yourselves :  but god there are far too many [ polish people ] in the uk they 're saying that there are far too many of a certain nationality in the country . 
  that 's * textbook * racism . 
  imagine instead that they had said one of these :  but god there are far too many [ chinese people ] in the uk . 
   but god there are far too many [ black people ] in the uk . 
   but god there are far too many [ jews ] in the uk . 
   but god there are far too many [ gays ] in the uk . 
   but god there are far too many [ disabled people ] in the uk . 
  insert whatever group you like in the square brackets and you have a template for expressing prejudice for that group . 
  polish people ? 
  ** racism . 
  if you want to be a racist , xenophobic cunt , then please restrict yourself to spouting shit about the netherlands and its residents , and kindly leave the hatred of foreigners in the uk to the british . 
  we have more than enough cunts and cuntiness born and raised here on england 's green and pleasant lands to be getting on with , thank you very much . 
  oh my fucking god , that is excellent ; thank you for that . 
  and it 's true :| the bit about the stronger shite , i mean . 
  came here to see whingeing leavers , was not disappointed . 
  your service is much appreciated . 
  european imperialism best imperialism . 
  ... i 'm not being facetious . 
  perhaps i should be clearer : for a single question in a referendum vote , there must be two and only two options to answer the question . 
  two questions on a single ballots is fine , but they must have essential yes/no answers only . 
  oh yeah , of course , it 's just i had a bit of social paranoia about your response to my `` allegedly '' comment . 
  but it 's all good , 
  the honourable gentleman might think that ; i could n't possibly comment . 
  ( just so there 's no doubt , i am echoing your point . ), 
  what , not trigger article 50 and leave ? 
  legally , there 's nothing even vaguely compelling the government to do anything about leaving the eu . 
   `` the iq of a mob is the iq of its most stupid member divided by the number of mobsters . '', 
  that is absolute gold . 
  thank you for sharing it . 
  rip terry pratchett :(, 
  from kent , can confirm . 
  ( but the death penalty is not a pure question of ethics , and it * does * require you to do your research , e.g. 
  false convictions/exoneration rate , racial bias in the justice system etc. 
  there is very little , if anything that does n't require facts from the real world . ), 
  no , this is the law and they do n't fuck about . 
  the government 's arguments in the high court were shit , and everything i 've heard about their supreme court arguments makes me think that if anything , they 've gotten worse . 
  i 'll admit that my impression of their arguments this time is vague , as i 'm waiting for the judgement ( s ) to come out and summarise them all succinctly . 
  there will probably be some dissensions -- there are 11 ( ! ), 
  justices sitting ( not even the house of lords ever reached so large a panel ) -- but unless the government pulled a miracle out of their arses , or drugged the justices or managed to argue something successfully about the irrevocability of article 50 , the smart money 's on the court ruling that parliament must have a vote . 
  allegedly , m ` lud . 
  you ca n't put more than two options on a single referendum !, 
  then you get into the massive clusterfuck about how you decide the winner in a multi-choice race !, 
  something indicating those as possible consequences under the leave option could be more tenable . 
  or maybe a ** second referendum ** . 
  [ 12.6 % vote share with one mp . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results ), 
  and yet the nazis could n't manage to cross it . 
  what counts as `` terrible '' in france ? 
  since we live in a `` post-truth '' world , we make this true by believing it . 
  you are a people after our own hearts . 
  come , let us talk . 
  do n't actually come and talk . 
  i 'm not your buddy , mate !, 
  nah bruv , allow it . 
  xkcd reference !, 
  ( i do n't actually speak like that , just to clarify ) . 
  itt : non-british europeans nail the sun . 
  i 'm so proud . 
  calculus is n't taught until a-level , at age * 16 * . 
  ` there are three states of legality at irish law : `` that 's grand '' ; `` ah , now , do n't push it '' ; and `` right !, 
  you 're takin ' the piss '' . 
  that 's when the police step in . ', 
  you dirty bastards . 
  ah , now that 'd be an ecumenical matter . 
  and you try and tell the young people of today that , and they wo n't believe you !, 
  do you really find english to be spoken quickly ? 
  i never knew that anybody thought that . 
  i suppose looking back on myself that i 'd always considered english to be a rather slowly spoken language , if anything . 
  except you ca n't rhyme shit ; nope , not one bit -- it just wo n't admit legit wit when it hits it , and although i try to sit and spit lyrics with some grit , it do n't amount to zip and you just got ta say `` i quit '' !, 
  ... it does not , at least not here . 
  `` delightful '' sounds ... wait , no , let me guess ... 
  which college ? 
  and how did your interview ( s ) go ? 
  ( i still do n't know whether mine went well ) . 
  and , er , i was n't asking how . 
  i was saying `` and how ! '', 
  to emphasise my point . 
  i 'm applying to cambridge to read maths , actually , so yes and how !, 
   physics at a-level includes no calculus at all . 
  you could study physics without studying maths . 
  i showed the formula ** f ** = * q *** e ** + * q * ( ** v ** x ** b ** ) to my physics teacher , who was teaching about magnetism , and he said he did n't understand it .
