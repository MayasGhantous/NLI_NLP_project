  it 's slightly faster than most people speak because pmqs only lasts half an hour , but it 's not an uncommon speed . 
  it may just seem quite fast if english is n't your first language ? 
  i can barely understand the french if they do n't speak slowly . 
  generally , it 's just pmqs that are fun to watch . 
  the rest is boring debate and legislation . 
  keep scrolling up ? 
  you said that you did n't believe i held the opinion i stated , and so tried to force yours on me . 
  no , you 're conflating two separate things . 
  the state granting the right to free speech , which is lack of censorship ; and the basic right of free speech , which is accepting contrary opinions exist . 
  the state and the individual are not the only actors in this , free speech governs actions between individuals too , except that that 's not the state 's business . 
   it does n't mean that one has a freedom to compel me , an individual , not to dismiss your opinions if i feel so , because do n't that take away my freedom too ? 
  the right to having your own opinion is not the right to refuse someone else 's opinion . 
  you can dismiss or ignore other opinions as you please ; but you do n't have the right to say someone does n't have any opinion , because then you 're forcing your opinion on them , see ? 
  corporation tax accounts for very little revenue in the grand scheme of things , the lowering it is just to make the uk more competitive against europe and boost confidence . 
  yes , i know , i 've read her book . 
  she wrote under the pseudonym tallentyre and did n't misattribute the quote , but was summarising voltaire 's beliefs , which she succeeded in . 
  that 's why i originally said `` to summarise voltaire 's beliefs . '', 
  the principle of freedom of speech is complicated , but it is n't reserved to the government . 
  voltaire held several opinions which his government was n't particularly fond of , but that does n't mean his thoughts on freedom of speech only involve the government . 
  no , it 's about acknowledging that you do n't hold the only opinion in the world , and that everyone is entitled to one . 
  voltaire disagreed with many people , but he wanted debate and for opposing viewpoints to be heard and shared . 
  i 'm using that quote to illustrate my point , that most people accept that other opinions exist ; and throughout this you 've refused to accept that i have an opinion that you do n't believe fits in your worldview . 
  you 've said it yourself `` if i disagree with it , why should i acknowledge it ? '', 
  because most people acknowledge that other people exist and deserve their own opinions ? 
  if you disagree , you can at least acknowledge that people have their own point of view . 
  to summarise voltaire 's beliefs : ' i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it . ', 
  you 're reading far too much into me from far too little information . 
  i neither want nor need validation from reddit , and i 'm talking not because of sensitivity , but because i enjoy chatting to people who disagree with me . 
  right now , i 'm just curious as to why you apparently refuse to acknowledge another 's opinion because it disagrees with your worldview . 
  because you 're not saying anything potentially incorrect . 
  you 're literally saying you do n't have enough respect for a stranger to think that they could possibly be telling the truth about their own opinion - and that therefore you 'll make an opinion up and give it to them despite their opposition to it . 
  no , it means you have no respect for other people . 
  oh , i know you 're being sarcastic . 
  i just have nothing to say to you since you think people do n't deserve their own opinions , and have to abide by what you think they should think . 
  marvellous , i 'm glad you can finally accept that people make their own opinions . 
   was he in power in ' 52 ? 
  he was pm from ' 58-59 and president from ' 59-69 , as well as winning the post-war elections for leading government , before resigning in protest of communism . 
  are those dates particularly relevant ? 
  also no . 
  despite not being formally in power de gaulle was a prominent figure in french politics , and ultimately , despite schuman , this euroscepticism won out and the original treaty held no mention of political integration . 
  france was not solely for integration . 
  the same holds true for west germany , with the leader of the sdp , schumacher , also being against integration , considering the eec as a device to extend allied control over germany . 
  indeed , the treaty was mainly favourable to the french , and germans opposed this takeover of their industry . 
   were the politicization was that is n't present in '52 where , not were . 
  the treaty of rome established the institutions that later gained political power under maastricht and lisbon . 
  it 's when the process for politicisation began , not when all political power suddenly appeared . 
   `` it was clear from the very start that it was a first step towards a political union : ... a first step in the federation of europe ... schuman declaration 9th may 1950 '' the schuman declaration was not the treaty signed between the founders of the ecsc , merely the eventual aim of schuman himself . 
  the treaty , which laid out the aim of the ecsc , did n't contain measures for political integration . 
   interested in hearing why you claim that it was france that absolutely wanted to keep it to an economic union . 
  does the name de gaulle ring a bell ? 
  he entered purely for french interests and was against any integration which france could n't dominate . 
  even today there are plenty of eurosceptics in france , with hollande saying the eu should scale back its political power . 
  besides it being advertised as an economic one ? 
  here 's the preamble :  `` the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of europe , in which decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen '' . 
  note that it says a union of the peoples of europe , not governments . 
  it does n't contain any mention of political union , and the lower case u is n't suggestive of a formal super-state . 
  taking decisions as close as possible to the people , also implies decentralisation of power , not consolidation . 
  if you continue to read through the articles , there continues to be no mention of political integration , only cooperation and cohesion between members . 
  the only union is the `` economic and monetary union whose currency shall be the euro . '', 
   by creating an ** economic community ** , the foundation of a broad and independent community among peoples long divided by bloody conflicts ; and to lay the bases of institutions capable of giving direction to their ** future common destiny ** [ emphasis mine ] economic community is once again referring to the economic and monetary union , not even a fiscal union which federalists are pushing for now . 
  and future common destiny has nothing to do with political integration , but merely cultural ties . 
  it 's flowery language which has no legal bearing , because it does n't recognise any defined definitions . 
   unless you can point out specific instances where the treaty of rome adds a political component that the ecsc treaty does n't have i 'm going to keep believing that it always was a political project . 
  i have no idea where you 're coming from here . 
  you 're saying that you believe it was always a political project , because the treaty of rome has no mention of a political project in it ? 
  the treaty of paris ( 1951 ) literally says the founders are :  [ `` resolved to substitute for historic rivalries a fusion of their essential interests ; to establish , by creating an economic community , the foundation of a broad and independent community among peoples long divided by bloody conflicts ; and to lay the bases of institutions capable of giving direction to their future common destiny '' ] ( http://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/treaty_establishing_the_european_coal_and_steel_community_paris_18_april_1951-en-11a21305-941e-49d7-a171-ed5be548cd58.html ) and this refers only to economic integration , a common market . 
  you ca n't possibly believe it was always a political project when political integration is never mentioned surely ? 
  the parliament was not designed in its current form . 
  it started off having appointed representatives from national parliaments with no legislative ability , and was a far cry from what the parliament is today , being little more than a glorified talking shop . 
  it may have formed from the common assembly , but it is a vastly different institution today . 
  you 're right on the technicalities of that , the eec is a direct successor of the ecsc . 
  however , my point is that the politicisation came about with the treaty of rome , previously france ensured that only economic integration went ahead , not political integration . 
  with rome , the high authority of the ecsc continued , but two new organisations were created : the european economic community and the european atomic energy community , each which had their own executive commissions . 
  if you want to be pedantic about dates , then the actual commission was created in '65 and took effect in '67 with the merger treaty . 
  but it 's going off on a complete tangent from the main point , which is that most countries only intended the eec to be an economic union , not a political one . 
  will we necessarily need a supernation though ? 
  there are more countries in the world than ever before , in the time of the world wars there were only fifty , now there are five times that . 
   malta has 1/20th of the mep 's germany has . 
  yet only 0.1 % of the population . 
  if it was n't in the eu it would have no way to sway germanies opinion on anything , as it is though any close vote requires people to work with them , and a couple of tiny states can easily block harmful votes . 
  that 's yet another problem with how the eu is set up , regressive proportional representation . 
  how is it fair that malta 's citizens get a far greater voice than germany 's citizens ? 
  sure , they can ` sway germany 's opinion , ' but they would n't need to if they decided on all laws themselves . 
   you do n't understand how scary these things are from the pov of a nation that could be gone in a single day if someone decides it goes . 
  i understand fear even if i 'm not experiencing it myself . 
  but you do n't understand that britain does n't stand for that sort of aggression whether they 're part of or not part of the eu . 
  nato exists to make sure that any invasion does n't happen , and that if it does , there would be serious repercussions . 
  see the german invasion of belgium for one , we liked the germans but we still declared war for them attacking a treaty member . 
   putin decides to manipulate markets to cause a danish bank to fail and threaten their pension system you lack a complete understanding of economics . 
  it 's not possible to subtly mess with another country like that . 
  not even denmark could force a bank to collapse , it 's barely possible . 
  and foreign countries ca n't do subtle . 
  in ukraine putin was literally forced to send in thousands of soldiers and pretend they did n't exist . 
  and country problems are always going to be proportional to a country , the imf is always there to help bail out . 
  you ca n't be destroyed by a bank failure or economic downturn , you can be damaged by sanctions , but that 's it . 
  will the eu come to save banks ? 
  the only reason they 're considering bailouts is because of the euro , not out of any love . 
  greece dying damaged the euro , and an italian bailout would set a precedent for a future german bailout , which is beginning to look quite likely . 
  the eu does n't exist to help all its members , its interests primarily serve germany and france . 
  at the same time , a trade union is all the uk wanted it to be .
