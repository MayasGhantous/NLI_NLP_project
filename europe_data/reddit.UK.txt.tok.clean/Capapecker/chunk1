same shit different dictator . 
  did / r/europe have a meetup in poland ? 
  spark that lit the fuse means `` something that caused something '' i 'm not gon na have this argument , it 's getting late where i am . 
  all the best . 
  if you really think ww1 happened * because * of serbia your understanding of history is limited . 
  serbia was simply the spark that lit the fuse - but it could have happened anywhere . 
  otto von bismarck said it best : `` europe today is a powder keg and the leaders are like men smoking in an arsenal ... a single spark will set off an explosion that will consume us all ... i can not tell you when that explosion will occur , but i can tell you where ... some damned foolish thing in the balkans will set it off . '', 
  - congress of berlin , 1878 . 
  lol serbia did n't dictate european foreign policy . 
  you stumbled into something accidentally historic , but the reasons had nothing to do with serbia . 
  genuinely not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  / r/europe, 
  like this tiny country of 5 million is going to dictate eu policy . 
  i was wondering why this sub became so racist in the last few weeks . 
  did n't realise it was being brigaded . 
  honestly think there 's a case for bringing the immigration threads back . 
  it 's ineffective but atleast it keeps the brigaders away . 
  alexis tsipras really is a political phenomenon . 
  after seven months of turmoil , broken promises , a referendum , a capitulation in brussels , and a split that saw one-third of his mps quit , he 's heading back to the prime minister 's mansion with a similar mandate to the one in january . 
   try and dismiss the fact that wwii was a cataclysmic event that shaped the world when did i say that ? 
  i just said ww1 was a more important event , which is a totally fair academic view to have . 
   ww1 was pretty much a lead up to the world shifting changes of ww2 dismissing ww1 as simply a percursor to ww2 is such a ridiulous thing to say that i 'm not even going to spend time responding to it . 
  i 'd argue those things had a lot more to do with the first world war than the second . 
  this is really rude . 
  apologies to germans who have to read this , i get embarressed by my own countrymen going on about a war that ended 70 years ago , let alone the rest of europe . 
  lol implying that muslims march around saying `` allah ackbar '', 
  when middle easterners hear us saying `` oh my god '' they must think we 're really religious . 
  the truth is it 's hard to sanction a big country like russia . 
  they have so many resourses that it 's hard to `` bring them to their knees '' so to speak . 
  it 'd be the same if you tried to sanction china or the usa . 
  people talk about muslims on this sub today like how people talked about jews in the nineteenth century . 
   free speech and freedom of the press are two different matters . 
  the `` je suis charlie '' movement was about both of those things , however . 
  again , i do n't know enough about french law to know whether these things are legal . 
  all i 'm saying is that to have freedom of speech is to accept that unsavoury things are going to be said that a lot of people do n't like . 
   unless , of course , it was a muslim convention . 
  nice one , i see what you did there . 
  i do n't know what french laws are on free speech . 
  you could in america however , but i do n't think you would get many people to turn up . 
  actually , in a very fundamental sense , they are . 
  `` je suis charlie '' is about the protection of free speech . 
  you ca n't just be in favour of some things and not others . 
  because `` je suis charlie '' cuts both ways . 
  hating `` everything '' about russia is just a ridiculous opinion . 
   you will hardly find a bigger rusophobe than me ... i actually have a strong distaste for russian people 's mentality , nation , history and most things coming from there . 
  welcome to / r/europe everyone . 
  +153 points . 
   yep until they instill sharia law in certain neighborhoods just like in england or france . 
  do n't believe everything you read , mate . 
  oh , well , if / u/nopenopenoped says it 's true then it must be . 
  sorry for doubting you . 
  that 's a silly comment . 
  i dislike russia 's actions as much as the next guy but there 's no point in blind hatred . 
  is that * really * the best comeback you could think of ? 
  lol gemany got massive debt relief after ww2 but no-one has a go at them for that . 
  i was kind-of hoping that was in the terms and conditions of the deal . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  for finns for vote in favour it would bring down their entire government , so of course they are not going to do it . 
  but i suppose this is one problem of many . 
  yes , britain probably * is n't * going to leave the eu . 
  but you 'd be a fool to go purely by opinion polls , especially after the last election . 
  e /  fuehrer merkel also , do n't say stuff like this . 
  it 's not funny and makes us look bad . 
  [ this article says he thinks greece should maintain its membership of the euro . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11566624/euclid-tsakalotos-yanis-varoufakis-greece-new-finance-minister.html ), 
  thank you !, 
  i ca n't tell if this is a genius game of good-cop/bad-cop by the greece government . 
  get one finance minister who says really inflammatory things and really pumps up the eurozone . 
  call a referendum and reject the first bailout package . 
  get rid of [ `` bad-cop '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mvdq7zt.jpg ) even though you 've won the referendum and replace him with [ `` good-cop '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lrsrzsu.jpg ) and watch all the ez countries rush to make a deal thinking it 's their only chance . 
  or syriza are winging it and do n't know what they 're doing day to day . 
  could be either , honestly . 
  brainwashed is a strong word . 
  but nevertheless it must be said newspapers affect public opinion . 
  i 've noticed that most of the people who have vitriolic hatred of varoufakis happen to have german flair . 
  i wonder if it has anything to do with your newspapers . 
  it 's depressing . 
  basically `` all immigrants are aweful except eu ones . '', 
  i come from an area of the uk heavily effected by immigration , and the vast majority of people integrate just fine . 
  i 'd agree our growth rate is a little bit too high , but we 're nowhere near collapse like some people in this thread would have you believe . 
  it 's aweful . 
  they 're coming over here , taking over the anti-uk threads . 
  who do they think they are . 
  i think we should really question the freedom of threads , and instead implement an australian-style points system . 
  * grumble grumble *, 
  yeah , it 's kind of confusing . 
  non fee-paying schools are known as ` comprehensives ' . 
  i do n't think the czech republic has its own supply of gas , [ it imports from russia ] ( http://static.businessinsider.com/image/5315eab0ecad04d15f6f611c-1200/image.jpg ) . 
  i suppose poland is just diversifying its sources . 
  this sub has got to the point where i ca n't tell whether you 're joking or not . 
  glorious sleep !, 
  he was supservient in a lot of ways , see : [ bill of rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bill_of_rights_1689 ) compare this to our last invader [ william the conqueror ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_the_conqueror ) who pretty much did whatever the fuck he wanted . 
  i honestly do n't even know why we 're arguing this . 
  it really does n't matter in the grand scheme of things , and can be interpreted either way . 
  i 'm going to get some sleep . 
  once he was invited he still had to [ wrangle with parliament ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_iii_of_england#proclaimed_king ) :  when the majority of tory lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler , william threatened to leave the country immediately . 
  furthermore , mary , remaining loyal to her husband , refused . 
  being subservient to parliament are not the hall marks of a `` conquering invader '' . 
  he was always at the mercy of parliament , and he knew it . 
  you 've triggered so many english people by calling the glorius revolution an invasion .
