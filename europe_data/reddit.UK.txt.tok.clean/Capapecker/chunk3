  hey man that 's our job . 
  we 've had 53 prime ministers in total , 40 of which were either educated at oxford or cambridge . 
  so yeah , you 're right . 
   they 're not now , back when the first leadership campaign was going they were all corbyn fanboys . 
  i do n't deny . 
  it 's changed since then though . 
  the dichotomy between / r/unitedkingdom and / r/ukpolitics is hilarious . 
  they both hate each other . 
  they 're not actually that pro-corbyn . 
  i do n't know why people think this ... 
  i mean , [ check any recent thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/58heks/tories_extend_their_lead_in_the_opinion_polls_to/ ) , plenty of corbyn critisism . 
  when i was at school , i was always taught that the reason the austo-hungarian army was so useless was because there we 're so many languages/cultures in it that it ceased to function . 
  how would a european army , with literally dozens of languages and cultures , function exactly ? 
  presumably there would have to be a primary language - and presumable also it would have to be english . 
  it 's the most widely second language in the eu , and people are n't exactly going to start learning french/german just for military purposes . 
  and if it is english , wo n't france lose its shit ? 
  it 's also awkward for the eu to use a language of a country about to leave the eu all together . 
  i totally did n't get it either . 
  no one has said it but there 's certainly a sentiment . 
  how much does germany pay on defence , 1 % ? 
  is it even that ? 
  it 's not right , and i do n't see why people are getting defensive . 
  a lot of americans are very poor . 
  but they still pay their tax dollars subsidising our armies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis the opec countries can certainly effect world oil prices if they feel diplomatically slighted by the west . 
  i was mainly responding to the comment further up . 
  if we tell every muslim country to go fuck themselves i 'd expect we will see an effect on oil prices . 
  i mean , all that jingoistic stuff sound great on a internet forum . 
  but in the real world it 's totally useless . 
  we ca n't impose our beliefs and values on other countries , however virtuous we think they might be . 
  we have to work with these countries . 
  and we ca n't do it be knocking down every cultural belief they have . 
  ca n't endsy the renzi . 
  okay that was rubbish . 
  look forward to oil prices surging up . 
  these people do n't think about geopolitical repercussions . 
  we do n't * have * to , you 're right . 
  we have the choice not to go to iran and these countries , but we do anyway . 
  it 's really basic stuff than can improve relations between countries . 
  and , i mean , the hijab is n't that bad . 
  i have an issue with the burka , which i think is clearly misogynistic . 
  but the hijab is basically just a scarf , and can come in all different styles and patterns . 
  this sub is so hypocritical sometimes . 
  they act like the ministers should have walked in with bikini suits on or something . 
  iran has the right to expect people to follow their culture norm , as do we . 
  i mean if you 're going to someone 's country you might as well respect their culture . 
  is n't that what you guys always complain about foreigners coming here ? 
  the battle-lines are drawn . 
  when the world 's big trading nations convene this week at a g20 summit in hamburg , the stage is set for a clash between a protectionist america and a free-trading germany . 
  president donald trump has already pulled out of one trade pact , the trans-pacific partnership , and demanded the renegotiation of another , the north american free-trade agreement . 
  he is weighing whether to impose tariffs on steel imports into america , a move that would almost certainly provoke retaliation . 
  the threat of a trade war has hung over the trump presidency since january . 
  in contrast , angela merkel , germany 's chancellor and the summit 's host , will bang the drum for free trade . 
  in a thinly veiled attack on mr trump , she delivered a speech on june 29th condemning the forces of protectionism and isolationism . 
  an imminent free-trade deal between japan and the european union will add substance to her rhetoric ( see article ) . 
  there is no question who has the better of this argument . 
  mr trump 's doctrine that trade must be balanced to be fair is economically illiterate . 
  his belief that tariffs will level the playing field is naive and dangerous : they would shrink prosperity for all . 
  but in one respect , at least , mr trump has grasped an inconvenient truth . 
  he has admonished germany for its trade surplus , which stood at almost $ 300bn last year , the world 's largest ( china 's hoard was a mere $ 200bn ) . 
  his threatened solution -- to put a stop to sales of german cars -- may be self-defeating , but the fact is that germany saves too much and spends too little . 
  and the size and persistence of germany 's savings hoard makes it an awkward defender of free trade . 
  ** imperfect harmony ** at bottom , a trade surplus is an excess of national saving over domestic investment . 
  in germany 's case , this is not the result of a mercantilist government policy , as some foreigners complain . 
  nor , as german officials often insist , does it reflect the urgent need for an ageing society to save more . 
  the rate of household saving has been stable , if high , for years ; the increase in national saving has come from firms and the government . 
  underlying germany 's surplus is a decades-old accord between business and unions in favour of wage restraint to keep export industries competitive ( see article ) . 
  such moderation served germany 's export-led economy well through its postwar recovery and beyond . 
  it is an instinct that helps explain germany 's transformation since the late 1990s from europe 's sick man to today 's muscle-bound champion . 
  there is much to envy in germany 's model . 
  harmony between firms and workers has been one of the main reasons for the economy 's outperformance . 
  firms could invest free from the worry that unions would hold them to ransom . 
  the state played its part by sponsoring a system of vocational training that is rightly admired . 
  in america the prospects for men without college degrees have worsened along with a decline in manufacturing jobs -- a cause of the economic nationalism espoused by mr trump . 
  germany has not entirely escaped this , but it has held on to more of the sorts of blue-collar jobs that america grieves for . 
  this is one reason why the populist afd party remains on the fringes of german politics . 
  but the adverse side-effects of the model are increasingly evident . 
  it has left the german economy and global trade perilously unbalanced . 
  pay restraint means less domestic spending and fewer imports . 
  consumer spending has dropped to just 54 % of gdp , compared with 69 % in america and 65 % in britain . 
  exporters do not invest their windfall profits at home . 
  and germany is not alone ; sweden , switzerland , denmark and the netherlands have been piling up big surpluses , too . 
  for a large economy at full employment to run a current-account surplus in excess of 8 % of gdp puts unreasonable strain on the global trading system . 
  to offset such surpluses and sustain enough aggregate demand to keep people in work , the rest of the world must borrow and spend with equal abandon . 
  in some countries , notably italy , greece and spain , persistent deficits eventually led to crises . 
  their subsequent shift towards surplus came at a heavy cost . 
  the enduring savings glut in northern europe has made the adjustment needlessly painful . 
  in the high-inflation 1970s and 1980s germany 's penchant for high saving was a stabilising force . 
  now it is a drag on global growth and a target for protectionists such as mr trump . 
  ** the shift from thrift ** can the problem be fixed ? 
  perhaps germany 's bumper trade surplus will be eroded as china 's was , by a surge in wages . 
  unemployment is below 4 % and the working-age population will shrink , despite strong immigration . 
  after decades of decline , the cost of housing is rising , meaning that pay does not stretch as far as it used to . 
  the institutions behind wage restraint are losing influence . 
  the euro may surge . 
  yet the german instinct for caution is deeply rooted . 
  pay rose by just 2.3 % last year , more slowly than in the previous two years . 
  left to adjust , the surplus might take many years to fall to a sensible level . 
  the government should help by spending more . 
  germany 's structural budget balance has gone from a deficit of over 3 % of gdp in 2010 to a small surplus .
