   lee rigby was off duty and absolutely no threat to them you idiot . 
  your analogies are laughable . 
  and a cargo plane full of non combative personnel was a threat ? 
  of course not . 
  it really is pathetic how wrapped up in your own ideology you are , that you are putting so much effort into defending a bunch of incompetent murderers . 
   why is it sickening ? 
  no one should be beyond defense if there is a legitimate argument for that defense , and i believe the fact they almost definitely did n't want to do what they did is a legitimate defense . 
  murder is still murder . 
  if you mean to kill someone , but accidentally kill someone else , you are no less guilty . 
  these people fired at an unidentified aircraft , they `` believed '' it to be a cargo plane , so were `` only '' trying to murder 50 non combative operatives , but they ended up killing 300 . 
  if you are walking down the street and see an off duty police officer you do n't like , and decide to stab them , but then realise you go the wrong person , how much `` compassion '' do you deserve ? 
  should we say , he was `` only '' trying to kill a cop , so him killing an ordinary person does n't matter as much ? 
  since you seem to believe that these `` rebels '' should be able to legitimately target ukrainian soldiers . 
  do you also believe that people like the men who murdered lee rigby also had a legitimate reason for doing so , or that they deserve compassion ? 
   in a war what war ? 
  ukraine was n't at war with anyone . 
   you do n't say `` well , the inexperienced rebels probably do n't have a weapon that can shoot down a civilian airliner , might as well let them through . 
  and push their flight path 300 miles more to the north than usual , right into a war zone . 
  and lower their elevation from 35,000 to 33,000 ft. '', 
  well if only you have been around to explain that to the hundreds of experts across multiple government and airlines who decided the danger was not sufficient to stop going through that airspace . 
   kiev also pushed the narrative since the beginning that russians were involved in eastern ukraine . 
  either they were lying , or they should have known that there is a possibility that the russians would have brought in heavy artillery . 
  so russia was behind all of this then ? 
  it is absolutely hilarious that you can say that , and yet still be blaming the airlines , and not the people who shot down the aircraft . 
  russia lied about its involvement . 
  it said it was not involved at all . 
  it was only through russian actions that the `` rebels '' would be able to get a hold of the aa weapons needed to shoot down the aircraft . 
  i agree with you 100 % that the russian government is full of lying scum who should never be trusted again , but at the time , russia was claiming it had no involvement , so the necessary precautions were taken . 
  as it turned out , russia was lying , so the only mistake that was really made was to trust anything the russians had said . 
   you do n't see the difference between killing military combatants of a government you are at war with and civilians , including children , of a neutral nation ? 
  well the rebels certainly did n't . 
  who was ukraine at war with ? 
  i thought they were n't involved . 
  what about the rebels ? 
  there was no war , putin kept telling us as much . 
  the `` rebels '' started the conflict , and ukraine was simply trying to maintain peace within its own boarders . 
  russia and the `` rebels '' it was paying were nothing more than cowards who refused to confront ukraine and the rest of the world directly . 
  they refused to go to war because they knew the world would be against them and they would lose . 
  they are murderers , not soldiers , and incompetent ones at that . 
  i think your lack of compassion , and you attempts to defend the actions of murderers is quite sickening to be honest . 
  so like i said , they took precautions , but they underestimated the danger . 
  nobody could have predicted that they had weapons sophisticated enough to shoot down an aircraft up to 70,000 feet . 
  the last military cargo plane they shot down had about 50 people on it , who all died . 
  mh17 had about 300 people . 
  so no , i do n't really see much of a difference to be honest . 
  they were willing to kill a lot of people , whatever happened . 
   it 's easy to talk about hindsight over a warzone where no plane has yet to be shot down but they actually shot quite a few military aircrafts but not in that area . 
  again , if this was the fault of the airline , then why did none of the international airlines that fly through the area stop using that airspace ? 
   there really is no excuse , ukraine is n't a big country , ukraine is an enormous country . 
  the distance between where this aircraft was shot down , and where other aircraft in the country were shot down , is greater than the distance across some european countries . 
  you should focus your accusations on the people who shot down the aircraft , and the people who funded them , the airlines and the people who died are the victims , not the people to blame . 
  that 's easy to say with hindsight . 
  the real blame is with the people who shot down the aircraft , and the people who helped them to do it . 
  i do n't see any reason to blame the airlines for what happened . 
  they took precautions , but you can not predict the future . 
  the flight restrictions that were put in place by most airlines did not include the area where the plane was shot down , so you ca n't really blame them for flying through the area . 
  what does mistaken identity have to do with anything ? 
  they should n't have been shooting at anyone . 
  which is why we should help turkey in the process of figuring out who is a genuine refugee , taking on some of that burden , and sending the rest back . 
  turkey just allowing people to illegally pass through their country into europe does n't help anyone and makes the whole situation more difficult . 
  since the eu is going to be spending a vast amount of money money trying to fix the migrant crisis anyway , this is exactly the sort of thing they should be helping to fund . 
  there were talks of setting up migrant camps outside of europe to house refugees , this seems like the perfect opportunity for just that . 
  if turkey is our ally they will be willing to work with us to solve the problem , and prevent these migrants from getting here . 
  actually i think the bombings are in peoples minds a lot more this year , because of the attack in tunisia , and this might be reflected in the medias coverage . 
  as i said in the other thread you posted this , by your figures , just over 2 % of the uk is `` built on '' . 
  but we use over 70 % of the uk land space for agriculture . 
  that means that at the moment , 1 % of `` built on '' land need 35 % of the land space of the uk to support it . 
  how much would 3 % or 4 % use ? 
  its fine to say that we can just import more food , but the world is facing a food shortage . 
  to reduce our own food production in order to build more houses , putting even more pressure on the global food shortage and leading to more people starving seems selfish . 
   people in japan enjoy a high quality of life , and the country is full of huge swathes of rural land and areas natural beauty in addition to large cities . 
  that level of population density is hardly the end of the world . 
  japan also has a very homogeneous culture , which is undoubtedly a factor . 
  [ at least he did n't get thrown off the boat on the way here .

   it does n't have a history of being a secular state , it has a history of being a secular state with a lot of muslims , a secular state is one where the government is run in a religiously neutral way , as opposed to one that favors a single religion . 
  that is the difference between indonesia and the majority of those on the bottom of the list . 
  it was run as a secular state for decades . 
  the link i provided described indonesia as `` the smiling islam '' , and explains how it was well known for its ** tolerant ** version of islam . 
  that is the big clue as to why there is more ** tolerance ** towards women today . 
  you are accusing me of oversimplifying things by saying that the issue all the counties on the bottom of the list have in common is islam , but then you yourself are taking the overly simplistic view that all muslims are the same , and all muslim countries should preform the same for women 's rights . 
  that is simply not the case , countries which are governed strictly in accordance with islamic scriptures , hard line islamic theocracies such as iran , or islamic monarchy 's such as saudi arabia will always be more oppressive towards women and minorities . 
  states which are run in a secular fashion , which allow freedom of religion , and of political thought , such as indonesia will not suffer these problems . 
  you edited your post while i was replying , and added the part about indonesia . 
  to answer that question , the difference between indonesia and many other muslim countries , is that indonesia has a history of operating as a secular state . 
  for many years it was considered one of the most moderate muslim countries in the world , and as such , women 's rights were respected much more than in other muslim countries . 
  however , growing religious intolerance from parts of the muslim population are changing things for the [ worst . 
  ] ( http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/11/indonesia-women-srightsvirginitytestsfemalepoliceofficers.html ) this is a good [ article ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/blog/paradox-indonesia%e2%80%99s-democracy-and-religious-freedom#.vynrifm4rqi ) explaining the religious and political history of indonesia . 
  nope . 
  only a couple of the bottom 20 are war torn . 
  and it does n't have much to do with how poor they are either . 
  madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world , but is about 100 places above the bottom 20 , while saudi arabia is in the top 20 in terms of wealth , but bottom 20 in terms of gender equality . 
  many of the bottom 20 are n't particularly poor , egypt , pakistan , morocco , iran ect . 
   segregation of women in businesses is not a majority practice in europe . 
  it has historically been a problem of less women being hired into top business positions and political offices , but things are improving rapidly in those areas . 
  this shows that western society , and the `` old conservatives '' you were complaining about , are actually making progress . 
   as for beliefs about inherent inferiority of women or ( especially ) homosexuals , these are considerably more widespread in our society and only discussing them in the context of one specific minority is intellectually dishonest . 
  they are more widespread in western culture than islamic culture ? 
  where is your evidence for that ? 
   speaking of being intellectually dishonest , i ca n't help but notice that you 've dodged the part of my post that explains that it is not the muslims that hold western society back when it comes to gender and marriage equality .
