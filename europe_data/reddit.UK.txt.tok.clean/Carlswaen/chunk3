  it 'll be a good idea for your broker . 
  it 's okay . 
  some of us are working to re-brand it operation toodle pip . 
  apologies , i misunderstood and thought you were having a pop at me . 
  although you might want to take them seriously and it was written as tweets as i described , which explains the vernacular . 
  it was lord digby jones , former director general of the pro-eu cbi , a massive leader in industry , minister of state for trade and investment under gordon brown even though he refused to join the labour party but still appointed - a first . 
  he 's been approached before to front the leave campaign and always said he 'd wait until the terms of the deal were known . 
  he 's a big hitter .

  not that long off . 
  merkel has already spoken to cameron about allowing it as part of a concession for his ` deal ' , and cameron wo n't be around after 2020 to okay anything - so anticipating moving ahead before then , if not quite completing . 
  statistically not as many as you 'd think and most of them have pension and retirement packages ready to mature . 
   however , the government 's efforts are not so far reversing the decline in the uk presence . 
  in relation to its share of the eu 's population ( 12.5 % ) , the uk remains significantly under-represented among the staff of the major eu institutions , and its presence continues to shrink . 
  we were seriously concerned to learn that the number of uk nationals on the staff of the european commission has fallen by 24 % in seven years , and now stands at 4.6 % of the total . 
  this compares to 9.7 % for france , which has almost the same share of the eu 's population . 
  in the increasingly-powerful european parliament , the uk 's share of administrator-grade staff has fallen from 6.2 % to 5.8 % since 2010 ( while france 's has risen from 7.5 % to 8.6 % ) ; and in the general secretariat of the council of the eu the uk 's share of administrator-grade staff fell from 4.8 % to 4.3 % over the same period ( while france 's fell from 7.7 % to 6.9 % ) . 
  the chief cause of the current decline is the fact that , forty years after the uk joined the then-european economic community in 1973 , the cohort of uk officials who went then to work for the eu institutions ( especially the european commission ) is reaching retirement age . 
  the uk staff presence at middle-ranking and more junior and entry levels in the commission is insufficient to compensate for the exit of senior uk officials . 
  even if uk representation at entry levels were to start to pick up , the government must therefore reckon with what the foreign secretary has correctly identified as a ` generation gap ' in the uk presence in the european commission , and with declining uk representation at the most senior levels there in the medium term . 
  http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmfaff/219/219.pdf article 49 of the eu staff regulation says they could be forced to go because they no longer fulfill article 28a , but it does n't have to be invoked . 
  so hire them or fire them , but many will have golden parachutes . 
  damn , it 's off to the burn ward for me . 
  because that 's what being in political union means , you all get a say , and this would have protected their right to at least have their say heard and not their hands forced . 
  if you do n't like having a say on others , or others having a say on you , then you really should n't be supporting anything akin to political union . 
  i 'm pro leave as they come , and whilst i appreciate there 's no legal weight behind it and it 's got more holes in it than soft joe , and it still has to be ratified , and is dependent on the uk signing and ratifying the next treaty - i still could n't believe that the `` ever closer union '' article in the deal was uk specific . 
  it should have applied to everyone , so any country at any time could call ` woah ' if they thought they were going in too deep . 
  i 'm amazed that these reforms are n't eu wide reforms , because that is what the eu sceptics that could be swayed to vote to stay were asking for . 
  it was the perfect opportunity to spring clean for everyone , but it 's simply not happened . 
  one of the people who will probably become a key player in the uk leave campaign has just said via twitter : `` we r not being asked 2 remain in or leave a reformed eu , our relationship with the eu is being reformed but the eu itself is not reforming and that will drag us ( and them ) down . '', 
  they actually wanted the reforms not to be just about the uk . 
  i do n't know what the leaders have been playing at . 
  people vote for parties , and you do n't have to take my word . 
  they all took to the stage for the european election debates and described federal goals . 
  it would be if it was part of a treaty change . 
  instead it 's more of a pinky promise that it 'll be included in the next treaty which will give the eu more powers - and it would still have to be ratified . 
  so it 's a big if , with no guarantees , and only if we agree to the next treaty the eu puts out which invariably will push for more powers . 
  and why the exception of only the uk ? 
  why not remove it altogether because if it 's only in the uk it means them being in political union with a superbloc which obliged in different directions and signed up to `` ever closer union '' . 
  that 's a terrible deal . 
  cameron promised real treaty change . 
  where is it ? 
  tony blair already gave away most of the rebate on a promise for real cap reform , and that never appeared either . 
  it needs to be in black and white saying this is done , signed , sealed , delivered . 
  no backsies . 
  * and then , and only then would he have had the start of a deal . 
   federalists are a minority in europe . 
  not going by european parties they 're not . 
  european people 's party ( epp ) - 216 meps - federalist ( actually the party the uk conservatives left because they were so federalist ) . 
  progressive alliance of socialists and democrats ( s&d ) - 190 meps - federalist . 
  alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ( alde ) - 69 meps - federalist . 
  there 's more smaller groups which are also federalists but i 'm stopping there because that 's already a clear majority . 
  we need to elect an autistic savant . 
  it 's already 2016 . 
  if we 're going to meet our quota of saving europe twice in a century it 's about time we got cracking . 
  [ ducks for cover ], 
  part of the david cameron renegotiation . 
  try not to mention it . 
  or at least not for a couple of months and then just let them sneak back in . 
  honestly ? 
  you 're all outrageously impressive . 
  so much so i wonder if some people are n't intimidated by it all into lurking and not commenting , or if you 're all bitches lying about your flairs and secretly hailing from bedfordshire , suffolk , or sumfink . 
  it 's actually very easy to forget that some of you are doing the mental linguistic chop-suey juggle sometimes . 
   there are about 60 british directors in the commission . 
  but they 're expected to get a `` golden handshake , '' under article 50 of the staff rules . 
  they earn some $ 15,000 a month . 
  they would be paid about 70 percent for the first five years , then 60 percent . 
  but when their pension starts , they would get up to 70 percent again . 
  maybe we could set up some sort of emergency relief fund to get them through the hard times ahead . 
  that and they have unemployment rate [ estimated at 44.6 % ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=unemployment+in+bosnia&amp;oq=unemployment+in+bosnia&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0l2j0i22i30l8.794251.803712.0.804061.50.27.2.5.6.0.151.2094.4j14.18.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..28.22.1791.mie1ydxvtkg ) in 2014 they had the world 's highest youth unemployment rate . 
  sorry , i 'm going to have to do it to you again . 
  you do n't have to have free movement of people through efta either . 
  your link specifically says it is a trait of the eea which it describes as a market that links with efta and the eu . 
  switzerland agreed to free movement of people and signed up to it in 1999 and implemented it in 2002 as part of bilateral i. efta 's 55 years old but when switzerland negotiates as an efta member it 's not redefining efta for the other members . 
  they 're not bossing liechtenstein around and dictating new efta terms to them . 
  it 's a swiss-eu negotaitated bilateral deal . 
  if the uk rejoined efta free movement of people would have to be included in an * additional * bilateral agreement for it to apply .

   that wo n't happen , to be part of the efta you need to be part of schengen . 
  no you do n't . 
  switzerland negotiated that in its bilaterals . 
  switzerland only joined schengen in 2004 , implemented it in 2008 , and completed it in 2009 . http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-s-schengen-entry-finally-complete/653802, 
   even in an orwellian dystopia you ca n't control some ones thoughts . 
  spoiler below ... . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ^ ^ / ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ according ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ end ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ book , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yes ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ can . 
  ( in the real world with things like stockholm syndrome , the milgram experiment , and even historic lessons around extremism from the 20th century , one of the lessons we should never forget is that humans are actually very easily manipulated with the right amount of leverage in the right place and the right time . ), 
  they vote like madmen , they attend endless committees after committees like madmen , they pump out regulation and ruling like mad men , but it 's all measured in terms of quantity over quality . 
  they 're not legislators , that 's the commission . 
  the meps like those in ukip are more often than not making speeches either in an empty parliament ( they put a lot more parliamentary and plenary youtube videos out than the other parties ) , and they 're more likely to be seen giving interviews in the atrium outside than in a committee ( although it 's typically around 2/3rd attendance ) - but the time when they 're not there they 're not signing in . 
  so they 're not part of the s.i. ; s.o. 
  brigade , or sign in ; slope off who embezzle daily allowances shown in the video in the link below : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10141790/fury-caught-on-film-as-meps-sign-in-and-slope-off.html the good news is that catharine bearder has now been elected one of five eu qaestors ; the bureau that `` shall lay down rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to members '' . 
  so if there 's any truth to the allegation all catharine will have to do with her new position is to stand in the same hallway the journalist in the link does , and she 'd have them all bang to rights . 
  unless of course she ca n't because they 're not among those that do it ... poor attendance means not claiming all their allowances . 
  she ca n't have it both ways . 
  and again , she 'd have known that . 
  it 's worse than that , i 'm afraid . 
  most newly elected meps do n't know what meps do . 
  i recall conservative mep dan hannan told a story after the may 2014 election about how one of his new colleagues was all geed up . 
  they 'd just spent the day in the chamber in an endless voting cycle after being shown their new offices - and they turn to dan and say , `` so when do we get down to the real work ? '', 
  and dan gets to see a little bit of their soul die as he tells him , `` this is it . '',
