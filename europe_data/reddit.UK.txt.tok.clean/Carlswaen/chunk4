  as legislators go they 're toothless and it 's all so very protracted and drawn out . 
  a lot of it is about self-import and appearances . 
  the air of presentation but not much tangible . 
  i 'm not sure why she insists on breaking character sometimes to make these sort of arguments . 
  she must know they 're not grounded in truth . 
  it 's as if it 's about promoting the project at all costs rather than winning the argument by weighing up the pros and cons . 
   now , as british conservative eurosceptics such as daniel hannan argue , perhaps it is time for the uk to embrace fast-growing emerging economies in the commonwealth at the expense of the eu . 
  this argument deliberately plays to those who yearn back to the days of empire . 
  not at expense of trade with the eu . 
  none of the eurosceptic groups in the uk want to pull down the shutters and cast their trade off . 
  they all value eu trade and wish for it to long continue . 
  they have no problem with trade . 
  it 's a relationship around political union which they can ; t get alongside . 
   but the problem for british eurosceptics is that their nostalgic vision does not seem to be shared by the uk 's commonwealth allies themselves . 
  on the contrary the commonwealth allies have made both the harare and singapore declarations . 
  the harare declaration was made around the same time as maastricht and the launch of the single market : `` the singapore declaration had committed the commonwealth to several principles in 1971 : world peace and support for the united nations ; individual liberty and egalitarianism ; opposition to racism ; opposition to colonialism ; the eradication of poverty , ignorance , disease , and economic inequality ; free trade ; institutional co-operation ; multilateralism opposition to colonialism and promote free trade among members - so when she presents it has harking back to empire and they do n't want to trade she 's arguing opposites . 
  it specifically states in the text : '' [ t ] he freest possible flow of multilateral trade on terms fair and equitable to all , taking account of the special requirements of developing countries ; '' so when she presents a false impression of aloof trade she is preying on the fears and ignorance of people not in her position . 
  http://thecommonwealth.org/sites/default/files/history-items/documents/harare%20commonwealth%20declaration%201991.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harare_declaration  and just this week sir ronald sanders , a senior jamaican diplomat and candidate to become the next secretary-general of the commonwealth , argued that there is no need for the uk to choose between the two organisations . 
  there 's not . 
  that 's the eurosceptic case when it comes to trade . 
  just as assuredly that we currently trade now with jamaica from within a customs union and with a common external tariff through the wto , we 'd trade with the eu even in the absence of a trade agreement outside the customs union . 
  but the majority of uk trade does now lie outside the eu and the emerging markets are in the commonwealth . 
  it 's not choosing which to alienate it 's calibrating to make the best of both worlds . 
   the eu currently has trade deals in force with eighteen commonwealth countries and has completed negotiations with fourteen more , including canada and singapore . 
  last month the european commission announced an ambitious new global trade agenda that will see the launch of talks with australia , new zealand and hong kong . 
  an even bigger prize , an eu trade agreement with india , is also looking increasingly likely after talks were revived earlier this year . 
  which is absolutely great news . 
  but what she 's saying is that all our commonwealth friends will be getting a relationship based on trade , without political union , and access to the single market . 
  precisely what the uk eurosceptics want . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  so why can they have it but it 'd be doom for the uk ? 
  her argument does n't add up . 
   at a time when the eu is buckling under the strain of multiple crises and growth in the eurozone remains sluggish , the idea that the uk could somehow cut itself loose from the continent rebuild a modern version of the british empire is undeniably tempting . 
  see what she 's done again ? 
  nobody is talking about building a new british empire . 
  the actual idea behind the commonwealth was that all countries however big or small , rich or poor , old or new , would be considered equals and have the same vote - but with no political union . 
  it 's the antonym of empire . 
  \\ [ cough-cough - [ ** barroso actually said the eu was about building an empire ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ralocq9ue ) ( although he does say it is not about central diktat although i 'm not sure how that stands up in the wake of what has happened to greece ) , and [ ** blair said it was about power not peace . 
  ** ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/blair-case-europe-power-not-peace-302571 ) ]  by staying in the eu and continuing to be a powerful voice for openness , fairness and free trade , britain can have the best of both worlds . 
  but that 's not the problem . 
  sure we 'd almost certainly be able to have more bespoke free trade deals with our commonwealth friends and negotiating as part of a 28 member bloc is monolithic with the maneuverability of an oil tanker - but we want a relationship based on trade not political union . 
  precisely what she 's saying is on offer for other commonwealth members . 
  not the point she wanted to make but by misrepresenting what it is uk eurosceptics are pursuing she 's actually made quite a big admission . 
  catherine bearder seems to be suggesting that the other commonwealth nations are getting precisely the sort of relationship which will satisfy the uk euroscepticism and which will allow the rump-eu left to pursue their goals of ever closer union and federalism after we 've left . 
   ** but you can be sure we 'd have to follow all the eu rules as norway and switzerland do ** all the rules ? 
  that 's not accurate at all , catherine . 
  norway voluntarily opts into more eu law than it is obliged to but a country like iceland outside the eu but a member of the eea only adopts around 10 % of eu acquis . 
  http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2015/10/21/iceland_has_adopted_10_prosent_of_eu_laws/ as for `` pay a hefty sum for the privilege '' surely you know that the main leave campaigns have all gravitated so far around a wto-fta based model ? 
  on that note , eszter zalan quoted you in the euobserver last month ( november 25th ) comparing a brexit to a marriage divorce : `` you do n't give them the front-door key and tell them to use the sitting room any time they like . '', 
  yet you also seem to be aware that the uk would have access to the ` sitting room ' through the wto . 
  you spoke to roberto azev\u00eado , the director-general of the world trade organization in february last year at the european parliament 's international trade committee . 
  at the time you claimed he had warned the uk over an eu exit . 
  what he actually said was , `` i think that 's a call that the uk will have to make for itself . '', 
  he did go on to say , `` but of course , the more that a country or a member is in a position to join with others in defending a particular idea or defending a particular agenda , the easier it is to push through its interests . ', 
  but the lib dem perspective alas * is n't * the democratic uk perspective . 
  what you campaign for at the heart of the eu is n't what the uk wants at the ballot . 
  when he talks about pressing a common agenda it 's a common agenda you have with the eu not the uk . 
  the eu 's agenda is ever closer union . 
  you share that agenda . 
  support for that in the uk however barely breaks through the teens in polling . 
  respectfully you 've only got one mep however good she is . 
  the shared interests of the director-general could just as easily be interpreted as taking back the uk 's negotiation seat at the wto where we could push our interests through with the anglosphere and commonwealth . 
  having said that , are you still of the same mind regarding the wto , even now though the foreign affairs committee , convened to assess the costs and benefits of leaving the eu , heard just a month ago that outside eu protectionism the uk could enjoy an 8 % reduction in the cost of living on day one ? '', 
  that is does the progression of the eu agenda at its very heart , ever closer union , even take priority if it becomes evident it is to our own economic detriment ? 
  is it really not a case that when people say we have more influence being in the eu , it 's more a case of saying liberal democrats are n't particularly well represented in the uk , and that the director general was actually advising that if the uk has more in common with the larger members of the commonwealth and the anglosphere then it 'd be better off leaving and retaking its seat . 
  i think you heard what you wanted to hear - but 8 % reduction in the cost of living on day one and on the assumption no fta deal being struck ... 
  this `` hefty sum '' contribution through a wto or fta route ? 
  zero . 
  as former iod economist ruth lea points out , the average cet tariff the uk would pay without an fta deal would be 1-2 % . 
  easily within the realms of being offset as a net importer and with an 8 % reduction in the cost of living .

  ** `` access '' ? 
  you do n't have to be a member of something to have access to it . 
  thirteen of the eu 's top 20 trade partners , including all top 3 , trade with the eu 's single market through the wto . 
  if we left the eu tomorrow we 'd be number 2 behind the us . 
  it works for everybody else it seems . 
   ** i think the european parliament is very transparent and has already introduced a transparency register for lobbyists , ** catherine , you must know that register is voluntary !, 
  it 's actually a negative . 
  it provides the impression that they 're being monitored , whereas it 's a smokescreen . 
  if they do n't want to sign it , they simply do n't . 
  hello catherine , since may 22nd 2014 you 've been having to fill some pretty big liberal democrat shoes ( and several pairs too - bravo !, 
  ) , being the uk 's sole ld representative . 
  one pair of shoes you 're having to ` fill ' is your colleague and fellow lib dem , andrew duff , president of the union of european federalists and co-founder of the pro-federal advocacy spinelli group . 
  ** do you share his visions and could you expand a little on what the end destination of further eu integration is - as you envision it ? 
  i note you 're not down as one of the meps that has signed the spinelli manifesto yet - is it something you 'd consider supporting ? 
  ** http://www.spinelligroup.eu/sign-manifesto, 
  catherine , you 're known for doing a lot of work around human trafficking . 
  you 're quoted as saying , `` criminal gangs , drug smugglers and human traffickers operate across borders so law enforcement must have tools to cross borders too . '', 
  putting aside that that is in itself an argument for putting a border guard on the border which the eu has taken off , a significant problem with human trafficking in the eu actually lies at a sourcre outside the eu . 
  romania and bulgaria have citizenship laws with moldova and macedonia respectfully . 
  it 's very easy for people from these countries to become romanian and bulgarian citizens . 
  that 's the entry point and criminals are using illegally acquired documentation in moldova and macedonia to acquire official and genuine eu citizenship ( and there 's no real way of the eu checking ) . 
  eu passports are being bought by non-eu citizens and are being issued by eu countries . 
  from there they can travel with impunity and legally so it 's not so much a question of policing ( which is what interpol is for and it expands beyond the eu ) , more you 've lost control of who can acquire eu citizenship from outside . 
  moldova is ranked 15th worst in the world when it comes to slavery and it 's almost one of the most corrupt . 
  the eu has opened up a new market place for them . 
  ** what do you plan to do to fix it ? 
  '' ** specifically in the light of the following bbc article ( feb 2014 ) , thousands of people have been trafficked to the uk and kept in conditions of modern slavery in the past year , according to the latest police figures . 
  statistics released by the national crime agency ( nca ) show the number of potential victims of trafficking last year increased by 22 % on 2012 , rising to 2,744 people from more than 86 countries , of whom 602 were children . 
  the report drew a critical response from andrew wallis , chief executive of anti-trafficking ngo unseen , who said it demonstrated that the uk still did not understand of the scale of the crime .
