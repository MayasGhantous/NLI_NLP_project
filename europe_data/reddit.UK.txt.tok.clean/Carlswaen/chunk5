  but aidan mcquade , director of anti- slavery international , said the increase in the number of reported victims could partly be attributed to a better understanding of the issue by the government and authorities . 
  eastern europe remains a primary source of victims . 
  the highest number of people trafficked into the uk came from romania and most of them were sexually exploited . 
  poland was the most likely country of origin for people facing labour exploitation . 
  of all known victims of labour trafficking , 78 % were european economic area nationals legally working in the uk . 
  #not only how would you fix it , but how will you reconcile this with the fact that the alde 's president has only today in his plenary speech on the turkish summit conceded , `` we have to fix our external borders . 
  our european borders and coastguard , and what i see is we are not capable to do so . '', 
  guy verhofstadt , dec 2nd , 2015 it appears our membership of the eu combined with unfettered access with much poorer countries , porous borders , and existing human trafficking problems is actually driving up demand !,

  but was n't the minaret thing more architectural than fear ? 
  that part of the opposition was they did n't want something designed to dominate the natural skyline . 
  as i understood it , which admittedly i did n't closely follow because it was n't something i concerned myself with , but the mosques beneath the minarets were n't prohibited - so i 'm not sure if ` fear ' came into it . 
  happy to be corrected though . 
  perhaps if they were making things up . 
  problem being even if the media has decided to ` go after him ' then they do n't have to make things up . 
  he 's just too contentious on too many cross party issues like monarchy and defence . 
  they can present his economic policy ` as is ' , and people will understand it 's not rooted in reality . 
  they u-turned on their own key fiscal charter from a position of opposition , days after presenting it at conference . 
  it 's not so much that the media is going after him , it 's that he 's not giving them much to champion . 
  of course the media is going to smack their lips when they smell blood . 
  of course they 're going to report it when a labour mp leaves a meeting calling it a `` total fucking shambles '' . 
  it 's their own mps that have been quoted calling the new labour leadership meetings `` feral '' , `` the worst plp meeting they have ever been to '' , acting like `` a student union president '' , calling each other `` dickheads '' and `` trolls '' . 
  that 's labour mps on other labour mps . 
  of course the media is going to revel in it . 
  this is n't an inoculation process ; it 's full-on galloping lurgi . 
  sweden and denmark have their own currencies so do n't have the issue that scotland had , and finland would have , in launching one . 
  the circumvent to that is pegging to a currency , and if , and it 's a strong if , but if they are willing to marshal spending and taxation according to the needs of a fixed currency - and especially around willing to run a budget surplus - then they can have both a strong currency and a strong economy . 
  it will require strong market liberalisation in the global sense , but when applied it can and does deliver . 
  and that then may facilitate then looking at a more swedish or danish model and floating their own currency in a controlled manner . 
  singapore does quite well and it 's been pegged to the gbp , the usd , a basket-currency system , and the brunei dollar . 
  it certainly recovered/weathered the 2007-2008 crisis better than the eu and its currency has strengthened internationally . 
  http://imgur.com/a/fisoa there 's certainly an argument to be said for iceland pegging a currency to something like the imf 's sdrs and having the best of both worlds , if they have the same fiscal and spending discipline - which i 'm sure they can . 
  that does n't bode well . 
  hobsbawm was a revisionist who himself admitted omitting inconvenient history at inconvenient times . 
  hobsbawm was a propagandist first . 
  do n't be silly , it 's not as if he 'd be left kicking cans in an alleyway . 
  he 'd still have a job only in a different division . 
  hell , if he could save the force a small fortune by saying he did n't need so many resources whilst pulling a bit of a pr coup , he 'd be up for promotion in the future !, 
  there might even be a knighthood in it for him . 
  as it is he 's saying they 're making actual arrests and you seem to be the one `` saying out of thin air '' out of thin air . 
  security forces picked up parviz khan who then admitted plotting a terrorist act , an attack that was prevented , and is now serving a life sentence . 
  so they do work some of the time . 
  operation pitsford was another where 11 suicide bombers around birmingham were arrested before they could put their plan into action . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_plot_to_behead_a_british_muslim_soldier https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_pitsford, 
   it 's time to admit mass spying does n't work , it 's clearly not infallible but according to a [ uk terror police chief : fifty attacks stopped since 7/7 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-33417300 ) it 's not even mass spying , more mass data retention ( which can be bad enough ) , but it 's difficult to say what does and does not work when working means something not happening and our not finding out about it . 
  if there 's merit to the argument that increased powers makes it more difficult for them to operate in that country and as a result less likely to choose it as their target , then i think every government at least has to have the conversation . 
  to be fair , politically , the uk and the eu have become pretty divergent and not representative of each other . 
  the president of the commission and his party 's parliamentary bloc did n't even run in the uk in 2014 . 
  the second largest parliamentary bloc which was represented in the uk actually requested that their bloc president did n't campaign in the uk . 
  the fourth largest eu parliamentary bloc got just 1 uk mep , and that was only because a rogue doppleganger party was allowed on the ballot which took votes from the winning party which meant a single lib dem mep got elected . 
  the winner of the uk european election sits in the ep 's 7th largest group . 
  the two democracies are n't that indicative of each other . 
  it 's real through the looking glass stuff . 
  it 's inevitable people become exasperated and complain about the parliamentary grouping dynamic . 
  it was n't fleeing . 
  it was a rouse . 
  we had them exactly where we wanted them . 
  we could n't well raise birmingham to the ground ourselves could we ? 
  we had to get someone else to do it . 
  and once they 'd done it , we came back . 
  never heard it called that before . 
  in the uk we say john thomas . 
  [ it appears christopher lee was n't having any of that either ... ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/30/article-1224146-0704efa1000005dc-914_468x344.jpg ), 
  not as part of every day interaction with her , no . 
  it 's not like when she pops into greggs the bakers all the staff have to get down on the floor and prostrate themselves . 
  it 's only part of a ceremony of being sworn into the privy council , and even then it 's just a ceremonial option . 
  it 's not mandatory . 
  [ it 's only like kneeling when getting knighted . 
  ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/10_02/ianbothamdm_468x376.jpg ), 
  little bit of ` whooshing ' , but it 's all said in fun . 
  it 's a joke . 
  the maltese are genuinely bad-asses , and we like them for it . 
  who does n't . 
  much as i do n't suspect we can really take french guiana by sneaking ashore and planting a flag . 
  but we can try ... who am i kidding ? 
  of course we were n't going to miss new zealand out . 
  there 's room for you guys too . 
  all equal . 
  high-sea hijnks . 
  nah , you still get visa-free travel for business and tourism for anything between 90 days and 3 months at a time without returning ( such as canadians visiting the eu ) . 
  they 'd have to issue work permits for people wanting to be employed in gib , or residency visas for people wanting to move there permanently but those foreign nationals already there would be covered by the vienna convention on the law treaties . 
  with regards to work permits you only have to look at how the majority of foreign nationals working for the nhs currently come from outside the eu , so we have precedent and systems in place to make it work . 
  anybody with a passport will be fine , and it 's not as though the current daily queues getting in mean a huge detriment to showing a passport . 
  you could require they have to show documentation or an id and sing the entire major-general 's song from the pirates of penzance and they 'd still get in quicker . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_canadian_citizens https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_convention_on_the_law_of_treaties https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major-general%27s_song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyzm__vdejk, 
  do n't forget about the two weeks of summer when we all complain about it being too hot and the beer-wasps . 
  genuinely do n't mind . 
  lot of love for malta . 
  historically , plucky little bastards , in the nicest , affectionate sense of the term . 
  i still maintain that when we leave the eu malta is coming with us . 
  as independents and equals of course , but no man left behind . 
  i 've not informed their government yet but i figured we 'd offer to pay off malta 's debt ( what 's another # 5bn to us ) and whatever it costs to drop that ghastly currency they 've been using as of late ( we 'll have a whip ` round ) . 
  then head on over to south america and give french guiana back to the portuguese for old time 's sake , because as our oldest allies they 've got to come along with us too . 
  would n't be the same otherwise . 
  do it old school ; sneak ashore and plant a portuguese flag . 
  have a photo posted on facebook to make it official . 
  it 'll be like having an orgy at the rnib . 
  they 'll never see us coming . 
  then kickback with a few bahama mamas in nassau and watch the sunset before deciding what we do tomorrow .
