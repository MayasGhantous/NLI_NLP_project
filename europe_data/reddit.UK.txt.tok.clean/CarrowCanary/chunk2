  we have pink lemonade . 
  want some ? 
  unless that person 's in the back seat , and crushes the person in front of them because they turn into a human-projectile when the car hits something . 
  https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights/entitlement a fair chunk of that can be taken up by things like christmas , new year , easter , etc , though . 
  a lot of places will say `` yeah , you can have the 25th and 26th december off , and the 1st of january , but if you want any days in between , that 's coming out of your holiday allowance '' . 
  if you 're too cold , you can just put more clothes on . 
  too hot ... not much you can do once you 're wearing just your pants and you 're still sweating like jill dando trying to unlock her front door . 
  probably paid time off . 
  do n't know where they 're from ( no flair ) , but here in the uk you 're allowed the equivalent of 5.6 * paid weeks off work . 
  * working a 5 day week is 28 days off per year , 6 day working week would be 34 days . 
  again ? 
  france ( 640k km ^ 2 ) is more than twice the size of the uk ( 244k km ^ 2 ) geographically , and france 's population is only 2 million people higher ( 64m and 66m ) . 
  they 've got a fuck-load more space to put them than we have . 
  being maltese . 
  the lighter way to enjoy living on an island . 
  interesting , is the same in both languages . 
  [ a dutch bloke ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornelius_vermuyden ) is the reason a fairly sizeable chunk of the uk is n't underwater already . 
  bit thin for my tastes . 
  goodfellas all the way for me . 
  lea and perrins on top 's where it 's at . 
  you get fawlty towers in estonia ? 
   pheasant shooting is a common pursuit for the rich you do n't have to be rich , you just have to know where to go ( and have permission from whoever owns the land , obviously ) . 
  for me , flooding would be top ( so climate change ? 
  ) , and maybe the rising prices/cost of living as my other choice . 
  terrorism , there 's no point worrying . 
  the odds of anything happening to you specifically is minuscule , and of it happening to someone you , still tiny . 
  there 's nothing you can really do anyway , attacks are very much a case of `` wrong time , wrong place '' if you get caught in one . 
  immigration : i 'd say it comes under either the unemployment category ( pretty much everything in the media is `` they 're stealing our jobs '' * ) or the terrorism category ( all the immigrants are muslims who will want to kill us ) , both of which are bollocks . 
  not to mention that a lot of the people who complain about immigration would have no hesitation fucking off to live in the costa del sol if they had the chance . 
  * it really is baffling how many people will argue that `` they 're stealing our jobs '' in one breath , and then go off on a rant about how `` they 're only here for the benefits , and do n't want to work '' . 
  motorways added ? 
  you a lorry driver or something ? 
  who 's the football team , steaua bucharest ? 
  we have a similar problem because of edl/bnp wankers . 
  put it up anyway , do n't let a few morons steal your national identity . 
  last one i remember happening for us is [ this one ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/19/raf-scrambles-jets-after-russian-bombers-spotted-near-cornwall-coast ) . 
  some random woman says one [ was actually over cornwall ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/19/russian-bomber-flew-inland-cornwall-uk-airspace-witness ) , but the odds of it being true are absolutely minuscule . 
  [ here ] ( http://aviationhumor.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/stealth-fighter-in-static-show.jpg ) 's one of them parked . 
  hitting one building and shooting a few people is one thing , having a city-wide coordinated attack with explosives over several locations is a hell of a lot harder to pull off . 
  we ( obviously , people with direct ties to the victims are excluded ) pretty much recovered from 7/7 on the 8th . 
  a lot of people thought things like `` it wo n't happen here again , it was the wake-up call we needed '' , and we just got on with things . 
  from what i saw , people were actually a little more shaken after the bombs ( that did n't go off ) were found on the 29th , because `` well , that 's two now in less than three weeks , when 's the next one going to happen '' was in the back of people 's minds . 
  frankly , it 's sickening just how many people see the words muslim , refugee , or immigrant , and immediately translate it in their head to terrorist . 
   schools are closed this saturday in paris french schools are usually open on saturdays ? 
   i fear what will happen to the good innocent muslims of france . 
  they 'll get attacked by some misguided idiots , which will then probably encourage a few of the innocent muslims that maybe the extremists are right after all . 
  it 's the cycle that never ends due to intolerance on both sides . 
  not sure about only to planes , but it certainly only applies to the japanese , it translates as divine wind . 
  blame every member of a religion for the actions of a tiny minority of mentalists ? 
  sure , that makes sense . 
  it 's the same as blaming every single irish person for ira bombings : totally ridiculous . 
  found [ this ] ( https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.liberation.fr/evenement/2005/09/21/un-paris-ecarlate-en-cas-d-attaques_533008&amp;prev=search ) about the `` plan attentats multiples ''  there is already red plan for firefighters that the prefect triggers the eight departments in the region , and zonal operations center ( coz ) , which coordinates relief . 
  there will now be a `` plan multiple attacks '' or `` scarlet '' to combine emergency interventions , transport , public security and judicial police investigators . 
   if one day an attack occurs somewhere on the rail network or metropolitan area of paris , `` we can expect another explosion elsewhere , and thus we apply the precautionary principle is evacuated all passengers trains and subways , at the very least 500,000 parisians who use public transport at a time of high transhumance in the morning or evening , `` says a senior official . 
  in short , while they 're hunting the guys that did it , they 're also evacuating all the public transport in case there are plans to hit those , too . 
  every crime 's a local crime to someone , so by that logic they should remove pretty much everything . 
  do n't blame it on the flanker do n't blame it on the raptor do n't blame it on the falcon blame it on the boogie, 
  what ? 
  where have you seen a house over here that does n't have a fusebox ?

  great on pasta , too . 
   daily mail is also the only paper with a majority female readership . 
  why is that relevant ? 
  it 's not like one gender massively voted one way and the other voted the opposite , the [ ashcroft poll ] ( http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/ ) came out at exactly 50/50 , and most others are either the same or 49/51 . 
  no , i 'm saying that it 's both ways round , it goes in a loop : conservative people see a headline that they agree with , so they buy the paper . 
  the paper prints those stories and headlines because it appeals to conservatives . 
  the readers get spoonfed stories they believe because of their views/opinions , and the newspapers keep printing the same kind of stories because it 's what their readers want to read . 
   ahh the classic , people only voted to leave because of the media , nothing to do with personal views . 
  well , some of them also voted leave because they 're racist , so i suppose that comes under personal views . 
   old people are only socially conservative because they read the sun or the daily mail , not the other way around ? 
  you think those newspapers do n't publish stories that pander to the views of their readers ? 
  people buy the papers that appeal to their opinions , and then end up having their thoughts confirmed by the stories in them . 
  most of the inaccurate stories are from the daily mail ( with probably a sizeable chunk of the rest being from the likes of the sun ) . 
  old people read the daily mail , lower-class ( and poorly-educated ) people read the sun . 
  guess which demographics voted heavily in favour of brexit . 
   it often gets lost that there is a sizeable , nearly half , of the populace who certainly did not vote for this . 
  it 's worse than that . 
  we 're a 60m + population , only 17m voted to leave . 
  over 70 % of the population did n't vote for brexit . 
  her parents are both english . 
  ok , let 's do this . 
  i 'll start with emma watson . 
  who 's your mexican counter-point ? 
  what ? 
  no he 's not , most of us think he 's a total bell-end . 
  is that to replace the famas ? 
   do stereotypes only become inaccurate when they are negative and derogatory ? 
  all stereotypes are inaccurate . 
  if they were true , they 'd just be called facts . 
  or gibraltar . 
  innocent until proven guilty . 
  the names will be put in the press when they 've been charged and prosecuted . 
  those tesco horse burgers were fantastic . 
  we 're going to survive on marmite on toast , cornish pasties , and cottage pie . 
  turkey are now considering a referendum on whether to [ stop trying to get in ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/erdogan-considers-turkey-referendum-on-whether-to-give-up-on-sta/ ) . 
  except for east anglia . 
  most of the natives around there will refuse to work on the farms and in the factories for minimum wage , so they have no choice but to hire foreigners . 
  but apparently this is the fault of the immigrant workers . 
  wonder how many of bakkavor 's factories ( [ link to map ] ( http://www.bakkavor.com/where-we-operate.aspx ) , click the uk to see where they are ) will now pack up and move to the mainland . 
  ah , english ( simplified ) .
