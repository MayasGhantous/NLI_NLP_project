yeah i can tell that you 're not german since if you were you would know that it was reported very widely . 
  let 's see , what do these countries have in common ... 
   russia  voting pick one, 
  i am british if you did n't notice . 
  you confirm my suspicions over and over again . 
  thanks for not `` bothering with [ me ] '' again . 
  spares me the time of having to read your shit . 
  you 're the reason people around the world think our nation is filled with imbeciles . 
  that 's what you interpreted , not what i said . 
  it was clear that i referred to educating yourself on the matter because you seem to be ignorant about the whole thing . 
  i get the feeling though that your interpretation might be more accurate ( ** that ** was a personal insult in case you ca n't tell ) . 
  you 'd benefit from looking up what `` insult '' means . 
  personal insult ? 
  me voting him in ? 
  seriously you need to think before writing mate . 
  so all the crying about the `` unelected eurocrats '' and now you complain that someone that was ** elected ** is in the european parliament ? 
  and btw , he has a principle he is trying to push through , which is to show what 's wrong with the eu and providing a party people can vote for in protest . 
  how about educating yourself first before spouting something ? 
  except that the opposite is the case . 
  that is a tax incentive . 
  the thing is if it 's storing the data . 
  in germany it 's illegal to store the illegal data . 
  streaming technically stores it but only as a buffer so you ca n't access it outside of this stream . 
  downloading it is technically not illegal , only storing is so the question is if it really is storing or not . 
  i 'm not a lawyer but that is my understanding of it . 
  a vpn is also a great way to circumvent regional restrictions ( bar some exceptions like netflix ) . 
  they are very cheap as well so it 's not only a good idea for pirating but for other stuff as well . 
  use a vpn . 
  if you have a good one you should n't be worried . 
  it 's part of the definition of pirating . 
  even paid ones do n't work with netflix ( at least the ones i tried ) . 
  it 's not legal but also not illegal . 
  it 's a grey area in german law . 
  and here we see a prime example of a chav with zero education . 
  i did n't know that being british in britain is foreign . 
   i agree and i 've said it before , it was a mistake to allow germany to exist after they themselves tried to eradicate the identity of their neighbouring countries . 
  so britons are allowed to do that but germans are n't . 
  fucking hypocritical cunt . 
  i wo n't even begin to argue why that is fucking retarded . 
  what makes it worse is that you are spanish and still write shit like that . 
  not being able to do business in the eu = killing oneself good to know . 
   would n't give up the eu  pull out of those countries before allowing that to happen choose one . 
  and your analogy is outright wrong . 
  if they want to do business in the eu they have to abide by their rules . 
  survive sure but i doubt they 'd be willing to just give up the other part . 
  no matter how easy it is , the majority wo n't bother . 
  they will just use another service . 
  nice anology . 
  except for the fact that it 's not even close to being comparable . 
  the majority wo n't however . 
  they ca n't use it ? 
  that would n't be possible were they to really pull out of the eu . 
  i mean 30-40 % of their overall revenue not just eu revenue . 
  the eu market is huge . 
  and lose 30-40 % of their revenue . 
  good idea . 
  area of land does n't really matter when talking about seaports . 
  how much they handle does . 
  what does area of land matter though ? 
  when i think of ` biggest seaport ' i think of how much they handle . 
  it 's the third largest seaport in europe . 
  why the tracksuit ? 
  maybe older people . 
  younger people do n't ( at least not in my experience ) . 
   the st patrick 's cross looks like it is the correct way up it 's not since it should be lower where the mast is and in this case the white part that gets fastened to the mast is on the right . 
  the st patricks cross should be lower on the side where it 's fastened to the mast ( the white stuff on the right ) . 
  it is upside down . 
  it 's also incorrect from the other side . 
  first sentence is more like ` who speaks oxford english anyway ? ', 
  and also important is the ` from their ( brussels ) point of view ' in regards to the mistake . 
  why are you so angry ? 
  i reckon you 've never been to glasgow . 
  are you expecting erdogan voters to think ? 
  his top gear character is only xenophobic if you take everything he says at face value and not as the joke that it is . 
  it 's humour . 
  he also made jokes about lorry drivers for example and i doubt he hates all lorry drivers . 
  if you do n't find it funny that 's okay but saying that it 's just racism or xenophobia is a bit ridiculous . 
  just my opinion though . 
  in my opinion the only people who think he is xenophobic read way too much into his jokes . 
  you have a source on that ? 
  why was london ( largest percentage of foreign born residents ) remain then ? 
  i think you might be projecting there quite hard . 
  do you enjoy mindlessly spouting nonsense or why do you do it ? 
  you have a weird definition of being ` corrected ' . 
  you did n't correct anyone . 
  you just wrote some quote without even giving any kind of validation . 
  i guess that means that you can not provide a source then . 
  figures . 
  stop making a fool of yourself mate . 
  you look like a total loony . 
  it 's embarrassing . 
  you did n't even provide a source for your quote . 
  `` the irish government receives a special snowflake status and can do everything it wants . '', 
  see i can quote too . 
  i suggest you do a little research . 
  the treaty was amended not just the irish constitution . 
  you mean they had a referendum on the amended version of it . 
  i think it 's pretty funny that we are always accused of wrongly blaming the eu while people like you always blame others as well . 
  that 's french . 
  judging by their gdp and hdi i 'd say they 're doing alright by themselves .
