  that they are concerned about their privacy ? 
  seriously you need to get your head out of your arse . 
  firstly this is austria we are talking about and secondly you evidently do n't know anything about german politics . 
  why is it that you feel the need to bash germany at every opportunity ? 
  then they should vote for someone who says he is going to scrap the laws necessary . 
  you know like everything in a democracy . 
  oh yeah the thousands of soldiers just took a holiday there with their guns and tanks in their luggage . 
  and ? 
  the authorities do n't need the service . 
  if a private company wants to offer them they need to pay for it themselves and comply with the law . 
  why should the government pay a private company for something they do n't want or need ? 
  the austrian government did n't ask google to implement street view in their country , it 's the other way around . 
  yeah russia invaded ukraine because the us provoked it to do so . 
  keep telling yourself that mate . 
  your argument would make sense if the government of austria requested to have street view in their country and not the other way around . 
  if google does n't comply with the laws they wo n't be able to offer street view in austria it 's that simple . 
  austria should n't pay them anything . 
  i 'm not sure whether you read his comment . 
  he never said it 's a bad thing and never even touches on the subject of us military spending or its obligation to defend the eu . 
   wage gap it was proven numerous times that it does not exist . 
  if you adjust for occupation and hours worked it disappears . 
  do n't come to britain if you think you have it bad . 
  you ca n't really poll something like this in any accurate way . 
  how the population think it would react and how it would actually react are two very different things . 
  toyota land cruiser range rover nissan xterra jeep wrangler just to name a few . 
  because that is the only suv there is . 
  a warning label is not censoring . 
  and evidently a lot of people do need it . 
  in theory a third party candidate can also become president . 
  in reality though that is simply not going to happen . 
  it 's the game of shitty democracy . 
  it 's not representative at all because of the electoral college . 
  given that they voted democrats and the actual government is republican i 'd argue that they do n't . 
  californians have extremely little power compared to their size . 
  california does not have voting power over mississippi . 
  on a per capita basis it has less power . 
  there is no civilised argument to be made with buffoons like you so i ca n't be arsed . 
  keep on hating on germany and europe and wallow in your inferiority complex . 
  yeah countries like norway , sweden or switzerland have been so unstable and poor . 
  if only they adopted the us 's electoral system . 
  you 're an oaf . 
  one merely has to look at your comment history to see what a sad piece of work you are . 
  he says ` could n't have happened to a nicer country ' . 
  the ppp means it was adjusted for purchasing power . 
  and once again you are diverting from the argument you 've made . 
  i wo n't try to argue with you further since your tactic clearly is changing the subject once you realise that you are wrong and hope that nobody notices it . 
  ** the original topic was whether the larger economy is hostile to ireland 's tax arrangements ** . 
  nothing else . 
  i wo n't waste my breath any further arguing with such a blithering oaf . 
  revenue for ireland without being in the eu with these tax arrangements : 0 revenue for ireland within the eu : 100 revenue for ireland within the eu with the altered tax arrangements : 50 what is better for ireland the 0 or the 50 ? 
  and this is an ** analogy ** . 
  maybe you should really think about what you write before spouting uninformed and misguided nonsense . 
  if ireland were n't in the eu , the companies would leave to settle in an eu country . 
  they would n't pay anything in ireland ( or rather only the tax on the profits from within ireland , a marginal part of the entire eu ) . 
  see , you 're doing it again . 
  stop changing the subject . 
  exactly . 
  and you 're trying to change the subject . 
  fact is that ** the larger economy is not hostile to ireland 's tax arrangements ** . 
  do you even read what i write ? 
  you 're just spouting out unrelated snippets and do n't address what i wrote in the slightest . 
  you said the larger economy is hostile to ireland 's tax arrangements , while in actuality the opposite is the case . 
  it 's the reason ireland can even make these tax arrangements in the first place . 
  additionally they 'd be stupid to stick to the uk , even in the short term , in anything other than border control as to prevent something like the troubles . 
  that means that the big economy is beneficial for ireland 's tax arrangements , not detrimental . 
  the only reason it works is that ** it is ** a big economy . 
   the larger economy is hostile to ireland 's tax arrangements you did . 
  the only reason the companies are based in ireland is because it 's in the eu . 
  18 % is basically the entire economy ? 
  and by the way , north rhine-westphalia has a bigger economy . 
  yes i did n't claim otherwise . 
  added a little bit of extra information . 
  oxford prefers the ` z ' over the 's ' . 
  britons have used ` z ' like that since at least 1425 ( [ source ] ( http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/03/ize-or-ise/ ) ) . 
  stop reading the daily mail . 
  then he should express himself properly . 
  except that you 're not . 
  germany is . 
  net contribution is not about per capita/as a percentage of gdp or whatever . 
  the title is not correct . 
  the largest net contributor is the one who pays the most . 
  not per capita/relative to gdp or whatever . 
  that 's like saying the netherlands are the largest exporters in the world and basing that on a statistic of clog exports . 
  no , you were saying germans are ` too proud of themselves ' ( sic ) to abandon their language and switch to english . 
  that 's not the same as saying that there is a language barrier or that many people do n't want to learn german . 
   too proud of themselves to adopt the international language , english a + analysis right there . 
  it could n't possibly be that most people would prefer to watch tv and speak with their countrymen in their native language . 
  this subreddit is literally called ` europe ' . 
  did you look at what this thread is about ? 
   amazon tracking number never seen that . 
  it 's 90 % dhl . 
  if you go by mass of citizens i agree that the us probably has 80 % of it alone . 
  the only police officers i 've seen who were having weight problems were american . 
  that 's not ` quite a lot of countries ' . 
  the_donald poster calling others ` euro `` sobs '' ' . 
  https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american the main definitions are relating to the us . 
  i will still trust ** any ** professor more than some random redditor unless that redditor can back up his claims with credible sources ( which this guy can not ) . 
  i did n't know gdp growth statistics nowadays show the reason the gdp grew the way it did !, 
  those are some awesome statistics . 
  oh wait , they do n't , you are just citing unrelated stuff and extrapolate facts from data that does n't allow those extrapolations in the first place .
