  professor vs random redditor . 
  which one is more trustworthy i wonder ... do you even speak german and understand their articles ? 
  as if they 'd care about those studies . 
  that 's not how cherry picking works . 
  you were just called out and act defensive now because you can not admit any wrongdoing . 
  nice , you admitted to cherry picking in order to make things fit your narrative . 
  you equate minimum wage with average wage . 
  minimum wage in norway , sweden , denmark , and switzerland is 0 euro . 
  are wages in bulgaria infinitely more than in those countries ? 
  wrong order for the belgian flag . 
  the entire point of the article is that money ** is ** an object . 
  those statistics are basically just what uni 's research gets cited more . 
  obviously the english papers will get more citations than french , german etc. 
  another thing that factors in is the percentage of foreign students/staff agin favouring english speaking countries . 
  there are no reliable ways to rank universities . 
  some other rankings have more eu universities on it , some have less . 
  it 's not objective . 
   every ratailer sure . 
  did you read my post ? 
  evidently not . 
  those are retailers . 
  they operate on the principle of demand . 
  if the product does n't sell they will replace it with something that will . 
  so the only products available are those of german companies ? 
  oh the irony !, 
  you 're just a sad brexiteer who can not handle anything that goes against your narrative . 
  congratulations , you repeated what he said . 
  source ? 
   i get prison when i murder someone ? 
  you are blackmailing me !!!, 
  you , by that logic . 
  g9 is called that because you are in the ` gymnasium ' for 9 years ( grade 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 ) . 
  with g8 you are only there for 8, 
  i doubt that . 
  what if they do n't agree on a sum ? 
  never pay it ? 
  if that 's the case it 's not a fine but a suggestion . 
  seems like you are arguing for my case . 
  there was no negligence found in the uk thus they won the lawsuit . 
  does n't have anything to do with how many lawyers they had . 
  is there a law that does n't allow the drinks to be over 90c ? 
  if not then that 's not because they had lawyers but because it 's regulation . 
  you can argue that it was too hot but then it needs to be a law . 
  also i read up on that case and it 's more than just lawyers . 
  the evidence was simply too unsubstantial or outright not there to support the lawsuit . 
  as you pointed out  the judge also expressly criticised the quality of the claimants ' expert witnesses for being unprofessional and not providing enough evidence . 
  so it was n't because mcd had more lawyers but because they did n't do wrong . 
  no it 's not . 
  you just think that way . 
  show me an example . 
  yeah we would n't fine them but the eu still would . 
  and by ` access ' everyone knows one is referring to being in the single market or the eea . 
  by that logic they could stay in the us too . 
  no need to set up an office anywhere on earth besides their headquarters . 
   deutsche bank announced a new london hq on the day of the brexit result . 
  they 've also announced they 're going to buy london office buildings for $ 395 million quoting `` despite brexit , london is and remains one of the most attractive locations for real estate investments in europe , '' so they do n't move to london . 
  just build an office there . 
  and what companies would that be that have an office in london but not anywhere in the eu ? 
  fines do n't work that way . 
  they do n't negotiate . 
  it does n't though . 
  one example is the case a lot of people make fun of with mcdonald 's being sued over the temperature of the coffee ( which was legitimately wrongdoing on their part , a fact a lot of people seem to miss ) . 
  all their lawyers did n't get them squat . 
   course it matters whenever banks move from london it 's a circle jerk on the front page of / r/europe they move out of london because they can not serve the eu market from london . 
  that 's also the reason it would be useless to establish a london office for google . 
  i 've yet to hear from any banks moving ** to ** london after brexit . 
  your comparisons do n't make any sense . 
  the reason it does n't matter is because they can also fine them without them actually having an office in the eu . 
   britain will get access from the deal . 
  if the government accept freedom of movement , pay the eu etc yes , otherwise no . 
   just do what the tax dodging companies do in ireland and set up small subsidiaries in eu countries for access . 
  your whole point of them moving to london was to evade these fines . 
  you are rendering your own argument moot . 
  besides , how did that pan out for apple ? 
  does n't matter where the headquarters are . 
  besides , the headquarters are in california anyway . 
  london wo n't be in the eu soon . 
  if they needed a base of operations for the eu they 'd not establish one there . 
  the one in london could only serve the uk market . 
  you can not solve everything with lawyers . 
  why do so many people think all you have to do is hire enough lawyers and you will get away with anything . 
  point is there is no british standard and a lot of british people also use the ` z ' version . 
  oxford dictionary prefers the ` z ' . 
  it originates in britain as well , it 's not an american spelling . 
  in fact it was used before the spelling with 's ', 
  why are you so angry , mate ? 
  did your supreme leader donald tell you to talk shit in his behalf ? 
  it 's just some mocked-up flags , mate . 
  why are you so upset ? 
  france is technically also french . 
  france is technically also french . 
  no they are like a gang that does n't give you # 1 mil when you leave , but instead just lets you leave . 
  you want to have the benefits of something you contribute nothing towards . 
  your post was irrelevant and a blatant attempt to vilify germans for stuff that their ancestors did . 
  you are just butthurt that nobody else is as big of a bigot as you are . 
  nope , you and him are just twats . 
  nobody is butthurt ( except you probably as it seems ) . 
  as proud as you seem to be about being a dickwad . 
  hint : nobody is downvoting you because you posted a historic fact or something , but because you are just inconsiderate and generally abhorent . 
  britain is referring to great britain ( or colloquially also the uk ) .
