  you seem to think that every person in europe is guilty of the crimes their ancestors committed . 
  i wonder how you would fair if we held you to the same account ? 
  i , for one , am sick of the passive meat eaters giving me cancer . 
  they even get to go for meat breaks !, 
  those scientists and farmers are going to be wasting a lot of time doing menial tasks cooking , cleaning , making their own clothes etc. 
  we * need * people to do the menial jobs, 
  i like the lead theory, 
  i quite like my our little brand of civic nationalism, 
  yeah , but why should * i * have to face a one child policy , when where i live is n't overpopulated , solely because asia is so overpopulated ? 
  on the bright side ... 
  it 's your cake day ? 
  so you 've got that going for you ... 
  ... i do want to know who you think will be fighting though, 
   yeah , i 'll start a campain for women to stop shaving their armpits , legs and intimate area . 
   you 'll change your opinion very fast . 
  ya think ? 
  all xtc is fantastic these days . 
  for a guy who claims to be not racist , you have a lot of racist comments  this town is a shit hole . 
  checks black population level . 
  yep , makes sense . 
  also :  lol that 's why i have a degree in technology / r/iamverysmart - a degree in * technology * which technology ? 
  i 've never heard of a technology degree :|, 
  mirror ? 
  yeah , but generally we do n't want to leave the eu, 
  ... do n't lump us all together :|, 
  still too much of a risk . 
  we know that there are special forces and training crews in iraq, 
  russia wo n't touch iraq , far too many american personell in the area, 
   for some reason that my third world brain ca n't process thousands of europeans are moving there it 's cheap and sunny :d, 
  it was in jest of course , but you see the point i 'm making . 
  i just assumed you went to florida in my ridiculous example , but you see what i mean ? 
  you could 've easily went to many much poorer countries , but chose the richest in the world, 
  i mean . . i get what you 're saying . 
  but you passed cuba , jamaica and the bahamas before you got to america . 
  why did n't you stop at them ? 
  because that 's the same idea as not stopping in the poorer european countries, 
  you n ' me both buddy, 
  1 ) we like to mock americans because you 're so loud and happy ( it 's not natural ! ), 
  but it 's never serious 2 ) my childhood friend moved to upstate new york ( middle of nowhere afaik ) and loves it 3 ) yes , you 're not irish or scottish at all because your great great great great grand father lived there 4 ) glasgow , because i was first to reply to you, 
  heh , made me laugh, 
  in the uk we call these private hires ; and they still have to register as a taxi ( although it 's a different type of registration ), 
   what makes military-aged males from syria better carers than people in the uk i never said they will , i said that the current batch of carers in the private sector are bad , unmotivated and working for the minimum wage . 
  would a syrian be better ? 
  i dunno , maybe  ok , so then there will be more unemployed people . 
  what will these brand new british people do for work ? 
  what are you dribbling about ? 
  if you think that care work should be minimum wage then you do n't understand the industry at all . 
  by not being the shitty carers that work there just now ? 
  and the whole point i was making is that it * should n't * be a minimum wage job, 
   i 'm an immigrant and i live in the u.s.a. 
  i came to this country in 1985 from the dominican republic , legally and i was not an economic migrant i do n't want to take away from your post at all because it was really good . 
  but if you move from a poor country to a rich country ; then you 're an economic migrant . 
  in 1985 there was no war ( as far as i know ) in the domincan republic, 
  because there was quite a big fuss made about this incident ; a large portion of social media ( and even reddit ) claiming it was a muslim extremists who beheaded someone . 
  clearing up that it was infact nothing to do with islam is what i 'd expect a report to do, 
  and yet in that example it was n't migrants who were bad carers \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  america will always defend a nato ally . 
  if they do n't then nato falls apart and with it a large part of america 's defence programmes, 
  if a refugee from a war zone with no skills who ca n't speak the language manages to replace you it might not be the refugees fault, 
  yeah , he must be confusing migrants and refugees, 
  that would be ironic, 
  i would n't disagree with that , but the statement i replied to was in regards to military spending . 
  but if russia and the allies went to war during ww2 you would need to amp that number up * exponentially * just in poland alone , and then do the same for every other country in europe, 
   the eu defense spending just isnt there to be a credible deterrent europe is * only * outspent on it 's military by the us, 
  * tips foederis *, 
  true . 
  but the team behind him ? 
  proper nuts , evangelical climate denying types . 
  the worst types of us politican imo, 
  it does often feel like the us election system is designed to help the republican states in the middle of the country, 
  in the uk parliament yes , in the scottish parliament no, 
  i 'd be shocked if they do n't fall in line pretty quickly . 
  he 's got public backing , anyone who he calls out in public can kiss their career goodbye, 
  what i think is crazy is that someone who denies climate change can even be in contention for the white house . 
  depends imo . 
  if he comes in and it 's business as usual ( which is what i suspect ) then nothing has really changed if he builds a wall and deports 12 million people while blaming global warming on china and dropping nukes on isis ? ... 
  could be a minor fuck up, 
   for the first time since 1984 and 1988 surely they 're not ? 
  yep , they got a security resolution - every world power was on board . 
  iraq is the example he should 've used, 
  russia are n't steamroller across europe , and nobody is launching icbm 's, 
   please consider me as uneducated , and stupid as you must - but why the fuck is no-one putting a bullet through his head ? 
  that 's not the un 's job . 
  the un 's job is to * prevent * ww3 by allowing a channel for dialogue between two parties, 
  could you try & explain their mindset to an outsider ? 
  seems crazy considering history, 
  victoria ? 
  churchill !,
