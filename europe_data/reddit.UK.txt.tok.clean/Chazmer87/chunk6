  we do n't like them , but we 're not trying to take them down . 
  if we can take down an organised nation state then we can destroy a pseudo caliphate . 
  there 's just no public appetite for another war in the middle east, 
  yep , we 're going to turkey in may and would have changed it if it was n't so bloody expensive, 
  really ? 
  name one military ally ( by treaty ) they have axed ? 
  the us sticks by its allies even when it probably should n't, 
  there 's an argument that europe was far ahead of all the large empires in the high middle ages because it had lots of small countries competition with each other rather than being part of a large empire . 
  this could still hold true . 
   as for scotland , who cares ? 
  every time something does n't go their way they have a fit . 
  they 'll get over it . 
  not really true though , is it ? 
  and this attitude is what drove the independence movement from the start, 
  yeah , but it was an aristocracy not a democracy , not exactly the same thing . 
  did i hit a nerve ? 
  nobody wants to be ruled by a dictator . 
  italy was extremely violent during its time with a dictator too, 
   some countries are just better off with dictators like italy ? 
  moscow has always been in europe . 
  the majority of the russian population lives in europe , with only a small section living in the asian areas, 
  jeeeez , at least it was other children an not you !, 
  i 've really liked extra history 's series on justinian - worth a watch !, 
   here in the uk we rarely release psychopath child killers . 
  we * have * released a couple though, 
  it 's weird, 
   but because of the way london is with all the money funnelled through , it looks like everyone there is super rich no ? 
  there are some obscenely wealthy people in london . 
  but if you look at the correct statistics it gives you a fair representation of the city ... look what you 've got me doing , me * a scot * defending london , bah !, 
   so why were n't nazis jewish-skeptics ? 
  that 's a serious question . 
  because they were part of an organised political party ( and then state ? ), 
   drink way beyond their limit . 
  there 's a limit ? 
  why the fuck would nobody tell us ? 
  what we need first ( imo ) is a shipyard in space . 
  building things under the influence of gravity and then launching them into space is terribly difficult . 
  if we could just build ships there then we could make it as big as we want, 
  the sad fact is , it 's simply not profitable yet, 
  i 'm still trying to figure out why there 's so many homeless guys from glasgow . 
  what are they doing to my countrymen down there ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myqy5yeld0 ), 
  seems you need to do a bit of research on how debt works , and how currency works . 
  if they all decided to sell at once they would never get a billion dollars because no buyer could procure it . 
  you can say the same about cash . 
  if you tried to dump billions of pounds of gbp on the market , the value of the pound would drop - that 's just supply and demand , and that 's taken into account with the price ( and right now demand waaaay outstrips supply in london )  alot of the uk and ireland funnels its stuff through london in terms of fiscal and government shit where as each of the 4 biggest german cities are similar size , the uk has none of this outside london . 
  no cities in germany come close to london - and if you include the greater london area the 4 biggest cities in germany added together do n't compare with it, 
  did i say i wanted them to leave ? 
  but the argument about borders is the one most people in the out camp have, 
   i speak languages ,  edit : exist \u2192 exit ... made me laugh, 
  any eu national can come live in britain, 
  to be fair , i heard about this on a local radio station for the west of scotland this morning, 
  that does n't seem to ring true . 
  my grandparents generation spit a lot and when i asked he said `` the shit used to build up in your throat and nose from the factories , so you spit it out '' it 's possibly something which came with the industrial revolution . 
  either way , in britain at least spitting has been a thing since long before large number of immigrants arrived, 
  killing innocent people is tough for most men, 
  yes , but those techniques do n't secure borders ( or at the very least have n't been shown to ) . 
  only lethal force can secure a border, 
  it was n't the wall - it was the guns . 
  and no european army in it 's right mind will gun down civilians trying to cross a border, 
  those are liquid assets and * should * be in usd . 
  i think you underestimate just how much 10 trillion dollars is, 
  that 's not quite true . 
  saudi armco is reported to hold almost 10 trillion dollars in liquid assets - enough to keep the country chugging along as it currently is for the foreseeable future, 
   right , lets take the easy solution and just enforce compulsory birth control on 7 billion people . 
  why didnt we think of this earlier . 
  ... i 've got my eye on you germany,

  well , there is the [ glasgow effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glasgow_effect ), 
   option 4 : scotland is kicked entirely out of the eu . 
  uk nukes scotland using tridant . 
  aherm ... those lads from greenock have got issues with that, 
  scottish fisherman do n't fuck about . 
  if there was `` illegal fleets '' operating in their waters they would deal with it themselves, 
  yes , but one of the promises made to people who voted no was being part of the eu . 
  scotland was told `` an independent scotland would have to reapply for the eu , which could take years - and spain would likely block our entry due to their catalan debate '' i can see both sides of the argument . 
  and both sides have merit - but tbfh , i 'll still be shocked if the uk votes to leave, 
  genesis 2:15 `` the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to work it and keep it . '', 
  to be fair to obama though , we criticize politicians who 're too scared to change their mind . 
  well ... 
  it 's quite a bit higher due to the proximity and now the kurds but my mrs does n't feel safe to go , and initially i was cool , but after tunisia ... 
  i dunno man , this could be the first year we do n't go, 
  i said a bit , no example would be identical, 
  no , what i mean is ... has the bbc * ever * showed pictures of mohammed ? 
  mine was first  , <, 
  really * really * wish i did n't book to turkey in summer now . 
  wonder if travel will be banned, 
  you mean during the reign of terror ? 
  let 's be honest ... glasgow does n't really need it, 
  these past 2 months have made me feel a lot less like going to turkey this summer :( ... it 's booked though , so fuck wasting money, 
  yes , from one perspective all of your examples were terrorism remember , one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter, 
  i think the lesson here is that in general , people can understand and sympathise with nationalism although your third example is n't exactly true , is it ? 
  turkey ( the ottomans ) used to control large parts of what is now bulgaria . 
  it 's a bit like the same situations with you and russia ... 
  i imagine a bunch of guys getting together in the summer , stealing our gold , stealing our women and then surrounding a city until it gave them more gold ... was i lied to ? 
  syria is not gone as a state . 
  the vast majority of the population live on the coast and are still under government control,
