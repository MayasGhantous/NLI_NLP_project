brit here . 
  the only good thing about those pathetic shitholes is that they are a magnet for the slack-jawed idiots who are so fond of them , so they are easy to avoid . 
  they embarrass me to be honest , but those kind of places are equally pathetic and embarrassing back here in the uk . 
  but it ai n't pretty . 
  well , i own a whip ... 
  i like europe ; i think the eu is broadly a good thing ; i do n't have a problem with immigration , federalism , or republicanism ; i 'm planning to learn a couple of forrin languages . 
  but i still have imperfect teeth and a great liking for warm beer and roast beef : - /, 
  am i being criticised for my flair here ? 
  if so , for the life of me i have no idea why . 
   nigel farage can kiss my belgian ... ;p he 's married . 
  to a german woman . 
  really . 
  he can kiss as much deutsch arse as he wants , when he wants . 
  you 're safe ... 
  disclaimer : well informed brit here , yet even my understanding is vague . 
  take my comments with a pinch of salt and do further research if you need to validate them . 
  from your question i am going to assume that you are primarily interested in the benefits system with respect to foreign migrants . 
  the uk benefits system is very different from the popular conception of it . 
  misunderstanding of the system is rife , and often wilfully so by vested and/or political interests with an axe to grind . 
  disingenuous scaremongering by sections of the press and other news media is widespread . 
  that said , it remains a very significant part of government expenditure . 
  benefits are generally thought of as being part of the overall [ welfare budget ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welfare_state_in_the_united_kingdom#expenditure ) , the lion 's share of which ( roughly half ) is comprised of state pensions and are not considered part of the benefits system . 
  when people speak of benefits it typically refers to housing and income benefits . 
  housing benefits are the largest share of welfare after pensions , and are paid to support the housing costs of low-income residents in rented accommodation ; income benefits come in a variety of different flavours , are paid to support those who would otherwise receive inadequate income to support themselves ( especially the unemployed and under-employed ) , and as a whole are roughly the same size as housing benefits . 
  benefits are a contentious issue and are often kicked around as a political football , with ( as a rather gross generalisation ) the left wishing to bolster the benefits system , and the right wanting to cut it . 
  much current political debate is centred on legal migrants from the european union coming here to avail themselves of our welfare system ( sometimes called ` benefits tourism ' ) , and this appears to be where much misinformation and misunderstanding is concentrated . 
  for instance , prior to the opening of our borders to migrants from bulgaria and romania on jan 1st , the uk independence party ( ukip ) and some of the daily papers were warning of an influx of 29m migrants , i.e. 
  the entire population of both countries . 
  this is clearly an absurd contention . 
  moreover widespread popular opinion tends to hold wholly unrealistic opinions regarding benefit tourism , e.g. 
  polling reported that britons believe 25 % of migrants will be on benefits ( it 's more like 3 % ) , or that migrants are routinely promoted to the front of the social housing queue , or that living on benefits is some sort of luxury cakewalk . 
  whilst there will always be headline-grabbing exceptions the experience of living on housing and income benefits is not desirable . 
  the idea that migrants who are well-enough motivated to move country and then to simply while away their days on benefits is shallow and unsupported by the evidence . 
  if you look hard enough you will find chaotic , unproductive migrant families cynically exploiting the benefit system , however the general picture is that eu migrants are a net contributor to the exchequer ; have lower unemployment rates than the natives ; often come here to work for a period and then return to their home countries ; work diligently at hard and poorly-paid jobs that the locals simply will not do ; and represent a relatively small burden on the benefits system ( and indeed the health system too ) . 
  sadly , much of he misunderstanding of the benefits system is motivated by prejudice against foreigners ( we are an island nation , those prejudices come easily to us ) and against the poor , especially those without employment . 
  there is much more that could be said , ideally by someone better informed than me , but i hope this helps to get the ball rolling . 
   in literature , it 's certainly heinrich heine for us . 
  goethe does n't even get a mention ? 
  he 's the big beast from my british standpoint . 
  so when and where will this work be visible ? 
  good luck with it !, 
  brit here . 
  not surprisingly i 've travelled around the uk quite a bit , and i just wanted to make a few less-obvious suggestions : - * [ applecross pass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bealach_na_b\u00e0 ) aka bealach na b\u00e0 , in wester ross , scotland . 
  on a clear day you can walk to the head of sgurr acharocain for a jaw-dropping view . 
  the rest of the highlands is pretty schweet too , i could probably list a hundred places off the top of my head . 
  * [ minack theatre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minack ) at the very furthest other end of the country , in cornwall . 
  drama never got more dramatic than this . 
  * [ bristol harbour ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bristol_harbour ) encapsulates a fat slice of british history , with echoes of slavery and tobacco , the twin engines of bristol 's prosperity . 
  * [ the view from general wolfe 's statue ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/greenwich_park_vista.jpg ) in greenwich park , london , which is right next to the [ greenwich observatory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_observatory,_greenwich ) and lots of other lesser-known parts of greenwich . 
  * take a trip on the [ north york moors railway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nymr ) , get off at levisham station and walk over the hill to levisham village for a ridiculously picturesque snapshot of a traditional english village . 
  any more for any more ? 
   london - paris - florence - rome seems like a very limited itinary to me when he has ~ ~ four months ~ ~ * 10 days * to do it . 
  ftfy . 
  it is indeed a little too much travelling for such a short break . 
  something very traditionally english , such as tandoori chicken masala . 
  * conviction * confirmed . 
  jail time seems vanishingly unlikely ; house arrest perhaps ; wishy-washy mealy-mouthed cop-out probably . 
  you have good taste , fine sir . 
  crumpets are indeed delicious , and often eaten by the barrow-load here in england . 
  tea , lots of tea . 
  and when i can be bothered to be virtuous - muesli with oj ; or more realistically - buttered toast , or crumpets , or a bacon and egg roll . 
  the greeks are running something like a 25 % of gdp primary budget * surplus * , i.e. 
  revenues vs. expenditure before debt service is included . 
  if they default there will be all sorts of shit to expect from the international markets , but they will be , for a little while at least , an economy that is essentially collecting vastly more than it spends on running the country . 
  perhaps this is why tsipras and varoufakis are straying so close to the edge ? 
  relief from the burden of debt by default will throw up a nightmare of problems , but it will also address so many intolerable domestic problems . 
  disclaimer : not an economist by any stretch , and i expect it will be a clusterfuck either way , but i can see that default has its upsides and wish that people would understand that element of varoufakis ' understanding of ` the game ' . 
   shortest : a or i can we get some love for o !, 
  as well please ? 
  for convenience and speed london city is hard to beat , so quick and easy to get to , get into , and fly away from , and an eye-popping location to boot . 
  tfl have really transformed london with such a universal integrated transport service , so much quicker and easier than during my time in london . 
  i 'm pretty sure nobody is forcing you to read these threads , so no , you are n't going to have to listen to the same thing every week . 
  use a little common sense and move on , and meanwhile those that wish to indulge in the debate can do so if they wish . 
  0 % religious ; uk . 
  all prices are * very * rough , you can definitely find outliers if you look hard enough . 
  these are all down to earth places selling food , not dining experiences . 
  all day breakfast at a greasy spoon : # 4 - # 8 depending on meal size and caf\u00e9 location . 
  pub lunches : loads of deals on offer if you go looking , but often requiring two people to go together : from # 5 each . 
  cafeteria/in-store caf\u00e9s etc. 
  sit-down fish and chips : # 5 - # 8 for e.g. 
  fish , chips , mushy peas , tea , bread . 
  sadly , that 's not lunch , that 's just the pathetic and unappetising processed shit that so many brits unquestioningly put up with . 
  i take your point about lemon vs. salt . 
  but my friend tequila begs to disagree !, 
  i love the greek attitude : food ? 
  needs more lemons !, 
  lemons make so many things better , gin & tonic , salads and dressings , and i like to cut a couple of slices of lemon into my roast potatoes - it works really well . 
  it certainly is . 
  that 's a coffee pot . 
  sweden , what on earth is going on with you guys ? 
   may the queen good grief , * please * be careful what you wish for . 
  came here , looked at the picture , thought `` there 's not really any clues , but i 'd still put my shirt on it being aberdeenshire '' . 
  was not disappointed since it seems to be near ellon . 
  rural aberdeenshire is the quintessence of gently rolling hills , absolutely lovely place , although as someone else said the highlands also have more than their fair share of beauty . 
  if you 're going to visit granada ( it 's choked with tourists but the alhambra and gardens of the generalife are * totally * worth it ) then why not stop and explore the [ caminito del rey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caminito_del_rey ) when you drive over the mountains from malaga ? 
  it 's astonishing . 
  go looking for youtube videos , you 'll be amazed . 
  french and spanish , but like any language they need a nice accent and intonation to sound good . 
  any language can sound rough from a rough speaker . 
  as a brit i think that english is the best language in the world by a distance .
