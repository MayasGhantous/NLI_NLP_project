i 've never heard that there were any serious settlements of people within the negev at the time of mandatory palestine . 
  are you sure that was definitely just a myth ? 
  in any case , the forced eviction of those who already lived there is another example of israel doing it wrong - why could they not coexist peacefully ? 
   it 's just a shame that israel , whilst promoting its own right to exist , actively denies ( through deliberate policy choices ) , the right of palestine to exist . 
  i 'm glad we agree that both states have a right to exist , even if their current actions are deplorable . 
  again , to their credit , a significant portion of the area was uninhabited at the time , especially the negev , which israel is currently attempting to ` terraform ' . 
  i do agree that the original partition plan gave a disproportionate amount of land to israel ( and israel 's expansionism into the area is pretty abhorrent ) , but i disagree with the idea that israel never had a reason to exist there in the first place . 
   it alleged that zionism was a form of racism and argued that zionists were similar to nazis . 
  again , not a common argument ; it 's a false equivalency to compare racist nazi ideology with a jewish state , and i think ( hope ) most people understand that . 
  that is n't to say that israel has n't done horrible things , but zionism is as racist as any country ( for example , scotland ) with a people of common cultural background wanting independence . 
  i sincerely doubt soviet propaganda is the reason why so many western anti-israel activists think that, 
  both israel and palestine have actors claiming to support their state who do despicable things to the other , be they state-sponsored or otherwise . 
  i 'm not interested in playing middle-east atrocity olympics to see who specifically is worse ; they 're both as bad as each other , and hence i do n't see any reason why palestine should not get recognition . 
  neither of them should get jerusalem , also . 
  your novelty account is shit and not even offensively funny and you should consider deactivating it, 
  to their credit there was a significant jewish population in british mandated palestine due to years of being pogrom 'd out of other countries ; just saying ` they made a jewish state ' almost implies that the un literally just pointed at a spot on the map and said ` yep , that 'll do ', 
  you 're not astroturfing hard enough if you do n't inject anti-islamic sentiment into joke threads, 
   cameron just announced in parliament up to 20,000 refugees from the camps bordering syria . 
  ` over the course of this parliament ' - i.e 20k over 5 years . 
   meanwhile our own homeless are left on the streets . 
  they would probably be getting better treatment if _ someone _ had n't been elected into power and axed a whole bunch of security nets, 
  indeed . 
  it 's not even like the left wing are calling for people to be censored - but criticising people and calling them out on their shit . 
  freedom of speech is not freedom from criticism yada yada . 
   the problem is when you leave the front door open and let as many people as want to come into your house the amount of portions needed increases while the cake is still the same size not really . 
  immigrants fill gaps in the job market which are currently not able to be filled . 
  by filling these jobs , businesses are more successful , make more profit , and are able to hire more people through expansion . 
  the profit they make is taxed also , and the economy grows . 
  the cake analogy is unrealistic because the cake itself grows as more people pay into it . 
  all of this is semi-dependent on spending on vital infrastructure which the entire population needs , which neoliberal governments are , by and large , completely unwilling to do . 
  hence the migration ` crisis ' has been overly inflated through poor statesmanship . 
   the people who 's portions are decreasing are n't the rich who 's party it is [ the rich have had their ` slices ' increased through other means . 
   they are perpetually offended . 
  nobody is as perpetually offended as right wing media when it comes to political correctness . 
  some of these policies are shared but not mentioned in-manifesto ( e.g stopping benefits being sent abroad ) . 
  from right to left : ** major parties ** ukip : leave the eu and implement _ le australian points based systsem _ ( and overall lower immigration ) , stop taking in unskilled workers , stop giving amnesty for illegal immigrants , stop taking in anyone with a criminal record . 
  encourage businesses to discriminate towards hiring british workers first . 
  overarching long term goal is to ` take control of our borders ' and ` regain british sovereignity ' . 
  [ 2015 manifesto ] ( http://www.ukip.org/manifesto2015 ) conservatives : ` renegotiate ' the eu ( ??? 
  ) , reform welfare rules to discourage immigration , ` clamp down on illegal immigration ' , enhance border security . 
  [ 2015 manifesto ] ( https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto ) lib dems : make sure all immigrants can speak english , enhance border security , end unnecessary detention . 
  [ 2015 manifesto ] ( http://www.libdems.org.uk/immigration ) labour : make it illegal to undercut wages for immigrants , ban recruitment agencies only hiring overseas , recruit 1000 more border staff , introduce exit checks , require people in public facing roles to speak english , ` tighten ' short term student visitor visas , end indefinite detention , continue accepting asylum seekers . 
  [ 2015 manifesto ] ( http://www.labour.org.uk/manifesto/immigration ) greens : use international influence to reduce war and discourage conditions which cause people to flee , help poorer countries cope with climate change , no restrictions on foreign students , abolish income checks , make it easier for adult dependents to enter the country , allow students to work for two years after graduation , end indefinite detention , provide free english classes , provide a path to citizenship for immigrants here for over 3 years , give victims of human trafficking temporary right to stay . 
  long term ( several decades ) goal is open borders . 
  [ 2015 manifesto ] ( https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/manifesto/green_party_2015_general_election_manifesto_searchable.pdf ) _ by and large the ` establishment parties ' ( lib/lab/con ) are completely unwilling to commit to either side of the debate ( and alienate voters ) , and either refuse to provide many policies ( ld ) , or make all their policies extremely vague ( con ) . 
  ukip and the greens elaborate on their policies to a greater degree and have much more coherent long term plans . 
  it 's possible that the labour approach will change if corbyn is elected leader . _, 
  the two are not really comparable . 
  redistribution of wealth through tax , public goods , is something which happens to combat issues of poverty etc on a domestic scale , in order to mitigate the wealth disparity . 
  i suppose you could make an analogy with foreign aid . 
  beyond that , it assumes that refugees etc are particularly happy about having to leave their homes in the first place - but feel like they have no choice due to war , no jobs , poor living standards , while g7 countries do n't really so much . 
  i do n't personally think migrant waves are a problem nor particularly unexpected while some countries ( including _ some _ g7 countries ) are still not at pre-recession levels of growth and while wars of hideous brutality continue to rage on elsewhere . 
  accepting asylum seekers is a good thing to do , but treating the underlying causes is just as important . 
  oh , they know . 
  david cameron has talked about the need for [ ' a leaner state - not just now , but permanently ' ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/lord-mayors-banquet-2013-prime-ministers-speech ) . 
  under the coalition government , the uk say [ bottom 50 % disposable incomes fall and top 50 % disposable incomes rise ] ( http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/redistribution-under-uk-coalition.html ) [ ( raw source ) ] ( http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/case/spcc/wp10.pdf ) . 
  it 's thatcherite policy for the 21st century . 
  cameron and osbourne do an excellent job of selling the economy as god to the public ( including the classic ` economy as bank account ' false analogy ) to the point where the average person believes that the deficit is a big deal - despite the fact that not only has it not personally affected them _ at all _ , [ few economists actually think the deficit is a big deal ] ( http://electionsetc.com/2015/05/06/the-dysfunctional-debate-over-debt-deficit-and-macro-economic-policy/ ) . 
  the us had ` deficit fixation ' previously , and has since gotten over it . 
  the uk certainly has n't . 
  at the end of the day , labour/other opposition are doing such a terrible job of [ actually challenging this bs ] ( http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/recognising-success-of-macroeconomic.html ) that the conservatives essentially have free reign to do whatever they want under the guise of ` helping the economy ' . 
  this includes osbourne selling off the royal mail at a fraction of its cost [ to his best man , who makes # 36m profit ] ( http://politicalscrapbook.net/2014/04/osborne-best-mans-hedge-fund-made-36m-profit-on-royal-mail/ ) ; cutting public spending and demonising those on welfare while quantitative easing gives billions to investment banks - while the bank of england finds that this is ultimately [ benefiting the rich far , far more than the poor ] ( http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/documents/news/2012/nr073.pdf ) ; house building is cut , causing [ london house prices to skyrocket ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/images/ed%20graph%203.jpg ) . 
  but ask someone in the street why we are n't doing anything about this , and they 'll probably tell you something along the lines of ` we do n't have any money because labour spent it all ' - which the tories are hardly likely to try to correct ( this particular myth is dismembered [ here ] ( http://benjaminstudebaker.com/2015/05/02/britain-for-the-love-of-god-please-stop-david-cameron/ ) ) . 
  [ the majority of the most read newspapers are tory leaning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_newspapers_in_the_united_kingdom_by_circulation#circulations_2010_to_present ) as well , so it 's not like anyone 's interested in actually showing this to anyone . 
  tl ; dr they know , but it 's in their interests not to correct themselves , and nobody is providing good opposition . 
  you might also appreciate [ the austerity delusion ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion ), 
   the concept of austerity is not really controversial nor should it be . 
  if you do n't have enough money to pay for the things you want and nobody is willing to give you any money , you need to spend less . 
  it 's really not that complicated . 
  it 's far more complicated than that . 
  investing in public spending can involve an increase in gdp as workers are more able/more willing to increase productivity . 
  it can also involve an increase in employment as jobs are created , due to the growth of the economy . 
  if your gdp growth is then larger than your deficit , you 're essentially in the clear . 
  austerity , on the other hand , cuts vital services ( often mostly used by the poorer members of society ) , resulting in gdp stagnation . 
  we can see that not only in greece but in the uk - the graphs are shown in my previous comment . 
   greece has far greater spending obligations than it can meet by itself , and this has been the case for years and years . 
  until now they 've been able to borrow , but when the crisis hit greece international credit markets dried up since and greece had to turn to lenders of last resort to continue to function . 
  greece accepted a bailout from the troika on the condition that they implement harsh austerity policies - [ here 's a paper cross-examining european austerity ] ( http://www.academia.edu/4083342/the_austerity_trap_economic_and_social_consequences_of_fiscal_consolidation_in_europe ) . 
  it finds that :  the austerity policies in europe have deteriorated rather thanimproved the fate of the european economies ; increased rather than decreased the national debt ; and raised rather than alleviated social suffering through enormous cutbacks in the social welfare , healthcare and education systems ; the lay-off of many public-sector workers ; the increase of theunemployment rate ; labor market reforms that made employment relationships more insecure and reduced wages ; a deterioration in overall health ; a rise in suicide and depression rates ; and a rise in social unrest . 
  ... although a simple graph showing [ greek unemployment ] ( http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/507693b46bb3f7316f00002b-600-376/greek-unemployment.jpg ) can also do a good job of showing how fucked over they 've been . 
  [ another paper ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-greek-economic-crisis-the-social-impacts-of-austerity-debunking-the-myths/5431010 ) explains the social impacts of austerity . 
  you are correct in saying that greece 's situation has been caused by a lack of investor confidence , but i 'm saying that confidence may have remained if austerity had not been implemented . 
  ultimately the austerity which has been implemented has damaged growth - meanwhile , the eu central bank sends a [ massive bailout ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/thomas-fazi/troika-saved-banks-and-creditors-%e2%80%93-not-greece ) to the financial sector with few obligations - but it 's a whole different story for the state itself . 
   what is the alternative in a situation like that ? 
  i do n't know exactly , i 'm not intimate with every detail about greece . 
  several sources are suggesting a cancellation of debt , or another state bailout - but essentially it boils down to greece needing a big financial stimulus . 
  where it 's going to come from , i do n't know . 
  it could come from the troika releasing the second bailout earmarked for greece , but it needs to essentially come with no austerity obligations . 
  even the imf do n't believe in austerity anymore . 
  [ blog here ] ( http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/the-imfs-evaluation-of-2010-austerity.html ) , [ source material here ] ( http://www.ieo-imf.org/ieo/pages/completedevaluation227.aspx ) . 
  no economist has taken austerity seriously as a concept for at least five years . 
  [ here 's an essay by krugman ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion ) with more about how atrocious it is . 
  we 've known since at least [ 2012 ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/10/12/imf-austerity-is-much-worse-for-the-economy-than-we-thought/ ) that austerity actively _ damages _ economic growth .

  ok kid, 
  i 've answered all of these points in other comments . 
  i 'm not going to bother doing it against for someone who seriously thinks  isis is not even any different from saudi arabia . 
  the saudis are just richer and more comfortable .
