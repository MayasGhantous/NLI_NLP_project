  does anyone else feel like something is ` off ' about the way it 's written ? 
  the syntax is all whacked . 
  giving people what they want is not populism . 
  populism is an insidious ideology which pits two ill defined groups against each other in order to give the populists more power . 
  in this case it 's the ` everyday man ' against the ` metropolitan elites ' who are also in cahoots with the immigrants , or soros , or the jooz . 
  populists appeal to our basest instincts and foster division and hatred in society , usually in order to achieve some personal goal . 
  in europe 's case , populists are either purposefully ( in which case the are traitors ) or inadvertently ( in which case they are putin 's useful fools ) trying to destabilise the eu and europe in general for their own gain and the gain of their masters and patrons . 
  yeah , we 're waking up . 
  waking up to see that russian backed nationalist-populist traitors like le pen are a massive threat to liberal democracy and must be quashed . 
  that 's manuel valls . 
  the next president of the ep will be chosen from amongst the ranks of the epp , the s&d or alde . 
  this means , that no matter who the next president is , they will almost certainly have the same views on europe as schulz and verhofstadt have . 
  i 'm having trouble believing these official polish government statistics . 
  how do you go from deficit to surplus within a year , with no spending cuts , huge spending increases , no significant tax increases and economic growth at roughly the same rate it has been for a decade ? 
  can somebody with a better understanding of the economic situation in poland explain how this is possible ? 
  edit : according to these [ 1 ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/tylko-203-mln-zl-deficytu-budzetowego-po-maju-7527438.html ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/prawie-6-mld-zl-nadwyzki-budzetowej-po-czerwcu-7533651.html ) two articles , tax receipts , especially from vat have increased substantially ( about 30 % ) . 
  in addition , due to a weakening currency , the national bank has recorded profits of 9bn pln , 95 % of which was transferred to the budget . 
  however , experts predict that by the end of the year , the budget will have a 30bn pln deficit , which would be the highest since 2010 . 
  the catholic church in poland is almost a separate entity . 
  to some polish catholics , papal authority died with john paul ii . 
  others decry francis as a leftist . 
  the polish episcopate and clergy behaves as if it were the polish national ( ist ) church , rather than a part of a huge , global organisation led from the vatican . 
  pis are n't even conservatives . 
  po is the conservative party , pis are authoritarian , nationalistic populists . 
  conservatism is primarily about the preservation of traditional institutions and the rule of law . 
  the only traditional institution pis cares about is the catholic church , they want to destroy or warp the rest . 
  for a conservative , the constitution should be sacred , meanwhile pis is breaking the constitution left and right . 
  pis are reactionaries , they want to go back to the 1920 's and 30 's , a dictatorship hidden behind the illusion of a democracy , they see kaczy\u0144ski as the 21st century j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski . 
  [ compote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compote ) is not [ kompot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kompot ) . 
  she is the moderate . 
  all potential replacements are hardcore brexiteers , more loopy and swivel-eyed than her . 
  or boris , and that 's just a fucking disaster . 
  comparing theresa may to voldemort is like comparing donald trump to sauron . 
  alde is the natural , obvious party for em to join . 
  not sure there was much seduction involved . 
  i did answer your question . 
  the washington post article is confusing ` conservatism '' with ` economic liberalism ' this is because in the united states , the vast majority of conservatives are economically liberal , or as they would say in america , ` fiscally conservative ' . 
  in europe this is not the case , christian democratic parties , christian democracy being the main strand of conservatism in europe , are generally not as economically liberal ( i.e. 
  `` right wing '' ) as liberal parties are . 
  fiscal conservatism is the same thing as economic liberalism . 
  the word ` liberal ' in the us has been stolen by various progressives and other left-wingers because of the two party system . 
  affirmative action for example , which so many ` liberals ' in america support is a decidedly illiberal policy because it promotes equality of outcome rather than of opportunity . 
  emmanuel macron is socially liberal , because he is progressive on social issues like equal rights for women and various minorities , he wants to defend civil liberties and privacy and he cares about individual freedoms . 
  he is also economically liberal because he believes in economic freedom , he wants to reduce the size of the public sector and the bureaucracy , he wants to deregulate the labour market and he wants spending cuts . 
  how difficult can this be to understand ? 
  `` you are mixing economic and political spectrums . '', 
  what ? 
  clearly you have no idea what you 're talking about , economics is a huge part of politics , economic theory is a fundamental part of most political ideologies , economics and politics is inherently and forever intertwined . 
  macron is a liberal and therefore a centrist . 
  he is not a conservative . 
  that 's what i 'm arguing . 
  a left leaning source would naturally see a centrist as a liberal , because macron is a centrist and a liberal , not a conservative . 
  yes , ** social liberalism ** is on the centre-left of the political spectrum , i 've already said that , but ** macron is not a social liberal ** , just like the ** majority of liberal parties in europe are n't social liberal ** ( except notably , as i have already mentioned , the lib dems and d66 ) . 
  most liberal parties in europe , including macron ( although he 's not a party himself ) follow a mixture of social liberalism and classical/economic liberalism , which is why ** most liberal parties are centrist or centre-right ** . 
  the ( 2 ) conservatives macron appointed to the cabinet are ** economic liberals ** just like ** macron is an economic liberal ** . 
  ** economic liberalism ** meaning small state , free trade , free market , low taxes , limited state intervention , equality of opportunity over equality of outcome , private property and private enterprise , etc. 
  you said : `` washingtonpost leans to the left of the political spectrum . 
  of course they see a centrist as more conservative rather than liberal . '', 
  this does n't make sense . 
  liberalism is in the centre of the political spectrum in europe , with conservatism to the right and socialism ( more often social democracy ) to the left . 
  someone on the left of the political spectrum would see macron as being to the right of them , i.e. 
  a liberal . 
  liberals are to the right of socialists and social democrats but to the left of conservatives . 
  macron is a liberal , he is socially liberal and he is ( mostly ) economically liberal . 
  modern liberalism is an americanism . 
  in europe we use the terms social liberalism and classical liberalism ( sometimes called economic liberalism ) , all european liberal parties subscribe to different versions of either social , or classical liberalism or ( most often ) something inbetween . 
  both the liberal democrats and the fdp are liberal parties , even though the fdp want to shrink the state , reduce taxes and privatise stuff whereas the lib dems do n't , even though the lib dems are centre to centre-left and the fdp is decidedly centre-right . 
  what unites these parties is their belief in the basic liberal values of freedom , equality before the law , trust in individuals , the rule of law and equality of opportunity over equality of outcome . 
  uhh , actually , most liberal parties in europe are considered centre or centre-right , with the notable exceptions of the lib dems in the uk and d66 in the netherlands who are centre to centre-left . 
  liberalism is centrist . 
  sometimes centre-left , sometimes centre-right , depending on the country and the liberal party , but it 's centrist overall . 
  americans not understanding european political terms . 
  liberal economics is free market economics , macron is a liberal , both socially and economically . 
  it just so happens that most modern conservatives are relatively liberal economically . 
  he 's not a conservative lol . 
  right to work = / = right to a job . 
  clearly , everyone should have the right to sell their labour . 
  you do not , on the other hand , have the right to a job , you must compete for one , and if you are n't good enough , you lose the competition . 
  train and try again , or look for a different job instead . 
  the capitalist system clearly works , it has brought billions of people world wide out of poverty , it has made europe and the west the most prosperous part of the globe . 
  countries which adopt some degree of free-market economic policy do much better in all metrics than countries that do not . 
  there is a reason capitalism is almost totally dominant , it works . 
  it sometimes has to be restrained by governments , but on the whole it has provided unprecedented prosperity . 
  it makes everyone better off compared to all other economic systems . 
  communism and socialism have again and again proven to be totally ineffective ; any wholehearted implementation of socialism is bound for destruction , we saw it in eastern europe , we saw it across the globe . 
   french can not do that , because there is not a richer country than france in europe . 
  uhh , germany ? 
  that 's just the size of the economy . 
  in terms of median income there is also the netherlands , denmark , norway , switzerland , sweden , austria , finland , iceland , ireland . 
  whilst not generally true for manual labourers , professionals can enjoy a higher quality of life in some parts of eastern europe despite lower wages due to a lower cost of living . 
  do n't you need training to be a metalworker ? 
  surely it 's cheaper and less risky to hire someone who is already trained and has years of experience than taking on unemployed , untrained young people . 
  more importantly , it does not have to be the same job , there are other jobs available in france , and even if there are n't , there are 26 ( well , technically still 27 ) other countries in the eu , some are richer than france and some are poorer but there are jobs in all of them . 
  if eastern europeans can do it , the french can too . 
  nobody is entitled to a job , it is n't a right by virtue of citizenship , that 's not how a capitalist system works . 
  why is finding a new job at 50 such an extraordinary notion to you ? 
  same with emigration ? 
  i know lots of people who changed jobs at the age of 50 or older , and i know a lots of people from eastern europe who emigrated and found a job in their new country without even knowing the language at age 50 or older . 
  if eastern europeans can do it , i do n't see why french workers ca n't . 
  that 's the whole point of the eu no ?
