time to confront ** extremists ** head-on . 
  you would n't call every catholic a molester because of those beast priests ... maybe you would , but you should n't lol, 
  as long as we 're clear , 
  now now !, 
  i 'm not going to lie and * up sell * murderwell !, 
  ... cleverly sets flair as eu flag so i ca n't make a specific comeback . 
  damn you sir . 
  damn you . 
  oh my god !, 
  i 'd like to sincerely apologise to any nations who are blighted by this monstrosity !, 
  lol, 
   i 'd wager that your own comment is being downvoted for being mean-spirited , and ignoring the rule of ** `` time and place '' ** . 
  it just drags the conversation down to the shit-sodden pit of politics and the deeply serious and angry people who populate it . 
  go to / r/ukpolitics we 're trying to laugh over here . 
   of course they were going to say that . 
  i agree . 
  because it 's a valid position to hold . 
  you want scotland out of the uk 's money circle ? 
  we 'll guess what 's in that money circle ? 
  the debt . 
  done . 
  but ... we 're all having a laugh here , it 's a light-hearted post . 
  i 'd wager that your own comment is being downvoted for being mean-spirited , and ignoring the rule of `` time and place '' . 
  it just drags the conversation down to the shit-sodden pit of politics and the * deeply * serious and angry people who populate it . 
  the folks at the school of art are great !, 
  i felt really terrible when the place burned . 
  maybe i just do n't notice it , since i 'm not really looking to go on any tours of his buildings . 
  it seems like he 's been oversold a bit ; he 's good , do n't get me wrong , but he 's not even my favourite scottish artist . 
  i prefer jack vettriano . 
  he 's no antoni gaudi . 
  gaudi is one of my favourite artists and his buildings have * shaped * barcelona ; compare that to the influence mackintosh in glasgow and the scot 's contribution seems paltry in comparison . 
  if you 've seen mackintosh described as the `` gaudi of glasgow '' then i 'd agree who ever made that claim has been a bit disingenuous . 
  but the best example ( that did n't burn ) of his works has to be the tearooms , and the house of the art lover is n't all that far away . 
  it should n't have taken 40mins on a bus , but that 's glasgow 's roads i suppose . 
  i * really * do n't want to get into a whole debate about it on this light-hearted post ; but the possition of the `` yes '' camp was that the pound was a shared asset , not one for any single nation in the uk to lay claim to . 
  scotland helped build the pound , so it 's only fair that they should also be able to use it no matter what . 
  the deal was that , if ruk politicians and bankers wanted scotland out of the picture entirely economically speaking , then the debt is included in that too . 
  maybe ... 
  i actually really like stroopwafels lol, 
  you once knocked rangers out , so as long as you do n't do the same to celtic you 'll be friends of the club lol, 
   stroopwafel in north east scotland , `` stroop '' is a word for penis . 
  there 's loads of wee rugby clubs going here , i do n't know about a specifically * french * one but rugby 's an edinburgh thing and i 'm in glasgow lol, 
  a few , not too many lol but there 's * loads * at the edinburgh fringe etc. 
  i 'm just talking about how people perceive it here , and there 's 100 % some west-coast bias built into that  lol, 
  perfectly intelligible . 
  this young man cheated on this picture of loveliness and admitted it , but she 's claiming there were more . 
  that being said , you could have guessed that was what they were talking about on jeremy kyle lol, 
  whisky      whiskey, 
  good for killing a hangover too . 
  i know scots and germans are equally as interested in a food 's ability to do that lol, 
  it 's just a mars bar , that 's been deep-fried . 
  started off as an experiment i think , some chip shop owner being daft with a fryer , then comedians got a hold of it and spread the idea far and wide in their stand-up routines . 
  this prompted more and more chip shop owners to start making them as a novelty . 
  simple and disgusting , yet oddly delicious . 
  the city is safe . 
  like every other city , there are places you do n't go in the dead of night , but it 's not really any more dangerous than your typical city . 
  in terms of prestige , glasgow uni is held in high regard . 
  it 's perhaps regarded as 2nd in scotland , with st. andrew 's uni taking 1st . 
  locally , the uni is seen to be full of out-of-touch hipsters who 've had a privileged life , but like to pretend their one of the ordinary glasgow people . 
  i do n't think that 's really true , but it 's true for enough people at glasgow uni that this reputation has firmly stuck . 
  sunshine ? 
  it 's * beautiful * today , and a nice 19 \u00b0 c , but this is rare . 
  expect rainy and overcast days , and you 'll be pleasantly surprised when the sun shines . 
  i ca n't speak for groningen , since i 've never been , so i could n't exactly help you make this choice by comparing the two lol, 
  the `` scottish legal tender '' . 
  [ or the `` smackaroonie '' ] ( https://youtu.be/briql4lviqu?t=1m36s ), 
  ironic that his name is `` buckfost '' , which is but one letter away from [ one of our favourite things !, 
  ] ( http://i4.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article1536200.ece/alternates/s615/buckfast.jpg ) even the english get it right sometimes !, 
   yet it wont be long . 
  thought i might as well get this one so we 're not rushing about on the big day trying to make satirical posts on reddit to represent us lol, 
  ** scotland ** - [ mostly talk of a bin lorry crash which happened in glasgow a few days before christmas last year , killing six . 
  was the driver at fault ? 
  is he innocent ? 
  the inquiry is ongoing .

  a scottish band won for the first time in a decade .

  here come the tories to ruin the joke !, 
  :d i can almost hear the tea being spat out lol, 
  my school-level french tells me that this is pure vulgarity !, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  when they 're on holiday , the english make a beeline from the airport to the nearest ex-pat `` british-style pub '' . 
  `` go outside and sample the local culture ?!, 
  what are you ? 
  lol, 
  they 're coming in so quick that we 'll have all of europe covered by the end of the day lol, 
  we can start from the top , you start from the channel and we 'll meet in the middle to divide up the spoils lol, 
   this is the capital of scotland , glasgow ah , the way it should be lol, 
  us celtic peoples need to stick together !, 
  except for the scots . 
  auld alliance represent !, 
  since we 're going back that far , my bloodlines are probably in ireland when those lads were kicking about doing their thing . 
  it 's all for the craic t ` be sure, 
  i love the free flow of up-to-date on-the-scene information that comes from social media , bit it goes both ways really . 
  look at how people started a rumour about a fire at the calais camp . 
  that lie made it in to the news . 
  i 've seen a few news outlets say isis `` claim responsibility '' , but it looks like the evidence they 're gathering for that comes 100 % from twitter . 
  i can trust reddit more than i can trust major news these days lol, 
  looking at it , all of the posts i can see that use this hashtag are positive .
