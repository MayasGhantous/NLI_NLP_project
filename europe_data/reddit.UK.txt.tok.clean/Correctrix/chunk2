  a sugar diet means you starve without fasting , which is perverse . 
  you spike your insulin several times a day , making you weak and listless , without any fat for long-term energy or protein for tissue repair . 
  it would make far , far more sense to cut out all the sugar and only have fat and protein . 
   edit : 44km is just over one marathon in miles . 
  errm ... it 's also just over one marathon in kilometres . 
   once as part of a juice fast , juice is just squished food . 
  does n't count . 
  to be fair , google is exactly where you should be asking stupid questions . 
  it would be annoying to have people ask a lot of these things in reddit comments or suchlike . 
  if people quietly enlighten themselves on a computer by themselves , and then only expose human beings to somewhat higher questions , that 's actually a win . 
  just looked it up in my collins english-german unabridged . 
  it gives `` albtraum * m * , alptraum * m * '' . 
  it 's an attitude you can find in france and some other countries , whereby they decide that english is the international language , which in reality it is only kinda-sorta . 
  i remember the italian girl living in the same student residence as me in paris , who only spoke italian and french , and who would constantly have french people ( who surely often did n't really have much english anyway ) speak to her in english when they heard her italian accent in french . 
  they 're usually coloured pink , actually . 
  charming little towns and villages offer a calmer , simpler life , with much more space than you can afford in the city . 
  yes . 
  not a city though . 
  edit : ok , ok , fine , reddit has spoken . 
  it 's a teeming fucking metropolis . 
  here 's something that will shock , but there are usually several different ways of characterising a situation . 
   he 's right , [ * correctrix * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/correctrix ) is a blatantly [ feminine ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/category:english_words_suffixed_with_-rix ) noun . 
  it 's fine to want to read more , but you 're implying that it 's made up , which is a bit dickish . 
  i said it was anglo-saxon , because it was in that period that the term was used to refer to the foreigners ( non-germanics ) that the anglo-saxons encountered in britain , and it was in england that the term became more restricted in use , and became our modern world `` welsh '' . 
  however , the history of the term goes way back to the times of proto-celtic and proto-germanic , because of course anglo-saxon did n't spring up out of nothing . 
  we certainly do n't have to assume that words in anglo-saxon have to have origins subsequent to the transferal of said people and their language from the jutland peninsula to britain . 
  the name of the tribe known in latin as the volcae probably comes ultimately from a celtic root meaning `` hawk '' , and refers to a roaming celtic people who popped up in places like southern gaul , anatolia and macedonia . 
  their name became known to germanic people ( such as the north sea germanic-speaking people who would be known as angles , saxons , jutes , and later just as english ) in the form [ * walhaz * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walhaz ) , and soon any neighbouring people ( mostly celts , but also romans or any other non-germanics ) were so labelled . 
  it practically meant `` foreigner '' , much like * barbarus * for the romans . 
  when germanics encountered such foreigners , they 'd apply this label . 
  in britain , this meant anglo-saxons , or english people , calling people in the celtic fringe of the west of the island * w\u00e6lisc * , until eventually it became exclusively the name for that people . 
  in the south-east celtic fringe , it gave the modern name `` cornwall '' . 
  in other germanic-speaking regions , it similarly was used to refer to whatever non-germanics they encountered . 
  to this day in switzerland , non-germanic-speakers ( i.e. 
  francophone and italophone swiss people ) are called * welsch * by the german-speaking swiss . 
  really ? 
  it 's not exactly implausible or controversial . 
  it 's an anglo-saxon term that originally referred to the volcae ( celts from the south of france who invaded macedonia at one point ) , but quickly was generalised to refer to any celt or indeed anyone not germanic , virtually meaning `` foreigner '' . 
  later , it came to be restricted to the central western celtic population of britain who call their own country * cymru * . 
  when i encounter iranians , they tend to be inordinately happy that i know they are persians ( i.e. 
  aryans , just like europeans ) as opposed to arabs . 
  http://i50.tinypic.com/qovslz.png get them in western clothes , and they often could be europeans . 
  to make him look dark , you had to compare him to someone who is fully half white and only counted as black due to the ( somewhat racist , really ) american convention according to which black parent + white parent = black child . 
  they are n't blond swedes , but most iranians are n't really different from europeans of the mediterranean . 
  some have a bit more mixture with neighbouring arab peoples . 
  islamically , this guy is indeed right . 
  the masked arab ( an atheist who analyses islamic doctrine ) recently did a video on this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqwsqh9yhea, 
  it 's just an effort to virtue-signal and show `` hey , i know that countries often have minority languages ! '' . 
  yeah , well done . 
  you 're so special . 
  none of the rest of us knew that . 
  you badly misspelt `` short '' . 
  hey , they 're americans : give them credit . 
  we 're lucky they did n't put the mexican flag for spanish , and a new york pizza for italian . 
  the saddest thing is that even if you are born in japan , and even if one of your parents is ethnically japanese , you are never considered japanese . 
  you are forever an outsider , and will often be spoken at in broken english by japanese in your own country instead of in your native japanese . 
  * yesterday , i * accompanying * friend * arriving * party go perf . 
  coverbs ( which replace the function of prepositions ) in italics . 
  plurals and determiners not needed . 
  perfective particle at the end after the main verb . 
  in english , you mostly just add an * - s * . 
  however , half the foreigners i hear around here just do n't make anything plural at all : `` da coss ten dollar . 
  cass only . 
  you wan plessy beg ? '', 
  it really does n't matter how complicated a language allegedly is . 
  the sort of person who does n't bother to get * t\u00f6pfe * right does n't get `` dollars '' right after twenty years in the country either . 
  ca n't poles kinda-sorta understand russian anyway ? 
  my school had compulsory french in year 7 , then a choice between spanish , german or latin in year 8 . 
  if we ignore the latin ( due to the prestige of our classics department ) , i think it 's probably a fairly typical language set-up . 
  then at uni , the four tongues of the department of modern languages were french , spanish , german and russian . 
  that 's for that link . 
  i 'll use it when people make this claim about germans being oh so good at english . 
  sure , they are better than spaniards and hungarians , but they are n't a patch on the dutch or scandinavians . 
  * it 's sad that so many countries are overwhelmed by the tsunami of the culture of us english-speakers . 
  what did it stop to sell pork and alcohol ? 
  the muppet is a particularly impure animal amongst cockneys . 
  yes !!!, 
  society should pay for them to be a lesson to others , so that we do n't suffer more attacks . 
  a free ticket ) to the area that many of them are trying to get to anyway , where they can murder other people at will , and prepare for more attacks on the west . 
  genius idea , dude . 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  those movements of borders were due to the imperial actions of nazi germany and the ussr , and have always been harshly condemned . 
  the theft of palestine by israel is the same but more recent , and continuous . 
  israel is doing that right now . 
  when was the last time france did that ? 
  there 's a difference between land occupied in the depths of history , and land occupied in living memory . 
  israel was created a few decades ago and they are actively building new settlements in palestinian territory ** now ** . 
  that is very stupid . 
  yes , i get the yearning for revenge . 
  but these people 's ** objective ** is martyrdom . 
  we should do everything possible to keep them alive and humiliated in prison . 
  yeah , this stuff practically has me yearning for the days of the ira . 
  they were extremists , but at least their objective ( a united ireland , versus imposing a hellish theocracy on the world ) was sane , and they targeted armed men ( police and soldiers ) whom they perceived as occupiers , rather than going straight for ordinary men , women and children minding their own business . 
  negotiation was possible with them . 
  i indeed suspect that they would be the tallest in the world . 
  they get a bit more food than sudanese people . 
  there is n't really a contradiction . 
  i migrated to this country , and i dislike people who migrate here and fail to integrate or commit crime . 
  if you 're going to play silly-fuckers , there 's no point in talking to you . 
   where on earth do people get a fair go , if not in germany ?
