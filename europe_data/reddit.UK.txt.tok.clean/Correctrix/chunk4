  it virtually always means something politically motivated , and is to be translated as `` terrorist attack '' , `` assassination attempt '' , or similar . 
  jfk being shot was an * attentat * . 
  9/11 was an * attentat * . 
  the relevant proportion is of their numbers to the general population of where they are , not where they are from . 
  if a mere 1 % of chinese people ( over thirteen million ) showed up in the uk , you would n't think it 's anything like 1 % of icelanders ( 3,000 ) arriving . 
  it 's really not subjective , or likely to carry on much longer . 
  do you think that people will be ritually cutting kid 's genitalia in 2100 ? 
  that 's a bit loopy . 
  no , fgm does n't have to be highly damaging . 
  sometimes it 's a ritual nick . 
  male circumcision is damaging by design in all cases . 
  we do n't wait for abuse to die out . 
  we outlaw it , and stamp it out . 
  we 've already waited long enough on this issue . 
  at-risk boys and girls need to have routine examinations , and if cigarette burns , bruising from beatings , genital mutilation , or other signs of abuse are documented , the parents need to be swiftly brought to justice . 
  in a few decades , it will seem insane that anyone ever questioned this . 
  we should allow fgm by that logic . 
  sometimes deformities make it advisable to do corrective surgery on girls ' genitalia , and yet no one brings that up when people are ( with undeniable justification ) condemning ritual or cosmetic snipping of ordinary girls without their consent . 
  because that would obviously be an obscene veering into apologetics for barbarity . 
   this is something that i just ca n't understand . 
  did you not read the date ? 
  are you going to complain about the romans making insufficient use of tasers next ? 
  i guess that 's conceivable . 
  the company will look into it as a matter of course . 
  i see comments crazier than that all the time , without any hint that they are n't sincere . 
  hell , firebombing poles ' houses is crazier still , but i do n't think they did it in a spirit of irony . 
  you misspelt `` iceland '' . 
  it 's a bit weak . 
  any leaver watching that would just say that things like torture were n't a problem in the uk . 
  if you want to make an argument that government can be evaluated by crude measures of `` size '' like the amount of people and territory it covers , or the number of acts on the books , instead of what it actually ** does ** , then make an argument for that . 
  that does n't make sense . 
  i made the point that this is par for the course , and you 've just repeated your talking-point , doing the schoolyard thing of repeating part of the structure of my sentence ( `` some people ... '' ) . 
  i guess that was supposed to imply that i 'm upper class and in a `` gated community '' ( something i 've only actually heard about regarding america ) . 
  i regard myself as european because i am european ; and since i 've never been one for xenophobia , such feelings have never been able to cloud my mind and cause me to be in denial about being european . 
  my family was too poor for private tutors , so as a kid i saved up for cheap books and tapes , and taught myself several european languages from scratch , shivering in my barely-heated bedroom , dreaming of the day i might be able to experience these cultures . 
  my single mother , who never finished school , never once had the funds to allow us to have a foreign holiday in all my childhood ( we went to butlins once though ) , but when i was 19 , i hitch-hiked down through france to spain and enjoyed myself thoroughly , talking to as many people as possible , always in their own language , noting how different and how similar they all were . 
  i 'm now an interpreter . 
  i help migrants and travellers benefit from access to healthcare and justice , where it would otherwise be denied to them because of their lack of knowledge of the language . 
  it 's very underpaid , but at least i can use my skills to help people . 
  some people ( e.g. 
  you ) are talking like this is the first poll or election where people have said the other side are awful . 
  i 've got plenty of national pride as english , british and european . 
  i 've grown up with the concept of a tiered identity , like all britons . 
  there should be a united states of europe . 
  it 's too early though . 
  we need a few more decades of integration , focusing on prosperity and stability , deepening slowly , and broadening slower still . 
  governments are n't `` big '' or `` small '' . 
  that 's idiotic american ideology . 
  what matters is what government ** does ** . 
  north korea 's government is `` small '' in that it rules over fewer than 25m people . 
  somalia has just 10m , and has no government to speak of , as they are in kenya and have no control , leaving the nation lawless . 
  i 'd much prefer to be ruled by the `` big governments '' of the uk , usa , or the whole of the eu . 
  it 's a complete and utter non sequitur . 
  you actually think that 's an argument . 
  i guess you completely missed the first line . 
  also , a brexiter talking about reality . 
  someone from the take-a-pen crowd . 
  the eu is jeopardised , yes . 
  but the uk is finished . 
  scotland will secede and there will be a united ireland . 
  i think i can see cairo in the distance . 
  i 've just done a quick google search for `` i have a lot on at the moment '' , and there are four and a half million pages using the phrase . 
  all the ones i looked at are using it to express being busy , as i 'd expect . 
  it 's a phrase that english-speakers can be expected to have come across at some point . 
  australia is just one of many places i have lived . 
  move somewhere people speak english then . 
  `` to have x on '' is a common phrasal verb that expresses plans and tasks , e.g. 
  `` i 've really got too much on at the moment ... really snowed under . 
  i 'll get back to you when i have time to breathe . '', 
  this is exactly the same as the english `` have you anything on , later ? '', 
  except that they keep adverbs closer to the verb . 
  it 's really not a big deal . 
  the norm for new cars . 
  and it will become increasingly untenable ( morally and legally ) to drive a car yourself . 
  when it is understood that going autopilot means reducing the risk of killing someone to 0.5 % of the current risk , then the current situation of being able to kill people and get away with it as long as you can say you were n't majorly reckless or malicious will necessarily evaporate because driving manually will be a reckless decision given the easy availability of an alternative . 
  no politician will have to ban it . 
  it just takes a lawsuit . 
  you killed my husband because you wanted the pleasure of driving , but there was a slippery patch , and you had a moment of understandable human inattention that would n't have been a problem if you had let the computer drive . 
  it will be equivalent to applying make-up while driving : a decision to maybe kill someone because it 's convenient for you . 
  when all accidents are being caused by the 30 % of people who still do n't have self-driving cars , those people will pay virtually all the car insurance premiums paid in a country . 
  already , a huge proportion of accidents are caused by teens and people in their early twenties with little driving experience . 
  we have elaborate systems in place at the moment to stop those people specifically from killing people . 
  they have to have special plates , drive accompanied for a certain time , etc etc. 
  how long before all these kids are only allowed to use self-driving cars ? 
  how long before anyone with a speeding or drink-driving charge is not given a slap on the wrist like now ( because of the assumption that every adult needs to drive to work ) but is simply banned from driving for ever because there is an easy alternative ? 
  not ignore . 
  that 's a straw man you set up based on nothing . 
  put into perspective . 
  this is a very minor attack , completely dwarfed by the death-toll of the decision to base our transport system on the private motorcar . 
  we must resist the urge to see such attacks as bigger than they are because of the media . 
  that path leads to rounding up all the muslims . 
  it is not a euphemism . 
  pakistanis in the uk are n't called `` arabs '' or something in daily life , then transmogrify into `` asians '' when they commit terror . 
  they are called asians because they are asians . 
  because he was . 
  i hate those particularly , because yes we do need to outlaw cars as we know them . 
  they kill a million people a year . 
  self-driving cars will be the norm within a decade . 
  more people have been killed by other cars in the last few weeks . 
  a few hundred years before that , you were raiding coastal villages wherever you could find them , and enslaving the * europeans * there .
