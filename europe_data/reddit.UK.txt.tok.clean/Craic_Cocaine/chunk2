   do you think women and black people deserve equal rights ? 
  what does that have to do with whether the news should be covered impartially or not ? 
  i 'm not going to be baited by your question , so no , i 'm not answering it, 
  you 're cringe-worthy , you know that ? 
  it 's why i hate talking to ideologues , they ca n't possibly understand the perspective of another person , or be put in those people 's shoes, 
   there was a clear pattern on which ways different areas voted , so especially if an entire country voted to stay in , they should respect that vote . 
  gee , i bet you 'd also like scotland to manage her own independent foreign affairs and have her own military ~ ~ and currency ~ ~ , would n't you ? 
  thankfully , the people of scotland voted against such ` nationalist ' nonsense too . 
   majority never equally correct , womens rights , black people 's rights , the church and millions are usually historically wrong . 
  that 's merely your opinion . 
   how does someone 's marriage affect you in anyway ? 
  i do n't know as personally speaking , it does n't really bother me , but i know that it bothers millions upon millions of people , ergo , it is n't really a closed , settled issue, 
  well , seeing as millions upon millions do n't see this as bigoted , nor do they see homosexual marriage as ` equality ' , i 'm going to go with * ` yes , because that 's the impartial , legal thing to do ' *, 
   yes they did vote and they voted to stay in , so they are being taken out against their will the united kingdom voted out , that same united kingdom that scotland voted to remain in , thus scotland too , voted out . 
  seeing as the eu is a foreign affairs issue , it was a federal referendum , not a nation-by-nation one . 
   they 've not mentioned the pound dropping to a 168 year low either , do you even read the bbc ? 
  * [ the pound 's fall and why it matters ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37620331 ) * [ less than one euro to the pound at many british airports ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37609114 ) * [ what 's happening to the pound ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37584727 ) i see * many * stories about the crash in the pound sterling over the last few days , and today . 
  i see absolutely none about this important development underway in france . 
  name to me an acceptable source , so that i can post it and you wo n't dismiss it with a lazy , ignorant handwave ? 
   the state owned mouthpieces of countries are never fully impartial , politicians make that impossible for them . 
  right , but my point was is that legally-speaking , what you are proposing the bbc do is strictly forbidden . 
   a bunch of idiots takes one to know one now , does n't it ? 
   scotland being forced out against their will . 
  scotland voted in the eu referendum , what are you talking about ? 
  people from land 's end to john o'groats voted in the referendum , so no one is being taken out against their will . 
   maybe it 's because they do n't want to stand in the way of human progress ? 
  that 's not what we pay our licence fee for  or run highlighting far right hate at this time would n't be wise . 
  we do n't pay the bbc to ignore the news for propaganda purposes . 
   given two men getting married does n't affect anyone 's lives but there own what business is it of the ` know what 's best for everyone ' types anyway ? 
  i do n't think you understand how the bbc 's supposed impartiality ( not that i ever believed it existed anyway ) works, 
  [ not a damn one of these things changes the solid , indisputable fact that england subsidises scotland , and does so heavily to the point of it being unfair . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/12200495/ifs-scotland-to-get-billions-of-english-income-tax.html ), 
  probably because it 's based in the west ? 
  this reminds me of those arguments that zionists use , * `` why are you always picking on little ol' us when north korea does blahblahblah '' *, 
  cute quip aside , it does n't change the fact that the average english taxpaying family [ subsidises scotland 's free shit ] to the tune of almost # 500 a year . 
  if you want to be independent so damn badly , why not start by demonstrating financial independence ? 
  we do n't just hand teenagers the credit card over without learning proper pecuniary self-control , why should scotland ? 
   maybe you should pick up a newspaper once in awhile . 
  right , i 'm showing too much independent thought , i have n't washed my brain in a few good months , thanks for the reminder !, 
  [ scotland pays far less tax per head than english households , ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/are-the-scots-really-sucking-up-a-massive-subsidy-9723797.html ) meaning that ultimately , we 're subsidising her numerous attempts at belittling us . 
  well , if there is proof , why do n't you give me some . 
  i 'll shut up if you put up . 
  go to http://www.bbc.com/news/world and take a good long , hard look at how this story gets zero coverage from our state media ( instead , some story about a panda is covered , but not this ) . 
  reminds me why government-controlled media is such crap to begin with, 
  pretend now that this is [ a picture of a hook-nosed jew holding some gelt in his hand ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/3d/45/78/3d4578d593fa0dd29c4b5e987a94efe8.jpg ) saying ` oy vey , muh anti-semitism !!! ', 
  would you say * that * was offensive , and if so , why was that offensive , but not the image you just posted , which portrays russians as alcoholic animals ? 
   ukip 's not a russian front . 
  members of ukip are regulars on rt and receive favourable media support from the russian state , including offering farage his own tv show . 
  i 'm not so easily convinced of the claim that rt is russian ` propaganda ' ; propaganda means to alter the news so as to fit your agenda , and there is no proof nor evidence that rt is altering the news , only that they 're reporting it from a pro-russian slant ; 2 . ), 
  statist groups like syrian observatory for human rights receive favourable media support from the british state , including documentaries on bbc one meant to influence and alter public opinion . 
   the eu recently put rules in place to prevent foreign sponsorship of eu political parties . 
  yet the eu wo n't stop meddling in the foreign affairs of countries like syria , libya and ukraine . 
  why wo n't they take their own advice ? 
  more like ` angry ' that my countrymen ( i live in the us now , so no , not jealous ) will be stuck with the bill of another one of scotland 's un-affordable pet projects . 
  how will we be ensured that this wo n't end up costing the english ? 
   every baby born in scotland will get a ** free ** box try telling the englishmen paying for scotland 's cute attempt at being a scandinavian country that the cost is * ` free ' . 
   if this political agenda has something to do with europe , you can post links to some articles that cite your agenda . 
  so * that * explains all of the rampant russophobia around here !, 
  good to know !, 
  downvoted to stop the spread of anti-russian paranoia and racism ( which is already rampant on this subreddit enough as it is ), 
  nowhere does that article say that ukip is a russian front . 
  just like the us and eu have done to ukraine !, 
  i agree though , ngos the world over are a disease, 
  til that if you 're anti-war , you 're also pro-putin , or something, 
   comeback funny me , and here i was thinking that all the road signs were in miles , beer was measured in pints , and pounds and ounces were still common measurements for things such as sugar and meat . 
  turkey is , [ according to the german intelligence reports , supporting terrorism and insurrection in syria and even funding isis throughout the middle east , ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/german-govt-turkey-supports-terror-groups-in-middle-east/ ) and they get this innocent , naive question . 
  and yet , russia gets all the bad press for what 's going on in syria , just by looking at this . 
  well done western media , i 'm sure you feel accomplished for this coup in the propaganda campaign to begin world war iii with russia . 
  ... [ except of course , when it is n't . 
  ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/swedens-free-speech-charade/ )  * now , reinfeldt and bildt are n't lying , per se , when they tell you that freedom of the press is enshrined in the swedish constitution . 
  it is . 
  but so are explicit restrictions on that freedom.chapter 7 of the relevant section catalogues 21 types of `` offences against the freedom of the press . '', 
  some , like # 4 ( `` unauthorized trafficking in secret information '' ) and # 17 ( `` threats made against a public servant '' ) , are standard even in the most libertarian democracies . 
  others are more draconian , like # 15 : `` insulting language or behavior , whereby a person insults another by means of offensive invective or allegations or other insulting behavior towards him . 
  the uk is the guy who has no friends . 
  technically denmark , since greenland 's coastline is massive, 
  why was the president of poland flying an aircraft from more than 25 years ago ? 
  why was he getting off at a rarely used airbase in the ( relatively speaking ) middle of nowhere ? 
  something does n't add up at all here . 
  note : contents contained therein are homogenous , results not typical , keep out of reach of diverse nations, 
   the moscow times i 'm still waiting for their write-up on how ultra-progressivism came to become the eusa elite 's ` chosen path ' . 
  actually , estimates say [ there were only 5000-7000 in attendance ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/women-in-black-protest-polands-new-abortion-proposal/ ) , it was so bad that there was someone calling it out on / r/media _ criticism that made the front page there, 
   let them have their vote , and if the vote indeed shows that what the polls say is true , then it 's fine . 
  if not , then you are just pushing the will of the majority down the minorities throat . 
  that 's how democracy works , whether you like it or not . 
   no its because the uk is made up of different countries , looking at eu and un the are represented by countries , its is not '' ethnic chauvinism . '', 
  its how the world works democratically to represent societies . 
  the nation had a vote on the referendum as one federally united kingdom ; it 's no different than when we have parliamentary elections and we hold a federal , general election . 
  democracy was served . 
   yes it was outvoted by other mps , the same that voted for english votes for english laws . 
  which also makes your above comments invalid . 
  no it does n't , because the eu referendum , being a foreign affairs issue , is a federal issue , not a scotland issue , not a wales issue , etc. 
   if it was federal scotland would have a veto over foreign affairs ( eu ) , defence . 
  and have everything else under the full control of its parliament , it doesnt . 
  but alas , the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland is in fact , a united kingdom , and that is how the federal government chose to hold the vote ; it was n't an english only vote . 
  wait , did another one happen that i 'm unaware of ? 
  this sort of thing is how documentaries become clouded with bias . 
  amen . 
  they hated us anyway , and it 's not like we did n't go it alone before without the rest of the continent involved in british affairs,
