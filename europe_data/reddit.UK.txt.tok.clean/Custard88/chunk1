i 'm not sure if it 's especially good compared to the ones you chose , but it 's certainly a prominent member of the three british ` nuclear war is hell ' films : when the wind blows , threads & the war game, 
  ` when the wind blows ' is a pretty grim one . 
  i sure hope rt are n't insinuating that the uk is using its drones in a similar capacity to the us & cia . 
  the uk 's drones are used in a purely battlefield role . 
   tags : anglo-german axis oh dear , lol, 
   totalitarian humm , not sure how thatcher was a totaliatrian given how she rolled back the rampant state intervention in the uk . 
  have you really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like ? 
  not in terms of seats though you silly goose . 
  i 'm sorry , but i think it was a pun . 
  ` post-nuclear ' refering to the decline of the [ nuclear family .

  as a war-leader yes , but not as a politician . 
  i dunno , that sounds a lot like censorship ... 
   i also feel a bit sad that you think `` eh , good enough '' when it comes to your welfare system being in the upper-middle-class of `` good systems '' instead of thinking `` we can do better '' . 
  there are drastic diminishing returns for welfare/health spending at the upper end of the scale , in the early 2000s money was pumped into the nhs and it improved leaps and bounds . 
  as time went on the funding kept rising but the quality of care plateaued , you have to draw the line somewhere at what is economical to provide , that 's just a downside of socialised healthcare . 
  * betteridge 's law *, 
  god forbid their currency have an appropriate value for its worth . 
  w-what ? 
  where did that even come from ? 
  well yeah ... what does the telegraph think military exercises are for ? 
  i 'm sure they 've also rehearsed defence scenarios . 
   neoconservative ( bringing back corporal punishment in schools and capital punishment , as well as obviously abolishing the equal marriage act ) . 
  there 's not many of those in the * cabinet * to be fair . 
  right , i 'm just going to shut you down quickly here before the ` le ebil tories ' gang arrive . 
  this is a local measure being introduced by * hackney * council , which is controlled by an overwhelming labour majority with a labour mayor . 
  there are only 4 conservative councillors on the council iirc !, 
  eurofighter very good , you buy , yes ? 
  much better than rafale , you buy ? 
  you 're reminding me of my own over-analysis of political cartoons back in gcse history . 
  do n't be an idiot , it was about in depth military cooperation and the possibility of creating a joint expeditionary force . 
  not creating a unified army . 
  i would not call it a case of ` modern vs antiquated ' warfare , that would be a huge oversimplification of what is really more of a comparison between conventional and counterinsurgency warfare . 
  the russian army is far more organized along the lines of its cold war ancestor than modern western militaries are . 
  in fact i 'd wager the russian army still operates soviet deep-battle as the operational doctrine of choice , with the focus being on large numbers of tanks and mechanized infantry working together with close artillery support . 
  this is n't necessarily an obsolete school of thought , in fact it 's one that western armies ( excluding the us ) probably do n't have the resources to resist . 
  if you impose tariffs it 's not a free trade deal ... 
  they 're really no reason to worry , even the most anti-immigration elements of the leave campaign are n't advocating trying to get rid of the people already here . 
  it would be madness , literally no-one wants it . 
  [ i know , google is very hard .

  i think you just used some very confusing wording that made it sound like you were describing something completely different because everything in your first post is so completely bizarre it sounds like a collection of half remembered anecdotes . 
   they 've got a voting restriction called `` local representation '' , news to me . 
   which means you may only vote for politicians who happen to live nearby . 
  haha , what ? 
  i can see how you might make that mistake in a country with a pure pr system though . 
  the country is made up of 650 constituencies , one for each seat in the lower house . 
  at election time each constituency has a vote among the people who live there . 
  people may stand in these elections on a party ticket , or as an independent , there is no residency requirement for the candidates . 
  but the voters are less likely to look kindly on someone standing to be their representitive who does n't even live there . 
   and if the plurality of your neighbours vote for a different candidate , you do n't even get any representation at all . 
  i do n't know where you got this one . 
  look up the westminster parliamentary system on wikipedia . 
  this is such a hilarious mis-understanding . 
  maybe it 's just the way it 's written that makes me want to burst out laughing . 
  if you 're quoting , perhaps you should quote what was actually said . 
  that 's why they 're called quotation marks . 
  : * ^ * ) as for the other point , i did n't really take issue . 
  if you scroll up i was just explaining in very brief terms the purpose of the lords , which he questioned . 
  in fact i do n't think his first post even mentioned democracy , what posts are you reading ? 
  i do n't nessesarily think that a replacement need have a democratic element . 
  i know people who act as if it 's a given that the lords should be reformed for the sole reason it is undemocratic and i ca n't say i agree with them . 
  and putting things in `` quotes '' that he never said makes / u/custard88 sad . 
   but you ca n't really blame `` foreigners and ignorants '' for being baffled by it . 
  oh i definitely understand any confusion , it just annoys me that people jump to pass judgement on a system they do not fully understand . 
   wouldnt it be more logical to add some ` checks and balances ' instead of keeping an undemocratic zombie-institution ? 
  easier said than done in the british system . 
  no parliament can bind another . 
  huh ? 
  if britain had a only single house of parliament then a government * would * be more or less a dictatorship for 5 years . 
  the pm has a huge amount of power , we have no written constitution and no real checks and balances to speak of . 
  pms with a large majority like blair are extremely influential and with no hol to fight can more or less do what they want , even if their party is n't really keen on the idea . 
  not all countries are the same , or have the same political system ... 
  surely you understand this ? 
  on balance i like our system but it ** needs ** the lords . 
  no idea , but i honestly think an unelected lords is downright required for them to review as legislation effectively as they currently do . 
  you fucking bet it 's nessesary . 
  the lords is there to stop the government being an elected dictatorship and send back the completely crazy bills like 90 day detention without trial . 
  sure it could do with reform , but people should realise the important constitutional role the lords play in reviewing legislation . 
  sadly , foreigners and ignorants often ca n't look past the name and would rather we had a senate . 
  i shudder at the thought , the last thing we need is another mid term popularity contest . 
  it seems everyone gets to have a go of that title eventually . 
  i feel sorry for you if you 've never found yourself in a group of friends absolutely pissing yourselves at a joke . 
  the quip was n't amazingly intelligent , but it was quick witted and i could easily see myself laughing a lot in that situation . 
  i pity the people in this thread who seem to be implying they have never laughed with their mates for over 20 seconds straight before . 
  hated by some in the same way blair is hated by some , personally i quite like them both . 
  and bear in mind , that poll mentions respect . 
  she may not be liked but she was definitely respected . 
  a long period of real ` negotiation ' that makes what we have seen so far look quick and easy . 
  it will suck up both british and european political capital for a considerable length of time . 
  i 'm no expert on the possible impact to the eu , but it could easily go either way as to benefiting or accelerating the demise of the european project . 
  as for britain ? 
  for one i doubt that foreign nationals need fear deportation , i imagine that securing a bilateral deal where brits & europeans are given visas to remain in their country of residence at the time of referendum or similar will be one of the first things agreed upon . 
  * i see no real reason for this not to happen . 
  * there may be demand for a 2nd scottish referendum from the snp , people forget this needs to be accepted by the westminster parliament to happen . 
  such a vote would ** not ** be granted in the immediate aftermath of a brexit , at the least a period of several years would need pass first so that the immediate turmoil could subside before any prime minister would allow such a vote . 
  the uk will not get the exact trade deal it enjoys at the moment , but i doubt that any retaliatory punitive terms imposed by the eu will be as bad as many ` iners ' claim . 
  to be honest i do n't see either side as having a decisively stronger economic argument in this referendum . 
  arguing that businesses & factories will relocate is a central pillar of the remain campaign , yes . 
  however the campaigns have not really begun in earnest yet and likely will not for some time .
