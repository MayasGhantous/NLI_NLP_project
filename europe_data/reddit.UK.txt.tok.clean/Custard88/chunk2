  that 's a bit of a meme to be honest . 
  the output of the manufacturing sector * as a percentage * of gdp has steadily decreased over the past 50 years , but in terms of it 's actual output is and almost always has been rather strong when not compared with the services sector . 
  ** for those behind a paywall : **  toyota will keep making cars at its plant in the english midlands even if the uk votes to leave the european union , chief executive akio toyoda in a boost for campaigners wanting a brexit . 
   the comments by mr toyoda , the great-grandson of toyota 's founder , will offer reassurance to the thousands of staff at its assembly plant in burnaston near derby and its engine plant at deeside in north wales . 
   but his remarks will be a blow to the campaigners for the uk to remain in the eu , and also to david cameron who last november at a private meeting in downing street urged non-british chief executives of some of the uk 's biggest companies to put their weight behind his eu renegotiation . 
   one of the in campaigners ' key arguments is that an exit will damage britain 's economic prospects and lead to an outflow of corporate investment . 
   senior bankers from hsbc and barclays last week said that , although brexit would be expensive and disruptive for the uk 's financial services sector , it was unlikely to unseat the city of london as europe 's main financial centre . 
   speaking to the financial times for today 's joint nikkei-ft special report on japan , mr toyoda said his predecessors buried a time capsule at the burnaston plant 25 years ago , and the company would still be there to open it in the year 2090 . 
   `` from now on , like japan , we may face some pretty tough times in the uk market , '' he said . 
  `` but we want to deepen our roots to deliver ever better cars , so when that capsule is opened after 100 years , all can see we 've built a truly british company . ''  pro-eu campaigners have hoped that big carmakers would also support the remain campaign . 
  in 2013 carlos ghosn , the chief executive of nissan which makes cars in sunderland , said of the brexit debate : `` if anything has to change , we [ would ] need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the future . ''  burnaston was toyota 's first factory in europe : a powerful symbol of japan 's industrial success , as well as then prime minister margaret thatcher 's efforts to revive british manufacturing via foreign direct investment . 
   the derbyshire factory made 172,288 vehicles in 2014 -- more than 10 per cent of total uk auto production . 
  in 2011 , toyota invested a further # 100m to produce its next-generation auris hatchback at the plant . 
   most of that output is exported from the uk , so burnaston relies on easy access to european markets that could be threatened by any tariffs or trade barriers in the wake of an exit from the eu . 
  toyota also has assembly plants in france , turkey , portugal , russia and the czech republic . 
   long-term , mr toyoda hinted that access to the eu market could affect decisions about the burnaston plant . 
  `` in the sense that investment equals capacity , then various things come into it , like the size of the market , '' he said . 
   `` but there are other kinds of investment : in research , in development , in people . 
  some you can see and some you ca n't , some take a long time to pay off , but when we have the strength i think it 's important for us to make those investments . ''  japan 's large investments in the uk offer some protection in the event of a brexit , say industry analysts , because with so much at stake any reallocation of investment would necessarily be gradual . 
   mr toyoda emphasised his family 's emotional connection to the uk , going back to 1929 , when the sale of his great-grandfather 's patent on an automatic loom to platt brothers of oldham provided the capital to enter the car industry . 
   he said that despite the near extinction of domestically-owned uk car companies , the home of rolls-royce , mini and range rover has retained its brand image , and is still an attractive location for the auto industry . 
   `` i think a strong manufacturing workforce and parts supply chain are characteristic of the uk , '' said mr toyoda . 
  `` i understand it was judging on those factors that we choose to put our first european plant in britain . ''  japan 's long history of significant industrial investment in the uk may have afforded some safeguard against a rapid retreat . 
  with so much at stake , any reallocation of investment would have to represent a long-term shift in strategy , analysts say . 
  well ... duhh, 
  it 's a rocket , not a guided missile ... 
  i doubt it , dave is pretty content with his cabinet and he 's not going to punish ministers after he explicitly gave them a free vote . 
  that was the mistake the opposition made and dc will want to minimise any comparisons the media may draw . 
  if he 'd said no to suspending collective cabinet responsibility it would have been a media circus of eurosceptic resignations . 
  3 at the very least , perhaps even including boris . 
  an unsurprising development , there are few downsides to suspending collective responsibility . 
  humiliating his minsters by forcing them to lie in public when everyone knows their real opinions would have been a dangerous move that risked embarrassing resignations and maybe even a return of massive tory infighting over europe . 
  it was bombed during the second world war and rebuilt deliberately too small in 1950 . 
  some of these look a bit too much like dreary students unions to be honest . 
  france & italy are goat however , even if i prefer the adversarial ` non rounded ' chamber style . 
   united kingdom - both chambers are awfully overcrowded . 
  the reasoning is that most members do n't turn up for every debate , and even those that do do n't stay for the full debate since they have other business . 
  so the chamber is deliberately ` too small ' so that it does n't look empty on days when there are a normal amount of people in there . 
  which make it extra cosy for pmqs , budget day and the like .

  it helps that no other country is still interested in operating aircraft solely for high altitude long range interception . 
  yes , sometimes it gets up to 15 degrees !, 
  no , but she would no doubt trust a labour leader . 
  cameron is not the permanent supreme ruler of the uk , making decisions based on the assumption the tories will be in power forever would be a ridiculous move . 
  another point is that cameron and his party are far more accountable to the british electorate than any eu based political body and are therefore more suitable to negotiate trade deals . 
  so she 's not with the majority of scots ... 
   is there a possibility that once there is a firm deal on the table , that they will go back to the voters and say `` this is the deal , do you want it ? '', 
  a miniscule probability , there is very little reason for may to do this given the conservative party and it 's voter base . 
  it would be a disaster for her politically , there is very little appetite on the right for a second vote . 
  the only reason a second referendum on the deal is being pitched by the liberal democrats is that they know it 's an easy way to overturn the referendum . 
  tell eu you will ask british people to ratify deal after the 2 years . 
  eu has even less reason to give a good deal than now , they offer the worst exit conditions possible . 
  brits vote to reject the deal and remain .

  you are of course , correct .

   their economy is n't prioritised in relation to london  this is claimed a lot on reddit , but i 'd be interested if you have any evidence of this ? 
  it 's a load of bollocks , see : www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn04033.pdf, 
  it 's nearly 10 % of gdp , it 's ** huge ** , one of the largest in the developed world . 
  floating a new scottish currency with public finances in that state would be madness , and they would have to say goodbye to any prospect of cheap borrowing . 
  bearing in mind that to join the eu a requirement is to have a ~ ~ debt : gdp ~ ~ deficit : gdp ratio of less than 3 % . 
  ** edit : ** my brain typed the wrong word, 
  can london set it 's own tax rates ? 
  does london have a huge package of devolved powers and competencies ? 
  the mayor of london is little more than a glorified salesman , advertising the city abroad and managing transport policy . 
  london gets a great deal of money spent on infrastructure projects , but it accounts for a huge chunk of gdp and houses more souls than a small country . 
  ** edit : ** and yes : www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn04033.pdf , per capita scotland receives more funding than london . 
   uh yea , scots dont want the nukes in scotland [ this is a myth ] ( https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/734349177329733633 ) , the snp has many more polices than it 's attitude to trident and one ca n't assume that an snp majority means a majority back every single one of their positions . 
  at the very most it is an issue that splits the nation with no clear majority for either side , despite what snp rhetoric would have you think . 
   the scottish economy is n't being prioritised i 'm not sure what you mean here , the scottish economy is very much a special snowflake compared to other uk regions . 
  the scottish parliament has tonnes of devolved powers and competencies , including the ability to set many of it 's own tax and spending rates . 
  and receives more money per head from the central exchequer that most ~ ~ ( all ? 
  ) ~ ~ other regions of the uk via the barnett formula . 
  this deficit is just the product of the snps reckless magic money tree policies , it 's a shame that the calibre of opposition in scottish politics is typically poor due to the brain drain to westminster . 
  thank god the scots * are * still in the uk , for their own sake . 
  bit of a whoops there , the snp independence white paper was '' '' '' * forecasting * '' '' '' '' oil revenues north of # 7 billion by 2016 ... ** edit ** : for those who have n't read the article yet , current annual oil revenues are about # 60 million . 
  well they could , they 'd just have to * radically * adjust their public spending priorities in a way that would once and for all destroy the socialist image the snp has cultivated for itself and take away many of the publicly subsidised services scots currently enjoy . 
  surplus may not be necessary for public fiances , but starting a new country with a deficit the size of scotland 's would be a disaster , especially if they wanted to float their own currency . 
   why should she wait and allow the scottish economy to go down the drain along with rest of uk in the meantime ? 
  scotland is actually far less effected by brexit than most of the uk . 
  the vast majority of their exports are to the rest of the uk and they have barely any multinationals based there in comparison . 
  westminster is the body that makes them legally binding . 
  chances are may will give the snp a second indyref ( it would be suicide not to ) , but only under conditions she approves of , ie : when the uk has fully left the eu in early 2019 or whenever it is . 
  this would give time for the situation & scottish public mood to calm down and avoid the colossal shitshow that would be holding a referendum whilst negotiations have not yet finished . 
  that was n't live , that was from earlier on the evening i thought . 
  most of the footage did n't have the ' live ' icon in the corner at the end of the night . 
  my theory is that the pro-coup jets had to return to base for fuel after the full-afterburner passes they pulled early in the evening . 
  when they got back they never received orders to return to istanbul , possibly as the momentum seemed to be with erdogan as the evening continued . 
  much of the military throughout the night was just waiting to see who the victor was after all . 
   one of the f16 's shot down the coup 's helicopter that was firing on the police headquarters afaik , that report was never confirmed . 
  it looks like it never happened , there is extensive mobile-phone footage of just about everything in this coup and a shot down helicopter is no-where to be seen . 
  helicopter crash sites are not exactly inconspicuous either . 
   however erdogan was in turkey and ... free .
