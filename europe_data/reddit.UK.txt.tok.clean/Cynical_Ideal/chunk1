as an ardent lover of fish and chips i can not in anyway condemn another for loving to deep fry things . 
  not the same effect , self-pity rather than actual fear of patriotism . 
  when you see someone with the scottish flag do you think racist ? 
  people do when they see the confederate flag or even , in some cases , st george 's flag . 
  you 've misunderstood , i meant something that would make scots feel ashamed of being scottish not something that would make the english nationalism seem sordid . 
  besides , we 're already at that point . 
  if only all redditors followed your example . 
  down voting is ridiculously overused in most subreddits . 
  no , that 's not enough i 'm afraid . 
  maybe reintroducing wicker man like sacrifices ? 
  no , that 's still popular but i meant something that would make you feel ashamed of scottish nationalism . 
  like a national tradition of beating children or burning puppies . 
  no , sheep shagging is a particular insult reserved for the welsh and the new zealanders . 
  the irish and scots are alcoholics . 
  australians are convicts . 
  canadians do n't really have an personalised insult but at a stretch can be taunted as americans in denial . 
  the english are the bad guys . 
  i 'm pleasantly surprised . 
  i thought at least the scots would be disapproving . 
  i do n't think the results of different secessionist groups has that much of an effect on each other . 
  scotland rejecting independence has n't dampened catalonian aspirations . 
  and you do it very well , dear fellow . 
  nah , that 's the welsh . 
  if only the scots had some national vice that we could guilt trip them over . 
  from one country with an exasperating secessionist group to another . 
  spain , you have my sympathy . 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ now , ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ downvotes . 
  oh scotland , you tire me so . 
  we would appreciate the help . 
  with the size of the us navy i believe you guys could almost pull it off . 
  ha , you probably could but i have no idea how . 
  you could buy equipment to help widen the channel . 
   the us is presently the biggest beast in the anglosphere , and probably the most-diverged from the uk . 
  canada alone is already half of the uk 's population . 
  if the anglo union were established as a replacement for the eu , ** this would n't be the british empire . 
  ** just as germany and france and italy have their own wants , desires , and concerns that sometimes conflict with the uk 's , so again would members in the anglosphere . 
  he did n't suggest this in the article . 
  he merely suggested that the uk would be better aligned with countries that have similar linguistic , cultural , legal and political viewpoints , probably in a free trade capacity and * maybe * some manner of freedom of movement ( even here i am reading too much into his suggestion ) . 
  he specifically points out that this should n't be seen as looking back at the past . 
  this is a frequently parroted criticism of any proposed closer relations with the `` anglosphere '' nations and in many cases it is quite disingenuous to do so . 
  you 're right that the anglosphere nations would n't agree on everything but they certainly would n't agree less than the current eu membership does with the uk . 
   do other members want to establish such a beast ? 
  because if you 're leaving the eu with the intention of establishing an asu , you ca n't simply count on that . 
  i 've seen some polls that canada and australia would be happy with freedom of movement with the uk . 
  but that 's rather different from an asu . 
  the us has also historically rather-valued having an ocean on each side , like the uk 's english channel , but on a greater scale . 
  many of the anglosphere members went to quite a bit of effort to establish their current level of independence . 
  true , that was within the context of an empire , but they 'd have to look very closely at doing something that at least looks superficially like simply handing over something that they fought over ( in the case of some members , literally ) . 
  in particular , ireland , which the author lists here , seems likely to be a tough sell . 
  yeah , this is something most of the british public also think would be a problem with some kind of union with anglosphere countries and most brits , predictably , are quite pessimistic on how we would be received by some nations . 
  nevertheless , if the out campaign focused on winning these nations around or even giving the impression to the british public that some anglosphere nations were considering it favourably , then the outers would have a considerable boon . 
   i do agree that there are , in some important ways , things that make sense . 
  only france really has the same overseas military concerns that the uk does . 
  it would certainly get the uk access around the world that it had in the past . 
  over all the time since the anglosphere countries split apart , they 've not really had much by way of fundamental political incompatibility ( at one time , the us and democracy versus monarchy ) , and that seems unlikely to change . 
  but it 's not really a no-brainer that can be examined casually as an alternative to eu membership in a single paragraph . 
  agreed . 
  easy for you to say , you 're not sitting so close to the fire . 
  the heat is getting quite uncomfortable . 
  that 's a fair perspective . 
  i myself drift between believing that that a federalised europe is an unrealistic and undesirable prospect and the belief/hope that eventually the world will gradually drift together so why not start here in europe ? 
  but then again when someone suggests that there are more suitable countries to unify with i find it hard to argue against that point . 
  true , the in side are in greater need of an overwhelming victory to hold off the potential of repeat referendums . 
  like scottish independence the out sides only have to win once . 
  oh christ , let it please be at least 60 % one way or another , we do n't need another case of neverendum ( looking at you scotland ) . 
  i 'm more afraid that this debate wo n't settle british opinion because it 'll be focused on the economic element rather than political/ideological arguments . 
  otherwise we 'll just see another referendum down the line when further , inevitable , changes are made in the eu . 
  i ca n't speak for all the british people but this certainly aligns with my views on the state of the eu up till this point . 
  there 's a reason why the in campaign will be focusing on the economic benefits of the eu and that 's because everything else either does n't appeal or looks like it 's doing shit . 
  if the economic argument starts to weaken or seem unconvincing then the in campaign is essentially fucked . 
   since germany , france , sweden and the ** uk ** are the primary actors http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/27356421801803075/82f5e30e6720e9d1d723664e44f55e51fcbe26eb/, 
   `` perhaps scots just want to make sure that after separation from england , they would still have something to whinge about . '', 
  our questions about pro-eu sentiment in scotland have been answered . 
  all about plum jam . 
  the uk is leading the world in jam experimentation . 
   uk , ** france , italy ** and poland would have to band together . 
  those two working together is not unlikely but getting us involved ? 
  take a miracle to get us more invested in this union . 
  i was n't suggestion that we should , just highlighting the potential problems and pitfalls . 
  playing devil 's advocate . 
  the ultimate solution is to stabilise the regions surrounding europe . 
   clearly you missed the part where i said `` legal '' as well as viable ... not at all i was merely being facetious . 
   the definition we would be using is the one defined in article one of the refugee convention , so as to abide by international law . 
  but that 's exactly my point , the article , as in a lot of legal jargon , possesses some limited vagueness that allows interpretation . 
  the phrase `` well founded '' is exactly where controversial debates will crop up . 
  well it 's certainly not the only viable solution , i 'm sure a few of our more distasteful members of our society would suggest gunboats and land mined border fences but as those ideas are morally repugnant and generally unpalatable then yes this is the only solution . 
  however , the real debate comes when deciding what qualifies people for asylum status as i 'm sure there will be quite a few people who will dispute certain judgements . 
  i mean look at how people view a `` right to a family life '' here . 
   this seems so fucking simple to me if only it were so . 
  unfortunately people lie and many will have destroyed any documents relating to their identification , if they have n't been lost along the way anyway . 
  now , it 's not impossible that eventually the nationality and circumstances of various of these migrants/potential refugees can be determined through translators and analysis of dialects etc. 
  but that will take time and a great deal of difficulty . 
  it is the end , my son . 
  the white stallion of the semi-naked conquerer gallops across the northern plains to the darkest of seas . 
  the red steed of war rides from the east to encircle these lands , it stomps on the ground restlessly . 
  the fell black beast of famine wanders across europe , complaining of the falling prices in milk and other assorted dairy products . 
  the pale horse glides over the waves of the mediterranean , shining like a full moon on the water 's surface . 
  and heathen and heretic alike are ensnared by the lies of the whore of london . 
   the uk has the best idea heresy !, 
  itt : more europeans supporting corbyn than brits .
