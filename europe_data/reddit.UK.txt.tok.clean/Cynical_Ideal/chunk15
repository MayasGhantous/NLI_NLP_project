  probably not . 
  but culturally and politically it is probably more attractive . 
  obviously you are not obliged to agree but , honestly , would you admit that anything is an alternative to europe ? 
  i 'm simply stating that the idea that there is an anglosphere is no more ` shite ' than the idea that there is a unified ` european ' culture . 
  in fact i would argue the former is a far more easily defined concept than the latter . 
  as opposed to this nauseating ` european ' shite ? 
  i think it would be more accurate to say that we ca n't `` painlessly '' leave the single-market . 
  an unsurprising statement considering the many years of integration on that front . 
   ( or they just lie through their teeth ) . 
  it 's this one . 
  they 're the reason ( well at least one of the main ones ) that there has been this disconnect between the eu and the british public on what the whole project is . 
   you do n't choose which class you are born in . 
  this lack of choice is why people need democracy , so that the poor people can participate and hopefully alter the system to their benefit as well . 
  i see little point for democracy if you could choose your social class . 
  everyone would just be an aristocrat . 
  of course this is illogical but it illustrates the point . 
  but you 're proving my exact point , if you could choose to be prosperous ( or an aristocrat ) then you would happily live under an oppressive system . 
  you value prosperity over your freedom of action . 
  regardless democracy is an attempt to foster greater social cohesion and durability during times of national difficulty . 
  if people feel like they have a stake in their society or system of governance then they are more willing to defend it . 
   well , it 's really the same question just re-cast in a scifi setting . 
  so : why is that bad ? 
  i 'd say , with that technology , it 's not bad at all . 
  we 'd probably use that technology if we had it readily available . 
  you lose very little and gain experiences beyond your wildest dreams ( i.e. 
  sex with two chicks at the same time ) . 
  haha , i think you 've taken my matrix example too literally . 
  i do n't mean the choice between a virtual reality where you create your fantasy but a stable society where you are safe and fed etc. 
  but lacking any real decision making power or `` choice '' vs a more dangerous world where you have greater say over your life , or `` destiny '' for lack of a better word . 
   people were asked to vote for an outcome , leaving the eu , that can be satisfied in a multitude of ways . 
  i do n't see why one way of getting there is more valid than the other ways . 
  if the position of eea membership was merely a transitional stage on the way to full exit then your point would be a valid one but we all know that it would n't be . 
  furthermore what does leaving the eu mean ? 
  is it simply satisfactory to say that britain has left the eu while maintaining constraining ties , a paint job in effect ? 
  the argument over soft vs hard brexit is n't lent credence by the fact that the position we had achieved through cameron 's negotiations was probably as ` soft ' a brexit as we could achieve . 
  this option was still rejected in favour of an actual brexit . 
   ideally , this referendum should be the start of a discussion . 
  like an alarm bell , one that the whole eu should react to , but your government first of all . 
   but it was n't the start of a discussion , it was the ultimate and irrevocable end of it . 
  so i guess we will never find out ? 
  or are there polls that i am unaware of ? 
  i hope you can shed some light . 
  i think the discussion started when cameron first announced his attention to organise a referendum or more precisely when the conservatives won the 2015 election . 
  but you 're right , this referendum result is the collapse of those negotiations . 
  this result is also the inevitable realisation that the eu can not be viewed solely through an economic prism , something british leaders either refuse to acknowledge or deceitfully hide . 
  as for polls , we 're bombarded by them every day . 
  ranging from people regrexit : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-second-referendum-poll-vote-leave-voters-regret-four-out-of-ten-remain-europe-a7127731.html to everyone thinks it 's going swimmingly : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/04/two-thirds-believe-britain-is-on-the-right-track-following-brexi/ although at leas the telegraph provides a useful poll result :  while 81 per cent said that continuing to pay into the eu budget would not represent a true brexit and 79 per cent said the same when it came to allowing new foreign nationals the right to live and work in the uk freely . 
  but honestly i 've just started ignoring the repeated polls that come out . 
   but it kind of seems silly not to just take the extra eu stuff and have more influence seeing as we are here and it makes no sense that we give up a pretty powerful voice in the eu . 
  perhaps `` detested '' is too strong a word but that extra eu stuff you 're talking about is the political integration which the public is not attached to and , like all nation building ideas , is a concept that requires irrational attachment to an idea of europea `` ness '' . 
  however , i respect your position if you are in favour of the further political integration necessary to maintain our influence : i.e. 
  membership of federal core europe . 
   as said it 's a bit fishy that these are just `` white '' countries seems like it 's a bit dishonest to say `` commonwealth '' when what they mean is other anglo countries . 
  no more fishy than allowing european migrants over others because we have being `` european '' in common . 
  i mean all eu members are white majorities right ? 
  it 's not like they intend to exclude the sizeable ethnic minorities of those anglo-countries , citizenship of said countries would be the requirement not a lineage test . 
  not my personal position but the position of those who voted leave . 
  this position is vulnerable to definition due to the general whimsy of the politicians in government who supported brexit . 
  the whole debate over `` soft '' or `` hard '' brexit is the perfect example of how the result is being altered . 
  it 's simply an extension of the original referendum question but dressed up so as to not appear so . 
  `` people could n't possibly have voted for hard brexit '' when despite the economic warnings which a so called `` hard '' brexit would trigger failed to persuade the electorate not to vote leave . 
  hard brexit is simply `` brexit '' while `` soft '' brexit is a renegotiation of membership , something which the government was attempting prior to the referendum and presented as the in choice prior to the referendum . 
  the point of democracy is to encourage public harmony by participation in their system of governance . 
  to be governed by consent and prevent tyranny . 
  if you all desired was prosperity then you could happily live as one of the growing wealthy classes of oligarchic china . 
  you know i 've actually just thought of a more effective way of conveying my message ... the matrix : the difference between living in dystopian future but having individual free will and choice or a safe and stable environment where you are strictly controlled . 
  although this would probably take our conversation beyond the brexit debate towards too much philosophy . 
  well of course it 's shifty ... millions of individual people voted . 
  the confusion over position of `` brexiteers '' ( ugh ) is to be expected as not only is it a broad movement not affiliated with any one party but also because the opposition has been attempting to define their position for them in a flagrant attempt to alter the result in their favour . 
  to the original points : 1 . 
  ** further eu integration was inevitable the moment that the eurozone was created ** : as was intended by its creators . 
  the core integrated eurozone would inevitably dictate eu policy , the so-called tiered eu would result in : 1 . 
  inner more powerful tier of eurozone ( federal eu ) . 
  outer satellite tier ( essentially eea ) . 
  the public is unwilling to join the eurozone and undergo the political integration it requires . 
  thus we would be left in the eea position anyway , the position so detested by pro-eu advocates . 
  therefore the same arguments ( `` seat at the table '' ) that were applied to justify our entry into the ecc would applied to joining the eurozone/federal eu which i would n't put past our current or future leaders . 
  ** in fairness i said commonwealth realms ** because i was accounting for the countries that people are actually talking about when they refer to the commonwealth . 
  on the matter of increased immigration from commonwealth countries , i think it likely that unrestricted immigration would only be supported for canada , new zealand , and australia . 
  ** on immigration as a whole ** , the argument of fairness has been made in regards to non-eu commonwealth countries ( like pakistan/india ) and european/eu countries receiving the same scrutiny in regards to immigration . 
  naturally it 's hard to present a uniform idea of what immigration people want as some want none-full stop , others want limited immigration and some want free movement with commonwealth realms ( as mentioned above ) or a combo of the 1st or 2nd with the 3rd . 
  i think the only thing they all agree on is that they want control over immigration policy . 
  if you want make sense of it think of it in the same way that europeans are against more immigration from outside the eu but are keen on intra-eu immigration . 
  the difference is how those two groups are viewed , one is viewed as the `` one of us '' and the other is not . 
  this is the same for those who favour closer ties/more immigration to and from the commonwealth realms ( specifically australia , canada , new zealand ) but less immigration from the eu and outside it . 
  ** your additions ** : 1 . 
  this makes sense in the traditional sense that the closer power is to the people the more accountable those who wield it are but we could really do with a more clearly defined federalist model in the uk , that kind of bleeds into your 4th point . 
  agreed but the deals we make wo n't be non-beneficial for us , the argument will be over whether we would have got * more * beneficial deals as part of the eu . 
  it 's an argument over whether we would do better not whether we would do well . 
  this is a divisive issue and again reflects the diversity of the out camp ( the remain camp is also diverse in opinion ranging from the eu fanatics to the economically cautious and plain disinterested ) , for eurosceptics like corbyn ( lol ) ttip is the devil and prevents the creation of a socialist utopia in the uk ( tony benn also leant towards this in regards to the whole eu ) while for those that support your 2nd point ttip is something they want to pursue , ( daniel hannan and maybe jacob rees-mogs ) . 
  i think political reform may result in an attempt to maintain unity across the uk ( perhaps some sort of federal convention ) but it wo n't happen during the negotiations because we all know the markets do n't need the kind of instability that large scale political reforms engender . 
  what we need is a constitutional convention but we 've long lacked leaders with actual vision rather than caretakers . 
  put very succinctly . 
  if you had to choose between democracy and prosperity which would you choose ? 
  disclaimer : i 'm in no way saying or suggesting that the eu is undemocratic , i 'm not one of those eussr guys . 
  i 'm just to give an example of when the most sensible economic choice may not be chosen . 
  of course , but then opinions are bound to differ amongst millions of people . 
  my main point was that the establishment and a large part of the populace are still attached to the dictum `` it 's the economy , stupid '' that they are misreading the public and will likely continue to do so , not just in the uk but globally . 
  well i ca n't speak for all leave voters but the political side can be summarised as such ( in no particular order ) : 1 . 
  unwillingness to undergo any more political integration or indeed undo the current level of political integration .
