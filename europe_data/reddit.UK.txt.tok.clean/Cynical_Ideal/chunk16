  a reorientation of british foreign policy towards commonwealth realms . 
  immigration control ( not my interest but a big factor for a lot ) this is a poor summary and i 'm sure i 'm missing some but you get the general gist . 
  i 've been reading some older literature on the british european question and i think paul einzig captures it best :  `` they want to remain purely british and are firmly opposed to relinquishing any essential part of their country 's absolute sovereignty . 
  if it appeared to be likely that genuine and lasting political integration would be brought about by the success of the attempt at economic integration through the common market experiment , britain would be faced with a dilemma whether it would be worth her while , for the sake of such prospects , to give up all hope of recovering british national greatness with the aid of restoration of closer relations with the loyal countries of the commonwealth . '', 
  sure , although in fairness some did suggest that there would be short term economic pain but they were willing to suffer for long term benefits ( economic or otherwise ) . 
  i mean this line :  we secretly all love and admire the brits and therefore feel personally betrayed . 
  may not be strictly true for all european nations , france in particular . 
  do n't think too much about it , it is mostly humorous in intention . 
  this . 
  this is the answer . 
  although i 'm not sure that that 2nd line applies to all ... * cough * france * cough *, 
  [ you must be new here ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/207/234/you-must-be-new-here-willy-wonka.jpg ), 
   this is the bottom line here . 
  we have very little to gain , almost everything to loose and no bargaining position . 
  economically ? 
  probably not but then brexit was a political decision not an economic one . 
  a factor that the remain campaign and those that voted for them are still failing to understand . 
  you 're probably not going to get a great reception here for this opinion . 
  they 're just a little shy of the keen hatred of the uk that the denizens of r/unitedkingdom possess at the moment . 
  does everyone include nations outside the eu ? 
  read some posts around here or better yet take yourself over to r/unitedkingdom . 
  they 've completely lost it since the referendum . 
  it will be but the narrative plays differently . 
  uk = facist hellhole . 
  eu = enlightenment dream in fairness , the uk could do with a health does of federalism but the type of eu the scots want to join wo n't exist soon enough so it puts them in a difficult position . 
  uk here , under those conditions we 'd gladly give it to you . 
  you just expressed the exact point of view that led me to vote leave . 
  just another article where the essential point is that they do n't want brexit to happen . 
  you 're not going to get a good reception for this here or probably a lot of reddit subs . 
  including r/unitedkingdom but then reddit is n't particularly representative of real world views . 
  have n't you visited a scotland thread in r/europe before ? 
  what puzzles me is that the catalonians do n't get the same level of support . 
  i suppose the answer depends on how much you dislike the english . 
  i thought a recent poll showed no change in opinion ? 
  i do n't think the result would change in a re-run . 
  if anything the more brexit is delayed or seen to be ignored the more likely it is that the public would become increasingly negative towards the government . 
  must we be pedantic ? 
  would you rather i said scotland was governed by scottish nationalists ? 
  would that alter my point ? 
  i do n't know why you feel sorry for the former . 
  they were helping us fuck everyone else over , and mighty good they were at it . 
   of course that would n't appeal to ** scotland ** or ireland you mean that country currently governed by the scottish ** national ** party ? 
  the only part of `` english populist nonsense '' scottish nationalists do n't like is the english part . 
  do we get the cool uniforms and competent generals this time ? 
  and that should be confirmed to be the case before negotiations . 
  of course , i was chiming in not trying to put you down . 
  for me it 's just british  human/earthling . 
  i do n't particularly need the middle step . 
  yes , it kind of is . 
  if one thought that the eu would benefit from encouraging what would essentially be sedition ( before a 2nd scottish referendum grants legitimate independence ) in a member of the un security council , a cornerstone of the western alliance , and currently the eu 's ally then yes you could argue it might be in the interest of the eu . 
  this is not even accounting for the extra damage done to the markets by the added instability of scottish independence , on top of the current brexit woes . 
  i do n't think any of the european leaders particularly look forward to uk disintegration . 
  that 's alright mate , tense times . 
  no , no , a simple misunderstanding . 
  my only point was that the uk , while attempting some meagre federalism/devolution , was still vastly more integrated than the uk is within the eu . 
  but you agree on the important point ? 
  that it would n't be easier than brexit ? 
  then what are we quibbling about ? 
  why bother noting the drift if you did n't think it would make scottish secession easier ? 
  another comment line added to the long list of reddit tangents . 
  this is very simple . 
  how much is the uk integrated into the eu ? 
  how much is scotland integrated into the uk ? 
  how difficult is it for the uk to exit the eu ? 
  so far , according to commentators , quite difficult ( british understatement at play ) . 
  how difficult will it be for scotland to exit the uk ? 
  definitely not easier than the uk exiting the eu . 
  that 's a drifting apart of social opinions and political ideology not legal , military , administrative , diplomatic etc. 
  integration . 
  you 're dreaming if you imagine scottish secession from the uk will be any easier than brexit . 
  no , it 's still a leap . 
  if you think it 's difficult to extricate ourselves from 40 years of integration into the eu , try extricating yourself from 300 years of integration . 
  you 're free to believe what you want , friend . 
  i just happen to disagree that i have more in common with say a bulgarian , hungarian , italian etc. 
  then i do with a nigerian or a jamaican etc. 
  ( excluding the obvious canadians , australians etc. ) . 
  that 's not to say that the examples i 've mentioned above are like aliens but i do n't particularly feel like i 'm * more * similar to them than anyone else . 
  by similar you mean white right ? 
  and people called the leavers racist . 
  if there 's no curry then i 'm not interested . 
  perhaps , but then i think the union 's been dead since snp swept the board in the last ge . 
  if the continuation of our union is dependant on the continuation of another then it is no union at all . 
  lol , it looks like they 've cut scotland off the top there . 
   finally , one of the most problematic members of the eu is out , if the eu is the institutional mess that it is , it is also because of the british . 
  we 're just your bogeyman are n't we ? 
   and now i will be happy to use the second official language of ireland as a common language , i see no problem with that . 
   was it not alright to use it as a common language before ? 
  obvious joke aside . 
  thank you , kind sir . 
  if the people of gibraltar want it then go for it . 
  if i had to express it in one word , curious . 
  forget building that us-mexico wall , let 's build a bridge . 
  an atlantic bridge . 
  honestly ? 
  kinda ... ... 
  the sky is worryingly bright now . 
  man , i should get some sleep . 
  scotland may leave and rejoin the eu in a couple of years so you 'd only have to wait for a bit . 
  oh , i meant a militant england invading all the home nations in the fashion of cromwell 's period . 
  and that 's your prerogative to do but no one is compelled to use their vote for anything other than to voice their own opinion .
