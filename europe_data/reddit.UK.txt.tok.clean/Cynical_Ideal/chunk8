  realistically , that 's not going to happen . 
  why the fuck is a copy of the article being down voted ? 
  i do n't think we 'd instantly get a trade deal with the us , it would probably take years like most do , but at the * back * of the queue ? 
  come on barrack , let 's not be spiteful . 
  no , you definitely should . 
  perhaps if i had used european it would have come off as less hostile . 
  his proxy , le pen , is working on his behalf . 
  my god , irony of a hungarian doing a better job at arguing for brexit than the official leave campaign . 
  is n't this what the whole brexit debate is about ? 
  the british public never wanted to be a part of a federal use and want to avoid becoming a part of one now . 
  so naturally comparisons with the us would n't aid that argument . 
  are they though ? 
  do you have any source or polling which would indicate the feeling of those countries towards us inclusion ? 
  i know that there was a poll a month back or so which showed very high support for free movement between the uk , ca , aus and nz but i ca n't recall if an opinion on the us was offered . 
  i would n't say that anti-americanism is incredibly prevalent in these countries , yes it is present but certainly not widespread . 
  if there is a lack of enthusiasm for including the us ( which i do n't know is the case ) then that probably lies in the size disparity between the us and the other nations . 
  there is already some hostility towards including the uk and we 're only around 60 + million not 320 million . 
  beyond that anti-americanism being more prevalent amongst the anglosphere rather than south east asia ( again if that really is the case ) would be due to the fact that those se asia countries are in a dangerous environment , under threat from a larger neighbour in a similar manner to eastern europe . 
  the anglosphere nations probably do n't feel the same way . 
  regardless , even with the us outside such an ( entirely theoretical and unlikely organisation ) they would still be allied . 
  these nations are n't suddenly going to turn on the us . 
  the hopes of re-embracing the us back into the british fold were different from the desire to draw the us into wwii to help gain victory . 
  by ww2 significant british figures knew we were too weak to defend the empire from both the germans and japanese and needed the us to aid us . 
  in return we subordinated ourselves , this would n't have been done if we did n't have to , no nation would voluntarily hand over control of its sphere . 
  this viewpoint from obama is unsurprising . 
  no leader would be supportive of a separatist movement in a allied organisation , especially one which might disrupt the world infrastructure set up by the us . 
  however , i think the us administration is making a mistake in encouraging the uk to stay if their aim is to have an influential partner on the inside . 
  if it is simply to encourage stability and prevent the unravelling of the eu then obama 's position makes perfect sense but they are fundamentally misunderstanding the eu and the uk 's relationship with it . 
  the uk has been losing influence for a while now due in no small part to self-induced isolation within the eu but also because the eurozone will inevitably form the core of the eu ( if it does n't collapse but that 's a whole different ball game ) . 
  now i 'm sure that obama would encourage us to join the euro , or any other similar political projects , but the public simply is n't behind this and probably never will be so this problem will only grow larger . 
  our detached status will continue to become more distant and i wish obama ( and his administration ) would realise the inevitability of this outcome . 
  ** tldr : ** obama wants the uk to stay to ensure the us has a strong ally influencing the eu but this influence will only decline as the eurozone integrates and the uk ( backed by the public ) refuses to . 
  let 's just get this over with now rather than 5 years down the line . 
  christ , that 's grim . 
  for the sake of clarity `` resurrecting the empire '' = closer relations with australia , canada and new zealand , right ? 
  i 'm not sure how our public would react to including us in that theoretical grouping , varies between the people who would be quite pro ( flood migration to california ) and the passionate anti-american imperialists ( left wing mostly ) . 
  if all the publics of the the four countries mentioned above were n't keen on including the us would it still be hostile ? 
  if it was n't just the british keeping them out ? 
  i know what you mean about the invitation part ( numerous poets , novelists and politicians asking for more us pro-activity both pre and post wwi and ii ) but there was also a small part of pushing the uk off the top as we were teetering . 
  humorous analogy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtyoqpaf5hu, 
  i do n't think the uk would get far but i was just curious whether you thought the us administration considered such a direction for the uk undesired . 
  like if ( and this is entirely theoretical no basis in economic/political reality ) the uk and canada did try to strengthen relations would the us actually try to fuck us . 
   brexit will impact the eu directly , via removing a large , well-to-do , militarily-powerful country with a well-functioning economy . 
  ** it will create a potential rival or competitor well down the road . 
  ** it will establish a route out of the eu . 
  brexit is n't good news for an influential eu down the road . 
  wait , are you talking about the uk becoming a rival/competitor to the us or the eu ? 
  would you say that part of the us support for the uk 's eu integration is to prevent the uk taking a more pro-active role in the anglosphere ? 
  sounds unlikely to me . 
   that said , if they try to cut us out of the equation afterwards & integrate the rest of the anglosphere without us , especially in the context of canada , thus basically trying to isolate & fuck us geopolitically in our own back yard , than yeah , we 're not going to tolerate that & they 'll regret not trying to include us . 
  lol it 's all about fighting over canada , we want our snow son back . 
  although , on a serious point do you think that part of the reason the us is keen on the uk integrating into the eu to prevent the uk attempting a stronger role in the anglosphere ? 
  you 're still misunderstanding . 
  to make the eu more united requires the emotional attachment that i 've been talking about . 
  the emotional attachment that makes one loyal to his family , his city , his nation etc. 
  why is the eurozone in crisis ? 
  simply put because germans ( and others ) do n't want to pay for the greeks ( and others ) . 
  why do n't they want to do this ? 
  why will a saxon pay for a berliner ( or vice versa ) or a londoner pay for a cumbrian ? 
  because ( generally ) they feel part of the same group , the same `` family '' , the same nation . 
  this feeling is fostered by all the things i have mentioned in previous posts to create a national identity ( civic or ethnic ) . 
  the eu requires the same thing for unity to be achieved , a sense of `` togetherness '' to weather and overcome the crises which currently overwhelms it . 
  a laudable goal but far from the reality of what the eu currently embodies and what it will require . 
  for the eurozone to survive emotion is required for rich countries to be willing to transfer wealth to poorer nations , to hamstring themselves . 
  emotion is required to convince all eu members to share the burden of the migrants . 
  emotion is required to convince all to reign in russian aggression and tackle islamic terrorism . 
  the sense that there is an `` us '' or a `` we '' . 
  that is the nature of human social groups . 
  by building a federal union or indeed a country based upon pragmatism and rationality you are building a ship for calm waters that will brake apart in a storm . 
  yes , but they risk ( pun intended ) also coming off as trying to scare the british public . 
  they 've emphasised that there is no status quo with remain , which is true , but they 've gone too overboard with emphasising the evil eu superstate . 
  we can not be compelled to join such an organisation without the consent of our leaders . 
  the main flaw of the leave campaign is still a lack of a compelling vision for the uk post exit . 
  something beyond a singapore of the north . 
  i do n't say that it is a negative thing only that these elements are often important when crafting a common identity . 
  who can say how nationalistic a eu federation would be but certainly it would be nationalistic to some degree , as required for solidarity . 
  one could argue that many eu federalists are quite nationalistic already . 
  again i do not say that is a bad thing only that it is n't a * new * thing or something more enlightened than the national sentiment which constructs current nation states . 
  chris grayling made a good summary of the position we face on a news night episode last week which needs to be emphasised more heavily by the leave campaign : that the eurozone needs to essentially become a federal state to survive and therefore we 'll be faced with the option of joining this core group , staying in the outer rim and becoming a satellite nation or leaving now and trying to diversify our politics and economy to help lessen the influence this block may have . 
  well , in fairness we have seen a swing towards remain in the last couple of polls so clearly fear is an effective weapon . 
  that and the leave campaign is making a mistake by allowing the debate to be dominated by economics . 
  no , you 're still misunderstanding what i 'm saying . 
  let me try and make it clearer : ** 1 ) ** to create a federal europe requires a common european identity . 
  this is necessary to solve the problems of the eurozone and others . 
  ** 2 ) ** to create this identity the eu would use , and is attempting to use , the same methods which fostered national identities : ideas of common history ; common culture ; shared values ; an external other to identify against etc. 
  the eu is n't something new in that regard , its simply changed who is `` us '' and who is `` them '' . 
  again , in a similar manner to the previous poster i was debating with , you seem to be missing my point . 
  i was n't using the soviet union or empires to highlight their methods for unification nor to make any allusions to the eussr memes/jokes/insults that are thrown about . 
  i used them to highlight multiethnic organisations which were still belligerent and operating on the same principals as nation states . 
  the usa for example is quite nationalistic/patriotic , more so than some european nations , and still operates on the basis of what is best for the american people . 
  in the same way the eu is working primarily for the benefit of european citizens ( kind of ) but not for the benefit of all mankind . 
  i do not say this is bad but hardly a movement towards world unification . 
  like you said in an earlier reply , a federal europe would certainly be beneficial for those who are members in terms of economic and political might but for those nations/peoples outside it will simply be another power vying with other powers . 
  you 're right to criticise my use of `` progressive '' but you 're definition of the eu being a `` step up '' could be applied to any of the larger organised blocks of history . 
  like i 've said before did the formation of the usa mark a step towards global unity ? 
  did the formation of the soviet union ? 
  the empires of european nations ? 
  what i 'm trying to say is that you may see the eu as a foundation stone for global unity but to me it seems more like another player in the `` great game '' , or at least an organisation that wants to be . 
  the language used by pro-federalists in their justification of a use in couched in the same terms a nation state would use : safety in numbers against external threats ( russia , china and usa ) . 
  this goes even further when we consider the idea of the `` european '' union and the limits of its expansion .
