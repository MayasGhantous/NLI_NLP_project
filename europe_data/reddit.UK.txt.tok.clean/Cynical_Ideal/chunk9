  already , we are deciding where the borders of the eu lies , which nations are `` european '' enough to warrant their inclusion . 
  that does n't sound like global unity to me . 
  again , i 'm not saying that wanted a federal europe is a bad thing , not at all , but i am disputing the idea that it is a more enlightened idea than the current nation state model which it would mimic but on a larger scale . 
  true but in fairness every party has climate change sceptics . 
  sure and there 's nothing wrong with having such a dream but my point was that proponents of said organisation are no more progressive than the nationalists they disparage . 
  yeah i know , i was joking . 
  you 're quite right . 
  i shall not edit it but leave it there as a mark of shame . 
  it varies depending upon the person but to put it concisely : ** 1 ) ** ** anti-political eu ** : the british public are n't in favour of any of the political aspects of the eu and the idea of `` ever closer union '' . 
  now , naturally we are n't in the euro or schengen nor could we be forced to join a use but eventually such a entity will exist around the eurozone so we will have to deal with this issue eventually . 
  some think that by cutting ties now we can move away from this federalised europe and reduce its influence on us . 
  ** 2 ) ** ** immigration ** : this has been a bugbear before the refugee crisis , which just exacerbated the issue due to irrational fear . 
  the actual immigration issues that the british public have are to do with eu migrants , not syrians ( although i 'm sure they are n't the most welcome either ) , who have been arriving in the uk in greater numbers since the start of the euro crisis . 
  it 's still debated whether they are a boon in terms of propping up the nhs ( favourite line ) and other vital skilled jobs or just depreciating wages for the working class and putting too much pressure on schools/infrastructure etc. 
  i agree with what you 're saying but i feel as if we are talking past each other . 
  my commentary has n't been concerned with whether the eu is some evil empire or dictatorship but that it contains or wants/needs to create the same aspects of the nation state but on a larger scale . 
  thus i deem it no more progressive than the nation state it seeks to replace . 
  nor all pro-eu federalists any more progressive than their nationalist opponents . 
  you 'll notice i also included the british empire , the uk , the usa and a united germany in my list of examples . 
  the use of the austro-hungarian empire and the soviet union was n't some underhand jab at the eu over transparency or democratic deficits ( i find the eussr stuff very dull ) but part of my commentary on the social dynamics necessary to create and maintain these blocks . 
  yes , the eu allows members to leave ( so does the uk albeit in a less codified form ) but for those outside the block such as russia , usa and china the eu ( and eu federalist supporters ) are just as antagonistic as any regular nationalist . 
  the arguments are quite common place . 
  `` how can we prevent ourselves being bullied by china/usa/russia if we are n't united ? '', 
   in uk or generally in eu ? 
  generally in the eu . 
  note i use the word * generally * . 
   it 's walking in that direction . 
  sure in the same way that the austrian hungarian empire was walking in that direction ; the soviet union was walking in that direction ; that the british empire was walking in that direction ; the us ; or arguably any larger nation in history . 
  with that mindset you could argue that any amalgamation of smaller tribes/communities into a larger organisation could be seen as a step towards world unity but that does n't prevent those larger units being just as nationalist/tribalistic as the groups they were composed of . 
  indeed that feeling is necessary to create a cohesive group that can act in a unified fashion . 
  the unification of great britain did n't prevent war with other nations or any less nationalistic feeling ; the unification of the german states did n't discard nationalism it simply created/emphasised a new one . 
  the same is being attempted with the eu because it is necessary to create the federal state that the eurozone requires . 
  could the eu eventually be part of a unified global body ? 
  perhaps in the far flung future but before that it will be just as belligerent and `` nationalistic '' as it 's contemporary nation state rivals , i.e. 
  china , russia , america , brazil etc. 
  of course it depends on perspective but then i do n't believe that pro-eu/federalists are any less patriotic/nationalistic or more internationalist than the nationalists they detest . 
  they 're not discarding the tribalistic system we have but simply enlarging the size of the tribe . 
  hence why we have all these attempts to provide a commonality between the citizens of eu members . 
  attempts at creating a joint identity , solidarity . 
  solidarity against russian imperialism ; against american dominance ; against chinese ascension ; against islamic aggression . 
  i do n't find anything particularly wrong with the above but i do have a problem with the pretence that the eu is some enlightened post-nationalistic concept . 
  interestingly farage and le pen have come to the same end from different beginnings . 
  farage is an anti-eu campaigner who utilises the immigration debate because it furthers his agenda against the eu . 
  le pen is a an anti-immigration campaigner who came to the anti-eu debate as an extension of her initial focus . 
  both are nationalists/patriots but that does n't make them worse than their pro-eu opponents . 
  short answer = ukip is n't far right . 
  long answer = ukip is seen as toxic by some brits but only in the sense that they have a couple of loons ( homosexual weather guy etc. ), 
  and are a one issue party ( eu ) which gets tiring after a while . 
  furthermore , ukip does n't have any of the historical baggage that fn ( or its former leader ) has in regards to anti-semeticism . 
  fortunately ukip has taken a backseat to the eurosceptic conservatives . 
  proof that marine le pen is a double agent for the eu . 
  why else would she try and sabotage the leave campaign by associating it with fn , which most brits think of as far right . 
  i 'm not sure cameron could be trusted to negotiate a deal that did n't resemble eea membership . 
  for the eurozone members it 's not a matter of choice , they require the economic and political integration that the euro engenders . 
  if the uk votes to stay eventually , in the near future , we will likely have another referendum after significant constitutional changes have occurred in the eu . 
  unless we we wholeheartedly decide to embrace eu integration . 
  the choice of english does n't have much to do with ireland being a member of the eurozone or the uk being a member of the eu . 
  english is the global lingua franca and the common language between most eu citizens . 
  another irritating brit poster checking in . 
  well glossing over the traditional arguments that many have mentioned such as : 1 ) island mentality . 
  2 ) history of ( continental ) isolationism . 
  4 ) distrust of political projects . 
  i believe that the key reasons for british scepticism of european integration , and lack of appreciation for the eu as a whole , is due to the nature of globalisation today and the position of the uk after ww2 , respectively . 
  after the second world war the uk was one of the few , if not only , european nations that had n't been occupied/defeated or , in some other cases , suffered political upheaval resulting in a dictatorship . 
  therefore the emotional appeal of the eu on the basis of guaranteeing peace and democracy does n't hold the same weight as it would in other eu members . 
  we have n't experienced the same turbulent and unstable history as most continental nations did before the formation of the eu . 
  most people do n't feel that they need the eu to be a successful democracy or to guarantee human rights . 
  essentially , the uk learnt a different lesson compared to the rest of the continent from ww2 . 
  the other less historical reason for british euroscepticism , and more important in my opinion , is that we simply do n't feel as isolated and vulnerable as many eu members do . 
  i know this will sound like some variant of british exceptionalism but the globalised world , championed by the usa , is one where the uk 's culture is quite comfortable . 
  english becoming the lingua franca and the influence of american culture on the whole world has made it a lot more accessible to the uk : the blending of american and british culture is also extensive . 
  furthermore the presence of other english speaking nations such as canada ( let 's forget quebec ) , australia and new zealand also contributes to our lack of global isolation . 
  if anything those nations exacerbate the feeling that we 're isolating ourselves from this comfortable setting by being in the eu , regardless of whether that is true or not . 
  when the remain campaign says we need to band together to stand up to china or russia or the usa ( although most do n't view the us as a rival/enemy ) we think that the principle is probably sound but have doubts about why we should `` group up '' ( so to speak ) with the eu members in particular . 
  when the argument is made that the eu represents a move away from a primitive nationalist mindset it seems confusing as the eu seems to aim to create a larger transnational block rather than being particularly internationalist . 
  otherwise why would numerous arguments for european integration rely upon protecting ourselves from these other world powers that would seek to harm us ? 
  are we supposed to be convinced that we share more in common with a latvian/bulgarian/german / greek etc. 
  than with an australian/canadian or a south african ? 
  i 'm not trying to be offensive or anything just attempting to give an insight into an aspect of british euroscepticism . 
  although , someone will undoubtably disagree and offer other reasons . 
  it certainly gives a sense of the inevitability of this debate and how little has changed . 
  russia was n't even a proper bogeyman to a lot of western europeans , even when ukraine was at the height of media coverage there was a great deal of indifference to russia 's actions . 
  the refugees have only reached that height because they directly affect a lot of nations and even then the action taken has been ineffective . 
  i mean really , the eu members could n't decide to put out a fire even if their legs were aflame . 
  probably a bit of hyperbole true but when the gentleman above me says it 's sad for the ukrainians but not our problem i can only laugh in despair at indifference to a conflict right on europe 's doorstep . 
  if it 's not a doomed continent then perhaps it deserves to be with such indifference and inactivity . 
  truly , what a doomed continent , and this is coming from a brit . 
  seems a bit harsh to the ukrainians . 
  seems they are going through all this shit for nothing . 
  yes because intervention has been shown to * never * work . 
  stabilising the volatile region which currently surrounds it . 
  you know , the conflicts that are causing millions of refugees to enter europe and the increasing rise of fundamentalist islam . 
  by some accounts thatcher was prepared to do just that the last time and had to be talked down . 
  mao let the side down . 
  no one cared who stalin was until he put on the moustache . 
  the eurasian union might make it too confusing . 
  there was quite a bit of tea in boston harbour that interested members of this agreement . 
  think about what you 've done !, 
  we already have a moat ... 
  only on a quid pro quo basis .
