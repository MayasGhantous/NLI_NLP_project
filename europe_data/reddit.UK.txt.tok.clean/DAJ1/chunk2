  [ here 's ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/08/26/one-five-say-uk-should-not-admit-single-migrant-tu/ ) the full article which has info about what brits would consider ( un ) important for immigrants ( education level , english proficiency etc. 
  i guess he forgot to go to the museums . 
  reminds me of [ brass eye 's take ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoueaulweae ) on the [ uk policy of banning sinn f\u00e9in members voices from broadcast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988%e2%80%9394_british_broadcasting_voice_restrictions ) , which just resulted in all interviews on tv being dubbed by actors . 
  not surprised he was turned away , music festivals know they 're targets and have beefed up security massively . 
  the one i went to this year went from a simple check of your wristband , to a full on pat-down and metal-detectors setup . 
  it also made it much easier for schools to identify students outside of school grounds . 
  swear every month or so the school would send letters out about people in our uniform causing mischief somewhere nearby . 
  yeah , i could n't really think of anything else . 
  we 're blessed by nice buildings . 
  a lot of people dislike [ mann island ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fpfrbdvcttm/uwmgpjeioei/aaaaaaaaedk/ad3yepvu-vu/s1600/mann+island.jpg ) , but i love that giant black shard . 
  ** liverpool ** most people would probably say the [ liver building ] ( https://markroddis.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_0574.jpg ) , but i 've always much preferred the [ port of liverpool building ] ( https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/cms/wp-content/uploads/legacy-assets/images/nov_08/pnw__1226921046_port_of_liverpool_building.jpg ) . 
  tbh though , all of the [ three graces ] ( http://www.accommodationengine.co.uk/files/cityguide/full/liverpool2.jpg ) look nice . 
  i have a bit of a thing for the [ albert dock ] ( http://www.albertdock.com/wp-content/themes/albert/img/hero.jpg ) as well , though i do n't know if it counts as one building . 
  for ugliest i 'd probably say the [ liverpool metropolitan cathedral ] ( https://pcolman.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/paddys-wigwam.jpg ) , the catholic cathedral in liverpool and affectionately known as paddy 's wigwam . 
  though , to be fair to it , the [ interior ] ( http://www.formidablephotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/paddys-wigwam.jpg ) is actually quite nice . 
  being honest though , liverpool quite fortunately does n't have many * awful * buildings , the bad ones are generally boring or dilapidated , as opposed to a lot of the ones mentioned in this thread which are just * bad * concepts . 
   there are a lot of hideous buildings but i really hate the engineering building which is funny because architects love it . 
  that 's a building only an architect could love . 
  it 's almost like the ending to a fucking sitcom . 
  our main character , dave , walks into downing street for the last time and as he closes the door , the show 's the song plays . 
  absolutely bizarre . 
  no luck catching them kangaroos then ? 
  all major political parties , leaders of the parties , ex-prime-ministers , banks and financial institutions etc. 
  supported the eu . 
  to many who feel disenfranchised , a vote against the eu was a vote against the establishment . 
  yes , it likely will make them worse off but in their eyes , seeing all the chaos and heads-rolling in westminster is reward enough . 
  i believe that ` spoiler ' is from season 2 . 
  but they do lack popular appeal . 
  he constantly performs badly in polling and in my personal opinion he 's been very poor in a year that should have been easy for him , the tories are weak and he 's been far too passive when he should be on the attack . 
  i think a lot of people are misunderstanding this . 
  they are not blocking brexit or overturning the referendum , they are saying that they will seek to rejoin the eu if they are elected in the next general election ( probably not for a few years ) . 
  it 's potentially quite a good move , i doubt it will alienate all but the very smallest amount of current lib dem voters but as a centrist , pro-eu party they might be able to pinch quite a few votes off the pro-eu side of the tories and possibly quite a few votes off labour if corbyn actually goes public with his support of brexit instead of pretending to like the eu . 
  can merseyside just secede and join ireland ? 
  we 've been flirting with it for the past 150 years , might as well just use the opportunity . 
  liverpool . 
   `` we do not want to find ourselves concentrating all the limited cash that may have to be made available into liverpool and having nothing left for possibly more promising areas such as the west midlands or , even , the north east . 
   `` it would be even more regrettable if some of the brighter ideas for renewing economic activity were to be sown only on relatively stony ground on the banks of the mersey . 
   `` i can not help feeling that the option of managed decline is one which we should not forget altogether . 
  we must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill . '', 
  for example of the effects of the eu , here is the albert dock [ before ] ( https://asenseofplaceblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/silted-up1.jpg ) the eu helped , and [ afterwards ] ( http://www.albertdock.com/wp-content/themes/albert/img/hero.jpg ) . 
  really quite worried about this . 
  before eu intervention , the uk government 's official policy for my city was to just let it die detroit-style . 
  hopefully we have the momentum to keep us alive but i think that 's our entire start-up industry gone overnight . 
  this is not so much a referendum about the eu , and more a referendum about the establishment . 
  a large amount of leave voters are angry about establishment politics , stagnant wages , urban decay , lack of government spending and a neglectful political parties who have taken their areas to be ` safe ' and ignorable , they are treating the eu as an embodiment of the establishment and punishing it . 
  in general elections it 's establishment vs. establishment , in the referendum they have a ` fuck off establishment option ' and they are using it . 
  it 's no surprise leave is doing well in ` forgotten ' areas of the uk such as the north east . 
  temporary work for the night . 
  my mate 's a uni student getting paid ~ # 120 for the night as a counter . 
  the mail on sunday actually came out in support of remain yesterday . 
  i think the mail has been following the tory party-line of `` blame everything bad on the eu to distract from our own problems '' for years and now that the uk might actually leave it 's panicking . 
  adverts was perhaps the wrong word - messages might be more suitable . 
  in particular , juncker 's made a number of statements that have given fuel to the us vs. 
  them fire . 
  honestly , speaking as a brit this is possibly one of the best ` remain ' adverts i 've seen from the eu ( and its members ) . 
  it seems ridiculous , but all of the threats and warnings had a tendency to put ` leave ' voters on edge , they saw it as bullying and hostility from the continent and it pushed them away . 
  though this does n't really say a lot , it is a much more positive , ego-stroking message from the continent which will be received pretty well . 
  i do n't know how effective it will actually be to convince people to change their mind but it will foster some much-needed good-will . 
  a proper english breakfast definitely has black pudding , but this may just be a northern thing . 
  my trip to brussels in a week and a half sure is looking eventful . 
   i think that the countries are simply too different politically to work in a union . 
  you could say the same about pretty much anywhere in the uk . 
  wales and the north are probably closer to scotland politically than the south but it 's just something you have to deal with . 
  i think you 're getting downvoted because people think you 're serious . 
  shame , if this was extended a few years we could probably get almost the whole of england in there , what with the flooding in [ yorkshire ] ( https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1477893/york-floods.jpg ) and the [ lake district ] ( https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1473980/cumbria-floods.jpg ) . 
  the school i went to when i was younger used to have these yearly trips to an orphanage in south africa , taking dozens of students to volunteer for a few weeks in the summer . 
  of course the flights there and back were expensive , as was the four-star hotel that they liked to stay in for the few weeks they were over there . 
  the bill for this trip would usually run into the tens-of-thousands , partly paid for by the school , partly paid for by individual fundraising . 
  of course , instead of just straight-up giving this large amount of money to the orphanage , the tens-of-thousands of pounds would instead be used to ferry over thirty or so middle-class teenagers who would perform poor-quality manual labour for a few weeks before swanning off back home with a new profile picture featuring some african kids . 
  i do n't really know where i 'm going with this , but the point is that people care more about looking like they 've helped people than actually helping them . 
  originally intended as a short term fix for a lack of trains back in 1980 , with a maximum lifespan of 20 years , the pacer is still in use today throughout the uk . 
  the trains are made out of modified busses with four wheels instead of the usual eight , this leads to very loud and bumpy journeys and severely limits the speed that the train can travel . 
  they 're fucking shite . 
  what ? 
  he 's talking about the 2002 referendum in which they voted 99 % to stay in the uk . 
  he 's still got his seat . 
  as a bonus , here 's this week 's question time brexit special featuring leading pro and anti eu figures in the uk debating and answering the public 's questions . 
  just do n't read the comments . 
  the ira killed almost 2000 people during the troubles . 
  they phoned in occasionally but not always . 
  a lot of people in this thread seem to be talking about the eu referendum in the comments but judging by the date , i 'm assuming it 's actually the scottish referendum ? 
  anyone know for certain ? 
  its the telegraph live update thing , it changes throughout the day . 
  at the time it was the only non-twitter , non-paywalled place reporting it . 
  i 'll try and find a stable article now . 
  edit 1 : [ here 's the eu bit ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/15/fresh-blow-nicola-sturgeon-57-per-cent-scottish-voters-back/ ), 
  every poll actually overestimated independence by at least 5 % . 
  yougov was one of the closest , giving 49 % to no . 
  it 's a you gov poll , they 're usually the most reliable uk pollsters in my opinion . 
   our populations are already so blended . 
  just about everyone in scotland has family in ruk , we 're in it together on the same bloody island ( well , apart from ni ) whether we like it or not . 
  this is the most important part of the matter to me , i was born and raised in england but i 've got scottish ancestry ( and an extremely scottish name as a result ) , scottish family and went to university in scotland . 
  my case is not unique , scotland is a fundamental part of the uk , its culture , and its people . 
  having scotland leave would destroy my identity far more than brexit did . 
   i would love to have theresa may in my country sweden as stateminister ( pm ) to sort out its mess wow , sweden must be pretty fucked if you want may . 
  i appreciate having these regular cartoon roundups but can we have them from somewhere else ? 
  most of the ones that appear in these articles are fucking terrible . 
  worth noting that copeland ( and its predecessor ) have been labour controlled since 1935 . 
  a better indicator of how embarrassing this is can be found [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/sebastianepayne/status/834959767047110656 ) . 
  this is n't normal .
