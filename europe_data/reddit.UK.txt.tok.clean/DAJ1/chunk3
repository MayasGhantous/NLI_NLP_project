  i 'm not saying brexit is ok . 
  in my comment i said that scottish independence is bad for the same reason brexit is bad . 
  how is that an endorsement of brexit ? 
  and i would agree with you there , which is why i find the attitude of many leave voters to also be ridiculous . 
  yes , but scottish independence hurts scotland . 
  you should n't support a movement that will damage the country that undertakes it . 
  i find it kind of ridiculous that the national can write an article talking about how important unions are and not wanting to break them up after so much shared history whilst vehemently supporting scottish independence . 
  i do n't think people on / r/europe realise that scottish independence is just miniature brexit and it 's ridiculous to argue about how terrible the uk leaving the eu is and then fail to notice that you 're using the same arguments for having scotland leave the uk . 
  also , the national is trash and it 's embarrassing how it 's treated like a serious newspaper by this subreddit . 
  `` uk bad , everyone else good . '', 
  - / r/europe 's unofficial motto, 
  does anyone else find most of the cartoons that appear in cartoons of the week to be slightly shit ? 
  way too many of them just fall into the ` label absolutely everything ' genre . 
   he 's a far left relic of the 80s the 80s bit is important here . 
  i always get annoyed when arguing with corbynistas who claim that corbyn is ` real labour ' and ` taking it back to its roots ' when labour has always been a centre-left fabian party ( admittedly left of new labour ) . 
  when labour went this far left in the 80s they were rendered unelectable for over a decade , entire wings of the party split off and joined others . 
  unless corbyn leaves now , labour should expect the same . 
  i think in most places it 's : * 70 % + = first * 60-70 % = 2:1 * 50-60 % = 2:2 * 40-50 % = third * < 40 % = fail, 
  i do n't think it was necessarily a vote against the eu . 
  a lot of people in these disenfranchised areas see westminster and brussels as one and the same , with all major parties and politicians supporting the eu and eu-integration . 
  in their mind it was a vote against westminster as much as a vote against brussels . 
  in fact , if you follow a lot of the brexit discourse in the uk at the moment you 'll find that discussion of the eu has taken a back-foot and people are spending most of their time criticising the government and mps instead . 
   how do you say `` butter '' ? 
  if you think the `` utt '' sound rhymes with `` put , '' then you 're from the north of england . 
  but if you say it with a lighter touch , and the two words sound different , then you 're definitely not a northerner . 
  i 'm really struggling to understand how you can say the `` utt '' sound of `` butter '' and `` put '' differently . 
  anyone able to explain it better ? 
   how do you say `` tongue '' ? 
  if you pronounce the `` g '' then you 're from bolton or preston . 
  everyone else gives it a soft `` ng '' sound . 
  this one too . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljpfzrrd3j8 ) . 
  apart from your native language , how many languages are you fluent/semi-fluent in ? 
   no option for 0 wew , had to just go with 1 . 
  the guy who lost had the largest majority of any tory mp in london and [ apparently labour are also worried by the reaction to brexit in london as well ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dont-underestimate-the-seriousness-of-labours-defeat-in-richmond-park-a7451966.html ) . 
  if both those parties continue to push for brexit , whilst the lib dems oppose it , we could see london become a new liberal democrat heartland . 
  reminds me of the uk . 
  people complain about the anglican church 's links to the state but its made us have the mildest mainstream denomination possible . 
  i 'd rather have that then american-style christianity . 
  i 've always heard eoghan pronounced as owen , never eugene . 
  i swear i 've seen this same photo purported to be from every single country and town in the world . 
  as far as i 'm aware , / r/uk 's policy is that / s tags are for dumb americans . 
  thought / r/europe would agree but i guess not . 
  did n't the same thing happen with totalbiscuit ? 
  had terminal cancer then got better ? 
  i wonder why this is getting downvoted ? 
  he sounds english at the start but as he gets angrier over the video he begins to sound 100 % cypriot . 
  does anyone know who it is ? 
  is this the village from the emmerdale intro ? 
  the jihad stuff does n't seem that bad . 
  from what i understand it 's in religious education class and is about jihad as in the struggle to improve society/help people etc. 
  and not * jihad * jihad . 
  the main reason for the rise in acid attacks is because it 's incredibly easy to get hold of , much harder for police to spot and it does n't kill the victim ( lower sentencing ) . 
  from what i understand , the rise has mostly come from gangs aciding each other instead of stabbing each other . 
   expect this to be downvoted to hell . 
  did you really expect to be downvoted ? 
  these comments have made me realise non-native english speakers use the word ` bathing ' differently to native english speakers . 
  apologies for linking to / r/ukpolitics but twitter submissions are banned and that 's the only place it exists at the moment . 
  oliver twist . 
  these politico-compiled cartoons are always the worst . 
  anyway , [ here 's my favourite cartoon of the week . 
  ] ( https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/methode%2ftimes%2fprod%2fweb%2fbin%2f54300d48-5b6e-11e7-8b02-b735a4dd8be3.jpg ), 
  i 've seen people claiming this but everywhere i 've worked it 's been bank holidays + 28 days . 
  i 've never heard of anyone having to take bank holidays out of their 28 . 
  there 's a big project in liverpool at the moment called [ liverpool waters ] ( http://brightcove04.o.brightcove.com/4221396001/4221396001_5360009157001_5360007592001-vs.jpg?pubid=4221396001&amp;videoid=5360007592001 ) , unfortunately we 're running into problems with unesco who do n't want it built and are threatening to revoke the city 's heritage status if it goes ahead . 
  i thought the new fence would have stopped them ? 
  are they now blockading further back from the tunnel or are they walking all the way around ? 
  not in the uk at least . 
  the old-school ` label everything ' cartoons seemed to die out a long time ago in the mainstream . 
  [ today 's times cartoon for example ] ( https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/methode%2ftimes%2fprod%2fweb%2fbin%2f1eb742dc-4eec-11e7-bd08-02412f81a02e.jpg ) . 
  thank god they labelled her ` may ' and her sword ` general election ' , i 'd have no idea what was happening otherwise . 
  unless you go at peak times such as straight before or after work then the polling stations normally only have a couple of people there . 
  voting is very quick/efficient and there 's loads of polling stations everywhere . 
  iirc , you only pay more back than under the old system if you earn over about # 70k . 
  there are six instances of civilisation being ` invented ' somewhere ( for lack of a better term ) : the nile delta , mesopotamia , the yangtze river , and the indus valley . 
  every civilisation is influenced by one of these civilisations . 
  i assume that 's what they mean . 
  n.b : the other two places are the olmec in mexico and the norte chico civilization in peru , but they 're usually not included with the four others . 
  [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cradle_of_civilization ),

  satire is bourgeois propaganda . 
  `` ordinary people '' ? 
  do you mean blairite saboteurs and red tories who want to covertly destroy the labour party and enact a thousand-year tory reich ? 
  it 's one of the reason 's that many people in ruk dislike the snp ( besides the whole independence thing ) , they 're incredibly antagonistic towards everyone else and seem to enjoy causing disagreements and then painting themselves as victims . 
  they also have a tendency to blame westminster for devolved issues that they actually have control over and then when someone points that out they just feign ignorance . 
  slimy politics tbh , they just have n't been prominent enough for a lot of voters to realise yet ( though they are anticipating a dip in the general election ) . 
  we 've still got ours , it 's nice to have a regular supply of milk that you do n't need to worry about . 
  she actually had a degree in chemistry from oxford and worked as a scientist before entering politics . 
  apparently she was more proud of becoming the first prime minister with a science degree than the first female prime minister . 
  i 'm no thatcher fan at all but that 's one of the few things i like about her . 
  if you ever expect your vote to make a difference you 'll always be disappointed . 
  obviously getting individual people to get out and vote is good at a macro level but as far as i 'm aware , no one person has ever swung an election . 
  the reality is that your vote should always really be for your own peace-of-mind more than any sort of tactical or pragmatic reasons . 
  [ poll results ] ( https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/854806692697178119 ) [ site used to estimate seats ] ( http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/swingometer-map ) & nbsp ; ** key ( descriptions courtesy of wikipedia ) ** blue - conservatives ( tories ) - centre-right , economic liberalism , conservatism , euroscepticism , unionism red - labour - centre-left , social-democracy yellow - scottish national party ( snp ) - centre-left , scottish nationalism , social-democracy , pro-europeanism orange - liberal democrats ( lib dems ) - centre , liberalism , social liberalism , pro-europeanism light green - plaid cymru - centre-left , welsh nationalism , social-democracy , environmentalism , pro-europeanism dark-green - green party - left , green-politics , eco-socialism , progressivism , pro-europeanism & nbsp ; this is very unfortunate for the uk left-wing . 
  expect polls to fluctuate over time but do n't expect it to be anything but a tory landslide in the end . 
  edit : it 's also worth noting that this map just does a standard swing across all the results from 2015 and so does n't account for local variance due to issues such as brexit . 
  in a bi-election about half a year ago we actually saw a very pro-remain tory seat in this map swing to lib dems because of it . 
  this type of thing should average out across all constituencies though . 
  apologies for it being flickr and not imgur but it felt bad reuploading it and not crediting the photographer . 
  for those not in the know , alistair campbell was tony blair 's spin doctor and arguably the best spin doctor in the world .
