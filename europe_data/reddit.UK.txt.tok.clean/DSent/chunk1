you might want to look at http://www.travelsim.com never tried it myself , but used to work for the parent company . 
  it looks like what you want . 
  i meant those who actually live there . 
  on the contrary , i 've found these places to be amazingly beautiful , especially madeira . 
  well , yeah, 
  slowpokes represent !, 
  cue someone from sri lanka feeling european . 
  i 'm merely talking about my personal and subjective experience of the country . 
  you 're free to disagree with my opinion . 
  and no , i was actually financing the republic of cyprus , since i was paying my taxes while working there . 
  it 's more interesting because it 's just more exotic to an ordinary european . 
  landscapes are also prettier , and beaches are amazing . 
  and of course the 3 castles ( saint hilarion , buffavento and kantara ) , you get some amazing views from there . 
  saying that , my favourite city is still paphos , but kyrenia is close second . 
  having a rational and balanced discussion is too difficult a concept for many people . 
  they like to stick with their black & white view of the world . 
  and everyone seems to forget this very important paragraph from [ rediquette ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette )  please do n't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you do n't personally like it . 
  think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you 're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion . 
  if you simply take a moment to stop , think and examine your reasons for downvoting , rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction , you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons . 
  and now it 's overrun with twats :(, 
  possibly the most westernised turks there are ( well , maybe on par with those from istanbul ? ) . 
  i actually preferred the turkish part of cyprus when i was there , it 's much more interesting in my opinion . 
  i 'd say they are semi-european . 
  edit : downvoters , explain yourselves please . 
  i think it does , when it 's an obvious one . 
  good . 
  it 's bands like this that keep eurovision afloat . 
  just like conchita wurst , they generate so much publicity , and people would want to watch them , regardless of what their views on it are . 
  without these guys , it would be a just another boring , dull , cheesy contest . 
  well , actually , it sort of is anyway , but they do spice it up a bit . 
  ca n't make a circle with two dots !, 
  who said i was mad ? 
  merely stating the fact . 
   it is the governement which has cleverly rebranded it a `` mounring march '' . 
  you 're wrong , it was the organisers . 
  edit : ft : [ the organisers changed the march 's bright green logo with the word ` spring ' to all black . 
  `` i think tomorrow we should come out with russian flags and mourning ribbons but without party flags , '' said leonid volkov , one of the organisers and a member of the progress party founded by alexei navalny , the anti-corruption blogger seen as one of mr putin 's main challengers .

   the government has rebranded it a mourning marcdh . 
  guess why . 
  it was renamed by the organisers to honour the death of boris nemtsov .

  / r/europe ca n't into sarcasm :(, 
  you 're assuming that cia and kgb are separate entities !, 
  my view is that in modern russia , you 're still not free to express your views , so that certainly has n't changed . 
  the whole thing was a cia plot from the beginning . 
   sorry for being cynical but i do n't think this protest will do much . 
  the sad truth is that you are 100 % right . 
  yes , before his death it was called an ` anti-crisis march ', 
  the original event was called an ` anti-crisis march ' , they 've now renamed it to be ` march in honour of boris nemtsov ' . 
  essentially , nothing 's changed , since it was considered an anti-government protest from the beginning ( they could n't call it that for the obvious reasons ) . 
   there has been no official figure on turnout yet , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 70,000 . 
  as a general rule , the average figure is going to be the closest to the real one . 
  so that puts it at around 40,000 . 
  [ link to a bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31677506 )  tens of thousands of people have marched through central moscow ** to honour opposition politician boris nemtsov ** it 's not an ` anti-government march in moscow today ' per se , even thought technically it can be considered as such . 
  put him on a pole !, 
  am i doing this right ? 
  seriously if there 's one thing that this subreddit taught me is how easily the witch hunts start . 
  [ link to a bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31681293 ), 
  circlejerk is the key word here . 
  it seems most people here are unwilling to have a proper , balanced discussion and instead settle for mindlessly downvoting anything that does n't support their point of view , even if it makes sense and is supported by strong arguments . 
   who are mostly behind the increase in anti-semitism i knew it all along , fucking world health organisation , spreading hate everywhere !, 
  shills , assemble !, 
  i do n't know why you 're being so heavily downvoted , what you said makes perfect sense . 
  but you ca n't deny that the current political situation between the eu and russia allows us oil & gas industry to sell more of that stuff . 
  so saying that nobody benefits is incorrect . 
  the proof is in the headline . 
  and guess who 's benefitting from it yet again ? 
  do you even squat ? 
  you : sorry mate , i do n't smoke .

  finnish chavs are adorable ... not that i 'm surprised . 
  itt : lots of people who actually take eurovision seriously, 
  how is it international ? 
  does it affect any country other than estonia ? 
  and i was only joking , by the time i posted , all the comments were from estonians . 
  u w0t m8 ?

  england 's definitely nowhere near a swamp , only some parts of east anglia can be categorized as such . 
  cause that 's what bbc 's known for , amiright ? 
  `` the girl was found by a police officer in early 2010 , alone in the family flat in south west london . 
  he told the court she was wearing a nappy that was falling off between her legs , that her clothes were wet and she was shivering . 
  he said there was a strong smell of urine and faeces . '', 
  the problem is then the rest of / r/europe would be almost completely empty . 
  in case of ireland , you actually want to compare gni per capita , to exclude the income of all the multinationals : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gni_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita , which is more or less the same : ireland 35,090 united kingdom 35,760 here 's more about it in detail : http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/2015/05/13/ireland-is-the-wealthiest-economy-in-europe-or-not/,

  yet, 
  well it is accurate then ? 
  does n't say 9pc in one year anywhere in the article . 
  london , without contest . 
  i 'll definitely move there after selling my kidney . 
   lol telegraph , tory 's mouthpiece ... what does this have to do with anything ? 
   the fund estimated the immediate effect of sanctions and counter-sanctions had been to wipe between 1pc and 1.5 pc off gdp , rising to 9pc over the next few years .
