   your public parks and riverfront are not worth visiting i can sort of undestand the rest of your arguments , but london 's parks and riverfront not worth visiting , really ? 
  surely you must be exagerrating ... 
  so ... if you ca n't into nordic ... make nordic come to you ? 
  a worthy plan !, 
  if only you could into nordic ... 
  the fuck has happened to this sub ... 
  no it 's not . 
  or at least has n't been for a number of years already . 
  nah , taxes and gambling laws . 
  uhmm ... romania can make you sick ? 
   ~ ~ russia ~ ~ reddit is preparing for a war and they do this shit ? 
  what the fuck ... ftfy, 
  i know you guys are talking usual off topic shit in the comments , but if anyone gets a chance , i seriously do wholeheartedly recommend visiting istanbul . 
  there is definitely something very special about it . 
  also , it 's perfect if you enjoy walking . 
  probably one of the most walkable ~ ~ capitals ~ ~ large cities . 
  oh and then there 's food . 
  the only reason it has n't overtaken paris yet is because it 's a bit out of the way . 
  nokia is an overrated too , just stick to using landline . 
  not the worst . 
  i suggest reading [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3a25gi/cgp_grey_why_the_uk_election_results_are_the/cs9594b ) by / u/onesalientoversight , where he kindly explains why that 's not the case . 
  here , high five !, 
   so in the end , it would be easier to replace uk in that equation , than to replace estonia . 
  not sure if i completely agree , but that 's an interesting point . 
  i believe both countries need each other just as much . 
  i know that , i was just semi-joking . 
  [ fortumo ] ( https://fortumo.com/ ) is another good one . 
  it 's from tartu , i believe . 
   yes , uk is the only country in the world that has money . 
  you are right ... that 's not what i meant at all . 
  you can have a brilliant idea , but without sufficient funding , promotion , etc. 
  it 's never going to be realized . 
   but that 's hardly what really matters on the contrary , that 's what matters the most . 
  but , but ... where 's muh e-stonia , [ the startup country ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39l35r/ ) ... [ paradise ] ( https://www.businessvibes.com/blog/estonia-startup-paradise ) ? 
  if you judge commenter 's knowledge by their usernames , you 're gon na have a bad time on reddit . 
   this subreddit is quickly turning into a xenophobic/racist circlejerk . 
  hate to say this , but that 's already happened for a while, 
  you 're good at twisting logic you !, 
  -- say eerik , why does all the eesti beer taste like donkey piss ? 
  -- ~ ~ fucking ~ ~ kuradi soviets , it 's all their fault , tiimo !, 
  ok , makes sense , thanks . 
  it 's been like this for a while already , since the ukraine conflict at least . 
  jerk jerk jerk, 
  so edgy, 
  fucking russian empire !, 
   most important affairs in europe  75 years ago today , soviet aircraft okay, 
  why are we discussing this now ? 
  anything new surfaced on the subject ? 
  gollandeeyah and needehrlahndyh, 
  germany tried acquiring most of europe in the world war ii era . 
  would the motivations have stopped existing since that time ? 
  asia russia daily as a source ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  the source they cited is very vague , no names given at all . 
  [ ancient tradition ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dogging ), 
   do you want to try to be a ** re ** productive member of society ? 
  then yes , please come to germany ftfy, 
  poor guy , no one wants him :(, 
  calm down , latvia , one day you can too into nordic . 
  agreed , especially the news that are 2 months old . 
  [ like that 's news ... ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/putin-kremlin-inside-russian-troll-house ), 
  first it was a nordic category in eurovision and now this ? 
  i believe there 's only one thing now that 's keeping eesti from becoming a proper nordic country - the silly stripey flag , time to ditch it in favour of a nordic cross !, 
  average russians are n't really involved in the negotiations , it 's between politicians . 
  hence my point , still better than nothing . 
  and free abortions , but with only 1 % success rate . 
  but could they be programmed to kill all old humans ? 
  in the uk the childcare is crazy expensive , and lots of people are still having children . 
  i totally agree that it should n't be that expensive , but at the same time i 'm not sure if that 's the root of the problem . 
  because any kind of negotiation and discussion is better than isolation ? 
  what a sensationalist title . 
  more like [ russian opposition activist vladimir kara-murza in hospital after falling ill ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/russian-opposition-activist-vladimir-kara-murza-in-hospital-after-falling-ill ) . 
  seriously , even in russia people sometimes just get ill / overdose , not everyone 's getting poisoned . 
  so they sort of indirectly admitted that ukraine is a ` special operation ' ? 
  uk outperforms poland in [ education ] ( http://thelearningcurve.pearson.com/index/index-ranking ) and [ health ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst//most-efficient-health-care-2014-countries ) , reports find . 
  see what i did there ? 
  according to [ this report ] ( http://www.stat.ee/90643 ) , the population of estonia is still on decline , although it 's getting better . 
  but nevertheless , that seems like a problem to me . 
  it 's not like you 're terribly overpopulated , so a couple of thousand of migrants wo n't do you any worse , if managed properly . 
  as others said , they 'll probably move on to wherever the grass is greener anyway . 
  and you arrived to that number how ? 
  i knew it was all estonia 's ploy from the beginning . 
  north & south downs and new forest as well . 
  you sure enjoy the name ` graptolitic argillite ' !, 
  personally , i think it needs to be renamed to something catchier to succeed . 
  i would n't call having 80 % of the population brainwashed as a collective intellectual achievement of said population . 
  at least in the sense the op meant it : culture : * the arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement regarded collectively . 
  i do n't think the uk really cares about what you care . 
   you will not grasp her with your mind  or cover with a common label ,  for russia is one of a kind --  believe in her , if you are able ... -- fyodor tyutchev, 
  the way they 're not fazed by anything is genuinely scary at times . 
  sounds like a recipe for disaster , to be honest . 
  do n't forget that that ` strong , fearless politicians ' would have to resign at some point , and whoever takes his place will be in trouble if he does n't have the same qualities . 
  that 's a pretty cool fact !, 
   the language is simply beautiful seriously ? 
  what do you like specifically ? 
  the grammar , pronunciation , the accent , etc ? 
  i 'm genuinely surprised . 
  as a native russian speaker , i never really thought of it as beautiful . 
  best answer . 
  again , that 's nothing to do with the culture in its general sense .
