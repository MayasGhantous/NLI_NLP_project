  you 're confusing culture with the political views of the population . 
  two completely unrelated things . 
  yeah this one is really pretty . 
  looks bit cheap . 
  czech castles are much more beautiful in my opinion . 
  but what 's the benefit of having a one-sided discussion ? 
  there 's nothing there that suggests that these people are flying home to vote in the referendum . 
  bank holiday & half-term is the answer . 
  * ~ ~ queue at dublin airport tonight as hundreds fly home to vote in tomorrows marriage equality referendum ~ ~ * ~ ~ queue at dublin airport tonight as hundreds fly home ~ ~ * queue at dublin airport tonight ftfy, 
  soo is this a goth or an emo party ? 
  looks like it 's working . 
  well there you go . 
  low on karma ? 
  want an easy and painless recovery ? 
  come to / r/europe and post some shit about russia , instant returns guaranteed !, 
  we need at least 10 shit posts daily , so everyone 's welcome . 
  commie spotted !, 
  whoa !, 
  this day today will be remembered for generations to come . 
  it 's going to be second most important after independence day , mark my words !, 
  if you 'll be coming from the north , i suggest doing the milford - chiddingfold - petworth route . 
  the landscapes and villages along that route are simply beautiful . 
  passes right through the heart of the south downs national park as well !, 
  [ arundel is really pretty ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=arundel&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) it 's a small town with a massive castle and a cathedral . 
  i 'd vote for lib dems , but they wo n't let me , as i 've no citizenship :( hoping for another tory-lib-dem coalition . 
  it 's interesting how people 's opinion change over the years . 
  i bet the results would 've been marginally different if they conducted a similar poll in the 50s . 
   they were even worse than the nazis . 
  please could you elaborate ? 
  [ we 've already met 3 days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/34eef8/the_worst_job_in_the_world_meet_natos_envoy_to/ ), 
  exactly , but you also need faster upload speed for transferring stuff , which is usually much slower than the download . 
  i fail to see how these speeds are beneficial for more than 1 % of the population . 
  unless you 're living in some sort of student accommodation , etc and need to share the line with many others . 
  what about 2.75 mln who do n't have any high-speed internet ? 
  ( [ from the same website ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/over-2-75-mln-romanians-lack-high-speed-internet-access/147367/ ) ) . 
  i now have 50mbps , before it was 30mbps , and never did i wish to have higher download speeds . 
  upload speeds , on the other hand ... 
  conservatives only value pain , because ... because they 're evil !, 
   except they are not looking for crazies , but for professional journalists no self-respecting professional journalist would go to work for sputnik . 
  so that leaves them with crazies . 
  and even then they 're struggling to find anyone ... 
  honestly , i 'm quite surprised . 
  there 's an abundance of extremely pro-russia crazies in estonia ( ironically , many of whom had never stepped a foot in russia ) . 
  sometimes they 're even more patriotic than native russians , because they do n't actually live there and only see the bits that the propaganda media wants them to see ( and it 's always sunny in the propaganda world ) . 
  i mostly meant the unbiased news sources , of which there 's few decent ones . 
  state control over media has nothing to do with it ( i 'm sure that in this regard ukraine is much better than russia ) . 
  maybe it 's just the articles that people tend to link to through this subreddit , but i cringe at how one-sided and subjectively the information is presented most of the time . 
  russia 's got meduza.io ( although technically they 're latvia-based ) , slon , rbc and some others . 
  but these all have a very small reach , most people had never even heard of them . 
  i think what ukraine needs is a proper , quality , nationwide news broadcaster that would present the information in an unbiased and objective way . 
  something like bbc ( ubc ? ), 
  would be perfect , 
  very well said . 
  unfortunately , this is going to be hard to comprehend for most people . 
  the ` us versus them ' mentality is deeply entrenched in us since the tribal days . 
  you can only pick one side . 
   sanctions must make at least some people question why the world is turning against them and maybe wake them up . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  general rhetoric among russians is something along the lines of `` evil west is trying to bring down glorious russia with their silly sanctions , this is all a us plot , russia 's absolutely not to blame , everyone hates us , putin 's our saviour , etc etc '' . 
  this is of course also heavily spinned by the state-owned ( 99 % ) media . 
  one word : brainwashed . 
  if you look at major cities like moscow or st. petersburg , the approval ratings are much lower , as people there tend to travel more and are generally exposed to a more diverse information . 
  russia 's not a democracy . 
  it 's a one-party system . 
  people really do n't have a choice . 
  the ruling party keeps control over everything , including people 's choices and minds . 
  i understand that you 're a russophobe , but saying that the russian people deserve it and are responsible for all the shit that 's happening to them is incredibly selfish and simply incorrect . 
  you 'll need to ban tmt along with most ukrainian and us news sources if you want unbiased news . 
  trouble is , where do you draw the line with this ? 
  if you do n't like the source , then simply do n't click the link / downvote it / etc. 
  edit : i do n't want to piss off ukrainians , but seriously , your news media is not that much better than russian . 
   i do n't want this here to become a pro-eu/anti-russian circlejerk . 
  sorry to burst your bubble , but that 's exactly what this subreddit is about . 
  there is no such thing as an unbreakable system . 
  it all depends on how much resources is spent on trying to break it . 
  at the moment , there 's not much interest in it , and that 's what 's keeping it safe . 
  moscow times had become a tabloid as of recently . 
  i stopped reading their articles , too much sensationalism ( especially in the titles ) . 
  it 's irrelevant who these people were , it does n't justify the killings . 
  is norway hiding something ? 
  ... on paper . 
  and what are you on about ? 
  russia 's such a fertile soil for investigative & undercover journalism !, 
  if only it was n't a life-threatening business . 
  fuck conscription !, 
  do n't really have anything to add to this ... 
  military is evil . 
  guns be damned . 
  only reactionary fools want to maintain conscription . 
  it 's sexual discrimination . 
  slavery !, 
  blah blah blah . 
  cheers for saving me time writing this !, 
   uk - abso-f-ing-lutely not . 
  bit harsh :(, 
  [ granny farming ] ( https://novbm.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/10-23-07_1935.jpg ) , heheh, 
  it seems you ca n't into data ... 
  what a misleading title - it does n't say anything about nordics being better at recycling in the article . 
  in fact , if you look at the [ data ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wasmun&amp;lang=en ) provided by / u/countvontroll , they seem to be pretty average at it . 
  there 's a reason why most people are unable to pinpoint estonia on a map , it 's just so damn small !,
