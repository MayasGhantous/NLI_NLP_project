yup but look at it from the perspective of national level politics . 
  a government has brought through a new , quite serious change , they 'll want it to look as impressive as possible to potential voters so they 'll likely use rhetoric like this . 
  do they ? 
  not trying to load the question but in my head a plane crash with passenger jets is usually 100 % fatalities . 
  at work and on my phone just now so i ca n't check properly , but if those numbers are what you say , then fair enough , i was basing my views on current seats . 
   again , trying to paint your rivals as unpopular foreigners is neither true nor helpful can you please not say that ? 
  i do n't know why you 're implying i 'm saying this and i find it rude . 
  as in the text you quoted , i 'm referring to scottish branches - during the uk general elections , votes in scotland for labour are just that , labour votes and not scottish labour votes . 
  and in that area , where the snp have more seats that the next three parties combined , i do n't think at all incorrect to describe the those parties as unpopular by comparison . 
  the vote was yes or no , but that does not in any way mean the reasons people made the decision for either was as binary . 
  on either side you will find a plethora of reasons people voted one way or the other , but the take away is that the decision was one that was both complex and important . 
  i would argue that anyone who voted simply on the basis of pure idealism along the lines of `` nationalism '' or `` solidarity '' , was not making as informed , or though-out , a decision as they should have done , and was not seeing that the world ( and the politics we weave over it ) is far more intricate and elaborate than `` black and white '' . 
  do n't speak in those blind absolutes please , the world is never that black and white . 
  if you 've had the misfortune of meeting people who voted yes simply because they `` wanted a nation of scotland for scots '' then i feel sorry for your bad luck , on both sides i met people whose arguments were a lot better and far more fleshed out than `` nationalism vs solidarity '' . 
  will be in trouble with the electorate for a decision the electorate made ? 
  doubt it . 
  the snp have been in power for years even when there was very little support for independence , and i do n't see the scottish branches of the westminster parties gaining much after a shaky referendum , especially when they were already unpopular . 
  we lost a chance to be in a country not spiralling towards the right in a wave of populism , scaremongering and sensationalism which may very well lead to a uk out of the eu and with ukip tits governing laws we live by . 
  so i 'm hoping the snp stay as , or more , powerful as to allow scotland to maintain some sanity during a bleak future , and to ensure those very last minute promises of more devolution are delivered on . 
   i do believe they deserve the right to independence , but i also recognize the fact that they think this will help their economy and solve their employment crisis . 
  absolutely not . 
  there is no magic solution to problems like this , but there can be massive improvements nonetheless . 
  i believe though that catalan independence would indeed improve their economy as they are one of the richer regions of spain . 
  it 's similar with imagining if bavaria became independent , or if northern italy became independent , these regions are undeniably more prosperous and better off , and give more to the country than than they take . 
  of course , this is reliant on trade between the rest of their country and other countries , so excluding any trade embargoes or alike , i imagine they would be better off post independence . 
  i realise the support may be stronger in smaller places , but the few times i 've been to barcelona , it seemed like every second flat was flying a catalonia flag . 
  my impression is that even though support is stronger is towns and rural areas , that support is still pretty massive in barcelona itself . 
  very interesting to know , cheers for the information , 
  maybe i 'm being naive , but i did n't see it happening anyway . 
  we have a lot of neddy arseholes in scotland who can be complete cunts , but rioting ( not that they 're morally above it ) is not something i see them doing for whateve reason . 
  scot here . 
  i 'm not passing any personal judgement on caledonian_scot , but i do n't think his views are massively representative of a lot of scots . 
  particularly , it 's the first time in my life i 've heard someone identify as celtic . 
  it 's not really an identifier which is particularly applicable to our societies today , and is a very historical term for a very broad set of people . 
  i 've heard people say they do n't identify as british , but i would say a lot of us are fairly passive when it comes to declaring our identity . 
  of course , steer clear of / r/scotland , or facebook pages for yes/no to the referendum , the people in there want to make me want to be neither scottish or british when i read their comments -_-, 
    for diplomatic reasons nobody is calling this what it is , which is treason . 
   give me a break . 
  are you stuck in the 15th century ? 
  was going to mention then when i replied to his post , it 's such an incredibly weird thing to say . 
  remember those big independence marches with people from every walk of life , men , women , elderly and children ? 
  treasonous bastards the lot of them :d, 
  | the catalonians are n't catalonians whatever they say . 
  they are spaniards . 
  they have a distinct culture , their own language , with political beliefs ( on the whole ) different from a lot of the rest of spain and a large part of the people want independence . 
  whether or not you believe they should have independence is one thing , but to say catalans are n't catalans is just absurd 0_o edit : fixed for `` catalans '' not `` catalonians '', 
  does anyone know of any articles on this ? 
  safest roads in the world , statistically speaking . 
  does it affect tourism ? 
   poor jews ? 
  in which universe do you live in ? 
  are you implying that there are no poor jews ? 
  thanks , will have a look . 
  on a tangent , how were the government in exile and the monarchy viewed by the people when they returned ? 
  was there happiness about it , or was there an air of resentment since they had fled and not experienced the occupation ? 
  i think it was a big part of nazi ideology that easterners were sub-human , which might explain their treatment . 
  i do wonder though , what in his crazy ethnicity-focussed mind , hitler thought of french and british peoples . 
  in his head we were not `` eastern rats '' but neither scandinavian `` ideal peoples '' , so what were we to him ? 
  i know he was on record for apparent admiration of the british empire , but i wonder if he still thought of brits/french/spaniards as lower than germans from a racial point of view . 
  not just explicit propaganda , but simply decades of the american culture being ubiquitous and dominant . 
  is it really possible to quantify such a thing with numbers ? 
  or in other words , can you explain for example what that 30 % actually means ? 
  what was it then ? 
  i get that it 's worded the soviet ** union ** , but i assumed this was in a federal way , like the ** united ** states of america . 
  is it quite easy to read for those who are not expert historians ? 
  from my purely non-expert point of view , i think the germans could have beaten the ussr . 
  the german war machine was absolutely astounding relative to their size , but they had a terrible leader in hitler . 
  edit : bit of downvoting , so just to reiterate , this is just a musing , and very well aware than i am no authority on the subject :d, 
   ussr brought people , the us brought equipment , the rest of the allies provided bloody , unyielding resistance . 
  that is a very good explanation of the major features . 
  obviously these lines blur and cross over , but you 've hit the nail on the head of the definitive aspects . 
  i guess it 's something to do with those places only occupied in less powerful areas . 
  if they stay in these areas , it looks like annexation of part of an independent country , whereas if they stay in areas which contain the entire nation ( many places in eastern europe ) or large important parts of the country ( e. berlin or e. germany ) , it looks a lot less like annexation . 
  i think reasoned people on either side of the debate would agree that it is simply not that black and white . 
  monarchy has both advantages , and disadvantages , and these vary from country to country , but off the top of my head i ca n't think of a monarchy which is purely a disadvantage with not a single advantage . 
  as with everything in life , things are n't so simple , there are goods and there are bads , the question is how do they compare . 
  i agree that a federal system of sorts would be a good option , but it 's a fundamental change to the system , and i do n't think big changes do well in uk politics . 
  it would be shot down by those who are fearful of it ( `` imagine the havoc caused by such a change !, 
  '' ) , those who are blindly traditional ( `` we have a system that 's survived for hundreds of years through our proudest hours !, 
  '' ) , those who stand to lose power/interests and those who are swayed by the current power/interest holders ( `` well i read it in the sun , they said it was bad '' ) . 
  i 'm sure if you think about the alternative vote referendum , you 'll easily find people who slot into those categories , and together they number a big amount of voters . 
  i 'd bet if any sort of federal system was proposed it would be shot down by these people with even more vigour . 
  due to our system , federalism is just bit too * out there * for uk politics . 
  i would n't mind the idea of devo max , to be honest . 
  the main reason i want to be independent is that i want to see a scotland where the more left leaning nature of our population is reflected in the laws that govern us . 
  if devo max let 's there be a scotland politically representative of its people , then i probably do n't mind staying in the uk . 
  that being said , devo max will never offer anything in terms of foreign policy , so let 's hope that popularity for ukip and fringes of the tories are just running on momentum from the recession which will hopefully die soon . 
  the food is what you make it now . 
  it 's not like decades ago where you were limited in what you could make unless you were rich and had lots of free time . 
  want to make an incredible chinese dish ? 
  sure , look up the recipe , buy the equipment from amazon or argos , and grab the ingredients from your local supermarket ( or your local chinese foods shop at a push ) . 
  would rather a spicy mexican meal ? 
  well there 's tonnes of mexican food kits probably within 10 minutes walk for you to purchase from tesco or morrisons . 
  again , ingredients are no issue to come by . 
  or do you fancy getting it made for you ? 
  well go to one of the limitless foreign take-aways or restaurants , where a meal will cost between an hour or two 's worth of minimum wage . 
  why are the systems not yet able to handle windy conditions ? 
  i would have assumed that given the plethora of sensors on an aircraft ( i.e plentiful input data ) and the fact that at this kind of large level , as far as i know , you do n't need a super computer to model realistic physics , that we would be able to have a very reliable auto landing system in aircraft . 
  maybe that 's the final test in the french citizenship test . 
  the examinee is brought into the garage , and is simply presented with a car in front of him - the examiner says nothing .
