more than that -- most of the fuck-ups that happened during his presidency were blamed on his goons . 
  that map is made by the same people , spitting image , a british satire show in the 80s/90s about politics . 
  kek you 're not as rightist as you 're original comments would make you appear to be , i 'll give you that . 
  but this :  you were n't expecting that were you ? 
  you wanted me to be partisan and salty like you . 
  sorry to disappoint . 
  is like the smuggest shit i 've seen on reddit . 
  like if you wanted to make that point , then you should n't have said that that is your point . 
   globally , the left murder . 
  http://www.petersaysstuff.com/2014/05/attempting-the-impossible-calculating-capitalisms-death-toll/ anyway you 're clearly to far gone to argue against your main points , all i have to say to you is ` bash the fash , class war now ' because i know you will be triggered by it . 
  it deliberately does that because the average right-winger has a very limited grasp of geography so the world is presented as confusing . 
   fsm flying spaghetti monster ? 
  they also did one for america , but i ca n't find it . 
  great show , anyone who has n't should watch it if they have even a loose grasp of british politics in the late '80s and early '90s .

  edit : kek at the salty right-wingers downvoting me . 
  i 'm going to move there as soon as possible . 
  more chance of succeeding as a nation than the rest of the uk , now . 
  i 'm quite left-wing , but that quote is taken out of context . 
  i read the article it cites where he says that , and basically , what it says is that obama dislikes the uk , because the uk was a dick to kenyans in the empire days . 
  not a valid point , but it certainly is n't racial profiling . 
  who said i was ? 
  because you ca n't generalise based on the actions of a few . 
  unless you 're saying the vast majority of jews participated in the atlantic slave trade ? 
  oh sweet christ . 
  someone unironically blaming jews . 
  thought that shit was only in fringe neo-nazi groups, 
  / s i hope ? 
  democratic unionist party . 
  after theresa may lost her majority hold on parliament , she had to form a coalition , as it is required for a government to have a majority in parliament ( 326 seats ) . 
  she had 319 seats and the dup had 10 seats , so if they form a coalition , they can make a government . 
  the dup were fairly irrelevant until now . 
  they are a regional party , which means only people in a certain area of the country can vote for them , in this case , northern ireland . 
  basically to explain the dup i would have to explain centuries of religious turmoil in ireland but tl ; dr protestants make up 60 % of ni , catholics make up 40 % ( again , massive simplification and these are n't actual stats ) . 
  the dup is basically a party of protestant extremists who want to stay in the uk while sinn fein , their leftist and largely catholic opponents in ni want to leave . 
  so basically , the answer to your question is : right-wing irish protestants .

  yeah , because as i explained the dup are much more specific group of people than islam . 
  but how am i a hypocrite ?

  well they 're not the as part of that , but they 're certainly assholes . 
  i do n't really see the point you are making . 
   have n't you literally just lumped the dup and it 's supporters into one group to be disparaged ? 
  they are a group that believes the same thing , no ? 
  dup are a much more specific group than the global muslim population . 
  they all agree on their views about gays , refugees , abortion etc. 
  where as muslims are not so united . 
   your op literally says sharia and dup are aligned , suggesting the principles/beliefs are bad yes shariah and dup are both shit i 'm not sure what your point is .

   and that 's the majority is it ? 
  that 's what the good book says does it ? 
  that 's the culture of the middle east and africa , is it ? 
  regardless of whether it 's a majority or not i 'm not willing to hate on a few people just because the majority are bastards . 
  i would hate the bastards specifically , and not the reasonable ones . 
   as does anyone that believes things contrary to modern european values , anyone promoting such thing and acting to change a country to honour and enshrine ridiculous beliefs , correct ? 
  really depends what you mean by ` european values ' . 
  red flag is quite literally the anthem of labour , not sure why he 's a communist for singing it lol . 
  do n't take it so seriously it 's tongue-in-cheek .

  muslims do n't all believe in sharia law though , atleast , not in its traditional interpretation . 
  no , because religious views and political views are very different things , even if right-wingers may combine the two . 
  a muslim can be a pacifist , who thinks gay people should be able to get married , and think that the death penalty is wrong . 
  he may not be a very good muslim , but a muslim he is . 
  he 's not hurting anyone with these beliefs , he 's not shouting in a public place that everyone who is n't muslim is going to hell , or whatever . 
  where as people like the dup actually do have a negative effect . 
   i promise you that this is not a scary place to live , other than abortion legislation ( which is backward ) , it 's practically the same . 
  i am not forced to wear a head dress , or go to a church . 
  we do not have a mandatory day of prayer , the shopping hours are just a bit shorter , like the rest of the uk . 
  ik all of this . 
  the poster , i thought , was only meant to be seen semi-seriously as a smear against the dup , simply pointing out hypocrisy , not as a serious challenge to dup 's platform . 
  i thought that was obvious with the line dancing part . 
  the post blew up and people on both sides of the argument have had some pretty strong feelings about it . 
  anti-islam maybe . 
  a muslim is a person , i find it hard to be against one monolithic group simply due to the size of it , as that creates a diversity of opinion . 
  muslims who think that gays should be executed , women beaten etc. , then yeah , fuck em , but there are plenty of muslims who disagree with that . 
   he purposely excludes the part i just googled ` woman headcover bible ' and that came up lol also it 's not much better if you 're policing the length of a woman 's hair rather than it 's visibility .
