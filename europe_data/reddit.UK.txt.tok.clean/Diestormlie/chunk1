as a brit , i feel that this is relevant to europe , yet i lack the vocab to explain why i feel that . 
  do n't offer ukraine membership or we 'll invade it ... ohwait, 
  too lazy , will not comply . 
  counties ... or countries ? 
  my choice is ` btr-80something ', 
   spacecfraft, 
  i have absolutely no idea . 
  i do n't know enough about the btr-80 series . 
  i have eyes enough to nitpick with the images set before me , but not the knowledge to put forward my own choice . 
  take a look at the left viewports and front firing port . 
  i 'm fairly sure they 're different . 
  firing ports are very different in both of them . 
  front viewports and searchlight also look different . 
  sure , the 1972 marder 3 is not in service yes , but still , it would be patently wrong to say that the marder 3 is not in service . 
  as for the second part ... 
  i do n't speak russian , nor am i familiar with the landscape of ukraine . 
  as for the btr-80a ... 
  hate to say it , but looking at the horribly compressed footage , it does n't look like a btr-80a . 
  marder 3 : 1972 onwards ( germany ) warrior ifv : 1988 onwards ( uk ) m2 bradley : 1982 onwards ( usa ) combat vehicle 90 : 1993 onwards ( sweden ) mitsubishi type 89 : 1989 onwards ( japan ) bmp-3 : 1987 onwards ( russia ) all of these are modern infantry fighting vehicles , currently in military service . 
  what 's your point ? 
  armies do n't receive new ifvs in their christmas crackers . 
  now now , do n't listen to this hogwash !, 
  man turned out to be a dirty communist !, 
   from the us  spanish flag  i 'm conflicted you really , really are ... 
  actually , know we 're on the subject ... 
  spain would like a word ... 
  `` and so we entrust our futures to thee : a last alliance of meccano and geomag . 
  they are all that stand between lego and our heartlands . '', 
  there 's nothing * inherently * unforgivable about concentration camps . 
  a concentration camp is simply ` gather group a , place group a in singular location . ', 
  concentrate them . 
  hence , concentration camp . 
  however , using them as a tool for the deliberate destruction of group a ( through starvation , ` death by work ' , flat out use of death machines etc. 
  etc. ), 
  is * inherently unforgivable *, 
  well , we made nice to japan . 
  but sir !, 
  chili powder is banned under international treaties !, 
  warning : i 'm going off igcses here ( public school yeah ... ) i was always told by teachers that the ict one was word/excel/computer components etc. 
  and that the computing one was actually programming . 
  i did the computing one , and i can confirm , it was programming . 
  you 'll be wanting the computing gcse , not the ict one . 
   turkish cypriots are part of the legitimate roc misread that as part of the legitimate republic of china . 
  got confused . 
  the thing is , mp 's say in electing party leaders ... varies . 
  for labour : http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8444558.stm?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter for tories : http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/81998.stm for lib dems : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_democrats_leadership_election,_2007#the_rules_of_the_contest -- tory mps have the most power , but in all cases the paid up party members are involved at some point , and they vastly outnumber the mps . 
  the eu parliament also has one . 
  ... i do n't see how this translates to legislative initiative . 
  please clarify . 
  the westminster parliament does not elect the head of government ( prime ministers are invited to form a government by the head of state ) nor the head of political parties ( as they are elected however the party in question has decided . ), 
   almost all is very different from all . 
  i 'm taking this to mean ` almost none ' and ` none . ', 
  another thing that should be noted : * de jure * and * de facto * : in theory and in fact . 
  * de jure * the westminster parliament has more legislative initiative . 
  * de facto * i 'd be willing to bet the eu parliament has more . 
  espicially given the fact that only executive approved private member 's bills get through ( as an example , all private member 's bills passed 2012-2013 were introduced by tories . ), 
  in fact , private member 's bills are sometimes used in order for the government to enact legislation it wants to but feels like it can not endorse . 
  ( eg : abortion and homosexuality in the 60 's . ), 
  ahem . 
  the westminster parliament ( the legislature ) has very little legislative initiative , with almost all bills introduced by the executive . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private_member's_bill#house_of_commons_procedure thirteen fridays a year , five hours on each of the fridays , several bills per session , no timetabled debate for each bill , so a bill can be ` talked out ' by people . 
  you 're thinking about it all wrong . 
  you need to balance the states by population , roughly units of 5-10 million . 
   ( and where people drank their wine without water ) the savages !, 
  barbarians !, 
  i 'd kickstart that project . 
  beam it down again ? 
  you do have some !, 
  sort of : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moldauhafen, 
  i imagine the choice was ` do this or we put you on a flight to dc . ', 
  putin 's got him by the balls . 
  you and i both know who it was posted by . 
  maybe for south america football ? 
  they go fucking nuts for it over there . 
  i 'm agreeing , apart from the fact it 's car , not caf . 
  republic , not federation . 
  only 4 !, 
  europe : fuck yeah . 
  he 's refering to ` niebling ' . 
  upvoted anyway due to line of questions . 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lega_nord they 're a north italian political party , favouring policies like federalism and regionalism that would favour north italy . 
   but when they were near malta , the dinghy 's motor caught fire . 
  after they had put out the fire , the leghisti tried to launch a distress signal . 
  somehow , however , the launcher must have been facing the wrong direction , for the flare pierced the rubber dinghy and they all ended up in the sea . 
  italian captains ... 
  poland ? 
   because it got approved by the international community it got approved from the international community because because they could whip their populations into a war fervour over it . 
  another parallel . 
  this is europe we 're talking about . 
  i 'm sure there are tons of precedents for a country annexing bits of other countries on the basis of protecting the people within the annexed territory . 
  `` we 're slavs !, 
  not teuton ! '', 
  the problem is , both nations thought themselves perfectly within their rights to do what they did . 
  what the nazis did was illegitimate , obviously , goes the russian thinking . 
  but only because they lost , in the end . 
  united kingdom of the british isles and thr netherlands . 
  about ireland ... 
  why a barbecue advert ? 
  victory for free speech !, 
   factcheking yes , we really do need it !,
