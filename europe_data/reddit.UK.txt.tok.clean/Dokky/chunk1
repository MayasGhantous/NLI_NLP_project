i guess many do , and many are indifferent especially if they are nowhere near the country . 
  standard human reaction . 
  thanks for that , will pick up a copy of that book you suggested . 
   or being given to the natives under the promise that they 'd convert to the protestant faith this was my issue . 
  i am by no means an expert on this sorry piece of history , and have never heard this before . 
  just a bit of referencing would be handy . 
  i would be very careful cherry-picking certain aspects and inflating them like this . 
  best to have a through read : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_ ( ireland ) as ever , check the sources . 
   a very sad series of events , which lead to my ancestors moving to scotland !, 
  i was referring specifically to british india . 
  ireland is a different matter , yes , the policies of the irish gov , british gov and landowners created the perfect storm that was the famine . 
  no , it was not a systematic policy of genocide ( as some republicans harp on about ) . 
  just a quick fyi . 
  the colonial administrators were great record keepers , prior to that few were kept . 
  ergo , it appears famine became rife under british rule , the actuality is records were better . 
  the partition of bengal , what a clusterfuck . 
  entire cabinet did n't vote . 
  swedish turnip !, 
  i learnt that from an old gaming buddy , called paska poski . 
  aye , a matter of perspective . 
  aye , controversial topics that naturally divide opinion are a good way to cause some fuss !, 
  for now !, 
  i find calling [ mannerheim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_emil_mannerheim ) a nazi upsets those finns i have spoken to . 
  i have seen a bad video involving a baguette , yes it has multiple uses . 
  drain it and create nova palestine . 
  they just lap up the bullshit and regurgitate it . 
  in one breath they mock us for how ` insignificant ' we are and then spit their dummy out about how ` oppressive ' we are . 
  scania, 
  climb the tower or visit the roman basilica ruins in the crypt for a different perspective . 
  in the uk , if you live in a conurbation or large city it is very useful and well connected . 
  if you live in the countryside , away from a railway station , then it is a lifeline for residents but services are not very frequent . 
  cost wise , it is very expensive over here for passes . 
  for me personally , me and my other half have a car which she uses to get to work . 
  i use public transport , then have a pool car at work to use for work business . 
  i pay # 102/month for rail & bus travel throughout west yorkshire , which i think is relatively cheap , but i can understand for part-time workers/those on lower incomes it is a large chunk of their wage . 
  going to do 7 for the county i live in , [ yorkshire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yorkshire ) in [ northern england ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_england ) . 
  1 ) [ arqiva emley moor tower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emley_moor_transmitting_station ) - as a kid , this landmark heralded in the final leg of the journey from holidays in cornwall . 
  at 330.4 m ( 1,084 ft ) in height , it is the tallest free-standing structure in the uk . 
  my uncles 's company used to insure it . 
  2 ) [ sutton bank ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sutton_bank ) - this hill marks the transition from the vale of york to the plateau that is the north york moors . 
  it is very steep , and a pain in the arse to drive up ( let alone walk/cycle ! ) . 
  the pay-off is the [ view from the top ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/photograph_of_sutton_bank_at_dusk.jpg ) , you can see for miles . 
  3 ) [ malham cove ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malham_cove ) - a place i have been to many times , and still love . 
  a sheer limestone cliff face , that was a waterfall in the last ice age . 
  very impressive , and the top has large areas of [ limestone pavements ] ( http://www.warringtonramblers.talktalk.net/mal7.jpg ) to explore . 
  4 ) [ humber bridge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humber_bridge ) - opened in 1981 , this impressive bridge spans the [ humber estuary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humber ) and comes in at 2,220 m ( 7,280 ft ) in length . 
  well worth the toll fare across . 
  5 ) [ pontefract castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pontefract_castle ) - often overlooked by tourists with york being close by , but worth a visit . 
  it was slighted after the last english civil war in the 17th century but the ruins are still impressive . 
  you can explore the cellars , which are daubed with graffiti from soldiers taking part in the last siege . 
  formerly a royal palace ( along with nearby [ sandal castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sandal_castle ) ) , and is likely the location where richard ii was murdered - which is alluded to in shakespeare 's play richard iii . 
  6 ) [ york ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/york ) - well , what can i say ? 
  there is something for ( nearly ? ), 
  everyone in york . 
  from winding streets filled with shops , the minster , the castle museum , york dungeon , national railway museum , city walls ... if you have n't been , please do . 
  try getting off the beaten track and exploring the snickleways and less-loved parts of town . 
  7 ) [ the entire craven district ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craven ) - an area of the historic west riding of yorkshire , the scenery is breathtaking and there are many quaint villages and places to visit ( including bolton abbey ) . 
  you may have seen a lot of this area in the tour de france recently . 
  tomatoes work too , unless you prefer whizzing on people . 
  what 's happening in finland ? 
  even if labour win the next ge , he will be 71 . who is being groomed in the wings ? 
  [ a little more complex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scotland_during_the_roman_empire ) , the scoti were later players to the game ( from hibernia ) - mostly it was iron age tribes that were conquered/controlled by the picts . 
  the toilet is still broken , back to work !, 
  aye , ze germans did a good job of [ bombing the shit out of it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hull_blitz ) . 
  its terrorist training camps are full . 
  my great grandfather on my father 's side survived the trenches ( as did his 3 brothers ) . 
  he was captured in late 1918 by the germans during the hundred days offensive . 
  sorry , wobbled off course there . 
  just how the polish seem to be trying to make a go of becoming part of the local community , rather than being insular and being alienated ( which can lead to all sorts of problems , as witnessed in other local areas to me such as bradford , dewsbury where youngsters there have actually gone to syria or blown themselves up ) . 
  run down ( used to be a fine road with medieval/georgian & victorian buildings until the 1960 's ) , full of budget shops and pawn shops ( the latter that attract the dodgy types who sell on their stolen goods ) . 
  it backs onto a few run down housing areas ( one almost exclusively muslim , the other a mix of eastern european/african ) . 
  it feels a bit stabby just walking through it , and there is a notorious subway where many of the local residents drink alcohol after dark and where several attacks/rapes have occurred ( also the station until recently was one of the worst in england , [ though it has been restored ] ( http://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/news/local-news/kirkgate-station-officially-open-after-multi-million-pound-renovation-1-7460160 ) ) . 
  ps - this is [ wakefield , yorkshire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wakefield ) - not london , 
  now the settled poles near me loath the new waves of migrants from kosovo , africa & the middle east . 
  come visit wakefield , yorkshire . 
  hang around the [ \\ ( lower \\ ) kirkgate area ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/wakefield,+west+yorkshire/@53.6826083,-1.4940773,192m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x48795d6047fb0b31:0x71697d7cd4b2dac8 ) , or the city centre after dark - it 's getting pretty creepy out there . 
  the most racist thing i heard regarding ` darkies ' as she called them was from a 75 year old serbian lady who has lived in england since the 70 's , complaining how they just loiter around , do no work and expect handouts . 
  she advised me and wifey to emigrate to australia or new zealand , lol . 
  usually the ones with potential mature after a visit to university . 
  though , the internet means instead of having their opinions challenged they can flock to damp subs and other such holes for confirmation bias and echo chambers . 
  or usa , perhaps just a giant french and spanish colony ? 
  what of all the technological developments made in the uk ? 
  i guess monkeys and typewriters . 
  not really , but there are a lot more more people in ruk than scotland . 
  onus is on the snp to deliver what they promised . 
  people will change their vote just as swiftly as they did from labour to snp if they do not . 
  hating the tories is simply not enough to carry on winning majorities . 
  it is just one of many sources to use , stitch them all together to create the blanket ( albeit full of holes ) of information . 
  sounds like 1945 repeating , with a little less communism . 
  nicely put . 
  i am from yorkshire , and when i have heard danish chaps speaking english ( when playing games/skype/etc ) it sounds like they could be from the east riding of yorkshire to me . 
  one could argue you are overplaying their roles . 
  posting raw footage will tell it 's own story , sans the editorial aspect and agenda . 
  clamp down on those posting titles such as ` this video proves xxx , shows xxx in action ' but allow ' a video from xxx on xxx , relating to xxx ' . 
  never trust the media ( no matter what outlet it is , you will be amazed how even individual journalists pad out the facts to push an agenda or just make a story more interesting ) , use varying sources to shed light on the actual event . 
  looking at the shadow can give you a rough idea of what is casting it , minus the definition ( only truly done by visiting the area in focus yourself ) . 
  why are you terrified specifically ? 
  [ airey neave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airey_neave ) was going to sort this clusterfuck out , and fully integrate it into the uk . 
  alas , he died - [ consipracists like to point the blame at the usa who 's ultimate goal is a united ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airey_neave#conspiracy_theories ) . 
  where do you live ?
