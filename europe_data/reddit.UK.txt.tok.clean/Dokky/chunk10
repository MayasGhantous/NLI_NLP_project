  the total bias of / r/unitedkingdom and / r/scotland has proudly been displayed ( the latter especially in complete denial of the 1,000,000 who voted to ` leave ' ) . 
  i love your username, 
  this is too much fun . 
  you are living in a deluded reality , probably all that buckfast we send up north to keep you all pissed . 
  side effects of chastising a bunch of irish immigrants i guess . 
  yeah , the scots are subsidy junkies, 
  mmm !, 
   everyone ? 
  the uk has fewer migrants than spain , norway , switzerland , belgium , latvia and many others ; ( source ) . 
  for non-eu nationals they are third , included eu nationals ( ie total ) they are second ...  britain is poorer than most parts of germany , denmark , sweden , the netherlands , switzerland , austria , luxembourg , and northern italy ( map ) . 
  so why do migrants keep coming here ? 
  both from outside the eu and inside the eu ? 
  so brave, 
  here are some figures regarding muslim populations of european cities : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_the_european_union_by_muslim_population also , regarding the growth of islam : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muslim_population_growth#europe, 
  which is in the eu ... 
  sigh , eu is less than 23 years old . 
  that is the point for many wanting to leave , that the original treaty of rome has morphed into this bloated , inept entity that will get fatter and less able to shed light on its own direction and destiny . 
  do n't forget to actually vote too .

  what an embarrassment , should scrap this political freak show . 
  made by russians : /, 
  a bit like world of warships not having the royal navy ( except two premium ships you have to purchase , one being an american-built destroyer ) .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/know_nothing anti-catholicism ( not simply anti-irishness , protestants were received very well ) came to the forefront after mass immigration began , around the time of the famine . 
  my thoughts are with you my swedish brethren . 
  yes it does , there are distilleries in northern ireland .

  oh stop telling everyone missetheldreda/ethelbutt/whatever you call yourself next . 
  move on , i mean you left for sweden from wiltshire , if not to escape your past for a fresh start ? 
  do n't follow your father down such a toxic path to misery and regret . 
  so what exactly is xenophobic , because argentina and spain both speak spanish , or comparing gibraltar to the falkland islands ? 
  or both ? 
  yes , defending the rights of [ gibraltarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltarians ) is xenophobic . 
  this is exactly the issue , your empahsis ( which is exactly what the media is doing ) . 
  here 's michael howard 's wiki article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_howard  howard was born michael hecht in gorseinon , swansea . 
  he is the son of bernat hecht , who was born in romania and came to britain in 1939 . 
  his mother , hilda ( kershion ) , lived in wales from the age of 6 months . 
  both of howard 's parents were from jewish families . 
  when howard was six , his parents became naturalised as british subjects ( now called british citizens ) , and his surname was also changed following the parents ' naturalisation with the new surname howard . 
  for the love of christ , here is a transcript of the actual interview ( a fucking sky news interviews at that ... ) : https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/media-packs/2017/sophy-ridge-on-sunday-interview-with-lord-howard,-former-conservative-leader,-20417 and here is a parody of a media feeding frenzy building mountains out of molehills : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3bo6gp9nmy, 
  fairly sure the uk has controlled gibraltar longer than the kingdom of spain has . 
  fuck , the moors controlled it for the longest period . 
  steady on general franco, 
  the 19th ? 
  i think it offends anyone who knows the difference between the eu and europe . 
  so then , by your standards all non-eu european countries should fly the flag ? 
  i mean , russia and turkey territory in europe ... 
  they can call it the ` flag of europe ' but in reality it does not represent all of europe , does it ? 
  it has no right but it has might , and has proven it will use it regarding the ukraine . 
  [ there are only 8 other islands in the world bigger than great britain fyi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_islands_by_area#islands_.2818_total.29_100.2c000.c2.a0km2_.2839.2c000.c2.a0sq.c2.a0mi.29_and_greater ) . 
  i think russia wo n't allow it , get your mp 's to ask putin . 
  it 's the flag of the eu , not europe, 
  perhaps because / r/scotland is pro indy when the last referendum and current polls say otherwise , almost as if reddit is not representative of reality and national subreddits tend to be echo chambers filled with younger people, 
  yes , for low-skilled economic migrants . 
  it has nothing to do with a travel ban on anyone entering the uk or uk nationals travelling around europe . 
  very interesting that this was made 2 years ago and posted there . 
   leaving eu means not wanting to travel to europe and/or not wanting to let europeans in your country ( or at least restricting the ability to do so significantly ) so it does say a lot about your view on culture and people of europe wat, 
  ruined by being labelled in french,

  epic hangovers all around by sunday !, 
  plenty do , whether they are part of the following or not ( this is for the island of great britain so excludes ni ) : * 6,000,000 with at least 25 % irish ancestry ( 10 % of the british population ) * 14,000,000 with less than 25 % irish ancestry ( 25 % of the british population ) also st patrick was born in roman britain , exactly where no one is 100 % sure ( possibly what is now cumbria in england or wales ) . 
  stooping to a new low, 
  so i finally found something , only one source so it is what it is : http://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lord-ashcroft-polls-referendum-day-poll-summary-1409191.pdf seems eu membership was quite low down in people 's priorities for how they voted . 
  does n't sound very good for the average tax payer . 
  just after the evidence people voted ` no ' in the scottish referendum because of the eu , maybe you should climb off your high horse ? 
  still no evidence ? 
  just after some evidence of the claim , that 's all . 
  i did and did n't find anything , please show me the evidence . 
  not much info on the article to scrutinise and debate ... 
  i 'd love to re-discover pictish and cumbric in some dead sea scroll-esque way . 
  pictish covered what is now scotland before being supplanted by the ` invaders ' language ( scottish gaelic ) . 
  cumbric bridged the gap between wales and scotland in the north of england . 
  siege mentality is part of gibraltars identity , more recently it was surrounded by a fascist regime for several decades . 
  in your dreams , 
  i too am sat in europe , in a booming economy . 
  until the next global crash that is , such is the enslaved existence we call life . 
  so what is modern celtic culture then that ` unifies ' the so-called celtic nations ( apart from anglophobia ) ? 
  just sat here in [ hen ogledd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hen_ogledd ) , amazed the sun is out . 
  do n't worry , one way or another change is on the horizon !, 
  indeed , and it was celtic culture ( from mainland europe ) that was imported rather than celtic peoples . 
  my own ancestry research is a pain in the arse , they keep moving to and fro from ulster to scotland . 
  ` punching above your weight for 300 years ' syndrome i think . 
  yep . 
  i find it ironic many then went to ulster as planters . 
  can england join your racial celtic union ? 
  given that there about the same number in england of irish descent as the total irish population ? 
  and what of the [ anglo-irish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-irish_people ) , [ hiberno-normans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normans_in_ireland ) , etc. . . 
  i 'll add that the picts were the celtic ` natives ' , and their language ( pictish ) was a brittonic language ( like cornish/welsh/cumbric ) and not goidelic like irish/manx . 
  just another program like ventrillo/teamspeak/skype / etc.
