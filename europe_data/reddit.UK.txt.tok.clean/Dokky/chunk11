   there has been speculation that the current heir apparent to the british throne , charles , prince of wales , may elect not to be known as `` charles iii '' out of concern about comparisons with charles ii of england ( who was known as a playboy ) , charles i of england ( who was executed after the english civil war ) and the jacobite memory of the `` young pretender '' charles edward stuart ( who claimed the title `` charles iii '' ) . 
  he may instead choose to be known as george vii in honour of his grandfather . 
  however , the prince has not as yet announced any decision . 
  his full name is charles philip arthur george .

  paid off for her in the end :  chile was officially neutral during the falklands war , but chile 's westinghouse long range radar that was deployed in the south of the country gave the british task force early warning of argentinian air attacks . 
  this allowed british ships and troops in the war zone to take defensive action . 
  [ 74 ] margaret thatcher , the british prime minister at the time of the war , said that the day the radar was taken out of service for overdue maintenance was the day argentinian fighter-bombers bombed the troopships sir galahad and sir tristram , leaving 53 dead and many injured . 
  according to chilean junta member and former air force commander , general fernando matthei , chilean support included military intelligence gathering , radar surveillance , allowing british aircraft to operate with chilean colours , and facilitating the safe return of british special forces , among other forms of assistance . 
  [ 75 ]  in april and may 1982 , a squadron of mothballed british hawker hunter fighter-bombers departed for chile , arriving on 22 may and allowing the chilean air force to reform the no . 
  a further consignment of three frontier surveillance and shipping reconnaissance canberras left for chile in october . 
  some authors have speculated that argentina might have won the war had the military felt able to employ the elite vith and viiith mountain brigades , which remained sitting in the andes guarding against possible chilean incursions .

  this economic crisis was due to the rapidly increasing costs of government and to the overwhelming costs incurred by fighting two major wars : the seven years ' war and the american revolutionary war .
