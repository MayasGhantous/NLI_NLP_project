  ** survey of non-british workers ** the uk 's diverse and multinational workforce plays a critical role in its economic evolution . 
  to understand perceptions of the uk as a place to work and live we surveyed over 2,000 non-british workers , half based here and half outside the uk . 
  ** key findings : ** * the uk is the most favoured global destination , ahead of the us , australia and canada - almost 9 out of 10 rank the uk as quite or highly attractive * job opportunities and diversity are seen as key strengths of the uk * brexit has shifted perceptions - for those based outside the uk , 21 per cent now find the uk less attractive , compared to 48 per cent for those based here * overall , 36 per cent of non-british workers based here are considering leaving in the next five years * high-skilled eu workers are most likely to leave - 47 per cent over the next five years * there are regional and sectorial variances in the perceptions of workers -- for example , in the northern powerhouse region 21 per cent are considering leaving , compared to 59 per cent in london * the uk could be faced with a potential skills shortage - high-skill workers are most mobile and therefore in the short term there is likely to be a greater pressure to fill these vacancies * there is a connection between the concentration of non-british workers in certain sectors and the likelihood of automation * the three sectors with the highest numbers of eu workers are among those with the greatest potential for automation https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/international-markets/articles/power-up.html https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/deloitte/uk/documents/international-markets/deloitte-uk-power-up.pdf,

  obligatory wikipedia article : * [ prince philip , duke of edinburgh \\ ( philip mountbatten ; born prince philip of greece and denmark , 10 june 1921 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_philip,_duke_of_edinburgh )  a member of the house of schleswig-holstein-sonderburg-gl\u00fccksburg , philip was born into the greek and danish royal families . 
  he was born in greece , but his family was exiled from the country when he was an infant . 
  after being educated in france , germany , and the united kingdom , he joined the royal navy in 1939 , aged 18 . 
  from july 1939 , he began corresponding with the 13-year-old princess elizabeth ( his third cousin through queen victoria of the united kingdom and second cousin once removed through king christian ix of denmark ) , whom he had first met in 1934 . 
  during the second world war he served with the mediterranean and pacific fleets . 
  the son ( francis john fane marmion dymoke ) is an accountant ( born 1955 ) , the father ( john lindley marmion dymoke ) was a lt colonel who fought in the malaya emergency and indonesian confrontation ( born 1926 , died 2015 ) . 
  i am a fan of promoting the historic counties , i believe it is an important part of our heritage .

  [ here 's a map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/english_counties_1851_with_ridings.svg ) of the ancient counties of england . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historic_counties_of_england there is a lot more information here , at the association of british counties : http://abcounties.com/, 
   the flag was registered by the flag institute on 23 may 2013 as the winning entry in a competition organised in conjunction with it . 
  ** the flag features a `` rose-en-soleil '' device first used by edward iv upon his accession to the throne , combining the white rose of the house of york with the sun emblem used by his royal predecessor , richard ii . 
  ** in essence the rose-en-soleil is a more elaborate version of the white rose emblem associated with the county and had been used by the former west riding council in its coat of arms . 
  the rose emblem is placed against an offset red cross in scandinavian style , reflecting the anglo-scandinavian history of the region during the era when the ridings were first established . 
  the cross may be seen therefore as a nordic cross in english colours , a graphic encapsulation of local heritage and history . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_and_symbols_of_yorkshire#ridings * [ west riding of yorkshire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_riding_of_yorkshire )  the west riding encompasses 1,771,562 acres ( 7,169 km \u00b2 ) from sheffield in the south to sedbergh in the north and from dunsop bridge in the west to adlingfleet in the east . 
   unlike most english counties that were divided into hundreds , yorkshire , being so large , was divided first into thrithjungar ( an old norse word meaning ` third parts ' ) , which were called the three ridings ( east , north and west ) and , later , the city of york ( which lay within the city walls and was not part of any riding ) . 
  each riding was then divided into wapentakes , a division comparable to the hundreds of southern england and the wards of england 's four northern-most historic counties . 
  the wapentakes of the west riding were agbrigg and morley , barkston ash , ewcross , claro , osgoldcross , skyrack , staincliffe , staincross , strafforth and tickhill . 
  \u2022 created : historic riding - ad889 , administrative county - 1889 \u2022 abolished : historic riding - not abolished , administrative county - 1974 \u2022 succeeded by : west yorkshire , south yorkshire , north yorkshire , lancashire , cumbria , greater manchester , humberside,
