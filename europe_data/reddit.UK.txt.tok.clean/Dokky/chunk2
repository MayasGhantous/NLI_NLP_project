  nice , had an uncle who fought the japanese in burma then the communists in malaya !, 
  nice bit of research , ta !, 
  may i ask where your grandfather was from ? 
  you can gladly take dewsbury , rotherham and ravensthorpe . 
   following the end of the second world war , the british nationality act 1948 was passed to allow the 800 million subjects in the british empire to live and work in the united kingdom without needing a visa . 
  also , could you link the article , seems a very low figure . 
  like with lisbon and ireland ? 
  ah , some european ( french poster ) brit hating . 
  i love it it , 
  the newly built civic hall in leeds , yorkshire , 1933 . 
  * [ photo 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vzy4fz3.jpg ) * [ photo 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mxr4hfe.jpg ) it was built from [ portland stone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portland_stone ) , and contrasts greatly with the soot-blackened buildings surrounding it . 
  shattered hand started out british & dutch , then swedish took it over . 
  not hate , just ... exasperation at 12 year old swedes spamming chat , being idiots , etc ( hence the moniker , swetard ) , 
  sorry , i used to play wow on shattered hand eu . 
  even my swedish guildies would facepalm at the general chat in orgrimmar ... 
  aye , first one is brilliant . 
  others , not so . 
  * ' [ les yeuxs sans visage ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053459/ ) ' ( french ) . 
  * ' [ zwartboek ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389557/ ) ' ( dutch ) . 
  watch these if you have n't !, 
  and the rain ... so much rain , raindrops the size of marbles . 
  it was glorious . 
  birth control , not zyklon b showers . 
  what 's your beef with the uk ? 
  at least we 're not a former province of sweden and russia / s looks pretty , is it midge infested in the summer ? 
  only finns i know are through online gaming , and they were always pissed ( but generally skilled !, 
  aye , the foresty commission in the uk ( set up after wwi when the forest cover was at it lowest ) initially planted regimented areas of spruce/fir . 
  over the last 30 years they have been addressing the issue , one notable area is [ kielder forest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kielder_forest ) . 
  kleftiko is tasty !, 
  oh thanks , apologies for my ignorance !, 
  i like italian , mostly from watching inspector montalbano ( just saw the the young montalbano recently as well ) . 
  16th century cottage & shop : http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/34927568?search_identifier=ecb9a486a2f111700e8a161ce0113dc6#looigdgvfuegfgpk.97 or for a more standard type : http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/37509475?search_identifier=ecb9a486a2f111700e8a161ce0113dc6#z2lub7zixad5egfm.97, 
  an australian riding an asian animal ? 
  i do not like baked beans , i only waste them when the person cooking my breakfast puts them on regardless . 
  an older one : * [ airey neave assassination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airey_neave#conspiracy_theories ), 
  aye , just as long as we do n't post immigration topics outside the megathread . 
  why is the sub ` flooded ' as you say ? 
  perhaps because it is a major concern of many citizens of the eu and their governments ? 
  it 's okay , let 's just keep the flood of anti-russian posts coming instead . 
  sort your flag out canada , [ this design ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/1946_canadian_flag_proposal.svg ) should have been adopted !, 
  [ aye ] ( https://appraisaltodayblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/monkeys-see-hear-no-evil.jpg ), 
  they shaped , along with the ussr , the fate of the world post-wwii . 
  and it was the political and armed forced administrations that did so , not the common men and women . 
  blame the usa , if anyone . 
  the uk and france were bankrupt and effectively told not to meddle ( see yalta/potsdam - final nail in the coffin was suez crisis ) . 
  yet the ire of the eastern europeans ( and lets sweep under the carpet collaborationists with the nazis and soviets ) is directed firmly at western europe . 
  countries that bled and bankrupted themselves on the premise of polish autonomy - and were told to stfu about that niggling point in 1945 . 
  poles are a distinct ethic group ? 
  i thought their constitution allows each individual to decide ( a personal matter ) ? 
  have read all his books , they are very balanced and easy to read , often extremely harrowing . 
  stalingrad followed by berlin are absolute musts for anyone who wants to get the human aspect of the battles . 
  an anecdote from stalingrad that has been permanently burned in my mind was a german with no legs , being pulled on a sled by a kubelwagon to the airlift inside the kessell , when they were surrounded by the soviets . 
  he kept falling off , and not wanting to hold the others up , just told them to leave him at the side of the road . 
  u wot, 
  rain-drenched iberian immigrants ? 
  this is how the world has always worked . 
  click the link , the offer was proposed by france during suez and eventually declined by the uk . 
  interestingly , it was uk [ declining a franco-british union/joining the commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-british_union#suez_crisis_.281956.29 ) that helped push germany & france closer together . 
  as for de gaulle , he was a loathsome army commander and politician to many members of the allied forces who had interactions with him ( though certainly not as loathsome as bernard montgomery !, 
  and the tourists :p, 
  if the eu sorts * it 's * shit out ( ie euro , immigration , block on new members - mainly turkey ) then no . 
  if not , then yes . 
  are the moderators blind to this clusterfuck and utter failure of containment ? 
  get your fucking house in order ... and then realise it is everyone 's house and you are mere custodians . 
  the whole megathread issue has been disgraceful . 
  moderation failure is to blame here , they are trying to shoehorn it into one ` simple ' thread and ban everything else to ease their woes . 
  let 's just bask in that for a second , the needs of the few outweighing the needs of the many . 
  why will this cabal of the elite not simply add more members to spread the load ? 
  why are such a concentrated few users moderators of such a plethora of subreddits ? 
  * i * do not want a ` megathread ' to stuff the * entire * issue into . 
  simple as that . 
  it is a multi-faceted subject . 
  not just here ( which is a left-leaning hubris factory ) , in the wider world more tumescently . 
  the subject is present , but the discussion is scant . 
  just like this post and yours , lacking substance . 
  because the discussion is vehemently suppressed . 
  as i have previously posted , the left ( and ergo this sub ) have the attitude of : ` see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil ', 
  [ ja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zikchnimsxk ), 
  soylent green ... is dss ? 
  ownage 4 u !, 
  another ? 
  okay . 
   immigration discussion contained . 
   there . 
   ` see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil '  50 ( +6 ) countries , 230 languages , 743m people ... 1 subreddit .

  ps europe looked different back then as well . 
  here is a tiny snippet of [ east anglia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/williamson_p16_3.svg/1166px-williamson_p16_3.svg.png ) . 
  is greece full of communists again ? 
  your relic of the sultan is likely to go first ... 
  i mean , syria , let 's just ignore that . 
  worked out well today ? 
  i see , so a uk national questioning your motives , and i am branded the entire history of people 's from these sceptred isles . 
  and :  i sense a little gallipoli butthurt . 
  is pure crass , bordering on bad taste . 
  you do know how many ottomans died there ? 
  attaturk 's legacy is in ruins , soon you will be swarmed . 
  my designs ?
