  no need when you have weaker economies dragging it down for you, 
  every greek needs a merc !, 
  once the euro gets to a high enough level their exports suffer . 
  that is why germany wanted the euro in the first place ? 
  devalue their currency to export everywhere ?

  indeed , the ` left ' are terrified of being branded xenophobic/racist , and can not fathom a point of view that is not their own , and duly label anything else xenophobic/racist . 
  a very peculiar situation . 
  and this is the problem , assuming it is so polarised there are only two sides of the debate . 
  it is complex and nuanced , it needs to happen - ignoring it because it is difficult and emotive will not help anyone . 
  it is often a knee-jerk reaction to the fear of being branded racist , no debate happens . 
  let 's just ignore the discussion , because people are not comfortable with it .

  a plaque at the site of the massacre , placed in 1978 , quotes a verse from isaiah ( yeshaya 42.12 ) : `` they shall proclaim to g-d glory and praise in the islands '' .

  the cherem ( likely a myth , and never actually implemented ) on jews staying overnight in york was only lifted in 1990 ... 800 years after the massacre at clifford 's tower that lead to it . 
   isolated attacks on jews also occurred at colchester , thetford , and ospringe , but the most striking incident occurred at york on the night of march 16 ( shabbat hagadol , the shabbat before passover ) and 17 march 1190 . 
  [ 5 ] the jews of york were alarmed by the preceding massacres and by the setting on fire of several of their houses by the anti-jewish rioting in the wake of religious fervour during crusaders ' preparations for the third crusade against the saracens , led by richard . 
  their leader josce asked the warden of york castle to receive them with their wives and children , and they were accepted into clifford 's tower . 
  however , the tower was besieged by the mob of crusaders , demanding that the jews convert to christianity and be baptized . 
  trapped in the castle , the jews were advised by their religious leader , rabbi yomtov of joigney , to kill themselves rather than convert ; josce began by slaying his wife anna and his two children , and then was killed by yomtov . 
  the father of each family killed his wife and children , before yomtob and josce set fire to the wooden keep , killing themselves . 
  [ 6 ] the handful of jews who did not kill themselves died in the fire , or were murdered by rioters .
