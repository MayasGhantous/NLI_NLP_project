  napoleon informed me it is ok . 
  aye , very interesting :  the construction work creating a new leeds railway station followed the stipulation of an act of parliament that allowed the old cemetery to be bisected but only upon a solid embankment . 
  if the railway had been built upon a viaduct of brick with foundations ( as to the west of the churchyard ) , many recent graves would have been destroyed inserted within living memory . 
  more fascinating still , the displaced memorials were laid out on the incline of the embankment to denote their relationship their original graves , now buried metres below them !, 
  i thought , without reading the heritage board , that they were simply moved to the embankment as an edge to the flat cemetery space cleared to make the park . 
  their role to invoke , if not accurately , then symbolically , the still-present dead sealed beneath the embankment , explains why the rows of slabs rise up the bank at an angle , rather than 90 degrees from the contour . 
  it was quite common for old monuments/buildings to be robbed and the materials reused . 
  easier digging out and carting nice dressed masonry rather than quarrying it yourself !, 
  it can be an early indicator of a long since vanished structure checking out any reused material on existing structures in a locale .

  opposite [ leeds parish church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leeds_minster ) ( now leeds minster ) was a graveyard . 
  a railway was built through the middle of it , [ and the headstones were used to shore up the embankment ] ( https://howardwilliamsblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2635.jpg?w=614 ) .

  the benefits system already is so flawed it practically encourages fraud and not working ( want to work full time ? 
  oh you earn less doing 40 hours than doing 15 and keeping your housing benefit ) it would be lovely to tailor a system to each individual case , but would you be willing to pay more for the bureaucracy than the actual moving being given out ? 
  what is it with this echo chamber circlekerk that believes a law scarped must therefore herald in it 's polar opposite ?
