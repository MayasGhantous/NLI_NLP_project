  i guess the russians feel like it is, 
  sabre rattling on both sides , off the coast of russia . 
  from bradford ... 
  i guess productivity is king . 
  read last week his niece lived nearby . 
  what republic are you on now btw ? 
   in pre-roman times , cornwall was part of the kingdom of dumnonia , and was later known to the anglo-saxons as `` west wales '' , to distinguish it from `` north wales '' ( modern-day wales ) . 
  the very name cornwall ( the wall part ) derives from wales also ( which means foreigner ) . 
  [ allied troops landed at archangel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_russia_intervention ), 
  russian civil war , turkish war of independence ,, 
  / r/cringe thanking the french for assistance in a rebellion that lead to the [ acts of union ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acts_of_union_1800 ) thanking germans for providing weapons whilst irishmen were being slaughtered by the very same germans ? 
  thanking the americans ... who then went on the fund the pira ... 
  indeed , / r/cringe, 
  there was a war on !, 
  cornwall used to be known as west wales . 
  originally marked around the left cheek and chin , but them gerrymandered to include the full head and neck . 
  okay . 
  you can have his body , we 'll take head ? 
  you have to admit though , accepting an obe as an irish nationalist is quite an odd thing to do . 
  look at what happened when pat mccarthy accepted an mbe . 
  seems to be an issue of an export license . 
  read the article folks !, 
   `` we are told that the national arts council considers this ring part of those objects with , and i quote ` high national symbolic value ' and as such should have part of a special legislation . ''  according to the demand , on purchasing the ring the puy de fou park should have obtained a ** special export licence necessary under european regulations ** . 
   the uk has strict guidelines for exporting items of national and historical importance , and requires a license for any antiques that are worth more than # 39,219 and have been in the country for more than 50 years . 
  obtaining the licence is the responsibility of the exporter , not the auction house , and the process takes around a month . 
   if the licence is deferred , a uk buyer then has an opportunity to match the price . 
   auction house timeline 's managing director , brett hammond , told art newspaper : `` we handed over the ring to the buyer 's solicitors in london on 3 march . 
  we also gave them a letter , which they signed for , advising them that the ring would need a uk export licence . ''  a spokeswoman for arts council england , which oversees the export regulations , said that `` the application process is confidential ; however , given the age and price of the item , its export would require an individual licence '' . 
  so , french breaking eu rules . 
  he does have an obe though . 
  let 's both claim him !, 
  mentally unstable young woman ( had visions from angels/saints ) who fought the english , was captured by burgundian soldiers , put on trial by a french bishop ( same french bishop who took the ring off her ) and burned at the stake . 
  thanks our canadian overlord of europe . 
  remember reading about this when it happened . 
  silly terrorist colonial needs to go back to school !, 
   i shall be meditating in front of the [ bill of rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bill_of_rights_1689 ) until your return . 
  democracy in action , you may not be used to it , 
   you will submit to our terms or fuck off . 
  roll on june :d, 
  idle threats ? 
  i have seen many banded around , yet this is the first time the uk electorate will actually have a say about continued eu membership . 
  let democracy do the talking i guess . 
  dig up de gaulle , he can have another go . 
  edit : seems we have a new pretender , [ emmanuel macron ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35712463 ) . 
  ah , i understand now . 
  thanks for clarifying that for me . 
  i was under the impression post-legislative was referring to the fact the uk was already part of the eu , i.e. 
  the legislation had already passed for the uk 's membership, 
  we are currentley part of the eu, 
  indeed , eec membership referendum was post-legislative in 1975 , the forthcoming referendum will be the first regarding continued eu membership , again post-legislative . 
   the european economic community ( eec ) was a regional organisation which aimed to bring about economic integration between its member states . 
  it was created by the treaty of rome of 1957 . 
  upon the formation of the european union ( eu ) in 1993 , the eec was incorporated and renamed as the european community ( ec ) . 
  in 2009 the ec 's institutions were absorbed into the eu 's wider framework and the community ceased to exist . 
  that 's arranged marriages for you, 
  * cottage pie = beef mince * shepherds pie = lamb mince, 
  glorious . 
  north yorkshire ( except middlesbrough ) would likely agree , especially harrogate !, 
  good job populist views have little to do with the day to day running of the eu then, 
  based on that informed response , the uk might as well leave !, 
  fighting / hostile to / good relations, 
  ` cultural differences ', 
  also the jockeying between the two over the middle east,

  just because you 're paranoid does n't mean they 're not after you . 
  good job this sub ( indeed most of reddit ) is as representative of the real world as a meth addled grandmother riding a stone cock whilst intravenously taking absinthe followed by a speedball enema . 
  the unspoken curse of demon drink in the uk ... 
  i mean europe ... 
  i mean the entire world . 
  reasonable uk ? 
  do as we require , not as your populace wants ? 
  paranoid , yes !, 
  i mean , have you seen what goes on over the channel . 
  i thought it was fucked up over here ( politically speaking ) : s, 
  yes , franco-german overlord ship will have no further barriers, 
  he 's greek :p, 
  i am agreeing with you ... 
  not sure i understand what you mean . 
  we should stay in the eu because our own government is ` incompetent ' according to you ? 
  maybe it is a little , but the economy is strong and we do n't have unemployment along the lines of incompetent nations such as spain , greece , italy , etc. 
  meh - i love my european brothers and sisters just do n't want to share a flat with you . 
  * more terrorist attacks * plenty of riots * iran declares war on saudi arabia * russia declares war on turkey * angela merkel assassinated by a french muslim * only kitten pics allowed to be posted in / r/europe, 
  yes , and i am not a spokesman for the queen either . 
  some people just can not get over their racist views . 
  sure , okay ta . 
  the eu 's currently heading for disaster anyway . 
  incompetent leadership , lack of unified direction and individual greed amongst member states is to blame . 
  it was a refuge for all those who managed to escape here and join her armed forces . 
   forasmuch as almighty god hath in all ages showed his power and mercy in the miraculous and gracious deliverance of his church , and in the protection of religious kings and states , and that no nation of the earth hath been blessed with greater benefit than this kingdom now enjoyeth , having the same true and free profession of the gospel under our most gracious sovereign lord king james , the most great learned and religious king that ever reigned therein , enriched with a most helpful and plentiful progeny proceeding out of his royal loins promising continuance of this happiness and profession to all posterity : the which many malignant and devilish papists , jesuits , and seminary priests much envying and fearing , conspired most horribly , when the king 's most excellent majesty , the queen , the prince , and the lords spiritual and temporal , and commons , should have been assembled in the upper house of parliament upon the fifth day of november in the year of our lord 1605 suddenly to have blown up the said house with gunpowder , an invention so inhuman , barbarous and cruel , as the like was never before heard of . 
  like oliver cromwell ? 
  that would be lovely . 
  great speech . 
  aye , i mean in the uk plenty of people put their religion as ` jedi ' on census forms . 
  aye , stuck between a rock ( ussr ) and a hard place ( nazi germany ) !, 
  fancy handing calais back ? 
  we 'll reinstate the city walls , send over all the edl/britain first/national front/bnp types to man the ramparts / s,
