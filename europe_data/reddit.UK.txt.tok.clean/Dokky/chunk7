   at least one in three people ( ~ 1.8 million ) on the island of ireland can understand irish to some extent . 
  estimates of fully native speakers range from 40,000 up to 80,000 people . 
   beck was surprised when britain , looking for a pretext to confront germany , announced at the end of march 1939 it would defend poland from germany attack . 
  france joined in , but both countries knew there was very little they could do if germany invaded poland . 
   similarly , beck refused a demand from soviets and delivered by great britain to allow soviet forces to enter the country , which was made in talks in which polish side did not take part . 
   a third proposal soon followed , once again elaborated by great britain , which promised support to the polish government if the country 's borders were endangered . 
  this time around , beck accepted it . 
   in summer 1939 great britain and france also sought a defensive military alliance with soviet union . 
  one reason it failed is that beck refused to allow any soviet military movement through poland . 
   hitler shifted to the soviet union , and secured the molotov-ribbentrop pact in august 1939 . 
  it secured soviet neutrality in a war , a heavy flow of soviet food and oil , and an agreement to partition poland and split up the baltic states . 
  everyone realized that war between germany and poland was imminent .

  bring out the [ halifax gibbet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halifax_gibbet ) !, 
  * [ british burma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_rule_in_burma )  burma is sometimes referred to as `` the scottish colony '' , due to the heavy role played by scotsmen in colonising and running the country , one of the most notable being sir james scott , and the irrawaddy flotilla company . 
   the idea that we 're ethnically different and that much culturally different was hijacked yes , a part of history ... why do people assume a whitewash because of a british flair ? 
  could it be ... something to do with the very subject at hand . . 
   henry ford his father , william ford ( 1826 -- 1905 ) , was born in county cork , ireland , to a family that was originally from somerset , england , [ 4 ] his mother , mary ford ( n\u00e9e litogot ) ( 1839 -- 1876 ) , was born in michigan as the youngest child of belgian immigrants ; her parents died when she was a child and she was adopted by neighbors , the o'herns . 
  so , not very ? 
  and david cameron 's father was . 
  aye , historical recollection hijacked for political means . 
  shame really . 
  have just purchased a large ( 1/4 brown scuffler ) hot beef and onion sandwich with horseradish & gravy for # 2.80 , from my local butcher . 
  beef dripping used instead of butter on the bread . 
   a jack-o ' - lantern ( or jack o'lantern ) is a carved pumpkin or turnip lantern , associated with the holiday of halloween and named after the phenomenon of a strange light flickering over peat bogs , called will-o ' - the-wisp or jack-o ' - lantern . 
   it is believed that the custom of making jack-o ' - lanterns at halloween began in ireland and britain . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] in the 19th century , `` turnips or mangel wurzels , hollowed out to act as lanterns and often carved with grotesque faces '' , were used at halloween in parts of ireland and the scottish highlands . 
  [ 8 ] in these celtic-speaking regions , halloween was also the festival of samhain and was seen as a time when supernatural beings ( the aos s\u00ed ) , and the souls of the dead , roamed the earth . 
  the belief that the souls of the dead roamed the earth at halloween was also found in other parts of europe . 
  jack-o ' - lanterns were also made at halloween in somerset ( see punkie night ) during the 19th century . 
   the referendum came just three days after the french referendum on the constitution resulted in its rejection . 
  because all eu member states needed to ratify the treaty for it to take effect , some regarded the dutch referendum as irrelevant . 
  however , dutch campaigners for a `` yes '' vote appealed to the electorate to avoid damaging the netherlands ' standing in europe in the way that the french result was perceived , in some quarters , to have weakened the position of france . 
  before the plebiscite , many `` no '' campaigners expressed the view that french rejection of the treaty would encourage dutch voters to follow suit . 
  a second `` no '' vote in a referendum in one of the founding countries of the project of european integration was widely regarded as having the power to `` kill off '' the treaty . 
  opinion polls in the days leading up to the referendum gave the `` no '' campaign a clear lead . 
  so , someone linked me this earlier , thoughts everyone ? 
   this level of tribal politics is exactly the reason why europe is n't yet ready for further integration . 
  a union of nations can only work if those nations consider the union as more fundamental than policy . 
   until europeans recognise that differing opinions about the direction and laws of the eu are valid , there can be no united europe . 
  an attitude of `` agree with us on policy or leave the union '' is fundamentally incompatible with a union . 
  this attitude prevents further european integration far more than any opposition to particular policies . 
  imagine if a us state seceded every time it disagreed with the federal government . 
  the usa would have lasted decades at best . 
   the rhetoric that britain is `` holding back '' the eu is a clever strategy , but falls down under analysis . 
  the uk does plenty to try to develop the eu -- lord hill 's attempts at creating a european capital markets ' union for example . 
  what `` britain holding back the eu '' means in reality is `` britain does n't agree with our specific policies '' . 
  the rhetoric presumes that there is some natural state for the eu to be in -- which is generally the french establishment 's idea of what the eu should be -- and that britain is blocking this natural development . 
  this is not the case . 
  there is no natural destination for the eu , just the destination that europe carves for itself by democratic process which involves all of europe . 
  the eu has to learn to tolerate fundamental disagreements between its constituent parts if it ever wants to be a real union . 
   remarks like this also rather misrepresent the level of euroscepticism within france and other parts of continental europe . 
  let us not forget that it was a french referendum that killed the proposed eu constitution . 
  democracy in action !, 
  were they kurds ? 
  possibly ... but then you 'll have to fight the other celtic areas for the title . 
  edit :  historically , it was widely observed throughout ireland , scotland and the isle of man . 
  similar festivals are held at the same time of year in other celtic lands ; for example the brythonic calan gaeaf ( in wales ) , kalan gwav ( in cornwall ) , and kalan goa\u00f1v ( in brittany ) . 
  indeed . 
  though the more i read about 20th century political shenanigans between the two , the more it paints a picture of the two nations trying to scupper each other 's plans at every turn . 
  i was raised a good protestant boy by my protestant mother and catholic father ( lol ) . 
  i attend church with my mother a few times a year , same with wifey 's parents ( they are methodists ) . 
  my personal view is agnosticism . 
  they stole parts of the west riding in 1974 for admin purposes , one day we will bring them back home . 
  [ west riding of yorkshire ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/west_riding_flag.png ) , quite a new one for an ancient area . 
   the flag was registered by the flag institute on 23 may 2013 as the winning entry in a competition organised in conjunction with it.the flag features a `` rose-en-soleil '' device first used by edward iv upon his accession to the throne , combining the white rose of the house of york with the sun emblem used by his royal predecessor , richard ii . 
  in essence the rose-en-soleil is a more elaborate version of the white rose emblem associated with the county and had been used by the former west riding council in its coat of arms . 
  the rose emblem is placed against an offset red cross in scandinavian style , reflecting the anglo-scandinavian history of the region during the era when the ridings were first established . 
  the cross may be seen therefore as a nordic cross in english colours , a graphic encapsulation of local heritage and history .
