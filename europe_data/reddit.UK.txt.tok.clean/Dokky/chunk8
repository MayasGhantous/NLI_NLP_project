  if the appeal fails and it is put to the vote , i 'm heading down to the public gallery of the commons to witness history , either way . 
   heathrow is going to lose a lot of its connections with continental eu after brexit eh ?

  do n't take the past so ... personally . 
  those in the know use theatre surplus anyway , 
   the wreck of a german u-boat that sank almost 100 years ago has been discovered by engineers laying subsea power cables . 
  remarkable sonar images show the missing world war one submarine is largely intact and lying off the galloway coast . 
   experts believe the vessel could be the ub-85 , a sub sunk by hms coreopsis in 1918 , according to official records . 
  however , naval folklore suggests it may have been attacked by a `` sea monster '' . 
  also there have been two [ hms shakespeare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_shakespeare ) . 
  humanity has been demolishing/supplanting structures for millennia as attitudes and ideologies change . 
  your local church replacing a pagan ritual site , stone circles being destroyed , bamiyan buddhas being blown up by the taliban , razing of palmyra , etc. 
  drinking , suicide and shooting russians ? 
  not sure in which order . 
  [ aye , the world could have been very different .

  to annoy france i think . 
  firstly , you assume only british users downvoted . 
  secondly , you use words like douchebag . 
  salad ? 
  interesting , many thanks . 
   they rely on eu freedom of movement in what respect you they rely on it ? 
   celtic tradition sorry , this is civic nationalism , not primordial ethnic nationalism . 
   a lot of businesses and talent would move north to stay in the eu can you qualify this please ? 
   i think , fundamentally , scotland is too different to the rest of the uk . 
  we 're further to the left politically , we have different views regarding immigration and refugees , and we have different priorities when it comes to spending ( e.g. 
  more on renewable energy , less on defence ) . 
  ah , this old chestnut . 
  no ethnic nationalism please , just civic . 
  you 're doing your troll account wrong . 
  i fully understand , successor states always try and use some excuse - like turkey blaming the armenian genocide on the ottomans yet accepting the more prestigious elements of their ottoman inheritance . 
  i think it was the ussr . 
  can i plug you into the hyperdrive ? 
  okay salazar . 
  mmm , cap pushes prices up for eu products . 
  you mean an eu passport ? 
  and inflation has n't matched 15 % ... though we need an even lower pound and higher inflation for some stability in the long term . 
  oh , did n't realise inflation had skyrocketed in the last month . 
  now , must get back to beating up romanian immigrants whilst reading the sun . 
  what ? 
  tourists spending # 2.5 billion ... yes . 
  `` give me liberty , or give me death ! '', 
  brexit is a great smokescreen , let them fiddle whilst ( the treaty of ) rome burns . 
  yes , it is that simple . 
  i was n't soley referring to the eu , european politcal systems in general . 
   it 's not like we do n't have similarly bad corruption issues on a national level . 
  well , yes . 
  but two wrongs do n't make a right !, 
  the system breeds corruption , not sure why so many blindly defend it . 
  should have stopped at a trading bloc , without a common currency . 
  best devalue the pound to stimulate foreign investment . 
  i love europe , i just despise the eu , 
   there 's plenty of racism and biggotry in your country a drop in the ocean compared to france , get your own house in order perhaps ? 
  you are coming across as the stereotypical anti-anglosphere bigot . 
  so , should i judge france on the basis of reports i see about fn ? 
  or indeed europe based on the rants of the lunatic fringe posting here ? 
  you are very salty , and most of your posts on your brand new alt account are basically moaning about the usa , uk and defending france at every turn ( beautiful blind patriotism ) . 
  if the real world upsets you so much , might i suggest blissful ignorance as a remedy . 
  do n't tar us all with the same brush , it is that simple . 
  visas for holidays ? 
  one visa for the eu ? 
  even so , hardly the end of the world ... 
   an englishman is just the last person who should talk about the spirit of europe . 
  that is a sweeping statement , do n't you think ? 
  stereotyping millions of people based on the actions of a tiny proportion of bigots ? 
  hmm ? 
  i 'll repeat my stance : love europe , loath the eu , 
  you must be new to this . 
  i was pointing out your hypocrisy , not sure why i bothered with a 3 day old troll account but hey ho . 
  also your sarcasm radar must not be working , i 'll arrange for a fresh one to be shipped over to sangatte . 
   lack of investment from london-centric government public spending is 16 % higher in scotland than the average for the uk . 
   as a french i do n't care about the brexit . 
   an englishman is just the last person who should talk about the spirit of europe . 
   nope , i for one do n't really like estonians , at least those i met . 
  cold people with kind of a i know better than you attitude , even tho most of them discovered life in 1991 . 
   go back to school kid , i 'm not here to educate you . 
   all those racism , xenophobia and biggotry that your country showed the rest of europe about europeans is indeed blowing up in your face . 
   damn i did n't expect that from scots . 
  i could n't care less about england , but scotland is a nice , i hope it wo n't end up being a biggots land too . 
  we are the bastard sons and daughters of europe . 
  i 'm a leave voter and i see it . 
  then again i 'm not a rampant racist , homophobe , particularly old or want to resurrect the empire ( even went to university ! ) . 
  i just do n't want political integration with the eu - no issue with regulated and fair economic cooperation . 
  love europe , loath the eu . 
  we have not changed , you just forgot , 
  is the croissant not austrian ? 
  probably just lost in translation, 
   less important countries, 
  perhaps it is a numbers game ?
