  scotland has the population/gdp of yorkshire after all . 
  both sides are equally capable of any type of nationalism , just that each is permanently associated with one brand . 
  in a negative light on this forum , most certainly yes . 
  all scottish nationalism is nuanced , progressive and good , all english nationalism is right wing , regressive and bad . 
  that is the hilarious argument . 
  are you smoking crack ? 
   the eu will be able to integrate and become more democratic lol, 
  is money real or an abstract concept invented to enslave the masses ?

  fiesta , carnival and a passion for life ? 
  dictatorships and revolutions ? 
  salsa and flamenco ? 
  a laid-back lifestyle ? 
  but then :  we hope you already have more than this stereotypical view of the spanish - and portuguese - speaking worlds . 
  if you want to really deepen your understanding of the languages , cultures , society and history of these areas , then spanish , portuguese and latin american studies at the university of leeds is the place for you . 
  might as well claim belize back as british honduras then , 35 years of independence is long enough . 
  yes it is , great with jam and cream as my grandmother used to make .

  it has roughly the same population as the county in england i reside in ( yorkshire ) . 
  we have [ mosquitoes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culex_pipiens ) and midges .

  my friend has lived in armley for years , rough place indeed . 
  have had trouble from yoofs and pond life walking the short distance from the bus stop to his house several times . 
  this sums up the area for me :  bordering the city centre is armley . 
  if proof be needed that evolution has n't entirely occured , pay a visit . 
  all kinds of sub-creatures wandering about armley town street , smacked up grannies and delinquent teenagers . 
  home of hmp armley , where most of it 's residents aspire to be . 
   i 'm glad i left your shitty country as are we . 
  i meant divisive , apologies . 
  plenty of left wing types voted brexit . 
  this is how ~ ~ decisive ~ ~ divisive a vote it was , political leanings and social background are not huge factors . 
  age was , make of that what you will ( older generation were more likely to vote leave ) .

  there are several polish shops/cafes/etc in my local area , none which have been firebombed , robbed , etc.

  do n't be so melodramatic . 
  scotland does n't, 
  i see, 
  brexit is a symptom of eu failure , not the cause . 
  just goes to show , money is n't everything, 
  so many conservatives ( defenders of the status quo ) can not see the golden opportunity of political reform we now have . 
  we need to work together , but at the moment it feels like ideological death squads are roaming the digital world looking for ` leave ' voters to lynch . 
  their ignorance and snobbery has sadly been exposed , ` the poor/old are idiots/racists/xenophobes / retards , should n't have the vote ' etc etc.
