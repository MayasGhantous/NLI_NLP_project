it 's on the same level of english at the welsh national level . 
  it is also a co-official language of the eu , like scots gaelic , and has been used to address the commission before now . 
  however , i would n't expect it on a sign like this . 
  he needs to stop embarrassing himself , but that would likely be a hard habit to beat . 
  i mean , calling out the welsh first minister ( he supports no , to clarify ) for not wanting to campaign against independence due to westminster 's inability to adhere to the silk commission 's findings after they said they would , and then pushing it halfheartedly through ( still uhming and ahing about it ) just so that he would campaign against scottish independence . 
  i 'm not sure i can get across how ridiculous that situation is , and there are too many like it . 
  ( sorry for being ranty ), 
  good to know it is n't completely packed !, 
  getting off or on there when it is has been a bit hairy to say the least . 
  would be interesting coming off the subway to seeing a larger than usual crowd . 
  are the buchanan and st enoch stations closed for proceedings ? 
  sometimes they think it 's being snobby , others ( usually related to the first ) think/say `` everyone speaks english just speak that '' or `` stop being exclusionary speak english '' . 
  i hate to come across xenophobic , but usually it 's the english migrants that cause this issue . 
  not all , it honestly depends on the community . 
  i 'm lucky in regards to where i hail from with this ; if they were unwilling to at least be tolerant they 'd have a hard time integrating ( has happened in the past , they leave after their romantic view of `` rural '' living is shattered ) . 
  i work in welsh as much as i can !, 
  even get a scholarship for it , but simple things like going to the shop or talking with friends ( english students mostly in my department ) are things i usually ca n't do in welsh . 
  agreed on the linguistic diversity , it 's a bit dull . 
  it 's nice seeing people take the initiative though and learning welsh when they are from other countries . 
  i know of an american , italian and a manx person at the very least learning it , which makes my nationalism tingle , hah . 
  welsh mothertongue , english second language . 
  english has taken over unfortunately due to it 's prevalence on devices and the internet . 
  there are few places i can speak welsh without offending someone that ca n't , too . 
  i really do n't understand the rhetoric from the uk regarding a `` strong recovery '' . 
  it 's imbalanced at best , a journey from bangor to glasgow by car will show this . 
  the water supply in wales is n't in state hands , it 's run by a not-for-profit . 
  it 's interesting as it was bought from western power distribution ( american company ) by glas cymru ( private bonds business set up just for running dwr cymru ) in 2001 . 
  it 's possibly the only way i 'm comfortable with it being privatised . 
  the water is safe to drink and on the whole affordable'at # 1.3 per cubic metre , average annual bills are about # 440 . 
  i 've only recently been billed for my water supply though , been isolated from it growing up with our own water supply . 
  `` hiraeth '' ( welsh ) , is described in english as that but it 's not ... quite perfect in representation . 
  if i understood correctly , is that sort of what `` morri\u00f1a '' is like when you try to describe it in another language ? 
  i was n't expecting it , and it completely threw me off . 
  i 'm not sure such things should be allowed on the ballot , especially if it means people are deciding after receiving their paper . 
  agreed about jill ; she 's always been lovely when i 've contacted her , and she does her job well . 
  just voted myself , some issues already at the polling station ; people got polling cards and are n't on the register . 
  voted plaid cymru , north wales . 
  i hope they retain their mep , but it depends on the turnout here . 
  got the shock of my life on the ballot paper . 
  i did n't realise `` britain first '' and `` no ^ 2eu '' were actual parties ; the slogan for the former was `` remember lee rigby '' which really did n't help . 
  i kind of want them to use that, 
  yeah , screw them and their `` human rights '' and `` single market '' !, 
  we do n't need none of that money/niceness !, 
  thought i 'd have to ask for a postal ballot , but i got my [ first polling card ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mx20wpw.jpg ) instead . 
  bit excited . 
  nb : i forgot that ukip 's website had a lovely [ splash image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hbni6an.png ) . 
  i really want to laugh , but this is more concerning than anything else . 
  thanks for the information . 
  good gods , my halls are luxury in comparison . 
  i knew i had it good due to the lack of asbestos and 90s buildings but wow , talk about disparity between east and western europe . 
  i keep wondering if they realise what kind of a shitstorm that would create . 
  i 'd be far more vocal in welsh affairs and push far harder for independence under the eu . 
  it 's the valleys , it helps put it into context as to how deprived the area is in comparison to even the rest of wales . 
  it 's a very interesting map , and knowing the areas it helps explain a lot of the socioeconomic issues in those areas . 
  even more interesting is where there is no economic activity around my area , there is a high uptake of higher education , yet many centres of economic activity have a huge dip in uptake . 
  i ca n't help but feel this is hilarious . 
  first [ a russian political scientist ] ( http://cyplive.com/eng/news/v-sluchae-napadeniya-na-siriyu-nado-vvesti-voyska-v-pribaltiku.html ) says they need to invade the baltic nations to show their power over the syrian situation , then this . 
  russia is going to russia , i suppose . 
  i 've not seen violent nationalism , but it did exist . 
  there were small groups like y gweriniaethwyr which were republicans and blew up things like water pipelines in the 50s . 
  then , due to tryweryn , mudiad amddiffyn cymru was set up and blew up national grid equipment and pipelines to liverpool . 
  government buildings were also attacked with bombs . 
  the fwa was also set up around this time , and was rumoured to have been sold arms by the oira . 
  when tried , members refused to speak english . 
  meibion glynd\u0175r firebombed a * lot * of english holiday homes and attempted to letterbomb and firebomb a fair few tory politicians . 
  outside of their specific activities , the defacing of english holiday homes was popular and still does happen albeit not as often . 
  i probably should n't call myself a nationalist otherwise people think i want to bomb people . 
  plaid 's decentralised hence the mixed messages . 
  their party stance is anti-nuclear but the local guy is for wylfa as long as it is beneficial to the local economy . 
  that said , i 'm very glad i do n't have to go through those local elections . 
  the question likely asked whether people regularly , or have regularly watched pornography . 
  i know quite a lot of people who just do n't have interest in sex and so whenever they 've seen it they just do n't want to continue seeing it . 
  i recall the protests being about the protestors being sick of the widespread corruption and hypocrisy of government officials , as well as the poor state of the economy outside of sofia . 
  i 've not spoken to friends from bulgaria about them since they started , and there 's no news here from what i can see about them so that 's likely out of date . 
  ** wales ** * the royal welsh show was a success , with visitor numbers growing for a second year running . 
  * cardiff hospital is classed as ` dangerous ' , patients died while waiting for surgery . 
  inquiry called for by mps . 
  * huge , huge influx of inward investment ( 191 % increase on last year ) with around 4,000 existing jobs safeguarded through this . 
  welsh government itself helped create and safeguard 17,000 jobs this past 12 months . 
  * nuclear power plant discussion is likely to be a key point in upcoming local government elections , with ukip using it as a chance to speak out against the single market . 
  ** mundane ** * bee swarm took over a post box for 20 minutes . 
  * it 's been too hot . 
  * a lady who gave birth is welcomed back . 
  * mockery of david cameron 's bid to get isps to block websites ; a journalist found out about tor and freenet 's unsavoury sides . 
  that 's about all i can remember really . 
  honestly , outside of the uk has been far more interesting . 
  merkel not doing anything on this topic is n't a surprise , or even scary to me . 
  what scares me is that citizens turn a blind eye to it , and the union is so far ineffective at getting answers and solutions to these breaches of trust and privacy . 
  or we 'd probably just sit there grumpily and eye them up as a poor eastern european nation and pull the middle finger to their treaty rights . 
  hopefully not up mountains ... last thing people need is to be tweeting while walking up a mountain . 
  i only really know of how much of a pain in the arse it is in snowdonia , partly because of it being where i live . 
  really annoying seeing people walking around in shorts , t-shirts and sandals/flip-flops without even a bottle of water . 
  i 've not actually heard of much about the beacons lately ; from a few months ago yeah but not lately . 
  likely due to more north news than south . 
  ** wales ** - * a man drowned in a park , circumstances unknown . 
  * a man drowned in a reservoir , circumstances unknown . 
  * people keep falling off mountains or going up unprepared . 
  * a two seater plane crashes after hitting a tree in south wales , no injuries . 
  * technology enhances early learning . 
  wales has been quite boring this past week other than the sweltering temperatures .
