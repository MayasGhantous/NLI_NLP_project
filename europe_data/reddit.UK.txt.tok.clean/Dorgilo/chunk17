  here the graduations from uni have proper events , where you get handed a piece of paper by the chancellor in front of loads of people . 
  not that i can think of , but then if i 'd been to the us i 'd probably know a little more of the culture there so might find something . 
   less slutty look comapred to uk ( there was a yt vblog with polish girl comparing i do n't know that that 's overly common to be honest , certainly most of the girls i 've known do n't dress like that, 
  if you 've got health issues to take care of , see a doctor if you have n't already . 
  if you 're really feeling down though , i 'd definitely see a counsellor . 
  you 'd be surprised how good it is just to have someone to talk to about your issues - i have had mental health support myself , and it has been unbelievably helpful . 
  just to be clear , are you in this situation ? 
  if yes , i 'd suggest seeing a counsellor . 
  if not , then it 's probably advisable to go do something you enjoy , instead of making yourself upset over something completely hypothetical . 
  having less money does n't necessarily lead to any of that . 
  as long as you 've got enough to live , money is n't everything . 
  so you 'd pick a lifetime of suffering leading to a likely early and painful death , over a maximum of 18 years of having less money . 
  to say that surprises me would be a horrible understatement . 
  cancer is worse . 
  how is this even a question ? 
  who would pick child support ? 
  really ? 
  i thought it was pretty much universal here ? 
  i know people from all over the country and they all say it ... 
  i 'd like to add shelley ( frankenstein ), 
  we say the same here, 
  not sure about that , i think most people would consider them british . 
  obviously there will be a few who do n't , but people like that exist in every country . 
  there is a lot of american tv viewed here , but then we have a lot of our own shows too - both are capable of drawing in large audiences . 
  i do n't think anyone judges filmmakers based on nationality - for example , steven spielberg is well-respected , but michael bay ? 
  probably less . 
  to be honest the only combat sport i 've ever been into is robot wars , 
   genetically all humans are super similar and people from different places are being mixed since forever . 
  true . 
  if genetics were important , then i 'd be 50 % banana , and proud of it :p, 
   it 's just melanin . 
  any chance of that on a mug/t-shirt or somehting ? 
  i love that . 
  i could never really get into any american sports - not a fan of baseball ( although it 's the one i 'm probably most likely to like , if i watched a game ) , way too many stoppages in nfl , the scoring 's too regular in basketball . 
  watched the odd nascar race but found it a little boring . 
  not sure about indycar as i 've never seen it . 
  hong kong , right ? 
  forgive my ignorance but i was less than 3 years old at the time , so not fully aware of world politics  not surprised about cyprus , my uni has a campus there though so i wonder how it 'll affect them ( having said that , it is technically in the dmz so it 's not exactly unusual for my uni to have to deal with geographical issues ) . 
  is there anything going on with gibraltar ? 
  i heard there 's elements of the spanish government that are n't happy with it belonging to us . 
  plus the falklands if we include overseas territories , although thankfully the current argentinean government seems more cooperative on that one than the previous government . 
  for me that 's a really difficult question , i am into a great variety of music depending on what mood i 'm in . 
  probably something by elbow though , as they 're my favourite band ; possibly something from their album ` the takeoff and landing of everything ' , as that 's my favourite album of theirs , or ` leaders of the free world ' , one of their older albums . 
  so , from ` the takeoff and landing of everything ' : * [ new york morning ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnibuem5fe ) * [ my sad captains ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9laveeuwrii ) * [ the takeoff and landing of everything ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kblzkziluta ) * [ the blanket of night ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiad8u6nu2i ) , a song about refugees from ` leaders of the free world ' : * [ station approach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wosszwnkrva ) * [ forget myself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2k5eflpb3a ) * [ leaders of the free world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulhggkgzgzi ) the actual video 's a shortened version , so this is the album version * [ great expectations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um95ikmeh6i ) , a beautiful song and quoted as guy garvey 's ( the lead singer ) favourite to be honest i could list most of elbow 's songs , for one reason or another . 
  i have all 6 ` proper ' albums they have done so far ( this excludes ` dead in the boot ' , a b-sides album , and ` courting the squall ' , guy 's solo album ) and their new album ` little fictions ' , is due to be released today - so no doubt i will be picking that up at some point . 
  i prefer ` leaders of the free world ' ( their third album ) onwards , but there 's still a few songs from the first couple of albums that are well worth a listen . 
  additionally elbow 's music can take a few listens to really ` get ' , and it 's very lyrics-based in terms of where the strength of the songs are ( as in the music 's great , but the lyrics are wonderful ) . 
  guy garvey also has a show on bbc radio 6 i believe , and the band performed at the olympics . 
  despite this , and their music being played on a number of well-known british tv programmes including children in need , they do n't appear to be that well-known anywhere else , particularly the us - which i think is how guy likes it - he moved to new york in part because he would n't be recognised . 
  p.s forgot [ mirrorball ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uhmnalqys4 ) and [ the night will always win ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjxrigdftqe ) , both gorgeous songs . 
  incidentally the performance i 've linked for the second one was where i first heard this song , not long after i knew about elbow . 
  they 've been my favourite band ever since , and i ca n't believe it 's only been 6 years . 
  no - as others have said there 's areas of cities that can be dodgy at night , but that 's pretty much the same as any city in the world . 
  although i 've no doubt that if we spoke to someone who really believed there were , they still would n't believe us . 
  there seems to be a worrying trend who prefer to believe what they believe , even when shown evidence to the contrary . 
  i 'd say he 's reasonably well-known , he 's the only member whose name i know and he 's featured on a couple of shows ( briefly ) here . 
  a-ha as a band will be more famous though . 
  hakkinen , surely ? 
  :p `` it 's hakkinen , he 's going through the left-hander ! '', 
  of the drivers that i 've seen in f1 , he 's one of my favourites . 
  in terms of living people , first one that came to my mind was zydrunas savickas, 
  what about morten harket ? 
  morten harket, 
   it 's a long-ass slog of an anthem . 
  it is also awesome , so there 's that . 
  ours is great and everything , but yours is so much more upbeat . 
  it 's not even close . 
  as far as i know that would probably end up being an eu thing , but seeing as we 're leaving , it would be up to our government in our case . 
  which bodes well / s, 
  that is an excellent idea . 
   americans voted for a donald and did n't expect to get ducked ? 
  upvote just for that line . 
  i 'd add northampton for shoes ( hence kinky boots ) , luton for hats and leicester i believe had a reasonable industry in hosiery . 
  it 's funny ( in the case of the first 2 ) how much you can learn about places from their football teams . 
  macclesfield used to have silk mills , so the team 's nicknamed ` the silkmen ' . 
  rotherham are the millers , bristol city apparently has ` the cider army ' , burton are the brewers , weavers in norwich used to breed canaries . 
  west ham ( the hammers ) were founded by members of the thames ironworks . 
  a few more can be seen in [ this wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_football_club_nicknames_in_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  my personal favourite ( although nothing to do with industry ) is southport , the sandgrounders . 
  it just sounds awesome to me . 
  absolutely more . 
  if we can start launching people using adapted arianes , instead of updated r7s ( technically they 're called soyuz , but they 're in the r7 family ) , that would be absolutely fantastic , as good as the r7s are  space exploration is absolutely useful . 
  apart from the ultimate long-term goal of ` we ca n't live here forever ' , the spinoffs that have resulted from space travel have saved countless lives , and improved countless more . 
  furthermore , i ca n't imagine seeing a rocket launch does n't inspire at least some children to move into science - i watched tim peake 's launch , and even though i 'm already involved in science as a student , i still found it both incredibly joyous and very inspirational . 
  think about the children at his former school , seeing him there and thinking , ` that could be me one day ' . 
  others , because it 's really , really unlikely that there are n't . 
  no , i would n't , not with the events of the last week . 
  if he has to come , then i 'd implement an idea i saw a few months ago - do n't acknowledge him , do n't give him attention , act like he 's not even here . 
  carry on with everything as if it 's just another day . 
  let him rant on twitter if he wants , but i 'm not giving him the attention he so desperately craves . 
  that being said , given the wall and particularly the ban , i feel that we need to say something . 
  it 's disgraceful and reflects badly on us as well ( seeing as ms may did n't condemn it , from what i 've heard ) . 
  trump needs to know that our government might be fine with it , but we are not . 
  yes , and yes , as far as i know . 
  the ban is one of the most disgraceful things i have seen any country do in my lifetime . 
  how can you ban people who just want a chance to live somewhere where they 're not constantly in danger of death ? 
  how can you ban innocent people from moving to the us ? 
  for example , mo farah , winner of 4 olympic gold medals , husband , father , british citizen , can not currently leave the us because he would n't be allowed back in . 
  why ? 
  because he happens to have been born in somalia and therefore ( according to trump and those who support the ban ) ` might ' be a terrorist .
