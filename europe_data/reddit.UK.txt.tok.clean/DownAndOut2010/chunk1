british isles and irish isles , or uk and ireland . 
  not too dificult . 
  you did n't , it 's true . 
  seems to be a common attitude in this sub though . 
  why is religious politics bad for muslims but ok for the rest of us ? 
  recently learned about the german peasant 's war . 
  yeah , and there are europeans who are muslim . 
  that does n't make them not european . 
  christianity is n't native to europe either . 
  the link is supposed to be a joke which offers absolutely nothing to the discussion , it 's not really a comment on an eu military ( which probably is necessary ) . 
  small baltic country relies more on superpower than 4th richest country on planet - who knew ? 
  which kind of capitalism though ? 
  because no country has gone full free-market mode . 
  christianity spread through conquest and force too . 
  our ancestors did n't all choose to have it become the new state religion . 
  while christianity has been massively important and a unifying principal for europe , i do n't view ` european ' and ` christian ' as synonymous . 
  even if islamic cultures ( in spain and the balkans ) were marginal , i 'd still call them ` european ' , at least partly . 
  that 's some sophisticated analysis right there . 
  if brits sell property to foreigners in the uk , that land is still under the juristiction of the uk . 
  foreign powers do not have the right to militarily carve out enclaves within the uk , syphon off its resources for their own personal use , then bloccade it and starve it of resources . 
  outside of the areas i mentioned ( and fatih , which seems to be more conservative so has more hijabis ) , it seemed like an even mix . 
  girls i saw wearing hijab were often still out with boyfriends , in mixed groups and in areas that serve alcohol though , so i guess there 's different levels of conservatism going on . 
  really ? 
  i saw a lot of hijabis in istanbul ( outside of beyo\u011flu , taksim and cihangir ) . 
  is it different in other parts of the country ? 
  working compromise while continuing to annex land and starve palestine of resources ? 
  i was addressing the comment 's claim that the us has a ` commitment to not allowing dictators to govern unchecked ' , which is obviously false ( not withstanding its enormous contribution in ww2 etc ) . 
  if you can disprove my point go ahead , rather than critiquing how i wrote it . 
  afaik those events are for american ex-pats and their pals . 
  `` those three combined will shake up the face of current global economy . '', 
  - russia today , 2016 . 
  lol . 
  would like a word . 
  i do n't think brits hate the germans . 
  i think refusal to accept the euro at the time was down to a ) attachment to our beloved pound , and b ) people being unconvinced that there was any need for it . 
  savage . 
  i 'm in istanbul right now and having a fabulous time . 
  i vote swords for glorious new capital of federated britiain and ireland . 
  we already dictate trade and quality standards in our own regions , which is what the agreement covers . 
  how can we give it thought if we do n't know what the terms of the agreement are ? 
  imo it 's ridiculous to endorse something with potentially far reaching consequences because it might * possibly * not be terrible . 
  `` the rest is history '' - fukteld , 2016, 
  so what 's your candidate ? 
  it 's the following of the word ` country ' that made it a bit ambiguous . 
  that would be the industrial revolution and human labour . 
  capitalism : everyone that has died of hunger or preventable disease ( because they had no money ) since we started producing a global surplus of food . 
  edit : you guys are salty af . 
   we just do n't want to be part of a political union speak for yourself there , buddy . 
  nope !, 
  it 's 90 % arab , and all the whites are locked in concentration camps patrolled by sharia police . 
  source : r/europe , r/worldnews etc. 
  people are absolutely desperate for any attempt to say europe is in decline . 
  the press here in the uk have been saying it for over a decade despite the eu being # 1 in gdp . 
  that 's incredibly simplistic - there is far from unanimous agreement across the union . 
  also voting to stay in !, 
  ( please god let this die as a topic whatever happens ... ), 
  england 's been a centralised state for over a thousand years - it 's hardly the same . 
  it 's basically the musical version of the room . 
  not obvious enough , it seems . 
  disraeli was jewish ? 
  i know fuck all about my country 's history , apparently . 
   i wonder why britain ignored these atrocities realpolitik ? 
  it 's only a few decades ago that we were partying down with pinochet and suharto , while today we condemn human rights violations by our enemies ( see russia ) and ignore those committed by allies . 
  as long as there 's a ` core ' of countries that want an eu and are willing to pay for it it is n't going anywhwere , uk or no uk . 
  have you heard all the complaints from other eu countries about the eu recently ? 
  we 're not the only ones who have issues . 
  if we focused on working more with countries that have similar aims ( instead of distancing ourselves from euro politics ) maybe we could get somewhere . 
  i think a lot of people make the assumption that there 's consensus of opinion across europe on that issue . 
  there are a few countries that seem like they 'd prefer to be on the fringe . 
  no need for google , just browse r/europe and polandball for a few days and you 'll be pissing off your euro neighbours like a boss . 
  remove paella . 
  ( edit : it 's a joke guys , jesus ), 
  triplebream 's salty reddit rants are * literally * the voice of the entire eu . 
  time to give up and leave guys . 
  if r/europe is anything to go by , we 're far from the only group guilty of ` populist gobbldygook ' . 
  and plenty of surveys ( often cited here ) have shown that brits are often * not * informed as to what the eu is and how it works . 
   people like you you 're assuming a lot there , buddy . 
  i 'm pro-eu and will be voting to remain ( unfortunately for you , i guess ) . 
  yep !, 
  all the eu 's problems will be magically solved after brexit , and no other country is the least bit eurosceptic . 
  indifference and ignorance . 
  our governments have done a pretty shit job spreading awareness as to what the eu actually is and why we should care about it . 
  do you ** want ** to get defenestrated ? 
  they do that . 
  all the czechs i know in the uk either say czechia or czech . 
  romance languages call you the same thing iirc . 
  people should be considering this since it 's one of the main arguments of the ` leave ' campaign . 
  not allowing the uk equal privileges as a non-member is behaving like russia ? 
  to an extent i agree with you , however : capitalism does n't necessarily mean progress for gay rights . 
  the uk and us have only changed attitudes fairly recently ( after the better part of a century of activism ) . 
  and in the case of russia i do n't think you can attribute the problem entirely to communism when its government has been actively stoking hatred towards gays for the past decade . 
   you think spain is much better ? 
  spain was recently ranked [ 1st in the world ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/the-country-thats-most-accepting-of-homosexuality-spain/276547/ ) for acceptance of homosexuality . 
  you might want to try again there . 
   uk will the eu probably leave yoda , is that you ? 
  hush , britannia minor . 
  there are hoards of literally ** dozens ** of people moving to hungary !, 
  gypsy selfie game 10/10 . 
   for european and asian countries i use ethnicity as an indicator of ` diversity ' right ... except for here :  germany is 92 % european . 
  such incredibly diversity at work here .
