  he 's anti-nuke , not ` unilateral-disarmament ' , and so far i 've only heard him mention renationalising the rails ( which i think most people would support ) . 
   / r/unitedkingdom is essentially / r/corbynislife . 
  lol is it fuck , unless you think anything less than rabidly anti-corbyn equals unwavering support . 
  literally every thread in that sub that is in any way relevant to corbyn results in mass bickering about the man . 
  they can campaign for another 20 years for an efta referendum , i guess ,, 
  sure !, 
  if there 's one thing we 're known for , it 's never betraying our friends . 
  you can totally trust us . 
   ( fun fact - lincoln ( the city closest to my hometown ) contains two of the [ oldest extant houses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jews%27_court,_lincoln ) in england , that are associated with the city 's jewish community before their expulsion in 1290 . 
  it 's thought the houses used to be the site of a synagogue , and in 1992 lincoln 's renewed jewish population [ started using the venue ] ( http://jscn.org.uk/small-communities/lincolnshire-jewish-community/ ) for shabbat again , which makes me feel a bit less shit about the sad history of the city . ), 
  something we have in common !, 
  wan na join our union ? 
  apparently some people believe ahmadiyya islam was a british/zionist conspiracy intended to tame islam and increase control over muslim lands . 
  ( a [ cursory google search ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ahmaddiyya+british+plot&amp;oq=ahmaddiyya+british+plot&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6452j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8#q=ahmadiyya+british+conspiracy ) yields a fair amount of crazy on the subject . ), 
  the ioc itself ranks by golds . 
  are they wrong though ? 
  if there 's only so much investment going round , and most of that is going into cricket it 's going to impact on other sports . 
  thank you for the tip !, 
  i 'll check this out . 
  the visa agency that now handles applications [ ( vfs ) ] ( http://ru.vfsglobal.co.uk/ ) slaps an extra # 40 onto the fee . 
  yeah . 
  # 100 for a visa ? 
  i 'd love to visit russia , but it 's going to have to be a long trip to justify that to my cheap-arse broke self . 
   krak\u00f3w turning into a mega tourist magnet would suck is n't it already , kind of ? 
  it 's already got a reputation as a party destination now for my fellow brits . 
  i should hopefully get to poland again next year , but i 'll probably hit poznan , torun , gdansk or warsaw instead . 
   history is history , but to approve of the empire , or to try to promote its `` benefits '' to people in countries plundered by the british of history . 
  honestly for the most part i just do n't think we get taught enough about it . 
  i 'm probably in the small minority of brits who know something about the bengal famine , and i had to discover that myself . 
  i do n't think we should personally have to feel guilty or apologise for what happened in the past , but i do wish people had more awareness of how our country shaped the present . 
  jason kenny just won gold in the men 's sprint - we 're back to 2nd . 
   the architecture is nothing to write home about , and beautiful areas are placed right next to run down commieblocks and everything looks like it 's in decay . 
  there 's not the cohesion of paris or charm of amsterdam . 
  thank the blitz for the lack of london 's architectural cohesion !, 
  a huge portion of the city [ was destroyed ] ( http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/intricately-colorcoded-maps-marking-bomb-damage-from-the-london-blitz ) ( something like a million houses ) . 
  [ bye bye barcelona ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdxcfchrpmi ) ? 
  and behind that facade you get [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=beyoglu&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjqvunc3mhoahwcisakhcm3cf4q_auicsgc&amp;biw=1134&amp;bih=613 ) . 
  i love beyoglu ( the area in your photo ) . 
  i personally do n't agree about paris . 
  i think it 's big enough and there 's enough going on for it not be defined by tourism - once you duck outside the 1st arrondisement and the other hotspots ( the tower , montmartre , part of the left bank ) , it 's completely different . 
  you guys have plenty of wealth-hoarding dynasties , no ? 
  they just do n't have titles . 
  yes , because other western euro countries have acted so forcefully in comparison ? 
  recently even germany has been considering easing sanctions , yet for some reason you 're salty as fuck about the uk in particular . 
  i 'm not wasting any more time on this , enjoy your outrage . 
  meanwhile we 're one of the few countries to actually send troops to eastern europe . 
  god you sound bitter . 
  of course we 'll never ditch the us consensus , but i guess it does n't stop us from bluffing . 
  well done to them for finally learning the difference between pisa and [ pizza ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/italians-are-ridiculing-an-isis-supporter-for-planning-an-attack-on-the-leaning-tower-of-pizza-10062278.html ) i guess ? 
  we take all the skill we do n't use in football and spend it on the olympics instead . 
  so brazil is guaranteed to get 3rd place !, 
  right ... ? 
   they do n't care whether it 's dirty money or not , just if they can get their hands on it , in return for whatever is wanted in return . 
  which is why i was convinced brexit would never happen ( this country 's always run on pragmatism ) . 
  now who knows wtf is going on ? 
  the divide there is more about geopolitical rivalry than sectarianism , no ? 
  i swear almost everything i read online about the balkans that has a comment section gets bombarded with outrage . 
  you know it 's bad when you have to rely on a foreign government to maintain the standards of your media . 
  this is why it should have been decided by supramajority . 
  most of the people who voted want to leave * . 
  there are several examples of countries in europe ( and around the world ) today that formed a new national identity by combining different ethnic and linguistic groups . 
  where do you think the ` french ' and ` spanish ' identities came from ? 
   these unions have the habit of creating these fake nationalities out of thin air . 
  no shit , that 's how countries are formed . 
  all nationalities are ` fake ' because they 're artificial constructs created by men ( after fate and warfare determine where imaginary lines should be drawn on maps ) , they do n't spring fully formed from the ground . 
  if the ussr still existed and people identified as ` soviet ' , who are you to tell them that identity is ` fake ' ? 
  is the american identity fake because it was constructed from scratch ? 
   british is a collective term for 4 nations , not a separate nation in itself . 
  the uk is a nation of nations . 
  until recently , most people identified as british ** and ** scottish , english etc * . 
  whether you approve or not is irrelevant . 
   one of these 4 nations is the irish one , and it 's currently divided due to english imperialism , british * imperialism , since the english are n't the only ones who fucked up ireland during the last 400 years . 
  * [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24302914 ) are the figures from 2013 . 
  that applies to every nuclear power , and since no nuclear power has ever been invaded in a conventional war the threat seems to be working . 
  unless you 're suggesting the uk would n't use it 's deterrent in the case of invasion . 
  ` dont like it too bad ' - well that has been the official line for several decades . 
  yes , because if there 's one thing people never do , it 's criticise china , saudi arabia , iran and turkey . 
  til having nuclear weapons = ` defenseless ' . 
  and they said the uk had nothing to export !, 
  uk-russian relations are n't bad just because of the eu . 
  we 're firmly in the us camp - as soon as there 's another military conflict somewhere it 'll be back to bashing each other on bbc and rt as usual . 
  just read * the master and margarita * - holy crap what a good book . 
   libertarianism - a concept missing from modern europe thank fuck . 
  mate , are you obsessed with ted heath ? 
  i 'm sure i remember your eurosceptic posts once containing non-ted heath based material , now you 're making the same comments in like every eu related thread . 
  is everything ok ? 
  a lot of tory members , mps and voters are pro-leave . 
  i think circumstances will need to change ( or to appear to have changed ) before may would risk a rebellion and electoral chances by scuppering brexit . 
  at this stage my money 's on them stalling until they feel the moment 's as good as it 's going to be and then trying for an eea-ish deal . 
  yeah , when i was at school the only options were french and german . 
  maybe it 's changed since then . 
  in the case of the uk i think it 's also because we 're dominated by other anglo media but do n't get the linguistic benefit of that exposure , and we do n't really get exposed to other languages ( not on the same level anyway ) . 
  there also seems to be a pervasive belief that we 'll automatically be shit at other languages anyway , so why try ( especially since everyone seems to speak english so well ) ? 
  the prospect of this dragging on for years is extremely depressing . 
  it also gives salty remainers like myself naive hope that it wo n't actually happen . 
   who is that guy in `` 2 . '',
