  because demagogues campaigned for 40 years to persuade people every one of their problems was because of the eu ? 
  as opppsed to every submission title that spells doom for the uk getting massively upvoted ? 
  by sucking up to other economies who will of course bend over to give us favourable trade deals and will totally not screw us in negotiations . 
  hitting up western ukraine and romania next year !, 
  ~ ~ because who does n't want more drunken brits in their country ? ~ ~, 
  one of us ... !, 
  the point is that making guns freely available will exacerbate the problem . 
  i do n't see why that 's controversial ? 
  the fact that ** some ** guns are available does not mean our gun laws should be abandoned . 
  except our gun laws make getting a gun difficult , while anyone can buy a knife . 
  the potential impact of a knife and a gun is different . 
  hence why ` only ' one person is dead . 
  iirc candidate countries still get some benefits , in which case being an eternal candidate that never joins might still be useful . 
  cyprus is n't technically in europe though , and i do n't think an independent greenland or georgia joining ( if they ever wanted to ) is that crazy a prospect . 
  / the leave campaign . 
  also plovdiv has something many other towns do n't have : a shopping mall in a roman amphitheatre . 
  at the risk of sounding like a dick , the scots are british * ( just so foreigners do n't get even more confused by the terminology ) . 
  * by definition of coming from the island , even if individuals from scotland do n't identify much with ` britishness ' nowadays ( and nor do the english and welsh for that matter ) . 
  we 're leaving the eu , not the us/nato block that covers most of europe and is aligned against russia . 
  do n't mix them up . 
  if we end up in the eea we 'll still be part of glorious euro empire anyway . 
  the us is simultaneously behind everything bad that happens ever and so incompetent they ca n't capture erdogan/shoot his plane down . 
  the current situation is based on the outcome of the referendum and the uk 's limbo though . 
  the effects could be much more severe following article 50 . 
  ireland has the language ( especially in the west ) , it 's just not as strong as it could be . 
  the [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/irish/articles/view/625/english/ ) have basic courses in irish , scots gaelic and welsh . 
  i 'm not able to say if the course is great but you could use it along with duolingo and google grammar reference websites ? 
  he was downvoted because cornish is being revived in cornwall . 
  in north wales it 's common to hear people using it rather than english . 
   never took its medicine after 2008 can you clarify what you mean by this ? 
  ( i 'm guessing cuts . ), 
  the white english population is n't declining though ( compared to historic numbers ) , therefore there is no ` eradication ' . 
  we have n't been kicked off the island ( i.e replaced ) , we just now share it with non-native white brits . 
  whether you think there should be parallel communities is another question , but saying there has been replacement ( as opposed to addition ) is disingenuous . 
  ( edited for clarification . ), 
  fatih erdogan can take that up with the us . 
  i 'm sure he 'll have every success . 
  english identity has n't been replaced though , it just exists next to british cosmopolitanism ( or whatever you want to call it ) . 
  white people are n't rushing out to wear saris , celebrate eid or speak urdu . 
  edit : thanks for the downvotes !, 
  spain is just a rumour the gulenists made up to distract people from their coup attempt . 
  seems like you should be worrying about your country mate rather than mine . 
  i 'm touched you 're so concerned though . 
  a ) nations do n't have to join nato . 
  b ) if you want to take that from my message go nuts . 
  i said euro - not eu . 
  and the uk is still in the eu for at least the next two years ( and may end up in the eea meaning we 'd still take part in sanctions ) . 
  turkey will very much care if a bunch of euro sanctions come its way . 
  lucky for you we 're used to working with dictatorships  and will do nothing while you continue to keep migrants out of our glorious ~ ~ utopia ~ ~ continent . 
  hey , i was n't complaining . 
  it 's just part of the deal ( which most nato governments think is worth it ) . 
  am from this region - can confirm would 10/10 recommend . 
  the us has bases in many nato countries . 
  get used to it . 
  as long as erdogan does what he 's told re global strategy etc i doubt our governments care that much tbh . 
  yeah . 
  i do n't support leave , but i know very few people who do who actively want the eu destroyed . 
  they just think it 's a thing for dirty continentals that they do n't want to participate in . 
  they joined the uk for eu membership ? 
  it would sell for less than it cost anyway - the taxpayer 's already been shafted ( never mind the added cost of having two parliaments ) . 
  / u/executivemonkey 's trolling is n't that low effort . 
  i 'd think twice before licking his arse , since a ) he 's full of shit , and b ) his country is partly responsible for this crisis . 
  lol . 
  yeah , and later in history spain was occupied by france anyway . 
  is france likely to occupy an independent catalonia ? 
  we also have former ` regions ' in europe that are now countries and they 're doing fine . 
  again , what you 're saying is completely arbitrary . 
  after it was conquered , wales was just a ` region ' of england until its status as a country was reaffirmed in the 20th century . 
  catalonia was a separate political entity before it joined with aragon and then became part of spain . 
  many european countries have ` regions ' that used to be partly or completely independent with their own cultures and languages . 
  what you 're saying is completely arbitrary . 
  maybe there will be no need for ` large states ' under an increasingly integrated eu umbrella ? 
  if there are people in scotland and wales who want independence after 300 and 700 years , respectively , i ca n't see why it 's unfathomable for the same to happen in other euro countries with strong ` regional ' identities . 
  nothing lasts forever . 
  yeah . 
  this historic ` protest against austerity ' , then back to business as usual voting tory at the next ge . 
  is the guardian the sole authority on european politics now ? 
  all of them , apparently . 
   european countries are getting fed up of liberal-lefties . 
  exactly !, 
  literally ** every ** euro country is dominated by liberal lefties . 
  centre/right politics have absolutely no voice in europe , and no one ever votes tory , partido popular , union pour un mouvement populaire , christlich demokratische union deutschlands , fidesz , law and justice etc. 
  the uk 's been one of the most stable euro countries historically , despite the lack of a written constitution . 
  it 's just our turn for a crazy period is all . 
  some break away countries here , a few riots there , recession and an authoritarian government ... standard fare . 
  the uk is ` developed ' and there 's a lot of vandalism here . 
  want to explain where you think the left is the ` establishment ' ? 
  damn . 
  right guys , time for another referendum ... 
  only ** good ** commonwealth migration , mind . 
  only the rich , white , non-islamic english-speaking countries ... and maybe singapore . 
  the anglo media have been wishing decline on europe for a century . 
  it 's the dankest of memes . 
  presumably while continuing to pocket his fat salary from the eu parliament . 
  what does that have to do with eu freedom of movement being ` unfair ' ? 
  do we have the right to permanently settle in non-eu countries ? 
  we can move to eu countries , they can move here = fair . 
  savage . 
  / u/paulusmagintie is confusing terms . 
  your ` college ' and british unis are the same thing .
