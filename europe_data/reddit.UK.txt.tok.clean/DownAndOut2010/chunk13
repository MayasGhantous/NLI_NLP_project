  what we call ` college ' in the uk usually means further education ( think sats and vocational courses ) rather than ba programmes . 
  further ed colleges in the uk are mostly free , tertiary ed is not . 
  pretty sure eu students have to be charged home fees in other eu countries , so that would mean free tuition in scotland and 9k in the rest of the uk * . 
  fees for non-eu/eea students depend on the uni ( at mine i think it 's about # 12,000 ) . 
  * unis are promising business as usual until brexit is finalised . 
  edit : international fees for my programme have gone up to # 16,700 . 
  holy shit . 
  is the us behind the ready-made , conveniently advantageous to erdogan list of 50,000 people to purge , too ? 
  was it ridiculed by leave ? 
  i 've heard ` we could get a norway-type deal ! ', 
  argued many times over the last decade ( presumably though they meant ` norway deal ' without freedom of movement , which will never happen ) . 
  not exactly . 
  i 'm still completing my undergrad in the uk . 
  if article 50 and brexit happens in the next couple of years , i 'll have missed the residency window . 
  except xenophobes in the uk wo n't refer to rich brown people as ` ex-pats ' . 
  my , you 're salty . 
  we 'll be driving your property market up and complaining about our kids having to learn irish in no time !, 
  ( i have actually met brit immigrants in ireland complaining about irish ... ), 
  ** we are very important , gib treaties that benefit us and not you **, 
  i 'll be starting with 50k debt in student loans . 
  in the few years since i started uni the gov has already increased the debt for new students ( scrapping maintenance grants so students will borrow # 16,000 a year ) . 
  yeah but germans are able to move to 30 countries through the eu/eea so potential numbers are spread out . 
   we 're not gon na play `` genocide olympics '' i do n't think we have to . 
  i think you can say the terror was an appalling event while considering it with some nuance . 
  so were nagasaki , hiroshima and dresden justified ? 
  ` moral ' revolutions are probably few and far between . 
  selected through eurovision . 
  queen elizabeth descends from the o'neills through the stuarts ?

  she still had to join though did n't she ? 
  this ` special deal ' is not going to happen . 
  if it does it 'll incentivise more exit movements and risks destabilising the union . 
  our money is n't worth it ( just like the eu 's money apparently was n't worth it for leave voters ) . 
  eea application is n't solely her choice , fortunately . 
  it 'll have to go through parliament . 
  if there 's one thing we can trust the leave campaign on it 's facts . 
  fuck that guy . 
  the only upside to his ( disgraceful ) appointment to government is we 'll get to see him humiliated time and time again . 
  theresa may already stated she wo n't promise eu citizens can stay . 
  do you have any idea what you 're talking about ? 
   shame my dads such a cunt , and i 'd need to talk to him to get it sorted . 
  half-greek here . 
  same situation . 
  also jews were often prevented from operating in other industries so had few other options , but the association with money stuck . 
  i think i misread your post as providing an explanation for antisemitism itself rather than pointing to a reason for its escalation during the war . 
  come to the thread happy - leave feeling depressed . 
  the anti-jewish campaign began way before the war ( * mein kampf * was published in 1925 ) . 
  i 'm sure they were eager to have more ideological ammo against the jews but by the time the war started they did n't really need it . 
  part of doing ` you ' is being american , right ? 
  you can be yourself without bashing your country or thinking it 's superior to everyone else 's . 
  just be chill , be open to the new culture ( which does n't seem to be a problem for you ) , have fun and tutto andra ' bene . 
  my reddit time did dramatically improve once i ditched the default subs , it 's true . 
  i 'm pro-remain and not a fan of british exceptionalism , but the uk is hardly the only massively pro-us country in europe . 
   to be fair most people in roi seem to despise the uk and english people in my experience irish peeps may generally be critical of the british state but are usually totally fine with english folks ( as long as they 're not nationalistic ) . 
  also i do n't think you can argue that all the antipathy we have as a nation towards europe/the eu/non-anglo foreigners is because we think they do n't like us . 
  thanks ? 
   leadsom was really not a nice character never thought i 'd see the day when i 'd be relieved at may becoming next pm . 
  dark times . 
  or ... what 's ` conservative ' and ` progressive ' depends on context and the relevant society ? 
  in the uk gay marriage was passed by the conservative party . 
  not every country fits neatly into the model presented in that link . 
   and as long as western countries have n't invaded democratic countries we 've helped overthrow democratically elected governments - does that count ? 
  a majority of mps opposed brexit and the tory party were not unanimous in supporting leave ( they 're also extremely pro-business so should resent being dragged out of the single market ) . 
  any future pm has no mandate to rule out an eea deal without support . 
  this should be decided in parliament , not arbitrarily ruled out by these two pieces of work . 
  jesus what a fucking mess . 
  presumably the military will be better able to judge that than you . 
  i think it 's more simple than that - if the eu grants special favours to non-members it invalidates the whole point of membership and sets a bad precedent . 
  if they want to hold the union together they ca n't allow cherry-picking . 
  the cta between us is external to the eu though tbf . 
  i think the outcome will depend on how strong the anti-immigrant rhetoric remains weighed against how much a new hard border would fuck ni . 
   more pressing for us is the threat of the uk reinstating a hard border on the island . 
  i 'd say this would n't be likely because it 's madness , but , well ... 
  i 've been thinking about that movie a lot over the last couple of weeks ... 
  the brigaders crawl out from under their rock any time immigration and/or islam are mentioned . 
  many people here did n't vote ` leave ' based on informed opinion or logic . 
  or they actually believed it would damage the economy and voted to leave anyway ( like members of my family - `` meh , we 've had recessions before , we 'll have them again '' ) . 
  the eu/national governments have to find a way to persuade people away from movements like brexit , or it might not matter what the economic consequences are . 
  that seems fairly arbitrary tbh . 
  `` right guys , most of us are agreed we want/don ' t want ___ , and the country 's going to shit , but let 's just wait a few more years because reasons . '', 
  the eu population is 500 million , not 300 . 
  can brigaders from r/the _ donald at least do some basic fact-checking before weighing in with their important opinions ? 
  the guy you 're responding to is n't british fyi . 
  this 'll be hurting small businesses for sure , but ` ghost town ' is a bit of an exaggeration . 
  leavers will be protesting if we end up keeping freedom of movement . 
  millions protested in the uk over iraq in 2003 . 
  our governments do not give a fuck . 
  lots of good stuff for anyone who , like me is doing a ~ ~ useless ~ ~ social sciences degree . 
  ah , second british empire . 
  why was losing the us defining for the uk ? 
  wow you got it exactly right !, 
  how did you know ? 
  democracy is n't functioning when voters make decisions based on a campaign of lies and fairytales .
