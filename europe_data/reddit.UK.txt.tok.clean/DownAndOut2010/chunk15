  there is absolutely no chance of direct war against russia , especially over a region that * wants * to be russian and which no one cared about before the war . 
  the article says they 'll be considering the individual cases of the clean athletes , meaning in the case of the athletes winning the whole team wo n't be banned and the ruling is misleading . 
  i ca n't see that happening in scotland . 
  in england and wales i think it depends on how the next few years go ( for labour and the tories ) . 
  that would be arsehole town * . 
  [ channel 4 ] ( https://twitter.com/channel4news ) have announced that she has n't made it . 
  this sub is increasingly a shit show . 
  you can buy hunting rifles etc. 
  it 's just heavily regulated . 
  just anglo shit-talking about the eu as usual . 
  the union is always `` tottering '' , no matter what its circumstances are or how well it 's doing . 
  yeah , and you just took one comment to be representative of `` that lot '' , what 's your point ? 
  tbf i 've seen multiple comments in recent weeks from continentals expressing exactly the same wish for the uk if it leaves . 
   the sun never sets on the british empire ugh , do n't encourage them . 
  if we vote leave ( and i hope we do n't ) i might have to brexit / r/europe - i do n't want to read 2 years ' worth of outraged shit-posting . 
  i do n't understand the logic of ` labour ignored us so we 'll vote for a party who are not only apathetic towards us but are actively ** anti-working class ** '' . 
  the muslim population is heavily concentrated in the biggest cities . 
  for the vast majority of working-class england , eastern europeans will be seen as more directly competing for jobs and public services . 
  they 're one way of helping you function through the most intense parts of those ` bad ' periods . 
  i found the pills i took ( citalopram ) numbed me , which helped me stop feeling like every day was a crisis , but also stopped me feeling particularly happy so for me it was a short-term measure . 
  they helped me get through the worst point in three years of depression though , so they can definitely be useful . 
  i second the points above about therapy , social support , diet etc. 
  also , google ` self care ' . 
  i think if you can get an awareness of which people , activities , things etc make you feel shitty or better , you 'll make things easier on yourself in the long run . 
  method disclaimer : results may take 800 years to materialise . 
  it worked quite well , too , considering the shit show which was every thread relating to the fighting . 
  had some awesome food in poland !, 
  although i am english , so take that for what it 's worth ... 
  but do n't you know how much muslims breed ? 
  in 10 years that one muslim will be 20 million . 
  and then what ? 
  if we do n't brexit immediately , ** we 'll ** be brussels ' hat !, 
  and our children !, 
  and our children 's children !, 
  all hats !, 
  well , it 's politically expedient to paint any eu reaction or any potentially negative consequences as ` intimidation ' , which just proves why we need to ` escape ' asap . 
  * i have no idea what will happen , but any potential negative result is just scaremongering from remain !, 
  so is every country that 's the least bit eurosceptic a wannabe special snowflake ? 
  are the 40-odd percent of scots who are expected to vote leave small-minded rightwingers with a hard on for the empire glory days ? 
  i 'm not a brexiter , but i wish this facile generalisation would die . 
  if the uk is in the eu it can veto an army ( if it dislikes the proposals ) , no ? 
  let 's not add to this idea that everything gets forced on us with no input . 
  top trolling . 
  ~ ~ fair enough . 
  i 've honestly switched off from a lot of what the brexit campaign have been saying ( after years of it ) , so do n't often encounter the worst . ~ ~ edit : actually , scratch that . 
  if you 're reacting to genuine xenophobia and entitlement where you see it then fair enough . 
  this whole ` debate ' has been ugly , so i do n't blame people for getting a bad impression of the uk because of it . 
  please do n't think everyone voting leave is a xenophobe or hates the rest of europe though , because it 's not the case ( even if i do n't agree with ` leave ' and hope we vote to remain ) . 
  * spiteful and ungrateful member * ? 
  i 'm not a brexiter , but you seem to be taking this very personally . 
   why are you so hostile ? 
  welcome to r/europe !, 
  probably true ( scarily ) , at least militarily . 
  which is why the most ~ ~ messed up ~ ~ beautiful parts of england ( including my home town ) have danish names . 
  lol . 
  how the hell are those two equivalent ? 
  tfl are n't obligated to give advertising space to anyone they do n't want to . 
  if you 're worried that protein world have had their human rights violated , send a letter to tfl instead of outraging on reddit . 
  how is this ` censorship ' ? 
  this is commercial space rented to companies attempting to sell shit on london 's transportation , which tfl gets to select however it wants to . 
  it 's not a forum for public debate and free speech . 
  this blanket ` anti-pc ' brigading is getting tiresome . 
  edit : muh muslim mayor !, 
  muh pc gone mad !, 
  muh regressive left !, 
  etc , jerk ad nauseum . 
  because people are tying it to what they see as an overarching ` pc ' agenda which is out to distort the ` natural ' way of doing things , limit freedom of speech , pander to minorities etc. 
  that 's just spin silly . 
  the bbc made the whole thing up just to make us look less bad . 
  not in this sub they 're not . 
  it 's a small update in uniform policy which will barely affect anyone . 
  the `` funded '' part refers to the campaign in general , not specifically to this update in uniform policy ( which is a pretty small measure ) . 
  that 's eton college ( an elite prep school in the uk ) . 
  do n't know why they used it in the article . 
  are you posting this on every thread in r/europe ? 
  any time !, 
  no really , every time :'( ... 
  * are * people accessing that information though ? 
  apparently not , if the various polls and articles that get posted here often are anything to go by . 
  so what 's your solution ( other than brexit , which wo n't be decided completely based on informed opinion ) . 
  it was a joke . 
  still if brexit happens i think the snp will push for another referendum . 
  you ** could ** reserve judgement , or you could just shit post based on perceptions about the ` british character ' and bitterness over brexit . 
  move to scotland ? 
  true . 
  both parties are lagely driven by the same ideology now ( at least economically speaking ) . 
  when it 's relative to other countries she 's a ` strong leader ' , apply that to the uk and i can see the press very quickly painting her as an interfering bully out to dominate the whole continent . 
  tory logic - national ownership of infrastructure is great !, 
  but only when it 's a foreign nation . 
  * one of us , one of us !, 
  i do n't think it 's because people are stupid , i think it 's because the government has done a terrible job explaining what the eu is and what it does ( even in the run up to the referendum ) . 
  we 're not talking about the intricasies of eu law , but basic facts about its structure and how it operates . 
  the result is people on either side of the arument might not know what the fuck they 're talking about . 
  and there are british ` expats ' in spain who vote ukip and froth at the mouth at immigration to the uk . 
  we 've come full circle . 
   and british hooligans get to racially insult our locals oh man , i was in paris when the metro incident happened . 
  did not feel good to be british that day . 
  i 'm afraid of the uk 's `` democratic processes '' , and i definitely do not trust our system . 
  `` in today 's news - redditors salty about brexit . '', 
  afaik central europeans are n't known for being criminals , and the vast majority of them work ( and work hard ) .
