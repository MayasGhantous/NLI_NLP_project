  then there 's no reason to object , is there ? 
  does n't the uk stat include part-time and zero-hours work ? 
   it also closely resembles the disgusting levels of protectionism they impose in reference to the french film and tv industry . 
  this is a good thing imo . 
  how else are you supposed to compete with hollywood ? 
  the only solution is regional devolution . 
  #heptarchy 4life #freemercia, 
  their flag seems to be suggesting some sort of union ... we could swap them for scotland ? 
  how is the uk so ( comparatively ) low ? 
  greece gets to stay in eternal debt-bondage to keep the euro afloat . 
  why do n't they realise how easy they have it ? 
  they had a chance to have a referendum , in fact they ** wanted ** a referendum . 
  but then merkel noped it and papandreou accepted the bailouts . 
   but i do n't think that it 's the prevailing view . 
  it 's certainly not the prevailing view in spain . 
  i would say that it 's not prevailing in france and uk , in the uk i think this is usually the case if you 're white , but becomes trickier if you 're not . 
  i view people raised here who identify as a brit/english etc as a brit or english , whatever their background , but not everyone does . 
  also , people who are n't white more readily identify with [ ` britishness ' ] ( https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/research/publications/working-paper/understanding-society/2013-08.pdf ) than with ` english-ness ' , ` scottish-ness ' etc , since ` british ' is already a pluralistic label . 
   europe is still ethnically very homogeneous and your ethnicity is a big deal . 
  it 's ethnically homogeneous * now * . 
  it used to look like [ this clusterfuck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_of_westphalia#/media/file:europe_map_1648.png ) . 
  multi-ethnic states have been around here for a long time ( rome , turkey , hapsburg empire , russia etc ) . 
  even each state which is organised along ` ethnic ' lines breaks down at the regional level ( cornishmen , bretons , occitans , bavarians , sicilians , moravians and so on and so on ) . 
  i think it 's messier than people realise . 
  they were invaded , creating power vacuums filled by people funded by the west and saudi arabia ? 
  the tabloid created kind . 
   the us-uk are far less foreign to each other than brussels is to ** me ** . 
  ftfy . 
  we do n't all think that way ( i certainly do n't ) . 
  which politicians are those ? 
  where do they dominate politics and media ? 
  not in the uk they do n't . 
  we use both . 
  `` dark ages '' is becoming a bit less popular now that our understanding of northern europe at the time has improved ( you do n't really think `` barbarian '' when you look at the book of kells , the lindisfarne gospels , the icelandic sagas etc ) . 
  i think you need to be asking poles who have some experience of the uk , because natives wo n't notice so much what 's going on unless it 's very overt . 
  otherwise i would say that yes , overt hostility is probably more common in socially/economically deprived areas . 
   i sense butthurt . 
  that would be the many comments you 're posting in an attempt to justify slave labour . 
  not as much no . 
  still happens though . 
  it 's almost like a country can do more than one thing at a time !, 
  it 's commentors circlejerking over muslims annoying me tbh rather than grillo . 
  suppose i should get used to a future in which people lap this shit up because it 's `` anti-establishment '' etc. 
  so that 's the gdp graph ? 
  makes sense . 
  well , you did n't really explain your point in any detail so i do n't feel the standard of discussion is particularly high . 
  if i 'm on the wrong track feel free to explain how i 've misunderstood . 
  edit : although i suppose ` rubla ' says more than a well thought-out response ever could . 
  leftwinger here !, 
  do people still actually listen to varoufakis ? 
  so what , it 's better if they can shoot people instead ? 
  i mean , the idea that voting for one of two parties that have a monopoly on resources and media attention once every 4 or 5 years = the will of the people does n't seem particularly democratic either . 
  thank you !, 
  there 's a magnificent amount of salt and projecting in these comments . 
  i do n't understand what difference it 'll make . 
  it 's not like a brexit would mean the uk floating off into space , and presumably the motivation for people to learn english wo n't change significantly . 
  first goal is to improve my shitty italian ( hope to get to c1 by next year ) . 
  my next language will be french or spanish , but i also really like czech and greek . 
  reformed english orthography would probably be butt-ugly though . 
  i ** wish ** that was the most difficult part of greek and slavic languages ... 
  i was joking ( badly ) . 
  i was just in hungary . 
  that 's like 100 euros right ? 
  aaand we 've gone full circle back to crazy . 
  russia thinks it can intimidate glorious british baltic clay ? 
  napoleonic wars were basically concluded in war of 1812 by glorious murican military . 
  you need to make it funny so people know it 's a joke . 
  that was my point . 
  did stalin ** personally ** kill hundreds of thousands of people all by himself ? 
  the abrahamic faiths do not have a monopoly on marriage ( which predates them all ) . 
  right , because marriage , a purely sociological phenomenon is indeed determined by biology . 
  because gay rights and the decline of oppressive institutions that caused suffering for centuries is new world order homo-gender jewish conspiracy , duh . 
  as a brit , i do n't view foreign accents as `` incorrect '' . 
  if you 're understandable , and you pronounce words clearly then you 're speaking english . 
  that 's because ... we got them from french ? 
  are all your language 's foreign borrowings `` faux '' too ? 
  yep !, 
  our orthography is n't phonetic . 
  welcome to english . 
  asking them ? 
  that 's exactly the sort of evil , deceptive thing we ( the english ) would do . 
  using ` uk ' instead of ` england ' takes so much effort . 
  it 's not * just * about religion though . 
  ordinary communities built those buildings . 
  i 'm not religious either but you ca n't replace the cultural , artistic and social heritage that 's lost when they get destroyed . 
  their documentaries tend to be simplified because it 's the bbc 's ` youth ' channel . 
  the genetic population of modern day england has stayed the same for 10,000-ish years ( see cheddar man ) . 
  successive invasions have n't made any radical difference . 
  nice try though  . 
  one hand for burger , one hand for gun . 
  yeah , a few islands . 
  your country took half a continent just in the last two centuries and still has it . 
   the irony of some yank talking about land grabs is n't lost on me the difference between our two nations is we had to give up our empire , you still have yours  . 
  also , i 'm not defending british colonialism or our theft of cultural artefacts ( which i agree should be returned ) , just questioning that point about ` importance ' . 
  ( edited some words ), 
   land is n't anywhere near the same yeah , i 'm sure native people are totally chill about the land thefts that were occurring into the 19th century , or that the black mountain ( which was sacred to them ) had presidents faces carved onto it . 
  check out the general difference between comments posted by brits in r/europe and r/unitedkingdom . 
  til ireland should belong to britain ( sorry ireland ) because it 's close to us . 
  sri lanka should go to india . 
  japan can be north korean .
