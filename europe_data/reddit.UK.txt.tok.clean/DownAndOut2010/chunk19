  * have you any plans later ? 
  * does n't really sound natural now , outside of victorian literature . 
  suuure they do . 
   a lot in the center have as much disdain for the guardian/wapo/independent , for their preachy editorializing , as they have for breitbart , lol, 
   i really do not see how this could aid his cause however . 
  presumably shit-stirring so brexiters can get off on how mean those damn continentals are . 
  yeah , fuck all those children for not dragging their arses down to the voting booths !, 
  beyoglu is so fucking pretty . 
  oh god , why did i click, 
  thanks for the consideration !, 
  i enjoyed this video greatly though . 
  true . 
  italiano ? 
  the number is difficult to establish for the uk , because when people * say * they 're christian , they often mean `` i more or less believe in god and go to church for weddings , baptisms and funerals '' . 
  well ( for the next two years anyway ) there 's scotland , where you can get free tuition if you 've been resident for 3 years . 
  hw\u00e6t !, 
  google alex jones ? 
  no thanks , i 'd rather not get cancer . 
  honestly , i was thinking about this and i reckon if leave had lost the problem would n't have ended there . 
  farage had already said he would n't give up if remain won , and we could have ended up with greater election success for ukip . 
  the gov would have put the idea of a referendum to bed , but they 'd have been forced to continue chasing the rabid eurosceptic vote and to be seen to be more ` tough ' on europe . 
  same . 
  this is what gets me about extreme nationalist types , i 'm supposed to feel commonality with these fucks just because we have the same skin tone ? 
  fuck that . 
  i do n't know what to expect any more tbh , so who knows . 
  how about uk ? 
  we 're now part of r/europe 's glorious axis of evil , along with russia , turkey and the us . 
  the uk leaving could be what finally allows the eu to get closer , if it can survive the populist trend over the next few years . 
  because we left the continent ? 
  does spain acknowledge its different parts as countries , rather than regions ? 
  that 's the difference . 
  it 's an acknowledgement that there 's more than one country . 
  when the uk was created , there were two countries , scotland and england ( since wales was n't an acknowledged country during that time ) . 
  as long as there 's england + 1 , there can be a uk . 
  equally though , how do we know the uk * did * block measures if negotiations happened behind closed doors ? 
  why is that selfish ? 
  not nearly enough people are considering northern ireland , as far as i can see . 
  the uk voted against eu laws [ 2 % ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-facts-behind-claims-uk-influence/ ) of the time from 1999 . 
  no we did n't though ? 
  the name is n't * united kingdoms * . 
  it 's ` kingdom consisting of ____ united areas ' . 
  well brits have n't exactly been covering themselves in glory in r/europe over the last few years tbh . 
  but even though i hate a lot about what 's going on in the uk right now , i feel like this sub has formed a very warped ( and extreme ) view of the country that i do n't feel matches reality . 
   it is not `` condescending . '', 
  it is tbh . 
  i 'm vehemently anti-brexit but the `` brits and their empire '' generalisations are way off base . 
  i do n't even hear racist little englander types saying this stuff . 
  if anything it says more about how the continent sees the uk than it does about the uk . 
   it 's going to suck for a bit , but long term we can do pretty well out of it . 
  some will . 
  i 'm not convinced those at the bottom of the pile will benefit . 
  it was mostly post-2004 eu immigration that drove brexit , not mena immigration . 
  shame most of them probs wo n't apply the same reasoning to the debate on scottish independence . 
   vegemite is a bit different ( better ) . 
  would n't surprise me - marmite is fucking foul . 
  upvoted for impressive level of passive-aggressiveness . 
  being one of the most powerful members of the union with the most opt-outs of any member state equals `` being told to shut up '' ? 
  lol . 
   weird friends ? 
  that 's not a very nice way to describe australia ( although i 'm told veggiemite is a bit different ) . 
  r/europe is polandball with added bitterness . 
  i see a lot of ` fuck england ' type comments here tbh . 
   but i do understand the context that drove them to terrorism . 
  would you apply this same nuance to islamic terrorism ? 
  really ? 
  i thought it was the opposite . 
  people in the north use ` cunt ' in that way a lot in my experience . 
   europeans end up saying `` enough is enough '' and ban muslims from immigration to the continent . 
  most muslims in the uk and france ( for example ) have been here for generations already . 
  you can not `` ban '' millions of citizens from their own countries . 
  my god . 
  `` chocolate born . '', 
  he 's being investigated because people complained . 
  until we figure out a way to thwart that blasted foreign sun . 
  this is basically the attitude of reddit . 
  nothing is right , nothing is wrong . 
  `` heiress to the nutella fortune . '', 
  touch\u00e9 :p . 
  no worries !, 
  probably should have made my op clearer . 
  and ruled ioannina . 
  the point being what he did is relevant to greek history , not that i 'm claiming he was greek . 
   that 's contradictory . 
  not really . 
  it was the military dictatorship that invented democracy in 1973 . 
  after that the junta voluntarily relinquished power and established the parliamentary system in greece . 
  the world saw how well this new system worked , and throughout the late 70s and 80s slowly adopted democracy . 
  true , but you got a fascist government instead though . 
  despite being half-greek , i do n't actually know that much about the country , but i 'll give it a crack . 
  besides being the cradle of western civilization ... 
  they chased the invading italians out of greece in wwii , and after the war were stabbed in the back by the uk which supported the dictatorship ( classic uk ) . 
  suffered mutual devastation with turks thanks to the expulsions ( one of my greek friends has family who once lived all over the former ottoman empire , but now they all live in athens ) . 
  when i was in czechia i discovered that some of the [ men ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_ypsilantis ) who fought in the war against the ottomans were [ imprisoned ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgios_lassanis ) at terezin by the austrians who had a treaty with the ottoman empire . 
  [ ali pasha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ali_pasha_of_ioannina#atrocities ) was a brutal bastard . 
  [ edit : i 'm not saying ali pasha was greek ! ], 
  greek is a beautiful language but confuses the hell out of me . 
  how the fuck do you get \u03ae\u03c1\u03b8\u03b1 ( i did come ) from \u03ad\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 ( i come ) ?!, 
  produces sweet hip-hop like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4xswgwovyu&amp;index=3&amp;list=plppbuwergn4t48kuokgmchjoq-_7-mb5b ) , and crazy movies like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qftdzk64-pk ) . 
  does n't pagan refer to people of non-abrahamic faiths ? 
  guy 's either a masochist or enjoys baiting salty r/europe redditors .
