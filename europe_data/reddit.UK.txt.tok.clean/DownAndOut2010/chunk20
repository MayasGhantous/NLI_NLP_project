   but ottoman empire was imperialist and expansionary an empire was imperialist and expansionist ? 
  i am shocked . 
  we 're talking about the people who voted to stay and got screwed . 
  if your response is `` fuck them because fuck brits '' , you need to grow up and stop being so petty . 
  you mean the 17 million that voted to stay ? 
  the ones we 're talking about above ? 
  jesus you 're bitter . 
  you 're right , but on the other hand emigrating takes money and many people are forced to stay due to circumstances ( family , debt etc ) . 
  for many people it 's not as simple as just learning a new language and going . 
  there will be people unable to move who want to remain eu citizens but instead will end up screwed . 
  i 'm offended by your logical error . 
  if you want to bash the uk be my guest , at least be coherent about it . 
  that 's not what you said though , you said ` they ' ( the uk ) . 
  meaning you specifically used an extreme example to trash the uk as a whole . 
  farage is the uk now ? 
  til . 
  you know many euro countries have these fringe parties , right ? 
  please think more carefully before shit posting . 
  wow such concern . 
  thanks . 
  it 's not included in the union flag because when the flag was created wales was a part of england . 
  just r/europe things . 
  the uk has been one of the most outspoken countries against putin . 
  try again . 
  lol yes , because of course it 's possible for 17 million or so brits to just move to the continent . 
  their debt to gdp ratio might be an issue . 
  r/europe is a weird bubble though . 
  i do n't think it 's always an accurate representation of general european opinion . 
  for you maybe . 
  i have to live with these people . 
  on the other hand , everyone likes them ( apart from r/the _ donald ) and they get to be smug about everything . 
  g\u00fclen got to moody 's now too ? 
  only appropriate way to get around london tbh . 
  the majority of american voters ? 
  i do n't disagree with any of that . 
  what i disagree with is england and scotland being painted as polar opposites ( particularly in this sub ) based on a 14 % margin . 
  i do n't disagree with that . 
  i live in scotland and the political climate is totally different to ruk , especialy regarding europe . 
  still though i 'm not sure it 's as pro-europe as this sub thinks it is ( although maybe that would change for an indy scotland in the eu ) . 
  probably . 
  it 's easy to do but it contributes nothing . 
  you do n't think a 38 % vote for leave is an indication of euroscepticism ? 
  i 'm not talking about scotland wanting to leave the uk ( i totally understand their reasons for that ) . 
  i 'm talking about people ignoring what are still high levels of euroscepticism in scotland , especially here in r/europe . 
  i 'm pro remain , pro indy for scotland ( if they want it ) , and do n't blame them for wanting to ditch the uk . 
  but surely a 38 % vote for leave is still a * bad * result ? 
  at the very least it points to a high degree of euroscepticism . 
  i do n't get the narrative that scotland is overwhelmingly different from england in this regard when there was only a 14 % difference . 
  r/europe wo n't like that . 
  presumably because the uk has its own operations or coordinates with nato ( getting up to shenanigans in the middle east ) , rather than contributing to un led operations . 
   substitute turkey with the united states , and most of your comment holds true there too . 
  substitute turkey with the uk , and most of your comment probably holds true there too . 
  interesting you said this because that was exactly my thought . 
  people have accepted the narrative that the swing to the right in the uk/us is a natural consequence of the neglect of sections of society by an out of touch elite , while for turkey it 's essentialized as just more muslim crazy that needs no explanation . 
  shocking . 
  unfortunately those consequences may also fall on the hundreds of thousands of eu citizens living in the uk . 
  obviously this is the uk 's fault , but ` fuck you ' is n't an option in this case , unless you 're happy to see people 's lives ruined out of spite . 
  have they asked for one ? 
  i 'm more a heptarchy fan myself . 
  london can break away and be the evil city state it always wanted to be , and england can devolve into northumbria , wessex and mercia again . 
  / u/blussy96 is right , according to the [ last census ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24302914 ) younger people are slightly more likely to identify as solely british than old people . 
  the number is still low though ( the bbc analysis puts it at around 20 % for the under 60s ) . 
  the relevant paragraphs are near the top of the article :  in england and wales , the generation least likely to have ticked the box marked `` british '' to describe their national identity are those who lived through the war and watched the sun set on the british empire . 
   more than 20 % of people under 60 picked british as their sole identity . 
  among the over-75s , it was just 13 % . 
  suggestions that the british identity is gradually dying out are contradicted by the statistics . 
  although that does n't distinguish between generations under the age of 60 , so i wonder if there 's any difference within that bracket . 
  i do think scots seem to react differently to english peeps who are perceived to be from a certain background than how they will to other types of englishman . 
  it 's one of the few ways in which coming from a crap northern town has been to my benefit . 
  that 's funny because in a way i felt * less * english after going to edinburgh for uni . 
  :p or at least maybe i feel more northern english than ** english ** . 
  it 's complicated . 
  according to the last uk census , the english were only 2 % behind the scottish in identifying exclusively with their home country over british identity . 
  i think the uk in its old form has run its course and either needs to radically change or a complete breakup is inevitable . 
  it 's not exactly on the tourist trail for football hooligans . 
   people at 8 am pissing and puking on historic monuments and throwing stuff at each other `` do n't be about brits , do n't be about bri ... oh , phew . 
  carry on . '', 
  congratulations , slovenia is now the 5th country of uk . 
  ( edit : you too croatia . ), 
  also istanbul just comes from greek anyway so i do n't know why people have to act like using constantinople is some kind of stance . 
  you 're expecting brits to understand schengen and the eu ? 
  good luck with that . 
  someone 's never been to ibiza ... 
  aristotle was rediscovered in western europe from the 12th to 13th centuries though ( presumably via moorish spain ) , so i do n't think it 's quite correct to speak of two separate renaissances . 
  and how is that objectively comparable to being executed or expelled ? 
  i never said it was easy to be non-muslim in the ottoman empire , my point is that it was less terrible than being muslim or jewish in christian europe ( for most of its history ) . 
  you think that compares to a thousand years of murdering non-christians or expelling them ? 
  what happened after the reconquista ? 
  what christians did in the new world ? 
  i do n't care if this sub has an anti-islam boner , the idea that islam has historically been more antagonistic than christianity is ludicrous . 
  and if everyone was doing it , why the pedantic reply to the op that suggested orthodox culture was present within the ottoman empire ? 
  the renaissance started before constantinople fell . 
  better than just killing or expelling all the unbelievers like christian europe repeatedly did . 
  people here do seem disproportionately keen on the idea of the uk breaking up . 
  this is fair enough if a majority of people in ni , scotland etc want to leave , but to actively hope for an end to the uk strikes me as an odd thing for foreigners to be invested in . 
  i said ` largely ' , not ` in every case ' . 
  the us , canada , aus and new zealand have all done very well but they are settler societies in which much of the native populations were displaced or killed . 
   also south afica sa was settled , although not on the levels seen in aus or the us . 
   also india ( soon to be economic super power ) are you suggesting ** we 're ** responsible for that ? 
  in any case gdp per capita is still abysmal .
