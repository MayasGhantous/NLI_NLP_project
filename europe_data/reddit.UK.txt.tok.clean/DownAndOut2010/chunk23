  i 've always thought the us is crazy for the general stance on nationalised healthcare because ` government interference ' and then realise we have a less extreme version of the same attitude in the uk . 
  i do n't think it 's a sinking ship * economically * , it will be one socially though or in terms of quality of life if we 're left alone with the tories ' unfettered vision of what britain should be . 
  no human rights act , no ecj to mediate , nhs in danger of being dismantled , snooper 's charter and more draconian legislation to come , the appeasement of right-wing discourse which is inflaming xenophobia ... it 's not looking like a country i 'd like to stake my future on tbh . 
  i do n't know about ` bitch ' but unless something happens to make them desperate to get the uk back ( which i highly doubt will happen ) , we 'll get none of the privileges we had before . 
  i imagine they 'll want assurance that we 'll fully embrace the project , not just straddle both sides of the line to get the best of both worlds . 
  yeah , and now with the dent to her pension caused by the collapse of the pound she 'll be forced to work until she 's 135 . 
  establishment gon na establishment . 
  it 's never going to change , they 've been evil bastards for centuries and they 'll continue to be evil bastards . 
  i would use the above examples , so i 'm not sure where op is getting this . 
  several british cities ( birmingham , manchester , bristol , glasgow , hull , coventry , liverpool ... ) were bombed fyi , not just london . 
  though i 've heard ksa had been trying to spread wahabism to south eastern europe . 
  soldiers in the uk usually are n't carrying machine guns though . 
  only an idiot would mess with the guys patrolling central paris . 
  * red , white * and * blue * facts . 
  what , like that time we got absolutely smashed at gallipoli ? 
  wow , and we thought we had it bad . 
  fucking hell germany , poland and russia . 
  when did parliament surrender that right ? 
   when the parliament removes themselves from the decision making process , like they did , they are obliged to support democratic decision made by the majority of the people or step down ( david cameron ) . 
  but you see , in the uk parliament is sovereign . 
  we are not a direct democracy . 
  the government attempting to do something so important without parliamentary scrutiny is unconstitutional . 
  it is against the legal system brexiters wish to be completely independent . 
  and as much as ` haters ' say this is against the will of the people ^ tm , it is a good thing the government can not do whatever the fuck it wants and circumvent uk law . 
  presumably you 're not so hysterically fanatical about brexit that you ca n't see why the government behaving like a dictatorship is a bad thing ? 
  you might like the idea of the gov doing this for something you support - what if next time it 's for something you do n't ? 
  the government denies the will of the people after every general election when they betray a campaign promise . 
  the government is denying the will of the people by dragging the uk out of the single market when a majority elected them in 2015 under a manifesto which included a commitment to staying within the single market . 
   the parliament vote was forced by the courts and everyone who voted against the bill denied democracy . 
  ok , so it 's the duty of the opposing party to always ** agree ** with the ruling party because a majority elected them ? 
  was leave ` against the will of the people ' when it campaigned for decades for brexit even when a majority of people supported remain ? 
  democracy does not mean everyone agrees/a dictatorship of the majority . 
  it means the majority wins , not the removal of opposing opinion . 
   really trumps gone ? 
  oh yeah right . 
  this bullshit again . 
  i 'm referring to the labour whip , not to the bill passing . 
  the bill would have passed anyway . 
   the function of democracy is to eventually come to a single decision , using a consensus and majority system . 
  otherwise we would have dictators or kings/queens making our decisions . 
  our system means the majority wins , it does not mean the end to a plurality of opinions , or that the minority loses representation . 
  a political party 's duty is to represent the views of its voters , not to side the the majority , otherwise what 's the fucking point of voting for anyone ? 
  a political party ignoring the wishes of their voters is not an indication of functioning democracy . 
  too late !, 
  i crept in while you lot were n't looking . 
  now hurry up and vote indy so i can get citizenship . 
  i feel like only someone on the far right would call r/askeurope ultra left wing , unless you 're being sarcastic . 
  / r/askeurope is the non bitter version of this sub . 
  we need something like that that 's not confined to question threads . 
  do you ** want ** every last thread in this sub to be about brexit/putin/trump / refugees ? 
  apparently you do . 
  well , that and europe had a head start because we revolutionised technology . 
  can we not do this every fucking thread that mentions turkey ? 
  are they experiencing a come back then ? 
  i thought they became less popular after killah p was murdered and their leader ( ? ), 
  was arrested . 
  til nato does n't exist . 
  of course you 're going to pin it on ` the left ' because that allows you to dismiss it as irrational partisan politics . 
  and as i see it it 's valuable as a statement of public opinion , if nothing else . 
  that 's what protesting often boils down to , and i 'd argue that 's still valid in a democracy , even if ` wo n't change government policy tho lolol ' . 
  at the very least it means the government are aware of the fact the public actually give a shit about issues like torture . 
  also hamas have been democratically elected , do you not have an opinion on their policies ? 
  as far as i 'm aware polling has consistently shown majority public disapproval for trump , so it 's nice to hear you support the petition . 
  i guess protest votes are only valid when it 's for brexit ? 
  i ca n't believe after all this time people do n't realise he 's joking . 
  mexico can into nordic . 
  `` millions of mexican muslims set to flood uk after eu expansion , trusted sources on reddit have revealed . '', 
  - daily mail 2017 . 
  she 's getting away with doing worse than thatcher managed , ironically . 
  scunthorpe is another underrated gem . 
  ha , i lived at the foot of the walk for a year and a half . 
  you 're right , that part of the city is n't the happiest . 
  i quite liked it though . 
  hogmanay :p . edinburgh usually gets happy rather than hostile when people are pissed , so you probably got lucky and found the arsehole minority who just wanted a go . 
  sorry you had a bad experience in edinburgh . 
  i 'm english and have lived here for 4 years , have n't experienced anything like that so far . 
  ` welcomed them ' ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  again , i do n't know why you 're saying all this to me ? 
  i 'm pro-eu , and anti-brexit . 
  i 'm not saying ` not all brits ' , i 'm saying it 's literally pointless you saying all this because i already agree with you . 
   being vassalized by the usa is that what you voted for ? 
  privatized healthcare ... maybe frakking oil drilling in the middle of london ? 
  what about assault rifles for any citizens ? 
  i did n't vote for leave , so i do n't know who you 're aiming this at . 
   yeah the uk invented the shia/sunni conflict erm , isis did n't find a neat vacuum to fill in iraq and syria because of ` the shia/sunni conflict ' . 
   the british parliament is not going to accept her hard stance agains ' t the eu , not going to accept to be vassalizied by the usa this is absolutely the last thing i want , but unless we can avoid hard brexit ( which seems increasingly unlikely ) it 's a done deal . 
  the problem is getting drunk is seen as admirable , it 's the focus of socialising . 
  especially when you 're younger , if you 're not getting absolutely thrashed every weekend there 's something wrong with you . 
  it used to be promoted that way iirc . 
  now the businesses there promote drinking/package tourism so that 's what the island is getting . 
  are americans really unaware of chavs ? 
  seems like it 's a pretty well referenced stereotype among american redditors . 
  cromwell really was a cunt . 
  it 's a shame we do n't really ever get taught ( in england ) about the shit he did outside the context of the civil war . 
  i never knew any of this . 
  well , there is a suspicious number of foreigners in this solar system ... 
  it 's not right , i tell you . 
  we 're not able to blame people for their electoral choices , because if we do they 'll apparently be forced to keep making bad electoral choices . 
  its his policies that are rattling people , not just the speed at which he implements them .
