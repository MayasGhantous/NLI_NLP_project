  you ca n't have your cake and eat it . '' . 
  eu and eea are not the same thing . 
   the current year . 
  glad we finally have a concrete plan . 
  was getting worried there for a minute . 
  yep , plenty of uninformed people to be seen in conversations about northern ireland and the uk . 
  also ethnic minorities who feel excluded from englishness etc , and see ` british ' as a more inclusive label . 
  a majority of people in britain see themselves as exclusively scottish/english/welsh now ( though that does n't necessarily mean people want the uk to break up ) . 
  welcome to any thread about scotland or northern ireland that makes the front page . 
   also funny that in the netherlands we currently have a higher percentage of english speakers than in the uk wow . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  that 's kind of my point , labour has no decent alternatives . 
  therefore i do n't think it 's fair to blame corbyn alone for labour 's failures , when they 've been doing such a good job at being shit without him . 
  that is n't anyone , based on who 's recently campaigned for leadership . 
  ( edited a word . ), 
  how dare you . 
  economic liberalism is british tradition , we were at it before it was cool . 
  sure , i 'd be happy to take donegal off your hands if you do n't want it . 
  that is absolutely insane . 
  i have to travel sheffield  edinburgh next week ( a shorter distance than your example journey in poland ) and same-day 2nd class is # 100 . 
  first class is at least twice that amount . 
  sweet jesus . 
  is that advance tickets or same-day ? 
  that 's a better plan than any i 've heard in the last few months tbh . 
  someone make this happen . 
  why has no one thought of this already ? 
  make doggerland great again . 
  doggerland never forget . 
  pls no more than 20 degrees . 
   furthermore you hit the issue of orkney and shetland never having independent sovereignty so there is issues of legality to address amongst other things . 
  solution : reform the [ kingdom of the isles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_isles#/media/file:kingdom_of_mann_and_the_isles-en.svg ), 
  anglos are confident in dating ? 
  so that 's where i 've been going wrong . 
  good point . 
  i agree with u/istencsaszar 's general point that the ` nation ' as we think of it today is a fairly recent development , i just was n't sure about the timescale . 
  is n't the treaty of westphalia ( 1648 ) the date marking the beginnings of the modern nation-state ? 
  it 's not just us pissing off locals ? 
  hooray !, 
   there 's something quite unique about the european movie scene which makes it stand out from all the big budget stuff coming from hollywood . 
  because european countries ( particularly france ) have been putting out decent films for a long time that do n't treat lgbt issues as tragic . 
  hollywood produces decent queer movies too , but it 's the miserable ones that tend to win awards . 
  yep , and * underground * by the same director . 
   bullshit , what constitutes freedom of speech is subjective . 
  then why make an absolute comparison ( ` one of the * worst * ' ) , rather than merely saying it 's bad in the uk ? 
   so ** objectively ** they are the worst that i know in freedom of speech so what constitutes freedom of speech is subjective , except when selectively applied by you to the uk ? 
   if you can provide an example of other eu nations that block freedom of speech as much as happens in the uk i am will to concede my point . 
  nope . 
  you made the claim , not me . 
  that 's your job , if you have any wish not to look uninformed . 
  in sum , no you ca n't back up your claim . 
  i think we 've both wasted enough time on this . 
  take it easy . 
   fair enough but i wasnt really commenting on specific type of brexit . 
  ok , but the issue is n't the eu here , it 's staying within the single market/eea . 
  that 's the point of the article . 
  i 'm not asking what your views on freedom of speech are . 
  i 'm asking you ( and have done repeatedly ) to demonstrate how the uk is objectively much worse than other countries for freedom of speech , as per your original claim . 
  in other words , where 's your evidence that the majority of countries are better ? 
  if it is just your opinion , if you ca n't show what that opinion is based on then it 's an uninformed one amounting to little more than hyperbole . 
  note that this is about the uk and eea rather than the eu exactly . 
  the government have said they 're going to push for ` hard brexit ' meaning they 'll take us out of the single market as well as the political union . 
  the challenge is arguing they have no mandate for this . 
  pfft , there are [ 17 euro countries ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/percentage-of-obese-population-by-country-in-europe-map/ ) within 5 percentage points of the uk statistic , so i would n't be so sure . 
   that 's only because they 've been living in a gluttonous society for a few more decades than europe as a result of europe destroying itself twice in rapid succession . 
  wait a few decades and europe will be equally fat , europeans are already catching up pretty quickly . 
  by that logic the uk should be less fat than countries with a higher gdp per capita like norway , sweden and france , which is not the case . 
  i do n't dispute that there are issues with press freedom and freedom of speech in the uk ( because there clearly are ) . 
  what i 'm questioning is your position that the uk is among the * worst * for those things . 
  so far you 've failed to demonstrate ** how ** it is one of the worst ( you 've chosen one issue from the uk without comparative information from other countries ) , meaning for now it 's an unqualified assumption of yours presented as fact . 
  1 ) in europe the uk is middle-ranking ( france and italy both score below in the rpb list ) , meaning it 's still not ` one of the worst ' . 
  2 ) i 'll take the word of rpb over yours , especially since you 've provided no comparative stats to back up your statements . 
  ok , but how is that ` one of the worst ' ? 
  [ reporters without borders ] ( https://rsf.org/en/ranking ) has the uk ranked 38th in 2016 for press freedoms . 
  wow , that poster is much better than real evidence . 
  they have n't won an election since 2005 , scotland has completely abandoned them , all the alternative leaders they proposed to corbyn are shit . 
  so no , it 's not just corbyn . 
  labour is fucked even without corbyn , so no . 
   the uk is one of the worst on freedom of speech . 
  can you back this statement up ? 
  most cctv is commercial or private ( because we have a lot of petty crime ) , it 's not all being watched by big brother . 
  i enjoyed this comment , i have to say . 
  is the us an authoritarian regime because of the patriot act ? 
  nope , it 's all left/right-wing bias , apparently . 
  no la spezia ( the most beautiful village of all ) ... ? 
  seriously though , i need to see more of liguria . 
  the eu which they dominate ( along with germany ) ? 
  same . 
  reminds me of the opening scene of * master and margarita * . 
  except one of the characters is a snowman . 
  does she hate the uk ? 
  i only see her trashing brexit , not the country . 
  you said :  yup , a nation bigger than europe you did not say :  yup , a nation bigger than any in europe, 
  every russian is invading europe now ? 
  how about treating people according to their actions as individuals and not confusing them with their government ? 
  when did the people in this sub become such bitter bastards ? 
  the us is not bigger than europe . 
  presumably why i 'm seeing fewer and fewer posts from russians here . 
  where ? 
  flair up bruh , so i can insult your country in return . 
  same .
