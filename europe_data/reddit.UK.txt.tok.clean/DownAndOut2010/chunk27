  hoping to see wroclaw , gdansk and torun next year . 
  if it happens again we 'll sort you guys out with another operation anthropoid . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  oh here we go . 
  except for us for some reason ( if we still count ) ? 
  61 % despite the current eu-phobia is quite good imo , and i guess 50 % is more than i expected from you guys :p . 
  all the drunken brits in prague and czechs still like us ? 
  you guys are my heroes . 
  i 'd say until recently ` expats ' were people with money or people from ` good ' countries like france , benelux , scandi or five eyes countries , japan etc. 
  ` immigrants ' are generally viewed to be from countries that have any taint of economic hardship ( and also non-whites by racists ) . 
  i 'm not qualified to venture an opinion , but [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sami_languages ) refers to a family rather than a single language . 
  i find that quite odd to be honest ( and depressing ) considering britain has been multi-ethnic and multi-racial for 60 odd years now , or longer . 
  that 's unfortunate , but is england exceptional to europe in this regard ? 
  also this could be more about the particular place you 're living in than anything else . 
  i 'm from an almost completely white-british ( and poor ) area in the north of england and the mindset seems to be different to the one people have in the cities . 
  because i have no life obvs , like most people who frequent this sub . 
  why do you care that he cares ? 
  you 're not forced to answer , and civil rights groups use the data provided by the census ? 
  do you have anything to back that up or illustrate your point ? 
  also how is it falling ? 
  the population was only 20 million a century ago . 
  now 85 % of 65 million are white , meaning the white british population has actually grown . 
  of course to some people , not being completely white-brit = ` genocide ' . 
  so two places ? 
  well that 's the result of centuries of indian colonialism , unfortunately . 
  yeah but the jump to spanish after learning english and french would n't be much greater . 
  he did n't say french was the most useful , just argued against the notion that it 's useless ( which is demonstrably false ) . 
   english is north american this is actually incorrect . 
  english was born in india , where it spread along the silk road to constantinople and was eventually exported to north america by the vikings . 
  my mistake !, 
  i never realised it was a language family , always thought they were dialects of the same language . 
  not only that , but a deal could still take a long time , and given it 's america they 're going to demand a lot of things which wo n't be popular in the uk . 
  are n't there hundreds of thousands of people with at least some knowledge of occitan ? 
  if so , that 's more than there are of scots gaelic . 
  nope . 
  cnut launched a fullscale invasion in 1050 . 
  i do n't think it 's relevant either , i was just pedantically questioning that one part of your post . 
  and i was talking more about cnut , who staged a full scale military attempt at conquest of england as king of denmark ( which i argue is not the same as simply raiding or ` going viking ' ) . 
  there is a distinction between lands that were settled by raiders and fullscale military action by a country . 
  your simply repeating that they were ` vikings ' as though denmark did n't exist as a political entity at that time does n't change that . 
  or i suppose there was no denmark , it was ` vikingia ' . 
  do you have a source on the death count for the opium wars ? 
  also genocide specifically refers to the intent to destroy a people ( as a group ) , not just to killing a lot of people . 
  britain was n't ruled by ` the vikings ' ( the word viking just refers to scandinavians who came to raid , there was no ` viking ' nationality or entity ) . 
  england was directly administered by the king of denmark and norway . 
  britain was n't just invaded by ` vikings ' , large parts of england were directly conquered by denmark ( under cnut ) . 
  pls no . 
  does n't greece still have [ blasphemy laws ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/10/20121013154342907568.html ) ? 
  which europeans ? 
  you 're welcome . 
  well yeah , have n't they been the most militarily successful european country in history ? 
  which led to the 100 years war . 
  these attacks from france came back to bite it on the arse . 
  i like the way you complain about people in this sub going on about brexit , yet feel the need to drag it up at every available opportunity . 
   why are atheists , secularists , agnostics or just religiously-unaffiliated people so underrepresented in politics ? 
  they 're not . 
  we just rarely mention beliefs in the uk because it 's seen as kind of weird , a bit off-putting , and no-one else 's business . 
  most people are agnostic but even talking about agnosticism or atheism would be seen as unnecessary . 
  bringing out the ` what about hillary ?! ', 
  card every single time someone criticizes trump does absolutely nothing to refute those criticisms . 
  he 's going to be president , at some point over the next four years he 's going to have to be held to account for what he does or does n't do , and the discourse is going to have to move on from ` but hillary ?! ', 
  ( though i should n't be optimistic ) . 
  ah i have n't spent much time on the asian side unfortunately . 
  i spent an afternoon in moda and that 's about it . 
  cihangir and beyoglu were my favourite parts . 
  that new metro tunnel under the bosphorus made me pretty uneasy , i have to say . 
  r/europe bingo . 
  yeah , but is it ** that ** roof top ? 
  by ` the eu ' do you mean the national governments that constitute it ? 
  so salty . 
  liguria is considered to be in the centre ? 
  weird . 
  there 's no point debating this guy tbh , you 're just giving him more opportunities to shitpost . 
   spain can be considered a transcontinental country too . 
  yeah but one is glorious and white and the other is mostly dirty muslims , duh . 
  well over 30 people were apparently . 
  oh man this makes me miss istanbul . 
  unlike enlightened unbiased r/ukpol , presumably . 
  striking down our red white and blue draconian surveillance measures !, 
  thanks eu for saving us from ourselves !, 
   it 's easier to put the cream on top of the jam than it is the other way round . 
  heresy . 
  it 's all just ` jam ' , we do n't make a distinction between the smooth kind and the chunky kind .

  how do you make your grilled cheese ? 
  we certainly do not toast our bread before making a grilled cheese sandwich . 
  we grill it . 
  hence the `` grilled cheese sandwich '' . 
  * cheese on toast * is a single slice of bread part-toasted , then topped with cheese and finished under a grill . 
  it 's not a sandwich , because there 's only one slice . 
  two bits of bread gets you a [ cheese toastie ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cheese+toastie&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=585&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjen7ixziprahxlkmakhcazamiq_auibigb ) , or a [ panini ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cheese+toastie&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=585&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjen7ixziprahxlkmakhcazamiq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=cheese+panini ) if you 're using a baguette or ciabatta . 
  til people in humberside are toffs . 
  the famous * langues de beurre * and * langues d'huile * linguistic divide . 
  yes , we did n't need a revolution quite like that in the 19th century because we 'd already ditched autocratic government . 
  anything else ? 
  so which glorious european cultures historically outshine us in the things you mentioned ? 
   i still dont understand why , i heavent heard a single good argument to leave welcome to my world . 
   but the ballot did n't just say start a50 or not , it was to leave or not to leave the eu . 
  the problem is that 's ** all ** it said , and the rest is open to interpretation , which is my point . 
   with that said i still fail to see how you 've misunderstood both the clear stated words of the leaders of both campaigns i have n't .
