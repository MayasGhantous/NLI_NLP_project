   it 's `` reputable '' because the vast majority of media is just as left wing as they are . 
  lol . 
  their editorial position does n't fit your politics , you mean ? 
   uk is not an empire anymore do we have to bring this up in every related thread ? 
  i do n't even think most leavers think that shit . 
  it 's not that our problems ca n't be solved , it 's that i do n't think they will be , at least in the near future . 
  i think the only avenue for real change in this country is if we get voting reform and maybe decentralisation of power from westminster . 
  i do n't dispute that , what i dispute is the idea of an anti-eu consensus within the uk that does n't exist . 
  that 's roughly the percentage of the uk 's population that voted to leave ( 17.4 million of 64 ) . 
  the thing that 's seriously wrong is almost everything . 
  brexit would n't be happening if this country were n't a mess . 
   i personally have seen an increase but that could just be my perception i 'm probably just so over-exposed i do n't notice . 
  27 % of us do n't . 
  if anything they 've calmed down since the vote . 
  i seem to see a lot less comments accusing people of being traitors to their country etc for supporting remain than i used to . 
   we say london is the 6th french city ( mayor boris johnson ) ... that 's some top trolling right there . 
   the term `` expat '' is colloquially used for the kind of person who moves somewhere for a job and who intends to go back to their country of origin when/if their employment ends or they just get bored . 
  i very rarely hear people extend this attitude to non-whites or eastern europeans in the uk . 
  they all get lumped together as ` immigrants ' . 
  london is a place higher than paris ? 
  that 's all i needed to know . 
  several thousand 20 something males acting like victims or circlejerking self-righteously over geopolitics on reddit are both equally tiresome and pathetic . 
  i needed the / s tag ? 
  this is a sad day . 
  no idea why . 
  dayum your comments are salty ( and lacking anything to back up your claims ) . 
  iirc the claim comes from an american think tank who looked at performance combined with cost . 
  the nhs was ranked highly for doing a good job on a tight budget . 
  even if that was true it 's probably less so now since the system is being starved by our government . 
  edit : [ source ] ( http://www.independent.co8.uk/news/uk/uks-healthcare-ranked-the-best-out-of-11-western-countries-with-us-coming-last-9542833.html ), 
  go to r/unitedkingdom for the exact opposite of that view . 
  according to the people in this sub , anyway . 
  the * english * are n't the only people in the uk , just a reminder . 
  i certainly would . 
  that would mean we 'd have to talk to piers morgan though , and none of us want that . 
  why keep paying 5p ( and inconvenience yourself ) when you can just bring your own bags ? 
  not convenient for the amount of rubbish that has to be cleared up from beaches and the like because people are too ignorant and lazy to throw their shit away properly . 
  i must have missed that part of the snooper 's charter . 
   even if your arm has been chopped off , the doctor will tell you it 's nothing and send you home with two paracetamols . 
  and i thought the uk was bad for this . 
  that 's not how the law works . 
   no , that 's only the case with ~ ~ queen victoria ~ ~ elizabeth i piracy ftw !, 
  i 'm still expecting the other miliband to try again at some point tbh . 
   without tourism that place would have no reason to exist anymore . 
  except for , you know , the people actually living there and its importance to the heritage of veneto . 
  you hipster . 
  i agree though , the east is amazing . 
  they are ? 
  shit , i was planning to visit the baltics next summer . 
  like [ cheddar man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheddar_man ) ? 
  lol . 
  yay !, 
  and now everything revolves around identity politics . 
   yes it does . 
  unfortunately . 
  we are seeing the rise of `` white identity '' politics which is completely hypocritical since the same people complained about identity politics . 
  so they just created their own brand of identity . 
  i do n't understand why people do n't see the irony in this ? 
  simultaneously lamenting race or gender politics etc then complaining that whites or men are neglected as a group . 
  the right complains about political correctness while whining about people hurting their feelings and calling them mean names in the media . 
  select trump . 
  media is confused . 
  occitania never forget . 
  1209 worst year . 
  yeah but edinburgh is even further from london , plus we can just expropriate the ready-made scottish assembly for the new parliament . 
  advantages +2 . 
  sounds like a reversion to eea for non-euro countries , rather than ` two speed ' . 
  seems like they 've been doing a good job considering they 've been dealing with this for more than a decade , along with a massive recession and little help from the eu until recently . 
  25 % * , just saying . 
  maybe the number 's deflated because languages are n't required subjects now in upper secondaries ? 
  i would maybe see if there are fb groups for estonians/eastern europeans/general migrants in the area you 're looking at and ask them their experiences . 
  imo as long as you 're not in the poorest/most working class parts you should be fine . 
   i fundamentally do not agree with the uk becoming part of a federal europe as i think it is bad for the uk 's democracy . 
  given this , leave was the only sensible option . 
  except we secured an opt-out on further integration . 
  this sub hates on a new country every other few months - it 's just our turn right now ( after greece , germany , sweden , and perpetually russia and turkey ) . 
  besides , hating on your neighbours is what being european is all about !, 
  did i mention russia ? 
  and what about afghanistan , iraq and libya ? 
  my country ( among others ) helped create the vacuum that has allowed groups like isis and al nusra to thrive . 
  it would be fine to say these things have nothing to do with us if european countries were n't partly responsible for exacerbating this mess . 
  if you want to control the refugee crisis maybe the eu should be lobbying against british and french interventionism or euro cooperation / arms deals with middle eastern states . 
  that 's pretty subjective to be fair . 
  when does something become ` historical ' for you , and what 's ` better ' ? 
  would you consider buildings like [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=neo+gothic+uk&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjb6jdz7anqahvromakhs6mbawq_auicsgc&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=607#tbm=isch&amp;q=hungarian+parliament+&amp;imgrc=fkiz8iitjgdatm%3a ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:sainte_chapelle_-_upper_level_1.jpg ) to be ` cookie-cutter trash ' ? 
  labour have a lot more problems than just corbyn , which is why they 've lost the last two elections . 
   zombies eat brains , and there is n't a single confirmed sighting of resurrected jesus munching on grey matter . 
  but can you prove zombie jesus * is n't * munching on peoples ' brains ? 
  this is why i find agnosticism to be the best approach regarding zombianity . 
  yeah , but how does that help me generalise about prides and lgbt people ? 
  except in scotland where most places are shut by bloody 11pm . 
   like i know few people that go to a butcher shop here and some buy directly from farm . 
  that 's good !, 
  we 're supposed to have high standards here but they 're not always carried out ( in terms of animal welfare etc ) , which i suppose is why cctv has been suggested . 
  most people i know want the animal on their plate to have at least been reared and killed humanely . 
  one told me once ( online ) that nazi racism towards slavs is all made up jewish propaganda and * mein kampf * has been ` misinterpreted ' . 
  beautiful . 
  why am i not surprised you turned a story about animal welfare into a way to criticise the uk ? 
  most meat eaters i know care about the quality of their meat and how it 's been reared though . 
   albania and bosnia case there are europeans because are on european continent .
