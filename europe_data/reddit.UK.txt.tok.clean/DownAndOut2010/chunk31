  so the part of turkey that lies in europe is european , using this argument . 
  therefore , we 're in agreement that turkey is partly european . 
  yep , and it 's a post i do n't have to take seriously , since you ca n't account for this :  what is european about that ? 
  ah ok , so you ** do n't ** think bosnia and albania can be european then ? 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  you said :  turkey is a muslim country . 
  what is european about that ? 
  bosnia and albania are predominantly muslim . 
  so according to the logic you applied to your post above , either muslim countries can be european , or albania and bosnia ca n't be . 
  which is it ? 
  til albania and bosnia are n't european . 
  they must be part of that little known subcontinent , bosbania . 
  yeah , that 's not some judgement of mine against croats . 
  there are plenty of idiots like that in the uk too . 
  we have good dental health , just not ( comparatively ) pretty teeth . 
  they 're going to polder doggerland back into existence ? 
  10 million turks live in eastern thrace , it 's a bit more than the tip ( at least in terms of population . 
  a local dude in mostar told me neonazis come over the border to vandalise things and write ` herzegovina is croatian ' everywhere . 
  ca n't say if this is true or not . 
  yeah ... 
  i was joking about your phrasing . 
  never mind . 
  which stats are you basing this on , anyway ? 
  do they take into account brexit and the ( possible ) decrease in net immigration ? 
   the uk is predicted to be the second largest country in europe by 2100 does climate change cause france and germany to flood , or is someone planning to invade mainland europe ? 
  not to mention that over the past milennium jews were treated better in muslim than in christian countries generally ( up until after wwii ) , you ca n't say all muslims are bound to be inherently antisemitic , since it 's just not true historically . 
  danelaw northern master race . 
  found the frenchman . 
   are people meant to never visit cities in foreign countries ever again ? 
  no no no , the idea is that we should be able to go wherever we want , but tourists should n't come to * our * city . 
   actually my family is german , i.e , you 're canadian . 
  so you would n't want young czech people to be able to backpack , and travel in europe to be the reserve of people with a lot of money ? 
  either way , it 's eu migration that was the hot button issue in the decade leading up to the referendum . 
  brexiteers were most pissed off about intra-eu migration , not extra-eu migration . 
  that 's not what i was talking about though . 
  people are talking about the ` new ' normalisation of terror , when my point is in the uk this is not new ( even if it largely vanished for a decade or so ) . 
  that does not mean i equate the ira with islamic terrorists , because i do n't . 
  you think it made a huge psychological difference to locals what the motives are when something near them explodes ? 
  also people at the time did n't know when ( or if ) the conflict would end . 
  in england though there tend to be overarching accent ` regions ' ( i 'm not as familiar with accent differences within the other countries in the islands ) . 
  so west midlands accents vary but you can tell if an accent is ` midlands ' . 
  but yeah , i get your point . 
  it 's possible i have n't heard 'em all . 
  reminded me of [ terry tibbs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsnqncw_wpc ) . 
  he has a ( non-standard rp ) south eastern english accent though , which most foreigners would n't learn unless they lived here to pick it up . 
  that makes me think he 's either just spent a long time here , or he 's from a diaspora community . 
  like the ira or italy during the lead years ? 
  yeah , people are talking about this like it 's new but it 's been part of the ` every day ' experience in the uk for a while , we just had a break for a few years . 
  so much so that it 's changed our urban environment without us realising : no rubbish bins in train stations ( because people used to put bombs in them ) , bollards in central london ( to try and discourage these kind of driving attacks ) . 
  it does have a twang to it yeah . 
  i 'd say he 's either a non-native speaker who 's extremely fluent , or a native speaker who 's spent a long time living in another country ( and speaking its language ) . 
  charming . 
  nah , it 's just that every one of the million or so central/eastern europeans that came after 2004 is a teen mum . 
  12 year old confirmed . 
  you 're saying increasing inequality is people not wanting to sort their ` boring lives ' out ? 
  boot straps bollocks !, 
   serious crime the uk deals with from lithuanian gangs . 
  ah , i did n't know this was a thing . 
  you 're on a roll today with the inane comments . 
   oh yeah , we ca n't find the faults in the shitty system itself so let 's find the fault with the voters the focus ** is n't ** on our shitty system though . 
  eu membership was an easy target but wo n't change much about many of the problems facing this country ( austerity , abandoned communities that suffer low investment , stagnant wages , inequality , london-centrism ) , simply because our governments have not given a shit . 
  the youth vote was [ around 65 % ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/09/young-people-referendum-turnout-brexit-twice-as-high ) , that 's only a few points below the national average . 
  even if more had voted we 'd still have been outvoted by older generations . 
  can this meme kindly die now ? 
   and why would you want to preform a homosexual act on a woman ?? 
  it 's not a ` homosexual act ' . 
  heterosexual people have anal sex . 
  did you not know this ? 
  are you 12 ? 
  you 're the one that keeps fixating on anal sex bruh , seems like you 're the one with the fetish . 
  oh , my lol was in agreement , not mockery . 
  whichever country you side with , this is a shitpost rather than something meant to provoke genuine discussion . 
  nah , both countries ( mostly ) escape attention here . 
  people generally do n't have anything bad to say about the baltic countries . 
  because i find men attractive , not because i have some weird fixation on butt sex ( which i could do with women anyway ) . 
  lol, 
  most of the major tourist attractions are in the old city , * sultan ahmet * , but my favourite part is the old greek/jewish/genoese area called beyo\u011flu . 
  on the other hand i 'll have plenty to laugh at  . 
  plus i 'll be campaigning for breturn in 20 years , so no worries . 
   not sure who you 're talking to there . 
  himself , empty space , his unhappy childhood etc. 
  whatever you say buddy . 
  i would n't , i voted remain . 
  but i 'd take eea membership ( or something close to it ) over anything brexiteers have to offer . 
   the leaders of the brexit campaign made it very clear - we 'd be leaving the single market . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/open-britain-video-single-market-nigel-farage-anna-soubry_uk_582ce0a0e4b09025ba310fce ) you people are making this shit up as you go along . 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dghdvvbtowm ah , the government that no one believed ( either on the benefits of eu membership or the consequences of brexit ) and called project fear ? 
  but you want me to accept that all leave voters totes believed in this * one * thing ? 
  suuuure . 
  except the brexit ` party ' included a massive diversity of opinion retroactively claiming the entire politics of leave can only match preferred vision of brexit is n't going to wash . 
  whatever you say buddy . 
  norway , iceland and switzerland participate in the single market but are not eu members . 
   the vote was to leave and to leave means leaving the single market and being in a position to join or form whatever trade agreement comes afterwords . 
  i did n't see any mention of the sm on the ballot paper - did i miss it ? 
  all this is your interpretation , and the gov is n't obligated to do anything more than remove us from the political union . 
  eu does not equal eea/efta ( i.e , single market membership ) . 
  brexiteers should know this , since one of their main arguments was the uk 's being in the eu was ` undemocratic ' since we voted to join an economic union in the 70s , not a political one . 
  a single market ` norway option ' has been part of the discourse surrounding brexit for ** years ** . 
  hardcore brexiteers do n't get to erase all this and pretend there was no diversity among leave voters just because they have a massive ideological erection for hard brexit . 
  should we end up with ` soft brexit ' ( and i sincerely hope we do ) , and brexiteers feel salty because they did n't entirely get their way , they can bugger off and whinge to ukip about it .
