  what people voted for : ` should the uk leave the eu ? ', 
  what they did n't vote for : any of that other stuff . 
  yeah , that one shitty pic with an upside down flag totes makes up for his shitting on trans rights and his homophobic staff . 
  you helped create them when you helped them gain independence , it 's all your fault . 
   never saw someone getting beat up/scream / bla bla bla ( in first world countries ) for being gay . 
  do n't presume to talk about things you know fuck all about . 
   and inherently the only difference in being gay to being straight is the engagement in butt sex , lol . 
  wow , you independently came to the realisation that turkey is transcontinental and lies within both europe and asia . 
  congratulations , your preschool teachers must be very proud . 
   bring forth thine crusaders to sack it once again then . 
  then we could at least get rid of some of the twats in our countries . 
  no it fucking does not . 
  there are loads of users on this sub using the flag of the country they 're living in and no one complains about them . 
  the person you replied to never said turkey was entirely in europe , and yet you felt the need to start banging on about asia . 
   alas , fell to muslim invaders from asia . 
  get over it . 
  ah well , i 'll be back soon !, 
  a drop in the tourist industry just means better prices for arseholes like me anyway . 
  plus i want to see cappadocia and the north . 
  you mean white gang members ? 
  it 's pretty much every thread that mentions turkey ever . 
  i 'm not turkish , and even i find it annoying . 
  istanbul is also probably my favourite city ( travelling as a tourist ) . 
  hoping to go back next year . 
  istanbul 's old city is geographically in europe . 
  if your struggles are n't related to your being straight , why do you need one ? 
  you did n't ` inherit ' the title , you took it . 
  you were n't forced to end isolationism after the war . 
  and like the us has been so peaceful ? 
   frankly , i think a lot of the people would like to go back to that time , and stop dicking around in every other country in the world . 
  fair enough , but while that 's not the case do not be surprised when other countries care about your business , because you make your business theirs . 
  is that struggle specifically based on your being straight ? 
  well i know no gay people who have no hobbies and whose lives entirely revolve around being gay . 
  that 's what happens when you make yourself the leader of the western world , yes . 
  and they all do that , do they ? 
  at every single pride ? 
  this is beautiful . 
  gb is a * witch * riding a pig . 
  we were n't united though were we , which is why the republic left . 
  now things are much better . 
   do what and what 's that ? 
   many how many ? 
   but i ca n't understand why i would attend a pride parade that features american politics while i 'm living in europe ( from my understanding almost everyone on the float is an american expat ) . 
  if you view trump ( or at least his party and administration ) as homophobic , which i 'd wager most lgbt people in western europe do , then trump is viewed as relevant to the conversation about gay rights . 
  especially since the us is so important , as i said in the other post . 
   genuine question : what 's the point of going to a pride parade then ? 
  gay rights advocation , self-affirmation in the face of personal struggle for being gay ( for those who still face challenges because of this ) , or a general mainstream party celebration tolerance and diversity/librul values etc. 
   but the women 's march was happening in places besides the uk ( although the majority of it outside of the us was in the anglo-sphere ) . 
  yep , i ca n't comment on other countries , only try and explain the context of the protests in the uk . 
  agreed . 
   i 'm obviously not an expert , but i 'm not a pilot and i can assure you planes do n't belong in the water this statement ( and your above posts ) suggest to me you 're ** not ** interested in having a genuine conversation , you 're looking for validation of your own pre-held beliefs concerning trans people . 
   is that why their suicide rate is so high ? 
  because they face so much shit for being trans ( which is `` bullshit '' according to your expert opinion ) . 
   that website is biased . 
  the american psychiatric association is biased ( and wrong apparently ) , opposed to famed reddit expert on all things trans u/drunkrabbit99 , who is totally unbiased . 
   what i 'm saying is that if you do n't care enough to look it up you do n't care enough to have this conversation so it 's unreasonable for me to ask for the evidence on which you 're basing your subjective opinion ( masquerading as objective fact ) ? 
   see if that changes anything to my life . 
  i dunno , you seem pretty invested in this issue to me . 
   yes but letting certain groups cherry pick where they like to serve is in fact a discrimination of the rest . 
  how is it `` cherry picking '' ? 
  if trump is concerned about trans people being in danger in afghanistan , he could 've banned them from being deployed to afghanistan - that 's clearly not what happened . 
   as a good rule of thumb , if you have a dick then you should n't be in the ladies restroom , no matter what . 
  gender does not equal sex . 
   3 ) is just plainly offtopic . 
  how is it ? 
  people in this thread are desperately reaching for any possible reason to bar trans people from serving , when they 've been serving in one of the world 's most advanced militaries for some time with none of these imagined problems apparently being a problem . 
  this happens in every thread relating to pride . 
   and you do n't need to ask me for sources , do your own research and you 'll know the truth , that 's not how this works . 
  you make a claim , you demonstrate on what that claim rests . 
   ok , because trans people serving in the military have been making the dod pay for their transitions while the dod ca n't afford prosthetic limbs for all the afghanistan and iraq veterans . 
  trump has n't banned people from having paid for transition surgery - he 's banned them from serving . 
  those are two separate issues . 
   because serving in the military is a privileged reserved for the fit and able minded , not a right . 
  the american psychiatric association [ does not consider ] ( http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx ) gender dysphoria to be a mental disorder . 
  seems like ** you ** are the one biased by your own ` ideology ' . 
  yeah but he held up that rainbow flag that one time you guys !, 
  1 ) where did i mention gay pride ? 
  i was specifically talking about a gay or homosexual identity , which is surely implicit in the notion of ` gay rights ' and the people who 've been campaigning for them for the last century ? 
  2 ) gay prides [ began ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gay_pride#historical_background ) as demos and marches for rights , not to make people ` love us ' . 
  and the people who actively dislike gay people just because of prides a couple of times a year probably are n't looking for an excuse to dislike us anyway . 
   i do n't expect people to care about the us 's internal situation the us makes its ` internal situation ' everyone else 's problem by virtue of its geopolitical position - you do n't get to be boss of the western world without people ` caring ' about who they 're going to have to deal with . 
  also , us politics affects the political conversation in the uk . 
  when people protested trump here , they were n't just talking about trump , they were talking about his politics and the people who share them here in the uk . 
  did he say r/europe was right-wing , or that he was ` persecuted ' ? 
  seems like you 're jumping the gun pal . 
  are each and every person at a pride saying their entire identity revolves around being gay and that 's the only thing that defines them ? 
  you 're strawmanning . 
   they are n't emotionally stable enough to be in the military . 
  then require them to get a psych assessment before enlisting . 
   if you look at the numbers , suicide is basically a privilege of the upper class . 
  rich people kill themselves more than poor people . 
  source ? 
   they are mentally ill and their behavior should be treated instead of rewarded . 
  all you 've shown me is your subjective opinion , nothing showing why trans people should n't serve in the military . 
   seems counterproductive . 
  actually it 's been very productive . 
  it 's helped us secure rights in the face of institutional homophobia in many countries , and continues to do so . 
  also we did n't even invent it as an identity , it was created ( along with ` heterosexuality ' ) by victorians who pathologised it as a disorder and used against people who had same sex attraction . 
  1 ) the entire american military is n't the forces serving in afghanistan . 
  2 ) trans people generally do n't want * separate * restrooms - they want to use the restrooms matching their gender .
