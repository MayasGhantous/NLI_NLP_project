  nah , london can be the world capital when we finally get the nwo one world government . 
  this comment 's going to go down well . 
  god help us all . 
  i should n't have tbh . 
  arguing with idiots on reddit is n't exactly covering myself in glory , but oh well . 
   we have greens and a tiny bit of yellow !, 
  unacceptable !, 
   :( seriously though , i also love cold and stormy weather . 
  i get why brits complain about the weather so much ( because it gives us an acceptable subject to talk to strangers about ) but i 've never been able to relate . 
   i do n't pay taxes you buy anything that 's not on the black market , you 're giving me your yummy , yummy taxes . 
  and for that i ( and the lifestyle you help fund ) thank you . 
  all the best . 
   my bets are on libertarians crushing statist minions . 
  lol . 
  capitalism ca n't exist without the state because capitalism relies on the state to enforce property as an institution . 
  luckily libertarianism ( in the recent american sense of the word , since it has a longer association with anti-capitalists going back to proudhon etc ) are a loony minority mainly confined to the states . 
  you 'll be doing no ` crushing ' , and i 'll never have to experience the bullshit of rothbard and his kind . 
  now , i do n't know which country you 're from , but if it 's the uk then thanks for the taxes . 
  i 'll use the money given to me by the government to supplement my uncompetitive university degree to buy a drink in your name  . 
  obviously we have different drinking cultures anyway ( so it 's hard to compare exactly ) , but i 'm surprised france and germany are n't far behind us . 
   so you 'd rather force poor people to subsidise your uncompetitive industries instead of letting them have a choice of cheaper products ? 
  we went through that ` competetive ' race to the bottom of giving free reign to business during the industrial revolution . 
  those protections had to be fought for for centuries to stop business from using child labour and to create things like the 8 hour work day . 
  we do n't need your free-market dystopia . 
   the world wo n't wait for your slow asses to adapt to the global economy . 
  please show me an example of a successful or growing economy that grants no protections to its citizens or does not mediate trade or economic forces in any way . 
   this is concept is recent in history . 
  when , in the last few thousand years , has trade not been mediated by state forces ? 
   free trade only requires states to get out of the way and let private entities conduct business and let the goods and services cross borders unlimited and unhampered . 
  i 'd rather we keep our employment , environmental and human rights protections tbh . 
  thanks all the same . 
   brit is also used in a demeaning context here often where is ` here ' ? 
  afaik ` brit ' as a term is n't associated with discrimination in the uk or us , whereas ` paki ' and ` jap ' * were * both used as insults in those countries . 
  not a french derived word , unfortunately . 
  overwhelming mandate of the +4 percent . 
  i like your style . 
  hush , fellow arms exporter to ksa . 
  good guy russia . 
  nice try , miscellaneous colonial british flair . 
   wan na join the efta i wish . 
  first we have to convince our crazy politicians to go for it ( with the brexiteers hardening their position against fom ) , then we have to somehow convince you lot to let us in . 
  is n't that because the cities are mixed though , whereas rural areas are majority catalan ? 
  does n't seem improbable that residents from the rest of spain would oppose catalonia breaking away . 
  to avoid the instability and division which brexit has caused . 
  a large majority would also be a lot less ambiguous than one of 1 or 2 % . 
  it was given to us by the greeks actually . 
  the uk is an enemy of europe ? 
  cool . 
  so anti-polish sentiment in the uk is justified based on their election of a right-wing government ? 
  they 're all responsible after all . 
  even though a minority of the population voted for brexit or the tories ? 
  and ignoring the horrendous reach of our media barons ( which this sub complains about constantly ) , and our unfair voting system ? 
  what a nice , uncomplicated way of looking at the world . 
  you missed ** paying ** and ** just ** :p . 
   but how should i judge it then ? 
  you form your own conclusions about our political climate and government , and then treat us individually as individuals and not polandball caricatures that can be reduced to a handfull of stereotypes ? 
   the individual is not responsible for the behavior of others . 
  seems like opinions like yours are becoming [ less vocal ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6jraet/brits_bogus_food_poisoning_claims_leave_hoteliers/ ) here these days . 
   im in no position to `` know better '' what the british population want than its own democratic elected government . 
  maybe you 're not qualified to judge a country of 65 million according to its government then , as though there 's no nuance to a country 's political context or it 's population ? 
  so your issue is n't xenophobia or racism , just xenophobia against europeans , which is qualitatively different from prejudice against non-europeans somehow ? 
  cool . 
  so which perfect euro country are you from , and how can i generalise about it in some way ? 
  i actually like the shard . 
  it 's r/evilbuildings excellence . 
  the walkie talkie on the other hand is gross . 
  well , the british state actively repressed the non-english languages ( and even dialects of english ) . 
  it took effort . 
  i thought he was taking the piss tbh . 
  now everyone 's upset . 
  agree to disagree . 
  how to annoy everyone from the uk no matter which home nation . 
  welcome to r/europe . 
   teacheses ? 
   i deny your right to call turkey a european country . 
  i do n't . 
  it 's transcontinental , meaning it 's european , asian and neither . 
  it 's entirely appropriate in this sub and you all need to get over yourselves . 
   i 've not noticed any impact besides when i 've been abroad or when i purchased my macbook ( as apple put the prices up ) . 
  however , the macbook that i sold in order to buy my new one also increased in value as a result . 
  that 's literally the only difference i 've noticed . 
  my macbook cost more than it would have a few months earlier in 2016 , and my budget travelling in europe this year went less far than it did last summer . 
   you 've treated this in the classical adversarial debate fashion : this is my position and i 'll argue it come what may . 
  how is he ? 
  he 's clearly said he does n't know for sure , this is just his working theory until he learns otherwise . 
  for now . 
  true . 
  bit rich coming from corbyn though , considering he 's voted against the party literally hundreds of times . 
  southern scotland was partially occupied by the romans , which is why there 's a [ second wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonine_wall ) just above edinburgh . 
  they did n't stay very long though . 
  * harry potter and the pseudo history . 
  no love for romansch ? 
  poor switzerland . 
   that 's a pretty silly way of looking at it since the greeks already had a great civilization when rome was merely a village . 
  especially since rome was directly influenced by greek civilisation . 
   that said , for reasons aesthetic and acoustic , i despise minarets . 
  i really like the classic ottoman mosques though . 
  they 're pretty imo . 
  that 's a fine-ass church too . 
  they can fuck off tbh .
