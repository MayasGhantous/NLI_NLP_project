  nope . 
  not under fptp . 
  even if the country turns against the tories , 10 years later frustration at labour and a pr makeover from the cons will make people swing back . 
  then an election or so later it goes back to labour , and so on and so on . 
   you want to ban hunting now too ? 
  and hunting does not require hand guns , which is why licensed hunting rifles are legal in the uk while hand guns etc are not . 
  have n't militants in iraq and afghanistan been fighting coalition and government forces with machine guns and ieds rather than hand guns ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the irish will agree that ireland was colonised by england/britain , and that was part of our ` territory ' for centuries . 
  i 'm not sure just because you make a conquered territory a part of your modern nation , that somehow removes all doubt as to whether the nation belongs there or its continuing ownership of said territory is entirely legitimate . 
  maybe the difference with nice is that it currently has no general wish to break away . 
  we can move the uk 's capital to letterkenny . 
  problem solved . 
  also because we 're scientifically proven to be the bravest and most lawful countries , so it makes sense really . 
  i 'm getting ` brave ' , ` outstanding person ' , ` hero ' , and ` flower ' for the * ying * in \u82f1\u56fd . 
  japan more or less does the same thing . 
  \u82f1\u8a9e - * eigo * , english language . 
  then when they want to refer to england specifically , you get \u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9 , * ingurando * . 
  haha i think it sounds better . 
  i do n't get the disapproval from some of you guys . 
  i 've never heard native english speakers use ` czech ' that way , but i have from actual czechs here in the uk , e.g `` i went back to czech for a week '' . 
  maybe now they 'll start using * czechia * as it becomes more recognised ( i know one czech dude who 's been using it for a while , but most will simply still say `` czech '' when they do n't want to add * republic * ) . 
  not to mention our dearest freedom loving friends , pinochet and suharto < 3 . 
  putting words in his mouth to make a lazy shady comment about brits ? 
  also because many of them still have their own colonial/oversees territories . 
  shrodinger 's empire . 
  uk/brexit related shitthreads or threads containing uk/brexit related shitposts have dominated this sub since june last year . 
  no , it is n't * every * thread , but it 's been a whole fucking lot . 
   then do n't click on the topics that are smug jokes . 
  but that 's pretty much every r/europe thread now . 
   then do n't click on the topics that are smug jokes . 
  but that 's pretty much every r/europe thread now . 
  hence his question as to why he bothers coming . 
  at least 5 times a day , for the foreseeable future !, 
  +1 heinz are watery in comparison , the sauce does n't taste as good , and you get a lot more dud beans than in branston cans . 
  amazing you 're getting downvoted for this . 
  edit : wow , and me too !, 
  salty bunch today , eh ? 
  how is this kind of reasoning getting upvoted when this sub frequently and loudly denounces the same kind of rhetoric from the likes of ukip ? 
  if it 's ok for an industry to discriminate against brits in general because of the actions of a few , then why is the leave campaign 's ` they took er jerb ! ', 
  reasoning not also permissible ? 
  worked too . 
  and he killed many of the ones that were deemed too * slavic * and not aryan enough . 
  that 's all well and good , but how can we use this information to make the uk look bad ? 
  we 've got submarines . 
  the point of the carrier is facilitating aircraft sorties . 
  when it ceded from eurasia after the eurexit . 
  is n't france the obvious ` top dog ' ? 
  i 've become so jaded with everything over the last year i 'd largely stopped feeling angry about brexit , but reading comments like his just riles me up again . 
  was n't that always the case ? 
  english nationalism has always been seen as bad ( as opposed to british nationalism , which has different associations ) , even by people in england . 
   still , that 's quite a vast generalisation when talking about 60 + million people . 
  yeah but we 're in this sub so it 's fine . 
  russia and belarus were originally conquered and settled by the welsh in 1250 ad . 
  the impact the welsh left on the local languages can be felt to this day . 
  erm ... they 're already there ? 
  this is largely brits who have been resident abroad for enough time to meet the requirements of citizenship . 
  or ... you could use precise language without resorting to hyperbolic and demonstrably false terms such as ` exodus ' to fit your narrative ? 
  oh i do . 
  i 'm just becoming extra salty about it ( and i 'm a fucking remainer ) . 
  the results have been ... mixed :p, 
   but why are uk meps voting even when they know they 're leaving ? 
  well , the uk is still putting money into the eu and is still a full member so it 's only fair that they get to vote on any matters . 
  we should n't have any say on measures that will affect the eu beyond the 2019 withdrawal deadline tbh . 
  do russia and turkey have economic ties with western european countries to the extent that the uk does ? 
   british and french military intervention never touched a hair on saa 's head . 
  yes , because our parliament ** rejected ** it . 
  i 'm not commenting on the pros and cons of scottish indy ( which i support if scots want it ) . 
  i 'm pointing out the hypocrisy of arguments here against emotional voting , which is damning for the uk but laudable for scotland . 
   there is going to be a shitload of those . 
  you need to change that sentence from future to past and present tense . 
  i 've heard almost nothing else from this sub since the referendum . 
   the new kurdish state . 
  that would be great , but wo n't turkey attempt to prevent it ? 
   nobody came to dethrone assad , though . 
  yes , because britain and france rejected increased military intervention . 
  not to mention our support for the ` moderate rebels ' which has exacerbated the conflict . 
  unless we 're talking about scotland ? 
  i seriously doubt this sub 's morbid obsession with every facet of brexit is for the benefit of leavers . 
  maybe ` we told ourselves so ' would be more apt . 
  i look forward to a thread that points out each and every 100 jobs lost . 
  acquaintance with french culture has pretty much always been an ideal of england 's / britain 's elites . 
  charles has been [ relatively outspoken ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/21/prince-charles-putin-hitler-comparison-latest-string-gaffes ) at times , or at least not careful with his opinions . 
   i live in canada america 's fancy hat ? 
   she will die at some point . 
  source ? 
  i 'd vote for empire in space , tbf . 
  so the french are perfidious too , eh ? 
   `` fixed '' the irish one ... 
  reminds me of the basque flag . 
  yet . 
  the mail article that mentions it has some angry comments , apparently . 
  and if even a few mail readers have been irritated , i 'll sleep a little better tonight . 
   omg dude it had no impact . 
  who the fuck says it did ? 
  all i said was it would have been slightly easier for gays without state as well as societal persecution . 
  you 're arguing about nothing . 
   the ottoman empire had an anti gay background too ( spoiler : shakira law ) by then so the law did not change anyones lives . 
  everyone had an anti-gay agenda then , because it was the fucking ** 19th century ** . 
  the admirable thing is that despite ` shakira law ' and 19th century homophobia , the ottomans displayed enough secularism to decriminalise a century before many western nations did . 
  anyway , based on your angry rants throughout the entire thread i 'm just going to assume you 're not willing to concede points that are n't anti-islam or anti-turkey , so there 's nothing more to be gained here .
