  i really do n't see why some countries ( particularly in the east ) would consent to this though if we move to deny the same rights to their own citizens . 
  we 're negotiating with 27 countries though , not just germany . 
  many countries are not going to vote our way when it comes to issues like immigration . 
  have an upvote on behalf of my childhood . 
  i 'm pro-eu , but the uk always gets what it wants ? 
  lol, 
   i do not mind the alliance , i embrace it , i love the anglo nations but i hate the american government , talks about friendship and then throws it 's ally under the bus for it 's own gains . 
  [ ... ] because we are small and no longer an empire we are not treated equally or with the respect we deserve from our ally . 
  the us is the bigger/biggest player - they 're going to act according to their own interests and agenda above everything else . 
  it 's how we acted for two centuries while we were able to get away with it . 
  funnily enough your complaint is one eu countries make against us . 
   america needs to keep it 's nose out of our business you know this is the lynchpin of our foreign policy , right ? 
  it 's not a one-way relationship . 
  america not caring about our business is probably the last thing westminster wants . 
  yeah , but how does that translate into influence within the eu ( especially when we 're trying to distance ourselves politically ) ? 
  globally we 're matched by france , and within the eu we have less clout than germany . 
  we can sabotage treaties/negotiations/bills etc. 
  that do n't align with our interests , and lobby for things that do , but it 's not like we 're in a position to bully the union . 
   there 's been constant warfare in the middle east since the beginning of recorded history so , like everywhere on the planet then ? 
   so it 's hard to say for sure if anyone is really responsible . 
  yes , things mysteriously got much worse after we funded al qaeda/mujahideen , and brought down multiple governments creating the power vacuums that allowed groups like isis , al nusra etc to spread . 
  but you 're right , it 's too difficult to say . 
  lack of a strong stance on ukraine equals no foreign policy apparently . 
  you know , because ukraine = the world . 
  i think there 's often a difference in perception of nationalism between countries/groups that were historically ` oppressed ' and those who are seen to have done the oppressing . 
  nationalism in scotland , ireland and wales for example is often seen as * resistance * , and part of the struggle to maintain culture and language . 
  in england it 's associated with racism . 
   like that piigs thing . 
  arrogance and ( near ) racism towards the south is hardly specific to the uk among northern countries , let 's be real here . 
  i 'm confident my government can get us a new deal that 'll return our freedom to poison our agricultural products . 
  i though our continent was burning to the ground media in the us and uk have been periodically saying this since waaaay before the refugee crisis . 
   a good chunk of your current laws . 
  which laws would those be ? 
  obviously . 
  but in the uk that 's been the case now for 300 years . 
  so what ? 
  are you from the uk ? 
  if so , can i ask why you think the ` extreme left ' are even relevant ? 
  they 're not the ones with any clout . 
  no one in this country left of labour is taken seriously ( outside of guardian editorials ) . 
  the uk 's biggest far-left political organisation , the socialist workers party , has a grand total of zero mps and a tiny membership . 
  or do you consider angry comments on twitter to be representative of some far-left hegemony ? 
  i 've been part of ** genuine ** ` extreme left ' circles , and there are n't as many of us as you seem to think . 
  * nuance * ? 
  in a thread about islam ? 
   we 've had islam in europe already , some 800 years ago the balkans are a thing , mate . 
   one day creadit card will run out ... 
  the uk has been in debt now for [ three centuries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_british_national_debt ) . 
   if all of it technically was palestinian land then there should have been a palestinian state there . 
  it was n't a state because it was a colonial possession ? 
  should the uk have a claim on it because it was briefly a part of the empire after we nicked it from the ottomans ? 
  yeah , and you made yourselves strong by annexing half a continent ( populated with people even less able to compete than those ` yokels ' ) and by fuelling your economy with slavery . 
  the situations are n't comparable . 
   happy because it means we get to leave the eu pretty clear what i was responding to ( you know , for people who can read ) . 
  and i 'd rather be in the eu than be left alone with the criminals who run this country . 
  see you voting day !, 
  speak for yourself brah . 
  plenty of us will be voting to stay . 
  you do n't have to apply moral relativism to hitler to prove that stalin and mao were tyrannical murderers . 
  they 've taken back the majority of latakia and are moving in on the supply lines with turkey ( cutting off the turkmens ) . 
  meanwhile they can leave isis to allied bombing . 
  does the us ** want ** a unified europe projecting itself with a centralized military though ? 
  gib tax monies please . 
  i , for one welcome our glorious szlachta plumber overlords . 
   it may be democracy but it certainly is n't nice democracy , using the eu 's power to shut down and push fear onto democratic groups . 
  so self-interest is only valid when we do it ? 
  its monarchy inherited the english crown in 1603 , and a century later the scottish parliament ( secretly ) voted to unify with england creating the uk . 
   the various operators are exactly that : they are contracted by the government to operate train services . 
  they do n't own the infrastructure , they just have a licence to use it . 
  come on , you know op means the franchises . 
  we pay for the infrastructure , x company gets the profit for ( shit and ludicrously overpriced ) service . 
  i thought you were talking about the uk ? 
  it 's not the ` english ' that kept french supremacy down for over two centuries  . 
   based on personal satisfaction of seeing uk go down in the trash of history . 
  there 's that famous eu solidarity . 
   actually , there is very strong support in the uk for membership of the eu as a free trade area . 
  so the eec then , rather than the eu ? 
   was n't cheddar man found to contain european dna ? 
  so the eu has been forcing us to take migrants for 9,000 years ? 
  britain 's oldest corpse ( cheddar man ) had dna extracted and matched to living residents of cheddar gorge in the 90s . 
  that 's 9,000 years of population continuity . 
  more and more of these studies are showing that the population ( of what is now england ) has largely remained stable . 
  anglo-wipeout theory is bollocks . 
  the point is that they might not necessarily have seen themselves as ` celtic ' , or as having a shared identity with other celtic groups . 
  ` celtic ' is a term they did n't come up with and which we projected on to the past based on linguistic groupings . 
  take that , celtic/anglo-saxon nationalists !, 
  you make france sound like some sort of underdog . 
  there were many points during the last thousand years when they were more powerful than we ( the english ) were , and they were always close behind as competitors in the colonialism game . 
   the uk is pretty much on its own though is it ? 
  are n't denmark and the vysegrad group also eurosceptic ( to varying degrees ? ) . 
  the uk 's mistake is trying to distance itself from eu politics rather than using its influence as part of a counter-bloc ( i.e , ` second-tier europe ' ) within the union . 
  do you have any sources for that ? 
  country starved of trade and products for years buys things . 
  that 's some crazy shit right there . 
  the deals have probably been in the works for months . 
   they do publicly hang gay people knowing people like me are executed in iran for who they have sexy time with is horrifying , yes . 
  that said , hopefully bringing them in from the cold will strengthen the moderates and give greater chance for eventual reform . 
  croat-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  was it ? 
  people used to complain about poles coming to the uk ( nickin ' our jobs etc ) , but i do n't remember the media having much to say about the actual polish state and it 's foreign/domestic policies .
