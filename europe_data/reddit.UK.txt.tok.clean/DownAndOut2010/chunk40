  they 're anglophone in spirit < 3, 
  would probably be more productive than trying to get sense out of our lot tbh . 
  not with that attitude he ca n't . 
  a tidal wave of brits !, 
  well it works i guess , so why not ? 
  1 ) why are you aiming this argument at me ? 
  where do you see me arguing macedonians should n't be called macedonian ? 
  2 ) i was responding to your incorrect statement that :  the britons in britain are n't related to the ancient britons which is false , in the case of a ) the welsh and cornish linguistically , and b ) the majority of the island genetically , as i said in my post . 
  if you meant something different in your original comment , at least admit that you were n't clear about what you meant , instead of moving the goal posts to imply i 'm wrong and banging on about the english culture and language . 
  being ` related ' does not mean ` the same as ' , which you seem to be implying . 
  3 )  how many celtic words does the english language usually use ? 
  now , how many germanic words ? 
  i 'm sure you have some ancient briton blood , but ancient briton culture was destroyed . 
  the english are not the inheritors of the ancient britons , and not even the inheritors of the romano-british . 
  that 's nice , but where did i say anything about english language and culture being related to the britons ? 
  4 )  sure , some celtic stuff survives , but some celtic stuff surviving is n't quite the same as a direct link . 
  you 're absolutely right that wales ( and scotland , ireleland and brittany ) retain links , but england sure as hell does n't . 
  so no one on the island has direct links , yet the welsh do ? 
  make up your damn mind . 
  and two languages that directly descend from the britons ' language is more than just ` stuff ' , and is most definitely the same as a `` direct link '' . 
   there 's always some mad torry/brexiteer lurking around waiting for a post like this to absolutely smear themselves with shit and blame eu/others for it . 
  plenty to come from the rest of this sub tbf whenever an inflammatory topic comes up . 
  we had a referendum on leaving the eu , and on ** nothing else ** . 
  anything beyond that is open to interpretation . 
  lol at your downvotes . 
  well done for attempting civility anyway . 
  yanks getting on the r/europe brexit karma train too now , eh ? 
  i do ? 
  i also occasionally watch john oliver as easy entertainment that occasionally tells me something i did n't know . 
  i propose fyromia . 
  the welsh and cornish are the only ones descend linguistically and arguably , culturally from the britons . 
  most of us are descended genetically from them though . 
   just like the britons in britain are n't related to the ancient britons that 's not true at all . 
  the majority of the people on the island have some genetic relation to the ancient britons , and in the case of wales they speak a language directly descended from the britons ' language ( with cornish , another brythonic language also being slowly revived in cornwall ) . 
  because some of them are worried macedonian nationalists will later have designs on ` greater macedonia ' . 
  i watch it for his analysis of and commentary on news rather than his jokes . 
   i do n't go around telling turks that istanbul should be called byzantium or constantinople . 
  you do n't ? 
  then you do n't r/europe correctly . 
  we ignore them like we usually do , of course . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  i interpreted the post you 're replying to as an attempt at explaining some of the attitudes that drove brexit among voters , rather than being his own opinion . 
   you mentioned thatcher yourself , and the leaders that shaped the eu so far , from mitterand and kohl , to merkel , sarkozy , prodi , etc have all been decidedly more opposed to the total privatisation of the economy she championed and distant from her views . 
  even blair , as you so aptly pointed out , was in a way a pupil of thatcher , only with a bit more welfare spending , but still not addressing the inequalities of the system . 
  i agree with you that the problem has always been our own , but what kind of change can ordinary people achieve when they have two , maybe three choices of parties to vote for , and they all deliver the same thing for decades ? 
  add to this the efforts by successive governments to use the eu as a scapegoat , years of slander from the media , and anger in communities that have been left to rot now for generations , and this is where we end up . 
  they did n't engineer it though , as a poorly thought out grab for power . 
   they cleverly neglected to add that they really meant control by and for the elite . 
  one of the things that 's irritated me most about brexit . 
  many poles speak english now though , so maybe it 's our time to shine in gdansk ? 
  tory/dup/law and justice coalition here we come !, 
   west should take notes . 
  too late . 
  that 's why i said ` it 's possible ' . 
  but yeah , what a mess . 
  if worse comes to worse it 's possible they could just rescind article 50 . 
  i 'm sure they 'd rather see us plummet off a cliff with no resolution with the 27 though . 
  of course he 's not worse than pinochet . 
  definitely belongs to the ` asshole ' category you mentioned though . 
  and soon she 'll have the indignity of hosting trump , who cheered when nude pics of her granddaughter-in-law were released . 
   i 'm sure people whose kid was there did their research , examined a statistically sufficient sample of pride parades , because not everyone goes to pride events expecting the worst of lgbt people like you do ? 
   seeing how this boy is visibly neglected/abused how ? 
  by being around gay people ? 
  shocking : o  but they are fine with extremists existing , seeing how they are never chased away from parades for their indecency . 
  again , so you can speak for all lgbt people and every pride ? 
  since your posts are repeating the same spurious claims backed by nothing but your own generalisations i 'll stop this here . 
  cheers , and see you at pride !, 
   should this one be expected to be any different ? 
  what kind of evidence are you basing these claims on ? 
   not even mentioning completely deranged people like bugchasers and who knows what else . 
  your using an extreme minority of wackos in the lgbt community to characterise the whole bunch ( and derail the topic about issues of human and civil rights ) suggests to me your priorities are out of order . 
  beyond the last 10 years , when has british politics been crazier than the euro average ? 
  well you 're making an awful lot of ` clairvoyant ' assumptions about what went on at zagreb pride . 
  and thanks for the downvote < 3 . 
  but labour support brexit and have ruled out a 2nd referendum ? 
  you 've been to every gay pride ever ? 
  that 's dedication to the lgbt cause , congrats !, 
  also , came to thread expecting comments bitching about pride - was not disappointed . 
  yes , everything is complicated . 
  who knew ? 
  r/europe shook from discovering shitty politics exist in the non-english parts of the uk . 
  not wanting to explode people but try peace negotiations means he likes terrorists , duh . 
  i did n't say it was a key factor in brexit , but it was definitely used by ukip and the leave campaign as a way of portraying the eu as tyrannical . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=brexit+greece&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=xhq4wcpgmsgt8qe2zl04#q=ukip+greece ) a few cursory examples for you . 
   i reheheheally doubt leavers cared much about the eurozone . 
  they do n't have to `` care '' about the eurozone - what they care about is making the eu look like a union of bullies ( among other things ) , and greece and the ` piigs ' crisis was used as part of that narrative . 
  edit : do n't understand why this got downvoted ? 
  you salty bunch . 
  yes , because she 's been positively covering herself in glory in the run up to eu talks . 
  perceived incompetence is also not good for negotiations . 
  lol really ? 
  seems like she 's been tripping ** a lot ** in the past few months . 
  yes because may is a master negotiator who is universally respected and will win us an amazing deal . 
  i dunno ... the perceived bad treatment of greece by the eu helped drive brexit in the uk , because it makes the union look adversarial and unfair . 
  are n't they all the same thing ? 
  also parties in scotland . 
  we do n't shit on everyone in r/uk ... just tories . 
  shittiest meme on reddit . 
  the thread about the ` spirit of london ' photo of the guy with the pint , featuring multiple comments that found a way to make the ` resilience ' negative . 
  yes please .
