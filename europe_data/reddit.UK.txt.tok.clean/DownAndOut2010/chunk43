   a cynical , emotionless , slightly homo-erotic , corporate copy of justin timberlake . 
  that 's hot, 
  for the greater good . 
  r/alleu , also known as r/europe . 
  so we lose tariff-free trade with our neighbours and most important trade partners and plug the hole with what ? 
  what 's the rest of the world going to want from us that 's that substantial ? 
  jam and cornish pasties ? 
  by ` some of the uk subs ' do you mean r/ukpolitics ? 
  given our main sub is overwhelmingly anti-brexit i ca n't imagine they would have disagreed with you . 
  well earth ** is ** full of foreigners . 
  only sensible thing to do in these circumstances , really . 
  removing tariffs ... like we did in a certain union we 've been in for decades you mean ? 
  brexiteers are delusional i swear . 
  how many times does he have to say he 's fucking 17 ? 
  god you 're bitter . 
  oh bugger off . 
  he 's not responsible for what his government does . 
  ah yes , as a remainer i get to choose between the tories and labour who both support ( hard ) brexit . 
  such options available to me !, 
  not if they 're openly gay fencing karma points . 
  this guy knows how to r/europe . 
  nope , not since the 13th century, 
  at my count there were at least 10 threads yesterday relating to the uk or brexit . 
  in the threads * not * relating to the uk or brexit , people often bring them up anyway . 
   welcome to the outgroup . 
  how many times are you going to post about this ? 
  you 're obsessed . 
  edit : and now we have eugenics too ? 
  ok , no more time for you . 
  70 % threads about brexit/uk , 20 % europe stronk , 10 % everything else . 
   then why are you writing a comment about a topic you do not know much about ? 
  welcome to reddit/social media . 
  i think their better half would be germany now , but we love-hate them even if they do n't love-hate us < 3 . 
  low effort shit-post . 
  that 's a minimalist breakfast ? 
  what 's your idea of a filling breakfast then ? 
  r/europe does enough foaming without the brexiteers . 
  the queen , duh . 
  then the * real * negotiations/mma fight begins . 
  same . 
  it 's from silt afaik . 
  i sometimes wonder if fantasizing over hell was the pre-modern version of torture porn . 
  you know ukip 's been around much longer than the last year , right ? 
  even in the last election , before the tories embraced brexit , they did not do as well as fn has . 
  glad the ( much , much ) worse candidate did n't win ? 
  hell yeah i am  . 
  eh , we were n't very smart in the first thousand years so you win that one . 
  appreciate it !, 
  i 'm a remainer actually , sorry to disappoint . 
  ok , so by ` followed all their policies ' you just meant brexit . 
  thought so . 
  ok , besides brexit which policies are they following ? 
  luckily most anglos ( speaking as an anglo ) ca n't speak other languages so the poison 's harder to spread . 
  that is glorious . 
  have they ? 
  beyond exiting the eu , can you tell me which ones ? 
  lost what ? 
  because brexit was driven by resentment towards eu migration , not brown people ( although there were definitely elements of that ) . 
  the tories are appalling , but not comparable to fn . 
  haha . 
  brexit may have been a shitshow , but at least our crazy party did n't get to 2nd place in elections . 
  oh this bullshit again . 
  did he at least manage to sell you a paper ? 
  anti-fa is not a monolith . 
  literally anyone who opposes fascism can call themselves antifa . 
  reddit , where opposing nazism makes * you * the fascist . 
  i 'm not ` hating ' , of course not everyone hates her . 
  i think that massively depends on which part of the country you 're from though . 
   and for all the people here who seem to think they can speak on behalf of entire geographical regions of people . 
  get a fucking grip , you do n't . 
  likewise , it 's wrong to pretend that everyone * does * like her . 
  tell that to people in northern england or scotland . 
  same . 
  i encourage more people to have a go . 
  obligatory embarassing comment from fellow brit . 
  edl imploded a while ago ( with the sdl still having a small presence in scotland ) . 
  britain first is really the only active one and they seem to have slowed down . 
  yes !, 
  there was so much included i did n't manage to see it all in a week . 
  and ephesus is firmly at the top of things i really want to see ( as is more of turkey in general ) . 
  and part of the istanbul museum pass !, 
  which is fucking amazing value ( about 20 euros when i was there last year ) . 
  any western european city would charge that for hagia sofia alone . 
  basically no one likes them . 
  you wish :p, 
  very serenessima , much wow . 
  yeah , i guess op should have made the distinction ( though possibly that 's what they meant ) . 
  well at least that would get us a bit further than ` but the gays * i * know say xyz ! ', 
  edit : i did n't downvote btw . 
  he 's just a troll . 
  stop wasting your time . 
  well , for a start there are diffetent types of nationalism , and there 's a difference between ` pride ' ( whatever you think of this ) and chauvanism . 
  thanks for this . 
  lol really ? 
  100 % of all the queer or trans people you know support trump ? 
  the muslim presence in the us is tiny . 
  the vast majority of lgbt folks in the us are under threat from non-muslim americans ( like the trans people who get killed every year ) , rather than this small minority . 
  as a gay person , i know there are ** some ** people who share the opinions you talk about , but i 'm willing to bet if you ask r/lgbt or r/gay what they 're more concerned about , trump and the republicans will top islam . 
  how much is ' a lot ' ? 
  is there much to see ?
