  #breturn 2040, 
   my little insult is nothing compared to the wave of vitriol towards brexiters from bitter remainers after their defeat . 
  you can look forward to that for a few more years yet . 
  i finally found a non-liberal irishman . 
  one of us !, 
  one of us !, 
  i would love this ( and be willing to pay for it ) , but i ca n't see why the 27 members would agree . 
  they should make people take lie-detector tests and only offer it to remain voters ... 
  i 've passed that bookshop dozens of times and never knew it had this . 
  i see it more as a certain section of english/british society is hostile towards the rest of the uk . 
  areas like cornwall , humberside and north east england are n't really doing well out of the bargain . 
  nah , the us would n't want us as a state , because we 'd get disproportionate representation and tip their politics towards the left ( which is saying something ) . 
  both . 
  not every russian or turk voted for putin , or erdogan . 
  so no . 
   is n't it normal to show negativity towards people that you do n't like so they have a cause to change ? 
  does that actually work ? 
  or does that attitude just play into the hands of dictators who can then say `` why should we want to follow them ? 
  they hate you '' . 
  you can discuss ( and be critical of ) countries and their shitty governments without dehumanising millions of people . 
  i do like this sub , but i do n't really see the narrow , generalised way people here tend to view russia , turkey etc as civilised . 
  what the ... ? 
  if the peeps in that photo ** are ** anarchists , that 's some pretty wack anarchism . 
  anarcho-communism is generally explicitly critical of nation-states , ( even the ones the left likes like palestine and ireland ) . 
  anti-fa does n't necessarily mean anarchist , mind you . 
  anarchists want the end of nation-states in general , it 's not that they single germany and its culture out for special treatment . 
  i , for one welcome our pierogi overlords . 
  i 'm agreeing with you :p . it 's rather arbitrary . 
  for brexit , yes . 
  not for what shape brexit would take, 
  historical convention + vague notion of shared cultural heritage = europe . 
  the arse-end of eurasia . 
  zealand . 
  it 's because the russians who have n't already left the sub are masochists . 
  it 's not sudden . 
  this sub has been anti-russian for a long time . 
  maybe in this map the isles are ruled from dublin . 
  make britain france again . 
  it 's weird that she still has to be attached to any discussion surrounding his merits ( or lack of ) though . 
  fair enough . 
  politics is a mess . 
  i wonder if i 'll ever live to see the day when people can respond to criticism of trump without whatabouting hillary or the dems . 
  imo it does . 
  islam has had a presence in europe longer than some countries have been christian . 
  that 's a damn sexy residential street . 
  interesting idea !, 
  op says you 'll be conquering/fighting against the entire continent though , rather than targeting specific countries . 
  so for the sake of the thought experiment i 'm unilaterally saying we 're against you :p . 
  i disagree . 
  i would n't overstate our willingness to follow the us into war , especially one against europe . 
  it would depend massively on the reasons for doing so . 
   edit : besides , who are you kidding ? 
  you 'd be with the invaders . 
  in the context of the us invading all of europe i think that would be a hard sell to the british population . 
  the only thing that might sway us is the threat of absolute annihilation if we fought against the us . 
  uk - edinburgh europe - prague or venice . 
  underrated gem . 
  not really . 
  there are 55 or so million people in england ( even split into 4 different regions , each part would have a population greater than wales , scotland and ni combined ) , yet administration is massively concentrated in london . 
  with proper federalisation , english people who 've historically complained about neglect from south-east england could have greater autonomy and control over expenditure that better reflected local needs . 
  problem is english people do n't seem to want it ( or believe it could be an option ) , while the complaints about london-centrism continue . 
  hmmm let 's test your theory : french cuisine is better than british cuisine . 
   another quarrel is whether you call it ~ ~ `` pain au chocolat '' ~ ~ `` chocolatine '' or are a uneducated savage . 
  i 've got friends from each of the four countries of the uk except wales ( if people i know at uni are welsh , they 're the kind with englishy accents from the borders so i ca n't tell ) . 
  do n't think i 've ever met anyone from the channel islands , nor any of the crown dependencies or oversees territories . 
  also do n't think i 've ever met any roma . 
  i remember the wiki on occitan says hundreds of thousands still speak it , but it 's mostly older people ( i do n't know if this is true ) . 
  native : english upper intermediate/b2-ish : italian a2-b1 : spanish and thanks to italian and a bit of studying in the past i can usually understand written french ( for the most part ) , and can speak it basically . 
  oooh you mean they should n't be asking their teacher how she is ? 
  i 'm slow today . 
  black friday is the absolute worst and needs to die . 
  what should they be saying ? 
  well , sturgeon will campaign for a referendum on whether scotland should float about in the north sea or drift off to the atlantic ( or into space ) with england and wales . 
  so we 'll have to wait and see . 
  or if we manage to get a soft brexit , we might flow out into the atlantic and then wash back up near the dutch coast every day in a kind of tidal fashion . 
  i 'd really love to go to norway but holy crap the prices . 
  i thought the industry at bar and kotor was already very developed ? 
  they do n't need the whole country to be amazing , just a few nice towns and cities for cruise ships to invade . 
  england and wales * . 
  they 're not getting out of this squeaky clean . 
   well obviously life started in the south but it was too damn hot so many left and headed north for the vast majority of human civilisation ( starting with sumeria ) , the richest most advanced countries and territories were in the south . 
  see : sumeria , egypt , the hittites , mittani , kush , china , india , persia , babylon , assyria , carthage , the olmecs etc. 
  we have parts of europe that could be included ( crete , the myceneans , the greeks , rome , and then the parts of europe rome ` civilised ' ) , and maybe japan and korea , but the total global shift in wealth and development did n't happen until the last milennium . 
  my surname appears in english records from the 13th century and is either old english or anglo-norman . 
  most indigenous brits share ancestry with the people who moved here after the last ice age , so i assume i 'm no different in that regard . 
  lol at your down vote . 
  more seriously : we do n't have a lot of dangerous insects , and most big predators were wiped out . 
  we 've reintroduced boars though , and are planning possible reintroductions of lynx and maybe wolves . 
  i met the guys from * a tribe called red * when they came to talk at my uni about native music and politics . 
  my impression ... hard to generalise since there are multiple nations in the us alone , but the natives seem like interesting and unique cultures that have had a very bad deal since contact with europeans . 
  i do n't really know much about natives today , apart from the stuff that went down with * idle no more , * and a few artists and works like * a tribe called red , the 1491s , smoke signals * and the writer n. scott momaday . 
   we were austria 's bitch satellite . 
  as far as i know , bohemia was then the designated industrial region , so while not being very poor , people have been complaining about being in austria-hungary for dozens of years at that point and wanted their own country where german did not have to be spoken . 
  iirc bohemia was the most developed part of the empire though , no ? 
  stephen hawking and [ will self ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/will_self ) are the closest to that i can think of . 
  otherwise peeps like [ alain de botton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alain_de_botton ) ( i guess ) , [ simon schama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simon_schama ) ( historian ) , richard dawkins , peter higgs , [ george monbiot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_monbiot ) ( political and environmental writer and activist ) , [ eric hobsbawm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eric_hobsbawm ) ( marxist historian ) , [ niall ferguson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niall_ferguson ) ( a very * un * - marxist historian ) , [ mary beard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mary_beard_ ( classicist ) ( classicist and lit critic ) ... would 've added [ stuart hall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stuart_hall_ ( cultural_theorist ) ( cultural theorist ) and [ john berger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_berger ) ( art critic ) but they both passed recently . 
   annoyingly , many people actually believe that the uk already has some kind of authority over the other commonwealth realms like canada and australia - which is obviously not true . 
  do you have some source for this ? 
  i see/hear righties saying they 'd prefer closer * links * with the other anglo countries , but i 've never heard anyone suggest we have some sort of authority over them . 
  that 's not the same as ` greater britain ' .
