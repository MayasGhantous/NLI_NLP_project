  the result being a lot of genuinely bad food and bad restaurants , although things seem to have gotten a lot better in the last decade or so . 
  are you living outside the uk , or just talking about the internet ? 
   fast speed trains are much better than in the uk . 
  trenitalia ftw !, 
  having better trains than us probably is n't that hard at the moment though tbf . 
  that 's still one of my favourite threads of all time . 
  is * baise ouai * a thing that people actually say , or is it specific to french reddit ? 
  [ skyarts ] ( http://www.tvguide.co.uk/mobile/channellisting.asp?ch=384#214635398 ) , and to an extent [ bbc4 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/schedules/bbcfour ) . 
   / r/uk seems to believe that these are the worst times we 've ever endured . 
  the people of britain will be okay . 
  i mean , it 's possible to make your point without being hyperbolic . 
  i do n't think people in that sub actually think brexit is worse than the blitz . 
  it 's possible there was a blurring between halloween , [ ` mischief night ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mischief_night ) and guy fawkes night ( which probably became the focus for that kind of revelry in england ) , because they all take place around the same time . 
  what went on might have varied from place to place . 
  for sure though , the modern halloween is a lot * louder * and commercial . 
  but its individual elements ( feasting , getting pissed , practical jokes , trick-or-treating and even [ jack o ' lanterns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jack-o%27-lantern ) ) probably are n't as new as we think . 
  that 's cool . 
  the welsh word for sea is * m\u00f4r * . 
  from the wiki page on [ ` guising ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trick-or-treating ) ( i.e , trick-or-treating ) :  in north america , trick-or-treating has been a halloween tradition since the late 1920s . 
  in britain and ireland the tradition of going house-to-house collecting food at halloween goes back at least as far as the 16th century , as had the tradition of people wearing costumes at halloween . 
  in 19th century britain and ireland , there are many accounts of people going house-to-house in costume at halloween , reciting verses in exchange for food , and sometimes warning of misfortune if they were not welcomed . 
  [ 1 ] the scottish halloween custom of `` guising '' -- children disguised in costume going from house to house for food or money -- is first recorded in north america in 1911 . 
  deliberately manufacturing needs through advertising and pr to fuel growth was developed in the us via the likes of [ edward bernays ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_bernays ) , who used his uncle sigmund freud 's theories to get people to buy more shit . 
  is that completely true ? 
  there are settled communities afaik , with people having local jobs and the kids going to school etc. 
  in which case they have n't * assimilated * ( because then they 'd no longer be roma etc ) , but they do have a measure of integration . 
  yeah , it 's true that people joke about them ( especially about charles and camilla ) , but the royals are still extremely popular . 
  yeah , it 's true that people joke about them ( especially about charles and camilla ) , but the royals are still extremely popular . 
   true , but you 're basing your argument of the assumption that the british empire was as bad as nazi germany nope , i was just responding to your post , in which * you * chose to parallel nazi germany with the be . 
   you 're comparing apples and oranges really because one entity is an empire centered on conquering and trade while the other is a state centered on ethnic cleansing and racial purity . 
  what we did in australia , for example , was n't ethnic cleansing ? 
   but do understand , that the british empire was nowhere near equal to nazi germany . 
  right ... once again , your parallel . 
  but in any case , what the germans ( or any other nation ) got up to has no bearing on the merits or wrongs of the british empire . 
   does n't mean the rest of the world should have their past forgotten . 
  how does people in the uk learning about the empire mean the rest of the world is forgetting about its past ? 
  in any case , if we 're capable of critical thought , we should be capable of looking at the empire remembering that it was n't the ** only ** imperial project , but without feeling so insecure that we have to point fingers at others while doing so . 
  tbf , i have n't seen much evidence of germans saying `` but the nazis built roads !, 
  it was n't all bad ! '', 
  whereas a lot of people here seem to get defensive when you talk about the empire . 
  also german kids are forced to study the war extensively , while i never got taught in school about the bengal famine , for instance . 
  so as far as our culture today goes , you could say there 's a lingering problem in the way we grapple with our imperial history . 
  wow , they even chucked in lgbt and palestine flags too . 
  at least you 'd have an excuse to say ` tabarnak ! ', 
  a lot . 
  it must be tricky keeping them separate in classes if the teachers use be while media is dominated by ae . 
  even i catch myself using americanisms sometimes and have to check myself . 
  i think china will be ( if it is n't already ) ** another ** superpower , not ** the ** superpower . 
  i think the us being so uniquely powerful is an historical anomaly brought about under anomalous circumstances , but nothing lasts forever . 
  so i see the world as becoming more multipolar , like it has been more commonly throughout history . 
  also , as / u/bravasphotos points out , china has really been a ` superpower ' for a very long time . 
  the last century or so of chinese weakness is the novelty , not its rise/return to power . 
  ah sorry , i meant at a caf\u00e9 etc. 
   many lost points on their final exam by being `` mid-atlantic '' most continentals seem to mix the two variants anyway , along with a ` national accent ' based on whatever their native language is . 
  that said , native speakers of other germanic languages are , for the most part , the only people i 've met who can pull off a native sounding , standard be accent . 
  lebanon - seems to be one of the most diverse and tolerant countries in the middle east , has great food and fairouz . 
  would love to go one day . 
  jordan - i know very little about it , other than the monarchy and amazing ancient monuments . 
  the jordanian people i 've met have been very nice . 
  well , england still has some aristo families with norman/anglo-norman surnames that contain those kind of elements . 
  so ` le ' ( the lestrange family ) , ` de ' ( the de walden family ) , and ` fitz ' ( like the fitzalans ) are giveaways , although they do n't signify nobility in every case . 
  i know the aristocracy in wales and scotland mixed to an extent with the french/normans/anglo-normans , so they had their share of this too . 
  i 'm not sure how the native welsh or gaelic systems worked though , i guess with the ` son of ' or ` grand son of ' patrilineal naming custom within the clan system ? 
  grimsby 's too touristy now . 
  i 'd recommend middlesborough or scunthorpe for beautiful , off the beaten track destinations . 
  too late , am now booking tickets to split . 
  yeah , i never mind when people speak english here , as long as they ask first . 
  this is why you should use english ( even after brexit ) , it 's like 50 % french anyways :p . 
  it 's stupid though . 
  people in northern england ( where i 'm from ) hate what they see as their unequal relationship with the south east , then say no to a chance at fairer representation and control . 
  definitely . 
  it 's a beautiful language anyway , so why not . 
  i was joking . 
  but in any case , this is why we need federalism ( while there is still a union ) . 
  ah so just like your relationship with england then : , 
  i 'm from ex-danelaw territory . 
  i always insist on at least asking if people speak english ( in the local language ) before anything else . 
  then in germany i worry they 'll be insulted by my question . 
  the master and margarita . 
  til . 
  how can they tell though ? 
  do scots go around abroad with saltires pinned to their clothes ? 
  edit : i admit though , after living in scotland for 5 years you guys do seem to have less of a problem fucking shit up in public than we do . 
   when they go abroad they are a nightmare . 
  the best way to improve your standing in the eyes of a local , apparently , is to distinguish yourself as scottish , not english . 
  pfft , you ca n't blame it all on us . 
  we 're not letting you off the hook that easily . 
  yeah because i feel like ` britishness ' was based largely on an imperial identity , and now that 's gone we do n't know what it means to be british , other than the nebulous stuff you usually hear people say `` fair play , cups of tea , queuing '' . 
  i do n't necessarily see this as * decline * , more a sign that the model finally needs to change ( federalisation ? 
  ) , but fat chance of that happening . 
   the uk has been in steady decline for a generation or more , is that really true ? 
  seems like we 're doing better now than we were just after the end of the empire in the ` sick man of europe ' days . 
  the random vatican post office van in the square ? 
  10/10 would visit again . 
  i also love those ones . 
  you 're right . 
  but since there 's a fair amount of native english speakers , i reckon there 's a good chance of there being people who want to learn his language ( s ) . 
  there are websites etc where you can go for language exchanges , if you need practice . 
  i use the * hello talk * app to chat with italian speakers . 
  yes !,
