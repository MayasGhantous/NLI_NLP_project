  and you ca n't even get away with using * preterito perfecto * like you can in french and italian , you have to conjugate goddamn simple past all the time which is often irregular . 
  speaker of one of the closest languages to english finds english easy . 
  who 'd have guessed . 
  spanish is bloody awful for tenses . 
  future subjunctive ? 
  wtf spanish ... 
  most brexiters voted against a political and economic structure they decided they dislike , not against eu citizens personally . 
  will you view the scots as stabbing the uk in the back if they leave the union ? 
  i absolutely hate brexit , but imo it 's odd for you to be so emotionally invested in it . 
   i worded my previous comment quite poorly . 
  i mean to say that some people have a large amount of norman dna and some people have a large amount of anglo-saxon dna , sort of how like some people are rich and some people are poor , but on the whole we are a rich country . 
  actually my understanding is the modern day english are a mix of anglo-saxon and the pre-as population ( with a bit of added dane ) . 
   i realised that a lot of the place names round where i live translate directly into norwegian/danish/swedish and were founded by danes . 
  same . 
  bit of an overreaction , do n't you think ? 
  that 's really badass . 
  it comes up again every couple of years , either because the tabloids find some new ` sign of maddie ' or the parents come out with a new appeal . 
  the irony of the mccann case is that people in the uk seem to be sick of the parents now too . 
  that 's the plan !, 
   the uk may come around and change hopefully . 
  i hope so !, 
  not holding my breath though tbh . 
   well , who will you defend us against ? 
  ourselves ? 
  it 's the perfect solution . 
  and unfortunately the uk does n't care for anyone . 
  eh , the portuguese have been mad at us before . 
  the anglo-portuguese alliance is still the oldest alliance in the world . 
  welsh people are ` ruled over ' by english people only in the sense that the english outnumber everyone else . 
  welsh and northern irish mps get a say in westminster over english people 's lives , while the reverse is not true . 
  edit : also i support independence for any of the 4 nations if they want it . 
  seems fair ... but only if england can join up with portugal against you guys again too . 
  i 've seen a few places named after garibaldi in the uk . 
  pretty much . 
  i do n't think the union will stay together unless it changes . 
  there probably wo n't be a british people by that time . 
  you * like * the normans ? 
  but they started the whole english in ireland mess . 
  chill brah , i think it was a joke . 
  i have n't seen ts2 yet , but from what i hear it 's not * as * good but still good . 
  * this is england * * trainspotting * * shaun of the dead * * withnail and i * * four lions *, 
  same . 
  this sub is refreshingly non-bitter . 
  i really wish this was just an american thing , but apparently brits have picked it up as well ( at least online ) . 
  not only is it offensive , it 's also just shit humour . 
  i think it 's largely the same in the uk . 
  i ca n't say how well integrated the traditional roma community is here ( and levels of discrimination/acceptance vary ) , but i do n't think people confuse them with the new group . 
  for england , one of my favourites is probably [ ** avebury ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avebury ) , which is europe 's largest stone circle ( itself containing another two stone circles ) dating to the 3rd millennium bc . 
  the painted caves blow my mind , i 'd really love to see the ones that are publicly accessible . 
  [ *** edmund ironside *** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edmund_ironside ) , king of england who fought the danes . 
  [ *** edward i of england , ` hammer of the scots ' *** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_i_of_england )  , so-called for his hijinx north of the border during braveheart times . 
  [ *** mary i of england , ` bloody mary ' *** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mary_i_of_england ) , named for her persecution of protestants . 
  victoria was also nicknamed ` grandmother of europe ' since her kids and grandkids married into most of europe 's royal houses . 
  madame tussauds ( this applies to british tourists in london too ) . 
  just ... why ? 
  left and right can be authoritarian or libertarian , they do n't only have one shape . 
  weekend treat/hangover food . 
  is that verlan ? 
  i can never figure out how those words happen . 
  new town , also had a room in leith for # 230 . 
  it 's rare but not impossible . 
  that 's true , sorry for the mistake . 
  edinburgh - paying # 250 for a small room ( the avarage for a room being between # 300-400 ) . 
  funny you say the uk as a russian , russia was probably most responsible for stopping him ( though each of the allies played an important part ) . 
  welsh is beautiful imo , there 's something really homey about it . 
  i understand that , i 'm just being a dick . 
  still though people could have a look at what 's been discussed in the past before starting new threads . 
  i try to for this reason . 
  ahhh the weekly ` immigrants in sweden ' thread . 
  talking polar bears ? 
  i do n't come across many people who think english is actually beautiful , most learn it because they have to . 
  you can never take it back now , it 's been established . 
  all english cheeses will now be advertised as `` french approved '' . 
  ah , i did n't mean to come across as salty !, 
  i meant it in a good natured way but did a bad job of conveying that . 
   i just did not want to say out loud that english cheese can be good i got that part :p . 
  it 's so bland though . 
  i loved it as a kid but it has so little flavour . 
  you guys ca n't complain about english cheeses if the only one you know is cheddar ( though i do love a good cheddar ) . 
  alternative trip : prague - vienna - budapest ( or the reverse ) . 
  they 're all packed with culture , are three of the most beautiful cities in europe and ( with the exception of vienna ) will give you a lot more bang for your buck than the west . 
  lol czech republic/bohemia was part of the austro-hungarian and holy roman empires for 900 years . 
  up until the cold war they have historically had more to do with austria and the rest of the empire than with eastern europe . 
  no one refers to vienna as ` eastern europe ' though , and yet it 's further east than prague . 
  it 's arbitrary poo that has more to do with the cold war than geography . 
  where to start ... 
  unless you 're including prague and budapest ( i.e , central europe ) , or russia , i think the only city that gets really hyped is krakow . 
   bohemian \u0158apsody, 
  north wales imo . 
  probably my favourite part of britain . 
  possibly it was a student pub ? 
  there are usually celebrations around my uni for yanks + friends . 
  i thought that 's because in the us you can face descrimination for being from latin america , even if you 're white ? 
  the same way eastern europeans are white but can still get shit in the uk . 
  then i guess we 're stuck with chuka . 
  the only weird aspect of english i can think of is [ collective nouns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_english_terms_of_venery,_by_animal ) , which are often amazing and pretty damn random . 
  examples : a parliament of owls , a murder of crows , a business of ferrets , and a kettle of hawks . 
   no idea for male politicians i guess [ zac goldsmith ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2fi.dailymail.co.uk%2fi%2fpix%2f2014%2f10%2f17%2f1413548917422_wps_38_zac_goldsmith_in_richmond.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2ffemail%2farticle-2797176%2fhandsome-swedish-politician-bombarded-romantic-messages-photo-goes-viral.html&amp;docid=hvozj-stri0mxm&amp;tbnid=mq3xcapouin-vm%3a&amp;vet=1&amp;w=634&amp;h=423&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;bih=593&amp;biw=1280&amp;q=zac%20goldsmith%20handsome&amp;ved=0ahukewi0pobgv5zsahxwfsakhtgkah8qmwgbkaewaq&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8#h=423&amp;imgrc=mq3xcapouin-vm:&amp;vet=1&amp;w=634 ) is the only one who could remotely be described as handsome . 
  why do n't you stick to bologna and maybe do a couple of small excursions to nearby cities ? 
  modena , ravenna , ferrara and even florence are fairly close ( and barring florence all of those cities will be a lot less packed with tourists ) .
