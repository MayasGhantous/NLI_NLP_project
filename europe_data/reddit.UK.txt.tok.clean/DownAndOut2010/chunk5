  where did you get from my post that i support that ? 
  i certainly do n't ( i 'm half-greek , for one thing ) . 
  i 'm saying that 's what already happened in 2015 . 
  so it 's difficult to talk about greece ` not cooperating ' , because when they try and act independently they get fucked over for it . 
   on the contrary your country ... oooh shady . 
  was n't italy involved in afghanistan , iraq and libya ... ? 
  then after ` fighting fascism ' we all partied for years with franco , salazar , pinochet and other fascist parties/juntas . 
  good times . 
   well , they have no legal protection is n't that because they do n't want to be processed in france and thus have to stay there ? 
   greeks would only cooperate in this ... what 's to stop the eu threatening them with expulsion from schengen again like they did over frontex ? 
  is anyone saying that ? 
  there is an imperative for companies to deliver profit . 
  we have multiple historical examples of corporations doing shitty things to maximise profit ( unsafe working conditions , sweat-shop labour , environmental degradation , substituting cheaper ingredients etc ) . 
  this is what employment/health and safety/environmental laws are for . 
  companies behave ethically because they 're compelled to either through laws or consumer pressure , not just because they 've got big hearts of gold and want the world to be a happy place . 
   empirical data says that liberal market policies like free trade are almost always beneficial in the long run . 
  free market policy worked a charm in chile . 
  i certainly do have the right to dispute the claim that one country is ' ** better ** ' than another ( or in this case a whole continent ) in some way , especially considering all those other metrics i mentioned . 
  i 'm responding flippantly to the comments suggesting europe has some sort of deficit in civil liberties compared to the us because of hate crime laws , which i often see on reddit and which i find ridiculous ( for the reasons stated in my post ) . 
  yes , thousands of murders by police , world 's largest prison population , patriot act , mass surveillance , [ 49th ] ( https://index.rsf.org/#!/ ) place for press freedom , solitary for whistleblowers = a shining beacon of civil rights . 
  whereas europe is a totalitarian nightmare because we ca n't say mean things to black people . 
  where did the european dream go so wrong ? 
  beautiful cities , stunning nature , nice people , unique culture , cheap beer ... no ? 
  more for me then . 
  speak another language ? 
  that 's for foreigners . 
  ` nother brit here . 
  2 : honestly , my experience with gps has varied . 
  in my home town in one of the poorest parts of england ( humberside ) , i 've often had problems being taken seriously . 
  friends and family have had similar issues at different surgeries , while my mum was insulted several times by her gp before she changed practice . 
  the gp i 've seen in edinburgh , however , has been absolutely amazing . 
  i get seen almost immediately , staff are always extremely helpful , and i 've had no problem getting tested/referred etc when i 've had health concerns . 
  my experiences with hospitals have always been very positive as well . 
  3 : the nhs is one of the greatest achievements of the uk and needs to be protected at all costs . 
  yeah , but that might change if hundreds of thousands more of us were able to move there . 
   what britain should do is create a free market / ** movement ** area between canada , australia and new zealand that is never going to happen because the aussies , kiwis and canadians would view us basically the way we view eastern europeans . 
  i will never go to any of the camps , for the simple reason that people disrespecting these places fills me with absolute fury . 
  1861 worst year . 
  well , thanks to doing a four year degree ( scotland ) and repeating a year i 'm going to finish with over # 60,000 debt , which will keep growing after graduation . 
  but the terms of repayment are relaxed enough that i 'm not massively bothered by it . 
   as opposed to the current `` sit down and shut up '' ? 
  when was it any different ? 
  in the past it was far , far more disciplinary than it is now ( at least here in the uk ) , with kids getting beaten etc. 
   overuse , , drunk driving , domestic abuse - - a range of criminality and abusive alcohol behavior has a final result of over 8 times as many deaths in the us per year . 
  false equivalence . 
  hand guns ( we have hunting rifles etc ) ca n't be used `` in moderation '' and only have one purpose which is to shoot people . 
  if there is a very low risk of encountering criminals with guns in the uk there 's little justification that they 're needed for self defence , since legalising them here will only create the situations which necessitate gun ownership in the first place ( e.g , several thousand murders ) . 
   the overwhelming majority of the nearly 1/3rd of the us population , 100 million people , who own guns , are part of a centuries long tradition in the us of not fucking with anyone , while owning guns . 
  if americans want guns , go nuts . 
  put it down to different traditions/cultures . 
  most people here do n't want them though , and i ca n't see that changing any time soon , no matter how authoritarian you think it is . 
  who said anything about lawful or unlawful ? 
  the final result is 10,000 people killed by guns . 
  it makes sense that criminals with guns are going to do more damage - most criminals in the uk do n't get that chance . 
  we do n't want guns man . 
  maybe you think it 's worth nearly [ 10,000 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20759139 ) murders by firearm in one year to have guns , but we do n't ( figure for the same year in england and wales , with a combined population of 56 million , was [ 55 ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116417/hosb1011.pdf ) ) . 
  i mean , your country birthed the patriot act and spies on the entire planet . 
  you 've had more people murdered by your own police force in the last decade than were killed in 9/11 ( if [ these ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database ) [ stats ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database ) are a reliable indicator ) . 
  but sure , the uk is a totalitarian society because no guns . 
  ( edit : formatting ) 2nd edit : total recorded murders in england and wales in 2011 was [ 642 ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116417/hosb1011.pdf ) ( firearm and total murder stats on pages 57 and 42 , respectively . ), 
  tell that to all the people who want to emigrate but ca n't get visas - you make it sound very definite . 
   i 'm a fan of free movement but i think your argument is broadly daft . 
  i think you ;d find that quite a large proportion of the thousands of brtis living elsewhere in the eu would agree , because it largely would n't have any impact on them or people like them . 
  i 'm referring to a brexit ( based largely on the issue of immigration ) . 
  how would the uk withdrawing from the eu not be an issue for uk citizens living on the continent ? 
  of course there 's the possibility of a norway type deal , but then i wonder again why eu members would agree to a one-way deal in which we can move freely but they ca n't . 
  do you think the hundreds of thousands of brits living on the continent will agree ? 
  ( edit , because facetious one-line answers are n't productive : i do get the sense in the conversation about brexit etc that people think there should be one rule for us and another for everyone else . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/22/eu-migration-confused-poll-free-movement_n_6026550.html ) was released last year , if a single poll is anything to go by . ), 
   the uk has access to a bunch of opt-outs , so i 'm not really sure what you 're on about in that regard . 
  eu is tyrannical because it wo n't give us free travel while letting us keep all those foreigners out , basically . 
   the fine difference is one puts bullets into thousands of innocent people my government has been doing that for the last decade , tbf . 
  ( edited . ), 
   how would you ` prove ' being gay though ? 
  but the comments above are about why serbians would see nato as a threat ? 
  i 'm sure `` we totally have a reason for bombing you '' was a reassuring message for them . 
  we bombed the shit out of them ? 
   it goes against the very basis of economics and free market capitalism . 
  yeah , but no country in the world is fully laissez faire capitalist . 
  the entire point of social democracy is for government institutions to mediate between citizens and market forces , or we 'd have no labour laws etc ( which also go against the basics of free market capitalism ) . 
  yeah , but there are 28 members now , not just six , so maybe that should be up for debate now that the climate is different ? 
  i mean , if historical precedent is justification in itself then britain 's opt-outs ( along with its rebate ) should n't be a bone of contention . 
  i.e , if the eu/eec at that time accepted the uk 's conditions for accession this constitutes ` historical legitimacy ' as much as any other negotiations or treaties . 
  we all have our privileges , i suppose . 
  we get opt-outs , you get strasbourg ... 
  except turkey is not just fighting pkk but also aiding isis ? 
  why the fuck should they listen to anything we have to say though , when they know the uk public might vote to leave regardless of any renegotiations ? 
  sorry , my comment is aimed more at people complaining about the situation in europe while forgetting about greece , italy etc , not at turkey and countries from the region . 
  memrise has welsh . 
  check out memrise . 
  it 's still pretty duolingo-ish , but has multiple courses for different languages ( including some michael thomas courses ) . 
  greece has been dealing with this problem for years , even though they 're dirt poor . 
  that 's how golden dawn managed to get so many votes . 
  northern countries did not give two shits until it started being their problem . 
   have you heard how people talk about germany in many european countries ... 
  seems to me like the attitude goes both ways to be fair , i.e the endless comments people make in northern europe about dirty greeks/italians/piigs etc. 
  i 'm surprised people think this is anything but business as usual . 
  we 've been partying with dictatorships/human rights abusers since ... well , forever ( pinochet , suharto , videla , aparthied south africa , the shah , gadafi , saudi arabia and pretty much every government in the middle east ) . 
  human rights is a weapon to be selectively wielded at opponents ( russia , iran , and previously china ) , while the abuses and corruption of friends gets no mention . 
  our government could not give fewer fucks as long as they achieve whatever the current strategy is .
