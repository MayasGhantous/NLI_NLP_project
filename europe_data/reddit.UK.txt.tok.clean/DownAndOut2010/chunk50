  of course it 'd be amazing to see any of the cities on your list even for just a few hours , but getting to see a bit of a region would probably be better than trying to pack too much in , and would make for a less hectic vacation . 
  i prefer it without water though :( . 
  labour are fucking awful . 
  but every 4 years it 's them or the tories, 
  i have ( to my shame ) still never seen any of bergman 's films . 
  is there a film you 'd recommend i start with ? 
  i mean , the remake ought to have been good considering the source material they had to work with . 
  up until the 1980s it was the biggest self-reported white ethnic group ( at nearly 50 million ) , but it 's since diminished . 
  probably because it 's not cool/exotic enough . 
  note the statement is ` ancestors in the country ' , not that those ancestors have to be white . 
  i tend to agree with you , but then i would never tell a jew or someone from a minority group that their sense of ethnic identity is bullshit because culture is n't something you inherit . 
  to them it clearly is . 
  * god save the queen * . 
  most englishman/brits ( ? ), 
  will know the one verse but not the rest of the song . 
  not a great anthem to be honest . 
  * land of hope and glory * or * jerusalem * would be much better . 
  i 'd ask this in r/unitedkingdom or r/askuk . 
  gives me the creeps every time i go past it . 
  i once took a look at r/altright expecting it to be along the lines of r/the _ d. 
  the first thread i found contained comments explaining how gays should be gassed and thrown in ovens . 
   it 's a symptom of an economy that does no longer work for a lot of people and the traditional parties failed to solve in any meaningful way . 
  that , and people cynically exploiting these issues to get votes . 
   we have `` voi '' ( second plural person ) which was popularized by the fascist regime , but is now considered too formal and outdated . 
  is it true that people still use the ` voi ' form in the south ? 
  whoa , a czech monarchist . 
  do you favour a monarchy for czechia then ( if so who would be the contenders ) ? 
  i missed that part . 
  comment edited . 
  left-libertarian ( apparently -8 / -8.92 ) . 
  they can change their name to whatever they want to , but greece will attempt to fuck with them diplomatically ( for instance blocking any accession talks with the eu ) if they do . 
  i do n't think greece is paranoid because of ` ancient glory times ' , they 're paranoid because they think macedonian nationalists will want to annex ` lower macedonia ' . 
  according to the [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute#recent_proposals_and_the_.22double_name_formula.22 ) on the subject various alternatives have been proposed such as * new macedonia * , * upper macedonia * , and the * republic of macedonia-skopje * , but greece has ~ ~ always ~ ~ largely been hostile to names that include ` macedonia ' . 
  ( edit following the comment below . ), 
  yeah but the ironic thing about the american system is it costs them more anyway . 
  they have collectivism , it 's just for the rich and corporations rather than the rest of society . 
  i guess i think of the us as being close to europe ( for obvious reasons ) but also its own thing . 
  so a liberal state represents liberal america rather than europe . 
  i also do n't really subscribe to the notion that europe is any one thing anyway , i see it more as a cultural continuum than a whole . 
  maybe the us and europe ( an countries ) are just different points on the same spectrum . 
  it 's more liberal but i 'm not sure i 'd think of it as european . 
  yeah , i 'd expect you to feel cultural commonality with ireland or mann ( or even germanic countries ) , but beyond ` not english ' and ` celtic speaking ' i wondered how close the similarity would really be between brythonics and gaels . 
   parts of scotland have a lot in common with ireland , as rural comm the on hard land that have suffered the ravages of emigration ; other parts of scotland bear more similarities to south wales on terms of post-industrial areas fallen on hard times . 
  northern england has you covered on post-industrial neglect , if not the same history of emigration . 
   either the uk changes and becomes a federal state ( meaning that england would have to be broken down into regions , otherwise the 80 % of the population outweighs the scots no matter what ) or scotland becomes independent . 
  speaking as an englishman , i also wish this country would federalise , but i doubt westminster will tolerate it until it 's too late and the uk breaks up . 
  they 've got too used to the same model after 300 years . 
  also do the gaels and brythonic celts ( the welsh , cornish and bretons ) really have that much in common just by virtue of speaking related languages ? 
  otherwise elgar 's pomp and circumstance . 
  so in other words , you came for validation of your pre-held beliefs about the topic . 
  tbf though , the paris we know and love today was constructed by destroying a lot of the old city . 
  maybe in the 19th century people thought the same way about haussmann 's renovations . 
  i always thought of tolkien 's ` dark tower ' , but ministry of love works too . 
  there are tall buildings across the uk but i 'd say only london ( and only a small part of that ) is particularly skyscrapery . 
  a lot of the old city scapes were damaged in the blitz and buildings replaced with more modern architecture , so there 's been less resistance to modern or avant garde construction since there 's less ` harmony ' to disrupt to begin with . 
  ( apparently a new 300 metre building is being planned for the city , which hopefully wo n't end up looking like [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=london+walkie+talkie&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiq_--pxnnrahxlivqkhvjfb10q_auicsgc&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=607 ) butt-ugly monstrosity . ), 
  social welfare is hardly unique to the uk . 
  yeah but ` historically ' ? 
  also , wtf does op mean by this ? 
   they [ the uk ] historically have always been a `` nannystate '', 
  i see my identity as european ( as well as british ) , but i guess it 's less common here than in other euro countries . 
  only on ukip leaflets . 
  we do n't ? 
  i always do . 
   who would get profit ? 
  britain mwahaha . 
  also because she was extremely unpopular around the time she married charles because people viewed her as a homewrecker . 
  i guess that 's more in line with the ` west ' as meaning pax americana , which does n't include russia . 
  tbf i think a lot of the idolisation of remembrance day is more about the world wars ( which are symbolically massive important for the national mythos ) than about modern veterans . 
   it 's a circle really . 
    america took a lot of the worst influences of the uk and that became their stable ... and then the uk ... kind started to get over those but is again being influenced by it 's own original mentality back from the us . 
   can you explain what you mean by this ? 
  are you suggesting the uk is getting militarism from the us ? 
  so you posted about 20 times in one thread in r/europe about how you 're so sick of brexit and do n't want to talk about it ( yet could n't resist taking about it ) , and now you 're posting in another sub about the thing you do n't want to talk about . 
  seems logical . 
  this is the last time i complain about the uk being expensive . 
   but i do n't think i 've spent more than $ 200 so far . . 
  so i guess it 's as expensive as you make it ? 
  that 's good to know for future reference . 
  i never know what to make of different peoples ' idea of ` budget ' , because i tend to push the limits of cheapness . 
  i have no idea what the fuck you 're all talking about in any of these damn threads . 
  english : native , used all the time . 
  italian : upper-intermediate ( b2-ish ) . 
  mostly restricted to reading books , articles etc. 
  i do n't really speak it when i 'm not in italy . 
  french and spanish : basic proficiency ( active a2 , comprehension maybe b1 ) . 
  i use spanish a few times a week in classes at uni , french almost never . 
   we only get nordic crime dramas broadcast on bbc . 
  the number of foreign programmes seems to have been increasing a bit lately though , what with all the stuff on walter ( channel 4 online ) , like deutschland 83 etc , as well as the scandi/french/italian crime dramas on bbc and sky . 
  occitan is my favourite romance language ( along with italian ) !, 
  shame there are n't more learning resources for it . 
  one of the worst is a place from my home county called belvoir , which is pronounced ` beaver ' . 
  you can say ` twelf ' , you 'll just sound like you 're from london . 
  it 's the closest language to english . 
  englishman living in scotland here . 
  funnily enough some of the foreigners i know in edinburgh told me ( soft ) scottish accents are easier for them to understand than most english accents . 
   what i consider high-market : i 'm not asking which publications you like , i 'm asking how you 're defining good journalism . 
   i genuinely avoid the bbc/reuters like the plague . 
  that 's nice , but can you tell me how they 're ` left-wing biased ' ? 
  so what for you constitutes high quality journalism ?
