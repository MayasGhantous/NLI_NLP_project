  how are bbc and reuters ` left-wing biased ' ? 
  also equating the guardian with the dm is a bit ridiculous . 
  apart from their recent fuck up with julian assange their non-editorial journalism has been pretty solid . 
  * it 's the current year !, 
  * mostly shit i see online , since most people i encounter offline tend not to talk like twats . 
  it 's like a shortened form of ` cornuto ' , but the meaning 's been extended to mean ` weak male ' . 
  it 's a fucking ridiculous word that automatically lets me know people using it ( without irony ) deserve no attention . 
  three weeks is a decent amount of time for a trip , but if you want it to span the north * and * south you might not have time to explore outside of the big cities , so if you want to get off the beaten track a bit you might be better off choosing one or two regions and sticking to those . 
  that would allow you to get a better sense of a region too ( if that interests you ) , rather than just doing pit-stops at the bigger cities . 
  for example , maybe you could explore emilia-romagna ( bologna , modena , parma , ravenna , rimini etc ) , then move down to rome to finish . 
  yep . 
  now making the most of my vpn before that too gets targeted and becomes illegal . 
  truly we 're living in a golden age . 
  we can eat whisky now ? 
  gov 's [ gone ahead ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/investigatory-powers-act-bill-snoopers-charter-spying-law-powers-theresa-may-a7503616.html ) with it anyway ( apparently it came into force on new year 's eve ) , i guess because they feel that they can get away with it while they 're appealing the judgement from ecj . 
  snooper 's charter . 
  ** scotland ** : [ tam lin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tam_lin ) , which is a border scots ballad about a woman who has to save a knight from the queen of the faeries . 
  ** england ** : [ gawain and the green knight ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sir_gawain_and_the_green_knight ) ( if arthurian literature counts ) . 
  ** wales ** : [ taliesin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanes_taliesin ) and [ math fab mathonwy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/math_fab_mathonwy ) , from a medieval collection of tales called the [ mabinogion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mabinogion#four_branches_of_the_mabinogi ) . 
  i mean , there are parts of north america that have only really been settled by europeans since the 19th century . 
  what 's your cut off date by which people are entitled to call the land they live on theirs ? 
  i think it 's overrated in the sense that people go expecting it to be some kind of fairy tale , and are disappointed to find out it 's actually a living city with modern capital city problems . 
  i like paris , personally . 
  ibsen 's fairly well known in the uk ( he was my first thought anyway ) . 
  same . 
  the kids in my classes at school were even bad with european geography ( and i mean naming and locating capital cities , not rivers and mountain ranges etc ) . 
  there are a few universities that teach old english , as well as older forms of gaelic and welsh ( including their associated literatures ) . 
  example course : https://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/, 
  i really enjoyed * il gattopardo * , even though people seem not to like it . 
  it 's amazingly depressing . 
  i recently read svejk for the first time !, 
  i 'm not sure how well the humour translates , but it was cynical enough for me to enjoy it . 
  good point . 
  i did see a lot of that stuff spreading around fb at the time , and groups like britain first were getting a lot of circulation . 
  do you think the refugee crisis had that much of an impact ? 
  it might have helped tip the scale in favour of leave , but imo anger over inter-eu migration has riled people up the most . 
  also successive governments for never really pushing education on what the eu actually * is * and also for using it as a convenient scapegoat to deflect blame and attention over the years . 
  scots is a separate language technically . 
  but yeah , the only types of english i struggle to understand in terms of accent alone are some of the different variants within the uk . 
  alain delon , romain duris , daniel auteil , lea seydoux ... 
  cruz is good in * volver * and * vicky , christina , barcelona * . 
  i generally like her spanish-speaking performances more than her work in english-speaking roles . 
  currently learning italian ( b2-ish ) and spanish ( a2-ish ) . 
  interested in french ( which i can read fairly well but ca n't use actively ) , german and czech , which is my favourite slavic language . 
  i 've wanted to learn basic old english for ages , but keep putting myself off thinking it 'd be more useful to start learning german . 
  it 's probably more people thinking they support the noble struggle for freedom against the oppressor . 
  this is beautiful . 
  also r/accidentalrenaissance, 
   if you want the root cause of all the mess you could say the sykes-picot agreement started the snow ball rolling . 
  this is definitely true - the uk and france have been destabilising the middle east since before it was cool . 
  however , it seems like international terrorism really only took off in the last few decades ( thanks to regime changes and exporting of wahabism by nutjobs in the gulf states etc. ), 
  all the buckfast we give you and this is the thanks we get . 
  no chance . 
  we 're relying on sealand for a glorious new free trade deal to replace the business we 'll lose outside of the eu . 
  yeah , the foreign born/non-ethnic japanese population in japan is tiny . 
  they 're not fans of immigration at all . 
  i always thought much of that came from al andaluz as well ? 
  maybe i was wrong . 
   not sure about the uk ( scottish nationalism will win in the end i fear , because lefty nationalism is so much more palatable to the chateratti than than the right-wing variety ) but england 's been around for over 1000 years now and i ca n't see it going anywhere . 
  i disagree that it 's got anything to do with ` leftism ' , there 's just much less identification with ` britishness ' now among the three nations ( i ca n't speak for norn iron 's relationship with the uk ) . 
  from the [ 2011 census ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24302914 ) 62 % of scots , 60 % of the english and 58 % of the welsh identify exclusively with their home nation rather than britishness . 
  i quite like \u010ce\u0161ka , but czechia 's probably the one that will stick . 
  +1 for czechia . 
  most of the czechs i know in the uk now use it . 
   so i 'm just sayin ' being asian is n't being conservative in a lot of cases . 
  oh definitely , i just made the point because people talk as though there 's a sudden , massive cultural gulf once you cross the ` boundary ' of europe , which i do n't really agree with . 
  i like that flag , personally . 
  the funny thing about istanbul is that on the european side you have fatih , which is a super conservative area where a lot of women wear burqas etc , and on the ` asian ' side you have kadik\u00f6y , which is fairly liberal . 
  yeah , as an outsider ( correct me if i 'm wring ) i think i 'd class turkey as * balkan * before anything else . 
  anyway , my take on this is that turkey is european and not european , like russia . 
  personally i think the idea of a single european identity is a recent one anyway , and turkey just represents the other side of the cultural continuum . 
  turkey is massively mixed , how do you separate the ` non-europeans ' from the europeans ? 
  also , if europe is christian , are albanians , kosovans and bosnians not european then ? 
  cyprus is n't in europe . 
   turks are n't really european so they 'd have to be assimilated or deported . 
  how are you defining european ? 
  ooooh , how have you been getting on with persian ? 
  i 've been wanting to start learning it for a while now . 
  why eastern thrace but not turkey ? 
  there are economic arguments for and against , but the thing i do n't like about it is it enshrines class difference in the uk 's constitution . 
  the vast majority of europeans probably wo n't really care , and will treat it on an individual basis if they encounter it . 
  being on reddit means you see the same tropes and posts over and over again until it becomes annoying and something you begin to associate with a certain type of poster . 
  i asked an american friend where the underground railroad was . 
  yes i thought it was an actual railroad that ran underground . 
  i can only guess that by asking this here , instead of in r/askuk or r/unitedkingdom ( presumably because you know you 'd get a poor reception there ) , you 're attempting to bait the continentals . 
  i think what wwi is noted for is its generation-destroying effect . 
  it did n't just claim a massive sum of lives ( and mark a horrific new kind of warfare ) , but it was the beginning of the end for a certain kind of britain . 
  there 's a wwi memorial at my university to the couple of hundred students who died . 
  it 's not just the waste of it all ( all those kids just at the start of their adult lives ) that 's extremely depressing , i also ca n't imagine suddenly losing so much of your community . 
  not to mention cypriots . 
  is n't cr\u00e8me anglaise thinner and sweeter than usual custard ? 
   `` excuse me , i am so sorry to interrupt you , but could i please very sincerely ask you if you would be so kind as to pass me the salt ? '', 
  steady on , no need to be so blunt about it . 
  i would say fairness for england , rather than fortitude . 
  that 's what 's underpinned basically a thousand year 's worth of social struggles , and maybe that 's why we 're not the quickest to rebel when the government intrudes ( because there has traditionally been a notion that if you obey the law , the law will treat you fairly ) . 
  obviously that does n't mean england and the uk are particularly ` fair ' socially or economically , since we 're still a rather unequal society . 
  men : most southern european countries . 
  women : more central and eastern european countries . 
  both : france . 
  brits are easy to spot when it 's the trashy kind or it 's mad bantz time ( usually wearing several layers of clothes less than locals , no matter what the weather is ) .
