  ` my mad fat diary ' ( uk ) sounds a bit like this , in terms of issues the plot explores . 
  also +1 for skins . 
  because it 's not just about if we should leave but * how * . 
  should we have full brexit ? 
  should we try and aim for an efta type deal with free movement ? 
  i do n't think that should be left to may and co without input from parliament . 
  that 's my usual policy when i 'm abroad . 
  if the person i 'm talking to does speak english i let them switch . 
  if not , i break out the ancient art of handwaving . 
  holy hell which part of the city are you in ? 
  i 've got a room in canonmills for # 270 ( i know this is absurdly cheap , but the average is still only around # 400 ) . 
  imo it needs debating in parliament before going ahead . 
  that said , it 's appropriate that countries can leave if they want to as countries are still sovereign . 
  do you have any recommendations for the north ? 
  i should be going to thessaloniki next year and i 'd like to see more of the region . 
  11 countries so far and donegal is still one of the most beautiful places i 've ever been . 
  this is a tricky one because i know most people in scandi countries are supposed to speak amazing english , but i 'd feel really rude just going up to someone and * assuming * they can ( or should ) speak english . 
  you just have your own version of political correctness - every country does ( i.e , ` polish death camps ' ) . 
  i think san marino 's too far off the rome - tuscany - cinque terre - venice route that most people take to become too overcrowded . 
  i do n't agree with the other brit that it was n't a big deal here : it was , which is why we went to war pretty much no questions asked . 
  the civil war ? 
  true . 
  anyway , in reaponse to op : the reaction in the uk was pretty much universal shock and outrage . 
  i remember watching the news in disbelief as a kid after the first plane hit . 
  another part of what made it so shocking was the way it continued with the people trapped in the buildings . 
  bad times . 
  not that it was n't shocking and appalling , but i think one of the biggest reasons it gets reported all the time is because it was * america * . 
  it 's not just a matter of the scale of the tragedy : if it were , the 2004 asian tsunami or the pakistani earthquake ( both of which have been pretty much forgotten ) would be much more important to us . 
  we 'll go when you frenchies go !, 
  r/uk is massively torn on corbyn , despite apparently being a ` leftie circlejerk ' . 
  there 's hardly uniform support for him there . 
  it 's probably not that shitty , just the least pretty place i 've been in italy . 
  the part i saw was quite industrial and there were a lot of prostitutes and gangster wannabes around . 
   in krak\u00f3w it 's adviced to have machette for selfdefence is that for keeping the drunk brits away ? 
  the shittiest place i 've encountered so far in italy is mestre . 
  they do n't have to be white either . 
  chavs can be any race/ethnicity . 
  yes . 
  it 's more about how they dress and what their lifestyle is than where they 're from . 
  you 're * polish * and you find german cases difficult ... ? 
  moved 300 km for uni . 
  by us standards i suppose that 's still close ? 
  so edgy . 
  also have to plug guccini . 
  out of the places i 've been so far it has to be ireland . 
  also yes we 're europeans . 
  northern england is pretty friendly , as are brummies . 
  eh , it 's around # 300 for a room / # 600 for a basic one-bed flat on average . 
  is that crazy compared to the rest of the uk ? 
  lol . 
  englishman living in edinburgh here !, 
  i have no knowledge of how romanians are faring in scotland , so ca n't address that specifically . 
  however , for what it 's worth i do have friends/have met many people here from other parts of eastern europe who tell me edinburgh is much more accepting of them than the uk in general . 
  people from different nationalities seem to mix here much more than other places i 've been to around the country . 
  as for being gay , i 'm gay too and while overt homophobia does happen it 's fairly rare . 
  otherwise as u/t90fan says it 's pretty gay-friendly . 
  in general i 'd say edinburgh is ( by uk standards ) extremely liberal with great quality of life . 
  i completely understand your hesitation though in light of brexit and the ill-feeling towards romanians . 
  if i were you , i 'd maybe see if there are facebook groups for romanians living in each of your target cities so you can ask them directly how they 've found the experience . 
  if you need any pointers about the city , feel free to pm me ( or maybe head over to r/edinburgh or r/scotland ) . 
  good luck with your choice !, 
  shout out for * minchia * . 
  legit my favourite word in italian ( even if it 's more of a southern thing ) . 
  ** france : ** - un prophete - hiroshima mon amour - la haine ** italy : ** - l'eclisse - mio fratello e ' figlio unico ** austria : ** - the white ribbon ** ireland : ** - song of the sea ** germany : ** - aguirre , wrath of god + fitzcarraldo - the baader-meinhoff complex ** spain : ** - pan 's labyrinth - all about my mother ( and anything else by almodovar ) also , this thread has made me realise my knowledge of czech , polish and russian cinema is shit . 
   i honestly think people sometimes just downvote posts or comments because they are written by americans . 
  i think that 's partially because / r/europe gets trolled a lot by people wandering in from subs like / r/the _ donald to tell us how shit our continent is . 
  after a while it gets old hearing about how europe is now a ` muzrat ' regressive left rapefugee caliphate and people get trigger happy . 
  i guess what goes for ` great ' will depend on the person . 
  but i 've been to poland and really liked it ( though of course staying somewhere as a tourist and living there are different ball games ) . 
  ha sure , why not ? 
  i 'd like to live abroad after uni , and poland 's a great country . 
   mostly be . 
  if we used ae pronunciation , we were actually told that we were pronouncing the words wrong . 
  on a more serious note , most continentals i 've met in the uk seem to speak a mix of the two . 
   you do n't need credit history just like in us what is this magical utopia you come from ? 
  credit history is one of the banes of my life . 
  it 's a pretty , central european , former hapsburg , ex-yugo country with stunning nature and slavoj zizek . 
  wish we could return the sentiment !, 
  but our number one frenemy neighbour will always be france . 
  really ? 
  i feel like most people really like the irish and ireland ( except for the most conservative englishmen or people personally affected by ira bombings ) . 
  good job our national team is so shit the pain is short-lived each big tournament . 
  it 's my only consolation . 
  i 'd squeeze * the white ribbon * in there somewhere . 
  i read that in the 19th/early 20th centuries jews in czechia were viewed with suspicion because they were seen to be too * german * , which struck me as incredibly ironic . 
  most of my knowledge of the huguenots and the bartholomew 's day massacre comes from * la reine margot * , if it 's any consolation . 
  we 've spent the last 1,000 years rebelling ( we were one of the first nations to abolish the monarchy and kill our king ) . 
  imo things not being * quite * bad enough for a full scale revolution in the last century or so , combined with anti-labour policy post-thatcher is what 's kept us complacent more recently . 
  hersheys is a sin against humankind . 
  there are much better cheap american chocolates ( like mars and reece 's ) . 
  i feel bad about what we did to ireland , other atrocities committed throughout the empire ( the treatment of indigenous peoples , the bengal famine etc ) , and the slave trade . 
  in more recent history i feel shitty about the uk 's participation in iraq and afghanistan , the eviction of the [ chagos islanders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chagos_archipelago ) , the iranian coup , and our collusion with dictators/brutal governments like pinochet , suharto , and the al saud family . 
  there 's kind of a lot to choose from . 
  shout out to [ king stephen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen,_king_of_england ) , who refused to recognise [ matilda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empress_matilda ) as henry i 's heir and took the throne for himself , ushering in a [ civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_anarchy ) that lasted 20 years . 
  i 've always seen europe as a kind of continuum tbh , with countries in each region influencing and interacting with their neighbours most . 
  russia ( and maybe controversially turkey ) are at the end of that continuum . 
   most people in europe - although i will exclude finland , sweden , and norway from this - have no idea what being really alone in nature is like . 
  i miss being able to do that sort of thing ; driving for an hour or 90 minutes and being able to get away from everyone else if you feel like it . 
  do you think this is a state-by-state thing in the us or does it hold in general ? 
  the uk has some big national parks ( very little of which you can really call wilderness ) but it feels very far away , and the population density makes it hard to feel like you 're ever alone .
