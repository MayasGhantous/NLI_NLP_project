middle earth, 
  you 're using up my bandwidth !, 
  do n't forget the drinks !, 
  being agnostic , i disagree . 
  but to each their own . 
  jesus i ca n't even look at it !, 
  i hope where ever these souls are , they are in a better place . 
  someone call poland !, 
  bourbon master race !, 
  yeah , they were that bad !, 
  moscow had the launch codes . 
  it was one of the reasons why ukraine gave up thier nuclear weapons, 
  yes people would still be killed , but without the funding of rebels by the west it is more than likely the syrian government would have been able to contain the situation . 
  and as of isis they are a direct result of the invasion of iraq . 
  so yeah the middle east might not have been a paradise but in terms of stability and safety for the region it would have been a lot better off without western involvement . 
  got ta rescue those oppressed british minorities !, 
  `` witch !, 
  burn the witch !! '', 
  hey you leave liechtenstein out of this !, 
  subtly is not rt 's forte is it ? 
  [ you 'd like horrible histories then . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qskaawkmd4 ), 
  a few years back my family and i were driving though france on the way to a holiday in spain and we drove though paris . 
  we quickly got lost and pulled off one of the highways ( or whatever they are called ) and ended up what i can only describe as a slum . 
  it was shocking how such a place like that could exist and yet never be reported on by the english speaking media . 
  send help - the netherlands, 
  you dropped this \\, 
  he 's one of the lads !, 
  .  implying that there are n't dark elves in winterhold .  implying there are n't orc strongholds all over skyrim .  implying that khajiit are n't still allowed in skyrim, 
  like skyrim but with genocides - ign, 
  god those comments gave me cancer, 
  but the children !!!! 1 !, 
  to any irish people out there , does anyone actually believe this sh * t ? 
  or malta with no civizens, 
  german greens = / = english and welsh greens, 
  norwich ? 
  to be honest those are the things i do n't like about the greens , though hopefully with all the new support from former lib dems those policies will be gone next conference . 
  darn dark elves coming over here and taking our jobs !, 
  dozens !, 
  here 's hoping we at least do n't lose our brighton seat !, 
  greens . 
  i mean they 're anti- austerity , pro-europe , are willing to encourage renewable energy developments , want to legalise drugs and want to reform the voting system . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  also my mp is also the pm so it might wake him up a bit if a left win party gets a decent % . 
  well if they have around the same mp count then the main parties can form a coalition government , if the conservatives do this they will remain in power , if they do n't things get more complicated : # firstly cameron could recommend a labour led government to the queen ( this is more likely if labour has a higher vote % and would lead to a labour government and cameron resigning as pm ) , but he does n't have to . 
  this will lead to a crunch vote in the house of commons where all mps vote on who will be the next pm ( if this is the case labour would probably win due to the amount of non-labour left wing parties ) . 
  # but again cameron does n't have to resign and the house of commons has a vote of no confidence ( the last time this happened was in [ 1979 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_vote_of_no_confidence_in_the_government_of_james_callaghan ) ) , this will almost certainly decide who will form the government . 
  if this fails to decide the pm then another election is scheduled for some time around june and the whole thing starts over again !, 
  edit : [ heres a useful flowchart ] ( http://news.channel4.com/election2015/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/06_flowchart_full-none_lrg-473x1500.jpg ), 
  really close , both parties ( the conservatives and labour ) are polling at around 33 % each . 
  labour has a slight change of `` winning '' , though whoever wins there will most likely be a hung parliament and another coalition government . 
  i believe that the end of the universe will come not through enthalpy , but instead when japan runs out of things to turn into cute cartoon girls . 
  yeah i remember the scientists working there saying that the black holes would take around the entire current age of the universe to become large enough to absorb a single atom . 
  remember when everyone thought that the collided would cause a black hole that would swallow up the earth ? 
  ah good times, 
  hence why i said most dependencies . 
  some , like bermuda for example , most likely could survive as an independent state but choose [ not to ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bermudian_independence_referendum,_1995 ) . 
  but for the most part they are simply too small and isolated to sustain themselves as a state for any decent amount of time . 
  yeah !, 
  got ta protect them strategic polar bear reserves !, 
  and for that reason [ hans island must be liberated from its oppressors ] ( http://freehansisland.com/ ), 
  yeah it 's kind of like many european dependencies in that regard , they simply just would n't be able to function without supplies and resources coming to them from their respective countries . 
  new zealand , its essentially just the u.k. in the southern hemisphere . 
  also who could resist these adorable [ fellas ] ( http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/sites/all/files/birds%20online%20cd1%20084.jpg ), 
  next they 're gon na threatened to invade the fareo islands or some shit, 
  swedish black gay jewish lizard nazis !, 
  \u00d6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6hhhh !, 
  get on our level , [ m8 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_united_kingdom ) !, 
  and my axe, 
  no yanis i keep telling you , we can not fix the economy with hats !!!, 
  i 'm going to build a wall !, 
  tbf most of the deaths in the 70s and 80s where from the troubles . 
  now we need a finnish nutshells in a person . 
  stay turned for more `` putin it on ! '', 
  after the break . 
  what a twist !, 
  so should you , 
  cool , shame i 've only just started the game and am probably going to get wrecked . 
  ca n't it be both ? 
  * readies longbow *, 
  well he is french ... 
  long as long as dup exist as part of the power-sharing agreement . 
  brb going to italy . 
  quick to luxembourg !!!, 
  did n't stop the normans . 
  it 's been pretty much 50 % unionist , 40 % nationalist and 10 % other for decades . 
  i though you were referencing the uk bases in cyprus not some sinn fein wank . 
  was n't the exactly the point of the good friday agreement ? 
  seriously the ulstermen ( northern irish or whatever you want to call them ) have been strongly pro uk since the williamite war , there 's a reason they split from the irish free state almost immediately . 
  this ai n't eu4 mate , you just ca n't annex a country any more . 
  i 've never heard anything bad about the poles , and most romanians are fine ( it 's the gypsies that you have to worry about and they 've been in the country for centuries ) . 
  yeah , literally every minority group in the uk that has immigrated to here in the past century has been nothing but peace and integrated successful . 
  it 's only the muslim population that 's causing problems and that 's almost completely down to the saudis spreading their hateful ideology to third generation immigrants who are suffering from a cultural identity crisis . 
  french algeria also had hundreds of churches and synagogues that are now mosques . 
  yep , they had colonies all over the place . 
  in crimea , georgia , italy , north africa , spain and france . 
  not to mention they also controlled a trade city in eqypt called [ naucratis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naucratis ) . 
  yep and it failed horribly and financially bankrupted them . 
  so much so that the only option they had at the time was to accept the act of union or otherwise collapse . 
  well it 's one of the few times we drew a couple of lines on a map , made a country out of it and it turned out to be pretty successful .
