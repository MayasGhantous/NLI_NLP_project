  ah ok as for the chinese tourists , i agree is utterly insane . 
  they are everywhere and in so many numbers that they can ruin certain areas . 
  take the bizarre example of chinese tourists inspecting the homes ( and residents ) of an ordinary english suburb . 
  [ no seriously this actually happened . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-37820663 ) another great example of tourism wrecking otherwise niche and cultured places are stonehenge . 
  i have family who visited in the mid-70s , and boy was it different . 
  * there was no entry fee ( provided you were willing to scale a small fence ) , no visitor centre , you could climb all other it [ and use it as an overnight sleeping ground without anyone bothering you ] ( http://68.media.tumblr.com/18eef9fa7eb7117f6fa3bcf68f611605/tumblr_mrw3d08kj71sddfg2o1_500.jpg ) if you so wished . 
  * but now ... [ well ... ] ( http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130530190135-summer-solstice-stonehenge-crowd-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg/&gt; ) sorry if this is a bit ranty , but it 's weird to see such places become refugee camps for rich people trying to be cultured . 
  just like london ... yay ... 
  says the canadian ... 
  in all seriousness , certain places should be regulated and other encouraged , if some of those tourists to other ( just as beautiful ) parts of scotland there would n't be a problem . 
  the same is happening in [ the isle of sky ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-40872328/does-the-isle-of-skye-have-too-many-tourists ) oh and bear in mind that only 6 % of chinese have a passport ... yeah , you can see that tourism is gon na become a big issue in the future . 
  i understand their misery . 
  i have to walk past the touristy areas of london every now and then it is almost hillarious a number of people that swarm certain areas of the city . 
  it ` s hard enough catering for tourists in a city large as london , i can understand just how bad it might feel if your city only has a few hundred thousand people living in it rather and a few million . 
  ah what could have been ... 
  that should be the next default windows background .

  interestingly enough the reason most of england is divided up like that was due to [ `` enclosure '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enclosure ) , aka 18th centuary privatisation . 
  all that 's missing are the [ busloads of chinese tourists ...  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-37820663 ), 
  `` your openly sexist and homophobic '' `` but i 'm muslim '' `` sorry , i did n't mean to insult your culture , please carry on '', 
  lower transport costs and more competition i guess edit ; economies of scale may have something to do with it , britain is a much larger market than poland .

  yes but the us is * far * more federalised than the eu , which is something we will want to become if we want to save the euro . 
  `` its more like miami beach '' well , that 's gentrification for you , out with the artists and in with the bankers , like what happened with so many other places over time .

  efficiency is how much you get out compared to how much you put in . 
  is a generator that takes 10pounds of coal and puts out 10 watts is better than one that takes 10pounds and puts out 8 watts . 
  bringing back stability to the meddietan would help as well . 
  gadaffi was not a nice dictator but he was better than pure anarchy .

  i have family near lincoln , and because the surrounding countryside is * extremely flat * whenever you get near you can see the cathedral peaking over the horizon . 
  ah give only that had happened , we would have had a united europe by now . 
  interestingly enough , there was one an actual plan for this to happen . 
  people wanted to create the [ `` imperial federation '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_federation ) which would be one nation state encompassing all of the white canzuk nations with the addition of south africa and possible rhodesia . 
  it did n't go ahead as it was replaced with `` home rule '' , which is a shame `` imperial federation '' sounds way better than `` untied kingdom '', 
  or we could ascend to as a province of canada ... we would keep free trade with the eu , get to have immigration controls and keep the monarchy . 
  but its * multiculturalism !, 
  remove orange ? 
  they are really efficient of destroying things , but not very good at making them ...

  well , they backed an illegal secession attempt within weeks of independence , and when white congolese were the victims of race riots after independence , they sent in paratroopers without the congos permission to help them . 
  it was fine until a ) arab slavers arrived and started , well slaving . 
  b ) king shyam of kuba decided to introduce extraction taxes which began to turn the nation into a machine for giving wealth to the rich . 
  ( see why nations fail for a more comprehensive description ) the congo is so diverse that there never really was a `` good '' or `` bad '' point for the whole country until leopold arrived . 
  im ca n't remember , i think it was a documentary somewhere ... 
  either way i added the 15million figure as an edit to the comment . 
  ok , mobutu impoverished his nation , whilst using its wealth to * private hire concorde , to go on 1-day shopping trips to paris * ironic mobutu love of luxury transportation did not extend to roads , which he allowed to decay , meaning that the congo which had 58,000 miles of road at the time of independence , was left with around 5,000 by the time mobutu was overthrown . 
  also , he used his wealth to , ** buy a chateau overlooking one previously owned and used by leopold ii **, 
  the congo went from arab slavers to belgium colonization to civil war , to corrupt dictatorship , to warlords , and now to chinese exploitation possibly . 
  the congo is also the birthplace of ebola ... and one of the battlegrounds for `` africas world war '' that was the aftermath of the rwandan genocide . 
  congo is also a country where a riot broke out after accusations of witchcraft at a football game ( yes , and that 's not a meme i swear ) quite a sad history. , and it does n't help that the countries ethnic map looks like [ this ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/congo/images/congo-ethnic-2003.jpg ) oh and [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/30/congo-violence-fuels-fears-of-return-to-90s-bloodbath ) kicked of recently ... 
  during the scramble for africa , he made the `` congo free state '' which was basically his own private property . 
  now to make the `` free state '' economy viable he forced the native population to gather him a ridiculous high quota of rubber , and if they failed they would either be killed or have their [ hands cut off , even children . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congo_free_state#/media/file:mutilatedchildrenfromcongo.jpg ) he did this using the `` force publique '' which went around its days terrorizing the local population . 
  the end result ; 2 million africans killed . 
  * this guys crimes were so appalling that the colonial powers coerced the belgium government into stepping in and alleviating the conditions somewhat by taking other the congo . 
  the conditions were so bad that the congo is where apolcapyse nows , father book , the heart of darkness , is based . 
  the sad part is that the congo never was a particularly nice place to being with , he just made is way worse , and when the congo became independent , things just got worse . 
  [ see congo crisis ] to this day the congo is racked by civil war and is one of the poorest states in africa , ( thanks to the us-backed dictator joseph mobutu , but that 's a story for another time ) . 
  sorry for this being so long , i quite a bit about the history of the congo , and believe me it 's not in any way pleasant at most times .
