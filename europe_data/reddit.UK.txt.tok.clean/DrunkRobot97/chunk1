south korea and ireland . 
  the both of you even have a crazy neighbor in the north !, 
  norn iron best iron . 
  it has little thrusters jets surrounding its body , just like the main probe . 
  onboard devices would keep track of pilae 's attitude , and fire the jets to make sure it hits the ground bottom-side down . 
  it would n't * really * be scientists that directly control the probes , actually . 
  the correct term is `` spacecraft operations engineers '' . 
  scientists take the data received from the probes , then tells the soes what they need the probe to do . 
  your comment is about as necessary as mine . 
  says germany 's hat . 
  we 're not trying to make another usa , we 're just trying to keep the countries of europe close , prosperous and stable so that none of us goes crazy and starts another war . 
  that was the primary goal of first the european coal and steel community and then the european economic community , and now the european union . 
  and if people like you keep getting their panties in a twist over words , then we 're going to fail that goal . 
  if you live in a place like north korea , you either need drugs or a * very * well-developed sense of humour to get through the day . 
  that must be the most bitter irony of the modern age . 
  a system that prides itself on betterment through competition is now failing , now that it itself has no competition . 
  the invisible hand is a powerful force , and a good one , all things considered , but we need the state to provide a * moral * axis to the economy ( the laws of supply and demand do n't need to make people happy , politicians facing an election do ) . 
  ** germany ** : i 'm fairly certain you guys have life figured out . 
  you seem to be the team mother of europe , a job i do n't envy you having , but i would n't trust it with anybody else . 
  you pride yourselves in productivity and manufacturing prowess , and that pride is earned . 
  as it turns out , you have very similar humour to that of britain !, 
  i loved * goodbye , lenin !, 
  * , enjoy your jokes , and i would n't mind to see more imports on tv . 
  ( maybe that 's what we should do to bbc three ... ), 
  now , we just get some of our smart , funny people , and you get your sexy people , encourage procreation , and we shall once again conquer the world with our beautiful , hilarious , genius \u00dcbermenschen ... 
  `` we all just like looking at naked , beautiful people . 
  it does n't matter * where * . 
  or * how * ... '', 
  damn it , i 'm supposed to hate you , but my body is being overwhelmed by a strange , gooey feeling . 
  maybe this is what it 's like to be french . 
  alright , i guess i have to return the favor : i respect your nation . 
  for centuries , ireland was never given a break , not even from its closest neighbor . 
  through famine , war and downright occupation by people who loathed you , your country marched on regardless . 
  it could have fallen to chaos long ago , but it did n't . 
  and while we can still bicker at times , and we both face an uncertain future , it 's easier to face it standing beside you . 
  and , i 'll admit , father ted is more irish than it is british .

  `` everything is going according to plan ... '', 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa -- ( smash ), 
  do n't be ridiculous , why bother carrying a picture if a # 5 note could do just fine ? 
  i know i 'm not crazy , that guy at the bottom , next to the beer can , looks exactly like leonardo dicaprio . 
  it 's often referred to in ads and maps as ` derry/londonderry ' ( pronounced ` derry-stroke-londonderry ) . 
  because of that , it also has the name ` stroke city ' . 
  wait . 
  6/3 = 2\u00a09/3 = 3 half-life 2 : episode 3 confirmed !! 1 !, 
  * an analogy to the hoops of logic one must jump through to successfully get offended by a number . 
  the hilux used in the arctic special had a toilet fitted to it . 
  were they making a statement about sanitation in the arctic circle ? 
  i 'm obviously blowing that out of proportion , but top gear has become so edgy that people deliberately try to find ways to be offended by it , even when they are genuinely being innocent . 
  it pisses me off when people who really should have more important things to do attempt to feign ` butthurt ' to get some lawsuit money . 
  top gear is , above all , a comedy programme , and it should be treated as one . 
  norn iron !, 
  ah , now , come on , ted . 
  all that stuff on heaven and hell and everlasting life and all that thing , you 're not actually supposed to take it seriously !, 
  eh , ` pilgrimage ' is the p-word i thought most people associate with s. arabia . 
  `` give 'em a good dose of pilgrimage power ! '', 
  but we * do * say `` what 's the crack ? '' . 
  a lot . 
  ( i 'm northern irish , if my fleg confuses you . ), 
  the [ wieliczka salt mine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wieliczka_salt_mine ) looks pretty cool as well . 
  with the french , it 's not enough to merely launch air-strikes at your enemies , you also have to * piss them off * . 
  saying this is going to make the queen cry , but props to the french on getting deadly on `` daesh '' . 
  the * moon * is going to have a fight for independence before cornwall gets one . 
  `` what is this ? 
  a cartoon character giving a political opinion obviously written for the sake of comedy ? 
  i must take this really seriously , and spread my ideological bullshit ! '', 
  it 's certainly not homogeneous , but european countries , certainly western and northern european countries , share a broad set of ideals , such as democracy , freedom of speech , and the obligations of the government to serve the people , and not the other way around . 
  how `` european '' you are , imo , is how important this set of ideals is to you , and does it surpass the importance of your national identity or not . 
  i might not speak a word of french , but i would rather have a drink with a decent frenchman than a member of the `` english defence league '' who wants all the ` queers and islamists ' shot or thrown out of the country . 
  i 'm having difficulty picturing farage as anything else other than a cartoon villain sucked into the real world to physically drag the british isles into the middle of the atlantic .

  i hope to christ that people that want `` no '' but were n't going to vote would see this and go to the voting booths . 
  we had a really cool ship called * ark royal * a couple centuries ago . 
  when it saw off the spanish armada , it went into the history books , so when the royal navy needed a badass name for one of its first aircraft carriers , * ark royal * felt like it had the * gravitas * . 
  [ the tradition stuck with shiny new carriers getting the name . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_ark_royal ), 
  i did hear talk about renaming the * prince of wales * to the * ark royal * . 
  so that might happen .

  shush , the daily express will hear you . 
  there 's a lot of things you could do with $ 500 billion . 
  we could send a follow-up mission to that comet we 've been chasing and threaten to redirect it towards russia . 
  slightly more seriously , a fund for pan-european superprojects would be amazing . 
  same could be said for many others , such as the united states and russia . 
  that is a magnificent-looking roundabout you have there . 
  trams too . 
  why ca n't britain have more trams ? 
  trams look amazing . 
   anyway you are british , you do n't even consider yourself european , what is it to you ? 
  you speak for half a billion people , but the opinion of one of those people is worth jack-shit to you , on account that he 's british ? 
  hey !, 
  everyone !, 
  come over here , see the guy with the magical crystal ball that tells him how strangers on the internet think !, 
  what the fuck is wrong with you ? 
   what exactly did we expect them to do ? 
  ummmm , * not * invade ukraine ? 
  it 's pretty easy to * not * do something , especially if doing it involves any level of war-making . 
  [ no it was n't . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/british_empire_in_east.png/350px-british_empire_in_east.png ) there had long been talk of carving a ` muslim state ' out of the raj for the large muslim population .
