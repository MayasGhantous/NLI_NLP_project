  the [ hohenzollerns in america ] ( http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4781 ) by stephen leacock describes what they did next . 
  it is our nature to behave like sailors on shore leave when we are abroad . 
  why are the netherlands not in the same pot as germany ? 
  they actively embraced the occupation - hardly any germans were needed to occupy them , the dutch were more than helpful . 
  frankly , the postwar self examination that germany has undergone needs to take place in quite a few european countries . 
  fewer than 4000 people ? 
  tell me , what is the current population of the uk ? 
  [ pantomime ( informally panto ) is a type of musical comedy stage production , designed for family entertainment . 
  it was developed in england and is still performed there , generally during the christmas and new year season and , to a lesser extent , in other english-speaking countries . 
  modern pantomime includes songs , slapstick comedy and dancing , employs gender-crossing actors , and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale , fable or folk tale . 
  [ 1 ] it is a participatory form of theatre , in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers . 
  i have read these comments and based on many of them i feel that i suddenly become more of a ` beleaver ' than a ` remaniac ' . 
  the central plank of the eu ( and the eec before it ) has always been about france and germany . 
  if france and germany agree on something then everyone else can go whistle . 
  if france and germany disagree on anything then france can always get enough votes from spain and italy ( without anyone else ) to get their way . 
  there really is no room in the eu for the uk to ever lead policy etc as we simply do n't have a voting bloc like this - those countries who may naturally agree ( perhaps we could say netherlands , sweden , denmark ) simply do not make enough votes to outvote france/germany or france/italy/spain . 
  frankly , i do not think ` ever closer union ' is anything more than words on a piece of paper - will the eurozone ever really actually have a proper central budget ? 
  will there ever be the entirely sensible european defence force with the massive economy of scale savings this will bring ( alongside france giving up their un security council seat for an eu one ) ? 
  frankly the uk can stay and be a useful scapegoat behind which certain countries can hide their own doubt regarding decisions that are made or the uk can leave and a hundred cracks will appear - not amongst governments perhaps but certainly with national electorates and perhaps us leaving is the healthiest option for all . 
  [ bbc radio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bbc_radio#stations ) output is available worldwide unlike the tv and goes from urban , popular , funk , reggae , classical , jazz , world music , live music and concerts to talk , drama , arts , politics , science , regional - welsh and gaelic language and local county stations , and the bbc world service . 
  absolutely worth the licence fee alone . 
  there are also many middle of the road independent stations and specialist indepedent music stations and shouty talk radio .

  my father who was in the royal navy during the suez crisis has a near east campaign medal . 
  afaik places like yemen , aden egypt are near east , places to the east of this are middle east ... well back in the day anyway .

  and how many schools would there be ? 
  i grew up in a town of a similar size and most people of school age are at least vaguely acquainted . 
  i think foreign office advice is not to go . 
  you can buy a package holiday to each of these countries for 2016 so yeah they are safe .

  trust me , swans do not require any law to protect them . 
  one of the first things i remember being taught is that they can break a man 's arm with one wing . 
  which council ? 
  the one where the are 10 german votes and 3 danish ones ? 
  oh , i did not think his was a widely held opinion . 
  i am very firmly for staying in the eu but i particularly want the development of this [ argument ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/429s7b/eli5_what_reforms_does_the_uk_want_to_remain_in/cz8wa2a ) ... and i agree broadly with [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/429s7b/eli5_what_reforms_does_the_uk_want_to_remain_in/cz8so1o ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that irish citizens have rights in the uk that other europeans do not - including [ benefits , health and voting rights ] ( https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/coming-from-abroad-and-claiming-benefits-the-habitual-residence-test/british-and-irish-citizens-claiming-benefits/ ) as they are part of the common travel area . 
  it 's the inner englishman in him that calls him to get shitfaced drunk ~ ~ in ~ ~ ~ ~ prague ~ ~ abroad . 
   more to the point , why would anybody want to go to sweden/finland/denmark ? 
  and be stuck in some dreary concrete project building somewhere with no chance of ever finding meaningful work , or pretty much any work for that matter , awful food , introverted people that are hard to make friends with , and dark winter 8 months a year . 
  i need convincing that the uk is different from the above description - r/uk gives entirely the correct impression that most of us are miserable bastards living lives of ` quiet desperation ' , our cuisine has a certain reputation and i think i saw something that may have been light when i left work this evening at 17.00 hrs . 
  certainly it was dark when i left home this morning . 
  obviously this would not appear in the russian press - any russian journalist looking at this kind of story would end up [ dead ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia ) .

  istanbul = wood green on sea, 
  note 1 states that there is no data for the uk . 
  which is highly believable ; our foreign language skills are somewhat limited to speaking english sloooowly and loudly when in the company of our european neighbours . 
  fortunately many of you speak english brilliantly . 
   [ ** the values of the union ** ] ( http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/objectives_en.htm#values )  the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  these values , which are set out in article i-2 , are common to the member states . 
  moreover , the societies of the member states are characterised by pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men . 
   these values play an important role , especially in two specific cases . 
  firstly , under the procedure for accession set out in article i-58 , ** any european state wishing to become a member of the union must respect these values in order to be considered eligible for admission ** . 
  secondly , failure by a member state to respect these values may lead to the suspension of that member state 's rights deriving from membership of the union ( article i-59 ) . 
   in comparison with the existing treaties , the constitution has included new values , notably human dignity , equality , the rights of minorities and the characterization of the values upheld by the societies of the member states . 
  * = format, 
  true - however i would choose east germany 1985 over some of these candidates in 2015 ... 
  my point being that they appear from a social point of view to be highly unsuitable societies - corrupt dictatorships etc. 
  the question asked whether i ( or anyone responding to the question ) felt that these countries are a good fit for the union . 
  currently they are absolutely not and i can not see them being ready in 30 years . 
  none of these are countries that i would enjoy living in at the moment - i ca n't see that changing in 30 years frankly . 
  [ caravaggio ] ( http://www.caravaggio-foundation.org/home-1-96-1-1.html ) is undoubtedly the greatest painter who ever lived ( and he certainly lived an interesting life ) . 
  my personal favourite is [ breugel the elder ] ( http://www.pieter-bruegel-the-elder.org/home-1-96-1-1.html ) . 
  in an age when paintings and portraiture were very much about/produced for the rich , his studies of the lives of the peasantry are simply amazing . 
  a copy of [ childrens games ] ( http://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/children-s-games-1560.jpg ) hung outside the head 's office when i was at school and i had a lot of opportunity to study it closely !, 
  i am sure that i have read that it is because in the damp dark north beer etc was not easily preserved so once made it has to be drunk quickly . 
  wine however , available all year round brings a different attitude . 
  i wonder where the french go ? 
  in fact that would be quite an interesting question - `` where do non-redditors go in your country ? '', 
  in the uk i imagine it would be [ mumsnet ] ( http://www.mumsnet.com/talk?call=activeconversations ) or [ digital spy ] ( http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?s=b6248481413a7496fa427baa49881272&amp;f=22 ) or the surprisingly large [ sheffield forum ] ( https://www.sheffieldforum.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=4 ) etc,

  eec was not the eu ... 
  funding is based on how succesful a sport is in an olympics ie how many medals . 
  this makes athletes/rowers/cyclists / swimmers etc etc train to peak during the olympics . 
   maybe young people do n't care but old people are obsessed with it . 
  a lot of the teaching about how shitty the empire was has been whitewashed too . 
  nonsense .

   citizenship is fundamental to the collective self-government involved in democracy . 
  the welfare state is also very dependent on the idea of citizenship . 
   social welfare systems involve taxpayers undertaking to economically support people they do not know . 
  such an undertaking is impossible without the sense of shared identity and solidarity that citizenship provides . 
   the value and sustainability of this sense of solidarity risks being undermined if citizenship is granted to large numbers of people with little real connection to the state . 
   eu free movement rights are a good example of a situation where political and legal problems have been caused by large-scale take up of rights that had previously been used on a smaller scale ... relatively few eu citizens took advantage of the right to live in any eu state until the accession of the post-communist countries in 2004 . 
   as the uk 's decision to leave the eu shows , the large-scale use by citizens of these states of free movement rights made those more controversial than before . 
  it has also put pressure on the rights that go with free movement . 
  i can think of very few that are not absolutely gorgeous . 
  god , you sound like an insufferable , whining berk . 
  my heart always sinks when i read that most pompous of introductions `` i am english/british , here are my uniquely special insights '' . 
  as for your message - this is r/europe - i would n't be taking the gleeful schadenfreude on here to heart - you might as well take polandball seriously . 
  not even a polite no !, 
  well i am now conflicted . 
  i have always thought of bhl as a bit of a berk .
