  ` deeply religious ' . 
  where , other than the fact that her father was a c of e vicar , are you getting ` deeply ' religious from ? 
  i do n't know what , if anything , you know about the c of e but we are not talking about some bloodthirsty fundamentalists here . 
  well , this following on from the griffin endorsement is the kiss of death .

  i am not going to disagree with your valid point . 
  however , france is not alone in glossing over their role regarding jewish oppression/extermination at that time . 
  there are a few countries in europe who have not until recently if at all undergone the kind of self-examination that germany has . 
  her point would be that the true french government was in exile and the vichy government does not count . 
  to be fair to this ghastly woman , why the fuck is this relevant ? 
  she is quite right , the people who did this at that time are the ones who are responsible . 
  this sub and the guardian etc fall down foaming at the mouth if people try to equate modern day germany and her politicians with those times , rightly so . 
  sorry , you appeared to be agreeing with him/her , so i assumed you read and would be able to show examples of these comments on articles .

  they are all about freedom of information as per the importance of decisions being taken closely as possible to the citizen in the context of access to official documents by the citizenry .

  you do understand that various [ exporting sectors ] ( http://www.cityam.com/259082/now-german-businesses-calling-post-brexit-partnership-uk ) throughout europe are considering the impact of the loss of a 60 million person market and the impact it will have on them ? 
  fallout from brexit if the kind of spiteful tone you seem to have adopted will be europewide and benefit no one . 
  personally i voted pragmatic remain - the arguments against the status quo were not at all persuasive . 
  however , i was around before 1973 and whilst the coming years will be interesting i do predict the world will not end . 
  in the context of 1952 in which an exhausted continent had fought two horrendous wars the idealism of the eec as opposed to the practicalities of it , was and is intended promote trust and understanding among peoples living in open and democratic societies . 
  in the consolidated version of the treaty on european union , the phrase ` ever closer union ' is [ revisited ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:c:2012:326:full:en:pdf#page=18 ) :  resolved to continue the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of europe , in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen the phrase is and always has been symbolic and not at all political . 
  naturally this has not stopped politicians throughout the eu using it politically , either as a positive or a negative . 
  [ german farmers seek continued access to uk food market post brexit ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-germany-agriculture-idukkbn15329u ) anyone who does n't think that every industrial sector in germany and other eu exporting countries is not having this kind of conversation with their governments misunderstands the world . 
   determined to lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of europe peoples , not governments . 
  eec vs eu is the difference . 
   catalog of names allowed to be given to babies why would this be a thing ? 
  oh please . 
  this was clearly a jokey remark . 
  is the eu ( or rather it 's cheerleaders on reddit ) really so fragile ? 
  but , those ` come to bed ' [ eyes ] ( http://tennisnerd.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/b1goat001.jpg ) ... 
   to date , the prime minister , theresa may , has refused to guarantee the rights of eu citizens in the uk until those of uk citizens living in europe are also guaranteed . 
  seems reasonable . 
  had a heated debate about this today . 
  actually living in the south west and working with a mix of devon and cornish people this is pretty much a weekly debate , round about teatime on a friday . 
  myself i do the jam first . 
  when recently asked by the bbc why he was interested in moving to brussels , malloch replied : `` i had in a previous career a diplomatic post where i helped bring down the soviet union . 
  so maybe there 's another union that needs a little taming . '' clearly joking . 
  there have been overseas ( mostly east european ) seasonal agricultural workers for decades before the uk joined the eec/eu . 
  the saws scheme started in 1945 and only stopped in 2013 . 
  it allowed seasonal workers to reside in the uk specifically for this work . 
  to be fair this is pretty much how the uk goes about everything . 
  true , but i feel this is illustrative of the discussions with national governments various trade , industry and business associations will be having in germany , france , italy , poland etc whilst the same governments are trying to show a united eu front in negotiations . 
  national interest vs federal interest - which will win ? 
  i am not a fan of this woman or her party but i am pretty sure that anywhere else in northern europe other than france , mitterand , chirac and sarkozy would be in prison now .

  nonsense . 
  yes , actually said it to the trumpanzee directly in a phone call . 
  i was not aware that the uk has withdrawn from the paris agreement ? 
  it implies that you are purchasing things that cost one pound and of course many supermarkets of the tesco express size upwards have self-service tills . 
  utter , utter nonsense . 
  where the fuck are you shopping , waitrose ? 
  even there you can buy a kilo of potatoes for a pound and certainly prices at the likes of tesco etc are nothing like you are claiming . 
  also of course , buying fruit and veg at a market or greengrocer is cheaper still . 
  fat fucks are fat because they eat shit and spend their leisure time on their lardy arses . 
  part of the problem in the uk is that people clearly do no know how to shop for fresh food and cook healthy meals from scratch . 
  you are never going to convince me that people are eating crap and becoming fat fucks because it is cheaper than proper cooking . 
  renewable energy industry is doing quite well in the uk with initial help and encouragement from central government without immediate obligate targets . 
  this approach is successful in that it gives time for r & d , exploration of the different ways to skin a cat as seen by the links i offered . 
  whilst we are speaking frankly , i do not give two fucks for your clearly ill-informed opinion of my country and our successful approach to renewable energy in harmony with private enterprises from among others danish and german engineering interests . 
  no one has suggested doing nothing and thank you for addressing the points i have made so clearly . 
  setting unachievable targets that do not have the support of all the groups responsible for reaching said target is foolish . 
  encouragement to industry and services some of which will have to address the effects on business , jobs , investment etc is just as important and over-regulation along with onerous targets will affect the prosperity of everyone . 
  you will note that the article mentions the divide between the poorer countries to the east and west eu countries regarding this . 
  clearly the eu has learned from a variety of issues over the past few years , that dragging the poorer countries into agreements that they are either not ready for or can afford is the path to success ...
