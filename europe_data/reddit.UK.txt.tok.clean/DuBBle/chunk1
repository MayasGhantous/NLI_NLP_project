you 're silly . 
  nice , but i think you mean [ pompey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pompey ) not [ pompei ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pompeii ) . 
  thanks mate . 
  i managed to infer an answer to my question from your previous comment , but i always appreciate clarification . 
  to reiterate : in every circumstance , additional reassurance is of assistance to me . 
  huh . 
  i had n't realised that was a concept used in ww1 , or was it from ww2 and the url is just misleading ? 
  why is the global recession not affecting switzerland ? 
  i 'm highly skeptical about the merits of accepting this wave of migrants , but this kind of hyperbole and feel-good-lying has to stop . 
  defeat your detractors with facts . 
  volkswagen have their own fest - and i hear it 's been under-rated . 
  i have to condemn someone criticising france - and it 's all your fault . 
  people are saying ` you need to shake off that apologetic nature ' but i respect it . 
  thanks for being self-critical , saxon-bro . 
  i 'd not thought of it like that . 
  they * have * paid , and suffered , and endured . 
  it explains the sense of entitlement . 
  the problem is that they 've not paid the people from whom they expect significant support . 
  one direction ( north-west ) i tried , / u/jarvis400 - why you got ta be so mean ? 
  could n't the brits have just * borrowed * the fleet until the whole nasty business was over ? 
  ` mining town ' is synonymous with ` no jobs ' in the uk nowadays . 
  i do n't think there 's much of an immigrant connection . 
  you can come to tea , but you must stay near the pond and arrange in advance so that there wo n't be candles . 
  if you were looking for a synonym for ` destroying ' then ` smashing ' would be good . 
  if you meant ` criticising ' or ` insulting ' then ` bashing ' is the word for you !, 
  i can almost agree , but some silly hindus send flaming balloons up over residential areas during their festivals . 
  if you can concede to this caveat then you can come to tea and meet my mum . 
  i met one - but he was clearly having a terrible day , and he was drunk , and he was in hospital , and he was under arrest . 
  how 's the new guy doing anyway ? 
  any progress on convincing the sunnis they 're not 2nd-class citizens or clamping down on corruption ? 
  hey cousin !, 
  want to cross international boundaries without formal documentation with me ? 
  you do n't recognise the importance but still conducted independent research . 
  you 're good people . 
  thanks for the raw footage - that 's the first i 've seen of it . 
  bbc radio 4 is still stating that `` apparently '' it was a fall as a result of overcrowding - last time i listened (  24 hrs ago ) . 
  no need to apologise !, 
  your gastein is very good - for a non-native speaker !, 
  look at me - i 'm from ( very near ) middlesbrough - the frenchman is correct . 
  no - the bike section was two isles down . 
  when it comes to western slavs , to seek the truth you do not ` follow the money ' but ` the cars ' . 
  i wonder if the mods would be okay with allowing a duplicate post some time ( duplicate link , different title ) , so that users could have their biases revealed in a later self-post ? 
  how did the lifestyle emerge ? 
  they sound utterly irish but act so distinctly unique . 
  i know of a gypsy kid who describes himself as ` irish ' - despite being born in england , living in a caravan , owning horses , other stereotypes etc. 
  i just do n't understand how the nomadic idea became so entangled with irishness . 
  i do n't think they 're talking about wwiii - just some hypothetical where - in a fit of nostalgia - germany decides to invade belgium . 
  op is from sudan , 
  i 'm not sure why you 're being downvoted . 
  if the officially-recognised libyan government were supported militarily in return for a ) policing their borders and b ) giving humane treatment to refugees - perhaps inlcuding an assessment-process to determine if a refugee would be welcome in libya or any european country - i think we 'd be on our way to ending this crisis . 
  come to think of it , does the med ` flush-out ' into the atlantic ? 
  in which case , the east coast of gibraltar must be harvesting a horrible bounty every high-tide . 
  it 's not your fault , op , but a bit of a shitty headline . 
  one recent poll puts the ` no ' vote ahead . 
  the article even reports a contradictory poll , but does n't alter the title to reflect it . 
  the current aggregate [ looks like this ] ( http://predictwise.com/politics/uk-politics ) according to predictwise . 
  ... they said . 
  oh - ` the queen ' is our friendly name for the fish-and-chip shop owner down the street . 
  this is way beyond my level . 
  i 've requested an audience with the queen . 
  well , you would say that !, 
  i 'm pretty sure / u/99xp was being sarcastic . 
  as a brit - i claim authority over such matters . 
  what do we have to be defensive about ? 
  absolutely nothing - so shut up !, 
  you should be more specific . 
  bucharest , bra\u0219ov and constan\u021ba are in ` the eastern part ' and they 're doing fine . 
  ever seen a duck dick, 
  i 'm bringing my tourism money to romania this year - partly because of their impressive recent anti-corruption efforts . 
  please fleece me gently . 
  * i really should go to norway . 
  you 'd use ` went ' to say , ' i went to norway ' - past perfect singular . 
  the spanish - they 're bullish when running and papal but austro flocks exercise lutheran at table, 
  spanish , or habsburg ? 
  are you going to let / u/larelli get away with calling you that ? 
  i * knew * the division was a terrible game . 
  thanks for the data . 
  thanks , portugal . 
  thortugal . 
  i went on holiday to the beautiful city of moscow last week , and i tell you , i could barely queue in peace for a metro train because of all the ... oh . 
  we should n't mock - the development of satellite techniques helps to increase the defense capability . 
  it would be easier to have a / ns tag when it comes to brits on reddit . 
  but yes - i 'm keen on mutual punishment . 
  thanks . 
  that helps !, 
  i would have sympathy , but i 'm trying to learn romanian and just came across , ` pot s\u0103 merg pe jos p\u00e2n\u0103 acolo ? ' . 
  if your people ca n't find a simpler way to ask , ` can i walk there ? 
  ' , they deserve a life playing ` wonderwall ' outside liverpool street station . 
  what 's your point ? 
  are you at all worried that it will be ' 2020s : massive earthquake ' ? . 
  i read that the area north of bucharest is really seismically active . 
  are your dudes prepared ? 
  i need a romanian, 
  the best thing about being labelled a nazi is that you get to label everyone else . 
  i 'm not even sure if i 'm spelling the name right . 
  did you say [ goldman sachs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goldman_sachs ) ? 
   miss use i confess , this would have got a downvote from me if i had n't known you were from australian indonesia . 
  it 's ` misuse ' btw :p, 
  we are always looking for capable administrators . 
  poland can into parking space .
