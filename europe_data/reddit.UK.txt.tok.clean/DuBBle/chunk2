  you 're right . 
  it does seem to be quite rare , globally . 
  any others for the list , or can england join you in some self-depricating triumverate ? 
  i often see romanians on this site poking fun at their own country . 
  is that normal for romanians as a whole ? 
  i really admire it . 
  good to see some lithuanian humour around here . 
  i 'll not allow wooshes against non-native speakers . 
  would n't it be france , as loyal defenders of the british crown ? 
  also there was that business with normans/french invading ireland ( at the request of an irish king ? ), 
  - setting us up for all this kerfuffle in the first place . 
  can i get a source on that ? 
  what 's the political-correctness situation like in romania ? 
  i 'd quite like to move there , and it would be a bonus to escape this nonsense . 
  ` events completing between 13 january 2012 and now ' . 
  great explanation !, 
  may your loins be fruitful . 
  like [ this ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03267/fatwoman_3267110b.jpg ) ? 
  that might be where the ` soon ... ' meme started . 
  interesting . 
  what was it , then ? 
  surely it was in a group of countries along with east germany , poland , czechoslovakia , etc ? 
  do we simply say that these countries had communist governments supported by the ussr ? 
  are the super speeds only available in towns ? 
  the romanian countryside can be sound of music beautiful , but it would all be spoiled if you could n't download hearthstone in < 1min . 
  after we 've got this war on terror wrapped up , we really need to deal with these deviants . 
  yes - there 's no way i 'm visiting sweden since they burned down the g\u00e4vle goat . 
  did you know that , in the spanish version , he 's not from barcelona ? 
  i ca n't remember where he 's from instead . 
  stop expecting so much from me . 
  of course !, 
  thanks , germany !, 
  they certainly have a narrow agenda . 
  i would n't call it ` trolling ' because that would require cunning - like the bear of \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0441 . 
  not to dismiss / u/perinealperturbation 's words based on posting history alone - they 've given us plenty of other reasons to be dismissive - but you 're talking to a 20-day-old account who only posts about russia . 
  there 's britbong , but it 's only available at certain times . 
  does anyone know why austria has 3 ` adversarial ' tables near the front - with two chairs facing one another ? 
  looks like they 're preparing for a chess tournament . 
  when you [ compare the number ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries ) of people killed by police in the us against the same figures globally , it becomes apparent that the general armament of populace and police is a very bad idea . 
  i understand the ` citizen militia ' and ` personal liberty ' arguments , but sheer pragmatism seems to have won out in the uk on at least this issue . 
  it affects people who use the underground . 
  source : affects me . 
  a spot of googling has revealed that iraq changes its flag seemingly to suit the season - what 's that all about ? 
  are they commieblocks in the middle-east ? 
  soviet-funded ? 
  i ask because we have some hideous tower blocks in the uk , but we designed them all by ourselves . 
  * resigned sucking noises *, 
  oh - i see where you got confused !, 
  this subreddit has a pragmatic consensus on the refugee issue , and you 've mistaken that for genuine racism . 
  the idiocy you just spouted is entirely understandable . 
  vatican city ? 
  the college of cardinals are not citizens , are they ? 
  dude also misspelled ` borders ' in his original post . 
  it 's not looking good . 
  would n't that make them non-voters , / u/anal _ mcdick_rape ? 
  true , but we prefer dictatorships who do n't upset the boat . 
  how did the revenues increase so much ? 
  is it mostly due to east germany having lots of room for improvement ? 
  i remember having to queue in cairo and pay some kind of ` fee ' for a stamp that the authorities called a visa - back in the mubarak days . 
  do russians get to skip this ? 
  let 's try to keep this civil . 
  imagine typing with your fingers crossed . 
  skillfully typed !, 
  i suppose it helps in times of war , 
  ireland is also that colour . 
  silly labeling system . 
  double-headed black eagle . 
  you certainly educated [ this oriental ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150601071950/plantsvszombies/images/3/3f/dam_son.jpg ) . 
  you have authority and prominence . 
  like it or not - you are an example for us all . 
  awful response , especially from a mod . 
  simple disagreement without explanation adds nothing to the discussion . 
  i miss my noble savages :'(, 
  i think you should have italicised ` go ' and left ` just ' alone . 
  i 'll have trouble sleeping tonight . 
  i think most of those players are brazilian , but maybe a few are portuguese - so i take your point . 
  that 's it . 
  we 're exiting the continent and we 're taking the atlanteans with us . 
  [ you smart ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll9nfnldlii ) etc. 
  guys , can you please look at his link or [ this one ] ( http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-promise-2016/critic-reviews ) before downvoting the flag . 
  contentious flags need to stick together , 
  * restore 4 health to each hero . 
  you 're certainly not wrong , but - in a forum where we 're encouraged to ` flag-up ' - i do n't think it 's helpful to make an unrelated ad-hominem when someone is trying to make a point . 
  even if the israeli chap was a hypocrite - that would n't make his argument any less valid . 
  your comment 's bad and you should feel bad . 
  thing is , if a sales-person over-promises or * outright lies * , many countries have regulations in place to punish their behaviour . 
  perhaps we need to enlist salespeople to get their own back . 
  you give one of paper against [ four of coin ] ( https://youtu.be/dxj8bquyti0?t=21s ) . 
  i did n't do any of those things . 
  if you 're saying that i could have made more of an effort to fight a conservative majority , or spoken out against nigel farage - okay , that 's true . 
  this does n't mean that i approve of my country 's actions , and it certainly does n't mean that , `` they wo n't really want to come here anyway '' - which was the point of my first reply . 
  you 're aware that 48.1 % - or 16,141,241 people - voted remain ? 
  if you want to assume anything about the uk , assume that we 're divided on this topic . 
   cars  casually strolling eastern europe is a strange place . 
  the greek bailouts were paid for largely through the european stability mechanism , in euros , so ` we ' did n't pay for it , unless you 're referring to private debt or imf loans - which would occur regardless of our eu membership . 
  totally anecdotal , but i think there 's a subsection of leave voters who genuinely thought ` leave ' equalled ` immigrants out , now ' . 
  i suppose the violence partly reflected this ` policy ' taking effect , and partly can be explained by idiots solving problems in their age-old way . 
  eu fishing quotas will no longer apply . 
  there 's more than one fishing town in the uk . 
  whitby serves as an example of wider trend in the kind of locations listed [ here ] ( https://www.visitengland.com/things-to-do/harbours-and-fishing-villages ) .
