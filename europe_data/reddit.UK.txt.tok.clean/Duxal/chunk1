ah , a realistic proposal, 
  get well soon xoxo, 
  * ahem * , excuse me , it 's called `` great '' to distinguish it from either ireland or brittany , both of which have been called britain throughout history . 
  zimbabwe was the breadbasket of africa before mugabe 's monumental and ongoing fuck-up . 
  do n't think of just the sahara when you think of africa . 
  i 'm sure he will stop white south africans from coming in too . 
  let me guess , you do n't live in northern ireland . 
  we watch it ironically , to make sure that our gripes about block voting are still relevant . 
  it is of course block voting that explains the uk 's poor results , nothing else , nope , nuh uh, 
  off-topic but i ca n't help but read regina as `` re-gi-na '', 
  i know , i liked that . 
  chicken . 
  that 's scandinavia . 
  why is lithuania the most affected , compared to estonia and latvia ? 
  does russia import more/different products from them ? 
  but not homolove, 
  so where 's the problem ? 
  britain 's family-recognition score is lowered because a part of its country has an inequality , just like how germany 's anti-discrimination laws score is lowered by l\u00e4nder that do n't have them . 
  the island is britain , the country is the united kingdom . 
  northern ireland is currently part of the united kingdom . 
  lack of gay marriage in northern ireland . 
  i think it 's the final 3 % the uk needs for a perfect score in family recognition . 
  you literally named an unequal circumstance in your comment . 
  [ this chart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilga-europe#rainbow_europe ) breaks down each individual score . 
  if a gay man is attacked for his iphone , that 's not a hate crime . 
  if a gay man is attacked after leaving a gay club , and his attacker uses homophobic slurs , that 's a hate crime . 
  hate crimes serve to threaten and distress other members of that community into silence and submission . 
  this map was actually done before the recent civil-unions law , so croatia 's score will increase a lot in may 2015 . 
  azerbaijan is part of [ guam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guam_organization_for_democracy_and_economic_development ) . 
  what would i use them for ? 
  where would i go ? 
  * france * ? 
  hahaaaaa !, 
  haha , it does make me feel a bit inadequate because i do n't know much french outside of `` bonjour , ca va ? '', 
  and `` salle de bain '' . 
  i got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone * i got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone *, 
   every single day i try to keep myself from being a dick to pro-putin russians why ? 
  oh my fucking god, 
  that 's a parody site mate . 
  i thought it was an homage to the european court of human rights . 
  does n't hungary have civil/registered partnerships for same-sex couples though ? 
  so you 've no more knowledge on the situation than / r/bearmodule or i , but somehow your information is right and his is wrong ? 
  do you know the family intimately ? 
  i know , homophobia is awful :(, 
  i thought it was slovakia, 
  perhaps we 'll see reconciliation with iran . 
  the alleged nuclear-weapons development will probably be put on the back-burner to ensure access to iran 's oil and gas supplies . 
  does anyone * really * care about iranian nuclear-weapons capability , anyway ? 
  nothing wrong with that , obviously her dress fell open when she was accosted by that ragamuffin, 
  lads on tour , lads on tour , lads on toooouuuur, 
  like when greece pushed for cyprus ' entry ? 
  freedom house gave them a 1/1 for civil liberties and political rights , a perfect score , the highest score in africa and better than some eu members . 
  obviously it would need * lots * of economic growth and there would be concerns about illegal immigration from senegal ( although none more than there are about italy and malta ) . 
  it probably wo n't happen but it is nice to think about . 
  it 's nice to find out that i 'm not the only person who would like to see cabo verde in the eu . 
  i ca n't help it , it 's my natural inclination for dry humour and sarcasm !, 
  yay !, 
  good for us !, 
  luxembourg is a financial haven that only has like 25 people and 40 sheep so i 'm sure malta will do just fine . 
   we will be the only english speaking member state malta ? 
  is `` insane asylum '' a pun in this context ? 
  i feel a real affinity for the french whenever an american starts mocking you lot . 
  who told them they could get in on our thousand-year love/hate relationship ? 
  that picture of fish and chips has me hankering for a chicken tikka masala . 
  what the fuck * is * cultural marxism anyway, 
   i know the uk only decriminalized gay sex in the 80s england & wales legalised it in 1967 , scotland in 1980 , and northern ireland in 1981 after the european court of human rights struck down the ban ( * dudgeon v united kingdom * ) . 
  i do n't use gibberish , i use real italian words , like `` pizza '' , `` tagliatelle '' and `` berlusconi '' . 
  if that 's terrible english , you do n't want to read my italian . 
  you can leave school at 16 but only if you 're doing an apprenticeship , training course , job , etc. 
  was/is this a common problem in russia ? 
  i resemble that remark !, 
  i thought muslims were insular , did n't integrate and only spoke durkadurkanese ? 
  erm ... why exactly ? 
  i 'm not jewish , but why the fuck should jewish people in australia or brazil or canada have to concern themselves with the affairs of some other jewish people they do n't know ( and probably will never know ) ? 
  really ? 
  all of those photos with his breasts out riding and killing animals do n't smack of insecurity to you ? 
  conchita did this, 
  just me , in charge of myself . 
   russia  superpower lel, 
  ask the un . 
  they gave the ussr 's security council seat to russia . 
  i 've always called it `` drop-calling '' . 
  i think luxury means non-necessity in this context rather than gourmet . 
  i agree , losing india was a major blow to us . 
  tony blair was born in scotland but was mp for [ sedgefield ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sedgefield_\\ ( uk_parliament_constituency \\ ) ) in county durham . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1907  ... an arms embargo on eritrea , travel bans on its leaders , and froze the assets of some of the country 's political and military officials ... 
  although that was because of alleged funding of al-shabaab , not for human rights abuses . 
   russia  recognising other countries as having sovereignty and the right to self-determination ha ha ha ha, 
  haha , it was a joke . 
  no judge is elected in the uk either but that does n't stop people attacking the ecthr ( which is n't even an eu institution ! ) . 
  `` emulsified high-fat offal tube '' - also known as a `` sausage '' - is a joke from [ yes minister ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yes_minister ) - about european regulations/directives ( many of which are printed in tabloids and usually either very manipulated or just not real ) . 
  nick clegg ( as well as neil kinnock and catherine ashton , among others ) is usually accused of being pro-eu so he can collect his grand eu pension after he loses his seat next year . 
  err , umm , unelected judges !, 
  emulsified high-fat offal tube !, 
  nick clegg !, 
  http://www.politicalcompass.org/facebook/pcgraphpng.php?ec=0.62&amp;soc=-7.69 i 've slipped into the economic right since i last took the test about six months ago . 
  i 've always hated the fact that there 's no do n't know/middle option . 
  i much prefer iced tea to tea . 
  can two old people marry ? 
  can two infertile people marry ?
