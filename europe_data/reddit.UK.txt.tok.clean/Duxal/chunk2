  getting it now will be more difficult . 
  i agree , which is why i assume you call [ this animal ] ( http://kids.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/animal_class_hero/giraffe2.jpg ) a camelopard and never use `` egregious '' to mean `` very bad '' . 
  [ martha ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jwgfzv3i3je/uyfvl2yzuvi/aaaaaaaaani/-mz5zu7mmiu/s1600/martha-jones-doctor-who-for-whovians-28291043-240-246.jpg ) ? 
  `` coloured people '' ? 
  [ fuck off , racist scum . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21603056-britain-becoming-less-racist-not-more-pride-and-prejudice ), 
  i think it 's the place missionaries go when they die . 
  damn french . 
  they ruined france !, 
  take your ballot and draw a giant cock and balls on it . 
  and a giant vulva , too , to be equal . 
  portugal 's 1974 revolution was signalled by its eurovision entry . 
  that 's quite historical . 
  well now that would n't be eurovision , would it ? 
  yes . 
  i 've decided to get on the islamic al-bandwagon while it 's still an underground movement . 
  when it goes mainstream , i 'll look like a faker . 
  i assume because they 're fearful that russia will continue its fuckery in other parts of the country . 
  they might also want to go to poland because it has a functioning economy and is n't months/weeks/days / hours away from bankruptcy . 
  i assume s/he means powerful/wealthy . 
  i 'm getting fucked either way ; at least i 'll enjoy it up my arse . 
  shit , if the government paid for an apartment in san francisco for me , i 'd happily call gayism a disability . 
  ireland , the uk and sweden were the only three in 2004 . 
  since when ? 
  have you been sleeping since the '80s ? 
  i 'm literally being forced to listen to my beautiful dark twisted fantasy every day . 
  algeria did n't stay in the eu when it gained independence ( although idk whether that was from choice or ineligibility ) . 
  but can you see why telling an irish person what irishness is could be seen as insulting ? 
  ... which you said yourself does n't include ireland ? 
   ireland is still fairly homogeneous and very new to mass immigration . 
  i gather from your other comments you 're french . 
  i would never tell you how french people should feel about their nationality or culture , so why do you say the same about irish people ? 
  have mercy on the poor seppo, 
  how can you say  i do n't think an irish person can fully understand my side and then ? 
   i feel like it 's very assumptious of him to call himself irish . 
  i think many would and should take offence to that . 
  if you 're not irish , how can you speak on irish peoples ' views on ethnicity , culture and heritage ? 
  why would n't multiple rapes be recorded multiple times ? 
  london gives me palpitations . 
  york 's alright . 
  good to hear . 
   we 're not brushing their bullshit under the rug and pretending it does n't exist haha , ok, 
  elizabeth warren is as cherokee as the [ president of the cherokee nation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bill_john_baker ) . 
  instead , let 's rely on energy that affects nature 's whims . 
  these people are n't clairvoyants , they were n't aware that their livelihoods were going to vanish . 
   nai : yes oh, 
  gross national product, 
  straight people `` shove '' their relationships in everyone 's face all the time . 
  disneylandworld and crazy people too, 
  i guess they think putin is the best of a bad bunch ? 
  pls post headshot, 
  huh ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  sex is both fun and necessary to have children , who will help you when you 're working and care for you when you 're old . 
  development and women 's liberation pretty much always precede a low fertility rate . 
  smashing corruption , improving infrastructure and distributing contraception/family planning guidance is a surefire way to see stable populations . 
  is holding hands with your same-sex partner `` bragging '' ? 
  so you 're an authoritarian libertarian ? 
  cool . 
   analize we 're having that one as well kthx, 
  intersex, 
  that is a sham marriage and was already illegal long before same-sex marriage . 
  less european than turkey ? 
  i hope you stretched before that reach . 
  she 's white passing . 
  besides her name , there is no indication that she has non-white british heritage . 
  bitch you 're white !, 
  i do n't follow japanese or korean politics , especially with regards to immigration , and i ca n't imagine many people in europe do either . 
  and then what ? 
  the children are burdened as adults with their careers , the raising of their own children and the caring of their parents ? 
  did n't part of it collapse though ? 
  is that fixed now ? 
  omg i did n't know lukashenko was on reddit, 
  * was *, 
  liberal democracies protect the rights of minorities as well as majorities , so court rulings legalising same-sex marriage * are * democratic . 
  my theory of choice has to be the de-leading of petrol . 
  do you support the idea of an unelected judiciary at all then ? 
  did a picture of zayn malik accidentally get into this album ? 
  i do n't know if it 's common but i do it because otherwise i get really sweaty . 
  i feel like this is a finnish joke we 've all missed . 
  he gets no respect . 
  no respect !, 
  it 's here , it just does n't hover and will probably explode . 
  there are a lot of colours here , what 's going on ? 
  was n't kennedy from the vatican ? 
  two sides of the same coin ? 
  being gay in russia - at least , being openly gay - does require bravery and confidence . 
  [ a 1996 ifop poll says 48 % of french respondents supported gay marriage then , with 33 % opposed . 
  this definitely was not the majority opinion in france in 2000 . 
   everyone was supposed to marry a woman even the women ? 
  i believe it, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_family_structures_study almost no-one of any note takes it seriously . 
  you 're actually using mark regnerus as a source ? 
  do you think it will pass ? 
   greece remains the last eu state after latvia not to recognise same-sex unions . 
  pretty sure that 's not true . 
  love a bit of helene fischer, 
  ... that 's the joke . 
  that 's the theory , at least . 
  the threshold [ has been upheld ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yumak_and_sadak_v_turkey ) by the european court of human rights , although i think 5 % should probably be the highest acceptable threshold in the eu .
