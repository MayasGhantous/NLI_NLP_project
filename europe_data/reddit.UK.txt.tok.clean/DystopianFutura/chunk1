well futura is a german font , so it think it says more about the eu 's future than it does britain 's :p, 
  many reasons but the biggest is that i do n't want the uk to be too closely tied to a deeply integrated eu and i felt us leaving was inevitable as the main objections to the current membership terms would likely never have been addressed and we as a nation were never fully on board with the european project ( the entire remain argument was n't so much pro-eu as it was anti-having to leave ) , so better to do it now than when we 're even closer . 
  for what it 's worth i 'm a [ pro single market brexiteer ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/r1fdet3 ) and want to prevent the british economy becoming too reliant on the rest of europe . 
  tl ; dr : `` sovereignty '', 
  custard creams, 
  i feel european and voted leave , ama, 
  yeah , good point , but they sound similar enough that i 'm not surprised `` expat '' has basically replaced `` emigrant '' the point is it 's not used because of british exceptionalism or anti-immigrant rhetoric , as is often implied . 
  personally i do n't see this , i regularly see low income brits abroad still called expats and high income immigrants call themselves immigrants . 
  honestly the only thing i think when i see the word `` expat '' is `` someone is going to moan about that word '', 
  why do people make such a big deal about this ? 
  do other languages not have different words for `` someone who moved here '' and `` someone who moved away '' ? 
  i 'm still bitter remain did n't call themselves britin, 
  i was talking about the scottish people rather than the snp , i 've edited my post to make that clear, 
  that 's exactly what it is , scotland was voting on : - remaining in the eu as part of the second largest country rather than being in as a small country - keeping permanent opt outs to multiple things - having barely any immigration compared to england & wales - next to zero leave campaigning - tactical voting ( nationalists vote yes hoping for this situation/unionists vote yes hoping the entire uk stays to avoid it ) leave had every disadvantage in scotland but still managed nearly 40 % . 
  i really ca n't see an independent scotland joining anything more than efta , the scots just are n't the dedicated europhiles the snp are pretending they are . 
  this is n't about the eu , if the uk voted remain the snp would have eventually started shouting about another great betrayal . 
  i wonder how you 'd have felt if they said `` scottish architecture '', 
  just reading that kinda annoyed me , do n't know how you guys deal with people calling it the other name . 
   dont be so sure about that we 've made it clear they can leave whenever they like  eu immigration to the uk its preferential movement it 's literally called `` free movement of people ''  its not 100 % guaranteed that a eu citizen is allowed to stay in the uk correct , but the number who fail to meet the minimum requirement are low and our track record at moving them along is even lower , i did n't trust future governments to govern us in the eu in a way i 'd like  if you think for one sec that immigration will be stopped/lowered post brext deal then boy i got news for you it 's about wanting to control the immigration , not necessarily about wanting to lower it, 
  just fyi the irish do n't like it when you call our islands that , british-irish isles is better, 
  that 's impressive !, 
  was hoping you guys would take a go at it after seeing scotland 's . 
  i do n't think they 'd started when i posted that, 
   48 % were still using the old script and causing this absolute monstrosity bloody unpatriotic remain voters are ruining this country !, 
  the downside of having the world 's greatest flag is the difficulty it is to draw on mmo pixel games . 
   all most every country in world does this big difference between free and preferential movement  the uk in the eu is to insure germany well does n't take over but we really have n't done much to stop franco-german dominance of the eu , partially because we 've sent eurosceptics to the parliament and also because we 're not in the schengen area or eurozone  you could always ya know just give the north back really is up to them , and they seem happy where they are , do n't let it get you down , plenty more fish in the sea , 
  difficulty of flag-building on / r/place is probably the only thing hardline eurofederalists and british eurosceptics can agree on . 
   could of always controlled eu immigration it 's * very * limited control , personally i 'd prefer an immigration system that does n't discriminate based on country of origin  your going leaves us in a bit of pickle yes , we 're sorry about that , but unfortunately we have to pursue our own future in the same way ireland does , both the uk and eu have identified keeping the border with the north open , and we have the common travel area which the uk has no interest in ending , ultimately ireland is cared about by both sides and i believe we 'll attempt to make brexit as easy as we can on our neighbour . 
   you have me there its a new one not all leave voters are ignorant xenophones   i just think the only clear cut winners of brext are the eus enemies i disagree , the eu and uk will still work together , and now the eu will likely find itself a bit more efficient without their most eurosceptic member , the eu is losing a grumpy housemate , but gaining a friendly neighbour . 
   we will never forgot what yours did to our people never said you should or would  as does america as well as others around the world err , not sure how that is relevant  the value in working with others towards a common goal as i said , we 'll still work together  nope we where united in common values and a better tomorrow the eu 's motto is `` united in diversity '' , that 's why i said it , the diversity in governance will grow a bit , but we 'll still be able to work despite our differences  do understand ireland can not align itself with the uks interests any longer we often find our interests are aligned , as we do with the rest of europe , you need to stop looking at this as a battle , we can divorce amicably and remain close allies . 
  exactly , which is why remain lost , they said `` reform '' until they were blue in the face but we knew nothing was going to change if we stayed . 
  well , i voted leave , so i 'm not too sad , but i understand how this is a blow to those with a romantic view of european unity , however we 're not going anywhere , we 'll still be that grumpy island across the irish sea you know and love ( it 's okay , we know you do n't want the others to know you do ) . 
  we 'll remain close in trade , security and culture , our relationship will just be a bit more different from now on , we 'll make it work i 'm sure , i believe the saying is `` united in diversity '', 
  every remain campaigner said leave meant leaving the single market . 
  not entirely the outcome i wanted ( single market membership would make sense at least on a transitional level ) , but if we were going full hard brexit we 'd already be out of the eu , the government is going to try and keep us as close as possible while winning the immigration controls people want . 
  and leave were n't the only side without a clearly defined path at the vote , remain kept saying they were a vote for `` reform '' but never specified what that reform would be or why we 'd be more capable of getting it than we were when cameron got his paper thin `` renegotiation '', 
  i do n't recall `` isolationism '' being on my ballot paper .

  they vote for both parliaments the devolved parliaments do make local decisions , while the uk government has the right to overrule or completely abolish them , this has never been used as far as i know . 
  the devolved parliaments are given a block grant of money and allowed to spend that as they see fit , the amount they receive and the laws they must followed are determined by the uk government . 
  turns out the love for scotland was only while they could be used to hurt the uk, 
  we 're not a federation , the uk government legally retains supreme authority in all areas , and all the parliaments have different structures and amounts of power , england does n't even have a parliament . 
  legally , we 're a unitary state , not a federal one . 
   it 's actually a mutual benefit for both parties i agree , but evidently britain felt we were n't getting enough  but that 's how the free market works and yet every nation has immigration controls  change is inevitable agreed , so i 'm sure you 'll accept our change in relationship with the eu  read the whole post . 
  there are other aspects involved very difficult to measure aspects though , the measurable contribution and trade figures you gave simply do n't add up for it be a net benefit so you 're relying on vague benefits  you have a very limited point of view . 
  `` the eu is a net benefit for everyone '' is also a very limited point of view , there are flaws that were clearly too much for us to tolerate  read the whole post . 
  there are other aspects involved . 
  i read the whole post and got transparent platitudes  you 're living in denial . 
  i stand by my vote , the worst thing about it so far is that people on the other side of the continent are trying to convince me deep down i * know * i 'm wrong . 
   not all eu members are in the schengen area yes but the vast majority of them are and the ones that are n't are bound by the same policy and legally required to join when they meet the requirements  thanks , brexit ? 
  `` tourism will fall and that is bad '' `` actually , tourism has risen '' `` well , that 's bad '', 
   cheap work force immigrants should not be an underclass we leave the menial and underpaid jobs for . 
   have long been a big `` import '' of the uk from eastern europe . 
  and have rapidly changed the face of working class communities , people do n't tend to like quick changes they 've neither asked for or approved of . 
   our contribution to # 12.9 billion . 
   total eu spending in the uk : $ 7.458 billion so we contribute more than is given back to us . 
   cost of at least # 4.5 bn add this to the eu spending in the uk and it is # 1bn short of the uk contribution . 
   companies are already relocating setting up tiny eu offices to continue trading in the eu is a far cry from the financial exodus we were promised . 
   people will have to get visas in order to travel . 
  the schengen area has visa-free travel with every `` western '' nation , i ca n't see the uk being demoted to african or asian levels in the eu 's eyes . 
   tourism will take a huge hit no one has been talking about visas for eu nationals wanting to visit , and tourism has gone up since the vote following the devaluation of the pound . 
  the uk has already said it wants every eu immigrant to stay , just ca n't guarantee it until the eu guarantees the same for brits . 
  and the common travel area is still in effect . 
  you 're a european with or without the eu and for the record even if it was just england-wales that 's still 90 % of the current uk population , the uk would continue and i ca n't imagine much changing on a day to day basis, 
  [ they could have been the fifth country of the united kingdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maltese_united_kingdom_integration_referendum,_1956 ), 
  the uk has already tried to seek a deal where immigrants from both sides are allowed to stay where they are , i imagine this will be the first thing agreed and i really really * really * ca n't see us deporting students ( if anyone , to be honest ), 
  sounds reasonable really , the transitional agreement is likely to be a trial run for a trade agreement anyway went in to this expecting to be worried but instead found out the 2 years of safety will more likely be 5 , and possibly extended as we gradually separate rather than server entirely . 
  it delivers what the uk voted for and maintains the eu 's unity , i 'm happy to see the eu take this position and imagine the uk government will be as well .

  thank you for the compliment but let 's not take away the contributions from the rest of the uk . 
  [ i find this hard to believe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/15cewvq.jpg ), 
  god , i love this sub , since the neo-nazis because euroskeptics it 's the only place to find raving euronationalism, 
   that 's what pro-brexit politicians told you i do n't know how else to explain this , this vote was about * so much more * than money , as this article shows , most of us think we 'll be worse off , yet the majority of us still think we should leave , and the government is enjoying brilliant approval ratings . 
   people are already regretting their `` yes '' vote people always regret their vote , but `` regrexit '' was insanely exaggerated by wishful thinkers , . i 've met remain voters who regret their vote , do n't think the likes of hollande and his `` there must be a threat , there must be a risk , there must be a price '' went unnoticed . 
   and companies , banks as well , have started moving some of their assets they 're setting up eu offices to continue trading there , to be expected and hardly the financial exodus we were threatened with . 
   that 's propaganda talking . 
  it may comfort you to think we were brainwashed , but we were n't , the vast majority of people want real controls over eu immigration . 
   sovereignty this was a long term vote , it was about the next 50 years rather than the next 5 , previous governments brought us too close too quickly , so we voted to prevent a future government from doing that , it 's very easy to step closer to europe , very hard to step back . 
   the real reason people voted `` yes '' on brexit is fear and ignorance how can you expect to meet someone halfway if you wo n't even recognise their concerns or motivations as valid ? 
  many work for below minimum wage , it 's a fucking travesty how many people took the side of the business owners paying a pittance . 
   trade deals yes , and in order to have one , we are leaving the single market . 
   they 'll be worse than the ones from before we 've accepted that , but they 're likely to come with no ( or at least fewer ) contributions to the eu budget and immigration controls , so to many people they 'll be better . 
   you 're angry at romanians no  you 're going to bring up gypsies no  how about all of those romanians that cook and clean for you good people in almost all experiences i 've had with them , i just do n't think immigrants should be an underclass who do all the menial jobs ( a position that remain campaigners seemed to celebrate for some reason ) however , these people moving in such numbers to poor areas has changed those areas , the romanians are n't to blame , it 's a natural side effect of high low-skill low-income immigration , but the effects and concerns were ignored by our government for too long , and that led to tensions , which led to brexit . 
  i do n't blame the immigrants , but i 'm also not going to blame or dismiss the natives . 
   direct input and direct output i 'm not , i already accepted the contributions were worth it in an earlier comment , but you 're ignoring the social side of the single market , namely free movement and concerns over `` ever closer union ''  the uk is already starting to feel honestly , very little has changed , the inflation has made things * very slightly * more expensive , but our tourism and exports have risen as a side effect , we 'd be in a stronger financial position if we remained but the sky has n't fallen yet . 
   only served as a reminder of why the eu was created in the first place .
