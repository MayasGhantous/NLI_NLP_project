  if you think franco-german relations would be as bad as they were before the eu if the eu were to split up tomorrow , you have zero faith in the people on this continent to not murder each other . 
  you ca n't seriously think the eu is the only thing stopping another war , can you ? 
  it was needed after the war , certainly , and it is needed now as people still want it , but i just ca n't see us falling into another war if the eu split up . 
  if you based your actions on the entirety of human history rather than analysing the world around you you 'd never be able to relax for fear of being murdered for your food . 
  i 'm not saying i want the eu to fall apart , but i ca n't imagine we 'd have wwiii if it did , we 're all nato members and close trading partners , not to mention democracies , which rarely go to war with one another , we have no reason to fight . 
  bit different as the us has been a sovereign state for hundreds of years and the eu is a trade bloc/integration project that is only a few decades old . 
  because we 're all naturally driven to kill each other on this continent , are n't we ? 
  welcome to the dark side . 
   first chance all the anglosphere parts of the empire remained a part of it for a while when they had the infrastructure to go it alone , canada , australia and new zealand left peacefully over time as the empire declined and still share a monarch with us , only the us had a hostile split , and we 've been allies with them for over 100 years now . 
  i would n't say it 's so much that the anglo parts broke away , it 's that : a ) they were set up to be more able to do so b ) we allowed them to do so over time and without a war ( with one obvious exception of course ) the asian and african parts hate us a lot more . 
  i know , they had a viking civ too , both decisions were silly . 
  quick guys , downvote any good news about britain !, 
  at least the housing crisis will be fixed . 
   isnt it funny that all the `` anglosaxon '' parts of the british empire were the first ones to leave ? 
  not really , they were the only ones given the capability to leave instead of being plundered for wealth like the african and asian colonies . 
  the britain thing has constantly annoyed me , the british empire was the biggest the world has ever seen and yet has n't been in a civ game . 
  they even introduced us as `` the british '' in the teaser video for the english civ6 civ for god 's sake ... 
  english leader , standing in the scottish highlands , wearing a kilt and speaking welsh . 
  it would be like if there was a single `` native american '' civ . 
  i really wish they 'd just make a british civ and an irish civ instead of messing around with england & everything-else-on-these-islands-mushed-into-one-civ, 
  we were good at repairs ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ ^ had ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ manufacturing ^ ^ ^ ^ industry, 
  shame he had to throw the country into greater uncertainty than brexit would have naturally caused in order to get one over on his old eton friends though ... 
  honestly i ca n't be arsed to find a source of something widely known for someone who is bitter about democracy and just wants to vent . 
  i 'm not going to explain to you the history of european integration , go read the treaty of rome , go ready almost every other treaty and listen to the tons of european politician who have spoken of `` ever closer union '' i 'm not saying it will definitely happen , i 'm saying it 's likely , and may be necessary to avoid repeated euro-crisis ' . 
   not ashamed at all of your opportunistic attitute optimism , did n't know the eu had regulated that as bad yet , good to know . 
   but a person from japan is in the same line for you ? 
  i guess that was a point about how britain is isolated now ? 
  well , i 'm fine with being treated in the same way as the japanese , i believe in equality so i 'm fine with that , i should n't have special treatment because i 'm a european . 
  not a farage fan and i gave an answer , not sure what you 're on about ever closer union has been in the eu since the start and irresponsible and differing tax and spending policies across a shared currency is what caused the eurozone crisis , * sweetheart *, 
  thank you , i really appreciate that, 
  i 'm not talking about what you would expect , i 'm talking about what i would expect of myself , i would want to earn my place in your country , as i would in any other , not be given it by accident of birth i 'm not talking about deporting immigrants or condemning the unemployed or pregnant , one of my closest friends is in a similar situation to the guy in that article and it would never decy him for not having a job . 
  look , let 's just call it a day , you keep putting words into my mouth and are only focusing on the parts of my comments you can take issue with as you `` do n't have the energy '' to deal with the rest take care, 
  leaving the eu does not mean we dislike and do n't want the best for the european continent , as the eu has tried but has n't yet resolved the ukraine situation , would you support escalation ? 
  if so , what would that be ? 
  a single eu army ? 
  bringing ukraine in to the eu ? 
  declaring war on russia ? 
  how much and would someone have to be against escalation before they can be dismissed as `` not giving a fuck '' ? 
  if you want me to list three reasons from the vote leave campaign then i ca n't do that as i thought the campaign was a complete shambles filled with lies and misinformation , however i felt the same way about the remain campaign . 
  sanity would have been the loser in this referendum no matter the vote . 
  if you want my three biggest reasons for leaving , here they are 1 ) ** sovereignty ** ( and no , you not thinking it matters does n't mean it does n't matter ) . 
  the eu has , from the start , had a goal of integration and `` ever closer union '' , the will for this has been clear from the treaty of rome and the requirement for it was made incredibly clear by the eurozone crisis , if the euro is to survive taxing and spending policies in eurozone states must be brought closer in line , this inevitably will bring the eurozone gradually closer to psuedo-federalisation . 
  now , the uk has an opt out to most things ( provided the government would n't relinquish it ) , but either way a federated eurozone means britain 's future within the eu would either be as part of a huge federation , or closely linked to and influenced by one . 
  i support democracy being as close to the people as possible , it is hard to argue that remaining in the eu would have delivered that goal . 
  2 ) ** the uk was a constant roadblock to the eu 's plans ** , our opt-outs , complaints , rebate and other `` special treatment '' got on your nerves . 
  the uk never really got fully on board with the european project and constantly had one foot out of the door , we were never going to get fully on board with things like the euro and schengen , so i felt it best for the eu in the long term that we left , so they could work towards integration or whatever else they have planned that we would have tried to block . 
  3 ) ** immigration ** ( and no , not the `` they took our jerbs ! '', 
  i do not believe i should have the right to live in finland simply because i born on the same continent , if i was to ever move to finland i would want to already know the language and be taking a job that means i make a meaningful contribution to the country . 
  if free movement works well for the eu then that 's fine , but for me , a german , frenchman , austrian or any other type of european should n't automatically be more entitled to live here than a mexican , ghanan or a japanese person . 
  free movement has forced us to make non-eu immigration needlessly hard in order to keep overall immigration at a manageable level , how fair is it that we apply different entry requirements to people based on which continent they were born ? 
  you do n't need to agree , but i hope you at least understand why someone would want to leave the eu . 
  you would be surprised how many people i heard use her as a reason to remain , `` jo cox wanted to remain '' was basically added as a suffix to the `` putin/isis/trump / hitler want us to leave '' arguments . 
  i do give a fuck about ukraine and do n't want us to lift the sanctions . 
  i 'll be voting for an internationalist party that wants to co-operate without being part of a project of integration . 
  russia is n't going to attack an eu or nato member , putin is terrible but he 's not insane . 
  we are not working for russia , nor are we working for you , we are working for us now . 
  if the eu is so weak it will crumble without us then it was doomed with or without this vote . 
  nato still exists , i understand as a finn that means little to you , but it 's not like we 're breaking away violently and working with russia or china to undermine europe . 
   haha , nope , the only thing that was paper thin was your loyalty and commitment to this union . 
  and yet , you 're sad we left  did n't you guys show them how strong your `` camaraderie '' and respect is they voted to remain part of the uk , this was a uk decision , should they choose to change their position we 'll accept that like adults . 
  i do n't think there is much point in continuing our discussion , you clearly have an axe to grind with the brits who did n't follow the eu 's wishes so you 're not going to listen to me . 
  enjoy scotland `` when '' they leave us , although nearly 40 % of them voted to leave the eu , which is a higher number than most uk polls just a few years , as you 're going to get rid of one euroskeptic country just to welcome another you should be careful , this euroskeptisim could easily get worse when you start to take away their newly gained control , the scots are not a people who respond well to being pushed around . 
  well he 's not married to a beautiful and charming woman anymore and spends most of his time writing letters to parliament about meaningless things . 
  i imagine other than that he 's just hoping he can outlive his mum . 
  i hope that for the sake of europe you 're wrong , if leaving the eu results in you wanting a country completely isolated and defeated then your camaraderie is paper thin and the union is doomed . 
   oh i am so innocent not what i 'm doing , it 's more `` i 'm not the devil '' , there is a large area between the two  it does n't suit you . 
  nor does acting like a jilted lover suit you  demanding niceness i 'm not * demanding * anything , i 'm * hoping * for civility  the fact is your `` leave '' - vote was your vote for xenophobia and racism i know you 're angry but you can fuck right off if you think you get to tell me why i voted the way i did  in your world uk can do whatever it likes this is n't the 1800 's and believe it or not we realise that , we know we 're not going to get everything we want , but europe is not in a position to throw us to the wolves , we can survive without you in the same way you can survive without us . 
   but also expecting good deals we are expecting * fair * deals  but you are no longer family then we never were  now grow up and stop crying rather rich coming from the person who has resorted to calling 52 % of brits racist and calling the entire country entitled i know it hurts , but praying for hostility will hurt both of us , life will go on , we will keep trading , we will keep co-operating , we will keep visiting one another , things will be fine in the end , and i think the eu and uk will both be better off apart . 
  you 're our closest neighbours , our largest trading partners , and some of our closest allies . 
  i did not vote leave out of animosity or hatred , i partially voted because i felt us leaving would be better for the eu . 
  i want this split to be as amicable as possible . 
  yes , we voted to leave , and yes , some of you are hurt by that , and while i understand it i dislike seeing people excited to watch us fail and talking about the parts of our economy or country they want to pick away from us like animals feeding from a corpse . 
  i 'm not saying all europeans feel this way , but a lot of them on this sub do , i do n't think it 's constructive . 
  i suppose my point is , this is the end of our partnership , but it does n't have to be the end of our friendship . 
  exactly . 
  think of it this way , the queen is like a personification of the country , she appoints the prime minister , welcomes guests , visits other nations and has a nice house the tourists can look at . 
  however , in order to `` be '' the united kingdom you surrender your own identity and must accept any choices the country makes , yet not alienate those who were against that choice , which is why she appoints the pm the parliament chooses , approves all their laws and says nothing when it comes to politics , even the most neutral of statements could be interpreted as supporting one position or another . 
  we have politicians and celebrities for grand statements , the queen is there to create a sense of stability , continuity and unity , and she does that by being in the background as a nice old granny we see every now and again . 
  whether she does that successfully or not or has the right to do so is debated , but that 's her role in theory . 
  * thank you * i 'm 24 , and i 'm sick of seeing my age group pretend they 're victims when less than half of them went out to vote . 
  we can have referendums on this , honestly with decisions that alter the course of a nation 's future like this it 's arguably too big for politicians to make . 
  however , we need to do them in a better way , we need clear rules and what is and is n't okay to claim , we need more than two options on the ballot , we need the government to make their plans for any result clear rather than saying there is no plan for the option they do n't want . 
  quite frankly , we need to be better . 
  they often check passports within the common travel area , i do n't know if they 'd be quite as quick to get on board with borderless travel, 
  let 's not act like only the leave side was like that . 
  so you would remove ireland 's opt outs ? 
  i know it 's a hard situation but they should n't be punished for our decisions and border controls between ireland and northern ireland would be a needless hindrance to the good friday agreement and a needless holdback on our transition to eea membership ( which , let 's face it , is what we should have had in the first place ) do ireland want to adopt schengen ? 
  that may make the discussion different . 
  we do n't really do that here , the pm acts as a de facto head of state as well as a head of government , the queen only gives nice speeches like opening the olympics and the nice sentiments at christmas , it 's part of the reason why she 's so popular . 
  took the words right out of my mouth . 
  we are europeans and we will retain close friendships with our neighbours , but we 've neglected our family for too long . 
  `` not because of any phony brexiters blessing ... '', 
  i agree with you , our exit should be fair for both of us , as not only will that be the friendliest way to part , it 'll likely be the safest as like it or not our economies are linked quite closely . 
  but you 're right the eu can not show weakness at this time , unfortunately , nor can the uk . 
  the campaigns were terrible , i 'm deeply disappointed in us . 
  for what it 's worth , i hope we remain in the eea and the vote is certainly close enough to justify it , although preferably with the schengen opt-out in order to avoid forcing border checks or schengen on ireland . 
  sadly we do n't have a very representative electoral system so we do n't really get the chance to elect governments that are levelheaded and able to represent us in such a way , the last time we came close the junior member was punished for forming a government . 
  while this referendum looks bad in terms of british views towards the continent , and despite how the campaigns may have made it look , a vote to leave was n't necessarily a vote against europeans , just against the eu and britain 's place within it . 
  but you 're right , we 're not the most polite of nations when we speak on an international level . 
  unfortunately that is a predictable cause of your position as de facto head of the eu ( and a side effect of our status as a declining superpower leading to needless animosity to old enemies ) but if the feeling is that bitter , perhaps leaving is the best thing for our relationship , it 's a shame it had to be this way but ultimately it 's better to be a liked neighbour than a hated housemate .
