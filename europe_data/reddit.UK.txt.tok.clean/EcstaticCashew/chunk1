i saw an article today about british voters who are brence-sitters for not being brexiters or bremanians . 
  it was the explicit intention of many founders of modern european integration like jean monnet to create a system of ' [ spillover ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neofunctionalism ) ' , whereby integration in one area would lead to integration in another area in order to function . 
  which is the fact that the pro-eu campaign in britain never mentions , indeed , actively lies about . 
  the position britain is always told is that we are n't signed up to ` ever closer union ' . 
  the government in particular has been going on recently about how britain has a legally-binding special deal that excludes us from this which is simply untrue . 
  i can hardly blame other eu countries for being confused why the majority of brits support staying in the eu when a very clear majority also oppose ever closer union . 
  i add marmite underneath . 
  what 's up with corsica ? 
  because of the eu 's trajectory . 
  there is n't a status quo . 
  if they 're well off and think that immigration has been bad for the poorest . 
  the reason is actually that we have low taxes on energy compared to the rest of europe . 
  i hardly think that it 's uncalled for . 
  a brexit would be a pretty big constitutional change . 
  [ what do they have against the ivory coast though ? 
  ] ( http://www.newstalk.ie/content/001/images/000016/26931_53_blog_entries_5645_656x500.jpg ), 
  this is moving slightly into speculation of what the british government * will * do rather than what 's open to them . 
  suffice to say that i think that if cameron does that then i think that it will be pretty silly . 
  however , he is also the unofficial leader of the in campaign . 
  it 's in his interest to present the most unfavourable conditions britain could face post-brexit . 
  there 's nothing in the referendum or act that launched the referendum about activating article 50 immediately . 
   is the next government bound by the referendum ? 
  the referendum is n't legally binding either way . 
  its only power is that everyone has agreed to respect the outcome . 
  so * de jure * it does n't bind the next government , or indeed the current government , but * de facto * it binds both of them . 
  the only way that the time limit will be set by the next referendum is if the government artificially binds itself by saying that that 's the deadline . 
   if it takes 10 years to negotiate new conditions after exercising art . 
  then it would take even longer if it is delayed i 'm saying that article 50 does n't have to be activated for the negotiations to start . 
  that 's a false equivalence . 
  the comparison here is between activating article 50 immediately or once a deal has already started to be negotiated . 
  in both cases you do n't `` know if your investment would still be worth something 5 years down the road '' but in the case of delaying the activation of article 50 you would have absolutely more certainty about the short term , and also a bit more certainty about the medium to long term if the government is stating that it is n't activating article 50 until it has secured a certain number of things . 
   limbo after an out vote would continue even longer how so ? 
  activating it immediately would set a deadline after which businesses would n't know what the deal was . 
  there would understandably be a great deal of uncertainty as to what the market conditions in 2018 would be like . 
  not activating it immediately would meant that businesses know exactly what market conditions will be in the short term : the exact same as they are now . 
  predictable catholic-protestant divide . 
  what 's interesting are the catholic areas that do n't have lots of saint names like southern germany and ireland . 
  the only uncertainty is if article 50 is activated immediately . 
  only the british government can do that , the eu ca n't impose it . 
  i have n't heard of any . 
  some might be planning but not announcing but so far the only one i can think of off the top of my head is hsbc who said that their european hq is staying in london regardless of brexit . 
  if saying that in poland really would land you in jail then i think that the newspaper is just trolling you :p keep in mind that the newspaper in the op is just clickbait . 
  it has actually wound up recently as a newspaper so online is all it has . 
  well it 's hard to blame you for not having an in-depth knowledge of a country the other side of europe but * england was itself only a colony of a larger power in 1169 when ireland was first invaded * the scots were just as enthusiastic colonisers as the english over many centuries even before the union in 1707, 
  the uk uses 16-64 whereas that uses 15-64 . 
  does that explain the small difference between the uk on that and the figures in the op ? 
  [ too late !, 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34345684 ), 
  he might be joking , but the refugee crisis is almost certainly going to have an effect on the outcome of the eu referendum . 
  last spring the polls showed a very firm lead for `` stay '' , whereas now it 's far more even . 
  it has certainly got a lot more crowded in the last few years . 
  i took my cousin from south africa around it last year and it was far more crowded than when i went as a kid about fifteen years ago . 
  you missed out ( imo ) the best of all : the [ natural history museum ] ( http://www.nhm.ac.uk/ ) in london . 
  in york , excluding sundays , it is perfectly legal to shoot a scotsman with a bow and arrow . 
  it is also illegal under pain of treason to stick a postage stamp upside down . 
  here are some others http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1568475/ten-stupidest-laws-are-named.html, 
  or maybe they just could n't find a british person who could speak a foreign language ? 
  [ well that reminds me ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfm1x0o2pnc ), 
   my school also offered gcse punjabi to those who spoke it as a 1st language . 
  it seems a bit pointless to offer it if they speak it as a first language does it not ? 
  why do people use eu flags to represent europe in the ryder cup ? 
  this is some next-level pedantry, 
  [ i can remember this ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/967461/thumbs/o-half-of-our-women-loo-570.jpg ), 
  i 'll try find some polls , but basically yes . 
  it 's the overwhelming issue with regards to the upcoming eu referendum . 
  if there 's no change then i 'd say it 's likely britain will leave the eu .

  [ it 's 50:50 in the polls at the moment . 
  norway was rich before it discovered oil , just not as rich, 
  this parliament is significantly more hung than ours was in 2010 . 
  there was a single , obvious coalition in 2010 that would have a stable majority . 
  is there no possibility of psoe supporting pp . 
  iirc something unprecedented like that happened in greece . 
  if no-one can form a coalition will there be another election ? 
  in 1997 russia 's gdp was smaller than belgium 's . 
  that did n't mean that belgium had more international clout though . 
  gdp does n't translate perfectly into power projection . 
  here it 's funded centrally along with a top up for the poorest areas called the `` pupil premium '' . 
  [ here 's a graph from the ifs ] ( http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/images/graphs/obs_101115.jpg ) http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8042 black africans actually perform very well . 
  the on average lowest attainers are working class whites . 
  it does seem like culture plays a big factor , which makes government intervention all the more tricky . 
  do n't hire someone from the baltics as a lifeguard, 
   smoked salmon and soda bread to start other than that , yes . 
  especially as soda bread is far more common in ireland . 
  i have n't heard of salmon as a starter for christmas . 
  i 'd say that that pushes you the 2 calories ahead needed to top the americans !, 
  who would have thought that wrapping small sausages in bacon would be highly calorific ?!, 
  i work for an mp and i can confirm , i 've never seen beans on any menu there ... 
  [ the roman 's used the semi-circle . 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vkbldxavu8i/uohdu-km1yi/aaaaaaaaayg/mesfhkha3rg/s1600/rome+senate.jpg ) i 'd imagine that that is the reason unless it goes back further . 
  personally i prefer the antagonistic setup . 
  it leads to more vigorous debate while the real work goes on in committees . 
  basically . 
  it 's the state opening of parliament . 
  it 's actually a fascinating ceremony involving a general getting a door slammed in his face , the commons giving up a hostage to the monarchy and the cellars being searched for a modern day gunpowder plot ( all for show of course ) . 
  [ did you miss the throne at the end of the house of lords in op 's album ? 
  ] ( https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/26438/qs4-web.jpg ) though canada 's chambers do look more luxurious for the legislators . 
  particularly with the stained glass windows . 
  the work does n't tend to go on in the chamber ( apart from rare times like the 10 hour debate on syrian air strikes ) it 's the work that happens in committees and elsewhere . 
  it 's inherently adversarial .
