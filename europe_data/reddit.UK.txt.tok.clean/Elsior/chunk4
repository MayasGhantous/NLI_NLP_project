  no extensions . 
  now safari has all of those things , but most people switched during the wait for safari to get those . 
  and once you switch , it takes a lot to make somebody switch back . 
  i think the bbc mistitled that a bit . 
  would have read better ( but longer i guess ) as `` eu introduces import controls on illegally logged timber '' . 
  but props to nastratin for sticking to reddiquette . 
  why force of law . 
  i was kind of hoping the industry would make up it 's mind on one standard . 
  great , so vhs vs betamax for cars . 
  got to love the lack of standards in just about every industry . 
  not everybody works a full time job . 
  per hour means it is also fair to part time workers . 
  but this is a major issue requiring a massive diversion of political energy to make sure such an `` important '' issue is correctly resolved , and not as a way to make people forget for even a moment the massive corruption scandal hitting the pp . 
  the mona lisa is too hyped up . 
  it 's not a bad painting , just nothing spectacular about it . 
  especially when the louvre has so many fantastic art works . 
  hopefully visitors to the louvre stay and appreciate the other art works there . 
  that is so good to hear . 
  oops , missed the bit in the article where the painting had been moved to a new branch of the louvre in lens , northern france . 
  so do not go behind the mona lisa to try and find it . 
  still a shock though . 
  that 's shocking . 
  i know the guilty party has mental issues . 
  but still . 
  this painting hangs behind the mona lisa . 
  the amount of people checking out the mona lisa when this stunning painting hangs behind really disappointed me . 
  it really is a stunning painting . 
  i 'm not even an art lover and was shocked by the impact when i saw this . 
  what a sad event . 
  hope the museum is right that it can be restored perfectly . 
   `` we have a right to privacy in our constitution , but this does not mean a fundamental right to data protection , '' rodgers said at a conference in berlin um , yes it does actually . 
  yep . 
  it 's nothing special , and they managed to design it around a 60 foot vent for the blackwall tunnel . 
  they somehow did n't see that ? 
  i 'm not seeing much representation for london , so here goes . 
  [ trellick tower ] ( http://d4k7s9ho8qact.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/trellick-2.jpg?9d7bd4 ) - considered by many as a shining example of the beauty of brutalist architecture . 
  me , i do n't get it . 
  [ south bank centre ] ( http://d4k7s9ho8qact.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/national-theatre-2.jpg?9d7bd4 ) - seriously ugly sprawling mass of mugging prospects . 
  [ robin hood gardens ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/robin_hood_gardens_ap_smithson.jpg ) - was the name a homage to the type of people dumped here by the council ? 
  let 's not forget london 's jewel in the crown ( according to the politicians anyway ) the [ millennium dome ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/millennium_dome_1.jpg ) . 
  the problem with the europhobes here in the uk , is that they argue that their ideas are facts . 
  if we leave ( and assuming i stay here ) things could get worse , could get better . 
  but the idea that we 'll be able to control it all is ridiculous . 
  a lot will depend on how sympathetic other countries are to working with us and agreeing bilateral agreements that they then stick to . 
  not a bad thing imho . 
  actually , i think this would be the one time they did it right . 
  and once we moved and anchored , they would discover that the mid-atlantic has some of the worst storm weather on earth . 
  not just the uk ( though we 'll be the loudest  ) . 
  most of the scandies will bail as well as most of eastern europe . 
  frankly , merkel promised to do in germany something as a gut reaction to the voters . 
  then the actual impact catches up to her . 
  the bbc is funded via a licence fee . 
  not a tv tax . 
  though you could argue it 's the same thing as 99 % of people pretty much have to pay it . 
  there are no ads on bbc channels for products . 
  it does carry ads for bbc shows , but really those are just promos . 
  curse words are bleeped before the `` watershed '' ( that 's a time when children are expected to still be awake ) . 
  after that , cursing and nudity are fine . 
  we just do n't typically have gratuitous amounts of either . 
  as for ad breaks , yes , the uk breaks are typically shorter . 
  there are also very stringent rules about how many you can have in an hour block . 
  i 'm guessing he meant / r/europe/new /, 
  ireland + northern ireland = island of ireland england , scotland and wales = gb gb + island of ireland + 2000 odd smaller isles ( isle of man , guernsey , jersey , shetland , orkney and a host of far smaller isles ) = british isles . 
  check out this guys [ blog ] ( http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/the-difference-between-the-united-kingdom-great-britain-england ) . 
  best explanation ever . 
  problem is most brits do n't talk about gb and uk in the same context . 
  gb is geographic . 
  uk is political . 
  oh , and do n't get people started on british isles . 
  europe . 
  that 's near africa , right ? 
  see , you blew it by saying great britain . 
  all japanese people know where england is . 
  however , they will point at the whole uk , not just england . 
  do not , under any circumstances try to explain england is one of four nations in the uk . 
  you 'd still be in germany trying to explain it if you had . 
  in spanish , the one i love is  como como ? 
  como como como . 
  which means , how do i eat ? 
  i eat the way i eat . 
  but you 're his bottom bitch . 
  as a brit , i 100 % approve of this article being posted here . 
  as well as queueing , a stiff upper lip is also a well known british trait . 
  we can handle the ridicule . 
  let 's be honest , we deserve it for allowing this guy to even walk the streets . 
  labour does this every decade or two . 
  turns completely left wing barmy . 
  then after one or two absolutely awful general election losses , they correct . 
  unfortunately the last time they did this , we got blair 's new labour . 
  though even that looks good compared to the tories right now . 
  i tried . 
  my brain locked up as a self defence mechanism . 
  that 's interesting . 
  because the flight to newark is also much cheaper . 
  may well consider this in the future . 
  well i did exaggerate those for the irony . 
  but last time i went through heathrow , the queue for the bio-metric passport readers was actually worse than that for the agents who manually check . 
  my boss was fortunately about ten minutes ahead of me , so he rang me to tell me to get out of the bio-metric line . 
  still took 15 minutes . 
  but i could see people in the bio-metric line that were ahead of me that had n't even reached the mid way point .
