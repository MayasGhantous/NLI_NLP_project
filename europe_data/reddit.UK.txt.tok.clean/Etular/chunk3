  on the contrary , last i checked , janteloven ( which most , regrettably , will now say is `` outdated '' ) was meant to be an internalised set of beliefs , that `` you will not think that you are better than us '' etc. 
  your people have access to the nordic model and the welfare state that is a part of it , yet ( like every other country everywhere ) still have people getting in arms about immigrants using it , in the same way that every dane has the ability to . 
  then , of course , there is the similar issue of `` only a dane is allowed to fully speak their mind in denmark '' , `` only a danish opinion really counts '' ( including the application to religion , where the secular war against christianity is mild at best ) , and `` if you do n't like something that the country does , you can get out ! '' . 
  that is hardly equality . 
   we all live in this world where people find racism where there is none more often than finding some where it is present . 
  if you think any `` race '' needs special care or privilege , you are the racist . 
  and to top it all off , of course , a fundamental misunderstanding of racism . 
  whilst it is true that race is a fairly recent conception ( compared to the previous focus on nationhood as a form of discrimination ) , it 's pretty universally accepted that `` racism '' as a definition refers primarily to the * negative * discrimination against a group of people . 
  this is in contrast to * positive discrimination * , which has been adopted by many socially-democratic and liberal nations who promote an * equality of opportunity * and have realised that , in minorities , there lacks such an opportunity to do as well as the majority . 
  i support fully such attempts to give minorities a better education than they have currently , trying to improve their economic status and decrease their inclinations towards crime as a result of alienation , negative discrimination and the aforementioned lack of socio-economic status . 
  you call it inviting my `` friends '' , i call it `` spreading the word to a larger audience '' . 
  the term `` brigading '' is hardly accurate , as srs is hardly a unified body who agree on everything ; albeit , it does differ from much of reddit in that its members disagree with tasteless or abhorrent viewpoints . 
  there is nothing wrong in spreading the word to say `` hey , this thread exists !, 
   it does in no way relate to the religious and cultural persecution aimed towards certain sexual orientations . 
  tell that to me , a good 50-100 years down the line , when discrimination against the likes of sexual orientation swings back and forth like a pendulum , just as racism has , and you see people testing the boundaries for that , with people justifying it just because it was done so in a subtle manner , and did n't have `` gay people are evil '' written all over it . 
  we live in an age where people will rightfully get all prissy at uneducated comments such as `` all gay people are camp '' , or images of the stereotypical housewife of the early 20th century ; but , when it comes to race , we 've gotten to this point where people can come out with the most absurdly racist stereotypes and , as long as certain key words are n't used , we just laugh it off . 
  it 's freaking disgusting , and i 've never understood the logic behind how it 's okay to discriminate against different minorities in different ways . 
  ofcourse , your country [ has n't exactly been a beacon of cultural sensitivity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jyllands-posten_muhammad_cartoons_controversy ) , itself , when it comes to matters of race and religion - it seems to take a laxer approach to such issues and , like the rest of europe , has led to an opening for [ nationalist right-wing populism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_people%27s_party ) as a result . 
  do n't get me wrong , i applaud your country 's sense of equality in other areas but , like the rest of europe , denmark seems to be just as willing to sit back , or even support , whilst you have politicians rambling on about ethnic homogeneity , and how that would apparently solve every problem . 
  somewhere along the way you lost your janteloven ; and those swedish democrats have certainly lost their lagom ( and their marbles , for that matter ) . 
  we live in this peculiar world where everyone is going to say `` me ? 
  i 'm not racist !, 
  that ? 
  that was n't racist !, 
  '' , whilst all sharing this common understanding ( or common ignorance ) that our actions and prejudices fit the definition . 
  no-one is willing to say `` i am a racist '' because it 's socially unacceptable , but until people can admit it , the problem f racism wo n't be dealt with . 
  this is a manifestation of that , and trust me when i say that this problem is only going to get worse before it gets better . 
   it 's fucking candy . 
  that 's the entire point . 
  they could have designed their candy literally any other way , but decided `` racial caricatures '' was the route they wanted to go down . 
  that 's why we see it as so absurdly offensive . 
  for someone who is blinded to the racial aspect , i can not think of a suitable analogy to represent the vulgarity of it all - the closest i can think of is that , dependant on which country you live , it would be deemed offensive to market [ love hearts ] ( http://www.lovehearts.com/ ) with sexist/homophobic quotations on , or sell genitalia-resembling / `` pornographic '' candy in clear view of children ( not a good example to give to a dane , as scandinavians are , admirably , very liberal about sex ) ; it 's about as overt and `` out there '' as those examples , and clearly , if either of those suggested examples had occured in most countries , there would be moral panic and public outrage . 
  then , ofcourse , the article omits other such caricatures - such as [ here ] ( http://avpixlat.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/haribo-skipper-mix2.jpg ) and [ here ] ( https://www.realisten.se/wp-content/uploads/haribo_skipper_mix3-560x320.jpg ) . 
  freedom goes hand in hand with equality , so to me , america will never be free so long as it has such absurdly high rates of inequality . 
  with [ the world 's highest incarceration rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate ) , stemming from for-profit prisons , i would argue that your country is anything but free . 
  this is before even mentioning your high rating on the gini index ( [ income ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) and [ wealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_distribution_of_wealth ) ) , which signifies that `` freedom '' is a luxury only afforded by the rich . 
  sweden has the luxury of being egalitarian and free , in [ more ways ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index ) [ than one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index ) . 
  you certainly have [ the potential ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) to bring `` freedom '' to the masses , certainly compared to most countries , but you choose not to . 
  at least [ one of your neighbours ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada ) are stepping in the right direction . 
  regardless , if you see `` freedom '' in terms of development , the usa [ still does n't top that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index#very_high_human_development ) , and [ certainly not with inequality added ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi ) , where sweden comes significantly above . 
   because liberals are little pansies is sad . 
  spoken like a true conservative . 
   anything else is nanny state bullshit . 
  some of us like nanny state bullshit ; some of us do not . 
  here in europe , we 're more inclined in favour - after all , the state provides public healthcare , transport , welfare and everything else . 
  many of us wish they 'd nationalize more industries . 
  it 's evolved to a point where now , unable to either compete on a political level ( although even that 's questionable , these days ) or otherwise cause harm , the racist has responded to subdued offensive comments , and causes a furore when people call them out on their intolerance . 
  quite simply , if asshats like you did n't shove fucking racial stereotypes ( or , even , faces at all ) on a sweet - instead going for any of the billion far more common shapes , there would be no controversy , would there ? 
  how am i meant to look at `` oh , but they did n't mean to be offensive when they shoved overexaggerated caricatures of racist stereotypes on their sweet , instead of literally anything else '' , and believe it ? 
  if we have no right to be offended , neither individuals or companies have a right to be retarded or otherwise play innocent , either . 
  they should come out and admit they meant it every bit as offensively as it turned out , and we can condemn them openly instead of being all apologistic - `` oh , they did n't mean it !, 
  they just slipped up !, 
  besides , it 's not that bad , y' know ? 
  i would n't mind myself ! '' . 
  as i say , they knew fine fucking well what they were doing - it 's impossible for them not to - although it would be suicide for them to admit it . 
   i 'll say it again , people should n't get to `` not be offended '' . 
  precisely what is the difference between offence and discrimination in this context ? 
  the very nature of this discussion is debating whether or not these sweets were discriminatory or not , and even with the amendment , there 's no resolving of said argument - one side saying they are discriminatory , and the other saying they 're not . 
  not to mention , your amendment has a loophole , anyway - any individual could go up to another and say `` i wish your baby was dead '' , whilst neither inciting violence or discriminating with said comment . 
  the inclusion of verbal harm as a criteria begs the question , also , of where the line is drawn between that and `` offence '' . 
  ofcourse , if you feel such comments as okay to make , then i guess there 's no problem - much like how there is `` no problem '' with the sorts of twisted , distasteful jokes we see on 4chan etc. 
   i also think sd will win a lot of votes in may and september i sense a lot of hot-air and optimism there . 
  in contrast to what a lot of right-wing populists may like to believe , sd ( as well as their equivalents in the other nordic countries ) hardly seem to be resonating with the majority of people , especially not the majority of young people . 
  immigration is nothing more than a topic for the hot-headed conservatives trying to stop the inevitable globalisation . 
  even better would have been the inclusion of the adverb `` then '' ( as well as the aforementioned comma ) , between `` racist '' and `` you '' . 
  you , sir , are supporting the bastardization/debasement of the english language . 
  shame on you . 
  that being said , i would rather be swedish than a ` murican , any day of the week . 
  you , sir , are supporting the bastardization/debasement of the english language . 
  shame on you . 
  if we get down to it , the whole idea of a `` right '' is just an artificial human construction , period . 
  in contemporary society , as it rightfully should be , your `` freedom of speech '' only extends as far as you 're not using your words to intentionally harm , offend or otherwise discriminate against others . 
  in the us , this may only be met with disapproval ; outside of the us , in most of the western world , the expression of discriminatory viewpoints is quite simply a crime . 
  by all means , fascists and racial supremacists should have the ability to gather , congregate , chatter , whatever - but the moment they decide to turn to their despised group and slander or harass them , in the non-us west , they have the law to deal with . 
   where did this concept that if somebody does something that i find offensive that somebody should stop it ? 
  it came from the countless examples in history where this was deemed socially unacceptable - from slavery to genocide initially ; to issues such as legal segregation etc. 
  or , nowadays , to the open expression of vehemently racist/sexist/homophobic views or threats that instil fear and unwelcomeness in such victimized individuals . 
  this is the historical context where the whole idea of treating others how they would like to be treated and not offending them originally came from . 
  this is where the whole idea of not dehumanising others , and not adopting an egoism that runs roughshod over other people 's rights came from . 
  i do n't care how much of a self obsessed `` i should be able to do what i want , * man * !, 
  fuck everyone else ! '', 
  toss-pot certain people ( not necessarily yourself ) are ; if i see something intentionally offensive in the targetting or portrayal towards an individual or group of individuals , i will speak up about it . 
  it goes without saying that that falls into the fallacy of being a `` hasty generalization '' - `` i would n't be offended , therefore , other people should n't be offended '' . 
  quite simply , just because you would n't be offended yourself by a fat bearded guy in a lederhosen ( although , admittedly , that is n't the most offensive german stereotype i can think of , although the alternative tends to be a bit of a touchy subject - it has had its fair share of controversies , however ) , does n't mean that other german individuals would n't be offended by their image in a lederhosen . 
  as for why asians would be offended by such a bad kung-fu movie caracature , ofcourse you would have to ask them , but my belief is that , aside from overemphasising differences , it dehumanises them by turning public perceptions of them into promoting certain alleged traits about them ( even if not everyone believes those traits ) . 
  for every seeming positive stereotype ( `` intelligence '' ) , there 's always a negative ( `` emasculated '' ) , and such caricatures remind them of such negatives , if only because the negative stereotypes and embodied within the caricaturial stereotype . 
  for a german reference , similarly , lederhosen man does n't really represent any negative stereotypes of the germans ( assuming they even have negative stereotypes ) , but focuses upon their quirks instead . 
  we could use different stereotypes playing upon historical events that would be similar , if such events were generalised/stereotyped to refer to an innate `` german nature '' , but that 's the closest comparison i can think of . 
  the way i see it , if it 's the sort of caricature that you 're likely to find on ww2 propaganda posters , it quite simply does n't belong on an edible sweet . 
  even if you forgive the first two sweets displayed in the link , no-one can look at that third - straw-hatted , fumanchu 'd , eye-slanted face - and not agree that it fits every asian stereotype in the western world . 
  for those too culturally insensitive to realise : very few asians have a fumanchu , wear a straw hat , or have eyes as profoundly tilted as on the face . 
  call it `` political correctness gone mad ! '', 
  ( the rallying cry of all people willing to defend their `` right '' to offend/discriminate ) , but i 'm not surprised people were angry and offended by these caricatures . 
  as such a large company , haribo undoubtedly should have forseen the consequences of their actions . 
  simple : as , like here in england , the far-right worldwide tend to make sweeping generalisations about people 's ethnicity and religion being linked . 
  even a syrian catholic is still a syrian refugee ( or , in the eyes of many , just generically an arab ) , and thus still open to targeting and condemnation ( especially since religion is n't something visible , people will likely assume the syrian person was muslim and target them for that , also ) . 
  when you 're the one arab in the town/village , regardless of religion , you 'll flock to where others are because it 's seen as `` safer '' and less likely to be discriminatory , especially in a political climate where anti-immigration sentiment is prominent ( it 's not surprising that it leaves refugees and migrants concerned ) . 
  hence , the existence of ethnic enclaves , self-segregation , `` white flight '' and all that which occurs in pretty much every country . 
  to contribute to the sources listed here , we have the [ transatlantic trends report ] ( http://trends.gmfus.org/files/2014/09/trends_immigration_2014_web.pdf ) and [ the eu 's atlas of european values ] ( http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/home.php?lang=en ) listing the attitudes of various european countries around certain aspects of migration . 
   lol .
