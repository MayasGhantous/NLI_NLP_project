   you 're babbling about this `` freedom of movement '' as if it 's every african 's basic human right to get to live on the dole in england while getting free health care , paid for by the english taxpayer . 
  on the contrary , there is a difference between liberties and rights that you simply are unable to differentiate . 
  freedom of movement is a ** liberty ** , but having food , a home and healthcare is seen as a ** right ** . 
  they are seperate things , but quite frankly , europeans have always been in favour of granting people human rights on the basis that it 's the ethical thing to do . 
  of course , if you want to give these benefits to some disadvantaged people but not others , it 's most definitely unfair and discriminatory - but that 's not my call to make , because it 's not my job to argue over human rights abuses . 
  i 'm arguing liberties that all people should be entitled to in order to be `` free '' . 
  if your concern is in the inequality of the world , though , that makes you scared they 'll all come here , here 's a solution : we increase foreign aid to these people so we remove the incentive . 
  in fact , the use of remittances from migration is * already * seen as a very effective - if not the most effective - way of achieving this sort of wealth redistribution and equalizing of nations , as immigrants often send money home . 
   if you want to talk about social cohesion , nothing destroys it better than `` diversity '' . 
  read about the wonderful history of diversity in these countries : south africa , india , serbia , iraq , sudan , fiji , the philippines . 
  if you want to talk about the successes of migration , look at how the united states of america grew to become the largest nation in the world , with `` new world '' nations like canada , australia , new zealand etc. 
  all up there . 
  then , of course , we have countries like singapore . 
  even saudi arabia and the uae you could say have grown successful on the backs of immigrant labour , even if their means of doing so is dubious . 
  belgium could be used at a stretch - fragmented , but developed , and has developed an inclusive system of pillarisation to minimise tensions . 
  you choose limited examples which benefit yourself . 
  what about china ? 
  historically one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world , that entered a period of decline following the end of the voyages of zheng he in the 1420s , whereupon the emperor decided to close the borders to all outsiders and outside influences . 
  this isolationism led , as we know , to a situation where the british were able to thoroughly defeat the chinese in the opium wars because they had became technologically stagnant and simply did not progress as a nation . 
  a contemporary example would be japan or south korea - nations that are not only suffering an accelerated aging population due to refusing to allow anyone in ( which detrimentally affects their economy ) , but for which the demographic trends point to a complete extinction of both nations within the next thousand years if nothing changes . 
  anything can be done wrong with the wrong techniques or mindset . 
  with more unsuccessful / `` flawed '' democracies than successful ones , i could use similar reasoning to state that the democratic experiment has failed and that we should all go back to dictatorships . 
  to quote the same question that i answered in brief on a different website :  the main reason that people get touchy around anti-immigrationist views primarily comes down to the fact that freedom of movement is a liberty , and to some extent ( holding on to our enlightenment values ) most of us are in favour of liberalism . 
  to seek to restrict freedom of movement is as alien to us as trying to restrict freedom of speech or freedom of expression . 
    few will deny that there are problems or otherwise perceived problems regarding immigration . 
  the question is one of outlook : do you attempt to find a solution to this problem that seeks to stamp out this liberty mostly/entirely , or do you aim to find a solution that aims to keep our liberties alive while attempting to deal with the problem ? 
  most of us have a huge problem with the former , as something tyrannical - for the exact same reason why we 're okay with pragmatically-enforced laws against hate speech , but not for a total , heavily-enforced restriction on speech \u00e0 la orwell 's 1984 . 
  for many of us , these restrictions are the stuff of nightmares . 
  similarly , as for my point that it 's a `` disease '' , other than its seeming ability in this current climate to go viral and spread like a plague , i would see it largely as inciting hate - much like with any other liberty , if you want to restrict it , you have to * justify * why they deserve to be denied their freedom , and that often involves portraying the target groups as inferior or otherwise lesser people ; as a threat . 
  it 's a disease which , quite simply , damages social cohesion , seeking to create social divisions between groups and tear society apart in the hope of both maintaining some sort of perceived ethnic purity and denying freedom to others . 
  it also reinforces artificial boundaries - quite simply , despite our local stereotypes portraying people from a certain region as stupid , no-one cares if someone from newcastle migrates to london , even if they do have an accent , because it 's seen as being within national boundaries . 
  extended , no-one complains about hearing the welsh speaking welsh ( although there are often grumblings about how '' * them * people should not vote in * our * parliament '' . 
  however , i 've heard complaints amongst some brits about people moving even from the wealthier parts of continental europe - such as france or germany - simply because they begin speaking english with an `` alien '' accent and are given less-than-friendly stereotypes in the uk . 
  i would imagine a similar antagonism against certain countries would also be the case between france and its colonies , even when there is no linguistic divide there . 
  i must admit , of every subreddit i 'm a member of , i 've always found it highly surprising that / r/canada is the one i tend to enter the most conflicts over regarding their xenophobic and anti-immigrationist attitudes . 
  honestly , i often have to remind these people that multiculturalism is * a canadian value which is deeply embedded into their constitution * , and i still end up the one with the most downvotes . 
  as stated , anti-immigrationism is everywhere on reddit - like a disease , it pollutes and poisons what might otherwise be good subreddits or topics to discuss . 
   sorry if that 's wildly inaccurate to your experiences , i obviously only got to experience one uni 's course and that was from an outside perspective so i 've really little evidence to back my anecdote up . 
  i would agree with you on pretty much every part , and will go through it bit by bit . 
   fascinating post . 
  i have a lot of friends who went through sociology ( my friends at uni were 50/50 stem and sociology ) and it seems like they were just going through indoctrination with little room for real discussion . 
  i would support that view . 
  there was a couple of occasions i remember , firsthand , where questioning was done by the students in the first year . 
  one made a comment against the idea of a patriarchy , in which another student sitting behind him just stood up and started ranting at him in the lecture theatre . 
  the lecturer shrugged her shoulders , said `` well , i 'm a feminist , and this is what we 're teaching '' , then continued . 
  a second example came in a lecture about culture . 
  a student took offence at the idea that all cultures should be equally respected and started arguing with the lecturer , even bringing up female genital mutilation as an aspect . 
  the lecturer ( who was also head of the department ) basically said that she was narrow-minded , that her opinions were imperialist , and stopped just short of calling her a racist . 
  it 's claimed largely that you can claim anything if you can back it up , but in reality there is this unspoken rule that you can not touch the wrong topic . 
  i stay well away from topics around gender , for instance , since you 're almost required to adopt a radical feminist perspective , and ( with the exception of maybe people like betty friedan ) the literature heavily backs that position up . 
  i would n't dare cite a source by a men 's rights author , or by a sociobiology academic , because i 'd be told anything from it being `` not a sociology source '' , to it being `` wrong '' , or even `` pseudoscience '' . 
  however , in some articles we 're asked to read , i 've had articles where they cite michael jackson as a valid source on race . 
  there is no standardisation . 
   i feel like a large part of the issue is that sociology is the sort of subject people take when they do n't know what else to take . 
  stem might be good for employment but it is n't all that great if you want a more traditional mind-expanding education . 
  philosophy , english , history ... all a bit * specific * and not all that useful outside of a very small amount of careers . 
  you need to be really interested to get much out of them . 
  but sociology , like business and a few others , sounds `` real '' and you get to learn about exciting things that are happening * out in the real world * and , hey , maybe you 'll make a difference with your new perspectives and knowledge . 
  basically this . 
  i was genuinely interested in doing something like mathematics or computing when i was younger , and i had the grades for it , but chose not to because `` i already spend too much time sitting around on my laptop , and want a career that would involve me being more sociable , actually doing something for the world '' . 
  as you say , it sounds `` real '' , so a lot of people go for it on that alone . 
  people like me , who did the a-level , get an equal balance of theory and research , and basically leave believing that sociology and social policy degrees are one and the same . 
  they believe `` oh , it 'll help me understand how society works , and actually research on how certain areas can be fixed '' . 
  then they go to university , learn the theory-methods divide and the `` qualitative shift '' , learn that science is despised , and ( if they 're as unlucky as me ) go to a university where people are taught a degree of `` theory '' ( i.e. 
  sociologists ' and philosophers ' opinions of the world ) for three years straight , and get to the end thinking `` how has any of this helped me in any way whatsoever ? '' . 
  they go in expecting a social * science * , and leave after doing a degree that is probably very similar to that of an english literature degree , because it 's all just learning fancy words and opinions that could never be applied . 
  sociology 's problems have multiple causes , in my opinion - it wanted to become its own subject , separate from the other social sciences , and it 's youth and embracing of 1960s counterculture meant that it chose to do so by deciding `` all the other social sciences are scientific , so let 's differentiate ourselves by rejecting science !, 
  we 'll say that social psychology is different because it 's too scientific , and offer ourselves as an alternative ! '' . 
  that was more of a curse than a blessing , since sociology students got to university only to find people like sigmund freud ( largely discredited now in psychology ) being adopted in sociology , alongside the types of tumblr politics we see ( because it does n't matter what the content is , so long as someone says it , it sounds interesting , and it agrees with the opinions of the lecturer ) . 
  i had a full lecture at one point about how everyone carries an `` invisible knapsack '' of their privileges . 
  i think its lack of specificity may have also helped the subject , though - although they tried hard to keep it out , people of other disciplines have decided to muscle in and get involved in the debate . 
  the sociobiologists and mathematical sociologists are n't sociologists by discipline - they 're biologists and mathematicians , who simply had an interest in social behaviour and ( way more importantly for me ) decided to teach it to other sociology students on sociology courses . 
  and there are places which hired them . 
  i think this is a godsend , and hope it can be used to drag sociology as a discipline out of its regressive , suppressive , knowledge-denying , academically dishonest ways whereupon they hate anything `` scientific '' . 
   so you end up with classes full of kids who are enthusiastic about the idea , but have n't really gotten into social issues beyond your average 18 year old before uni . 
  and they 're being fed bullshit by lecturers with minimal oversight and they have to eat it up and regurgitate it out for grades . 
  there 's a few kids who are switched on and looking at the material from their own perspective , but most just accept what the teacher 's said , get their grades by nodding along , then they can slack off and get high . 
  agreed , completely . 
  that is very much the way it is . 
  to show you the quality of some of the kids , one of them watched a vegetarian documentary and tried convincing a seminar group that * broccoli has more protein than red meat * . 
  no-one , not even the lecturer , spoke up at this person who was rambling such a crazy opinion . 
  even if people disagree with it , there was no critical discussion , because we knew we all had to respect eachother 's ( in this case , blatantly wrong ) opinions . 
   if you do n't mind me asking another question , where do you think habbermas ' work falls in this ? 
  is his work also the kind of infalsifiable theory ? 
  i ask because with regards sociology , his ideas are the only ones i am familiar with . 
  oddly enough , habermas is one of the few sociologists i do n't know too much about . 
  given how he 's a social theorist , and his inspirations are said to include people like husserl , gadamer and the frankfurt school , i would be inclined to say that he would also fit into the category of infalsifiable theory , but i would have to look further into his claims . 
  if i remember correctly , he focuses a lot on language . 
  the key parts regard whether he and his adherents think language can be studied , and also how they would intend to do so . 
  it 's the whole issue of structure vs. semantics , which is something that is also a debate in linguistics - the `` scientific '' way would focus more on structure , looking at the quantity of words used , and the way in which they 're used in the context of the sentence . 
  some others , particularly those siding with theory , might use semantics - grabbing chunks of text and saying `` but what does this * mean * for the person reading it ? '' . 
  the problem is , there are no standardised methods for which generalisations can be made on semantics , and it 's all based on how a sociologist might selectively interpret it . 
  there are no formal rules around it etc. , which is where it becomes an issue , because then the question arises `` how can you definitively prove something using that method ? '' . 
  perhaps the closest you can get is asking a large sample how they interpret a certain thing , but sociologists who would do such studies tend to avoid that and just interpret it themselves with their own unsubstantiated opinion . 
  most seem to , or they otherwise ignore the parts they dislike . 
  in line with many students who adopt radical political perspectives , most people i 've met tend to be radical and left-leaning . 
  the only exception i know was a conservative , who kept his opinions * very * quiet , and avoided any topic discussion - he told me aside one time that he had strong disagreement to much of the material , `` but what can you do ? '' . 
  somewhat unsurprising , when the perspectives we 're taught literally go under titles like `` marxist '' , `` feminist '' and `` postcolonial '' . 
  the only major non-left-leaning perspective ( outside of a few founding symbolic interactionists , who have also gone somewhat out of favour ) is that of functionalism , and that died out with both the death of parsons and the 1960s counter-culture . 
  now , despite some revivalists , it is n't even seen as legitimate to use as a source .
