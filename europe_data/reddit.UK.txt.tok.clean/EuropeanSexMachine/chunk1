even the most extreme governments realise that no one wins a nuclear war . 
  the only chances of nuclear war i see happening is if terrorists like isis manage to get their hands on one . 
  do you know who else drink delicious water ? 
  i hear more people die from shark attacks than muslims in australia . 
  1m fatalities and 3m casualties in london . 
  my house is about 5 mines from the 3rd band . 
  find it funny you only linked russia :p, 
  / r/swedenmaybe ? 
  that 's because , you know , slavery . 
  must have increased the budget on state television, 
  :o : o, 
  you 're basically a loan shark to the greek people . 
  they do n't need more loans . 
  that 's how you get into even more debt . 
  is n't there already a nordic council or something similar ? 
  b-but ... think of the children !, 
  but that white blob inside the eu on maps has got ta go . 
  people vote ukip for more than just their immigration and eu policies . 
  23000 times ? 
  that 'll take a while . 
  o_o no one is saying you 're not allowed to say what you want , but you 're just being an asshole now . 
  til that have a discussion on swedish immigration and refugee policy is the equivalent of a high pitched noise . 
  i am the empress of an invisible galactic empire , which is impossible to prove does n't exist , therefore is true \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af . 
  i 've attempted to back up my statement , but so far you have n't even attempted to disprove me at all , so right now my point is more credible than yours because you have n't even tried proving your view . 
  and yet you 've have n't disproved me . 
  ultimately we 're both wrong until one of us can prove it to the other , no ? 
  i 've expressed my reasoning why it is unsustainable , which does n't seem to be enough for you , but it 's more that you 've done to prove it is sustainable . 
  can you prove to me it is sustainable ( financially , culturally , what have you ) ? 
  the second that someone can prove to me that what sweden and it 's government is doing is suitable and sensible for the long term , i 'll change my mind . 
  until then , i 'm having my doubts this is the right thing for sweden . 
  having an infinitely growing welfare bill is unsustainable because sweden is n't getting infinitely wealthier . 
  if i have a 100ml cup , i ca n't put a litre of water into it , because it 's impossible , not because it 's `` more difficult '' what are you saying ? 
  sweden should accept all refugees regardless how it might impact their economy ? 
  that ca n't possibly be sustainable . 
   just those they 've deemed refugees , like syrians rightly are . 
  you said it your self . 
  all syrians are refugees to you , and the population of syria is nearly 23 million . 
  over double that of sweden . 
  try putting every syrian in sweden and see what happens . 
  ( yes i am aware not every syrian is going to show up at sweden 's doorstep , but claiming that all syrians are refugees is quite a dangerous statement ) edit : you still have n't disputed the article . 
  well there 's data in that link , you can dispute that . 
  although those before were anecdotal , it 's basic logic that you 'll have higher taxes to foot a higher welfare bill . 
  i literally just gave you two examples , but i 'll bite ; [ here is an article from reuters . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/17/us-sweden-economy-insight-idusbrea2g0ka20140317 ) it may be fine now , but if this keeps happening the costs are going to go up , and the taxpayers who work are going to have to foot the bill , and sooner or later people are going to get irritated . 
  not to mention that the only reason the more nationalist/right wing parties in europe are getting more popular is directly proportional to the issues caused by uncontrolled immigration . 
  you can see this throughout europe , and it 's not just because of non-eu immigration and refugees , but also issues from the eu internally . 
  well economically if these refugees or immigrants are n't working , a growing welfare bill and a smaller working population wo n't do a country much good financially , culturally you have situations like the historic alfred nobell hotel in karlskoga that might possibly be destroyed to be replaced with housing to shelter these guys and that is probably being extrapolated in other places within sweden , too . 
  but it 's got to the point where it is completely unsustainable financially and culturally to take so many people into a relatively small country . 
  other eu nations should probably be helping with the refugees , sure , but i personally think we have no ` divine responsibility ' to take in everyone who wants or needs to flee their countries for economic or other reasons , aside from it probably being the morally sound thing to do . 
  yes but there is a reason it is `` swedenyes '' and not `` ukyes '' or `` germanyyes '' . 
  what i find baffling is that you guys seem to deal in absolutes when it comes to things like immigration . 
  either you have politicians going '' \u00ba\u0644\u035c\u00ba \u00ba\u0644\u035c\u00ba \u00ba\u0644\u035c\u00ba \uff25\uff36\uff25\uff32\uff39\uff2f\uff2e\uff25 \uff0c \uff27\uff25\uff34 \uff29\uff2e \uff28\uff25\uff32\uff25 \u00ba\u0644\u035c\u00ba \u00ba\u0644\u035c\u00ba \u00ba\u0644\u035c\u00ba '' or you have sd who are pretty hardcore right wing and anti-immigration . 
  all debate over the topic seems to be shunted to either complete open borders `` cultural enrichment '' or treating immigration like a cancer . 
  yay ^ ^_^, 
  i do n't really want to meet any random redditor in person . 
  how about eurovision ? 
  and hey we do very well in the olympics :(, 
  i 'd assume the reaction they 'd want would be `` look !, 
  whites are peaceful , poc bad and violent ! '', 
  or you know , people could just eat less . 
  hey if they were in hospital they 'd still be stealing healthcare . 
  hollywoods portray of both typical women and men tend to be exaggerations or far from the truth, 
  why is europe expected to babysit these people ? 
  it 's probably not morally sound , but it should n't be our issue . 
  people hate the west yet love our free shit . 
  them being all young men just gives me the impression they 're economic migrants . 
  if they were truly escaping a hellhole where are the women and children ? 
  calais is a mess right now , not sure if it 's entirely the french authorities fault , but because they are just walking around the port trying to get on trucks forcing the drivers to act as immigration officers just gives me the impression the french are n't doing anything . 
  house them or something , just do n't let them walk around a port trying to get onto ships  . , 
  which country are you from ? 
  edit : which not what, 
  that 's a really really broad question . 
  from my experience here in the uk though is that most muslims integrate well and learn english/abide by uk laws . 
  but of course you do have a very loud minority who go `` gib sharia law '' and such but the media seems to portray them as a bigger issue than they actually are . 
  ah , thanks . 
  pretty much . 
  i do n't mind the french i just wish the english was on top/bolded or something so that it is easier to read . 
  this is an english speaking website ( for the most part ) and far more people speak english here than french . 
  i do n't know , unfortunately as a south englander my dialect has certain stereotypes associated with it . 
  * bloodyeubureaucratsteatearomaniansjobsromaniansjobsfarageunbarrageteabiscuitsgolfbroadstairsmultycultyleftiesfruitcakeempirebloodytoriesbloodylabourpinkocommiegreenyislamofascistbourbonscustardcreams *, 
  mhm . 
  i mean i ca n't really comment without sounding arrogant since my native tongue is english but it comes across as non-conforming/purposely being annoying/snobbish . 
  i would n't go to a dutch speaking subreddit and start demanding people put up with my english for example . 
  i 'm glad someone else supports the scientific method to help advance human civilisation . 
  * ah 'm glad someone else supports t ' scientific meffod ta ` elp advance ` uman civilisation . 
  * i do n't blame him now . 
  this is fun . 
  thanks  * cheers m8 *, 
  that would be reasonable * m8 that wud b fuckin a blud *, 
  well it does n't help the stereotype that the french are language snobs :p, 
  * i really wish he would stop putting everything in french and then english . 
  * i really wish he would stop putting everything in french and then english . 
  edit : i think some people are misreading me ; i was n't against the idea of him writing a comment in two languages , just that english should be on top for easier reading . 
  i think the ` brain drain ' of qualified eastern european folk moving to western europe might start hitting hard back at home in a decade or so . 
  these countries are paying for citizens to get degrees and other high-leveled qualifications and yet they do n't see a return . 
  shh do n't ruin my anti-uktransit circlejerk :(, 
  a transit system that is n't dated and disgusting . 
  seriously , i get our railroads are super old and such , but every other european country i 've been do they 've been pretty on-time , clean , efficient , cheap and not crowded . 
  i 'm sorry sweden . 
  trust me , most of us in the uk do n't like hom either,
