to be fair it seems like a large change but the only major difference between 2010 and 2015 is snp and the lib dems have switched . 
  the two major parties will still have pretty much the same number of seats , just the conservatives have lost ~ 30 and labour have gained ~ 30 [ they will probably lose 20-30 seats total out of some 500 + ] . 
  ukip & greens are still as inconsequential as ever . 
  what is pretty clear is unless something drastic changes labour is the only party with a chance of winning , by creating a coalition government with snp . 
  sure this is a large change politically for the country but not in terms of who the major players are . 
  two parties are still getting overwhelmingly more seats than any other , it 's only really the nationalist parties that are making any headway . 
  ** if you look outside of scotland you will see that the two major parties are getting more seats even than they did in 2010 ** . 
  i should also note that as well as their seat share staying almost unchanged , their voting share is too ( outside of scotland ) . 
  regarding licensing price , obviously you 're going to pay more for a eu wide license as you 're going to make more money from it - the audience you 're hitting is larger . 
  the difference in price might be marginal with some languages though as they do n't have much of a market outside of a specific country anyway i suppose . 
  this would give quite an advantage for english language shows & sky for instance would get the rights to uk broadcast a fair amount cheaper than if they wanted to broadcast it in the whole of europe for instance as english language shows have more mass market appeal . 
  i see your point re : online providers , but do you think netflix would want to specialise in that way ? 
  for instance further down the line do you see netflix providing hundreds of french , german , russian , italian shows to everyone ? 
  surely if they have say # 1 billion budget for all europe they would be better off spending that money on stuff that is attractive to everyone . 
  after all they ca n't afford to buy the rights to * everything * . 
  yes it does but there is nothing stopping a company from only buying digital content that is produced in french then providing it for everyone in europe . 
  this will create more niche providers that look to only really provide to one market . 
  whereas currently netflix will show some french programming but mostly english they will switch to only providing english programming ( as that 's what the mass audience wants , and it makes sense to spend money on shows that everyone will watch , instead of only those living in france ) . 
  why television what ? 
  why will television continue to be used ? 
  it probably wo n't be in 50 + years but it will be for the next few decades . 
  tv & online distribution as well if this law comes into effect . 
  at the moment it 's not needed as they can already specialise , but this would end that . 
  hurrah !, 
  we have finally reached the point i was trying to make in my first post . 
  this leads to less regional specific shows on netflix , which would be a negative from many viewers points of view !, 
  not everything about this is positive is my point !, 
  i actually think that netflix & other media companies will start regional companies to provide digital media to only one country to get around this law while still providing a service that caters to the entirely of europe . 
  it 's inevitable because europe is n't like other joint markets , we all speak different languages so region specific shows are much more important . 
  ... we 're still not discussing the same issue . 
  i am saying that if this law went into practice netflix would not still provide the same level of programming . 
  yes they have the rights to peep show in england & ireland but if they had to buy the rights for peep show for the entirely of europe i 'm not sure they would do that . 
  they would focus on shows that have a more broad audience & there would be * less regional specific shows * . 
  what you are suggesting is that this would be business as usual for netflix & all shows currently shown in each individual netflix region would be shown everywhere , that is simply ** not ** the case . 
  tv is still the major entertainment avenue in the uk . 
  sky has four times as many subscribers as netflix does . 
  they are in direct competition . 
  were this to go forward sky would be able to provide * better regional specific * programming which would give them an unfair advantage in the uk market over netflix . 
  edit : seems impossible to create any sort of meaningful discussion without being bombarded by the downvote brigade . 
  perhaps we should all just take the same side instead of pointing out how things could be bad even if they 're ultimately good in the long run ... 
  i know there is zero logistical difference you are n't understanding my point & you still have n't tried to address the points i brought up . 
  if this law was brought forward , we would have less regional variation in programming from netflix , if you do n't believe this to be the case why not ? 
  if this law was brought forward local companies ( like sky ) would be able to better compete in each market due to not being restricted in providing for the entire region , if you do n't believe this is true , why not ? 
  i think we should start deploying more troops to eastern europe . 
  we have 20000 troops in germany at the moment due to be recalled soon . 
  how about we send those to poland & start working with the polish & other nations like france & germany to create a more unified defensive force in eastern europe . 
  these troops could easily be deployed to the baltic states to assist in any `` rebel '' uprisings and squash them immediately . 
  it applies well to online media as well as i explained & you did n't really explain why it does n't . 
  if you want to apply a law like this it should apply to all media including broadcasting , dvds , cinemas , otherwise it is not fair competition . 
  broadcasting & online are not separate markets , the same people can buy both kinds of media subscription packages . 
  bombing isis is n't going to end the war in syria . 
  the assad regime is n't even trying to recover the rest of syria iirc they just want to hold onto what they already have . 
  only way to solve the war in syria is with a political solution involving those who support assad removing him from power . 
  could n't see much to be honest , rather disappointing . 
  the solar eclipse a few months back was far more interesting . 
  too poor ( wales is the poorest region in the uk ) , same for northern ireland . 
  no doubt sturgeon will eventually get her wish & scotland will leave , i ca n't say i blame them really , scottish politics is very different to that of the rest of the uk . 
  that 's quite ok , we english subsidize the welsh , scots & northern irish anyway . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ ^ death ^ ^ ^ ^ threats . 
  to be honest i do n't think they should be given the chance for another referendum unless we left the eu or there was overwhelming support ( 70 % + ) consistently in the polls ... 
  they should n't just get to keep declaring referendums till they win . 
  well does the spanish electorate support a referendum ? 
  otherwise it 's not really surprising the government does n't support it . 
  the spanish people as whole should decide the future of their nation . 
  that 's really not overwhelming support , that 's not even enough support to win an independence referendum ... 
  this is american news not european . 
  also , how the fuck did this get up voted 13 times in 20 minutes . 
  that last panel hahaha !, 
  i just ca n't look at bears the same way since watching `` backcountry '' . 
  majestic animals but scary nonetheless . 
  that 's amusing , so how come the countries with the largest welfare states , namely france , sweden , denmark , finland , all have the highest fertility rates ? 
  france & sweden have higher fertility than america , norway around the same & finland & denmark slightly less . 
  the welfare state actually helps people have children younger too by the way , which is partly why these countries have higher fertility rates . 
  do you have free childcare in america ? 
  do most parents manage to go back to work after giving birth ? 
  can they balance work/life by working shorter hours ? 
  can they get maternity leave paid for ? 
  is having a child `` free '' in america in terms of medical expenses , or is having a child prohibitively expensive ? 
  to be honest if you [ look at the stats ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;idim=country:deu:jpn:usa&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:deu:jpn:usa:fra&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) the difference in births between the french & germans has always been there . 
  it 's slightly larger now but not massively . 
  it 's pretty good for a western country , the highest in the eu & one of the highest in the oecd . 
  i 'm not sure we should really be looking for a fertility rate above replacement tbh , that seems about perfect . 
  well sure , the op said decades not decade . 
  over the last decade gini has n't increased a huge amount you 're right . 
  yes , after the financial crash the wealthy lost a [ lot of their income ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/df96793470903ee709bd56838804eba3.png ) , but they will regain it back . 
  this does n't change [ the fact ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/5e1fe3b874b9d6aed97678498bfe0003.png ) that we have become massively more unequal over the last few decades ( since the 80s ) . 
  it 's an increase of ~ 52 % , that 's a lot in my book . 
  we went from being one of the most equal countries in the world to being on par with india . 
  although it 's not fair to say none of the wealth has been redistributed , it 's fair to say less & less has as time went on . 
  i think that was his point in his last sentence . 
  yannis problem was n't with uk austerity ( which he quite rightly suggested was n't `` real '' austerity like in greece ) . 
  as he said , he believed in well controlled public finances . 
  what he has a problem is with the tories using it as a smokescreen to reduce the size of the state & make income inequality worse ( so called `` class warfare '' as he put it ) . 
  which it will do , as they 're cutting welfare , the area that does most to reduce inequality at the same time as cutting taxes to the wealthy . 
  as an example , in the uk if you look at the ratio to earnings of the top 20 % of earners to the bottom 20 % it is 14.6 , after cash benefits are given out that ratio is 6.5 , after taxes & benefits in kind ( education / nhs ) that ratio is 3.9 . 
  the government machine does a huge amount to reduce income inequality & any cuts to that machine are going to have a disastrous effect on the poor . 
  as he said , the state is already the smallest it has been in a long time . 
  they could be raising taxes to bridge the gap but they are n't for ideological reasons , not for reasons of good public finances . 
  the gini in the uk has increased , therefore the uk is less equal . 
  does n't your image prove his point ?
