  yes because 1000 or 10000 troops stationed in baltics is going to make any difference at all if russia decides to go insane & invade europe . 
  if we really wanted to make a new defensive line in eastern europe it would take hundreds of thousands of troops & 10s of thousands of tanks , just as was the case in germany [ during the cold war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cold_war_tank_formations ) . 
  is that what you 're suggesting ? 
  [ english source for anyone wondering . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/24/angela-merkel-francois-hollande-eu-wide-response-escalating-migration-crisis ), 
  i do n't really see eu funding being cut to eastern europe . 
  i could see support for sanctions against russia being lifted however , this would benefit germany a lot especially . 
  then again , perhaps russia does n't even want western goods any more ... 
  lol , [ read more here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jedi_census_phenomenon ), 
  i 'm not convinced of this , the chinese market would have crashed regardless of the state of the economy at large - it was massively inflated . 
  even if china was growing at 10 % pa a correction was inevitable . 
  i think people on here are pretty pro military & pro empire building . 
  i think they overestimate european readiness to integrate further & the importance of conventional military strength in the 21st century . 
  they seem to favour intervention over diplomacy , which is completely antithetical to the actions of most states within europe . 
  i do n't think they have faith in european military power , actually quite the opposite they 'd rather we spend far more & rely too much on america ( something i disagree with personally ) . 
  it 's the same on other uk boards i frequent ( / r/unitedkingdom / r/ukpolitics ) , so i 'm not sure if it 's just the young demographic is more pro military . 
  i 'm not convinced it 's a right / left issue as / r/uk is pretty left wing , then again / r/europe & / r/ukpolitics are definitely right leaning , the former more than the latter . 
  i would presume that 's due to low bond rates , there 's no point paying off the debt when you could save the money & earn higher interest rates than on the debt you 're servicing . 
  the point of the money is the same however & it 's not being used to grow your economy ( either through tax reductions or stimulus ) which is the main point here . 
  yes agreed there , not that i 'm against meat farming but it 's definitely a separate discussion from the one here . 
  i was referring to [ this imf discussion paper ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1510.pdf ) on the subject of countries post 2009 , their high debts & whether the cost of reduction through surplus is worth it . 
  sorry i could n't link when i posted the comment as i was on mobile . 
  as noted in the paper : * `` second , if fiscal space remains ample , policies to deliberately pay down debt are normatively undesirable . 
  the reason is that for such countries , the distortive cost of policies to deliberately pay down the debt is likely to exceed the crisis-insurance benefit from lower debt . 
  in such cases , debt-to-gdp ratios should be reduced organically through growth , or opportunistically when less distortionary sources of revenue are available . 
  '' * as in the paper , germany is very much a [ green zone ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/f3060a1fd37c22f60e23e16dc34f89ff.png ) candidate for this policy . 
  moreover further spending in germany could help improve the exports of neighbouring nations that do n't have the fiscal space germany affords . 
  more domestic demand in germany ( say through vat reductions ) is good for europe as whole . 
  this is just another argument for hunting wild animals imo . 
  you 're not artificially inflating their numbers like you are with livestock , you 're reducing their numbers while still keeping them sustainable ( ie not endangered ) . 
  it 's very strategic , they can easily launch operations anywhere in the middle east & north or central africa from there . 
  it 's also strategic in the sense that they 're a major player in the region with by far the largest military investment , having them on side is very important for american foreign policy in the middle east . 
  yes perhaps that was bad wording on my part , more what i meant was their & our foreign policy in the region did n't align . 
  their sponsoring of hezbollah & hamas for example . 
  diplomatic relations between iran & america at least have been non existent for a long time too . 
  edit : this is mostly from an american perspective by the way , i could n't give a crap about the uk & sa relations . 
  saudi arabia is a naturally ally due to their oil wealth , strategic position and military expertise . 
  sometimes you have to ally yourself with people you 're culturally different to , keeping them on side is more important . 
  that being said , similar statements could be said about iran , the problem there is their overt hatred towards the west and state sponsored funding of terrorism . 
  germany is a [ long way from their debt limit ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1510.pdf ) , there is no reason to run a surplus . 
  even if there was another crash you are well prepared compared to other economies . 
  the uk . 
  i hate the weather , that is all . 
  if i had the money i 'd probably move to an overseas territory like bermuda or turks & caicos . 
  so i guess we all should just become vegetarian then ? 
  i agree with koldt i really do n't see the difference here , if anything breeding animals simply to kill them is worse . 
  depends if there are crises within africa , if there is not there wo n't be many coming here . 
  the current numbers are only so high due to problems in the middle east & a few african countries . 
  once these crises are cleaned up the flow will decrease . 
  further development in africa in the coming decades will decrease the flow further too . 
  the main issue for germany at least [ seems to be kosovo ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/bd/five_main_citizenships_of_first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_1st_quarter_2015.png ) , you get a ridiculous number of applications from there & they [ almost all get denied . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/6/64/first_instance_decisions_by_outcome_and_recognition_rates%2c_30_main_citizenships_of_asylum_applicants_granted_decisions_in_the_eu-28%2c_1st_quarter_2015.png ) i mean those figures are ridiculous , in q1 2015 there were 12780 decisions & only 175 were positive . 
  if the number of people coming from kosovo declined germany could much better deal with people that actually have proper asylum claims . 
  same issue with serbia & albania to a lesser extent , 8440 asylum decisions & 85 positive decisions in serbia , 11 % positive decisions in albania . 
  these intra european claimants actually seem to be the real problem as far as i can see , the middle eastern & african applicants have much better success rates with their asylum claims . 
  [ denmark is slightly higher ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/f/fb/price_level_index_for_4_groups_of_goods_and_services%2c_2014%2c_eu-28%3d100_table_nr_2.png ) , germany is second in the eu . 
  this is for energy sources combined mind you , it may be different just for electricity . 
  [ this seems to mostly be due to taxes . 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/eaa21705a9db8c589fe79d6d06a65c7c.png ) the question is , why is the base price so low in germany & so high in the uk ? 
  oh really ? 
  then why have n't i commented on any threads directly related to immigration in days ? 
  i try to avoid the refugee related threads , i have keyword filters setup . 
  unfortunately that does n't help when i 'm on mobile or people infiltrate non immigration related threads with immigration discussion . 
  how about you , do you read & post on other topics or just immigration ? 
  filters do n't work on mobile . 
  the megathreads are n't subjective , that 's why they work , everything gets put there . 
  the topic is n't going to die out & i 'll explain why . 
  immigration is always going to be an issue , perhaps less of one in a few years but it will still be an issue . 
  as the front page becomes more about immigration it will attract a certain user base & repel users not interested in discussing it ( like me to a certain extent , i do n't mind a few threads on the topic ) . 
  so when the topic is n't such an issue any more the demographics of the sub are so changed it stays an issue . 
  nevermind new users you 're also assuming the user base not interested in the topic will stick around for the next years while this issue dies down . 
  how else can they work against flooding or spamming the sub other than removing submissions . 
  either you accept the sub is going to be full of threads on one topic or you start limiting the number that can appear . 
  indeed it 's not about immigration , yet people decide to make it about immigration . 
  you have proven my point . 
  there are many other threads where this happens , because these people only post about one topic . 
  ok so i will go find 10 topics that are vaguely related to immigration & spam this sub with them . 
  you ca n't see why that is a problem ? 
  i 'm not asking you to ignore reality , only to manage the situation & make sure the sub forum does n't get flooded with shitposts or posts on one topic . 
  also note filters do n't work on mobile , that 's my main gripe with this whole mess . 
  so look into getting 5 moderators that simply deal with immigration threads , what 's the problem ? 
  essentially what you 're saying is that people that are n't interested in discussing immigration should leave this sub . 
  the forum is slowly going to turn from / r/europe into / r/european within no time at all , it 's already getting worse every day . 
  the megathreads worked fine , i do n't know why you stopped using them . 
  unless you want the front page to forever be 50 % + migrant related you need to do * something . 
  * i mean as users are we just suppose to accept that almost every thread is going to be hijacked by people that want to talk about immigration ? 
  what 's the point of us even viewing this forum anymore . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i3b9h/the_future_of_the_worlds_population_in_4_charts/ ) is a perfect example , read the ops comments , he is obviously pushing an agenda here . 
  i mean it is not even a new article & the information has been posted here before . 
  what . 
  a leftist approach would be more direct investment in africa , speeding up development & lowering fertility rates . 
  it 's the leftist parties that are pushing for higher developmental aid targets . 
  it 's the right wing parties that are calling for a reduction in developmental aid that will only prolong the process of westernization . 
  well nigeria is a net food importer at the moment although they 're beginning to fix the problem ( they import a lot of food that they could produce domestically ) . 
  that being said , research suggests sub saharan africa is going to [ lose the most amount ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/climate_change_to_shift_global_spread_quality_agricultural_land_403na1_en.pdf ) of arable land of any region due to climate change . 
  it 's also going to be impossible for them not to be net food importers just based upon their size , if current projections are correct they 'd have a pop density [ similar to palestine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density ) at ~ 750 per sq km . 
  really it all depends upon future technology & farming efficiency plus how quickly they can grow economically to keep up with food costs . 
  pretty impossible to predict how food production will work in the future , it may be viable to use vertical farming , at which point the sky 's the limit really .
