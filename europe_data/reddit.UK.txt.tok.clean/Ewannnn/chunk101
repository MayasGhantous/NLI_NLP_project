  are you one of those people that wishes for disasters just to watch the carnage from your computer screen ? 
  it 's sick to be honest . 
  i do n't know , but i 'd rather not find out . 
  this guy seems like he wants to roll the dice just to see how many crazy things trump can do . 
  this is insane . 
   with little risk of being negatively effected . 
  how do you see this as the case ? 
  if the american economy tanks we 'll all be affected in some way . 
  remember that the 2008 financial crisis was almost exclusively an american caused crisis that spilled over to the rest of the world . 
  [ hofer seems to have got a majority almost everywhere : x ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/f4a3f262645c4ac02247443ce47834f8.png ), 
  they usually go hand in hand , notice that trump is n't running on the democratic platform . 
  they 're less educated because they 're old . 
  this trend will reduce over time as today 's young ( that are better educated ) get older and become more conservative . 
  it 's not because they 're stupid , it 's just a demographic issue . 
  were n't our dairy farmers complaining recently that they do n't get paid enough ? 
  i suppose this explains why . 
  being linked to the global economy is n't so bad , world growth is consistently far higher than in the west and will continue to be the case far into the future . 
  so for instance during and after the crisis germany has benefitted a lot from this while other countries that primary export to the eu or rely more on domestic consumption ( that has slumped a lot ) have suffered . 
  germany gets its way in the eu because other countries think in the same way as they do . 
  if they did n't germany would n't get their way , kinda like britain ( although granted most decisions are still made by consensus , britain just happens to be the country most at odds with the rest ) . 
  it 's because italy is much more domestic consumption driven than germany . 
  46 % of gdp in 2014 were exports of goods and services in germany , while for italy that figure was only 30 % . 
  so during the financial crisis germany could afford for consumers to be buying fewer products because they could still export to asia and other parts of the world as the above poster pointed out . 
  looking at it now czech currency has n't devalued much ? 
  i mean in the last 5 years czk has gone from 24.5 czk to 27 per euro . 
  i 'd hardly call that much of a devaluation . 
  this is a recent trend too , historically speaking the euro has consistently devalued against czk , for instance in the early 2000s there were 38 czk to the eur . 
  two years does n't increase your wages by 45 % . 
  these are just nominal figures though , your money will go further in ireland than the uk . 
  to be fair you could say this for most countries . 
  if we just include london and the south east britain becomes a lot more wealthy too . 
  if we just include nrw , bavaria and baden-wurttemberg germany becomes much more wealthy etc. 
  it is but only because in the 4th quarter they grew by 0.1 % . 
  first quarter fall was 12 % then 2 % then 3.7 % . 
  note the previous year ( 2008 ) the economy fell by 11 % too ( annualized ) . 
  they did n't invest them in government bonds ? 
  christ if the green belt is still around in 2050 london is going to be one packed city . 
  [ missing white woman syndrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/missing_white_woman_syndrome ) . 
  the madeline mccann case is especially ridiculous in this regard , the amount of money they spent trying to find her is crazy . 
  interesting that the polish are even close to us , their fertility rate is only 1.3 compared to 1.9 in the uk . 
  it seems young polish women much prefer to have kids than older ones . 
  no doubt he was probably drunk when he made the statement anyway . 
  pretty much , just a case of saying something that can be seen as bad when quoted out of context . 
  the title is used purposefully to cause outrage . 
  south korea relied heavily and still rely heavily on trade that is my point . 
  you ca n't close yourself off from the world and expect to be successful . 
  south korea grew so fast for completely the opposite reason ? 
  like all the asian tigers trade was the main reason for their growth . 
  north korea ? 
  no other obvious examples come to mind . 
  it 's pretty hit and miss , good chance the voting form wo n't arrive to you before the vote even takes place . 
  no i did n't , i just said that people born in ni are british by birth , which they are . 
  / r/britishproblems, 
  tell me about it , i think i triggered a whole subreddit there . 
  why the fuck do the aussies call it soccer . 
  we should kick them out of the commonwealth for this . 
  to be fair france has n't reduced their budget at all . 
  in 2009 they were spending 56.8 % of gdp , in 2015 they are spending 57 % of gdp , essentially no change . 
  revenue has increased quite a lot due to higher taxes though , 49.6 % in 2009 and 53.2 % in 2015 .

  you 're actually quite right they 're similar on policy i think . 
  but as a character they 're quite different , blair is much more charismatic than clinton ( hillary ) is . 
  blair 's one of the best electioneers we 've ever had . 
  it actually is the reason , they were worried about the independence of key polish institutions ( primarily the constitutional court and public broadcaster ) . 
  i remember reading the report when it came out .

  poland stronk, 
  [ this is my tag of you . 
  not sure why russia is so high these days , we do n't really discuss ukraine anymore . 
  perhaps it 's russian trolls . 
  germany - refugee crisis uk - brexit italy - refugee crisis , libya , eu integration ( renzi ) sweden - refugee crisis turkey - refugee crisis most of these are related to the refugee crisis in some way apart from the uk and russia . 
  the issue was indeed that borrowing costs in other countries would rise , but the ecb and ez countries have ways to deal with that ( if nothing else the ecb could just buy italian bonds for instance themselves ) . 
  they would just need to signal that they would not let any other country leave the eurozone and would do whatever it takes to save them . 
  for anyone that wants proper data , the median in the uk is # 21,900 pa before tax . 
  so 2,370 eur per month . 
  this is for individuals not households . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/percentile-points-from-1-to-99-for-total-income-before-and-after-tax ) . 
   sure , but the us and uk in dollar amounts of `` value '' that external debt obligations have are leading the pack . 
  not in terms of government debt , japan far surpasses the uk . 
  if you 're talking about private debt that 's kind of meaningless , it 's due to our massive financial services industry . 
  even luxembourg has more private debt than japan does for instance ... 
  no one mentioned it surprisingly so just one more thing to add , japan has their own currency they control while greece does not . 
  this means japan can set their interest rates and control their monetary policy to most benefit their economy . 
  greece can not do this . 
  if worst comes to worst japan can also print their way out of debt , they literally can not go insolvent like greece could . 
  the japanese central bank for instance has been buying japanese stocks and government bonds for ages , their asset portfolio is in the trillions of dollars currently ( for instance at the end of 2014 it was 60 % of gdp , compared to 20 % for the euro area ) . 
  i do n't think so , someone posted a list before of banks exposure to greek debt . 
  outside of greek banks the exposure was tiny , not in absolute value but in relation to the size of the banks themselves . 
  they would n't have had issues i do n't think .

  economists look at how automation affects the labour market , i 've seen quite a few papers on this subject . 
  for instance , see [ here ] ( http://personal.lse.ac.uk/manning/work/explainingjobpolarization.pdf ) and notice that the results seem to suggest quite the opposite to what you 're suggesting . 
  namely that automation is bringing about more low-income low skill jobs and more high skill high-income jobs , see table 2 at the bottom . 
  this is happening all across the developed world . 
  for where we 're likely to be in the future autor discusses [ this here .

  yeah but they 're buying these properties as investments they 're not actually living in them .
