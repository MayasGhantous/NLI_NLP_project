  yes & no , a larger population will mean nigeria has to import more food . 
  if food starts increasing in value , for example due to climate change , they may struggle to feed their growing population . 
  it 's just a median estimate based upon life expectancy & fertility projections , there 's a [ large scope ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/fe1e822f0959594f64bad8ad4798e6df.png ) for variation . 
  i 'm not sure if they account food production though , i would too be interested to hear someone that knows more about these kinds of studies . 
  interesting [ report on the matter here ] ( http://www.prb.org/publications/reports/2001/understandingandusingpopulationprojections.aspx ) if you 're interested in reading about it . 
  i prefer megathreads or some kinda quota where threads just get deleted after so many reach the front page . 
  the reason being that tags & filters do nothing for mobile , so you 're lumped with more than half the front page being migrant related . 
  it would n't bother me if this was a short term problem but it 's not , the sub is now pretty much forever going to be this way . 
  if i wanted to read about freaking migrants i 'd go to / r/european , this subreddit is suppose to be about more than one topic . 
  something also needs to be done about the rampant downvoting . 
  these immigration threads do n't even have discussion within them , but rather circlejerking about how evil migrants are . 
  it 's becoming like in the defaults where if you post any comment that does n't follow the hive you 'll be buried . 
  i mostly agree with this . 
  i would say the bbc has a slight right wing bias on reporting however as the country does itself . 
  the bbc just reports what is popular in other news & that tends to be more right wing stuff as our media in general is more right wing . 
  this is n't an institutional problem with the bbc but rather our media at large . 
  so you said you 'd watch the immigration situation . 
  so why are 9/25 threads on the front page directly ( 14/25 counting threads not directly related but where discussion is immigrant focused ) related to this ? 
  why do threads with nothing to do with migrants somehow become about migrants ? 
  why does any post positive about migrants get downvoted to oblivion , how is this not agenda pushing ? 
  this forum is dying a slow death & you 're not doing anything about it . 
  what 's more this is n't going to end , immigration is n't a short term issue . 
  the front page is forever now going to be full about articles on the topic of immigration . 
  any sort of filtering wo n't work either , i already use filters at home but it does n't work for mobile . 
  useless . 
  mi6 = cia mi5 = fbi gchq = nsa in terms of their roles . 
  res  res settings console  filters  keywords obviously does n't work for mobile !, 
  i have migrant , immigrant , refugee , deport filtered . 
  they will when 50 % or more of their population is permanently unemployed . 
  this is perhaps many decades away however . 
  haha try to tell the conservatives in my country that . 
  foodbank usage is increasing massively here , it 's pretty horrible . 
  fullfacts [ take on the report . 
  ] ( https://fullfact.org/factcheck/education/england_not_named_second_worst_nation_world_child_happiness-47334 ) as they note : * `` in 2012 , 84 % of 15 year olds reported they were happy at school in the oecd 's international pisa survey , compared to an average of 80 % in the 34 oecd member countries looked at . 
  this asked more of an overview question about happiness and satisfaction at school rather than the specific aspects asked about in the children 's society survey . 
  '' * so other surveys show differing results . 
  plus things are n't all bad : * `` on this basis , children in england were most satisfied with relationships with family members who they did n't live with , money and possessions , friendships , and local police . 
  '' * however , * `` what they were relatively unsatisfied with was relationships with their teachers , their body , the way they look , and their self-confidence . 
  '' * which does n't really surprise me at all having a sister that is 15 . 
  i 'm quite glad it was n't as bad when i was growing up ( i 'm 26 ) , social media & selfie culture has made everyone incredibly self conscious these days . 
  build more houses , the answer is simple . 
  only 2 % of land in england even has things built on it , there is plenty of space but we choose not to use it as the government likes to pump up the housing market . 
  read through [ this page ] ( https://fullfact.org/factchecks/immigration_jobs_wages-28674 ) , the situation is quite complex & many [ see [ here ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/9b22e91539a15b0dbe7473c8a204586e.png ) , [ here ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/e794a86ca5a1bd2ae165d6f15b22b488.png ) , [ here ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/90e4200c36dd13d06f284a4b4f78a2b2.png ) ] studies find no link at all between migrants & falling wages . 
  those that do find a link show a very very minor effect on wages . 
  some also show an increase in avg wages as you can see . 
  some are , they just have to be located in the atlantic north of the tropic of cancer as i recall .

  why do we need to spend more on military to defend eastern europe ? 
  why do we want to spend anything close to america on military , of the top 10 military spenders america spends more than the other 9 countries combined . 
  the amount they spend is ridiculous & not needed at all for european defense . 
  who are we even defending against ? 
  why do we need to spend more to defend against russia , their spending is only marginally more even than the uk . 
  why does it matter if the world `` leaves us behind '' ? 
  i presume you 're referring to nominal gdp . 
  we can still be wealthy states in our own right . 
  nominal gdp is just a measure of population essentially not individual wealth of the citizens within those countries . 
  china has surpassed america now in terms of gdp ( ppp ) , but chinese citizens are still a long ways off being as rich as those in america . 
  indeed most of the richest countries in the world are small . 
  i 'm not sure why you think bigger is necessarily better . 
  you can have a bigger stick i suppose , but to change anything is very difficult as the bureaucracy is massive . 
  as i said to you before , i do n't wish for appeasement but i also do n't wish to escalate the conflict militarily as i do n't believe that will help anyone . 
  [ russian exports to eu ] ( https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/explore/tree_map/hs/export/rus/show/all/2012/ ) were around $ 300 billion in 2012 & imports around $ 180 billion . 
  they 're a [ very important ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/7298946f381ee8c4ded5d246b91f96c7.png ) trade partner for the eu . 
  russia is also the [ largest supplier of eu energy requirements ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/ff6e663f912ef8cacdbea68dc05654ab.png ) , supplying 39 % of external gas imports , 36 % of crude oil imports & 28.8 % of solid fuel imports . 
  we ca n't supply that from anywhere else & the reliance is only going to grow long term with the [ size of the proven reserves ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/1eacbaa199f056b810c0513d8e3aefb6.png ) at russia 's disposal . 
  norwegian production will slow over time , like it has in the uk . 
  not really , at least going by [ this article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_syrian_civil_war ) there is very little involvement from the west . 
  in iraq of course the situation is different . 
  not just the border towns but the millions in other parts of the eu trading with russia . 
  not to mention all the businesses and consumers that rely on russian gas we ca n't get from anywhere else . 
  i agree with this , the amount the uk is giving is not nearly enough . 
  we 've spent less than a billion since 2009 while local countries like lebanon are spending billions per year and their unemployment is skyrocketing . 
  why ca n't you deport them ? 
  african migrants are harder to deport i accept but balkan migrants should be easy no ? 
  is n't france arming the rebels against assad ? 
  iirc france is the only eu country involved in the syrian civil war . 
  of course we also have the fact that without the war in iraq isis would n't exist . 
  you should have just done european capitals , that would have been much more interesting :-\\ you should also stick to one colour , why switch to purple & not just keep it all blue ? 
  not to mention this colour scheme would be a nightmare to some people with colorblindness . 
  we also had that [ copyright thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_panorama#european_union ) about taking photos of buildings too !, 
  ridiculous !, 
  no , the sanctions are the right approach , military escalation does n't really help anyone . 
  that 's hardly what we 're doing . 
  as i said , times are different , i 'd rather we did n't go back to the cold war . 
  the cold war was a different time , nato had hundreds of thousands of troops stationed in west germany . 
  unless we 're looking at similar numbers in baltic states it 's not going to make a blind bit of difference in a large scale conflict . 
  well western europe & especially germany are trying hard to deescalate the situation with russia , stationing troops on their border kinda does the opposite of this . 
  also , if there ever was to be a ww3 baltic states would be conquered by russia in no time military bases or no military bases . 
  i 'm not sure it 's really much of a deterrent if i 'm honest . 
  we 'd all probably have to suffer through a nuclear winter mind you !, 
  ttip is there to reduce these non tariff barriers to trade , allowing us to trade with our two largest markets under the same regulations . 
  at least from a uk perspective we 're against it because it seems like escalation , at least that 's the reason our defense secretary gave . 
  we do n't want russia massing troops on the border with baltics in response . 
  even if it 's shrinking in recent years the eu is still and always will be the uks largest single market . 
  it 's good for us if other countries follow eu regulations via free trade deals so that we do n't need to follow multiple standards . 
  i knew we 'd be top before even checking it . 
  i guess i have that much confidence in our scientific institutions . 
  within the eu netherlands has a massive trade surplus , more than any other country , ireland is second . 
  outside the eu the netherlands has a trade deficit while ireland still has a massive surplus ( largest of any country ) .
