  see [ this link ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/intra-eu_trade_in_goods_-_recent_trends ) for more info . 
  you can find the most recent data in the report linked in this thread ofc , just divide the exports/imports to see , for instance intra eu trade balance for ireland jan-jun 15 was 1.44 ( ie exports are 144 % of imports ) . 
  for germany that figure was 112 % & for netherlands 188 % . 
  for reference , [ netherlands ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/netherlands/current-account-to-gdp ) , [ ireland ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/current-account-to-gdp ) , [ germany . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/current-account-to-gdp ) i 'll try to find figures for trade within the eu . 
  edit : [ trade balance within the eu ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/3fc5c56aa515e26e03eee5ab0ef88785.png ) , more info [ here .

  strange thing about france , only around [ 8 % ] ( http://www.worker-participation.eu/national-industrial-relations/countries/france ) of the working population is actually unionised yet they have one if the worst problems with striking in europe . 
  on the other end of the spectrum around 74 % of the finnish workforce is unionised & in my country it is around 26 % . 
  i agree , the euro has allowed many states to have artificially lower interest rates than they would have otherwise . 
  the current crisis is causing german rates to be lower than they would be however . 
  it has everything to do with greece . 
  when the financial crisis happened interest rates plummeted everywhere . 
  partly due to low central bank rates but partly because investors were looking for a safe place to put their money . 
  the same is happening here , if you 're an investor right now where is the safest place to invest in europe ? 
  indeed what is this bullshit scaremongering the last couple of days . 
  i know his personal views but the person i responded to suggested they would be labour party policy under his leadership . 
  again there is no proof of this to my knowledge . 
  this is nonsense . 
  do you have any source for him stating we would leave nato or disarm within his term in office ( ie it would be in his manifesto ) ? 
  as far as i 've read he just would n't renew trident which means we would n't go non nuclear till 2070 , by which point he would be long dead . 
  i mean jesus are you next going to be telling me the tories are for hanging , against gay marriage , for privatising the nhs , the list goes on , just because some of their members believe in that . 
  the only thing on that list that would be in a corbyn manifesto would be railway renationalisation , which as it happens is supported by most people in britain . 
  this is a no brainer really . 
  some borders are more difficult to police than others but everyone within the eu is affected due to schengen . 
  the problematic border countries tend to be less rich than the northern states too . 
  is it just me or does that hat look awkwardly positioned upon australia 's head ? 
  also to bear in mind the effect benefits have on the income distribution . 
  that 's not shown in the graphs on this page . 
  for example , the bottom 20 % percentile in the uk earns # 5521 per annum & the top 20 % earns # 80803 per annum for a ratio of 14.6:1 . 
  however after cash benefits this ratio changes to 6.5:1 & after taxes & benefits in kind ( education , healthcare etc ) this ratio changes to 3.9:1 for a final income of # 15504 & # 60027 .

  culturally we 're obviously very close to all the ex main colonies / overseas territories of america , canada , australia , nz , ireland . 
  politically i do n't feel at all similar to america though perhaps the others to a certain extent . 
  within the eu bar ireland i probably feel most culturally similar to germany & my politics is most heavily aligned with the nordic states . 
  i suppose now is a bad time to link [ this comic ? 
  fair , but why is nit communist ? 
  you 're still working within a free market capitalist system . 
  you would n't need ( and could n't implement ) an nit within a communist state by the very nature of that philosophy . 
  haha negative income tax is n't communist , milton friedman was an early proponent of it & was a staunch capitalist . 
  it obviously would n't work within the eu with such huge differences in income though . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/d115eb252586287f242a98dabe4b88bf.png ) is the current state of compliance within the eu for anyone wondering . 
  i suppose they 're looking to change their mto of 0 % structural balance by 2016 . 
  a lot of states are n't in compliance at the moment ( italy is n't one of them though ! ) . 
  only ez states need to comply .

  basic income or negative income tax . 
  first we 'd need to kick out all the countries east of germany though . 
  do n't be silly , we do n't actually read these things , we just wait to be told by the media in small sound bites about how outraged we should be . 
  damn , shame this new tpp deal will bring down the working standards in the whole asia region !, 
  stupid america bringing down standards for everyone all over the world . 
  well of course , the irs will go after you for taxes if you do n't even live in america any more . 
  the only way to escape us taxes is to renounce your citizenship !, 
  they do give deductions for taxes paid in other jurisdictions though .

  it 's happening do n't worry : world fertility [ 2010-15 ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/66292069a892b96e0c557ab8582e1dad.png ) , [ 2050-55 ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/7471c74d6b98729b6b0fe175f599689e.png ) , [ 2095-100 ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/34d2143a52d4ad7aab654bed90c8572a.png ) . 
  world population wo n't stabilize till living standards do , which is going to take another 50-100 years . 
  to get past paywall use incognito mode . 
  to look at figures see the un page [ here . 
  ] ( http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/ ) this is really fascinating data to look at !, 
  quite , it will happen slowly over the coming decades but it will still happen . 
  people are going to have to get to grips with not needing to work any more & governments are going to have to be ready for the potential consequences to that . 
  it 's easy to embrace technology when it is n't making 20 % + of your workforce unemployable , i was more referring to further down the line when this happens . 
  with the american work ethic what it is learning to cope with perpetual unemployment is going to be difficult . 
  some of the more laid back economies in europe will deal better with this transition i feel . 
  with automation soon heavily hitting employment it might be a good time to start learning to cope with unemployment tbh . 
  with the work culture in the us this is going to hit you hard i think , there will be a lot of resistance and pointless jobs created to prop up the system . 
  i would n't be so sure of that , iran has a long history of state sanctioned funding of terrorist organisations . 
  there may be rich saudi citizens doing the same but it 's not state policy like in iran . 
  it 's not , unless you call it democratic if all you can vote for is people chosen by the ayatollah , in which case china is a democracy too . 
  it 's basically a muslim theocracy . 
  1st & 2nd are amazing, 
  biggest selling points for manchester is the jobs market is good , house prices are low compared to london & the peak district is right next door . 
  great place to live if you like outdoor sports . 
  why do you need green spaces ? 
  manchester is like 30 minutes from the peak district . 
  if you live in london you almost never see anything green that is n't man made . 
  sneaky american , say he hates his country so all the europoors defend it for him . 
  london is pretty shit if you do n't have a good job to be honest . 
  the city is ridiculously expensive , polluted , traffic is terrible . 
  manchester is much cheaper & is right next to the peak district , much nicer place to live in many ways . 
  i think the difference is the greek crisis was a developing story . 
  there were only new non mega thread topics when something new happened . 
  outside of this discussion was limited to the mega thread . 
  i 'm sure if there is a major immigration related event more threads will be allowed . 
  you 're right , i think i just changed my mind on this issue . 
  fuck immigration or any other issue that destroys the front page , let 's just have a regularly updated ( once per day ) mega tread for them all . 
  people will eventually adjust , and it works fine for discussion anyway . 
  agreed within the thread they might get 50 up votes tops which really is n't many people . 
  if reddit is anything like the rest of the internet the majority of traffic is going to be mobile based . 
  that 's a good point , it would n't even need to be a tax on unoccupied properties but on all . 
  of course part of the problem in london is fucking council tax still using evaluations from the 90s when house prices were tiny compared to what they are now . 
  many areas in london would be in higher tax property bands now if they were reevaluated . 
  that 's not a long term solution though . 
  i mean just ask americans how well that works with mexico ... and mexico is even willing to accept them back !,
