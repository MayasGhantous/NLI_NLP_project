  my problem is the discussion always essentially goes the same way . 
  lock out all the immigrants , they 're destroying our culture 2 . 
  let them drown 3 . 
  send them back is responded with 4 . 
  we ca n't let them drown , that 's not the right thing to do 5 . 
  we ca n't send them back , we do n't know where they came from 6 . 
  even if we know where they came from they might be persecuted is responded with 1 . 
  ok i agree with you 2 . 
  so lock them up , or stop them entering in the first place is responded with 1 . 
  see point 3 , we ca n't prevent them entering as to send them back would be to allow them to be persecuted the eventual compromise is agreeing we need somewhere safe to send them & the discussion is over . 
  then people argue about what caused it & why they 're all young men yada yada same old shit . 
  so pointless , just people scoring cheap karma with the same points over & over again . 
  it 's the same with any repeated topics , greece for instance . 
  when comparing with germany the differences are created by population growth , that was my point . 
  on a per capita basis we have done worse . 
  no i 'm not , i showed you two figures , both the first three years & the years between 2009 & today . 
  in both sets of figures germany does far better than the uk ( 4.9 vs 11.4 % , 1.9 vs 8 % ) . 
  if you look at growth over the last three years the uk does better , but we were n't talking about the last three years we were talking about since 2009 . 
  despite this germany is still doing better than the uk , as you can see from the previous figures ( 4.9 vs 11.4 ) . 
  i was n't talking about nominal values i was talking about growth in per capita income . 
  it is , but it still has n't closed it , which was my point !, 
  germany is still doing better * despite * our recent good performance !, 
  uk gdp growth is created due to our increase in population , it does n't mean we 're getting any richer . 
  if the german population had increased at the same rate as the uk post crisis it would be way way higher than the uk at the moment . 
  since 2009 the german population has actually decreased by 1 million while ours has increased by 5 million . 
  this inevitably means we will eventually catch germany up in terms of nominal gdp ( we 're projected to be the most populous country in europe by 2050 ) . 
  it does n't suggest we will become as rich as germany however , since 2009 ( lowest point ) our per capita gdp ( ppp ) has increased by 4.9 % while in germany it has increased by 11.4 % . 
  this while suffering through a eurozone crisis . 
  in the first three years germany saw growth of 8 % while the uk saw * growth of 1.9 % . 
  the current batch of young adults are going to get screwed while they 're young then screwed again when they 're old . 
  such is life not being born in a baby boom . 
  our only hope is technology making our lives better . 
  hopefully we 'll head towards abundance & not the dystopian future filmmakers like to portray so often . 
  what . 
  how can an english person say this ? 
  you know our papers have absolutely no qualms demonizing immigrants * whatsoever . 
  * neither do the conservatives or ukip either !, 
  well we had the crash in the 90s too let 's not forget that . 
  but yes , hopefully we 'll see 20 years of growth at least !, 
  hopefully the ez will get their shit together too ( that seems to be the case , they 've been in growth for over a year now ) , that should help us speed along . 
  france recovered [ much better after the crash ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/gdp-per-capita-ppp ) but remained stagnant since 2012 . 
  germany [ recovered much better ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-per-capita-ppp ) & is still doing better . 
  spain is doing bad , as is italy although that may be the southern side dragging down the figures . 
  [ uk figures by comparison . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-per-capita-ppp ), 
  some eu economies did much better , america did better , but some eu economies are doing considerably worse ( mostly s. europe ) . 
  means we might be a approaching a crash soon if [ history is any marker ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/b98241b4b0fe26b7f7ac61143dcecfa2.png ) ... hopefully we 'll see a repeat of the 90s to late 2000s growth period at least ... another crash like in 2009 may very well [ finish us all off !, 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/government-debt-to-gdp ), 
  it 's a recent change , europe has been in recession for years . 
  let 's hope the growth continues though , that 's good for britain too !, 
  growth is always a good thing . 
  what 's annoying is when people start playing politics & drawing conclusions around figures like this ( unemployment is another ) . 
  growth is expected whoever is in power , aside from collapses every so often we 'll always see growth . 
  it 's one of the things that is consistent whoever is in power . 
  perhaps growth is better ( than it naturally would be ) due to tory policies , neither i nor anyone else on this sub are qualified enough to comment on that !, 
  that 's hardly surprising no ? 
  from a left wing perspective tory policies are pretty much always going to look bad . 
  also the greens are bashed everywhere as a loony party so that does n't seem true . 
  labour equally are n't always praised , i 've voiced a lot of anti labour views on there & have n't been downvoted . 
  * most * right wing views tend to be downvoted though , you 're right about that . 
  it 's a shame , but that 's reddit for you . 
  this subreddit is no different . 
  what . 
  in any immigration thread all pro migrant or neutral comments are downvoted massively . 
  all anti immigrant rhetoric is up voted . 
  if anything your demographic is the worst at trying to hide dissenting opinions . 
  if you were n't you would n't use the downvote button so liberally . 
  edit : way to prove my point guys !, 
  haha !, 
  as long as they repost the thread every day i do n't see the big deal . 
  the comments in every immigration thread are the same anyway . 
  check back to this thread over the coming days , i guarantee you the comments will be almost carbon copies of each other . 
  he 's right about brigading too . 
  not to say that 's the only reason these posts get upvoted , but people here do tend to be more against immigration than the general population for sure . 
  not that it 's an issue in & of itself , but it becomes one when the same issue gets spammed continuously , so i can totally understand the mods pov here . 
  i 'm filtering the words `` migrant '' , `` refugee '' , `` immigrant '' on / r/europe at the moment . 
  all threads with those words included in the title are hidden to me . 
  it 's why the spamming does n't really bother me , i can hide whatever i want . 
  was getting tired with having the same arguments over & over again . 
  wtf , varoufakis is married to [ kim raver ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3kmtnfn.jpg ) ? 
   with an american victory in 2011 . 
  -  american victory . 
  does anyone want to tell him ? 
  european foreign aid could [ easily easily pay for it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_governments_by_development_aid ) that money is probably used elsewhere at the moment though i suppose . 
  it 's funny , the [ uk spent 13 times more ] ( http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/documents-reveal-uk-spent-13-times-more-bombing-libya-rebuilding-it-1532581617 ) bombing libya than helping it afterwards for instance . 
  you 'd think we could at least help out these countries after bombing them back into the stone age . 
  our government wants to get involved in bombing syria now too ( because we 're not busy enough in iraq apparently ) , perhaps we could get involved in the cleanup instead ? 
  here in the uk we have a [ regressive tax system ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/e66ccafc8ad53d6a1a082d11f61a8b87.png ) . 
  this chart makes me think it must be even worse in other countries though . 
  are there any countries in europe with actual progressive taxes when looked at in aggregate ? 
  in the uk we have a massive tax free minimum ( ~ # 10000 per year soon to be increased to # 13k ) & poor people still pay massive taxes . 
  do n't underestimate how much poor people are taxed just for consumption . 
  in the uk someone in the bottom quintile ( lowest 20 % of earners ) is taxed 28 % on their income just via indirect taxes & we have zero rate vat on basic goods that i do n't believe poland has . 
  you can see here how the tax distribution is for the [ bottom 10 % ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/fde654adb97d3155e554ce117d4c7c2d.png ) & [ top 10 % ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/1b79e2cebdc53f0bb53090482f797b6c.png ) of earners for instance . 
  this results in a [ regressive tax distribution . 
  ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/f47fc4c7eceac9fda73a55a607bb83d6.png ) the current conservative government increased the tax free allowance ( from # 5k to # 10-13k ) at a cost to the treasury of # 12-13 billion pounds per year . 
  this was labelled as a way to help low income earners . 
  at the same time they cut # 12 billion from the welfare budget which primarily goes into helping low earners & increased vat by 5 % . 
  this has meant the net result is most low earners are far worse off than they were before .
