  the devil is in the detail as they say , unless you have some sort of cap on the tax free threshold it 's generally not going to help low earners any better than simply pumping money into some sort of tax credit system would . 
  same in the uk . 
  that 's before , just the base cost in both countries . 
  i honestly do not understand why they do n't just devolve everything excluding defense & foreign policy to the scottish government . 
  give them complete control over taxes & they keep all their revenue ( minus some for defense ) , plus a little more if we 're in deficit or lose a little if in surplus . 
  the treasury needs to retain some control to make sure the uk budget is harmonised ( same deficit/surplus everywhere ) but aside from that they should have complete control . 
  you could [ literally fly to spain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqldffkvhh4 ) , get your hip replaced , live in madrid for 2 years , get your hip replaced again & fly back to the us all for less than the cost of a single hip replacement in the us . 
  look at the ons report i linked before , there 's a huge proportion of people that do n't drink now . 
  regional differences will definitely play a part though . 
  also age , in some age brackets it has n't changed at all or the amount of non drinkers has even reduced . 
  you joke , but it does seem to be changing a lot with my generation . 
  i think if they ever legalise drugs that will have an effect as well , perhaps not on the incidence of people consuming any alcohol but definitely on the amount they consume . 
  there are much more safe ways to get the kind of effects getting drunk creates , it 's why our drug policy is so nonsensical . 
  i do n't know the detailed position of the uk green party , but from the looks of it the scottish green party have proposed the same thing , which is just an extension of the [ land reform act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/land_reform_in_scotland ) . 
  read more about it [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.scottishgreens.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2014/01/fans-right-to-buy-green-submission.pdf ) but if i 'm honest this is n't really a policy i 'm all that interested in or know a great deal about . 
  if it 's merit based then surely they 're most likely to come from europe still . 
  our culture is actually changing a lot . 
  the booze culture is slowly disappearing as people become more health conscious , there are more muslims & people have less money to spend on alcohol . 
  for instance 1/3rd of adults in london say they do not drink at all . 
  27 % of young adults ( 16-24 ) say they do not drink at all in 2013 , this is an increase from ~ 19 % in 2005 . 
  [ see more here . 
  ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ghs/opinions-and-lifestyle-survey/adult-drinking-habits-in-great-britain--2013/stb-drinking-2013.html#tab-key-points-in-2013 - ) for me this is quite a positive change as i 've never really enjoyed this facet of our culture . 
  for instance going to coffee shops has become much more popular among young adults as oppose to going to pubs . 
  did you do a test recently ? 
  whether you pass or not is a crapshoot to a certain extent . 
  you can fail for the smallest of details . 
  if everyone had to retest every few years it would be an absolute nightmare . 
  but sure , retesting eyesight seems like a good idea , plus some sort of limited road test for the elderly . 
  - scrapping sats is n't a terrible idea , for example the country with one of the best education systems in europe is finland & they do n't even do any tests till 16 . 
  talk to a teacher , loading up your kids with continuous performance reviews is n't the best way to teach them . 
  - in principle i do n't see a problem with allowing the local community to take over the running of a football club . 
  i 'm sure the fans do n't like it when some foreigner comes in & uses it as their personal money laundering scheme . 
  - prison cost reductions are over 5 years as you said , currently prison costs are around # 3 billion , a # 0.5 billion cost reduction in 2015 would be a 17 % cost reduction . 
  does n't seem crazy to me . 
  - currently inheritance tax makes no sense , you can avoid it entirely with a small amount of estate planning . 
  that 's why they feel the need to bring in changes . 
  understand that they want to change our society to one that is based upon individual merit as much as possible & not who your parents are . 
  it 's not totally unusual either as for example in denmark gifts are taxed for instance , either as income or some kind of inheritance . 
  in the uk they are taxed as neither . 
  - your position on carbon footprint may differ . 
  the issue is with the way we 're going there will be massive sea level rise , large swaths of the world will have no arable land any more & most of africa will turn into a dust bowl . 
  simply business as usual is n't going to work & someone has to start trying to change the system to avoid this catastrophe . 
  so your long term vision is n't to be in a world that does n't need nato ? 
  that does n't need national borders anymore ? 
  that we do n't live in a world with massive sea level rise & an african continent struggling to survive due to having no available arable land any more . 
  [ look at their 2015 manifesto ] ( https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/manifesto/green_party_2015_general_election_manifesto_searchable.pdf ) , you will find very few crazy ideas , at least from a liberal left wing perspective . 
  perhaps they will seem crazy from a conservative voter , but that 's not who they 're trying to appeal to . 
  i would actually say their manifesto policies make a lot more sense than the mainstream parties . 
  they want to change a lot , which may seem scary to some i suppose . 
  you should read [ their manifesto ] ( https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/manifesto/green_party_2015_general_election_manifesto_searchable.pdf ) because almost nothing on that article is actually in there & everything is costed at the end . 
  they actually went into the financials far more than any other manifesto did . 
  the confusion i think you & others come to is based upon their [ policy website ] ( https://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ ) . 
  that sets out their long term goals rather than what is practical in the short term . 
  * `` policies for a sustainable society ( pss ) are arranged in chapters of varying length covering different topic areas . 
  they represent the long term goals of the party and are available through the menu of links on the right of this page . 
  '' * it 's also created by their members so it does contain some wacky ideas that would never realistically see the light of day unless the world changed drastically . 
  as i said , read their manifesto , to me a lot of what they 're saying makes sense , more than any of the other party manifestos at least which are just more of the same . 
  * `` for each general and european election we produce a manifesto -- this sets out our immediate priorities and policy goals that green representatives would pursue for the term of that parliament . 
  each manifesto is based on our pss and is prepared through an agreed consultative process within the party . 
  '' * unless you see it in their manifesto that is not their policy under current circumstances . 
  this is just media blowing things out of proportion . 
  no one here actually cares . 
  the relationship is different though , i do n't see a future where we will ever not be allies no matter how bad the world gets . 
  our two countries are also more aligned on trade & foreign policy . 
  so while the veto argument is nonsense the influence ( not direct but due to our natural shared opinion on issues ) argument is not . 
  it 's just a regurgitated associate press article , every site has the same material . 
  are kurds within turkey also protesting ? 
  after all these are the people that have to live through the consequences , not people living in france ... 
  as i said , [ it was ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/9143b7202667cabe095a8a22d8636ce5.png ) a much [ larger part of our economy ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/0ac4f8f9d3ce127865dbf5146f937881.png ) than other major economies & we paid the price for that . 
  the financial crash had a rebalancing effect that we all had to pay for . 
  it 's not one or the other , the increases in income & wealth concentration on the continent were n't nearly as stark ( in many [ barely changing at all ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/0a8e23c3da63b1e27139929ce0958065.png ) ) . 
  it 's not as though these countries are especially poor due to them not changing their tax policies as heavily as we did , indeed many of these countries are a damn site more wealthy than we are !, 
  it 's not a good thing that our economy is so reliant on financial services . 
  it 's a way bigger part of our economy than any other major country . 
  this meant we were hit much much harder in 2009 . 
  this is what i mean when i say she started the mess , that 's when our economy started to change so much towards financial services . 
  the labour government in 1997 saw it as a cash cow with no end in site & that failed pretty spectacularly . 
  she started the mess , which is what i said , not that changes she made directly caused it . 
  it 's just unthinking pro eu readers . 
  the trend often reverses when you point out this nonsense & people feel they should correct it by upvoting . 
  it may be non ez federalists too i suppose , not wanting to see less integration within the eu . 
  basically the problem is people using the downvote button as a disagree button :p, 
  note i said she [ started the process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_bang_ ( financial_markets \\ ) ) not that she caused the crash . 
  successive governments made the problem worse . 
  she also heavily reduced the headline income tax , a progressive tax , while massively increasing sales taxes & fuel duty both regressive taxes . 
  she also tried to introduce the precursor to council tax ( later introduced by another conservative government under major ) , \u00e1 la the poll tax , another regressive tax . 
  she reversed a [ trend that until the 80s ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/f70cd27ce137ba2ce35ca9fc1a642a33.png ) , as i 'm sure you well know , was progressively making our income less concentrated at the top . 
  this seems like a very sensible approach tbh . 
  different budget . 
  perhaps the eu budget should be reduced though & funding moved over to the ez level . 
  the downvote are n't from british they 're from federalists that heavily populate this forum & decide to down vote anyone calling for less eu . 
  that 's all fine & dandy but eu countries foreign policies are very different . 
  until there is some united voice there without requiring permission from all eu governments it 's hard to cooperate . 
  any foreign policy decisions have to be broadly inline with the focus of all member states currently . 
  agreed . 
  seriously fuck thatcher . 
  that women started the deregulation and changes in tax policy that led to the 2009 crisis and the fact we 're the most unequal country in western europe . 
  her policies laid the building blocks for our massive housing and welfare problems too . 
  i could n't say anything at all nice about the women if i 'm honest .
