  haha that 's a fantastic photo , thanks for sharing . 
  [ stop the iraq war protests in 2003 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/soopppg.jpg ) . 
  around a million people turned up to [ protest in london ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/february_15,_2003_anti-war_protest ) . 
  one of the largest protest marches in uk history & that fucker tony still went ahead . 
  just goes to show how weak our democracy really is that so many people can be so against something & those in charge just ignore them . 
  i remember there were [ people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brian_haw ) camping outside parliament for almost a decade in protest against the action in iraq & afghanistan . 
  to think tony had the gall to stand up the other day & suggest the reason people were n't voting labour last election was because ed pushed the party too far to the left . 
  no tony the reason people wo n't vote for your party is because your policies took us into two destructive wars that damaged our credibility worldwide , killed or wounded millions of people & plunged us into the worst postwar recession this country has ever seen . 
  edit : i just realised this was only suppose to be up until 2000 , apologies !, 
  here are some more pre 2000 photos : [ london smog crisis in 1952 that killed around 12,000 people ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hb1cqga.jpg ) [ poll tax riots 1990 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z86ry7z.jpg ) [ miners general strike 1984-5 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6lsm1of.jpg ) suffice to say thatcher 's time in office was quite a divisive time in british politics . 
  never was it more clear the divide present between north & south . 
  definitely agree with this . 
  throughout the bush presidency for instance this was the case . 
  i ca n't see this relationship ever going , we 're just too similar . 
  likewise with europe i feel the same way ( more so western europe though i must admit ) , both regions i am fond of . 
  one thing i would say . 
  many english people have this idea that our government always needs to follow america , that we are their lapdog . 
  the stereotype at least in modern times came about from tony blair & our involvement in iraq & afghanistan . 
  i do n't agree with this unequal relationship & i do n't want to see us following them into any more wars . 
  i think we need to do our own thing & cooperate if it 's mutually beneficial . 
  you have bendy buses in brussels ? 
  they 're a bigger hazard to cyclists than those lanes . 
  in london we managed to get rid of those road hazards . 
  he made the newsroom if you have n't watched it . 
  you think they speak english when with their countrymen ? 
  * that * , is the right way to do consent laws . 
  you must be used to saying that by now . 
  such a classic show , one of my favourites . 
  yea the uk one has a lot of great english ( bbc/itv ) shows . 
  some of the european countries have a few good shows we do n't though , hannibal for example . 
  i use [ this to search for shows . 
  nothing i 've said is incorrect . 
  the conservatives stand for bad public services , low taxes for everyone including the lower/middle/upper classes , low welfare for everyone that is n't old , a more unequal society , worse workers rights , lower wages & more friendly business practices . 
  if you vote for them this is what you 're inevitably going to get . 
  the process is slow but that is what they stand for . 
  labour ( under an actual left wing leader ) stand for higher taxes on the upper classes , the same or lower taxes on the middle & lower classes . 
  they stand for good public services & workers rights but more restrictive business practices & taxes . 
  they stand for good welfare for all , lower middle & upper classes & a higher minimum wage . 
  they stand for a more equal society where the income & wealth is better spread . 
  to me the latter seems like the better option for the working man . 
  but perhaps i 'm wrong & they see all those things as terrible socialist proposals ? 
  i mean own your ideology at least , do n't try to fool people into thinking you 're a one nation government with a [ budget that looks like this . 
  most despicable things normal people do . 
  i do n't think he 's including serial killers in his reasoning ... 
  worse catalogue & not available in all countries . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  the way i see it is this . 
  after the war a lot of socialist policies got enacted & taxes massively increased to redistribute income . 
  we got the nhs , welfare state ( pensions , unemployment allowance , disability ) , nationalised industries & land assets , plus later employment protections for workers & union laws . 
  over the last 30-40 years successive conservative governments have slowly dismantled these things every time they 're in office . 
  industries are sold off to reduce the national debt & make them more ` efficient ' & ` profitable ' although it often inevitably ends up costing us more in the long run . 
  formerly high taxes are cut & wealth/income disparity starts to get worse . 
  then left wing governments are elected , and while they do n't tend to make the problem worse they do n't correct changes made in the past . 
  industries stay private , land stays sold , taxes stay low . 
  this slow creep is happening all over europe but the starting point is different . 
  france is a lot more socialist than britain , and nordic countries too . 
  so this transformation takes longer but it 's still happening . 
  what i do n't understand is why we keep electing these people . 
  when you look at who is the most well off , who has the best work / life balance , the best benefits , the best education , it is the nordic countries . 
  if you look at who has the worst it 's america . 
  yet we all seem to want to be more like them , why ? 
  the average person does n't benefit from these policies so why do they vote for them ? 
  it is bizarre , people are voting completely against their own interests . 
  i suppose you are not looking forward to 2017 ? 
  it looks as though you are pretty much guaranteed a ump politician becoming president . 
  how do you think the parliamentary elections will go ? 
  incognito mode for chrome as well as the other suggestions, 
  do you suffer from this in france too ? 
  how about anyone from nordic countries can comment on this , is your politics becoming more right leaning ? 
  left wing parties seem to be blowing up in s. europe at the moment . 
  that does n't really work when you have a housing policy that wants to preserve the green belt though . 
  if the south was allowed to grow naturally it would end up like tokyo . 
  nimbys & environmentalists would n't like that though . 
  i did n't mean industry in that sense though , perhaps it was the wrong word to use . 
  i mean different markets & jobs , with finance being in london that attracts more banks & insurance brokers , which attracts lawyers , which attracts accountants , etc. 
  wealth tends to attract wealth . 
  london also gets a tonne of investment from outside the uk , which other regions do not get . 
  it also makes it easier to outsource production to india , as import tariffs are reduced . 
  this would mean lost jobs here in europe . 
  we have the same in the uk except the opposite . 
  i presume the wealth is probably in the north , and once you have wealth it 's easier to accumulate more & grow industry . 
  unless there is a concerted effort to rebalance the country via fiscal transfers & investment it will never change . 
  in the uk governments in recent years have said they want to change this . 
  it 's not productive for a country to have everything so centralised , it 's better if wealth is more evenly distributed . 
  [ they have n't been succeeding however ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/c891b871eb37d8cc1c62c4b7723e2d5a.png ) , growth is still very much centered in london & the south . 
  it 's definitely not an easy thing to change , especially when the difference is so ridiculous ( inner london # 136,000 per head gva , inner newcastle # 21,000 per head ) . 
  [ uk gov have a nice interactive page for gva by region in the uk if anyone is interested . 
  ] ( http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/htmldocs/dvc220/index.html ), 
  do they actually work long hours ? 
  i remember looking into this a while ago & the conclusion i came to was that they actually do n't work hours longer than europe , they just have much less holiday time . 
  this means their yearly figures are higher . 
  the difference is quite stark , americans take on avg 16 paid holidays on avg compared to 35 in austria & portugal , 34 in spain , 31 in italy & france . 
  the minimum in the eu is 20 days ( wtd ) but almost all countries have more than that . 
  you think we care about the claims of argentina & chile ?!?!? 
  [ we also lose in terms of coastal territory ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/d3160573d9c02a2855276572b2b23d73.png ) ( and thus territorial waters ) . 
  we do beat denmark in that regard though . 
  netherlands is no harder to say than holland ? 
  [ why would you call the scottish/welsh etc english ?!?!?!, 
  hmm , the portuguese would like a word with you . 
  [ for reference .
