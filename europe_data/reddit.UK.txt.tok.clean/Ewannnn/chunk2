  in the uk , wages are actually lower than they were in 2000 adjusting for inflation ( using [ this data ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/2014-provisional-results/stb-ashe-statistical-bulletin-2014.html#tab-distribution-of-earnings ) with [ this ] ( http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/pages/resources/inflationtools/calculator/flash/default.aspx ) ) . 
  so , yes , people actually are worse off . 
  the cost of rent is increasing above inflation too , it 's so high now that many renters in london are now paying 70 % or more of their income per month in rent . 
  he said tory austerity is class war , and it is . 
  as in the example he gave , they are giving tax cuts to millionaires while cutting welfare . 
  they could increase taxes on the wealthy and leave welfare where it was but that 's not what they 're doing . 
  the people punished the most by austerity [ are the poorest ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/e4971a5446d7e6f1b0f3d909b009c7fd.png ) , that is not right & amp ; that is exactly as yannis described it . 
  the amount of people drinking & smoking here in the uk is reducing a lot among young people , [ many do n't drink at all any more . 
  ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ghs/opinions-and-lifestyle-survey/adult-drinking-habits-in-great-britain--2013/stb-drinking-2013.html# ), 
  just the austerity agenda in europe at the moment , forcing even left wing governments to sell off state assets . 
  with the right & left selling everything it wo n't be long before there 's nothing left . 
  that was my point , that not all uk media are like the guardian , ie left wing , most uk media are right wing . 
  well put it this way , look in any thread about republicans , all the top comments are ridiculing the candidates . 
  bernie sanders gets upvoted to the front page almost daily . 
  have you ever seen an american on here suggest the rich are paying too little tax ? 
  how is ttip/tpp perceived ? 
  badly . 
  have you ever seen an american suggest the minimum wage is too high ? 
  reddit is n't right wing . 
  perhaps this sub is , but reddit on the whole is most definitely not . 
  centre left parties tend to want to make taxes more progressive , this means the more you earn the more you lose . 
  this hurts older voters more than younger voters . 
  the young are more likely to be unemployed as you point out , they are more likely to be on lower wages , therefore they are more likely to rely on welfare & social protections championed by centre left parties . 
  young people are more accepting of change , and so are n't afraid of voting for more radical parties , especially those offering social change - vive la revolution as they say . 
  edit : another example , [ look at the elections in greece ] ( http://www.publicissue.gr/en/1689/greek-elections-6-2012-voter-demographics/ ) , syriza support is way higher among younger demographics while nd has support among older voters . 
  the bbc is centrist , their articles & broadcasting is usually pretty fair . 
  i would n't classify them as left or right wing , i would n't classify any broadcasters in that way . 
  they have to be more fair with their editorial than print or online media . 
  here are the [ voting demographics in the uk . 
  ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/how-britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide ) you will find conservative voters are older on average than labour voters . 
  i would be very doubtful that ump/lr are more popular among younger voters than older voters , but i ca n't find any polling data on it . 
  it makes sense that the young are more left leaning of course , they have little to lose from higher taxes , and everything to gain from more social & welfare policies . 
  media in the uk is incredibly right wing , as is public discourse . 
  do n't take online discourse to be representative of the general population , or the guardian/bbc to be representative of uk media . 
  this is what i like to call `` the old person factor '' . 
  old people are more conservative , our populations are aging , therefore we are becoming more conservative nations . 
  agreed , more integration with the eu economically & politically perhaps , but nato membership should not happen . 
  had it happened sooner russia would have invaded sooner . 
  entertaining the idea of ukraine in nato was a silly idea & should have been agreed would never happen . 
  do you want more ukrainians to die ? 
  because that 's how you get more ukrainians to die . 
  russia can always trump the west in ukraine , if we escalate they can escalate further & that 's not a war we 're going to win . 
  yes & if there are ever any large constitutional changes in the future ( like the lisbon treaty ) we can just have another referendum on it . 
  as i said we 're voting for the status quo not where the eu may be in 10 years . 
  mmmm yes & no . 
  the uk government likes to maintain control & influence while retaining sovereignty . 
  if the eu ever does become a federation that would be bad for the uk as we would become a minor partner . 
  there was a lot of talk recently for instance on the idea of an eu army , and how if europe manages to go ahead with the idea it would be a massive failure on the part of cameron for not stopping it . 
  most british are n't for the euro or i believe ever closer union , but we are n't signing up for either of those by staying in the eu . 
  any new treaties & we can just leave ( or , well , block the treaty !, 
  ) , we 're voting on the eu as it is at the moment , not what it may become . 
  you can see where the british currently lie on the issue [ here . 
  ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/09/22/eu-referendum-state-public-opinion/ ), 
  most people are for staying , it 's only really the older generation that want to leave . 
  do always agree with decisions your government makes ? 
  i myself agree with almost none of the ones mine make . 
  that 's just how representative democracy works , you rarely get exactly what you want . 
  you 're more rich than jordan & they somehow seem to cope with a million refugees . 
  i 'm sure you 'll cope with a few thousand . 
  i guess they 're only allies when you want something , because fuck greece / italy amiright ? 
  but they 're not more numerous , they just make more noise . 
  frontex budget still seems too small to be honest . 
  it should be in the billions of euros range i would think instead of hundreds of millions . 
  this is a good summary , especially on foreign policy although i wish we took a more german approach !, 
  it 's not a centrist view , that does n't mean it 's not worthy of discussion . 
  believe it or not but shooting refugees with rubber bullets & water cannons is n't a centrist view either yet that is discussed in countless threads . 
  just because someone has a more left wing view , and does n't want to close all the borders , does n't mean they need to seek professional help . 
  that just tells me you 're not interested in discussing this issue with people that have alternative views . 
  well you were till recently , but a lot of the tax loopholes are being cleaned up now i think . 
  at the end of the day my opinion on it is taxes need to be paid where the profit is made . 
  smaller countries should n't get to help multinationals avoid paying their fair share of taxes . 
  because his opinion does n't agree with yours ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with his points & people keep telling me they want to discuss immigration . 
  here , perfect opportunity to do so !, 
  yes !, 
  our government could do way more than they are to fix this issue . 
  2.7 % wage growth is pretty good , especially with inflation at rock bottom . 
  lol @ the downvotes in this thread . 
  but everyone keeps telling me the right wingers are being silenced !, 
  everyone is out to censor them !, 
  but i thought people wanted to discuss immigration ? 
  not silence alternative voices . 
  the hypocrisy is astounding . 
  bring on the downvotes , prove my point for me . 
  an over abundance of extreme right wingers is a huge problem , especially when they 're way more active than the average user & their abundance is only increasing ( at a faster rate than the average user ) . 
  why ? 
  what difference does it make when we have an opt out ? 
  he wo n't , he 's already said as such . 
  if cameron weakens workers rights it will be a 2020 election pledge to opt us back in . 
  i do n't know why the large eu countries are n't pressuring the smaller countries over this ( uk , germany , france , italy , spain ) . 
  they 're essentially taking tax money from these large countries and transporting it to the smaller ones . 
  all these tax havens within the eu need to go . 
  they need to close the ridiculous patent box schemes as well that many of the large countries have . 
  itt people arguing about immigration on a topic that has nothing to do with immigration . 
  - article is 3 weeks old - article is behind paywall - the stats are freely available on eurostat , anyone reading this forum has probably seen them 100 times by now very informative post op , cheers . 
  much discussion to be had . 
  all migrants are rapists , you heard it here first on / r/europe . 
  indeed , this title is especially ridiculous as well . 
  ah ok , fair enough , that seems sensible . 
  not really related to the `` refugee problem '' though .
