  why would they lose money ? 
  are interest rates on esm bonds lower than the interest on the loans the esm gives to eurozone states ? 
  [ read through this website & read between the lines . 
  ] ( http://www.futuretimeline.net/index.htm#timeline ) the kind of tech we will see in the next 100 years or so will make borders pretty pointless . 
  unless you agree with the scarcity premise ( peak oil etc , discussed on there ) then we may see the opposite happen , but i 'm more of an optimist . 
  even then in the long term i do n't see how nation states survive this kind of technology ( machines doing all work , unlimited renewable energy , full immersion vr etc ) . 
  default on any debt can cause cross default on all the debt greece owes to its creditors due to the way it was issued . 
  in 200 years i do n't think we 'll have borders ( due to technological advancement making them pointless ) that 's why i say it wo n't matter any more . 
  esm money is financed by issuing bonds iirc . 
  the money greece would receive would n't come directly from the eurozone states but from private investors . 
  the eurozone states only lose money if greece does n't pay back the money & then the guarantor has to pay it back to bondholders ( i.e. 
  the other eurozone states ) . 
  this is why the money is n't really the issue , they could give greece 200 billion euros tomorrow it would n't cost them anything . 
  they 're just worried greece wo n't pay it back at which point they 're liable . 
   fiscal union ha . 
  hahaha . 
  you think france will sign up for fiscal union ? 
  you 're avin a laugh mate . 
  this is the kind of blind idealism others talk about . 
  no way in hell countries will give up fiscal autonomy , their stance on expenditure & taxation are completely different . 
  sure , in a few hundreds years it wo n't matter any more though . 
  hell it does n't really matter now . 
  people on here just fetishize being the ` strongest ' , the country with the biggest economy , the biggest military . 
  it 's just grandiose ideas of empire . 
  as if people in the smaller western states are any less happy than those in the larger ones . 
  as if becoming some super state will make everyone better off . 
  waiting for final proposals , i 'm not interested enough in the topic to start getting annoyed about * potential * changes ( i.e. 
  leaked documents generally leaked to cause faux outrage ) . 
  the ratification process takes much longer in the eu than the us , there will be ages to see the final text . 
  i was n't referring to corporation tax , that arguably should be lower , but rather taxes on individuals receiving the money . 
  many libertarians for instance would be dead set against ttip because they see it as corporate cronyism , but they 'd also be dead set against any tax increases to counter the inherent imbalances in our system . 
  it 's like comcast bullshit and / r/technology , i had to unsub from a lot of places because 1/3rd of the front page was filled with comcast complaint articles . 
  you see this is the issue i have . 
  many seem to be against this thing because they think it will allow rich people to get richer , & amp ; corporations to make more money . 
  what i do n't understand is these same people are often against higher taxes . 
  surely we should make it as easy as possible for these guys to make money then redistribute it to the rest of us via higher taxes and redistributive welfare ? 
  purely rejecting such plans to ` stick it to the man ' seems rather silly to me . 
  the imf projects spending will [ fall to 36.6 % by 2018 ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=78&amp;pr.y=5&amp;sy=2013&amp;ey=2020&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=112&amp;s=ggx_ngdp&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) , with the added cuts in the recently released budget [ another 1.6 % ] ( http://www.kent.ac.uk/news/society/6226/budget-will-bring-public-spending-down-to-below-us-levels-research-shows ) will be cut taking us to 35 % which is just below [ us government projections ( imf ) . 
  ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=69&amp;pr.y=10&amp;sy=2013&amp;ey=2020&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=111&amp;s=ggx_ngdp&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) of course projections might be wrong but spending will be close anyway . 
  they would n't act punitively towards the uk , they rely far too much on uk imports/exports . 
  any sort of punitive measures would push the eurozone into recession as well as the uk . 
  it would also cause some states to leave ( ireland for instance ) & maybe even lead to disintegration entirely . 
  government spending is generally a pretty good way to redistribute wealth . 
  when you cut taxes you cut that redistribution , especially if the tax cuts are mostly for the wealthy . 
  on the other hand the american government way of redistribution is kinda crappy , they spend far too little on welfare for the poor & far too much on welfare for the rich . 
  to put it into perspective in the uk state spending will fall to below us levels by the end of the parliament . 
  but we have housing benefit , state healthcare , unemployment benefit , disability benefit , state pension for everyone etc. 
  these welfare programmes are very redistributive & help combat inequality . 
  their consumption is much [ higher in comparison ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/65e1b33545e97e4ee73a97b5281bb063.png ) to the amount they earn which is why [ their rate is much higher ] ( http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/unfair_and_unclear.pdf ) . 
  you 'd think that from the rhetoric from the tabloids but no , most immigration is from outside the eu . 
  within the eu most immigration is from the eu15 states then just over half as many from eu8 followed by a fair amount from eu2 . 
  most visas granted are to people from asia . 
  [ see here ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/may-2015/stb-msqr-may-2015.html#tab-2--immigration-to-the-uk ), 
  this right here is what will destroy our economy , senseless punitive immigration policies . 
  thank god we 're in the eu & ca n't close our borders , it would be an unmitigated disaster . 
  what ? 
  our demographic problem comes from a [ massive baby boom after ww2 ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/interactive/uk-population-pyramid---dvc1/index.html ) followed by a steep fall in fertility rates . 
  you do n't have to continuously import more & more people to solve the problem , only enough to keep the young demographic the same size . 
  what you do n't want is a triangle shaped pop . 
  pyramid becoming diamond shaped due to falls in immigration or native population fertility . 
  that depends how old you are . 
  i 'm 26 , i doubt i 'll ever get a state pension . 
  the national insurance system is due to go bankrupt in the 2020s without changes to the tax rates or retirement age . 
  this system whereby working age people should pay the benefits of those that are retired is eventually going to have to end because as you say it 's not sustainable at all . 
  personally i 'd like to see pensions become means tested & wrapped up into the standard benefits system . 
  national insurance is removed & absorbed into income taxes . 
  working age benefits & private pensions are more than sustainable however . 
  this is not a right wing position necessarily . 
  he 's actually right , at least in terms of my country . 
  a left wing proposal would be to kerb benefits to higher earners , this would make the system sustainable . 
  at the moment we give state pensions to a lot of people that realistically should not be receiving it & this imbalances the system . 
  this has meant we 've needed to slowly increase tax rates over time to pay for it , but this can not go on forever . 
  why does the eu require these measures ? 
  sales taxes are so regressive , i always say they 're way way too high here even with the 0 % rate on basic goods . 
  is it just due to the budgetary link ? 
  could they not change this ? 
  vat rates here , as well as other regressive taxes put us in a bizarre situation where lower income people end up paying higher tax rates than middle & high income earners . 
  i think it really depends , if greece starts to see growth then they 'll continue paying the funds . 
  if they do n't see growth & unemployment does n't fall , then maybe we 'll be back here in a few years or less . 
  indeed , this really is an internet only phenomenon . 
  likely because so many users here are american . 
  probably depends who & where someone was shot . 
  definitely would n't be news if it came from a black or hispanic neighbourhood . 
  hmm interesting , yes this makes more sense . 
  as i said trying to compete with turkey seems kinda crazy , their military spending & capability ca n't really hope to be matched by such a small country as greece . 
  then again i suppose it would depend upon what they cut anyway , if cuts to the budget result in job losses that could be bad too . 
  yes , that 's totally what i 'm saying . 
  this is n't an american issue , the imf should n't have even been involved to begin with the eurozone should have dealt with the matter internally . 
  quite . 
  i 'm surprised this article is still doing the rounds , it was on / r/uk days ago . 
  pointless drivel written to rile up people about those on benefits & immigrants . 
  thanks for sharing op . 
  i do n't really see why they 're pushing back on military . 
  why is it so important for greeks to spend so much on military ? 
  obviously they still have issues with turkey but i 'm not sure trying to compete with them is the best idea ... what 's the opinion of ordinary greeks on this matter ? 
  if they receive an esm loan that allows them to pay their debt obligations for the next 3 years it will allow them to survive past the short term problems . 
  my thoughts are that they will just get more loans with better terms to pay off the loans they 've already received . 
  it all seems kinda ridiculous but there you go . 
  they may get some structural & humanitarian funds too i suppose . 
  has n't merkel already ruled out debt relief ?
