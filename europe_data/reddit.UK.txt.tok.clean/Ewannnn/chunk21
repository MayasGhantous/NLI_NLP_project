  at best they will just get more favourable loans to pay for their loans i think ? 
  even that is pushing it . 
  if they 're accepting the previous offer ( or even slightly worse ) but not getting debt relief either , what was the whole point to this charade the last 6 months ? 
  tsipras has been playing fast & loose with people 's livelihoods for nothing . 
  edit2 : [ june 26th proposals here ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/attachment/ip-15-5270/en/list%20of%20prior%20actions%20-%20version%20of%2026%20june%2020%2000.pdf ) if you want to compare [ full greek proposals here ] ( http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/userfiles/c8827c35-4399-4fbb-8ea6-aebdc768f4f7/9292390.pdf ) , they 're looking for an esm loan in return for the changes . 
  edit3 : guardian summary : '' * so to recap , greece has put forward a plan of reforms , spending cuts and tax rises that is close to what was demanded by its creditors before alexis tsipras called last sunday 's referendum . 
  * * the plan includes sweeping changes to vat to raise a full 1 percent of gdp , moving more items to the 23 % top rate of tax , including restaurants - a key battleground before . 
  * * greece has also dropped its opposition to abolishing the lower vat rate on its islands , starting with the most popular tourist attractions , despite firm opposition from tsipras 's coalition partner . 
  * * athens also appears to have made significant concessions on pensions , agreeing to phase out solidarity payments for the poorest pensioners by december 2019 , a year earlier than planned . 
  it would also raise the retirement age to 67 by 2022 . 
  * * and it has agreed to only raise corporation tax to 28 % , as the imf wanted , not 29 % as previously targeted . 
  * * greece is also proposing to cut military spending by $ 100m in 2015 and by $ 200m in 2016 , and implement changes to reform and improve tax collection and fight tax evasion . 
  it will also press on with privatisation of state assets including regional airports and ports ; some government mps had vowed to reverse this . 
  * * in return , greece appears to be seeking a three-year loan deal worth $ 53.5 bn . 
  * * two obvious questions -- will this still be enough for creditors , or will they push for even tougher `` conditionality '' now we 're talking about a new bailout programme . 
  and how will alexis tsipras persuade his party , including the hardline radical left , to support it ? 
  * '' edit : paul mason at c4 [ had this ] ( https://twitter.com/duncanweldon/status/619266086157066240 ) to say : `` snap analysis of greek proposal : ( 1/5 ) breaks taboo of raising tax on islands , starting with big ones ( e.g. 
  ( 2/5 ) : earlier removal of pension supplement ; very tough move to age 67 retirement pension - and more privatisations . 
  ( 3/5 ) the $ 13n figure is simply cumulative result over more years - however privatisations may bring tangible extra money to table ( 4/5 ) syriza mps meet at 8am local , parliament at 1400 local . 
  everybody saying `` betrayal '' should have read earlier drafts ; its incremental ( 5/5 ) if no debt relief and no structural funds this will tank greek economy for 3 years . 
  ergo ... over to the lenders . '', 
  it is also that women care for children & the elderly . 
  if you 're caring for a 70 y/o or young child you 're hardly going to be able to travel the thousands of miles to reach europe are you ? 
  the journey is not physically possible for some people , so they must stay where they are no matter the risks involved . 
  the cynic in me tells me this is all calculated to allow debt forgiveness without debt forgiveness . 
  instead of forgiving debt they say accept these demands & we 'll give you ` humanitarian aid ' . 
  we 'll also give you money from the eu budget for ` investment ' . 
  it 's all about selling it to their electorates . 
  whenever i see cup measurements i check the nationality of the person making the recipe . 
  then i check google for the amount it 's suppose to be in grams . 
  seriously , fuck bullshit cup & spoon measurements , they 're so silly . 
  we use metric in the uk mostly ( well unless you 're * old * , but who cares about them ) . 
  american cooking measurements are the worst , especially with all their damn cups instead of grams !, 
  well i suppose being french you do have the most experience as far as public sector strikes go !, 
  just thought i 'd post this as a light hearted change to all the doom & gloom greece threads . 
  currently there 's a tube strike going on in london which means everyone has to use the buses . 
  this has resulted in very polite , quintessentially british queuing . 
  this means france must be doing really well ? 
  one of the highest productivity in the eu ( 6th ) & one of the largest cap beneficiaries ( so [ large ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:production_of_cereals,_2013.png ) agriculture sector ) . 
  in my experience , germans are really good people to raid with . 
  greeks are pretty much the worst , but then i did n't raid with many so my experience is limited . 
  actually all the greek people i 've raided with really pissed me off , they were kinda useless . 
  not to say they 're all like this but just my experience . 
  perhaps i take these things too seriously ... 
  wow . 
  look at those party support swings . 
  i did n't think there would be as large a difference between labour & conservative . 
  i knew it would swing more positive for labour but that 's a big difference . 
  ukip supporters seem kinda delusional on this question : `` which of the following statements about british muslims comes closest to your own view ? 
  they had to bail out their banks to the tune of 45 billion euros . 
  that 's a lot for a country that in 2015 has a budget of 70 billion euros ... 
  i believe iceland suffered similar problems which is why bailing out their banking institutions just was n't feasible . 
  you know what this is telling me ? 
  we need a truck load of oil like norway !, 
  daym !, 
  we should [ be like china ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p5rmlht.png ) & claim the entire north sea oil as our own !, 
  the problem is , if you give greece more money & they promise reforms but do n't do anything ( or * do n't do enough * ) , they 'll be back asking for more money again . 
  this is partly why they 're in this mess , because they did n't change their practices fast enough after the financial crash in 09 . 
  what the eu wants to see is reforms that will make greece solvent in the long term , and not just for the next year or two . 
  if greece are n't willing to make these changes then whatever money you give them is just disappearing into a black hole never to be seen again . 
  so basically a load of tax havens that are stealing large amounts of the world 's wealth . 
  well , i ca n't read the article for obvious reasons but lukoil is a russian company . 
  most people here would n't want billions going back to that country . 
  hey i got an a in most of my last minute projects !, 
  this is the same way i feel about pensions for those that do n't really need it ( i think it should be means tested & the ni rate cut ) . 
  people living on the state pension now paid a lower rate for it than i do & i 'm the one paying their pension * now . 
  * this is fundamentally unfair . 
  if you 're alive during a period where the population pyramid looks like a triangle you 're going to get a fantastic pension , if the pyramid becomes an upside down pyramid say goodbye to it . 
  the problem is the voting age though i guess plus this must not be a major issue for parents . 
  benefits for students is an easy thing to cut when they do n't vote & they 're a much smaller demographic anyway . 
  [ check the spectator ( conservative tabloid for those that do n't know ) comments haha !, 
  ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/07/five-policies-that-george-osborne-has-just-stolen-from-ed-miliband/ ) `` more leftist nonsense from the tories . 
  now positioned well to the left of the labour party . 
  more tax and spend . 
  more ducking what needs doing . 
  more debt . 
  terrific . '', 
  for reference , this budget will take public spending to the lowest level since the 1960s , when healthcare & pension spending among other things were much lower . 
  it will be around the same as the us government or slightly lower . 
  indeed , i 'm not sure how anyone can say gmos are n't heavily scrutinised here . 
  hardly any of them are being grown in the eu , mostly due to scaremongering and outright lying by lobbying groups to suggest they cause cancer & other harmful side effects . 
  different times my friend . 
  wow , i did not know this . 
  that is crazy to read about . 
  [ higher quality iplayer link for those with uk ip ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b062zs5w/panorama-greece-euro-or-bust ), 
  i do n't think there are any states that want to join together as a federation . 
  honestly i just think that 's some wishy washy opinion certain people have on here but not in the real world . 
  you just have to look at how the individual states are reacting to greece , the piig countries & migrant issues to see this . 
  people do not want further integration , we are all far too different . 
  if anything we 're already too integrated & the current troubles are making that evidently clear ( schengen migrant issues , debt issues single currency ) . 
  in the case of our politicians they believe in smaller government & austerity is the perfect ploy to forward that goal . 
  that 's why you 'll see them cutting the state as opposed to raising taxes . 
  heh i stand corrected , do you happen to know where this is sourced from ? 
  that difference between median & mean income is pretty shocking . 
  thanks for sharing op !, 
  not sure that 's true , the primary lender to greece is via [ efsf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_financial_stability_facility ) loans of which the rich states are larger contributor per capita . 
  by the looks of it the contributions are roughly equal between germany & slovenia for example ( ~ 150 % difference in per capita gdp & contribution ) . 
  [ they also barely contributed at all to the first bailout package . 
  ] ( http://www.rekenkamer.nl/english/publications/topics/eu_governance_to_combat_the_economic_and_financial_crisis/financial_stability_instruments/financial_instruments/greek_loan_facility ), 
  i do n't know about the others but ireland & spain 's debt in 2009 were n't that large ( % gdp lower than france , germany , uk for instance ) .
