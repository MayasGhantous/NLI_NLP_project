  ireland had a ridiculous budget deficit that year caused by their bank bailouts , to a whopping 32 % of gdp . 
  so of course their debt ballooned quickly . 
  not sure what he is on about as far as competitiveness is concerned , irish exports were n't hammered that hard & they had a current account surplus by 2011 . 
  if anything those two countries exports were helped by the crisis not hindered . 
  again spain showed a net positive current account balance in 2014 , something they had not had since the 1980s . 
  the finnish-russian border is the second largest . 
  the finnish-norway border is similar in size to the croatia-bosnia border . 
  after that it is the french-brazil border . 
  trust the american to come up with a solution that involves blowing shit up !, 
  those figures are from 2004 , we are spending twice that amount now as a percentage of gdp . 
  uk aid in 2013 was # 11.4 billion & # 11.7 billion in 2014 . 
  [ here is a more updated list of countries by developmental aid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_governments_by_development_aid ) . 
  eritrea is a cesspool & their government are persecuting their own citizens , do some research on the country . 
  most asylum seekers from that country are granted asylum here within the eu . 
  as far as illegal crossings & asylum claims are concerned morocco is not a country many people come from & neither is ethiopia . 
  [ see here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_quarterly_report ) for asylum claims , [ see here ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/publications/risk_analysis/annual_risk_analysis_2015.pdf ) for migrationary information ( appendix at the end has all statistics ) . 
  of course we get a steady flow of economic migrants but the massive movements are due to country specific factors , the journey is risky & people do n't take it unless they are very desperate . 
  with regards to why they 're all young men ? 
  i 've written about this in the past but to summarise the women generally care for the children & elderly so they can not travel ( yes even if it means staying inside a warzone ) . 
  the men will go abroad first & women will come later via more safe means . 
  yes we should take care of our homeless too , you wo n't get any disagreement from me there . 
  so they should donate more to the places they 're sending them & not indefinitely detain people in poor conditions . 
  the uk donates around four times as much in developmental aid than australia does . 
  i 'm not saying we need to accept them but if we 're going to send them somewhere let 's at least make sure conditions there are decent . 
  we certainly have the money to do so . 
  i already am sending money to the unemployed , both here & abroad via my taxes . 
  last year we spent # 12 billion on foreign aid , more than any other country bar america . 
  dude the mega thread is useless for discussing things . 
  everything not posted within the first few hours of the post is hidden due to reddit 's upvote system . 
  why not just let the threads be posted for today ? 
  it 's not like the front page was n't covered with greece threads every other day , why should today be any different ? 
  all megathreads do is make discussion impossible ... are we not going to even be allowed a new thread when the poll results are in ? 
  starting the problem ? 
  the problem is their countries are being destroyed , people do n't try to cross the med if they 're not desperate . 
  you can see this in the number of people crossing , for instance in 2011 1616 people from syria crossed illegally into europe . 
  the civil war started in late 2011 & by 2012 7900 people crossed here , then 25500 in 2013 , then isis appeared in 2014 & 79000 people crossed . 
  if we had stayed in libya after we bombed gaddafi we likely would n't be suffering from this issue as we would have somewhere to send them . 
  then again if we had n't bombed saddam we would n't even need somewhere to send them because isis would n't have appeared to begin with . 
  i think polls are forever tainted for me after our last election ... we went in expecting one thing & got something completely different . 
  it completely changed the discourse in the media , all that waffle about miliband being pm with the snp holding the purse strings turned out to be nonsense . 
  perhaps it even influenced the result who knows ? 
  then i think we 're at an impasse because i do n't see returning people back to where they may be killed or persecuted as an acceptable solution . 
  if you have somewhere safe to send them that is n't here i could get on board , but not sending them back to libya , syria , somalia et al. 
  it 's not a good solution to the problem , but it does move the problem away from your border . 
  it 's very much a `` not my problem jack '' approach to the situation . 
  which i think is pretty cruel considering how ridiculously rich we are in the west to be honest . 
  especially australia , they 're one of the richest countries on earth on a per capita basis . 
  since joining europe italy has contributed net 95 billion euros to the eu budget . 
  poland has received net 61 billion euros . 
  would you be ok with italy deciding they do n't want to contribute to the eu budget anymore & instead using that money to fund housing for the refugees ? 
  this is in response to the idea that poland does n't have a responsibility to help italy , as they were n't a colonial power etc. 
  even if they were n't they 've benefitted off the back of others in the eu . 
  but you 're saying italy should n't accept them either . 
  but this is ignoring the reality of the situation in that they have to accept them , just as poland would be if they claimed asylum there . 
  but let 's assume they do n't have to accept them , in which case where should they send them back to ? 
  back to their homeland to be persecuted / killed ? 
  agreed , this whole fiasco has been handled badly by both sides . 
  it 's leaving a definite sour taste in my mouth . 
  what 's your point ? 
  i said labour would n't have changed anything with regards to income distributions , it 's not a reason to cut the top rate of tax . 
  labour are just * marginally * better than the tories as far as compassion & helping low income earners is concerned . 
  furthermore miliband is n't gordon brown , their politics were rather different & he was n't suggesting any tax cuts for high earners . 
  quite the opposite . 
  how many were cancelling before tsipras walked out ? 
  how many cancellations do they usually get ? 
  just saying , the wording is quite politicized . 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3bwkt3/david_cameron_has_delivered_the_obituary_for/csr2a3r ) . 
  this policy costs the government a lot in lost revenue ( [ # 12-13 billion per year in 16/17 ] ( http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/researchbriefing/summary/sn06569 ) ) , money that could & is somewhat being used to help those on low incomes . 
  imagine for a moment , they left the personal allowance where it was in 2010 but distributed those # 12 billion to people , via tax credits , earning the minimum wage , how much better off they would be ? 
  around # 10000 better off is the answer ( # 12 billion / 1.2 million on minimum wage ) . 
  of course this is simplistic , not only those on minimum wage get tax credits , but you see my point i think . 
  well , no , actually , i wo n't retire till ~ 2060 . 
  it 's unlikely i will get any state pension at all , but i 'll still have to pay to those that do till then ... 
  i suppose on the bright side we will probably face technological unemployment long before 2060 . 
  i 'm one of the people that thinks this . 
  i do n't think labour would have changed growth going to the top 1 % though , that will take fundamental changes in tax law that labour were n't willing to commit to . 
  my problem with the conservatives is n't necessarily austerity , but it 's the way in which they do it . 
  they 're cutting massively over 2 years , which most commentators say is not needed & is basically a political tactic rather than sound economics . 
  this means they 'll end up with a surplus towards election time & they 'll be able to spend more & funnel more growth towards the end of their period in office . 
  we saw this last election , where they cut mercilessly , almost caused a new recession , then leaned back & claimed victory , even though their original plan was an economic disaster . 
  it 's also where they 're cutting . 
  they 're raising the tax threshold ( tax break to middle classes ) , they cut the top rate of tax last time ( tax break to those earning # 150k + ) , they raised vat ( tax on the poor ) , they 're raising the inheritance tax threshold ( to # 1m tax free ) . 
  all the while mercilessly cutting the welfare budget which not only affects the unemployed & disabled but the working poor too . 
  this is not a fair & equitable way to cut the government budget , not everyone is suffering evenly from this austerity . 
  pensioners for instance have not had any part of their budgets cut , the nhs has not been cut , education has not been cut , defense has barely been cut , foreign aid spending is out of control too . 
  to me this is bizarre as it is the working population that is the cornerstone of the economy . 
  pumping money into the less well off makes sense , they 'll spend it & grow the economy . 
  pumping money into the more affluent just means they 'll save & hoard the money for the future . 
  and people on here think we 're going to get further integration . 
  the eu states ca n't even agree on the smallest things . 
  our entire language was infiltrated by the pesky french when they invaded us in 1066 anyway !, 
  now it 's getting polluted by those yanks over the pond :(, 
  our eu referendum is n't till 2017 , i doubt this will have much/any effect on the outcome tbh . 
  [ we have the same problem in the uk ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/82f48ceb8f6f873caadc08a1fc8222f7.png ) . 
  pensioners get permanent raises to their pension while working age benefits are cut across the board even though they 're the ones paying pensioner benefits . 
  it 's kinda disgusting actually , we have to pay for these benefits [ through higher taxes ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/8d961d0aed6b809971fdc634057d8309.png ) that they never had to pay themselves . 
  for reference employee ni contributions have increased from just over 6 % in the 70s to the 12 % it is today & will continue to rise if the fund is to remain solvent . 
  [ i was just going by these figures for both countries . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/wages ) poverty figures for both uk & germany seem pretty similar , around 15 % being below the poverty line . 
  this is always going to be an issue when electorates successively elect conservatives to government as they have done in the uk & germany ( or even centre left parties like our labour party that support neoliberal policies ) .
