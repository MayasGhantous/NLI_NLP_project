  i 'm not sure it 's especially linked to germany 's export based economy . 
  rights in america are far worse & their economy is n't export based . 
  wages in germany are over 50 % higher than here though & working hours are much lower . 
  furthermore employment rights are better there & some [ enshrined in eu law ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=706&amp;langid=en&amp;intpageid=205 ) are n't popular with our government . 
  i do n't believe for one second if we left the eu employment rights would improve here rather they would deteriorate in the grand focus of being ` business friendly ' . 
  good post . 
  why do you think germany is shoving austerity down the throats of other eurozone economies though ? 
  surely stimulus from other economies would improve german exports by spurring demand/spending . 
  the revenue problem is in large part due to corruption & they have suggested a lot of changes to combat this . 
  they 've also suggested raising vat , which while regressive is at least a reliable form of taxation . 
  [ see the proposals here . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-5270_en.htm ), 
  we 're not , as i said that view is still a minority opinion here , just less of a minority compared to the western european states . 
  they owe us a few billion via the imf too but we 'll probably get that back eventually . 
  [ see here ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/05/13/the-new-sick-man-of-europe-the-european-union/ ) . 
  we 're actually one of the least positive as far as austerity is concerned although it is still a minority opinion . 
  debt write off is not politically feasible . 
  debt extension [ can be ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11372369/three-myths-about-greeces-enormous-debt-mountain.html ) analogous to [ debt cancellation ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11373293/things-could-get-ugly-if-greeces-never-never-actually-means-never.html ) though without the political fallout . 
  no doubt further extensions will take place after the referendum & a new deal is agreed upon . 
  i 'm not sure what the alternative was ? 
  greece has been vastly overspending for decades . 
  the budget was always going to have to be cut or revenue raised . 
  of course the massive surpluses ( 4.5 pc ) imposed by the troika are wrong , but to suggest no austerity was needed is naive i think . 
  i was missing my daily greece fix , thanks for bringing it back up ha !, 
  this whole victoria situation is based on conjecture at this point . 
  i think the blackouts are more about mod-admin communication though . 
  i 'm saying how can you convince people immigration is n't a huge issue & they should care for those on welfare when you have the media demonizing these people in the press . 
  i was responding to his first paragraph . 
  sun , the mail , the times , take your choice of any right wing paper . 
  they also do n't seem to understand the issue many in my country have with immigrants from poland & other eastern european states . 
  it 's not to do with integration it 's to do with jobs & in that respect polish immigrants are just as harmful as asylum seekers . 
  they 're being somewhat hypercritical imo . 
  the economic difference between poland & the uk is n't much different than between an african state & poland . 
  the lesson learned is that people everywhere have issues with economic migration full stop , whether within the eu or from outside it the issues are the same . 
  personally i do n't mind the situation we 're in , but i ca n't help but feel it 's damaging for eastern states in the long run as they suffer from the brain drain . 
  perhaps things will correct themselves though who knows ? 
  how ? 
  the media has been pushing this divide & rule strategy for ages . 
  the demonizing of those on welfare & immigrants has been going on for a decade or more now . 
  this is the problem with our two party system , it blocks out certain voices . 
  the conservatives do have a fair amount of liberal members within them , as do labour , but they get drowned out by the rest . 
  if we had a multi party system likely some of the labour mps would go to the greens & some conservatives to ukip ( who would rebrand , as they 're in the process of doing , into a right libertarian party ) . 
  the more socially conscious conservatives would join the liberals also . 
  as i said , they 've always been filthy rich . 
  they overtook sweden in 1997 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita #imf _ estimates_between_2000_and_2009, 
  just cloud over here in britain unfortunately . 
  i am still liking the warm weather though , contrary to many of the [ british people over in ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3bt889/fuck_me_its_still_fucking_hot/ ) / r/unitedkingdom . 
  some people are never happy it seems !, 
  so we 're not that shitty light orange any more , that 's a positive i suppose . 
  ca n't let those froggies be a different colour to us !, 
  we 'll overtake them soon anyway ... 
  the question is , do these figures include drugs & hookers ? 
  ireland has been filthy rich since the early 2000s , at least in terms of gdp . 
  i would n't really consider mathematicians scientists either to be honest , they 're their own category . 
  not that this matters for / u/camoes point . 
  how so ? 
  love it !, 
  cheers for sharing op , 
  we do have some localised problems with immigrants , at least in the uk although i 'd presume other countries do as well . 
  they tend to move to the same areas so you end up in the situation where entire school classes only have polish children for instance ( as is the case with a roman catholic primary school near me ) . 
  it 's this segregation which causes problems , america has massive issues in black & hispanic neighbourhoods for instance . 
  if we could assimilate better it would go a long way to combat racial issues . 
  as you said , when people mix they are less inclined to be irritated by immigration . 
  [ this is the problem ] ( http://imgur.com/nztegq6 ) , distribution is not evenly spread and if you look closer the contrast will be even more stark where in some parts uk nationals are a minority . 
  - rent in london is [ twice as large as in other parts of the country . 
  ] ( http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-2048680/rent-unaffordable-families-parts-england.html ) - are you going to be paid twice as much for working in london ? 
  a higher average does n't suggest double the size of salary it just suggests there are more well paid professionals in london . 
  would a doctor in london be paid twice the salary of say a doctor working in hull ? 
  i 'm not disputing the fact there are more well paid jobs in london , just that if you can get a similar job elsewhere you will be better off financially . 
  most people do n't care a rats ass about encryption , most people could n't tell you what the word even means in this context . 
  they 'd have no problem passing this if it was feasible , even many in labour support this kind of draconian bullshit . 
  not sure it would get past the lords though , even if their median age is 69 they do tend to look at things more carefully . 
  i take your point but why do areas with low house prices have low per capita gdp ( ppp ) . 
  presumably economic output in these places is much lower . 
  anyhow this is certainly not a good indication of prosperity . 
  most people are more prosperous outside london due to the ridiculous rents there ( doing the same job ) . 
  [ this seems to be the text of the article  ( http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/greek-default-no-new-bailout-unless-tsipras-goes/story-fnb64oi6-1227422961480?nk=0ca95ed1c7cd0f86f5630c67ce970c1d-1435718762 ) greece will not get a cent in new eurozone bailout loans while alexis tsipras and yanis varoufakis remain in power , because germany will block any such deal , one of europe 's most influential politicians has told the times . 
  `` today there is the question of do we trust tsipras and varoufakis ? 
  the answer is clear to all parties , no , '' the senior german conservative said . 
  he also lifted the lid on a european union attempt to push mr tsipras 's left-wing syriza out of power regardless of the outcome of the vote on july 5 . 
  if greece 's prime minister and finance minister remained in office , even after a `` yes '' vote in sunday 's referendum , then athens would stand no chance of a new bailout , he indicated . 
  under the rules of the european stability mechanism , the euro 's bailout fund , the german parliament , or bundestag , has a veto or blocking vote over any new program such as that requested by greece at the 11th hour . 
  the senior german conservative said that angela merkel 's ruling christian democrat union ( cdu ) and its bavarian allies the christian social union ( csu ) would block any request made while the pair , described as `` communists '' , remained in power . 
  `` in my party the cdu/csu there would be a lot of colleagues who would vote ` no ' if varoufakis and tsipras are asking . 
  for sure . 
  because there is simply no trust any more . 
  they say , i am not going to give taxpayers ' money to greece without a reliable partner , '' he said . 
  referring to syriza , he added : `` we need a reliable partner who wants to do the job . '' the eu 's plan is to back a `` yes '' vote strongly by posing it as an in/out question on membership of the euro rather than austerity measures and then , in the event of a victory , to oust syriza after the expected resignation of mr tsipras . 
  `` we will do everything to get a ` yes ' . 
  then we will need a new government , then we have to implement measures , '' he said . 
  the politician revealed that the socialist martin schulz , the president of the european parliament , was involved in secret talks , possibly including mr tsipras -- whom he sees as a moderate -- to `` split the syriza movement '' . 
  the aim was to create a `` technical government '' as a precondition for a new eu bailout , incorporating moderate mps in syriza to avoid new elections . 
  in the event of a `` no '' vote and syriza continuing to hold the reins of power , the german conservative said , `` it 's over '' and greece would have to leave the euro after defaulting on ecb loans on july 20 . 
  `` we will talk about a humanitarian rescue program but not an additional [ bailout ] , '' he said . 
  people have expected this to happen for weeks indeed , i remember reading an article about it in may . 
  the debt does n't just disappear , they will have to pay it back eventually ( presumably with some sort of haircut like in argentina although that 's up to the creditors ) . 
  the link does n't look at the level of taxation only the progressivity . 
  the ratio accounts for differing income inequality . 
  it does n't include sales taxes though which are a large part of taxation in many countries & are regressive . 
  really i think the author is just using it to focus on america where they do n't have many sales taxes .
