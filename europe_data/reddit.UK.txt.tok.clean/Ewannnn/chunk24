  isil are n't his main opposition . 
  ah yes , this is true . 
  if we left the eu it would likely mean more agreements like ttip as that 's one of the main reasons to go ( more trade deals ) . 
  id like to see european wide parties in elections rather than associations . 
  i think then people would go out and read more about the different parties . 
  [ their debt has n't really changed ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/270409/national-debt-of-greece/ ) , their gdp has just shrunk a lot . 
  as long as we 're only bombing isis i do n't have an issue with it . 
  i do n't think we should get involved in the conflict with assad though - we ca n't & should n't go to war with every dictator in the world ... 
  these seem like pretty weak arguments ... 
  he starts off by telling us migration is good for us , then says it 's bad for the poorer states . 
  even if you agree with that premise is n't that the responsibility of those states ? 
  i do n't really see that as a negative . 
  on the topic of immigration caps the 10s of thousands figure is laughable , that would require ridiculously large cuts to immigration from eu & outside . 
  even if we left the eu they would still need to cut immigration ( [ net migration ignoring eu is ~ 150k ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/may-2015/stb-msqr-may-2015.html#tab-3--emigration-from-the-uk ) ) . 
  but again , this is n't a positive unless you inherently favour non eu migrants , which i do n't ( quite the contrary actually ) . 
  at least while in the eu they ca n't mercilessly cut the immigration numbers for political reasons . 
  then we come to ttip , the deal that no one has even read yet so ca n't even comment on properly . 
  again , not a negative , * yet * . 
  the cap issue i can understand but still i believe food security is important & keeping our agriculture business alive is inherently a national security issue imo . 
  especially considering future changes due to climate change will decimate agriculture in many parts of africa & europe , relying on production outside our borders is quite a dangerous route to go down . 
  from a leftie perspective coming from the uk i see the eu as protecting certain rights i do n't trust my own government to uphold ( employment rights e.g. 
  wtd , [ environmental issues ] ( http://www.foe.co.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/eu_referendum_environment.pdf ) ) . 
  i do n't really see [ my government ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rgx91rq5i ) as that democratic & i do n't trust them at all to represent my views at the moment . 
  i also feel other eu countries are more left wing than the uk & that is represented in the eu parliament makeup & the kind of legislation the commission proposes . 
  i do admit this is kind of an ironic opinion considering how undemocratic the eu is currently ( in terms of turnout , not the process ) . 
  hopefully in the future people will get involved more in eu elections & we 'll see less parties like [ ukip ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_members_of_the_european_parliament_for_the_united_kingdom,_2014%e2%80%9319 ) ( greens/liberals should be getting way more meps , people are n't going out to vote ! ), 
  getting so many seats here !, 
  [ you 're on par with poland it seems . 
  ] ( http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/income-inequality/#income-inequality-before-and-after-taxes-and-transfers-max-roserref ) that probably has more to do with what you 're spending your revenue on though . 
  the irish tax system is n't very progressive , ~ 40 % or so is from sales taxes which is one of the highest in the eu . 
  in total you spend ~ [ 83 % ] ( http://www.publicpolicy.ie/irelands-current-fiscal-profile/ ) of revenue on healthcare , social protection & education . 
  in the uk it 's 67 % & just [ over 1/3 ] ( http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/year_spending_2013uktn_14tc1n#ukgs302 ) of that is on pensions where i believe [ ireland spends a lot less . 
  ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/social-welfare-ireland-elderly-1185772-nov2013/ ) pretty warranted to be honest , most of the wealth is already concentrated in the elderly so it does n't make sense to plough more money there from a redistribution standpoint . 
  we spend far far far far too much on pensions here it 's ridiculous . 
  when my parents were my age the national insurance rate was 6.5 % , now it 's 12 % !, 
  we do n't get anything more for our money , on the contrary i doubt i 'll ever even be able to retire !, 
  kicking greece out of the eurozone is n't keeping it safe , it 's putting the very system in danger which is why the markets are becoming so volatile : no one knows what is going to happen . 
  you also have the issue of the precedent this sets , there are other economies within the eurozone that are also on the brink of being in the same situation as greece . 
  if greece ends up exiting interest rates on debt issued by all those countries will go up through fear the same thing will happen . 
  shame it has no planes ... 
  we are , albeit * much * less than other countries , via the imf . 
  agreed also in terms of equality , you should look at the [ progressivity of the taxation , the level of the taxation & the effect the spending has on inequality ] ( http://gregmankiw.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/what-nation-has-most-progressive-tax.html ) . 
  simply looking at tax revenues is n't showing you the full picture . 
  you could have massive tax revenues but also massive inequality due to it being regressive for instance . 
  agreed , it 's the same reason the americans stay so close to saudi arabia . 
  it 's incredibly important that country is pro western , even if they have elements within their own government which are n't . 
  sure , but the war against isis is certainly having an effect on you . 
  if anything you 're suffering the most of the western countries . 
  increased crime , lost revenue , costs to house them which could be spent on healthcare & other things . 
  just because you have n't suffered from a terrorist strike yet does n't mean you 're not being harmed by what isis are doing . 
  i do n't know , when greece leaves the ez they 'll be ripe for exploitation . 
  everything will be selling for peanuts . 
  our austerity , which while we like to complain , was n't anything like in greece . 
  i mean look , the [ two ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/government-spending ) graphs [ are ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-spending ) going in completely different directions ... 
  the big difference is their economy is in freefall , ours is n't . 
  their spending to gdp ratio actually went up massively while ours went down . 
  his argument is n't really related to wealth inequality , all he 's saying is that they need stimulus to grow their economy . 
  this echoes their reaction to the financial crisis that pushed much harder for stimulus than the eu countries did . 
  brutal austerity like what greece has had to endure just results in a vicious downward spiral & that 's exactly what we 've seen happen . 
  holy shit , that 's totally barbaric . 
  severely injure someone & then start firing at the fucking crowd going to help him . 
  these people are fucking sick . 
  good luck getting the dutch , danes & other northern states to integrate unless you want to remove them too ? 
  expecting everyone to move at the same speed & then removing anyone that does n't agree is n't going to work . 
  [ you sure ? 
  agreed !, 
  commenting in those threads beyond the first few hours is pointless . 
  with the way reddit is set up only the posts from the first few hours even show up . 
  urgh on point two . 
  cameron has been using this since the financial crash to justify cuts . 
  `` but look at greece '' `` muh strong economic plan ! '' . 
  as if we 're in even remotely similar situations ... 
  lagarde seemed positive in her interviews , i think there is definitely hope after the referendum but greece should n't be expecting a better deal than they 've already been offered . 
  they 're willing to pull the plug for sure . 
  to be fair we were n't supporting greece we were supporting the banking system . 
  that 's where the money primarily went , not to greece . 
  furthermore the effect on the bond markets from the bailout has saved all ez economies billions and billions in interest , especially germany where they all flock to lower their risk . 
  this whole thing was far from altruistic . 
  that 's what the type 45 is for  we also have a lot of aircraft already stationed at the falklands . 
  i think [ we 'll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_royal_navy_ships ) be [ ok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_argentine_navy_ships ) . 
  argentine equipment has n't really changed since the last war . 
  the tech difference now is ridiculous . 
  why are you editorialising the title . 
  you are making it sound like there is no hope after tuesday which is quite contrary to what she is saying . 
  * `` final question : we get to sunday , and if the deadline has passed by then , you talked about legally it does n't have a framework , but listening to yanis varoufakis saying that , if there is a yes , if people say we want to stay , we want to agree to these proposals , is it your understand that there could be a chance that they 're resurrected ? '', 
  `` to quote somebody else , when there is a will there is a way . 
  at the bottom of it it has to be balanced , there is a will there is a way on both sides , there are reforms and measures , there is financing and debt operation on the other one . 
  '' * i think this referendum will send a clear message to tsipras as to whether they want to do whatever it takes to stay within the eurozone . 
  if it is a yes vote then it is his responsibility to make sure he gets a deal for the greek people , even if it means further cuts . 
  i 'm fine with the status quo , i ca n't think of any laws i have issue with . 
  there is no mechanism to suspend eu membership . 
  about all they can do is fine greece via the ecj for non compliance afaik . 
  we 're in new territory here for sure , who knows what will happen . 
  there 's certainly no way cyprus would vote for a grexit if it came down to it , their economy is massively reliant upon both greek imports & exports . 
  not to mention the debt in cyprus itself ( 110 % gdp , 9 % budget deficit ) could become a problem upon grexit . 
  this is a valid point . 
  i personally believe the parent should make the decision until the child is at the right age to make it for themselves ( which is i believe around 12-16 ? 
  it does , it just puts the emphasis on getting vaccinated . 
  there is no forcing here , you are just putting a requirement on attending public school . 
  parents are still free to choose to homeschool if they wish .
