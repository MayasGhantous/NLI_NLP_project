  on the contrary i 'm arguing everyone has the right to not get vaccinated , but they ca n't send their kids to public school if they choose to do so . 
  i know the arguments for , but * in my opinion * public safety does not trump a person 's right to decide their own medical treatment * in this case * . 
  this is why i say we should have mandatory vaccination for those who attend public school as it minimises the risk to others while still allowing parents to make their own choices . 
  i do n't like the idea of enforcing procedures on people ( even children ) . 
  i would much rather we strongly encourage people to do so voluntarily . 
  i 'm on the fence with mandatory vaccination , but they could & should make it mandatory for those attending school ( with only medical exemptions ) . 
  can any italians comment on what they 'd like him to do / the eu to do ? 
  much longer asylum claims process , harder to get work , find housing etc. 
  we 're not , they dealt with 22k claims last year , we dealt with 26k . 
  for the size of their population switzerland is doing considerably worse out of the migrant situation . 
  agreed , i 've been thinking we should just have a megathread for greece & migrants especially . 
  i actually filtered out all greece posts with res for a while because it was getting tiresome . 
  by checking traffic levels what do you mean ? 
  as a doctor , i too know many latin words . 
  ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ kidding ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ doctor , ^ ^ ^ although ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ did ^ ^ ^ study ^ ^ ^ latin ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ school . 
  if it does not stop them why are all these migrants in calais & not in the uk ? 
  do you think they want to be in calais ? 
  essentially what you 're saying is borders are pointless , they can not stop any migrants from crossing at all . 
  you can also use them as propaganda to convince others not to leave . 
  these people have seen first hand the atrocities isis have carried out . 
  they 've chosen to return so at least in most cases they 've decided they do n't agree with isis any more . 
  it will be intriguing to see what he does next . 
  of course & they can keep trying , some will get through some will not , just as in calais . 
  but certainly many less than if there was no border at all !, 
  without schengen they would have a policed border yes . 
  some would of course get through , just as they get through via calais to the uk , but it would be a lot less than is currently the case . 
  right now they can go wherever they want , there is nothing stopping them until they reach calais . 
  if we did n't have schengen france et al would police their borders & not let any migrants in whether refugee or not . 
  the italian/french border would become like calais essentially . 
  once they 're inside your border you have to deal with their claim but you can prevent them from entering to begin with . 
  [ bbc have a fantastic documentary ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b05yxzlj/napoleon-episode-1 ) about napoleon airing at the moment [ note : iplayer only available with uk ip ] . 
  worth a watch , really paints napoleon in a different light compared to how we usually see him portrayed in the uk . 
  shown as a fantastic general , statesmen & champion of equality for the time . 
  how so ? 
  italy is not rejecting migrants , this is no change from the status quo aside from the fact they may be distributed somewhat more evenly . 
  this is purely to relieve strain on certain states within the eu , it sends absolutely zero message to those outside the eu . 
  schengen makes it everyone else 's problem though rather than just italy 's . 
  there 's a reason the uk only deals with 26k asylum claims to france & germany 's 67k & 97k respectfully - most of them never get here because we 're outside schengen . 
  i do n't mind debating with people but when they only post in migrant threads it 's clear they have an agenda . 
  furthermore when you have people suggesting we should just let them all drown in the ocean you know they 're just trolling . 
  we can do whatever we want , it just has to apply to uk citizens too . 
  the reason we have this problem is that our system has no requirements at all . 
  for instance if i move to denmark i could n't claim unemployment benefit because to claim it you need to work there a certain amount of time first . 
  why would quotas have changed anything with regards to economic migrants , they were only for refugees . 
  the only reason to have them was so that the burden was more evenly shared instead of 6 states dealing with 86 % of eu asylum claims & one state dealing with 40 % on their own . 
  this & the greek crisis make it pretty clear how inept the eu is at actually dealing with crises . 
  as tusk said `` it will take much time to build a new european consensus on migration '' . 
  by the time we actually come to a decision the crisis will be over ... should note that the longer it takes for us to stop burying our head in the sands & help italy out the more economic migrants will end up on our borders . 
  right now italy does not have the capability nor the incentives to actually deal with the asylum claims which means a constant stream of migrants heading deeper into the eu . 
  you see this in france too , why do you think they are not dealing with the migrants in calais ? 
  it 's exactly the same reason italy does not deal with the ones within their borders either . 
  i do n't know where they come from , but they only seem to show up in migrant threads . 
  i have quite a few of them tagged . 
  every hour is anti immigration hour on / r/europe these days mate . 
  so i guess they 're changing themselves to a milk based diet ? 
  sounds tasty . 
  immigration is good for the pension crisis , more young people makes it easier to pay for the old people . 
  our population pyramid is messed up because of the massive population boom in the 60s followed by a rapid fall in fertility . 
  ideally we need to maintain the base population we had in the 60s . 
  [ see here ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/interactive/uk-population-pyramid---dvc1/index.html ) to understand what i mean . 
  true but they benefit via faster growth being inside the eu . 
  it 's obviously a net positive for them , poland for instance receives billions in funding every year for their development as do other eastern european states . 
  the pension system in this country is structurally flawed though anyway . 
  ni should be removed & pension spending taken from general taxation . 
  pensions should also be means tested . 
  the current system is incredibly unfair on the working age population . 
  it 's just another regressive form of taxation that promotes further inequality . 
  i think everyone hates gypsies to be honest . 
  it 's a warranted stereotype , they really do trash the places they live . 
  more immigrants that come here & pay tax the more money the governments makes in revenue . 
  they can use that money to pay for the services the immigrants use or they can just not spend it & have a lower deficit . 
  it 's not then fair to blame shortages in public services on immigrants , as without those immigrants our deficit would be larger ( lower gov. 
  revenue ) . 
  the money is there it just depends what you want to spend it on . 
  they could also raise taxes to free up more money to spend on public services that are in dire need right now . 
  the tax system is regressive as it is ( top 10 % pay lower rate than bottom 10 % ) so we could do with some redistribution right about now . 
  * in england and wales in 2013 , births to mothers born in the european union ( eu ) , excluding the uk , represented 8.7 % of all live births ( figure 3 ) . 
  births to mothers born in one of the 13 countries that have joined the eu since april 2004 represented the majority of these births ( 6.1 % of all live births ) . 
  mothers born in the middle east and asia contributed 9.5 % of all live births while mothers born in africa contributed 5.2 % .

  agreed , it suits the tories quite nicely to blame problems in public services on immigration too , all the while cutting back on spending . 
  regarding jobs , that 's only an issue during periods of depression ( so 2009 onwards ) , before then ( 2004-09 ) it was n't an issue . 
  yea i think it probably has an effect at the moment , just as it does on unemployment right now too . 
  i 'm not convinced it has an effect during periods of good economic growth though ( 04-08 ) . 
  probably why ukip have only been getting popular recently . 
  main cause of inequality is the [ regressive tax structure ] ( http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/unfair_and_unclear.pdf ) . 
  every time the tories cut income taxes it gets even more regressive too . 
  i do n't see this ever changing as neither main party is interested in changing the tax system , even ` supposedly socialist ' labour . 
  sure , i can understand that . 
  unemployment does n't seem to be affected very much by it though , as in it did n't suddenly go up after the expansion in 04 ( until the crisis in 08 ) . 
  i guess eu migrants also create a lot of jobs perhaps as well as take them . 
  for me i 've never really seen it as much of an issue , wages are still increasing at the same rate , unemployment steady , again until 08/9 . 
  for me the problem with migration is that communities often tend to cling together rather than assimilate evenly . 
  so for instance near me there is a primary school where almost all the kids are polish . 
  for me that seems problematic & we need to come up with ways to distribute groups of people better . 
  why do you think eu migrants are an issue out of interest ? 
  i do n't think we 'll leave & i do n't think we 'll get many concessions .
