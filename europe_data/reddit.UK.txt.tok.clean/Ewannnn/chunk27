  this sort of action would send a green light to russia . 
  it 's this kind of double standard which causes us to lose all respect in the middle east & other areas . 
  most people have already rejected it in their mind . 
  there 's no way they 'll be objective when it 's finally released . 
  this whole thing is a total farce . 
  he 's a libertarian , what he wants for the country can be very very bad . 
  just look at the usa to how such views can truly fuck up a country . 
  about the only view i can agree with him on is government surveillance , pretty much everything else is very misguided . 
  why do you think people are getting so worked up over this ? 
  they did n't in the past & they are n't getting worked up over ceta which is in it 's final stages at the moment . 
  damn man you 're living the dream !, 
  people have been predicting collapse for yonks & it has n't happened . 
  of course their yields will eventually rise but not while their debt is so high . 
  what changed ? 
  and here lies the problem !, 
  which is why we need to deal with these claims * outside of the eu * . 
  even if they 're not refugees you ca n't freaking deport them !, 
  need to stop them getting here to begin with . 
  i was mostly going by [ this article ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/mwakatabe/2015/01/18/japans-fiscal-situation-is-not-as-bad-as-many-assume/ ) on forbes . 
  you can see on page 2 they estimate the net debt in 2013 to be 90 % of gdp . 
  if you then account for the bonds the boj holds , that they can essentially hold onto for forever if need be the percentage is even lower ( 41 % from the article ) . 
  you can also see the debt ownership [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/boj-becomes-biggest-japan-government-bondholder-1403077610 ) you can see here [ yields have been low for ~ 20 years now . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/japan/government-bond-yield ) essentially my point is they 're actually in a decent place fiscally & their debt burden can make it seem much worse than it actually is . 
  anyone would be foolish to think the japanese will have issues in their bond market , 
  plus if you 're from poland you have the green card lottery !, 
  but yea , it 's difficult , although difficult for everyone . 
  well i did n't say it would be easy but it should n't be harder than someone from france for instance , provided you have the right skills . 
  of course in practice that may not be the case with france having more renowned education institutions etc. 
  i mean even from uk i ca n't get a work visa for america easily either so i 'm not sure what you 're asking for here . 
  so containing nothing of substance then . 
  not surprising , i can see this is what most of the campaign is going to be like . 
  listening to farage has always been a bit like reading the daily mail , filled with emotional arguments & unsubstantiated or misleading ` facts ' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_day i did n't know either , it 's obviously not a thing in england . 
  `` a name day is a tradition in many countries in europe and latin america that consists of celebrating a day of the year that is associated with one 's given name . '', 
  it appears my name [ does n't even have a name day ] ( http://www.happynameday.com/query.php ) ... hurray ... 
  i can just hear mr farage now , `` just like across from italy in libya there are a million poles in poland all just waiting to cross the channel to invade england . 
  coming here to steal * your * jobs , * your * healthcare , and * your * livelihood '' . 
  i 'm sure polish people can get a visa for america if they have the required skills . 
  i mean what are you suggesting , that any person should be able to go to america ? 
  what do you mean accepting people from more impoverished countries ? 
  why do the telecoms get away with ripping you off ? 
  is there not sufficient competition to bring down prices ? 
   in a country with weather like california, 
  it 's mostly full time i think [ ( see figure 1 ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/underemployment_and_potential_additional_labour_force_statistics ) . 
  we do have a problem with productivity though , it 's still below pre crisis levels which suggests the work people are doing is n't worth as much as it could be . 
  germany has similar problems while france is doing well on productivity . 
  in context your debt is actually not that large . 
  when you look at the assets the government owns it is not any larger than western european governments . 
  to me it just seems our unemployment is returning to the norm . 
  the country that is doing really good on unemployment is germany , falling far below pre crisis levels . 
  it also puts french unemployment in context as it seems even before the crisis it was quite high . 
  soon we 'll have oculus rift & other vr devices & pretend we live in a country with weather like california ... 
  no , i 'm saying it as specifically germany . 
  there are other countries that agree , austria for example , but germany is the biggest proponent of it . 
  without german support we would be following different monetary policy in europe . 
  france does n't agree with this method , even the uk is not as hot on harsh austerity as germany . 
  their government suffered a 6 point raise in their budget deficit ( 9.8-15 .7 ) in 2009 , the same as the uk ( 5.1-11 .4 ) , so they must have suffered similarly from the financial crisis . 
  i 'm also not just referring to greek banks here but foreign ones that invested in greece presumably under the assumption that they would be bailed out by the eurozone . 
  they already are fined in the way you suggest . 
  the whole migrant issue has led to many companies using different routes as the cost simply is n't worth it . 
  i think forcing banks to hold larger amounts of capital is probably the best solution . 
  [ recent regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basel_iii ) has made good headway on that front although we 're still lagging behind america . 
  actually i 'm pretty much as pro eu as you 're going to get . 
  we played our part too but the germans are the biggest culprits & proponents of harsh austerity . 
  everyone involved in this bailout packet & it 's failure is partly to blame . 
  the whole system is totally fucked to be honest . 
  banks can get away with anything & the public are always expected to bail them out because our economy is so fragile . 
  i mean even if they did go bust they would n't be the ones to suffer it would be the working & middle classes that end up getting fired & losing their savings . 
  really they need breaking up , we need smaller banks & smaller insurance brokers that are n't too big to fail . 
  but they 're right , this is n't the fault of the people . 
  their government was n't even telling them the truth on their financials & even if they were most people could n't tell you the difference between debt & deficit anyway . 
  this is the fault of previous governments that did n't get their financials in order & the bank 's implicit in the cover up . 
  it 's also the fault of the imf/eu because their financial plan has been a total and utter disaster for greece . 
  their projections were utterly wrong & the greek people are paying the price for that cock up & will be for decades to come . 
  if you do n't subsidise renewables how does the market account for costs on the environment ? 
  presumably you 'd be against a carbon tax as well . 
  i ask because the market is n't doing such a good job accounting for environmental & health effects at the moment . 
  damn i must have a bit of portuguese blood in me, 
  ha this is fantastic op although i seriously doubt we drink as much as the russians !, 
  thanks . 
  is this with reference to the greece situation ? 
  what does it say ? 
  i have a question : why does n't russia just invade ? 
  what are they waiting for ? 
  is this a propaganda problem within russia ? 
  i mean from outside russia it is obvious they are stationed within ukraine . 
  i 'm not sure an invasion would change perceptions from outside russia . 
  do they want this conflict to go on as long as possible for some reason or other ? 
  time is not necessarily in your favour , russia will eventually fall under the chinese sphere which is growing in power every year . 
  that 's not a reason to provoke conflict of course just a minor counterpoint . 
  ideally the best case would be to get russia into the western sphere before that happens but i 'm not sure how we can do that while putin is acting the way he is . 
  furthermore russia as an energy superpower is only going to exacerbate over time as siberia melts & other countries stocks decline . 
  technology could make that a mute point though we 'll see . 
  russia being in the western sphere would do a lot for energy security in the long term . 
  really , so wherever you may be from in europe , if you asked someone what a billion was they 'd say a million million ? 
  did n't realise that was the case . 
  next time i meet a european i shall ask them :p, 
  most people do n't use the american billion ? 
  that ca n't be true surely .
