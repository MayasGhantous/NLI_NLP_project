  i 've never heard or seen anyone in any circumstance using the long scale . 
  to be honest there was big support for the war in afghanistan at the time ( even in the uk ) . 
  the problem was the war in iraq ( which i think was somewhat supported in america but not here ) & that we did n't have the capability to fight two wars at the same time . 
  this meant the situation in afghanistan deteriorated & increasing casualties caused support to fall . 
  if we had n't gone into iraq , perhaps just let the americans do it on their own , the situation in afghanistan might have been very different . 
  25-30c all year is what you need . 
  at least with my temperament , someone from denmark or sweden would possibly disagree :d, 
  agreed that would definitely add score to the yes vote . 
  it 's difficult not to poke your nose in when the majority of people here are americans . 
  even on posts that do n't concern americans ( say a news report on an eu issue posted to / r/worldnews ) their politics inevitably comes up . 
  well it is n't as needed on this sub since there is not one nationality on here . 
  the problem is blind patriotism & the reddit downvote system do n't work so well together . 
  yes , the problem is anyone critical of america who is n't american is downvoted to hell . 
  often when making opinions like this on american subs i 'll pretend i 'm american for that reason . 
  it 's difficult to have proper discussion otherwise as the ridiculous american patriotism takes over any logical discourse . 
  you 'll see people arguing for points they do n't even agree with just to prove a european wrong . 
  they ca n't source it because any sources would disagree with them . 
  a few years ago it would have been different ( most crossing the med were economic migrants from tunisia / nigeria ) but now they 're overwhelmingly from syria & eritrea . 
  edit : [ for the downvoters , look at the facts . 
  ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/publications/risk_analysis/annual_risk_analysis_2015.pdf ) yes i know looking at things that disagree with your point of view is painful but at least try it for once . 
  it 's not a new theory , do some research before spouting nonsense , there are dozens of papers & books on this phenomenon . 
  it 's also a case of the elderly not being able to travel . 
  the women do n't just care for the children , they care for the whole family . 
  well they do vote for bad policies from my point of view , this does n't necessarily make them stupid though . 
  of course they probably see liberal policies as stupid as well . 
  i mean as a left leaning person i 'm hardly going to say going to the right is a good thing am i ? 
  except the old age population is getting larger , which was the point to my post . 
  all of europe is becoming more right leaning & our populations are aging at the same time . 
  if your population is bottom heavy you 're going to get more progressive politics . 
  if it 's top heavy it 's going to be more conservative . 
  i think it 's pretty clear that 's the case . 
  ageing population , old people are more likely to vote right in the uk . 
  we 've slowly drifted to the right . 
  makes perfect sense . 
  now we have babestation . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  [ as i said , not in the uk . 
  ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/how-britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide ) [ same trend for 2010 . 
  ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2613/how-britain-voted-in ) con/ukip are the right leaning parties . 
  at least in my country it 's the elderly that tend to vote for more right leaning parties . 
  perhaps that 's not the case here , i do n't know the voting demographics for denmark . 
  ah fair . 
  i 've never seen immigration as much of a right/left issue . 
  are they really labeling him as centre right just because he 's against immigration ? 
  i do n't really follow danish politics much . 
  it is indeed, 
  the uk rate is 20 % but that can be reduced to 10 % iirc on patent revenues as / u/jack _ beauregard pointed out . 
  the uk is n't the real problem though it 's british overseas territories like gibraltar that are within the eu via the uk but have different tax rates . 
  in gibraltar for instance the corp. tax rate is 10 % but that 's only on money made in gibraltar itself which is going to be non existent for most corporations . 
  this means they can get away with paying very little tax if they base themselves there . 
  [ look at the list published by the eu commission ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/gen_info/good_governance_matters/lists_of_countries/index_en.htm ) , like 25 % of those countries are bot 's & many of them have zero effective corporation tax . 
  no me neither , it 's very strange . 
  damn even the traditionally left leaning countries are going to the right ... what is wrong with this world . 
  must be all the old people . 
  you have boobs on outdoor advertising ? 
  daym . 
  in the uk we 're almost as prudish as the americans . 
  on the plus side our tv is a lot less prudish than american network tv . 
  those people in their mercedes always think they have right of way . 
  debt fueled growth is n't sustainable , deficit fueled growth is , provided it does n't exacerbate your debt issue . 
  this is the difference between greece & the countries you 've listed in that they 've managed to reduce their debt burden over time or at least keep it under control . 
  greece on the other hand maintained a deficit so large that their debt did n't decrease at all & stayed at around 100 % for decades , which while not an issue in & of itself became one when the financial crisis hit . 
  greece also does n't have the fiscal controls the other countries you listed have . 
  that 's actually the biggest issue here . 
  almost none of their debt is domestically held either . 
  no corporate tax , no tax on profits . 
  the patent box scheme you were referring to before is just a way to reduce your tax rate iirc , they still pay some tax . 
  they could get rid of the patent box regimes & find other ways to incentivize companies to use patents . 
  it 's not impossible to get rid of these programmes . 
  of course i do n't think governments will do this as it 's unpopular ( god knows why corporation tax is far from progressive ) but it 's a fair suggestion to make . 
  debt fueled growth is going to collapse eventually though , it 's not a sustainable way to run a country . 
  edit : as in you ca n't just keep up high deficits & constantly increase your debt to gdp ratio year on year , eventually all the cards are going to come crashing down . 
  i still think a better solution is just to increase taxes incurred by shareholders ( capital gains ) & employees ( income tax ) . 
  you could even reduce corporation tax to nothing if you do this , then there would no longer be a race to the bottom as everyone is already there . 
  plus it means everyone pays the same rate & are equally competitive in the market instead of large companies getting away with paying nothing while smaller ones have to pay higher rates . 
  i just googled ugly belgian house . 
  quite frankly you continentals do n't know the meaning of ugly houses , you need to walk in an english council estate then you 'll know what real despair looks like !, 
  i think we 'll see a massive population boom in the west as automation takes hold & everyone is cooped up at home . 
  then again we could also just end up having sex in virtual worlds instead in which case the problem will get worse . 
  it would be like in the new [ tv series humans ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4122068/ ) where old people are cared for by human like androids . 
  i 'm betting japan gets there first . 
  i do n't know what that means , but it sounds amusing either way . 
  well you 're right , most do n't read the articles , but it 's annoying for those who do !, 
  [ we already have one like that to keep out the french ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xq2nsfo.jpg ) . 
  historically it 's worked quite well although we did have a slight problem in 1066 . 
  the problem is austerity usually equals austerity for the poor and homeless , more of the same for the wealthy and middle classes . 
  if they raised taxes and cut departments across the board instead of protecting some and imposing savage cuts on others i do n't think people would be nearly as angry . 
  they are n't leaving , the risk of the journey is bigger than staying where they are . 
  if they do leave it 's to neighbouring camps that can barely feed the people living there . 
  look into the camps in damascus . 
  it 's a misunderstanding that if people somehow go further than their immediate border ( so turkey in this case ) they 're no longer refugees but economic migrants . 
  of course it 's bollocks but that 's the reasoning . 
  you know why these countries have high birth rates ? 
  lack of contraception , high child mortality & child labour . 
  you cut aid programmes and birth rates will go up not down . 
  fastest way to reduce birth rates is to provide more aid , we 've seen it work all over asia and the world . 
  this is hilarious . 
  all this fuss over ttip & noone is even talking at all about ceta even though that contains * evil * isds clauses too . 
  is it because canada is not as evil as ` murica ?
