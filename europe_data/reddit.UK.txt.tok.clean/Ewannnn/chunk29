  every article just seems to be a copypasta of the same press release . 
  ca n't find anything else he 's said , just that one sentence . 
  edit : [ here is his statement . 
  typical i ca n't find it anywhere other than italian sites ... ] ( http://www.ansa.it/sito/videogallery/italia/2015/06/17/renzi-e-impossibile-una-unione-europea-senza-linghilterra_61e52400-c25b-4cb2-bc17-6711326010f7.html ), 
  it 's not just private insurance that 's the problem , the whole ethos of healthcare is messed up . 
  there 's no cost benefit analysis of anything , you go in you get a million tests you do n't really need , you get the most expensive treatment even if it 's only marginally better , are offered the most expensive drugs which the doctor is pushed to recommend by pharma companies ( not to mention advertised ) . 
  but yea the big thing is private insurance companies . 
  i mean hell your government ca n't even negotiate good deals on drugs that could save them billions & billions of dollars because congress mandated insurance companies must do it for them . 
  but people keep electing them time & time again . 
  that 's why i say it 's obvious people do n't want change . 
  people on reddit certainly do but they 're not like most people in the real world . 
  i wish this forum & others would just ban the linking of articles that are behind paywalls . 
  it makes discussion beyond the title itself very difficult when you ca n't even read the article . 
  for reference uk spending is above the 2 % but still below the spending of russia . 
  i personally think keeping the 2 % level is the right amount as that 's what we 're committed to being inside nato . 
  i do n't think we should spend any more however & we definitely should n't be trying to match russia , china or anyone else . 
  what truth ? 
  americans do n't want state healthcare . 
  they also ca n't cut military spending because jobs rely on it . 
  even if the eu massively increased spending it would n't have any effect on america aside from moving their troops to the pacific . 
  it 's also not one or the other , i mean christ the american government spends as much on healthcare as a percentage of their gdp as we do . 
  does sweden have a problem with house planning or something ? 
  why would they have a housing shortage ? 
  you can have localised problems but if planning is n't a concern you can always expand . 
  to be honest i 've changed my mind on this to a certain extent & will support my country 's opt out . 
  the reason being that we 're already contributing to humanitarian causes abroad via [ our foreign aid budget ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_governments_by_development_aid ) which is far larger than any other eu country or indeed any country in the world bar america . 
  i think to accept thousands more refugees on top of this spending would be too much ( housing refugees in the numbers we 're talking about costs billions of dollars ) . 
  people do n't support it either , they just do n't , and the eu needs to find a solution to this problem that does n't just involve inviting hundreds of thousands of refugees to live here permanently . 
  that 's not to say i do n't agree we should accept these people in the short term but it 's just not a long term solution to the problem . 
  the effects of global warming on the sub saharan region especially are going to be catastrophic & we need to be looking 10 or 20 years down the line . 
  an open doors policy with no appreciation for the socioeconomic consequences just is n't the right call here & a quota system puts us firmly in that direction . 
  id like a citation for that last red point . 
  can norway avoid most eu regulation for instance ? 
  i do n't believe that 's the case but i could be wrong . 
  the main problem for most brexit advocated is freedom of movement and contributing to the eu budget , we would n't avoid either of those . 
  our per capita wealth is lower than most of western europe . 
  our income inequality is higher than all of western europe . 
  our minimum wage us lower i believe than all of north west europe ( france upwards ) . 
  the main reason is language i believe as you pointed out as well as our welfare system being more generous . 
  those are the two primary reasons . 
  many eu countries do spend more on welfare but it has requirement and is contributory . 
  they wo n't agree to any quota plan & their asylum process rates are tiny . 
  centre right ( norway ) vs centre left ( sweden ) leadership would be my guess ? 
  right wing parties tend to be less open to immigration , especially from people claiming asylum . 
  the social democrats are in coalition with the greens too in sweden . 
  you know what , i do n't know the answer as i ca n't find any info anywhere about the actual size of their state pension fund . 
  my original point , and understanding from reading articles on the subject is that it is a pay as you go system . 
  this means that payments to claimants is paid for by working employee contributions . 
  any overflow is used to buy government bonds but that overflow is tiny & the amount of assets held at any one time is small . 
  any loss in value of government bonds would n't have a large effect on the ability for the fund to pay out . 
  what would have an effect is a reduced workforce paying in contributions . 
  this is what all these kinds of funds suffer from & you either pay for it via increased contributions , higher retirement age or top ups from other forms of taxation - the uk/american pension system will go bust within 10-20 years for instance without changes . 
  but as i said , i ca n't find figures so this could all be nonsense & it could work differently . 
  if you have figures yourself i would be interested in seeing them ( genuinely ) . 
  dude . 
  wtf are you saying , i ca n't understand frog language . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ smelly ^ ^ ^ ^ frogs ^ ^ ^ ^ always ^ ^ ^ ^ thinking ^ ^ ^ ^ they 're ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ best . 
  haha just wait till the eu referendum is near , the brexit posts will be everywhere . 
  urgh i facepalm whenever i read a thread about europe or the uk in / r/worldnews . 
  the ignorance in that sub is unbelievable . 
  i mean we had the migration thread on / r/all yesterday & the thread on greece today . 
  thing is , the last 2 years italy has basically just let migrants go where they want & no one has stopped them ( due to schengen ) . 
  now with france closing their borders & others threatening to do the same the situation has become untenable . 
  italy basically has the same situation that is happening in calais but x1000 . 
  to be honest the fact that border countries do not receive almost any monetary support for their borders is quite frankly insane & very unfair . 
  even under a quota system border countries would still be liable to deal with _ all _ asylum claims . 
  the effect on their judicial system & the cost involved in this is huge . 
  if this is what the eu want they will need to pay them adequately & provide judicial support if needed as well . 
  not to mention these claims can take * years * , where the heck are italy & greece suppose to house these * hundreds of thousands * of claimants ? 
  as an example it currently costs the uk government # 14,500 per asylum claim & they expect italy to deal with 400,000 + asylum claims ? 
  where i worked the till would n't even open without putting in a transaction . 
  of course you could put in something different but that 's what they have cameras for , to check employees are n't stealing among other things . 
  plus you can check stock levels to make sure they coincide with sales etc. 
  of course we can , we could do whatever we want . 
  but as i said it relies on international support otherwise it damages our image around the world . 
  just because you can do something does n't mean you should do it . 
  kind of undermines our position in ukraine too , we 're here telling russia `` stop violating ukraine 's sovereignty ! '', 
  meanwhile just over the med we 're invading libya dropping random people off on their shores . 
  it 's why the bombing action was turned down too as libya did n't support it . 
  there would need to be a consensus of support both internationally & within libya itself . 
  as was the case when military action was taken . 
  they could always jump overboard . 
  at the end of the day if people want to get somewhere there 's little you can do to stop them is my point . 
  aside from locking them up or killing them . 
  so then they sink their boat , what do you do ? 
  others have covered this but that would violate libyan sovereignty . 
  you ca n't just dump people on foreign soil . 
  ya but what i 'm saying is the overflowing funds are not going to be very large ( actually currently there will be no overflow , that 's the problem ) . 
  that is what i mean by a pay-as-you-go system . 
  in terms of how much money was lost by this fund it will not be large . 
  this is different to a regular private pension where money is built up over time , in this instance large amounts of money would be lost . 
  i mean greece already has a much older population than most countries , this kind of pension system is n't sustainable for them . 
  even here in the uk where we run a similar system it is likely to run dry by 2027 when the surplus disappears due to an aging population . 
  what ? 
  that seems like a terrible plan . 
  vat is not at all progressive & that will just make poor / unemployed greeks even worse off . 
  that 's only within the eu ( dublin ii ) & only if they registered in that country . 
  even with that agreement in place many western european countries refuse to deport them to greece for instance because the conditions there are so bad . 
  well it 's a distinction that must be made considering the [ top three migrants into the eu via the med ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/jun/10/migrants-crossing-the-mediterranean-key-numbers-libya-european ) are from syria , eritrea & somalia . 
  the way you phrased your response it 's as if most sub saharan migrants were n't desperate or refugees .
