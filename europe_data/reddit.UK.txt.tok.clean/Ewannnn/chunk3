  / u/reilly616 can you comment further on the three posts per story idea ? 
  how would you police that , is it three posts per day ? 
  by story do you mean posts on a single topic ? 
  for instance would these three threads be under the same topic ( [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ltk52/iraqis_on_facebook_warn_compatriots_against/ ) / [ 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ltm7d/hungarian_army_given_right_to_use_weapons_against/ ) / [ 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lsm7j/eastern_europe_countries_consider_leaving/ ) ) & count as the three allowed threads ? 
  how would you decide what three posts should appear ? 
  there are scales of quality , or are you suggesting that telegraph articles are as bad as ones printed in the daily mail ? 
  they can ban them for a day , surely there are records of that ? 
  i 've never been a mod so i do n't know what records are held . 
  well you can ban frequent offenders , but to permaban someone on their first mistake is kinda stupid . 
  did you watch miyazaki films ? 
  i was brought up on moomins , transformers , x men & studio ghibli films , 
  he was joking . 
  i 'd make them all mods , i think you 're seriously lacking manpower at the moment . 
  then if there are problems you can always remove them later , you said before they would n't get full permissions from the outset anyway . 
  tabloids are more biased than proper news sources , and tend to sensationalise stuff . 
  for instance , instead of using the dm as a source use the telegraph . 
  you 're going to get a more balanced & fair viewpoint in the latter , even if it does have a more right wing slant . 
  indeed , i 'd support a ban on all tabloids . 
  they 're completely biased & not worthy of discussion . 
  point one i can agree with , as there is another sub for that . 
  i 'm not sure they should be permabanned though , just warned . 
  do n't agree with that . 
  agree with this as i ca n't see any other solution that does n't mean the front page is full of low effort posts on one topic . 
  if people have another solution i 'd hear it , but the net result has to be that most posts on the front page end up not being about one topic . 
  i do n't agree with filters , loads of problems with them . 
  agree with that , the crazies are out in large numbers . 
  [ this post ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europemeta/comments/3lqjip/the_mod_teams_current_plan/cv8mc7f ) sums up the problem quite well . 
  well to be honest it should be allowed but yes of course no one should be pushing anyone to start , it 's definitely a damaging habit . 
  i 'm not sure where i am on the price point to be honest , the tax basically just becomes a regressive tax on poor people . 
  i mean if you look at low earners in the uk they pay almost as much in cigarette duty per year as they do income tax . 
  perhaps they should get some sort of indirect rebate but they still feel the cost when they buy it . 
  retail price + vat ( 20 % ) + cigarette tax of 16.5 % + # 3.79 per 20 cigarettes on top of all that . 
  the tax burden on cigarettes is 77-88 % of the total price . 
  there are obviously no studies directly linking the two , but it 's [ well known ] ( http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2015/04/air-pollution-costs-european-economies-us$-1.6-trillion-a-year-in-diseases-and-deaths,-new-who-study-says ) that air pollution is really damaging . 
  i too would say he 's probably correct to say it 's more damaging than second hand smoke unless you 're regularly around smokers , for instance if you work in a club or bar where smoking is allowed . 
  in the uk at least smoking is banned in public spaces now so second hand smoke is n't really an issue any more , the problem is more the cost on the health service due to smoking related illness . 
  then again smokers tend to die young so they may end up saving the health service money in the long run . 
  huge taxes ( 20 % vat plus 16.5 % of retail price plus # 3.79 added on top of all that ) . 
  intriguing fact : of the bottom 10 % of earners in the uk , they spend on average 3.6 % of their gross yearly income on tobacco duty ... lol . 
  they spend only slightly more on income tax !, 
  yea in the uk it 's definitely in the news a lot less to be honest , corbynmania kinda took over . 
  it 's actually [ very effective ] ( http://taglog.ml/stats/intersect-sub-europe-vs-meta-whiterights-no-meta-meta-meta-fempire-min-5-frommin-5.png ) , this is an intersection of all users that post on far right subreddits as well as / r/europe . 
  the megathreads were removed on august 16th , at which point the amount of posts doubled . 
  whether they 're logical or not is rather academic when you 're relying on money from outside investors . 
  any idea when refugee fatigue will come in ? 
  lol , i was reading on the guardian about this : * `` the neo-fascist organisation won 6.9 % of the vote in january despite the vast majority of its mps being behind bars on charges of running a criminal gang masquerading as a political party . 
  three days before the election , on the eve of the second anniversary of the brutal stabbing of pavlos fyssas , an anti-fascist greek rapper , the party 's leader nikos michaloliakos conceded `` political responsibility '' for the killing . 
  '' * like what ? 
  how can anyone vote for them ? 
  [ live results in english . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/sep/20/greek-election-live-results ), 
  to me this looks like both parties are accountable . 
  i 'll amend my statement to say neither of them should be in power ... 
  projections based upon the exit poll put syriza with [ 130 seats , 21 short of the 151 required for a majority .

  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/20/greek-general-election-results-alexis-tsipras-syriza-meimarakis-new-democracy-live ), 
  would this give them enough seats to form a government ? 
  are n't new democracy the party that lied about their deficit & put greece in this situation to begin with ? 
  one would hope they do n't get in power again if they still have the same mps ... 
  you ca n't afford to stagnate while everyone else grows otherwise you just get more & more poor in relation to them . 
  if your per capita gdp is n't growing that 's a very very worrying sign . 
  a lot of it is getting papers is difficult . 
  the embassy may charge large sums of money because ultimately they may not want to accept the person back . 
  legal fees are part of it as well . 
  the fee in the uk for deporting people that do n't want to leave was # 11000 ( this is 05/6 it may be more now ) but for those that leave voluntarily it is # 1-2000 . 
  the cost of flights etc is very small . 
  what 's with the flag man ? 
  [ this is the source ] ( http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2233806.ece ) from the [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reform_of_the_united_nations_security_council ) i read . 
  sure but i ask you this question , how are government spending cuts going to help the economy ? 
  finland should be looking how to solve their growth problem not their deficit . 
  you ca n't just accept that your growth is going to permanently stagnate ... 
  i agree efficiency is good , cutting employees that are doing jobs that others could be doing for instance , plus the holiday time reductions will improve efficiency . 
  meanwhile they should invest money into infrastructure to get those people & others into work - finland has quite a problem with unemployment . 
  i 'm just not convinced about the salary reductions , that does n't really help with efficiency it just harms consumption . 
  it helps with their deficit but as i said before , that 's not a huge problem . 
  china has actually put forward support for india 's membership to the unsc . 
  i believe india is the only claim supported by all members of the unsc . 
  so what 's england 's chances looking like ? 
  i do n't really watch rugby . 
  some basketball thing , they 're crazy about it in eastern europe i think . 
  their deficit will disappear naturally as long as they can get their economy moving , that 's what i mean by structural primary balance deficit , ie the deficit ignoring the business cycle plus debt repayments . 
  that 's why i say current spending is n't unsustainable . 
  they should n't cut to gain a surplus , that 's a stupid idea with their debt level . 
  ideally they should have a small budget deficit . 
  it 's pretty sustainable , their structural primary balance deficit is < 1 % of gdp . 
  they could do with closing that gap but the sky is hardly falling . 
  they should n't be trying to fix such a small budgetary problem while in recession . 
  indeed , they 'll weather the storm fine . 
  i respect them for not wanting to ruin their way of life & race to the bottom like many other countries think we should . 
  when the economy is in recession ? 
  yes , of course you do . 
  finland is n't even in a similar situation to the piigs , they have huge fiscal flexibility . 
  how about your fellow frenchman piketty ? 
  their deficit / debt is tiny , they could maintain current spending for decades as long as their economy did n't contract massively . 
  full stats [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6996925/3-18092015-bp-en.pdf/b0377f79-f06d-4263-aa5b-cc9b4f6a838f ) & [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_quarterly_report ) , note that this is just asylum applicants , it does n't count everyone that has crossed into europe . 
  many may have been deported without claiming asylum for instance . 
  the numbers from syria have n't changed hugely in proportion to the total , they 've been 20-25 % for the last 3 years . 
  what 's worrying to me is this [ graph ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/bf7181d7459cba98c5fb30f57201d519.png ) , obviously the current process for dealing with asylum cases is just too slow , they 're only getting through around 50,000 cases per month . 
  it will take the eu years to get through this backlog ( ~ 1 year assuming zero new entrants ) & meanwhile these people , around half of which will have their claims denied , get to stay here .
