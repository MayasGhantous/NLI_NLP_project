  furthermore no one is agreeing on a way to distribute them even if they processed them outside the eu . 
  they will try to make it as difficult as possible to claim here as they 'd rather other countries have to shoulder the load . 
  it 's basically the bomb , destabilise & run approach we 're all so used to in the west . 
  bring on the downvotes ... 
  ever thought that perhaps travelling across multiple countries then by boat is a difficult journey for an old person to do . 
  women often can not leave either because they are the caregiver in most of the world . 
  i really do recommend you do some reading on this , women and families are usually under represented .

  [ edit ] ( https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zm-wawaaqbaj&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) - page 60 onwards should give you some explanation . 
  `` pesky euros coming over here stealing our jobs ! '', 
  both germany & japan were democratic until the 1930s . 
  iraq never really had democracy , they had ottoman rule followed by multiple coups & dictators all the way up until after the 2003 iraq war . 
  it 's my understanding the imf want to cut pension spending to high earning greeks while retaining payments to those who are in poverty . 
  this does n't seem an unreasonable position , in my opinion they should outright cut pensions to those who can afford the haircut . 
  you have to bear in mind the greek state pension system is pay-as-you-go , the budget relies on contributions from workers . 
  with so many unemployed it is not sustainable any more & must be heavily cut to remove any deficit . 
  this just seems obvious to me , they may not be able to control taxation ( as in people can avoid it ) but they can most definitely control who gets the benefits they pay out . 
  it was never going to work in iraq , at least not immediately . 
  democracy takes time to develop & they 'd been without it for decades . 
  people alive at the time had no experience of a functional government , all they knew was a brutal dictator . 
  furthermore what iraq needed post saddam was a leader that was supportive of all sides of islam , but what they got was a sectarian shia leader in maliki . 
  another two points worth considering are the us investment in [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ) & [ japan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_post-war_economic_miracle ) post ww2 as well as the continued military presence that continues to this day . 
  we must remember that while iraq was unstable prior to us forces leaving the country it was nothing compared to what happened afterwards . 
  of course but what i 'm saying is the result would have been similar if john smith had been leader . 
  the conservatives were really unpopular at this time as the poll results show . 
  i would n't credit that to him , more to how utterly useless & unelectable the conservatives were at the time . 
  anyone could have won a landslide election in 1997 after major 's government . 
  labour had a 15 point lead over the conservatives in 1994 for instance while john smith was still leader ( he died later that year ) . 
  for reference , david cameron took over leadership of the party in 2005 after blair 's 3rd election win . 
  :d bro do you even geography ? 
  how is that possible ? 
  italian spending on pensions was the highest in the oecd iirc unless they cut it a lot in the last few years .

  [ i 'll just leave this here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) to be honest though it 's my belief that we should be using our * # 12 billion aid budget * to deal with this issue . 
  surely with this kind of ridiculous money ( plus aid from other countries within the eu ) we can come up with a solution that allows these people to escape harm 's way & live in dignity . 
  i ca n't think of a better way to use it than to help people that are literally running from war zones & failed states where they risk death & persecution . 
  to put things into perspective , our aid budget is more than twice the entire government of ethiopia 's budget for fiscal year 2013 ( pop . 
  of 90 million ) . 
  our aid budget is around the same as the yearly expenditure of the government of serbia . 
  your border with hungary is ~ 68 miles long ... 
  the us-mexico border is ~ 1500 miles by comparison . 
  - if you 're arguing this point be consistent in your logic . 
  if the state should have a say in whether related couples can have children they should have the same say with other couples with genetic conditions that can be passed to the child , plus those of old age or acting irresponsibly ( taking drugs etc ) . 
  - following that logic where do you draw the line , at what age should the state disallow couples to have children ? 
  should we have a hard cap on child birth ? 
  this is where the logic breaks down & why peoples arguments are not consistent . 
  this is tantamount to saying using crystal meth should be legal but drinking alcohol should be outlawed , the logic is totally flawed . 
  - following on from this , why is sex criminalised & not the act of child birth . 
  who is harmed when they have consensual sex ? 
  it 's perfectly possible for two related couples to have children safely , they could adopt or they could do ivf like those who are infertile for instance . 
  this is when the argument really breaks down for me & it seems even more apparent that the former argument ( revulsion to incest ) is the reason for illegality . 
  i think really the difference is greece requires being bailed out , france does not . 
  everyone is treating it as if the countries are in the same situation and thus should follow the same rules but that 's hardly true . 
  that being said france should never have signed up to the edp if they have no wish to comply , same for any other countries in breach . 
  [ see here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11495591/first-baby-born-from-ivf-technique-which-eliminates-inherited-disease.html ), 
  but there is * no other circumstance * that i can think of where two consenting parties are prevented from intercourse , even though there are much greater risk groups as i 've already outlined . 
  this leads me to believe this is n't the primary reason for the law being there , the primary reason being revulsion which is the same reason homosexuality was outlawed . 
  that 's why i make the comparison , perhaps revulsion is n't the only reason but it is * certainly * the main one . 
  also note it 's not having kids that is illegal , it 's having intercourse in the first place . 
  this further exemplifies the idea that it 's not * really * based on the child harm argument . 
  so are parents with genetic diseases like huntington 's or neurofibromatosis ( both 50 % chance of transmission to child ) . 
  as are parents that smoke or drink alcohol while pregnant . 
  as are people that eat too much & do n't exercise . 
  as are middle-old age women having kids . 
  shall we just ban everyone without perfect genes from having kids ? 
  not to mention this is going to become a non issue in the coming years due to genetic research anyway . 
  the law does n't prevent any other kind of consensual intercourse whether the child is at risk or not . 
  the law does n't even punish those who smoke or drink alcohol while pregnant despite the disastrous consequences that can have . 
  it 's banned because it 's seen as disgusting in the same way homosexuality was & still is depending upon where you live . 
  if it 's consensual & they 're adults i have no problem with it . 
  incest is illegal for the same reason homosexuality was illegal in most of the world till recently . 
  furthermore the risk is much less than with genetic diseases & even those of old age ( over 40 ) . 
  huntington 's disease for instance has a 50 % chance of being passed to a child but you do n't see the government practicing eugenics when it comes to that & other such conditions . 
  the state should have about as much say in who i have sex with as whether or not i 'm about to eat this doughnut . 
  last time i checked we were n't putting conditions on whether the nhs will treat you or not . 
  so does having kids when you 're old , or having kids with many other genetic diseases . 
  the state should n't be telling people who they can & can not have sex with . 
  [ your pronunciation is the second one ] ( http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vitamin ) , do you use the first one too ? 
  oh ok , that makes more sense !, 
  american football is n't that popular in europe i think . 
  if i 'm honest with you i do n't watch much sport though !, 
  i do n't think i 've ever watched an american football game actually . 
  probably watched football ( or soccer as you call it ) once or twice but never been a big fan of that either !, 
  haha well i did n't ever meet anyone that admitted to it . 
  i would say it 's more of an urban legend !, 
  it made sense to me though , everyone loves canadians !, 
  i was n't trying to be , it 's pronounced [ vit-a-min ] ( http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vitamin ) with ` a ' as in ` at ' & ` vit ' as in ` v-it ' . 
  you 're right we have some messed up words as well . 
  probably best to teach people the most phonetically correct version ? 
  how it is spelt . 
  you mean like herbs pronounced erbs ? 
  aluminium pronounced aluminum ? 
  vitamin pronounced vitemin ? 
  mobile pronounced mobul ? 
  yes the american way is much clearer , much clearer indeed . 
  in terms of accident & not pronunciation i would have thought their learning material & teacher would have the biggest impact . 
  so for instance if their teacher is english they 're undoubtedly going to pick up a british accent .
