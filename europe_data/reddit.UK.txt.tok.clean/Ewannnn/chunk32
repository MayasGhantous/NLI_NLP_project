  many kids on the continent probably learn a lot from tv shows that are full of americans so it 's not really surprising that their accident is american . 
  when i used to backpack around asia ( done it a few times ) there was this rumour that many americans put canadian patches on their backpacks to pretend they 're not american . 
  do n't know how much truth there was to it though . 
  [ you just proved my point for me . 
  how does that work ? 
  aid helps improve development & gdp . 
  more developed countries with better education & access to contraception have far lower birth rates . 
  so actually it 's the opposite . 
  that 's the case with many things . 
  low / non existent military budgets relying on other countries to deal with defense . 
  low / non existent acceptance of refugees relying on other countries to accept them . 
  nothing to be done at the end of the day though , countries are sovereign . 
  just have to discuss & try to persuade others to see it your way . 
  this is the issue with groups like nato & the eu though ( wrt schengen ) , everyone has a responsibility for these things but the burden is n't equally shared at all . 
  agreed , we 've got nukes & we 're an island nation with one of the best navies in the world . 
  the chance of us being invaded by land is effectively zero . 
  - if a proper system was set up visas could be given only for certain countries . 
  if they 're caught in another country they would be deported to wherever they 're suppose to be . 
  - the long term solution is to fix the problem causing these refugees to be displaced in the first place . 
  i 'm not saying we should accept 350k every year indefinitely . 
  we could also provide temporary protection where their case is looked at again every x years & if their home country is now safe they could be sent back there . 
  what i would say is this . 
  if we can create detention centres to process asylum claims at border countries , then send them to another country with proper facilities this would be an adequate solution . 
  the way australia is doing it is ** not ** the right way * at all * though . 
  they 're keeping people in camps in squalid conditions & even deporting genuine refugees back to places where they risk persecution . 
  the detention camps would have to be fit for purpose , not like the ones currently in greece for instance ... 
  however i do n't agree with your basic premise that this is a huge issue for us . 
  the amount of refugees coming here is tiny in the grand scheme of things & if they were properly distributed the number would be even less noticeable . 
  as it stands some states are holding almost no refugees at all ( < 100 ) while others are holding tens of thousands . 
  eu asylum claims last year for instance were ~ 350k , which for a population of 500 million would be basically unnoticeable . 
  i do n't think anyone disagrees that solving the root cause is a priority , but just ignoring the refugee situation is n't a solution . 
  well there are n't countless other options , you 've outlined the only three possibilities ( keep them , send them somewhere else , or return them home ) . 
  the problem is finding another country willing to accept them . 
  i 'm also not sure the eu would want to deport them somewhere unless they knew conditions would be good enough . 
  this is why states are no longer deporting refugees back to eu border states for instance ( as they 're suppose to ) , as conditions there are pretty terrible . 
  refugees are fleeing for their lives , how is sending them back somewhere that they may end up dying a good solution ? 
  well you have to prove you are a true asylum seeker & not just an economic migrant . 
  different countries will have different procedures to test this & the availability of lawyers ( to present your case ) will be different . 
  [ see table 4 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) , the acceptance rates are very different , for instance in sweden roughly 3/4 accepted while in greece only 1/7 accepted . 
  bearing that in mind , you 'd be much better off claiming in sweden than in greece . 
  that 's one of the big reasons so many go to sweden . 
  it 's where they came from & their situation in that place that determines whether they 're refugees or not . 
  whether they travelled through 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 countries before arriving at their destination is completely beside the point . 
  tell me , say you have someone coming from syria to england via calais does that mean they are no longer a refugee ? 
  if they are no longer a refugee can you deport them back to a war zone to die ? 
  if not in your mind where would you deport them to , which states are happy to accept all our refugees ? 
  do you now understand the issue ? 
  of course the ideal situation is to deal with asylum claims at the border to the eu & then distribute them evenly within eu countries . 
  the reason they go to the uk instead of say poland is partly for economic reasons but also because there are communities from their own countries here . 
  regardless for their reasons for coming here it does n't make them any less refugees . 
  it seems countries all over the world are suffering from conservative right wing policies . 
  why are people voting in these nutters ? 
  only ukip meps voted against from the uk . 
  typical , always giving britain a bad name in europe . 
  to my understanding when the boe raises interest rates they 'll sell the bonds back to the market . 
  this should cause any inflation to fall . 
  also a tad hyperbolic , in the article itself it says the market estimates federal interest rates hitting 1.25 pc by the end of 2016 . 
  as far as i can see the article is just saying qe has finally done its job & is bringing europe out of deflation . 
  tax revenue as a percent of gdp in 1996 was 34 % , in 2009 it was 30 % . 
  between 2000 & 2009 it fluctuated around 30-32 % . 
  in greece 's situation they had ample time to cut spending & they chose not to . 
  instead they kept spending above what they could afford , did n't pay down their debt & then ended up in a disastrous situation when the financial crisis hit . 
  45 % of gdp is fine for government spending but only if revenues match it . 
  denmark for instance , another state with high government spending , had revenues of between 46 & 48 % of gdp between 2000 & the crash . 
  is that why anyone posting anything vaguely positive about migrants is downvoted on here ? 
  this is pre ww2 logic all over again . 
  oh the germans are massing troops , no problem . 
  oh the germans are annexing austria , no problem . 
  oh the germans are annexing czech , no problem . 
  oh the germans are invading poland . 
  shit better do something but oh no it 's too late , shame we did n't do something sooner . 
  their spending relative to the size of their economy has decreased though ( from your link ) . 
  it used to be a lot higher than it is today , it 's been decreasing a lot ever since merkel came to power . 
  greece has ran a budget deficit in excess of 4 % of gdp for the last 20 years , meanwhile holding a debt to gdp ratio of 100 % over the same period . 
  their spending has n't been sustainable since before the 80s . 
  their economy was growing at between 3-5 % for most of the last 20 years yet they failed to control their debt . 
  i 'm not sure why they were ever allowed to join the eurozone to begin with , safe to say that mistake wo n't be made again . 
  for anyone wondering , the report does n't seem to be available to read in detail yet . 
  sorry but this is bullshit , most of those claiming asylum here are not from sub saharan africa . 
  furthermore those from sub saharan africa are not ` by default ' economic migrants as you seem to think . 
  do you not watch the news , or [ know anything about eritrea ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/09/world/eritrea-human-rights-violations/ ) ? 
  [ 92 % of asylum applications to the eu from eritrean 's were approved in q4 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_by_outcome_and_recognition_rates,_30_main_citizenships_of_asylum_applicants_granted_decisions_in_the_eu-28,_4th_quarter_2014.png ) . 
  you 'll see in the same link 95 % of syrian applications were also approved , and they make up by far the [ largest number of claims ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) ( see table 1 ) . 
  people in this forum despise asylum seekers / migrants , that is why you get heavily downvoted . 
  it 's always the same , people just have no empathy at all . 
  bomb the boats , lock the gates , not my problem jack . 
  funny because they hate parties like ukip but are n't acting all that dissimilar to supporters of parties like that . 
  nothing stopping newscorp from doing that atm, 
  lol is this a joke ? 
  well countries could always offer to house more refugees if they want . 
  your country for instance processed 185 asylum claims last year , sweden 40000 . 
  this is the problem , no one wants to accept them so no one wants any sort of quota system except the countries already accepting lots of refugees . 
  i 'm not sure that 's true , unless eastern europe becomes more developed than the west they 're always going to end up with few refugees . 
  if their goal is to not have refugees a quota system is n't going to help them . 
  it may help rich s. european states like italy or spain though as when their economy inevitably rebounds they 're going to get more refugees . 
  just so happens that these s. european states currently have very high unemployment !, 
  in terms of finding a solution to why refugees are coming here to begin with that is indeed in everyone 's best interest !, 
  it 's possible to do but it will only happen if other countries are willing to accept more refugees . 
  germany would n't have the votes at the moment as a minority of countries shoulder the vast majority of refugees . 
  they 'd need to get the uk on board probably & i ca n't see that happening .
