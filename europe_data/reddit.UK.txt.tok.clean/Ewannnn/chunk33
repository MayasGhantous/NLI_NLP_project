  what do you mean ` let them in ' . 
  if you mean they are free to go where they please this solves nothing , they will all just go to germany & other rich countries as that 's where the jobs are . 
  if you mean they are not free to go where they please it just moves the problem from germany/sweden 's hands into those on the border which are less able to cope with them . 
  the only way to solve this problem is a quota system otherwise there will always be massive imbalances . 
  how come you ca n't deport them ? 
  that is very strange indeed . 
  if they 're not asylum seekers you should be able to deport them back to their home country . 
  they 'll just share the load as far as asylum seekers go . 
  around ~ 350k applied in 2014 & around 50 % of those were accepted . 
  well yes & no , they can just not join the exchange rate mechanism thereby never qualify for the euro . 
  sweden is doing this & i do n't see them changing their mind any time soon considering they rejected the euro before all this debt crisis started . 
  most of the ukip voters read papers that purposely demonise migrants no surprise there . 
  haha well my opinion is probably quite different to most here ( at least judging by the downvotes most people despise refugees ) . 
  i think the current system is fine in that those who claim asylum here should have their case looked at . 
  i 'm not sure how many appeals they have , i think it is one although it might be more . 
  i 'm ok with this but of course they should be detained during the procedure otherwise we might lose track of them which is a problem ( besides they have no where to live anyway ) . 
  i would be surprised if the netherlands did n't have a similar system to us ? 
  haha that seems to be the current governments plan . 
  sink all the ships in the mediterranean & pretend the problem does not exist !, 
  the ones in calais are economic migrants & those awaiting asylum applications i 'd guess , it probably takes a while , especially if you have to appeal . 
  if they arrive on the plane to the uk they get locked up in detention centres while their case is being seen although i think the government wants to change it so if they get declined once they are deported with no chance of appeal . 
  if this was done properly the procedure you 're saying would result in border countries being responsible for ** all refugees ** crossing via land . 
  if a refugee is granted asylum in say italy but then decides to travel to germany , the germans would be perfectly within their rights to deport the refugee back to italy if they so wished . 
  that 's why they do n't claim in italy but instead wait till they 're in germany . 
  where you claim asylum is where you have to stay , you do n't get free travel within the eu once given refugee status . 
  if you want all claims dealt with at borders & then resettled within the eu what you 're after is what the germans suggested with sharing the burden with a quota system so states are assigned a certain number of refugees . 
  personally i 'm still on the fence regarding this plan , i 'm not sure i like the eu imposing this on member states although i ca n't see them accepting them without being compelled to do so either . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  say someone from syria turns up at our doorstep . 
  he 's a genuine refugee most likely ( 95 % of asylum applications from syria are granted ) therefore we ca n't deport him back to syria . 
  so where can we send him ? 
  shall we contact france & say `` hey man , i 've got so many refugees can you take him ? 
  '' , what do you think france will say ? 
  xd no we have to accept him here . 
  just so happens because of our geographic location it 's more difficult for them to get here , that 's why the large rich countries within schengen shoulder most of the asylum claims . 
  * just because an asylum seeker travelled through 5 safe countries to get here does n't make him any less of a refugee , * as per the link above article 1 of the convention as amended by the 1967 protocol provides the definition of a refugee : '' * a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . . * '' i think we should accept more refugees btw regardless of our geographic location . 
  i do n't think it 's fair that countries like sweden have to deal with so many . 
  i think britain has an especially large moral duty to help considering our recent conquests in the region that as far as i remember sweden did n't even take part in . 
  this would have a few affects - currently the government controls the rep , not parliament . 
  the government & parliament may not always see eye to eye on issues & this would allow parliament to supersede government opinion ( assuming they can get a majority in their respective parliaments ) - currently all they need is a [ qualified majority ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/qualified_majority_en.htm ) to pass most legislation . 
  under this proposal they could block a bill with just 33 % of eu parliaments agreeing to do so , thus meaning it would be slightly easier to stop legislation . 
  what can we do ? 
  when an asylum seeker turns up at our border we have an obligation to hear their case . 
  furthermore if an asylum seeker is already in our territory we can not deport them , where would we send them ? 
  we can not deport them to their home country if their asylum claim has merit & we can not deport them anywhere else as they will not be accepted . 
  this is the issue germany has , there are so many asylum seekers streaming into europe , not registering at border countries & then due to schengen being able to pass freely to the country of their choosing . 
  once there they register & the host state has to look at their case . 
  this is why the germans are so pissed off & want some sort of sharing agreement , why would any asylum seeker claim asylum in latvia when they can go to germany or sweden ? 
  relevant treaty http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees, 
  the spread at the moment is ridiculously messed up . 
  i mean take in terms of economic size , germany is 20 % of the eu gdp but handles 27 % of asylum claims . 
  my country ( uk ) is 14 % of eu gdp but handles just 7 % of asylum claims . 
  then you have countries like freaking sweden 2.4 % of gdp handling 11 % of claims . 
  the other end of the spectrum poland 5 % of gdp handling 0.7 % of claims . 
  when you look at the population of these countries & the amount of immigrants they accept ( especially poland & sweden at opposite ends of the spectrum ) it 's even * more crazy * !, 
  something needs to change , because this is quite frankly not fair . 
  we all live ( well apart from the uk ) within schengen so we have a duty to share these immigrants . 
  it 's not fair to just some states are accepting so many more than others . 
  i mean you have countries like latvia & estonia accepting less than 100 refugees ??!?!?!, 
  this is madness .

  the norm which is lower than the uk ? 
  i mean everyone is a critic now but i wonder what they were saying in 2008-2011 when french growth & productivity far surpassed us . 
  it 's the sovereign debt crisis which is damaging france just as it is all the eurozone economies , they 'll be fine in the long run if they manage to get over this problem without catastrophe . 
  regarding tax & spend socialism , as you put it , i 'd much rather see this policy than the low tax culture we 're trending towards ( emulating america ) . 
  in america over the last 30 years the top 1 % of earners took 48 % of the income growth , the bottom 90 % took 18 % . 
  in the uk the bottom 90 % took 45 % of the growth , in france 70 % of the growth , in denmark 90 % . 
  this is what i mean about growth for growths sake , it 's only good if it actually means people benefit . 
  if you 're pushing for a low tax state you 'll find that 's increasingly not the case . 
  do you drink coffee with breakfast ? 
  i 'd agree it 's weird at dinner though !, 
  ah the fabled growth for growths sake . 
  tell me , what is the point of growth if it is not felt by everyone ? 
  many are telling france they need to strip their employment laws , gut their welfare state & be more like the other european economies . 
  many in france are saying the price is too high & we 'd rather keep our welfare even if it means slower growth . 
  after all once you give up your rights it 's very hard to get them back again . 
  we could learn a thing or two from those frogs over the channel ... 
  better for who ? 
  the problem is we already have a two speed europe & with the eurozone controlling the majority of states they can effectively pass legislation that is punitive to those outside the eurozone . 
  this is n't fair while there are still states within the eu that are not in the eurozone . 
  they 're not looking for a single national government to have veto power , they 're looking for a collective to have the power . 
  currently , if i 'm understanding correctly , if 1/3rd of the national parliaments disagree with a certain legislation they can issue a ` yellow card ' to the eu legislature & this will suggest the legislation should be dropped . 
  what they want , is for this to be a red card , not that the legislation * should * be dropped , but that it * will * be dropped . 
  at least this is how philip hammond explained it on the andrew marr show , he categorically stated it is not a one state veto power , as that would essentially be the end of the eu & is not achievable ( or even wanted ) . 
  of course in practice if 1/3rd of eu parliaments did n't agree with legislation then the bill is unlikely to pass anyway as their representatives on the council would presumably vote it down . 
  it 's because we have a low minimum wage that is n't enough to live on . 
  to compensate for that they have in work benefits which is basically just a subsidy for businesses . 
  if we had a higher minimum wage these benefits would n't be needed but it would be more expensive for businesses to employ people . 
  the main reason he wants to prevent migrants from receiving the benefits is to reduce the migration numbers though . 
  the benefits incentivize people to work here as without them it may not be affordable . 
  he does n't want eu citizens moving here & working on minimum wage , which these benefits promote . 
  more skilled immigrants ( the kind we want ) wo n't be able to claim in work benefits as their salary will be too high . 
  personally i think he 's going about it the wrong way & should just solve the problem in our parliament by restricting the benefits to those who have been resident in the uk for x years or worked in the uk for x years . 
  as long as he did it for uk citizens too this would be perfectly legal . 
  by going about it this way he 's just setting himself up to fail by creating unrealistic targets . 
  idk i can, 
  i do n't know , their productivity is 10 % higher than ours .
