  indeed , i bet the unemployed in france are a lot more happy than the ones here . 
  [ the eu is going to be heavily effected by climate change as far as arable land is concerned . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/climate_change_to_shift_global_spread_quality_agricultural_land_403na1_en.pdf ) we 're going to have to radically shift our food production to keep up existing levels . 
  leave the eu and we leave the single market and the benefits that brings . 
  the ideal situation for us is for other countries to follow eu standards , as we would need to follow them even if we leave as they 're by far our largest single trading partner . 
  there 's a reason all members of the efta are also part of the eea & there is little point being in the eea and not the eu . 
  almost all norwegian parties are pro eu membership for instance even though they 're stopped by their citizens from joining . 
  eu citizens can also vote in local elections iirc, 
  it ca n't help that we send so many ukip meps to the european parliament because no one freaking votes in the european elections . 
  it 's ridiculous , * ukip got the most number of meps * last election !, 
  crazy !, 
  edit : then again , front national got the most number of seats in the french elections too . 
  people really need to take the european elections more seriously . 
  they complain about not being represented then they do n't even vote !, 
  you 're quite right on the first point , i did n't note table 4 , so cheers for that . 
  you 're also correct on the second point too , [ as shown in table 5 on this page ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_quarterly_report ) . 
  i think a lot of the problem is the uneven distribution , some countries are accepting way more than others . 
  i 'm not sure i agree with germany 's quota system either though as i do n't like the idea of the eu imposing immigration directives upon members . 
  i think this could cause a lot of animosity & destabilize the region ( we 'll see more of ukip/nf ) . 
  basically i 'm not sure of a good solution , ideally we could house these people temporarily then deport them back to their countries when the situation has calmed down , but this inevitably never happens . 
  most are n't legitimate asylum seekers , as you can see in the link you posted of the 132000 applications 109000 were rejected . 
  this is quite literally the opposite , that is most applications are bogus & without genuine merit . 
  libya refused to give permission iirc, 
  i need to move to your country . 
  seriously , fuck small talk !, 
  they 'll get away with it as well . 
  germany and others are so reliant on russian trade & energy exports nothing will be done about it in the long term . 
  just forgotten about as soon as the news cycle is over . 
  i 'm a tad lost here . 
  if we get an opt out of the ever closer union phrase what does that even mean for us ? 
  why does it mean anything ? 
  are there somehow strings attached to this phrase ? 
  hmmm wonder how long it will be before americans send in ground troops ( followed inevitably by us ) . 
  i did some research & it seems [ most americans now support ground operations ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/03/12/most-americans-now-support-sending-ground-troops-to-fight-isis-infographic/ ) , that support can only grow as isis gains ground . 
  any americans want to comment on this ? 
  i do n't follow american politics very much but i definitely can not see my country sending in ground troops unless america does so first & even then there is little support for it here . 
  i thought isis was losing ground , is that not the case ? 
  hmm we 'll see but for a country whose main exports are cars & electronics equipment , having a trade deal with the world 's most profitable car market must be pretty good . 
  i see ok , and how are self employed people represented here ? 
  you mean like a certain proposed trade deal ? 
  i 'm not following your point , those working 8 hours a week would n't be considered unemployed . 
  thus a labour market creating many jobs with short hours would have a lower unemployment rate but the amount of hours people are actually working may be similar . 
  the link you posted seems to have some problems with germany too judging from the note at the bottom . 
  edit : nvm the first point see [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/underemployment_and_potential_additional_labour_force_statistics ) & [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/glossary:underemployed_part-time_worker ) . 
  [ oecd puts your avg weekly & yearly hours below france . 
  ] ( https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) that 's why it 's rather amusing hearing a german talk about working hours :p, 
  it did create more jobs at the time , just less than was predicted . 
  also i do n't know how you can say 35 hours is excessively low , what 's the avg working week in germany ? 
  haha quite . 
  france is n't that different to many other western european countries in terms of government spending & taxes . 
  i do n't know what the regulations are like in other countries but perhaps that is the main problem . 
  i do n't think they need to necessarily change their welfare state & short working hours , as i said this is not much different in other countries . 
  i do n't think moving to a more american style of work with long hours & low employment rights is a positive step for society at all , even if it means we are more successful there is more to life than that . 
  an intriguing position coming from the mayor of london ... 
  i have a question for non english speakers . 
  do you guys use the english version of wikipedia much more than your own language version ? 
  til outside of kant\u014d japan really is n't that densely populated , at least less so than my country ( although still high by european standards i guess ) . 
  one wonders how this will change over time . 
  in the uk our pensions are paid for by ni contributions but it relies on what 's being put in being more than what 's taken out . 
  [ this means soon the fund will run dry ( projected 2027 ) ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/98fd339800b9f5823dd0fe60282a249f.png ) & will need to be topped up by [ higher ni contributions ( higher taxes ) ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/12d1ab6b02e4a3faa559e448e1421818.png ) or a smaller pension . 
  just seems another way for the baby boomers to fuck us working age people over continuously till a point comes where it 's [ totally unaffordable ] ( http://i.gyazo.com/8a50cde2e2a645a9c073f8063f79e5ce.png ) . 
  i wo n't be able to claim a pension till the 2060s & who knows what will be available at that point . 
  is it a similar situation in europe or are your pensions actually backed up by sufficient capital ? 
  too late , we already sold it all !, 
  this is from 2013 , not sure lviv in ukraine is such a great place to visit anymore ... 
  agreed !, 
  we should be cutting hours as we become more productive not adding to it !, 
  lot of those probably prefer coming to uk i would think, 
  in the uk it 's going the opposite way , we 're projected to be the most populous country in the eu by 2050 with 77 million people . 
  you need more immigrants !, 
  uk is projected to have larger population than germany by 2050 . 
  not sure that is a good thing mind , my country is quite a lot smaller than yours !, 
  we will have this issue in the uk soon . 
  our state pensions are paid by ni contributions ( tax ) but this fund will soon run out of money ( projected in 2027 ) at which time they will either have to cut the money people get or ( more likely ) raise ni rates . 
  as our population ages this is just going to get more unfair on working age people . 
  not to mention myself ( age 26 ) will probably never get a pension as i wo n't claim it till maybe 2055-2060 so all my ni contributions will be for nothing ... 
  i would support a means tested system so our pensioners are n't put out onto the street but this current system we have is just stupid . 
  you have people with pensions of over # 1 million getting the same as those with no private pension at all ... 
  i wish the uk was more like the germans in this regard . 
  many people waste so much of their work day on things they should n't be doing at work ... like being on here ... 
  it 's enough but only if the population pyramid is balanced . 
  it 's not good if you have a declining or stable population that is aging . 
  that 's what i stated in the sentence , they 're subject to eu laws concerning the single market but not others . 
  beauty is subjective . 
  perhaps someone likes tall blondes , in which case sweden does have prettier women than other countries in europe because they have a larger concentration of women with these features . 
  it actually does n't rain that much , it 's just cloudy most of the time & always a few degrees colder than the south . 
  east/west german divide is no where near north/south italy . 
  look at the gdp per capita of the regions . 
  haha typical british ploy , state that we are not important then wait as other europeans come defend us , thus proving our original assertion that we are not irrelevant , 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but is n't what you quoted essentially the eea . 
  why do we need a new organisation for this ? 
  norway/switzerland etc are part if the internal market without being subject to other eu laws not concerning the internal market . 
  why do we need to remain a world power ? 
  would that be better for us ? 
  why ca n't we just do our own thing ? 
  singapore seems to do fine , south korea , japan . 
  when will people realise you do n't need to be big to be successful . 
  as long as you do n't plan on invading anyone there is no huge benefit to being large . 
  there just seems to be too many unknowns to me . 
  only if you include drugs & hookers .
