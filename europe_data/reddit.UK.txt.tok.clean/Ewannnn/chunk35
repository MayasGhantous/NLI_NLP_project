  [ map of effective tax rates in the eu . 
  ] ( http://www.iiea.com/blogosphere/effective-eu-corporate-tax-rates ), 
  any nation can veto ttip , it has to pass the council unanimously . 
  just a note : cameron is n't eurosceptic . 
  there is a large eurosceptic bloc within his party though which he has to appease ( this has been going on decades , his predecessor john major had real problems with it in the 90s ) . 
  cameron will lobby to stay in the eu regardless of the deal he barters . 
  holy shit that image is amazing . 
  it 's like `` lulwut ? 
  are civil unions legally identical to marriage in rights/protections/privileges ? 
  wow , australia is huge . 
  he 's saying that 's why it 's a good idea to nick norwegian land as it has oil on it ( or around it in the case of the shetlands ) . 
  our eez in the north sea would be much smaller without those islands !, 
  norway has kinda hit the land jackpot . 
  massive oil/gas reserves ( compared to their population size ) & easily available renewables . 
  does n't most of it go to the uk ? 
  edit : seems most of it goes to [ uk/germany ] ( http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/norway/images/natural_gas_exports.png ) , it 's the oil that mostly [ goes to the uk ] ( http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/norway/images/crude_oil_exports.png ) . 
  germany probably gets all their oil from russia . 
  most of the immigrants are eu ( 268k ) & non-eu ( 290k ) nationals , uk citizens returning here were only 83k in 2014 . 
  emigrants are mostly uk nationals ( 139k , so a net loss ) followed by non-eu ( 94k ) and eu ( 91k ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_404613.pdf ), 
  the immigration figures most definitely [ do include british citizens . 
  because not all young people can find work . 
  agreed in many ways i actually trust brussels more than our fucking conservative party . 
  sure but not the working condition . 
  so unless the residency condition is enough . 
  how would that work with young uk citizens though , surely they would n't be able to claim anything ? 
  it will be interesting to see if switzerland can get away with staying in the common market but [ ditching free movement of workers . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_immigration_referendum,_february_2014 ), 
  perhaps a french person can correct me , but to my knowledge both france & germany [ have issues with foreigners claiming benefits ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2fdc67f0-575f-11e3-9624-00144feabdc0.html ) . 
  i would think all the western countries have this problem , it seems like a pretty sensible change to me ? 
  that 's exactly how most people vote man !, 
  i do find it amusing people are politicizing what otherwise is quite a cool post about how you vote in switzerland . 
  i found it interesting !, 
  cheers !, 
  it 's just going back to how it used to be pre 19th century when chinese/indian gdp vastly outstripped the eu & us . 
  the non western powers are now catching up in technology & expertise to become on par with the west as they were before the industrial revolution . 
  why do we need to stay relevant and what does that even mean anyway ? 
  that we have a big military ? 
  why can we not just leave the past behind us and accept that we are not the major powers we used to be . 
  but that does n't mean your citizens can not be successful , some of the most successful countries in the world are also the smallest . 
  holy shit that map is incredible . 
  haha true that , sorry i got them mixed up ( tahir/taksim that is , did n't see istanbul in the title when i first commented ) . 
  still , worth a watch !, 
  those interested in the egyptian protests should watch [ the square ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2486682/ ) , an academy award nominated documentary that covers the protests from 2011 to 2012/13 . 
  it 's also available on netflix in most countries . 
  yea but it 's one of the main reasons people want to leave the eu . 
  however if we were to leave the eu we 'd want to join efta & the eea which would likely mean free movement of people again . 
  let 's just say eu opponents will be looking carefully at [ what happens in switzerland over the coming years . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_immigration_referendum,_february_2014 ), 
  switzerland is still within the common market , we would not be if we left the eu . 
  equally if we wanted to rejoin the common market but not the eu we 'd have to sign up to free movement if people and all the other red tape people ` hate ' so leaving would have been pointless . 
  funny , i used to work for mcdonalds and we would have this guy hang around outside saying he 's poor and homeless and would people please buy him food . 
  once they did he 'd then try to sell the food to passers by . 
  i saw a lot of people get tricked by this , kinda sad really . 
  ah good point yea . 
  i guess they could use uavs for most missions though eg libya , iraq , afghanistan . 
   taranis project wow that looks pretty cool , i wonder if we 'll have any manned aircraft left in 20 years ... would n't these kinds of aircraft be much more maneuverable due to the pilots not being under any g forces ? 
  ha , [ that 's hilarious ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150101/refugees-protest-rural-sweden-re-location ) . 
  how ungrateful can you be : saved from a warzone & given shelter in a safe friendly country & they protest ??? 
  i would agree with this , but i 'm not sure how it would work in terms of the eu parliament . 
  we already have this problem with scotland voting on english laws , and the situation in the eu is far worse with states having essentially veto power over many decisions . 
  anyone have any comments on this ? 
  damn depressing my country is only ranked 19 , although not really surprising to be honest . 
  looking at previous years results it changes a lot year on year , in [ 2013 we were 8th for instance . 
  ] ( http://www3.weforum.org/docs/wef_humancapitalreport_2013.pdf ) i do find it strange that poorer countries can score so high though . 
  countries like lithuania or estonia must have much less money to spend than the other top countries on a per capita basis . 
  i think the eu is fine as it is at the moment . 
  i think those within the single currency may have to make some changes but that is not an issue for the uk to decide . 
  i do think we have some problems with taxation ( some states have much lower levels of tax ) but i am not sure how we can solve this problem , i do n't think it is right for us to tell other countries what levels of tax they should have . 
  this is cool , i 've always liked / u/dclauzel 's french/english double writings . 
  nice to see some welsh too !, 
  cameron is n't trying to get rid of the freedom of movement , it 's obvious that is non negotiable . 
  i do n't remember merkel ever suggesting welfare reform was a red line issue & i do n't see how these issues have somehow disappeared since 2013 . 
  i mean here is [ another report from 2014 ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20140805/foreigners-should-not-get-same-benefits-as-french ) . 
  i think many taxpayers would rather just let greece fail ( i 'm not one of those btw ) in which case we would n't have had to pony up the money . 
  i do n't think things will change in this regard but this bailout is something a lot of people have issues with . 
  it 's obvious not everyone wants a closer eu , all the major economies have eurosceptic parties that want to leave the eu entirely . 
  there are people all over europe that would be scared by this , just look at the issues in getting lisbon ratified . 
  [ it 's an issue for eu migrants as well . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2fdc67f0-575f-11e3-9624-00144feabdc0.html ) [ not true . 
  ] ( http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2132467/uk-contribute-billions-euro-bailout-fund-says-imfs-lagarde.html ) what do you mean no one raised that issue ? 
  [ many countries have opt outs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union ) within the eu pertaining to many different issues . 
  well france has the same problems with regards to welfare & immigration benefits , this has been an issue there for a long time . 
  the whole issue of the debt crisis is problematic for the uk because uk tax payers do n't think they should be bailing out failing european economies especially as we 're not even in the currency union . 
  this is problematic for most of western europe , especially in germany many people are not happy about this . 
  many countries would like opt outs for future integration too ( you can see this by the amount of opt outs they already have & the issues affecting them ) . 
  i think it 's silly to believe all eu countries want to integrate to the same extent . 
  more opt outs to periphery members will allow further integration to those states that want it . 
  i would prefer a larger eu for stability reasons but a multi tiered system is the only way to make this work . 
  we 're not , just like no one is obligated to help britain if the falklands were attacked - it 's outside the remit of the nato treaty . 
  same for almost all our dependencies . 
  agreed , they 're in the news at the moment but they 're hardly things most people care about . 
  i would say the key issues are those covered in the election : - nhs spending - eu referendum ( and issues surrounding that ie free movement of people ) - welfare cuts / spending - taxes ( too high / too low depending on who you ask ) - house prices / social housing / rent prices ( london mainly ) - education policy / free childcare - trident - nationalism ( scotland & english votes in commons ), 
  i do n't know , the issues britain have are n't only our issues . 
  many countries have these problems & i do n't see why we ca n't work at reforming the system . 
  i think if everything just gets denied it 's going to cause quite a lot of resentment here . 
  the eu needs to work for the citizens inside it otherwise what 's the point . 
  no , we just do n't believe mercilessly cutting the government budget while giving tax cuts at the same time is the best way to reduce the deficit ... 
  they 'll do even better after the ecb qe programme inflates the stock market & increases the value of assets . 
  very little of that money will end up in the hands of the average citizen .
