  furthermore deportation costs for those that do n't want to leave , in the uk , were estimated to be # 11000 per applicant . 
  these processing centers located outside the eu ca n't come soon enough really , this system just is n't working . 
  lot of competition with czech girls , probably the largest concentration of hot pornstars anywhere . 
  caprice is a nice call though i agree . 
  thanks , i checked your thread [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/comments/3lbqw2/new_data_frequency_of_posts_by_farright_users_on/ ) as well . 
  it seems the frequency of posters increased quite a lot since / r/europe became default , then increased massively during august after the megathreads were removed . 
  my guess is there was a lot of talk surrounding the topic & `` censorship '' on other subreddits around this time , then when the megathreads were removed all these people decided to come into / r/europe . 
  indeed , please do . 
  post [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta ) and/or message the moderators . 
  this is n't the place to whine about censorship . 
  [ putin offered to get rid of assad in 2012 . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/west-ignored-russian-offer-in-2012-to-have-syrias-assad-step-aside ) the west ignored the offer . 
  note that you 're ignoring cap transfers to romania that account for around 44 % of the money romania receives from the eu . 
  they received 2.5 billion euros in 2013 for farming subsidies for instance . 
  it 's intriguing hearing arguments for eastern europe to leave the eu , from a uk perspective that would probably keep us inside , as people 's issue is by far immigration over everything else . 
  plan a seems to make more sense , they should go back to that . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  it 's no wonder they all leave . 
  why are there so few jobs ? 
  haha this is a good one . 
  this is around twice the amount it costs to host them in lebanon for reference . 
  yea it 's just typical conservative arguments , we have the exact same scenario in the uk . 
  more i was just attacking how utterly ridiculous this stance is in a country like finland . 
  i can sort of understand the rhetoric for countries such as greece where they have little options but in finland that 's not true at all . 
  really this financial crisis was christmas for all conservatives around europe i guess . 
  the article talks about cuts to pay , plus cuts to sick leave & overtime pay which is also related to overall pay . 
  perhaps not forever but they could certainly keep spending like this for decades with no huge problems . 
  it is n't widespread was my point , there are some employers that offer good holidays & sick leave to low paid workers but the majority do n't . 
  also this article is n't about a private company it 's about the government trialing something which is the opposite of the free market . 
  you do n't make cuts during a recession , that 's just stupid , it 's going to make your recession worse . 
  this is especially the case when finnish government spending is 60 % of their economy . 
  their budget deficit is also tiny & nothing to be scared of if their economy was growing . 
  why is the government even cutting spending . 
  your budget deficit is tiny , your debt to gdp is tiny compared to other eu states , and you 're currently in recession . 
  does the government think that cutting people 's wages is going to help that situation ? 
  if anything your country needs stimulus not more fiscal contraction in a country where government spending is 60 % of your economy , this is just bizarre . 
  report & move on, 
  i think it 's the same everywhere , it 's that massive baby boomer generation after the second world war . 
  they were n't savers like their parents so they rely a lot on the government in their old age & because they 're the largest voting bloc they get it . 
  i do n't know how the west is going to deal with this problem though , it 's only going to get worse . 
  i guess people are going to have to work much longer until retirement . 
  the one saving grace in all of this is technological change though . 
  we 'll probably live much better lives in our old age purely due to the technology created in the coming decades , even if there is less money available to pay for it . 
  taxes here are ok . 
  i do n't really have a huge issue with direct taxes , but more on indirect taxes that just hurt the little guy more than anyone . 
  someone in the bottom 20 % of earners pays 28 % of their income in indirect taxes ( 10 % direct ) , that to me just seems crazy , especially when the person in the top 20 % pay just 11 % of their income in indirect taxes ( 24 % direct ) . 
  vat is just way way too high , and we even have a fair few things that are zero rated unlike other eu countries ( this is illegal now ) . 
  do you also have the black hole that is publicly funded pensions for everyone ? 
  the scheme that keeps causing the government to increase taxes & will forever cause them to increase taxes as our population ages . 
  these people paid < 10 % national insurance taxes for their pensions ( the rate was 6.5 % in the 70s slowly increasing to 9 % in the 80s to 10 % in the 90s ) now being funded by  10 % ni ( currently 12 % ) . 
  even with the pension age increasing to 67 [ this is where the government ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/8f402b3256d69ff8e4d48863bc1c526b.png ) projects the break even tax rate is for the programme . 
  yet they have the gall to tell us that free university education is unaffordable apparently , despite it being free when they were growing up . 
  [ this is what will happen ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/c58404cbd619b0c659064761207283d9.png ) to the fund if they do n't increase taxes . 
  we have the same problem in the uk . 
  economists keep saying we should be investing more in infrastructure while borrowing costs are low & what does the government do ? 
  exactly the opposite , they 're already backtracking on previous infrastructure commitments . 
  i think there needs to be certain protections in place to stop people working excessive hours yea , the wtd is kinda there to do that . 
  but no , i would n't support forcing everyone to only work 6 hours a day , that seems a little excessive to me & beyond the norm . 
  but who knows perhaps in a few decades we 'll decide that 's a good policy too . 
  as i said , many low paid employees do n't have bargaining power , so even if they wanted more holiday leave but lower pay they could n't get it . 
  america is very cutthroat , the more you earn the more bargaining power you have & the greater benefits you subsequently receive . 
  policy is much more top down than it is in europe ( ie policy to benefit the few over the many ) . 
  the argument could be made that some policies are inherently in the public good from a health & safety perspective , i 'd put sick leave in that category . 
  even if it means greater costs it 's worth it purely due to public welfare . 
  the problem is , if you leave it up to the market it just does n't happen . 
  as you see in america with holidays , sick , & maternity leave for example . 
  most workers do n't have bargaining power in an environment where there are n't limitations on labour . 
  this is why the government needs to come in sometimes & mandate policy by deciding on an acceptable minimum all companies must agree to , if it 's decided this is in the public good . 
  this looks amazing , it reminds me of the lake district in the uk !, 
  the numbers from kosovo [ increased massively ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/91e5457f01b0f5c2e40fcb1bf1ffc3c5.png ) towards the end of 2014 / start of 2015 . 
  refugees from syria have always numbered around [ 20-30 % of the total since 2013 . 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/6717f9b1d6f680e2ca565f99276a59fb.png ) i 'm not sure what happened at the end of 2014 to cause such a huge increase in numbers coming from kosovo . 
  ukip did pretty well too , i do n't think aid is at all a winning policy . 
  while both labour & the conservatives support the idea it 's not going to be a huge voting issue however . 
  as i said it 's suppose to stop major conflict between the major powers & it 's been pretty effective at that . 
  if states just ignore the unsc you 're going to get a lot more proxy wars . 
  they 're looking to encroach on another countries soil without their approval . 
  that is why they 're looking for un approval . 
  the only times doing this is legal under international law iirc is either with a un resolution or when directly defending your country from an imminent threat . 
  read the article , they do n't want the west to use this as a justification for action in libya and/or syria . 
  they would be right to question this given past actions . 
  it 's not legal without a un resolution . 
  the unsc is there to promote discussion and diplomacy between the major powers and stop large conflict between them . 
  veto power is pretty crucial to that purpose . 
  that 's the case with all areas of law though surely ? 
  i mean only a little over 50 % of asylum cases go on to be successful within the eu for instance ( 2014 ) . 
  perhaps some of the people you 're arguing to receive asylum do n't actually deserve asylum ? 
  i suppose you 're right though , it would n't be as bad as getting a murderer released . 
  he deals with some asylum cases but i believe most of his cases are around people that are wrongfully detained ( people with mental health issues that should n't be in detention ) or mistreated while in detention . 
  it 's definitely not a job that pays the `` big bucks '' but i get the impression that it is very rewarding work . 
  i should imagine criminal defense law is similar . 
  my brother is a human rights lawyer , i think i 'll ask him about this next time i see him . 
  i would guess he probably supports the work the echr does though seeing as he spends most of his time working with refugees to sue the government !, 
  ah , yes , i could see that being a problem . 
  even so most countries have plenty of [ english ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/france/ ) language news sources . 
  it 's perhaps true that people from those countries do n't read them however . 
  i 'd like to see more local news on here to be honest . 
  i come here wanting to learn about other european countries & all i read about are migrants & the occasional article about russia . 
  you may be right it 's not really an area i know a great deal about to be honest . 
  well uk courts are probably working on the basis of different standards to the echr , but i could n't argue either way which is more appropriate .
