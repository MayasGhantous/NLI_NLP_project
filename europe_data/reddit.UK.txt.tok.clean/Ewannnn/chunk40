  because the sensor will only actually be open for 1/4000th of a second or shorter depending on your max shutter speed . 
  it probably will be damaged , aiming a camera at the sun for any length of time is a really bad idea . 
  the exception here is a dslr ( as long as you 're not in liveview ) but you 'll be aiming blind ( as you ca n't put your eye through the viewfinder ) & the image might not come out very good without a strong nd filter . 
  still , better than nothing & what i plan on doing !, 
  i suppose it 's quite an outdated term now yes, 
  it 's sad yes & do n't mistake me i am not condoning what putin has done whatsoever but this is the reality of the situation . 
  to be fair military escalation on the front of the eu would also result in military escalation on the front of russia . 
  you ca n't solve a problem like this by massing troops in eastern bloc countries , doing so would be incredibly dangerous for peace in europe . 
  partly the reason we 're in this situation to begin with is because of our expansionist practices in eastern europe . 
  ok you can say perhaps ukraine wants closer ties with the eu , but you have to see this from russia 's point of view & realise there are consequences for trying to interfere in their sphere of influence . 
  any sort of deals to be made in this area _ have _ to be done in conjunction with russian support or you will just have disaster ( as we are seeing now ) . 
  also let 's not kid ourselves and think we are not incredibly reliant upon russia in europe . 
  it 's fine for americans to sit back & suggest we should be using harsher measures but at the end of the day russia is in our backyard not theirs & it 's our economies that will suffer if sanctions have to be increased . 
  heh i am just reading about this now . 
  you 'd think with the issues our politicians have at the moment wrt the eu , more states in the eu would be the last thing they 'd want . 
  do n't be surprised if our government is more hostile after the general election though !, 
  i think he 's making a fair point & just avoiding the issue does n't make it go away . 
  kids watch porn , it 's as simple as that , and it is important for them to realise the differences between sex in porn & sex in real life . 
  i 'm only 26 so i doubt it has changed that much , but i do n't remember learning * anything * about sex in school . 
  the sex education was a complete and utter joke . 
  i remember being given some leaflets that i was suppose to read but of course at that age i did n't care about reading a few panthlets . 
  perhaps i was shown once how to put on a condom but that 's about it . 
  it 's about body image as well . 
  i have a younger sister ( 15 ) who suffers from this a lot . 
  how you need to be skinny , you need to have good teeth , you need you have a flat stomach the list goes on . 
  porn is * terrible * at creating this view that everyone needs to be perfect & anything less is unacceptable . 
  kids these days suffer horrible insecurities surrounding image & i wish we would discuss it more . 
  we 're constantly taking selfies , sharing pictures on social media & how we look is more central than ever . 
  not only general characteristics but that of our sexual organs as well & general grooming . 
  how every vagina should look like those you see in porn ( hint , they do n't ) . 
  how it should be expected everyone should be well groomed downstairs . 
  that is n't something you expect from someone it 's something you discuss with them but it is their choice at the end of the day . 
  how every dick should be 7 '' ( hint , they 're not ) & circumcised ( most men in porn are circumcised at least in my experience ) . 
  kids need to realise this is n't normal , otherwise they 're going to look at themselves or their partners and think `` well there must be something wrong with him/her '' . 
  finally , kids need to realise that looking at porn is n't wrong & masterbating is n't shameful . 
  it 's healthy to be curious about your sexuality & to want to experiment but it 's important to realise there are differences between what you see in porn & how you should treat people in real life . 
  it 's important to realise that sex is a two way street & it 's not just about your enjoyment but about your partners just as much . 
  i make this point because porn often emphasizes male enjoyment at the expense of women & that undoubtedly gets transferred to the real world . 
  so yes , i think especially in britain we really are n't good when it comes to talking about sex & sex related issues . 
  it 's something everyone does & it 's critical we talk about it in a responsible fashion . 
  [ i was reading an article recently that was commenting that in a war on foreign soil even the uk was more capable than china . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/why-britains-military-could-beat-china-2014-1?ir=t ) pointless hypertheticals as ever , but also note that china & russia have a fair amount of disputed territory as well . 
  china is no real friend of russia for sure , you 're right about both countries having no real allies . 
  indeed , like in the other thread people were talking about the rumour of russia withdrawing their diplomats from their embassy in the uk & how that may mean they are close to declaring war . 
  perhaps even the uk assassinated putin . 
  seriously , where do people get these ridiculous ideas ? 
  well remember the parliament is only one half of the legislative branch , there is the council of ministers as well which all states get 1 seat on regardless of size . 
  indeed & germany has a way way way bigger stake in reducing / not increasing sanctions . 
  germany accounted for 14 % of russian imports in 2012 while the uk only 2.5 % . 
  not to mention russia is absolutely vital to german industry since that is where they get the vast majority of their raw materials & energy products ( oil/gas ) . 
  continental europe is far more reliant on this than the uk who gets most of their oil from the north sea ( norway ) . 
  all this does mean that germany is much more likely to succeed in negotiations than any other nation though . 
  but the outcome of those negotiations may not be best for ukraine . 
  those taxes are _ really _ brutal . 
  you have no nontaxable income at all ? 
  i hope your minimum wage is really large otherwise it must be difficult to survive on low wages ... 
  [ this is what they said in the report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_anx_en.pdf ) `` in each of the selected sampling points , a starting address was drawn , at random . 
  further addresses ( every nth address ) were selected by standard `` random route '' procedures , from the initial address . 
  in each household , the respondent was drawn , at random ( following the `` closest birthday rule '' ) . 
  all interviews were conducted face-to-face in people 's homes and in the appropriate national language . '', 
  so i think if this is n't representative perhaps people do just tend to exaggerate a lot , after all this was a survey not a language test . 
   eurobarometer 386 [ report summary ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_sum_en.pdf ) [ how the report was carried out ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_anx_en.pdf ), 
  for me i only say this when they go into a country without the support of a legitimate government . 
  if you have a country with a legitimate government asking america for help i would praise them , but when they decide to poke their nose where it 's not wanted i have some concerns . 
  if the government is illegitimate & wants american help similarly i have concerns because this means the people do n't necessarily support the action either . 
  we say lat via, 
  even their largest city is named after an english person !, 
  it 's not the being defensive that is the issue it 's the downvote brigading that goes on . 
  on europe & a few other related subs you will actually get upvoted for criticizing other countries whether said in jest or not . 
  what 's worse is the americans seem to even pollute this sub , getting downvoted for criticizing them here as well . 
  as far as accepting criticism and not mass downvoting we are really great about that in europe in * most * cases . 
  there are a few exceptions , for example anything to do with russia , but i think that 's because most of those comments * are * garbage . 
  i think we are a lot more socially liberal , you can see that when anything to do with police/crime/prisons / health care comes up . 
  i also think we have very very different views when it comes to military & military spending . 
  the average reddit user probably thinks they spend too much in america but they would n't support anything on the level we in europe spend . 
  they also would n't support the same level of welfare spending we have or the same level of taxes . 
  to be honest i can totally understanding sitting , it really does make a lot of sense at home . 
  but fuck if i am sitting in public toilets !, 
  so basically you want to discuss world news with people that ... * arent * american ? 
  way to hang your comrades out to dry buddy !, 
  haha ^ i ^ can ^ understand ^ your ^ frustration, 
  did n't they also concede that there is currently no mechanism to remove a country from the eu & creating such a mechanism would be impossible due to individual countries veto power ? 
  country arms exportation is really small business , even uk/france make very little money from it . 
  private defense contractors do make a lot of money but they 're primarily from the uk/france . 
  if we were to have a unified army i would think those companies would get most of the contracts because they already have the expertise & infrastructure needed ( bae systems , thales , airbus ) . 
  well they were colonies , we do share some of the blame for them being shitholes . 
  but yes , little we can do about it now , it is in the past . 
  you push people too far in one direction and you will get secession and instability . 
  this kind of issue will need to be handled very slowly with support of all the primary players including uk , france , germany . 
  there is literally no way the uk would agree to something like this for many decades . 
  just not going to happen . 
  eu nations are still very independent i do n't see the larger eu nations giving up foreign policy decisions to brussels any time soon . 
  you wo n't see support for this in france or germany either as you pointed out . 
  i think you could get uk to contribute troops to a defensive force as long as they remained uk troops . 
  but anything that would undermine our ability to have an independent army is a no go . 
  we could even develop joint equipment by contributing to a joint research fund ( as we already do with some nato products for instance ) but again purchases would have to be for independent states and not some eu army . 
  i 've been on this subreddit for a while & i 've seen people go back & forth on this issue . 
  as far as i can tell you can find statistics to support both points of view from reliable sources so it is quite difficult to judge . 
  as an example , this report puts usa # 1 in household wealth , but then you look at [ this credit suisse report ] ( https://www.credit-suisse.com/upload/news-live/000000022801.pdf ) which paints a much different picture of the wealth of the average american . 
  then you have mean household income , median household income , mean adult income , median adult income , all of these statistics will paint different pictures .
