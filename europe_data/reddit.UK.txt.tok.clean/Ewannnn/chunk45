  it 's just low paid part time workers and unemployed bringing down the average due to the personal allowance . 
  in denmark like the uk you have a personal allowance where you do n't pay any income tax at all . 
  really surprised the uk is so low down on this list , even below the us ... 
  i guess we have more indirect taxes than them mind you . 
  this is the average tax rate not the marginal rate . 
  so for instance with the additional 15 % , this would only be the case for income above dkk 422,000 . 
  you also have tax free allowance too . 
  so for instance in the uk ( 2013 figures , so different but close to op ) the top marginal income tax rate is 45 % , yet the average tax rate paid in the uk was 13.24 % . 
  even the top 10 % of the population in terms of income only paid 19.67 % tax here . 
  we have tax bands of 20 % , 40 % and 45 % here , with 20 % being paid after ~ # 10k , 40 % after ~ # 45k , 45 % after # 120k . 
  i do n't know , i think it 's more likely the eu breaks up if the uk leaves successfully . 
  there 's also the real estimated negative growth effect of brexit on the eurozone , which is bound to affect the global economy in some way although it 's not a huge risk like the break up is . 
  i think you misunderstand my post , i 'm not saying the uk specifically leaving will have global implications . 
  i 'm saying it will have implications for the eu , which may have global implications . 
  the uk is just one domino piece as it were in a catastrophe waiting to happen . 
  i believe the global impact is more how it will affect europe . 
  slower growth in europe due to brexit , or even potentially more referenda , could most definitely have vast global implications . 
  why exactly ? 
  [ because their deficit as an independent nation would be twice as large as the uk deficit . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon/12190408/nicola-sturgeon-in-denial-over-scotlands-deficit-and-independence.html ) people during the campaign suggested that relying so heavily on something as volatile as oil was potentially bad news , but were shrugged off as `` anti-scottish '' . 
  similar to how people pointing out potential negative impacts from brexit are characterised as `` not trusting in britain '' . 
  this is the issue with blind nationalism really , you can shrug off perfectly legitimate criticisms as simply being scaremongering and anti-british . 
  but the severity is vastly different . 
  i guess massive austerity brought about by huge budget deficits is not to be feared . 
  my guess is eventually sweden will have to adjust their economy to accommodate these new migrants . 
  when they do so it will be fine . 
  domestic citizens may lose out somewhat , but it wo n't be the end of the world and the economy will probably do better overall . 
  quotas make sense inside schengen . 
  if states do n't want to participate they should be free to leave though . 
  they should also decide on border controls collectively too . 
  turkey houses and feeds very few of the refugees , many of them work illegally because they have no other choice . 
  only around 10 % of those syrians in turkey are actually resident in the camps provided by the state . 
  this has always been what the refugee status is about , it 's enshrined in the refugee convention . 
  the purpose of this status has never changed , as there was no such status prior to this treaty . 
  also sometimes these conflicts go on for a long time , there are people that have lived in refugee camps in africa for decades . 
  it does n't make sense for them or the country housing them to keep them there . 
  turkey retained the right to maintain the geographical restrictions from the 1951 protocol making it functionally unenforceable . 
  the geographic restrictions mean the protocol only applies to refugees in the region of europe , where these days there are no refugees . 
  they 're the only original signatory that did this . 
  and users on here wonder why these people do n't want to stay in turkey ... 
  [ we have banned people in the past from coming here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_banned_from_entering_the_united_kingdom ) i do n't know if we still do so , one would presume that we do . 
  edit : [ i believe this is the relevant eu law ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_2.1.3.html ) : `` restrictions on the right of entry and the right of residence on grounds of public policy , public security or public health : union citizens or members of their family may be expelled from the host member state on grounds of public policy , public security or public health . 
  under no circumstances may an expulsion decision be taken on economic grounds . 
  measures affecting freedom of movement and residence must comply with the proportionality principle and be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned . 
  such conduct must represent a sufficiently serious and present threat affecting the fundamental interests of the state . 
  previous criminal convictions do not automatically justify expulsion . 
  the mere fact that the entry documents used by the individual concerned have expired does not constitute grounds for such a measure . 
  only in exceptional circumstances , for overriding considerations of public security , can expulsion orders be served on a union citizen if he/she has resided in the host country for ten years or if he/she is a minor . 
  lifelong exclusion orders may not be issued under any circumstances and persons concerned by exclusion orders may apply for a review after three years . 
  they also have access to judicial review and , where relevant , administrative review in the host member state . '', 
  [ a dutch mp was banned from the uk in 2009 for this reason  ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7885918.stm ) `` the home office said there was a blanket ban on mr wilders entering the uk ** under eu laws enabling member states to exclude someone whose presence could threaten public security . 
  i think he means you 'll have to register before coming like with the us visa waiver system . 
  not sure why we would do this with eu countries when we do n't do it with anyone else mind you . 
  sweden , like many european countries has a very restrictive labour market that makes it hard for foreigners whether refugees , european immigrants or immigrants from outside to find work . 
  i believe there is talk of introducing a reduced minimum wage to help with the issue . 
  eurostat has data on this [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/mobile/index.php#page?title=migrant_integration_statistics_-_employment&amp;lg=en ), 
  the swedish labour market is a big barrier to entry . 
  [ they do n't have the same issues finding work in the uk for instance . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/mobile/index.php#page?title=migrant_integration_statistics_-_employment&amp;lg=en ) it 's not just refugees that struggle to find work in sweden either it 's all immigrants including those from the eu . 
  eurozone countries will be the only ones in the inner circle out of necessity . 
  not for many decades i would think , too many differences between countries . 
  none of those countries are in the emu , so they do n't need to be inside any fiscal union . 
  there are probably sentencing guidelines online you can read about specific crimes and how sentences are decided . 
  for instance in the uk we have the [ cps guidelines ] ( http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/ ) and [ sentencing council ] ( http://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/publications/?type=publications&amp;cat=definitive-guideline&amp;s&amp;topic= ) , the latter especially has very detailed analysis of why certain sentences are given . 
  ok it looks much better now than before , even though the changes are minor . 
  there 's just one glaring issue that remains for me at least , and that is the colour contrast . 
  the titles are white , the comment buttons are white , the usernames are white , the time submitted is white , everything is white . 
  the consequence is that it is difficult to differentiate quickly between relevant information . 
  it would be much better if the only thing that was bright white was the title , and everything else is shaded different . 
  it 's not wrong , hdi is just not the best measure of how good a place is to live . 
  all western democracies are basically the same in terms of income , stuff like weather and culture is far more important . 
  the us has a good case to argue on that front , having such a varied climate . 
  if you 're not poor it 's a pretty good place to live to be honest . 
  it 's a shitty argument anyway , barely any of a country 's tax money actually gets spent on infrastructure . 
  sweden has much higher income taxes . 
  you pay 31 % on anything between $ 2700 and $ 62,000 , 51 % between $ 62,000 and 88,000 , 56 % on income above $ 88,000 . 
  capital gains taxes are similar , in the us it is 28 % and in sweden it is 30 % . 
  sales taxes are much larger , 25 % on most stuff except food ( and a few other minor stuff ) which is taxed at 12 % . 
  you also have 32 % mandatory social security contributions , as well as 7 % pension tax . 
  any swede earning money is getting taxed on 50 % + of their income . 
  are they actually exempt ? 
  i do n't believe so . 
  the issue is campaign finance is n't capped yet as it is n't the official campaign session yet . 
  do n't purdah rules prevent them from even being involved during the official election period too ? 
  people are predisposed to prefer reading negative news , so if you can portray something as negative you 're more likely to get hits . 
  you expect balanced opinion on a website called corporateeurope.org lol ?? 
  [ on average people in work without kids will essentially gain nothing from conservative policy changes over the next parliament . 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/3543a244e0df31cd4a3a3d7ec6340928.png ) people with kids will all lose out , whether they 're in work or not , on average . 
  likely to see a cdu/fdp coalition in the future ? 
  they 're more politically aligned than cdu/spd i would think . 
  sounds like little to worry about . 
  they 're lucky the spd has been losing too though , if they had n't this would be very worrying for them . 
  the conservatives really need to sort this out , it 's a big problem . 
  osborne has said the current account deficit is a priority but it does n't seem to be getting any smaller . 
  i suppose his control over this is quite limited however . 
  charles has lizard blood in him ? 
  thanks , if the numbers are that different to the credit suisse report ( a much more trusted institution ) then it sounds totally bogus to me . 
  europe ( especially germany ) relies a lot more on russia for trade and energy . 
  the uk on the other hand does not , so we tend to take a more hardline stance .
