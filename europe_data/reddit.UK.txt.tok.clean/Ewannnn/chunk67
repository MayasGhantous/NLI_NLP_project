  a government elected by a minority ( and a small one at that ) imposing their policies on everyone else . 
  that 's why ultimate parliamentary sovereignty can be pretty bad news for everyone else . 
  the uk parliamentary system does n't work by majority , it is tyranny of the minority . 
  historically a party has only even got more than 50 % of the vote once in the last 100 years . 
  so is this overblown ? 
  it will only allow reunification in limited circumstances ? 
  christ , why would anyone want to investment in such a corrupt shit country . 
  indeed , talk about hyperbole . 
  westerners always seem to blow things out of proportion . 
  if we want to talk about a state stretched to the limit look at somewhere like lebanon or jordan , germany will be totally fine . 
  goldman sachs is understandable i guess but the vatican ? 
  i do n't think there has been any suggestion of us giving up the land , only some unused territory as you say . 
  the details will probably be the same as in the annan plan which anastasiades supported . 
  i do n't think that 's really politically incorrect . 
  it would be politically incorrect to then start saying we must ban homosexual acts and other such nonsense . 
  people on / r/ukpolitics seem to think the same . 
  politics has gone so far right wing in the uk in recent decades . 
  lol the greek islands are tiny , no way they can keep a million people on them . 
  supply would be a nightmare and there literally would n't be enough space unless you want to turn them into prison islands which is ridiculous and illegal . 
  belgium tried to deport refugees back to greece in 2011 and was fined by the ecthr for doing so since it was judged that the infrastructure in greece was inadequate . 
  after this ruling most eu countries suspended dublin ii in the case of greece and continue to do so even now . 
  most countries in the eu had already suspended dublin ii rules in the case of greece since 2011 . 
  lol dude , merkel suspended dublin at the end of august , by which point some [ ~ 850,000 ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/e0ca3a20ec3d3ebe07266204ed37cd5c.png ) people had already crossed illegally into europe . 
  furthermore dublin ii had already been suspended for migrants entering via greece ** since 2011 ** in germany , uk , belgium , france and other countries due to greece 's lack of proper infrastructure to house the refugees . 
  belgium was actually fined in 2011 for deporting some asylum seekers back to greece via dublin ii . 
  this whole merkel is the devil meme is just scapegoating for inadequacies in the eu-wide asylum system . 
  this is n't merkel 's fault alone it is the fault of all schengen members . 
  does the fact that large hedge funds are supporting brexit suggest that 's bad too ? 
  do we tally up all the supporters and then decide based on that instead of the actual arguments for staying/leaving ? 
  they just want to nationalise some natural monopolies indeed , which in many european countries are already de facto nationalised anyway . 
  even this they can not do because it 's too expensive , due to decades of privatization by the right in the uk . 
  they want to create a nationalized development bank , but the nordics and germany already have one of those . 
  corbyn believes in nationalizing the banks , important industries , and stopping funding for the military ? 
  do you have a quote ? 
  do i need to point out that germany already has a national development bank ( a corbyn policy ) , they already spend less on the military , and they already have far more nationalised industry than we do . 
  indeed , afd winning elections is a total joke , they will be lucky to get any seats at all . 
  wow , this really does n't look like the uk at all . 
  probably a case of `` a little more wo n't hurt '' . 
  christ , that library replacement is ugly as hell . 
  the architect that designed it should consider a different career ... 
  british take on modern architecture , we have a lot of shit buildings like that here . 
  we can blame the nazi 's for coventry . 
  the city was [ flattened during ww2 .

  norway has one of the highest growth rates in western europe . 
  q3 growth was 1.8 % compared to a euro average of 0.3 % . 
  [ google street view ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@44.3894246,26.0774337,3a,75y,303.5h,75.59t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1socgdozoouknq2hmdojkr2a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) for anyone that wants to look around . 
  it seems to be only a very small area that looks really bad . 
  we are ? 
  has your quality of life got noticeably worse in the last few years due to immigration ? 
  if so please explain how . 
  there are loads of low skilled jobs syrians or other refugees can do . 
  not every native has a good education you know ? 
  surely the opposite happens and joining the eu causes more capital inflow to poorer countries since potential growth is higher there . 
  the thing is , we have a veto on major change within the eu , and a guarantee there will be a referendum on it too . 
  california has a much lower nominal gdp than england . 
  seems 2013 gdp in california was $ 2.2 trillion while for england back in 2009 it was $ 2.7 trillion . 
  the us was n't really a british colony , like australia , canada and nz they were just extensions of britain populated by the british . 
  point of no return ? 
  france will be fine , their borrowing costs are tiny , around 0.5 % at the moment . 
  furthermore the imf is projecting their debt to gdp will reach a maximum in 2016 of 98 % and reduce to 93 % by 2020 . 
  you can see all the data [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=64&amp;pr.y=15&amp;sy=2013&amp;ey=2020&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=132&amp;s=ggr_ngdp%2cggx_ngdp%2cggxcnl_ngdp%2cggsb_npgdp%2cggxonlb_ngdp%2cggxwdn_ngdp%2cggxwdg_ngdp&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) of course this may end up being wrong to a certain extent , but i think the issues of debt are rather overblown to be honest . 
  far more important are the issues around unemployment and growth rather than debt , neither of which are improving at a very good rate ( imf project growth of 1.5 % in 2016 , 1.6 % 2017 , 1.7 % 2018 , 1.9 % 2019 1.9 % 2020 ; unemployment will fall to 9 % by 2020 ) . 
  they talked about the potential for interference in the nbp in their report , you can read it [ here . 
  ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnx7a0eeelf0n2gkzymahesrqr6ihwtod2noxmn5pvu/pub ), 
  they were also worried about the precedent set by recent changes made and the potential for political interference in the national bank of poland ( their central bank ) . 
  this political interference could potentially have huge ramifications for the polish bond market . 
  now it 's your turn for a citation . 
   [ citation needed ] [ sure . 
  ] ( http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/effect-of-discretionary-policy-on-gdp-growth-final.pdf )  cutting government spending , which means more money in the pockets of citizens , which means more money available for creating jobs is ludicrous ? 
  actually it does n't mean that , it just means less borrowing by the government and less money in the economy . 
  this depressed the economy ( [ hardly surprising when government expenditure is so important for growth ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/bbca59095d1c1aae7d04af4a3c7cdd68.png ) ) and almost pushed us into recession again in 2012 until osborne stopped his push for extreme austerity ( in 2012/13 spending actually went up as a percentage of gdp ) . 
  42 is still terrible , the error range on that would be huge . 
  [ this calculator ] ( http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm ) suggests the confidence interval would be + -15 % ... 
  it 's not a representative sample . 
  you 'd need a poll purely from ni with a sample size of around 1500 . 
  austerity harms growth ( obr estimates say 1 % in 2010/11 and 1 % in 2011/12 ) which obviously means it will harm employment . 
  suggesting it actually helps employment is ludicrous , there is no basis for such an argument . 
  the austerity argument won back in 2010 , because the public do n't really understand economics and explaining that things are like your household budget is easy to understand . 
  so in the end the simplest and most common sense argument won , and thus we arrive at our current economic strategy . 
  blair signed us up to the eu social chapter and instituted the minimum wage .

  going independent would have taken years , the oil price would have fallen before everything had been finalised . 
  it 's north sea oil , any country bordering it has some although it 's mostly owned by the uk / norway .

  this comment section ( on reddit ) seems to be almost exclusively full of people that have only read the title . 
  sigh . 
  the people that want to leave the eu just want a fta , no single market access . 
  can they , really ? 
  do you have a citation ? 
  reading the comments in this thread is depressing , it 's a total shitshow . 
  let the refugees drown they said , shoot the refugees at the border they said , let them starve they said ...

  the free movement that the swiss have issue with is a part of their bilateral treaties with the eu . 
  within the efta there is no free movement of labour with the eu , only with other efta countries as i recall . 
   they dont want to send him check , they want him extradited so they can send him off to us if the us was interested in extradition they would have gone through the uk government .
