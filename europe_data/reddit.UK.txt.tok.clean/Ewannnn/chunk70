  but hey , at least our birth rate is increasing again ( we hit a 25-year high in 2015 ) . 
  you most likely wo n't see growth rates significantly above 2-3 % in the future from our side . 
  eh we have the same problem , although true not to the extent that you have . 
  i think immigration can help a lot though ? 
  i know immigrants in the uk have much higher fertility than native born for instance . 
  i think opening up the borders to international immigration ( not refugees , proper immigrants via visa ) could help a lot and definitely slow the aging process in the short term . 
  in the long term , of course , this will make matters worse but technology will probably change things then anyway ( automation ) . 
   it took us until 2011 to reach the 2000 level . 
  between 2000 and 2005 it has been a constant decline . 
  what do you mean by this ? 
  germany grew a lot between 2000 and 2010 , and will grow a lot between 2010 and 2020 . 
  see [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=48&amp;pr.y=17&amp;sy=2000&amp;ey=2020&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=134&amp;s=ngdp_r%2cngdp_rpch%2cngdp&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ), 
   which is why people are highly critical of further qe . 
  heh well remember you 're in a currency union , it 's not only the german economy that matters :p bond prices could do with being pushed down in other countries and [ ez wide core inflation ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/core-inflation-rate ) is actually substantially lower than in germany ( 1.1 vs 1.43 in oct 2015 , 0.9 % now in ez in december ) . 
   you have to start somewhere no you do n't , i mean what is germany 's nominal growth projection for 2015 ? 
  so they 'd need a deficit below 1.5 % and their debt to gdp would fall . 
  there is no requirement for a budget surplus or balanced budget , that 's only needed if you actually want to reach 0 % debt to gdp and you want to get there asap , i 'm not quite sure why you would want to do this ( well when you realise the greece comparison is ridiculous , as i 'm sure you do , i guess this is the reason they give though ! ) ? 
  no doubt the long run nominal growth will be much higher than 2 % too ( for the uk it would be 4-5 % but do n't have stats for germany on hand ) . 
  as to whether you 're overtaxed or not , of course you are by definition overtaxed if you 're running a surplus . 
  taxes can be cut to balance the budget . 
  you 're also being overtaxed compared to previous generations because they ran budget deficits not surpluses , this is taking money away from the population if it 's going on debt reduction . 
  on wages , yes i agree the situation in germany has n't been nearly as bad as in the uk , but it was still a pretty bad recession as far as things go . 
  i did have a check ( not too familiar with german economic history ) and i could n't find anything similar in the last few decades . 
  there would be real wage growth even with 2 % inflation true , but it would be nowhere near where it is right now ( it would be 0.4 % in q3 2015 yoy ) . 
  western governments ( and consumers ) are pretty blessed by the oil price right now ( as well as other falling commodity prices ) , core inflation is much higher ( 1.43 % in germany and 1.2 % in the uk ) . 
  in that if inflation was at the 2 % target there would be almost no real wage growth in germany . 
  [ this graph ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/30b8c6d112c35814b2f9276b5cc99d3b.png ) should make pretty clear what i mean in the uk case , most of the real wage growth came from the fall in inflation . 
  whose kids are they talking about here , because most peoples kids will be 18 + now or soon , so it will actually be them paying for these higher taxes rather than themselves who are probably retired or will be soon . 
  i mean germany has been in deficit for most of the last 20 years , how is fair to subject the current younger generation to excessive and over taxation while the previous generation has been profligate ? 
  the generation most adversely affected by the worst global recession in decades too . 
  i guess the household budget analogy is used a lot in germany too ? 
  we also get the greece comparisons here . 
  you can thank low inflation for that . 
  same situation in the uk ( well not best in a decade , but best since 2010 ) , again thanks to low inflation !, 
  sure , you 're right in that regard . 
  the latter ( fall of debt to gdp ) would happen even if they had a deficit though . 
  no need for a balanced budget or surplus to cut debt to gdp . 
  i think he means government employees . 
  are there any public sector pay freezes in germany atm ? 
  but yea , as you said this will probably just go on the refugee costs in 2016 . 
  without this extra money they would have cut spending due to their commitment to balance the government budget . 
  where did this balanced budget idea come from btw ? 
  is this kind of policy popular in germany among older voters , is that why it 's proposed ? 
  seems kinda silly from my pov and unfair on younger voters , but i suppose if germans are happy with it ... 
  it 's not going on repaying debts ( which is sensible , using any surplus to pay off debt is idiotic atm ) it 's going on helping the refugees settle and integrate into german society . 
  so i suppose you could say it 's investment in human capital , that will hopefully pay off into the future . 
  unemployable ones sure , but realistically how many of them are there , probably not many . 
  all things being equal probably not no , but costs have to be controlled otherwise it 's just more money taken from the younger generation and what about their quality of life ? 
  in the uk already 40 % of the government budget is spent on services that almost exclusively go to serving those over 65 ( pensions and healthcare ) . 
  the amount of money spent on the older generation is [ ridiculously high . 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/603774bd37b751d28f6da0f9cb7b07e9.png ) it 's not like they saved for this eventuality either , they spent their taxes on benefits for themselves , and now they 're old they expect someone else to pay for it . 
  immigration of low skilled labour are only a burden 40 years from now . 
  in 40 years robots will likely be doing everything and we 'll all have a basic income . 
  to be honest i 'm worried about the dependency ratio here and now , not 40 years from now . 
  you joke , but pension age at least in the uk should have and should be rising far faster than it is . 
  to give an example in 1950 the retirement age for men was 65 but average age of death was 71 . 
  now the retirement age is still 65 but average age of death is 82 . 
  that 's 11 extra years the state , and by extension working age adults , have to pay for . 
  every 6 years at current rates average age of death ( median ) increases by 2 years , yet the retirement age is only increasing by 1 every 6 years ( 66 in 2020 and 67 in 2026 ) . 
  this is totally unsustainable . 
  being outside the ez has a lot of advantages . 
  they can set their own more beneficial interest rates , they can borrow in their own currency ( so no risk of default ) , they do n't share debt with other ez countries . 
  they can also remove the peg if they want to , as switzerland did recently for instance . 
  then they do n't pay for their stay . 
  even prisoners do n't get their property seized to pay for their stay in prison . 
  by all means reduce their state benefits but do n't start stealing their property from them without permission . 
  i guess perhaps they can revoke their refugee status , and thus they will not receive any state support ? 
  not sure that 's the best course of action to put on someone just released from prison mind you . 
  encouraging repeat offense is n't exactly a good idea . 
  after all , keeping them in prison is more expensive than paying them to stay outside prison and behave . 
  a bit of a contradiction there , the refugee status ca n't be voided , if it was there would be no issue with deporting them back to wherever they came from . 
  obviously , if they came from syria say , and their life is at risk if they 're deported then they 're still a refugee . 
  if of course they were granted asylum and their home country is now safe , they could deport them though !, 
  so what , we close borders and have zero immigration through fear that one or two may commit crimes ? 
  do n't be silly . 
  hey now , when i take the poll [ it tells me ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/1c327f70c2c8abc66b75dc3ad805ea61.png ) 100 % think he 's a vile fascist !, 
  yea that 's a fair point , not sure how it relates to them being refugees or not though . 
  they do n't register because then we could deport them back to france ( when they successfully enter the uk ) . 
  of course france could threaten to deport them then they would be forced to do so , but they do n't seem to want to do that . 
  i agree that pacifism is more associated with the hard left , but on most matters sdp is more to the left of labour i think . 
  they 're more similar to corbyn than they are to blair on most issues . 
  i think it 's a case of , being in nato , as well as our `` special relationship '' with america makes us do idiotic things like the iraq war . 
  if we were to distance ourselves there would be less onus on getting involved . 
  for instance , for the most recent vote on bombing in syria the biggest argument made was to `` help our allies '' . 
  britain still likes to be seen as a reliable partner and does n't want to take a backseat . 
  withdrawal from nato would potentially change that in ken 's mind i guess . 
  the issue with this idea is it leaves 100k + people in serbia or greece , neither of which can cope with such large numbers of people . 
  in the case of hungary dublin was suspended by the country itself . 
  in the case of i believe both countries ( greece , hungary ) , but definitely in the case of greece dublin has been suspended for humanitarian reasons . 
  their asylum systems are overloaded and not fit for purpose . 
  states have been fined simply for deporting individuals back to greece since they were judged to be held in inhuman conditions in greece by the ecthr . 
  so although you are right , under dublin ii states can deport individuals back to the first safe country within the eu , in practice this is currently unenforceable . 
  they 're obviously not refugees if they do n't claim to be refugees . 
  but if they do , then they 're protected as refugees and can not be deported back to where they 're fleeing from . 
  basically their story is believed until it is proven to be false . 
  perks of being outside schengen :p, 
  to be honest , i thought hungary was n't processing the refugees the last few months ( as in that the only ones processed were ones that actually wanted to stay there ) but i guess i must be wrong . 
  to be honest this seems like a common occurrence , when you look at [ pending applications ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00190&amp;plugin=1 ) for hungary the numbers just disappear despite many [ claims never being processed . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=migr_asydcfstq&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view ) this is the case going back even to 2014 .
