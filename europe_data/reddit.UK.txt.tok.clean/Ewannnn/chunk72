  edit : [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=migr_asyappctzm&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view ) are the number of actual applications by month in 2015 , but as i said it 's pretty meaningless to our conversation because these applications will not have been processed yet so who knows if they are genuine or not . 
  the stats i linked before , as well as final instance decisions that have n't been released yet as far as i can see , are the only relevant pieces of information . 
  then i guess his estimate is wrong , because that seems contrary to the facts . 
  do you have a finnish statistical office source ? 
  source ? 
  [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/7/73/first_instance_decisions_by_outcome_and_recognition_rates%2c_3rd_quarter_2015.png ) is showing 56 % accepted last quarter and that is just first instance decisions , after appeals ( final instance decisions , no quarterly data only annual not released yet ) it 's going to be much higher than that . 
  * please * , you know full well if it was n't for these people crossing on boats europe would just ignore it entirely and barely accept anyone . 
  people only care when it 's on their doorstep otherwise they live in blissful ignorance . 
  i misread his post , i thought he said the man was from egypt or libya . 
  sealand ? 
  he was from sudan ... 
  it 's our responsibility to police our own borders . 
  permanent residence is as it sounds , permanent . 
  the alternative is to just give them temporary residence until their home country is safe . 
  i think most countries allow them to apply for citizenship after a while , but it 's not a requirement . 
  last election the ep made it pretty clear they will only ratify their chosen presidential candidate which will be the candidate already nominated pre election by the largest party . 
  i 'm not sure even the poles in the uk would be for us merging with poland . 
  why do n't we invite the french while we 're at it ? 
  this is n't eu4 . 
  azerbaijan had a currency peg to the usd until recently too . 
  it 's not surprising their currency would heavily devalue upon removing the peg . 
  that 's the oil price , brl started weakening exactly when the oil price fell . 
  that 's also when they went into recession . 
   she was this mysteriously pretty but very quiet and reserved girl living on the other side of the hall . 
  this sounds like the story to an anime i once watched ... 
  to annex poland and the v4 ? 
  yes , as i said , it took them decades to do so . 
  of course they do n't , that 's why we 've been sanctioning them for over a decade . 
  it 's not like hiding this shit is easy to do , making a nuclear weapon takes massive amounts of infrastructure to produce the required fissile material . 
  we also made a deal with iran recently to allow inspectors back in and slowly reduce sanctions . 
  they have been trying to develop them for * decades * though ... 
  what . 
  ... that the uk is not connected and they are simply in discussions ( as your last article said ) ? 
  as far as the status in 2015 only the companies i listed have equity stakes in the nord stream project . 
  perhaps that will change , perhaps it wo n't , we 'll have to see . 
  an article from 2013 suggests bp may want to get involved . 
  information from 2015 evidently shows they are not . 
  if that changes then of course i 'm wrong , but as it 's stands i 'm not . 
  many countries besides the uk will get gas via nord stream , if that were a qualifier then whole of western europe would qualify . 
  the companies that get the royalties are the ones listed above . 
  it seems all the western media are out to get you !, 
  but it 's ok as long as poland is stronk . 
  the comment section is always full of `` controversial '' flair posts too lol . 
  the uk is n't involved in nord stream as far as i can see . 
  the companies that have control of the project are : gazprom ( 51 % , russian ) wintershall ( 15.5 % , german ) e.on ( 15.5 % , german ) n.v. nederlandse gasunie ( 9 % , dutch ) gdf suez ( 9 % , french ) so 51 % russian , 31 % german , 9 % dutch and 9 % french involvement . 
  it 's a common theme on here of polish users suggesting the west ( and especially germany ) are all out to get them . 
  that poland needs to be more independent and `` strong '' . 
  they do n't seem to realise it 's common for media companies to be foreign owned in every country , hell in the uk a russian oligarch owns one of our major papers . 
  capital is mobile , it 's just how the world works . 
  i do n't know , i think germany is top due to the refugee crisis . 
  [ reference .

  we also have / r/ukpolitics which is somewhat similar to / r/unitedkingdom ( let 's be honest , it 's mostly a politics sub ) and has 41,000 subscribers . 
  i suppose the stereotype is n't that surprising considering our history with china . 
  the communist party propaganda is probably quite favourable to us too considering our governments interactions with china . 
  right , but almost all of these `` subsidies '' [ are just tax exemptions . 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/e60d551fb778cf3a8e7fbb60cb895dce.png ) the inference when you mention them in the same sentence as renewable subsidies is that they are somehow similar , when the latter is a massive cost on the country , not a positive from a monetary perspective . 
  it should , of course , be noted that oil and renewable subsidies are n't especially linked . 
  oil is not used primarily in electricity production while the latter is . 
  promoting oil use ( not that these `` subsidies '' do this as i pointed out previously ) is n't harming renewable usage . 
  with regards to promoting renewables in the energy market , it 's a balance , we ca n't go full renewable , not unless you want all our industry to run off to other 3rd world countries and for our bills to go up 2-3 fold . 
  no there is n't . 
  demand controls how much oil is used , all we 're doing by leaving it in the ground is losing money . 
  you could argue larger supply reduces the oil price but the uk does n't produce nearly enough to have any meaningful effect on that . 
  so reducing corp. tax to 18 % is a subsidy for all businesses in the uk ? 
  come on , i mean you can argue the point if you want but it 's kind of disingenuous when said companies are a massive contributor in net terms , and this is not a subsidy in favour of a certain sector since they already pay tax higher than others ( i.e. 
  they 're already penalised ) . 
  with regards to taxes and oil use , if the government wants to incentivize evs and using less fuel they can do that by increasing duty . 
  they do n't need to penalise our oil business such that it 's not even economical to pump oil anymore , that 's just leaving money in the ground for no reason . 
  sure , but if i could see the future and know if i go to x place i 'll be murdered , i 'm probably not going to go there . 
  we 're talking about hindsight here . 
  in hindsight it might not be worth doing something that causes you to lose a large part of your country , equally in hindsight it might not be worth going somewhere you know you 're going to be murdered . 
  [ cameron remix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vblgg5ugekw ) , it 's really fantastic !, 
  expensive , and nimbyism . 
  it 's a balancing act for the government , people already complain energy prices are too high and renewables do n't help in that regard . 
  renewables are expensive as hell in the uk . 
  i do n't know how it compares elsewhere in europe but the lcoe is ~ 40 % higher for wind and double the price for solar than it is for gas for instance . 
  i 'm sorry but this is nonsense . 
  you ca n't claim that an industry that [ pays corporation tax far in excess of any other industry ] ( https://www.gov.uk/guidance/oil-and-gas-taxation ) is receiving subsidies from the uk government . 
  so what if they 're cutting the tax rates from an already huge number to a slightly less huge number , the oil price is rock bottom at the moment and these wells are n't nearly as profitable as they were in the past . 
  for reference : * `` the marginal tax rate is 75 % ( 67.5 % from 1 january 2016 ) on income from fields paying prt and 50 % for other fields . 
  '' * the corporation tax for standard businesses is 20 % , due to be reduced to 18 % by 2020 . 
  there were no defense guarantees . 
  so do you think it was worth becoming more friendly with the west if the cost is losing large parts of your country because that was the point i was making . 
  i suppose in some ways it 's good for those in the west of ukraine ( in the long run ) but pretty shitty for those in the east . 
  do you think the people are happy about losing large parts of their country ? 
  this was the wrong decision in hindsight . 
  ukraine should have been either left in the russian sphere or defensive guarantees made . 
  hopefully we 'll learn from this when trying to expand the eu further , putin is not to be underestimated . 
  well they should , they just lost a large part of their territory due to ignoring the kremlin . 
  as we all know , the best way to combat a recession is more austerity ... how do these people even get elected ? 
  fair enough , just point out why they are wrong ( not to me , but in general lol ) !, 
  so make that your op , do n't just lazily attack the writer/paper . 
  sorry , just this happens a lot on here and it 's really not great for discussion ... 
  of course he 's biased , everyone is biased to some extent and this is published in a left wing paper ( not only that but in the * opinion section * ) . 
  it does n't necessarily make his arguments less valid as i said . 
  people ca n't just disregard everything from the `` leftist media '' as propaganda , just as those on the left ca n't disregard everything on the right . 
  look at the arguments proposed not where the writer comes from or his political associations . 
   remi adekoya was born and raised in nigeria . 
  he is the former political editor of the warsaw business journal .
