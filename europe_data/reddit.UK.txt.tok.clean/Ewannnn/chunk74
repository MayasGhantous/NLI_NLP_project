  yes if you go back 150 years . 
  could also use the german example in which case 65 years and yes again . 
  could use the american example although they 've never tried to invade us they do own huge amounts of our country . 
  the truth is we do n't really see anyone ( people ) in this way , which is why we have lots of russian/chinese investment too . 
  hell a russian oligarch owns one of our major newspapers ( the independent ) . 
  that 's just how the world works , capital is mobile and it comes from everywhere . 
  you ca n't just shut yourselves off and expect to flourish or grow , that 's why russia has experienced capital flight for decades . 
  what is it with polish people on here , they seem to have this constant fear of being sabotaged by the west and germany in particular . 
  it 's so weird . 
  in the west we do n't ever think about things in this way . 
  i do n't ever fear france invade , control or harm the uk in any way . 
  they are our friends and our allies . 
  do you guys not realise you are in the eu , in nato , these are your friends to be trusted not given permanent suspicions and paranoia . 
  it reminds me of this conversation i had the other day about nordstream ( with another polish person ) and how i should fear germany controlling more gas coming to the west because it gives them power over us and they may turn it off . 
  many e. europeans seem to think this is an actual concern , it 's not , in the west we do n't even think about things in this way . 
  this kind of attitude just makes others not want to trust you y' know ? 
  not want to help , not want to get involved in your country . 
  it 's very isolating . 
  i hope it 's just polish users on these forums and not those in real life that project this insecurity and paranoia . 
  not sure why that 's really a bad thing either , the eu only needs to be united on trade issues . 
  i quoted you before you added any of that , it was just `` why the foreign minister and not the finance/economics one ? '', 
  i think he said being in the euro is good , as it made finnish business more competitive . 
  it was a while ago though , i could be misremembering . 
  this is typical of the british media , they refer to anyone slightly left as hard left and extremist . 
  to be honest i actually really believe in this philosophy . 
  i think the more we can pull countries into the western sphere the better . 
  i do however want to see it stay a business relationship . 
  i do n't want to see britain siding with them politically while their views on most issues are so fucked up . 
  eh , the qe programme is n't the main reason for pound depreciation against the dollar . 
  it 's not the main reason for ez depreciation either , it has more to do with rising fed rates ( well , the prospect of in 2014 at least ) in the us and better growth prospects there . 
  remember the us had their own qe programme at the same time we had ours as well . 
  as i recall sterling actually did n't depreciate at all vs the dollar while we were doing qe . 
  could be remembering wrong though . 
  edit : yeah sterling actually improved in value when we were doing qe against the dollar lol !, 
  early 2009 to mid 2009 , massive increase in value . 
  [ the lost decade ? 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/4c701e3cf9dcf85d1cfdea9223a0773d.png ) then again , knowing previous imf estimates of greek growth this will be laughably wrong . 
  better growth prospects and less risk , so more demand for our currency and thus less devaluation .

  more imf data [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/index.aspx ) edit : also if anyone wants historical gdp data , you can find it [ here ] ( http://www.worldeconomics.com/data/madisonhistoricalgdp/madison%20historical%20gdp%20data.efp ) going back to the 19th century . 
  it 's also nominal gdp , in ppp terms they 're just slightly behind germany . 
  maddison project data for switzerland [ only goes back to 1850 ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/85ffc0f9dc7e3f9455c997cfd4340636.png ) , and it seems you 're right the country was poorer back then although not really poor . 
  it 's possibly true that before 1850 that was the case , but i do n't have data for it . 
  switzerland has always been a small economy though , and although they were richer per capita than the uk , they were n't nearly as powerful ( in 1924 when switzerland overtook the uk , our economy was still over 10 times larger ) . 
  capability / funding for research etc i 'm sure was always much greater in the uk . 
  it depends , the biggest cost of living is housing . 
  if people are guaranteed a certain amount of money pa ( unconditionally ) then they can probably survive on less and use it more efficiently . 
  for instance , currently the average cash benefit in the uk paid out to all households ( this includes state pension etc ) is # 6000 pa ( ons figures ) . 
  now that would n't be nearly enough to live anywhere in london , but it would certainly be enough to live in many of the poorer parts of the country . 
  of course a lot of that money for higher earners would get swallowed in taxes , so the state could afford to give out more than this ( # 8000 pa perhaps ? ), 
  without raising taxes . 
  again # 8000 would n't be enough for london , but it would be fine for many other places . 
  the simplification argument is kinda nonsense though i agree . 
  admin costs are tiny on welfare . 
  the issue is the system is complicated , and many people do n't get what they 're allotted . 
  a universal benefit is always going to be better if it 's possible to fund such a system . 
  switzerland has always been wealthy . 
  in 1900 per capita gdp in switzerland was the 2nd highest in europe behind the uk . 
  swiss gdp per capita overtook the uk in 1924 to become the richest state in europe . 
  this remained the case for a number of years until 1936 when the uk overtook them again . 
  this had reversed by the end of ww2 and afterwards switzerland experienced massive growth for decades , it was n't until 1997 that they were finally overtaken by denmark as the richest state in europe . 
  all data is from maddison project of historical gdp , see some of that data [ here . 
  to be honest , oil and gas are strategic exports too , i would disagree with the op they 're not powerful economically . 
  without russian exports , our economies in western europe , for the most part , would totally collapse . 
  of course , the same can be said for russia , it is a mutually beneficial relationship , but the russians would probably survive better than we would i think . 
  this dependency is only going to grow stronger over the coming decades too as supplies fall elsewhere . 
  i would actually say their strength as an energy power is greater than their strength as a military power . 
  the latter has been waning for decades , but the former is only going to grow stronger . 
  [ they ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosatom ) provide power for a lot of mostly non-aligned states , they are very much a [ world leader ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/e92c749835e42df9fafea8371988825f.png ) in that market . 
  of course , he 's not wrong that most exports are energy based . 
  from what i read from other spanish posters it will likely lead to a pp victory . 
  they 'll replace their leader and steal votes from c 's . 
  they do n't need that many votes to get the required # seats . 
  that 's just our fucked up voting system though , the proportion of the vote gained by minor parties did n't change much between 2010 and 2015 ( 65.1 % in 2010 for major parties vs 67.3 % in 2015 ) . 
  if we used the same electoral system as in spain the two party system would be permanently shattered , and would have been so for decades already . 
  of course they are , the help-to-buy scheme does exactly that . 
  instead of pushing down house prices to actual affordable levels they just make it easier for first time buyers to get larger and larger amounts of credit . 
  this inflates the housing market even higher than it already is . 
  if people could n't get such large mortgages they would n't be able to afford to buy and prices would fall . 
  you 're a politics undergraduate , yet you post so little about politics !, 
  on uk subs at least . 
  also , i assumed you were older than that ha !, 
  you 're right , the argument is similar , the issue really is how far back such claims are valid . 
  if a piece of rock was owned by someone else 300 years ago , but the current inhabitants have lived there 100 years or more who has the better claim ? 
  for me the latter but i suppose it 's a matter of opinion and who has the bigger stick at the end of the day . 
  similar issue in palestine-israel conflict as well of course . 
  depends if they win any constituencies or not . 
  the result among the major parties would have been more even though . 
  fucking old people , screwing up elections everywhere !, 
  ( for the young ) wonder what the turnout is like in spain for younger voters , it 's god awful in the uk . 
  damn it dude , stop using american phrases , i do n't know what half of that even meant !, 
  lack of a settlement with israel to create proper borders . 
  they do n't control large areas of their territory . 
  there has been many attempts to make a deal in the past , all were either rejected or fell apart . 
  since hamas gained control of gaza in 2006 there is next to zero possibility of palestine becoming independent to be honest . 
  is it really surprising ? 
  hamas is labeled as a terrorist organisation by many countries and has been attacking israel for decades . 
  hamas ? 
  psoe is n't for a referendum though i would guess , so it 's more likely they will get tax reform .
