  if e. europe does n't want to deal with russia , that 's fine , but they should n't impose that on us . 
  no , it does n't , but what we 're doing at the moment is toothless and pointless . 
  we could enforce a ceasefire in ukraine militarily and broker a peace treaty . 
  but we have to accept that ukraine former is never going to be a country again and what they 've lost up to this point is gone forever . 
  that 's the reality and nothing is going to change it . 
  well , no , it 's not wrong , it just seems there are different ways of classifying the data that produces different results . 
  so it 's actually about e. europe wanting to control the west in reality . 
  in that case , i fully support germany in cutting out e. europe . 
  this is just a power play by both sides . 
  [ this ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/est/show/all/2013/ ) is the source , it 's 2013 as i said . 
  explanation of where data comes from [ here . 
  ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/resources/data/ ), 
  better to rely on germany than to rely on russia do n't you think ? 
  as i said , this would improve energy security for e. europe , you have n't really explained why that 's not the case . 
  unless you think germany would cut off gas to e. europe ? 
  the best solution to deal with russia from both sides is for russia to deal with the countries they ca n't afford to fuck with . 
  this essentially means in reality that the eu is dealing with russia as a bloc instead of individually ( because western europe makes up the vast majority of the eu economy ) . 
  so how would that not be solved by a pipeline between germany and eastern europe , i.e. 
  a more integrated european energy market , as is a focus right now ? 
  so how am i wrong ? 
  would you rather buy gas from russia or germany ? 
  these sanctions are toothless anyway , they do n't do anything . 
  the biggest sanction against russia is the oil price . 
  well , he * would * say that . 
  let 's see what the eu commission has to say , tusk is hardly the most impartial figure in this deal . 
  too true . 
  simply running around saying how evil russia is and asking for a new cold war is n't going to improve the situation for ukraine or anyone . 
  if coupled with gas pipelines between germany and eastern europe this deal could improve energy security in the east . 
  instead of buying from russia , they could buy gas from germany . 
  this deal could be a win-win for both e. europe , germany and russia . 
  the only country it probably would n't be a win for is ukraine . 
  the russian sanctions are n't about stopping trade , if they were the eu would collapse ( ** especially eastern europe ** ) . 
  the sanctions are about targeting specific individuals . 
  i do believe us sanctions are more thorough , but the us barely trades at all with russia anyway . 
  does e. europe want sanctions ? 
  i do n't believe that , it 's all just posturing and hot air . 
  almost 1/4 of some e. european trade relies on russia , they are far more reliant on them than the west is . 
  their economies would lose billions under any proper trade sanctions . 
  edit : some stats for 2013 : * `` for instance , 15 % of estonian imports came from russia , higher than any other country . 
  for lithuania that figure is way higher at 27 % , for latvia , it is 11 % , for finland 18 % , for poland 10 % . 
  for germany , on the other hand , it is only 2.6 % . 
  * * the situation is similar for exports . 
  germany-russian exports are 3.3 % of total , for poland this is 5.2 % , estonia 17 % , latvia 11 % , lithuania 16 % , finland 8.6 % . 
  '' * so yea , good luck sanctioning your largest trade partner . 
  sounds like a fantastic idea !, 
  eu economies could do with more senseless hemorrhaging . 
  yea , no this only works in very limited cases . 
  it does nothing for qmv and laws past by previous governments , sometimes decades ago . 
  there 's a reason so many models are eastern european . 
  lot of pornstars too now that i think about it . 
  [ the student room ] ( http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/ ) is pretty huge , i used to post there a lot when i was a student . 
  i think one of the biggest benefits is help and guidance in modernising their economies and stamping out corruption , as well as more foreign direct investment . 
  corruption really is a plague for developing countries that can hold them back hugely . 
  not interested / old, 
  for russia , not for germany and other countries in western europe that need the gas . 
  also as discussed elsewhere in this thread , the best way to deal with russian price gauging eastern european states is internal trade . 
  this would mean a pipe going from germany to e. europe independently of any russian pipe delivering russian oil / gas to europe . 
  this would make e. europe entirely independent of russia as far as energy is concerned . 
  it 's better if russia just deals with the larger countries that can bargain a good deal . 
  just look at countries exports / imports , the only real exception is countries that are in regions that are n't very developed ( so lack local trading partners ) , so africa and parts of asia . 
  you can see export data [ here . 
  ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/gbr/show/all/2012/ ) nafta / asean are n't a trading bloc in the same way as the eu , they do n't have common non-trade barriers and tariffs for states outside the bloc and they do n't deal with external trade as one bloc . 
  when dealing with trade between the uk and us we only have to deal with america , however when dealing with trade between the uk and germany we have to deal with the eu . 
  so in matters of trade negotiation and tariffs / non-tariff barriers the eu is one group . 
  i 'm not a jedi , but trading patterns would suggest a countries largest trading partner is going to be those countries that are closest geographically . 
  for the purposes of trade the eu can be seen as one bloc even if it is multiple countries . 
  sure , but point being the eu will always be the uks single largest trading partner . 
  sure but when they 're above ground the countries it goes through have to be paid . 
  not so if it just goes directly to germany . 
  i still think the idea of bypassing ukraine is a good idea , but i do n't really know why they could n't have a pipeline going via baltics and poland , do you know ? 
  presumably , this kind of pipeline would be cheaper to build and service as you said , although it may be slightly more expensive for western europe due to transit fees . 
  i do n't know , i think it depends ultimately on the cost difference between the two options ( if there even was an option to go via baltics ) . 
  i do n't think the west should really feel sorry for depriving eastern europe of transit fees , we 're ultimately responsible for our own citizens not those of other countries . 
  they already get a huge amount of structural funds from the eu too anyway . 
  cheaply for who ? 
  is it unnecessary though really ? 
  north sea gas is declining in production rapidly and russia is the only long term option for gas outside the middle east - they have by far the world 's largest proven reserves . 
  also , why is it necessarily bad that e. europe loses transit fees , it may be bad for them , but it 's better for w. europe because the price will be lower ? 
  with the potential for lower oil / gas prices by exporting within the eu , you would think this would be a net positive even with transit fee losses ? 
  not having to deal with ukrainian issues with russia is a positive too not a negative as far as i can see ( for everyone besides ukraine ) . 
  thanks , that makes sense . 
  most of the hyperbole in this thread is then , as i suspected , hyperbole . 
  in terms of exports the eu is still by far our largest trading partner though , being # 9.8 billion in aug 2015 . 
  usa was second largest at # 3.3 billion . 
  for imports we still get the [ majority of our goods from the eu ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/b790fa67e9e62064fef643245f0f0fac.png ) , at # 16 billion , compared with non-eu of # 14.6 billion . 
  trade with europe is hugely important for the uk , more than any other region by far . 
  this is extremely unlikely to ever change . 
  the right time to oppose would have been when the lisbon treaty was being voted on . 
  as it stands now we have little bargaining power . 
  even a decade ago ukraine was having conflicts with russia over gas to be honest . 
  it 's hardly a new issue . 
  [ there are n't that many options long term ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/ae066a2d85b25224c30e3f9ff1ee2421.png ) , we 're either dealing with russia or the middle east and to be honest the middle east is much more of a shitshow imo . 
  i mean until very recently iran was sanctioned to all hell , and who knows if the nuclear deal will last . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but in the past it was my understanding that russia does n't allow oil / gas resale , and that 's the primary problem . 
  it means eastern states need to buy directly from russia . 
  i suppose with more west-east capacity they could just buy from someone else though , norway for example ? 
  it 's about making supply more reliable bypassing ukraine , which to be honest is quite understandable [ considering the history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93ukraine_gas_disputes ) . 
  it 's also about increasing capacity which will be needed in the future as european supplies decline . 
  eastern europe relies on russia more than most states in europe . 
  they 're not benefitting economically from any kind of embargo against russia , especially not an importation embargo which the op seems to suggest is a good idea .
