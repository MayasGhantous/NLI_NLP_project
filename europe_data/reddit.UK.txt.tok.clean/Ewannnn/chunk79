   declaring other races subhuman  reasonable debate, 
  ` fascism ' is a word thrown around a lot here , i do n't think most people actually understand what the word means . 
  let 's be honest , that 's just a cop-out , most users here hate any kind of immigrants refugees or otherwise . 
  let 's just say , if their country bordered syria they would have the gulf strategy , not the turkish or lebanese strategy . 
  he 's referring to the issues of integration and ghettoization in france which is n't nearly as bad in the uk . 
  france has a more conformist approach to outside cultures ( that is they must conform to french society ) and this excludes people . 
  on top of that immigrants in [ france have real issues with unemployment ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/bb308697cee1a95b0c55e2dbc74a8b7f.png ) , which are n't nearly as acute in the uk . 
  cutting benefits is n't the solution , we 'd just end up with ghettos like france does . 
  better to pay them a pittance and keep them off the street and away from crime than to starve them and have them on the street . 
  it 's not like we can even deport them if they commit crimes anyway and it costs # 25k + per year to keep anyone in prison . 
  i mean do you want more gypsies ? 
  because that 's how you get more gypsies . 
  also , as the article noted , we 're hardly the best as far as benefits are concerned , and getting accepted for asylum here is more difficult than in some countries ( look at acceptance rates ) . 
  that 's insane . 
  american politics is indeed a lot more right wing than uk politics , and uk politics is in itself more right wing than a lot of countries on the continent ( talking western europe here ) . 
  i tend to see our politics as an in between europe and the us . 
  the young have always been more left wing in the uk , this is not a new phenomenon . 
  today 's pensioners were yesterday 's ` freedom fighters ' . 
  by 2020 , the majority voting demographic will be people 55 + :-\\ in 2015 , the amount of the government budget spent on pensions and [ healthcare ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/6e5af827ec4af57318343865edca1149.png ) combined is 48 % of the government total . 
  if we go back to 1960 that figure was 18 % , in 1980 22 % , in 2000 35 % . 
  we 're so fucked . 
  as far as i know it was already legal since iraq was fighting isis in their own territory , so the imminent threat requirement was already met . 
  the threat to other countries was n't met ( this of course depends who you ask , as below , the uk/us would argue this was already the case , it 's the justification they used for bombing jihadi john for instance ) although it 's possible , as you say , that this resolution changes that fact . 
  i 'm not totally sure if the threat to iraq makes it legal for us to intervene in syria prior to the resolution ( it 's definitely legal for iraq to do so though ) , i believe so , that 's the justification the government was giving at least . 
  of course , none of this matters much . 
  america has been using a very loose legal definition of `` imminent threat '' for over a decade to justify its drone programme . 
  bombing targets in somalia , yemen , pakistan , iraq , syria , etc in `` defense '' of the us . 
  all without the express consent of the governments involved i should note ( in most cases ) . 
  the issue for russia , and perhaps why a chapter 7 resolution was n't put forward , is as i said before , potential for attacks on assad under the guise of stopping isis or saving civilians . 
  you joke , but something does need to be done . 
  intergenerational fairness is getting completely destroyed in the uk currently , and it 's only going to get worse . 
  obviously restricting people 's right to vote is n't a viable alternative though . 
  the un resolution is n't what makes it legal , the required resolution would be a chapter 7 resolution , which the syria resolution was not . 
  the justification for intervention in syria is article 51 of the un charter on the right to self-defense , namely the country of iraq . 
  they could have put forward a chapter 7 resolution , [ as we did in libya for instance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1973 ) , and that would have directly sanctioned military action . 
  but russia may well have vetoed such a request due to the potential for mission creep as what happened in libya . 
  we went in under the guise of saving civilians but essentially went in for regime change . 
  they wo n't , as retirees die more are created . 
  european demographics are getting older not younger , and peoples priorities change with age . 
  voter turnout by age in the uk 2015 election , plus percentage of total voters adjusted for turnout : 18-24 | 43 % | 7.5 % 25-34 | 54 % | 14 % 35-44 | 64 % | 15.9 % 45-54 | 72 % | 19.5 % 55-64 | 77 % | 16.8 % 65 + | 78 % | 26.3 % by 2020 , the majority of voters will be 55 + . 
  it 's not looking good if you 're a young person alive right now from a political perspective . 
  immigration is more of an old persons concern than the young in the uk . 
  it 's still a concern for the young too of course , just not nearly as much . 
  edit : sigh downvoting because the facts do n't match your preconcieved ideas ? 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbc-newsnight_migrant-crisis-survey_september-2015.pdf ) , [ here ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/58hsi5v1r3/timesresults_151117_parisbombing_website.pdf ) and [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/assets/docs/polls/august15issuestabs.pdf ) it should be fairly obvious to anyone with how voting demographics work in the uk that immigration is more of a concern for the older generation . 
  young people overwhelmingly vote for left-leaning candidates in elections . 
  this is n't the case in the uk . 
  the young vote for left-leaning candidates far more than they vote for right leaning candidates . 
  43 % of 18-24-year-olds voted labour in 2015 , 27 % conservative , 8 % green and ukip , and 5 % ld . 
  for the old this is the polar opposite : 47 % of over 65s voted conservative , 23 % voted labour , 17 % voted ukip , 8 % voted ld and 2 % voted green . 
  you say that , but they can and do ignore the unsc and just do it anyway . 
  see action in syria and iraq for recent examples of this . 
  the unsc helps create dialogue , but it 's definitely not a perfect system and major powers do ignore it if dialogue does n't result in anything . 
  crime is falling and we do n't have a massive foreign worker unemployment problem like many countries in europe . 
  it seems to be working well overall . 
  i do n't see any massive issues . 
  oh no , i just find it amusing that some people think immigration and religion are the cause for all woes in this world . 
  i think some cultures are incompatible , namely the extremes ( wahhabism as you say ) but this does n't mean multiculturalism has failed . 
  indeed i think it works really great in britain , but of course not everyone agrees because not everyone likes change . 
  which is fine . 
  that 's what he 's saying , microstates tend to have larger disparities , especially ones that are essentially tax havens . 
  let me guess lidyan ... 
  it 's the fault of immigration ? 
  yea , the american equivalent is the f-16 and f-18 , which look more similar to the rafale . 
  it 's the stealth tech that makes it look modern as you say . 
  the german system has that too as far as i know , although i think it 's still a regional list not national ( see [ here ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/ad8ffcd85e7ddab479533057c436ca67.png ) ) . 
  i know the scottish system is n't entirely proportional though , which is why the snp managed to get their majority with < 50 % of the vote . 
  i think they use av + in scotland ? 
  edit : nvm they use ams . 
  mmp is the german system :p ukip would get way more than 10-20 mps under the german system , it can ( and is in some districts ) be made entirely proportional . 
  it 's the second vote that determines the makeup of the parliament . 
  so for instance , if a party gets 2 constituency wins , and 2 % of the vote in the second vote , that would be proportional in a 100 member parliament . 
  however , if they won 5 constituencies and a 2 % vote they would be getting 3 extra seats ( overhang seats ) , and this would just get added on to the total so that year you 'd have 103 mps . 
  to make it proportional the other parties would get bonus seats ( balance seats ) , and so your parliament would be 103 mp + x this year . 
  it means the parliament can fluctuate in size a small amount every election . 
  for instance , in the 2005 federal elections , there were 16 overhang seats , in 2009 24 , in 2013 33 . 
  so basically , ukip would get around 83 mps , almost entirely from party list candidates . 
  greens would get around 25 . 
  this is , of course , assuming we have fewer constituency mps , if we did n't they 'd get a lot more than this and our parliament would be huge !, 
  i think that 's just a difference in developmental language to be honest . 
  the f-22 was introduced into service in 2005 and the rafale in 2001 . 
  i mean the f-22 was developed from a previous prototype ( yf-22 ) that was first flown in 1990 , which would give a similar developmental period for both planes ( 15 years ) . 
  [ it 's actually really small !, 
  yea there 's quite a lot of cool next generation stealth craft in development at the moment . 
  bae systems taranis , dassault neuron , ng x-47b , boeing phantom ray , plus a few others . 
  all look like mini versions of the b-2 !, 
  i said they lost 15 % of their 2010 vote to ukip , which is exactly what those polls show . 
  yea , and it would have gone up more had it not been for ukip . 
  see [ here ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/61b9febead65bd82f9866175917a99b3.png ) , [ here ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/42f4e8208fac5a26141af039cc89c5c1.png ) and [ here . 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/19f59cae24b96445039d2be62ecf92cd.png ), 
  yea the f-35 looks almost identical to the f-22 to be honest , it 's just a fair bit smaller . 
  the f-22 looks the most modern to be honest , even though they 're all approx the same age . 
  on the subject of planes , the b-2 bomber is still by far my favourite . 
  that [ plane ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ortieru.jpg ) is a [ work of art . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9jcixrw.jpg ) edit : [ watch this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p30jf6bn2ea ) , it 's magnificent !, 
  heh , nice catch . 
  it 's not blackmail , that would presuppose that it was the eus fault that you were in that situation to begin with . 
  which is n't the case , greece is sovereign . 
  the eu countries are n't under any obligation to give you anything .
