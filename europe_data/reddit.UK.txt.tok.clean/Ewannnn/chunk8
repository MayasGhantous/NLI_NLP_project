  we have a # 12 billion per year ( and ever increasing , fixed at 0.7 % of gdp ) foreign aid budget & much more of that should be going to these countries ( currently only around # 250 million does , of course a lot goes in through multilateral aid too ( 44 % of uk aid is given to multilateral aid organisations like the un ) ) . 
  billions of more direct foreign investment could go a long way to helping these countries recover & making sure this shitstorm does n't happen again . 
  many here would agree that this is especially the case in libya , where there was far too little investment after the fall of gaddafi . 
  that being said , the us did invest ** massive ** amounts in iraq & that country still imploded , so it 's not a foolproof method , but still better than the status quo for sure . 
  the refugee effort in neighbouring countries is massively under funded at the moment that 's for sure . 
  not without a logical plan & endgame no . 
  there is no legitimate government in syria to call on our help , there are no ground troops to support our airstrikes , even if we succeed we let back in a dictator that gases his own people . 
  you really want to get involved in that mess ? 
  furthermore consider what sort of impact we can even make , the amount of airstrikes we 're already carrying out [ pales in comparison to america ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/900930a575c5602ae65fdb7917c90a1e.png ) , do we really want to spread out capability even further ? 
  the main reason afghanistan was such a fuckup was because we tried to do too much at once . 
  well many would disagree with you , and the un has urged us to open dialogue with argentina . 
  at the end of the day this issue is n't going to go away without reaching some sort of agreement & legal decision . 
  nothing , just the media being fanatical as usual . 
  public opinion is like a yoyo , this will all be forgotten in 6 months over winter . 
  we should n't be bombing isis in syria . 
  opening up dialogue with argentina is n't a terrible idea , to squash the problem once & for all . 
  the nationalisation without compensation thing was if the public had been duped & the sale undervalued . 
  many support disarmament as polls show although i do n't believe for one second it will be a labour party policy under corbyn . 
  immigration ? 
  tax & spend , this is bad now ? 
  you better not move to anywhere on the continent !, 
  maximum wages are a bit bonkers i agree . 
  aside from economic sanctions there 's very little we can do in ukraine or georgia . 
  uk government wants to do the same , hopefully they wo n't be able to get a consensus in parliament so it wo n't go ahead . 
  if corbyn wins the labour leadership election that 's sure to be the case . 
  in iraq it makes sense , you have a democratically elected government asking for our help & ground troops to support our air strikes . 
  in syria ? 
  we have a dictator on one side who gases his own people & isis on the other , plus no reliable ground troops to coordinate with airstrikes . 
  greece lost 37 trillion euros to vat evasion ? 
  damn that 's a lot !, 
  no wonder they 're in financial trouble !, 
  i think that was his point . 
  it really would be huge though dude , wales has the lowest gva of any uk county at # 16893 per head compared to the uk avg of # 23394 . 
  the region is massively massively subsidized at the moment . 
  greens as long as it 's not a labour/conservative marginal , if it is i 'll vote labour . 
  election is 5 years away so i doubt i 'll be living in the same place . 
  what is it with people filming things like this on their phones ( or any musical event ) . 
  they 're never going to watch the footage . 
  felt like posting this after seeing [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3jo6fe/swedish_professor_from_karolinska_institute_gives/ ) in / r/videos where rosling kinda chews out a journalist for only concentrating on the negative aspects of world events , & how viewers should be sceptical of getting information from the news . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e ) a documentary he did for the bbc going further into depth on the figures & the reasons for population growth . 
  [ here 's the un datasets ] ( http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/ ) on where they predict the world population is going to be in the future . 
  this looks like a prison lol, 
  i 'm not sure about this visualisation , perhaps i 'm just not a visual person but it does n't make anything more clear [ than a spreadsheet would ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_quarterly_report ) . 
  in fact it 's a whole lot less clear for me at least . 
  [ there are only q1 stats . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_quarterly_report ), 
  if you want to know just pm them , you should get a response . 
  they never explain these things in the threads themselves . 
  i would presume the reasoning is that there is no proof the media is misrepresenting this ( from previous posts on this topic ) . 
  this does n't really show police attacking migrants , more controlling them . 
  what does the article actually say ? 
  haha yes i 'm not sure how accurate this website is , i was more referring to websites like [ this ] ( https://voteforpolicies.org.uk/ ) that quiz people on actual political party policies . 
  in the uk a lot of the problem is fptp though i think . 
  he 's not entirely wrong , people do often vote against their interests , especially when there are certain red line issues that completely take over their voting possibilities . 
  at the end of the day most people do n't care about politics though , i would n't be surprised if most of them could n't even name one policy of the guy they 're voting for . 
  you should see our news media , on [ bbc newsnight ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b069b49f/newsnight-03092015 ) ( watch from around 6 minutes if you want to be really infuriated with the line of questioning ... ) the presenter was literally saying we had n't seen scenes like this since the 1930s . 
  it 's like people are just waking up to what is happening , but this has been going on for years now . 
  the media are [ all changing their tune ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2015/09/cockroaches-campaigns-how-uk-press-u-turned-refugee-crisis ) too . 
  i do n't know , it 's strange , there are 19 million refugees in this world but people are reacting like this is a new phenomenon . 
  no , its always happened it just was n't in the news till now & it was n't happening on our borders so hardly anyone cared . 
  edit : correction, 
  with france , germany & italy supporting it & britain having an opt out does this mean he has the votes ? 
  what 's the situation in this regard , do nations have veto over this policy ( aside from those with opt outs ) ? 
  london is a shithole , if i had the money i 'd go live in switzerland or somewhere in the mountains . 
  also i live in yorkshire , it 's a nice county , we have lots of scenery like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dj4rkvb.jpg ) . 
  if you live in london about the best you can do as far as scenery is concerned is hampstead heath , which while nice is still within a city . 
  looking at pictures on the internet does n't help you deal with the real thing in life . 
  there 's literally no point looking at images like that . 
  not really , more that this is a shocking image & shocking images sell newspapers . 
  not really any agenda here other than to make money . 
  ireland ca n't make free trade deals with the uk , they ca n't make free trade deals with anyone , only the eu can on ireland 's behalf . 
  that 's my understanding at least . 
  it 's common for people posting new submissions to downvote all the other submissions when they do so . 
  check to see if anyone else posted at a similar time . 
  people do it with comments too sometimes . 
  irish gdp will shrink a lot in the short term ( well a few % , which i would class as a lot ) if we leave without a free trade deal in place . 
  norway will suffer even worse problems than ireland i would expect in the short term . 
  long term things will correct themselves as they do , ireland will trade more with the eu , the uk more with the rest of the world . 
  it 's definitely not good for anyone , put it that way . 
  indeed , all i really know about georgia is that they went to war with russia a few years ago & they still have a fairly large part of their territory controlled by russia . 
  250 billion euros is pretty large , some countries rely on the uk for 20 % + of their exports . 
  if the union has to be vindictive to keep its members in line i do n't think that 's a union people are going to want to be a part of , especially if it costs them billions of euros per year in lost trade . 
  people are n't in the business of losing money they do n't have to . 
  it would massively affect some economies , 20 % + of norways exports head to the uk , 30 % + from ireland . 
  it will be an end to ukip & the conservatives will receive a massive blow . 
  unless it goes well , but i ca n't see how it would considering our trade situation . 
  20 years ? 
  are you having a laugh ? 
  you think they will wait 20 years to make a free trade agreement with their largest external trade partner ? 
  \\ #justnorwegianproblems in some countries people worry about being stoned to death , in norway they worry about not getting their own private bathroom . 
  both sides do it , try putting a positive view on immigration in any thread & your post will be censored by the downvote button within minutes . 
  thanks that worked . 
  how ? 
  i just tried to add . np to the domain name & i [ get this error ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/0fcfb8d0fd158e8ea802736e8af08c11.png ) . 
  in principle i see the eu parliament as more democratic than our parliament . 
  yes turnout is low but that is people 's choice , but those that do vote are much more likely to get their opinion represented under a pr system than fptp . 
  cameron should look closer to home before criticizing the democratic nature of the eu institutions , i mean even our entire upper house is unelected for christ sake !, 
  south east is included in with london . 
  the dales have a lot of sheep but i 've never heard of people being referred to in that way either . 
  east yorkshire does n't really have many farm animals , it 's mostly just fields .
