  that 's not good for american hegemony . 
  i was just reading about it on wikipedia , and it seems he ca n't even be charged for some of the crimes any more due to the statute of limitations . 
  if he stays in the embassy till 2020 he ca n't be charged with anything . 
  makes a total mockery of the law to be honest . 
  yes , for people in the middle east , we caused the same issues in africa , but it 's not as much a `` problem '' for us as long as it 's self contained . 
  that 's their choice . 
  most of the islamic terrorism aimed at the west started in the 80s and 90s as a direct result of us and russian intervention . 
  if they were n't trying to bomb `` the invaders '' i.e. 
  the `` west '' , but were just killing each other , people would n't care as much . 
  this is basically what goes on in africa and no one cares . 
  when you have a sea border it 's difficult to deal with , because once they 've crossed into your territory you ca n't deport them . 
  perhaps a deal could have been done with turkey earlier , but even that would have involved accepting potentially similar numbers of refugees . 
  so that you win easier as i said . 
  politics is n't about playing fair . 
  well , you can try , but some people will always be convinced . 
  it 's better not to give them a platform , if possible . 
  unless they actually are bigots , in which case it could work . 
  of course that ship has sailed with fn to be honest , they have a platform now . 
  the best option for the other parties now is to paint them as racist so that people wo n't feel they can vote for them . 
  that tactic wo n't work forever though . 
  that depends if they actually are bigots or not . 
  if they 're not , then giving them a platform is the worst thing you could possibly do . 
  so they do n't realise how damaging it is for their health to burn plastic ? 
  christ , i did n't realise people in poland were this poor ( i thought poland was doing pretty well ! ) . 
  i mean i presume that 's the reason . 
  what . 
  people actually do this ? 
  that 's ridiculously dangerous . 
  why would n't you just use wood or coal anyway , it 's not exactly expensive . 
  no , it 's not , people very much do n't vote for parties that are perceived to be outside the norm or extreme . 
  that 's why marine le pen has been trying to make the party more mainstream after getting rid of her father jean-marie . 
  perceptions are very important in elections , most people do n't have the time to examine policies much , and those perceived to be far to the left or far to the right will do badly . 
  why is he pm ? 
  the rates are independent of population growth or population size . 
  they 're not independent of population age though ( if you 're not specifying age , i.e. 
  all ) , a country with a low average age is going to have a lower death rate than a country with higher average age , [ since most people die when they 're old !, 
  [ yea , alcohol and smoking seem like a bad idea !, 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/033f761d001304572239b83cd59d2db1.png ) by far the largest risk factors as far as death is concerned . 
  i actually thought cancer was a much bigger killer than it is . 
  seems to me if you live a healthy lifestyle you have a pretty good chance of living for a long time to be honest . 
  most people seem to die from coronary heart disease which you can avoid if you eat right and do exercise . 
  also intriguingly for the 50-69 age range the leading cause of death is cancer , but at 70 + it 's by far heart disease . 
  it 's not missing , it 's just so few people die from war & disaster that it does n't show up in aggregate . 
  for instance in 2010 9 people died in the entire eu from natural disasters . 
  source for all data is from [ here . 
  ] ( http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/ ) it 's weird how some countries seem to have especially high death rates at certain age ranges . 
  for instance , under 5 years romania and bulgaria seem to have especially high rates , but for 15-49 years it is lithuania and latvia that have the highest rates . 
  there are also certain differences in cause of death , for instance if you look at those aged 5-14 , certain countries have very high fatality numbers from `` unintentional injuries '' ( especially romania , latvia , lithuania , estonia and bulgaria ) while others do not . 
  the main cause for this seems to be an [ especially large amount of drownings in these countries !, 
  juncker was the epp candidate , and germany only has 16 % of epp meps . 
  he was n't just the german candidate , he was the candidate for all epp meps that happen to include some german meps . 
  of course 27 german meps wanted schulz , which is just 7 meps less than in the epp ( 34 meps ) . 
  this is so incredibly true , you see it in the media all the time , `` what does germany think . 
  what will merkel do ? '' . 
  as if germany does everything on their own . 
  it 's like the whole greece fiasco , germany got a lot of heat for that but merkel could n't of pushed for bailout alone , she needed support of other countries too . 
  same with the refugee crisis . 
  for future reference , when the link includes a ( or ) symbol , make sure to put a \\ next to it so it 's ignored in the code . 
  so your broken link would for example be this : [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list\\_of\\_countries\\_by\\_gdp_\\\\ ( ppp \\ \\ ) _ per_capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ), 
  it says on the map , no ppp data for n. korea and no nominal data for micronesia , sao tome , principe . 
  seems wrong to me though !,

  world bank seems to have most complete data . 
  [ even in gdp ( nominal ) !, 
  i still do n't see what that has to do with eastern european countries that are already inside the eu . 
  many western countries do n't give a fuck about ukraine . 
  it 's not surprising they would want to remove sanctions . 
  but we 're talking about solidarity with eastern european countries ( those within the eu ) and those countries are n't being invaded by russia last i checked . 
  sanctions that only hurt the eu are n't a good response to that . 
  to be honest ee has got a lot from the west , i think the current arrangement suits them pretty well . 
  sure , and they get it , by being in nato . 
  i 'm not really sure what this line of reasoning has to do with anything . 
  the trade sanctions are in response to russian action in ukraine , a country that is n't even in the eu or nato . 
  if sanctions are dropped it 's not going to have any effect on eastern eu countries . 
  she stood up for our principles not just when it is easy , but also when it is hard . 
  she should be praised for that . 
  there 's no issue if the tax raise results in the status quo . 
  i was just pointing out that without a tax raise some poorer people will lose out . 
  yes it is , a multi-millionaire is n't going to get support from the finnish government . 
  so if you 're giving them money now , while keeping the system revenue neutral , you either have to raise taxes or take money from someone already receiving benefits . 
  also , this issue is n't exactly difficult to solve . 
  you already have to assess people 's income when they get benefits , so instead of removing all the money you can just taper it . 
  there 's no necessity to create an entirely new system , you just need to remove their current benefits entitlement slower than they gain income . 
  if it 's a left-leaning government that supports the welfare state , it probably wo n't mean that many cuts to benefits i think . 
  unless they fundamentally change their tax structure at the same time as you said in your other comment . 
  i would guess they will keep housing and disability benefits separate either way . 
  see [ here . 
  ] ( http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/regional_funding_update_1_dec_2015_151201.pdf ) to be honest though these programmes have been underfunded for years . 
  we should be sending far more money their way than we are . 
  the uk foreign aid budget is something like # 12 billion , we could be funding this entirely ourselves . 
  edit : you can see all funding 2012-2015 [ here . 
  ] ( https://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=special-syriancrisis&amp;year=2014 ) uk was largest single eu country donor in 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 . 
  total uk funding was $ 1.55 billion . 
  germany was the second largest donor at $ 1.21 billion . 
  by the looks of it , norway is by far the largest donor per capita though . 
  then again , they are a much more wealthy country than the uk . 
  also , note that the uk ( and presumably other countries too ) donate a lot via ngos that wo n't turn up in these figures . 
  the uk government [ said in late 2015 ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/473596/dfid_syria_crisis_response_summary__2015.10.29_.pdf ) that they had allocated # 1.1 billion since 2012 to the syrian crisis . 
  question , is it a right wing government or left wing government pushing this proposal ? 
  what is the politics of the group pushing this .
