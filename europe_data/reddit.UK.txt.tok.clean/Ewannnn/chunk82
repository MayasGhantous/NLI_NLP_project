  either some less well off people are going to lose out , or you 're going to need to raise taxes , that 's a fact . 
  you 're giving money to people that currently do n't get any benefits , and you 're not eating that in higher taxes . 
  is n't that what happened in spain ? 
  they all complained , google stopped linking to them , then they whined that google was no longer linking to them ? 
  no , i 'm saying taxing corporations is n't a good way to tax rich people . 
  indeed , a large portion of corporation tax is born by the workers in said corporation themselves , who may well not be wealthy at all . 
  it 's also highly distortionary and avoidable with proper tax planning . 
  i hate to link to the adam smith institute , but [ this ] ( http://www.adamsmith.org/wp-content/uploads/corptax8.pdf ) is a good summary of the problems associated with corp. tax . 
  this is n't true at all . 
  corporations are just collections of individuals at the end of the day , and they never need to be taxed as long as individuals are . 
  in fact from a progressive taxation standpoint it would be better if we did n't tax them at all . 
  [ north africa and albanian are probably the two largest groups aside from italians themselves of course . 
  see [ here ] ( https://fullfact.org/economy/calculating_tax_summary-36103 ) for a balanced view . 
  an amusing fact about these statistics : the chancellors own pension is included under `` welfare '' expenditure . 
  would you class mps compensation as `` welfare '' ? 
  i 'm not sure i agree with that . 
  if you look at piketty 's data [ here ] ( http://topincomes.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/#database: ) you 'll see that the income share for the top 10 % of earners in japan is 40.5 % of the total , while the income share in the uk is 38.08 % . 
  this is for 2010 , and pretax income excluding capital gains ( uk section has no data for this , japanese section does ) . 
  [ also japan has a really high top income tax rate . 
  higher than the uk even . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/japan/personal-income-tax-rate ) edit : looking through the data , denmark seems to be doing great on this . 
  their income share of the top 10 % is 27 % in 2010 . 
  yea agreed it definitely has a rippling effect , just it 's more evident within the eurozone itself since as i said domestic banks are predominantly going to want to keep their money in euros . 
  this is pointed out all the time in the more left-leaning news sources , but still the myth is perpetuated . 
  it 's difficult to get the facts across when papers like the mail push this agenda constantly . 
  see [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/voters-brainwashed-by-tory-welfare-myths-shows-new-poll-8437872.html ) also [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3188/perceptions-are-not-reality-the-top-10-we-get-wrong.aspx ) and of course things like this posted by the government do n't help matters at all . 
  i seem to remember we had this conversation before not long ago . 
  some points i would make : - the ecb is currently on a qe programme , this pushes down bond yields within the eurozone . 
  the uk is no longer doing this . 
  - european investors with currency denominated in euros have to buy bonds predominantly in euros . 
  with unstable countries in the eurozone investors are pushed towards investing in the more stable countries . 
  this pushes down yields in countries such as germany , and pushes up yields in countries such as greece . 
  the uk being the primary user of gbp does n't have this issue . 
  - uk inflation is around 1-2 % higher than germany on average . 
  so to your point , being exposed to greece & co is actually probably a positive for german bond yields , not a negative . 
  also , pertinent to this discussion is another point . 
  often governments will decide to include new things in with military expenditure . 
  for instance paying for more generous military pensions and including that in with military expenditure is a good way to massage the figures ( greece does this a lot ) . 
  this is especially important for countries within nato that are trying to keep to their 2 % commitment . 
  sure but this is n't representative , and if it continues bond yields will likely fall to represent the new norm . 
  for instance if we look at 10y yield between jan 2006 and aug 2015 , the average yield is 3.292 % , while the cpi inflation over the same period is averaged to 2.6 % . 
  so if you look at the headline interest figures they 'd be 3.292 % when the real figure is 0.692 % . 
  of course this is n't the whole picture because there are many other kinds of debt the government issues , but it explains the problem with representing data in this way . 
  there are similar issues when governments talk about spending increases which are actually real terms decreases for instance , very misleading . 
  edit : but yes , i take your point wrt to our debt interest compared to germany . 
  i do n't know the exact figures but i would guess german rates are slightly lower than ours . 
  always bear in mind interest payments are deceptive . 
  if over a 10 year period inflation is 5 % and government bond yields are 5 % pa and the government borrows # 100 billion , this would be labeled as having an interest payment of # 5 billion pa , while the real interest they 're paying is actually zero . 
  the guardian already had a go for them about this last year , although not for the reason in my op . 
  see my other post above . 
  wealth redistribution is always going to be necessary in a capitalist economy , it 's totally unavoidable . 
  i remember reading about this before . 
  just did a search , and hey presto [ this came up . 
  ] ( http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/faculty/social-sciences/news/tax-summary-welfare-research-1.527753 ) this kinda crap really is social engineering at it 's worst . 
  someone independent should be deciding how these statistics are represented , not the treasury . 
  it is blatant propaganda to push their specific welfare agenda . 
  also see [ here . 
  ] ( http://lartsocial.org/cofog ) , `` now cofog categories are far from transparent even to regular users of public finance data , and in some ** cases can be positively misleading for those unfamiliar with the underlying conventions ** . 
  perhaps the most risky of all the categories is ` social protection ' , the one the treasury used to get at its ` welfare ' category . 
  although this is sometimes erroneously used as if synonymous with social security , it also includes personal social services and public sector pensions . 
  ** the figures used by the treasury for ` welfare ' are rather clearly those for the broad cofog ` social protection ' category , but with one of the sub-categories , ` pensions ' , taken out and presented separately ( and somewhat misleadingly ) as ` state pensions ' . 
  ** the remainder , which includes some # 29bn of personal social services spending ( for 2012/13 ) is then presented as ` welfare ' . 
  ( see the image at the top of this article , which is based on the chart/table in the telegraph story but with social services presented separately . ), 
  ** will income taxpayers realise this when they receive their statement from the government next autumn ? 
  of course not . 
  they will assume that transfer payments to people of working age are by far the biggest element in public expenditure ** . 
  and this is not the case : removing social services spending brings the figure for ` welfare ' down to slightly below the level of healthcare expenditure . 
  or , to use the treasury 's preferred strategy of expressing spending in terms of personal tax contributions , it reduces ` your ' contribution to ` welfare ' spending from # 1,024 to # 824 . 
  a further problem with the treasury 's presentation concerns the uk contribution to the eu budget . 
  ** the figures presented seem to be based on the uk 's gross contribution , taking no account of flows of funding in the opposite direction , thus nearly doubling the cost to uk taxpayers . 
  it looks very much as if the treasury has been seeking to exaggerate spending on politically salient and unpopular functions ( or perhaps there was a typo ? ) . 
  ** the presentation of the public finances requires an accounting framework . 
  cofog , for all its imperfections , offers such a framework . 
  ** but when the categories have been amateurishly relabelled and fudged , with categories of different levels being mixed up and gross figures being substituted for net , the result is meaningless as data . 
  ** the cynical response is to say ` that 's politics ' . 
  but one of the purposes of accounting systems is to limit the ability of politicians to misinform the public about the public finances . 
  we are entitled to expect public servants to adhere to the standards set by these systems , not to hunt out ways of exploiting their complexities to blow smoke in the public 's face . 
  ` not quite false ' is not good enough . '', 
  my biggest complaint around this is they should expand out the welfare budget . 
  this just helps justify their welfare cuts and helps push the myth that most of our tax money goes on unemployed people ( look at polling , this is what people think ) . 
  people do n't realise that minute proportion of that spending actually goes towards unemployed people , most is for those in work . 
  i 'm also not entirely sure where they even got this welfare spending figure from . 
  [ only 23 % of spending ] ( https://fullfact.org/economy/welfare_budget_public_spending-29886 ) is on welfare and that includes the state pension . 
  are they both including and then excluding the state pension in this figure ? 
  that 's totally outrageous and misleading . 
  edit : there is a long discussion on this in the / r/mildlyinteresting topic [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/3vsdzf/hmrc_sent_me_a_breakdown_of_how_my_tax_money_was/cxqf2jm ) also see my post below , it does n't include the state pension but it does include equally misleading items within `` welfare '' , including public sector pensions . 
  even the chancellors pension is included in this `` welfare '' figure . 
  if that 's the case there 's nothing at all outrageous about these statistics . 
  i thought it might be something like this when i opened the thread . 
  maaan i hope the uk never splits up . 
  that would be a sad sad day :( bloody snp !, 
  if you look at the last two regional elections in 2010 and 2005 fn lost votes in the second round while the other parties gained votes massively . 
  [ immigration to france is pretty small though ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/087337ee23124d2bbc1ed105e7155f65.png ) , what do they want , total closed borders ? 
  non-french immigration is even lower than this , around 3 per 1000 or 0.3 % pa. . net migration is even lower at 0.1 % , and lower still if you exclude french nationals . 
  i should point out a lot of this is to do with their position on national league tables and nothing to do with religion . 
  i remember there was a panorama episode on it , where parents would go to church for two years just to give their kids a preference when the school is deciding on which pupils to accept . 
  once accepted they would immediately stop going to church entirely .
