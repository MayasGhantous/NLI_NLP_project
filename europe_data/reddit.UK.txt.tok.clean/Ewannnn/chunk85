  it 's so that they can say to their electorate , `` look we tried to reduce eu red tape and reform the eu ! '' . 
  plus you get news reports like this . 
  but do yours have nukes ? 
  dude , they have between five and ten times the displacement , and we all know the bigger the better !, 
  this is due to a mismatch in terms of how much each generation receives from the state . 
  simply removing the sustainable part , i.e. 
  welfare going to working age people , but leaving the unsustainable part , i.e. 
  welfare going to retired people is n't going to work . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but this was your suggestion . 
  working-age welfare spending only becomes unsustainable if unemployment looks like it will never return to where it was precrisis , is that the case ? 
  by the looks of it unemployment is currently close to the [ long running average of around 9 % . 
  who 's fault was it if not the greeks ? 
  perhaps not the population but definitely the corrupt that were in charge . 
  the idiots that decided running a 5 % deficit for decades was a good idea . 
  they were n't second hand , by the looks of it , you are referring to [ these . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_214_submarine#portugal ) sounds like it was a terrible deal though unfortunately , way more than portugal could afford : `` this is the most expensive military procurement contract that the portuguese state has ever entered into . 
  if the 2006 law of military programming is to be adhered to , the purchase of the submarines will take up around 40 % of the whole budget portugal planned to dedicate for acquiring military equipment until 2023 . '', 
  eur 880 million seems quite cheap for 2 subs , ours cost over a billion each , then again they 're probably a lot better . 
  what war in the region is a possibility ? 
  i see the military industrial complex is working their magic propaganda broom on this forum . 
  neither poland nor anyone else in nato is at risk of any such war . 
  good news ? 
  this is a total waste of money . 
  i 'm not sure why you think your welfare state needs reforming , in other countries they simply strip the welfare state from the young and able and give it to the old ( if you can even call 65 old , i do n't think so ) , at least the young in france still get some value for their money . 
  it 's also not the reason unemployment is so high , which is the thing we are discussing here . 
  na , they 're still a european resource economy . 
  that 's unlikely to change i think . 
  i saw that article when i posted , it was my original source , but it seems [ those figures ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-accounts/regional-household-income/spring-2014/stb-regional-gdhi-2012.html#tab-local-area--nuts3--estimates ) are actually from 2012 !, 
  the ons seems really delayed on releasing them , they seem to come out 2 years after the fact . 
  we wo n't get 2015 figures till 2017 lol . 
  ok cool , so in future if i need to buy a car , i will look out for these day 1 used cars lol . 
  thanks , this makes sense . 
  i 'm against this decision in general but perhaps it makes sense in the case of france . 
  so it 's the car dealers buying these cars , not the car makers selling them directly , or are car dealers affiliated to car makers in some way ? 
  sorry , i 've never bought a car so do n't really know how it works . 
  why would they do this ? 
  other than the example in the op obviously lol . 
  so we have the west bombing isis to help the fsa and other moderate groups that make up the ` opposition ' . 
  we have russia bombing isis , the fsa and other moderate groups to help assad . 
  we have turkey bombing the kurdish forces fighting isis and helping isis ( unofficially ) with funding , arms and supplies across the border . 
  this war is such a clusterfuck . 
  it 's essentially a western proxy war at this point . 
  everyone is pushing their own interests , regardless of the consequences it has on the syrian people . 
  all the while this is happening soldiers are continuously changing sides , from the fsa to al-nusra ( al-qaeda ) to other groups . 
  inevitably meaning our aid will help people we do n't want it to help , and our weapons will end up in the hands of our enemies . 
  but apparently it 's a good time to get involved , ok . 
  i hope it works out , i really do , but i would n't be at all shocked to find in a few years this bites cameron in the ass . 
  i suppose he wo n't be pm at that point though , so why should he care . 
  you can read cameron 's speech to parliament on the issue yesterday [ here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/12018841/david-camerons-full-statement-calling-for-uk-involvement-in-syria-air-strikes.html ) , outlining the plan , for anyone that is interested . 
  he 's never had much support in the plp , but he is supported by the party membership . 
  sure , but it 's still used , just by using that word it should lose a fair amount of value i would think . 
  poorest city in the uk is [ leicester ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leicester ) , with an avg disposable household income ( income after taxes ) of # 11,739 pa. 
  the richest `` city '' ( these are just regions , not cities ) is westminster ( in london , where our houses of parliament are located ) with a gdhi of # 43,577 . 
  see more data [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-accounts/regional-household-income/regional-gross-disposable-household-income--gdhi--2013/stb-regional-gdhi-2013.html#tab-local-area--nuts3--gdhi-estimates ), 
  do n't they lose a shed load of money selling them second hand instead of brand new ? 
  even if they are selling them to themselves , they 're still technically used no ? 
  or can they sell them as brand new in norway ? 
  fucking areva , overpriced garbage , they 're already [ ripping us off ] ( http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/10/21/qa-how-much-are-we-paying-for-hinkley-and-who-gets-the-benefit/ ) to the price of # 81 billion !, 
  especially for turkey , it 's not like for some eastern european states where it 's difficult to buy gas from anywhere else due to infrastructure issues . 
  but as i said , what is to stop the chamber , therefore , being full of people with views that more closely align with conservative or labour ideals ? 
  it sounds to me like the best solution for what you 're after is to have parties recommend appointees and then have another committee that actually looks if their appointment serves a purpose or not ( i.e. 
  they have a specific skill insight ) . 
  [ i believe it already works like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_lords_appointments_commission ) to a certain extent although the committee perhaps does n't scrutiny appointees quite enough . 
  my main issue with the lords is the same as i have with the lower chamber , it does n't accurately represent the views of the public . 
  this would be fine , but at least one chamber should be elected under pr . 
  until that happens i 'll always support lords reform / removal . 
  mmm yes & no , i do n't believe it 's possible to have a non-political chamber , everyone is inherently political and has their own point of view . 
  if we had a non-politically aligned committee that made all decisions it may make the chamber even more party political than it already is , but in a less balanced way . 
  let 's not degrade into strawman arguments . 
  yes , actually , because as i said the vast [ majority of costs ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/aab12afa7bfe8f67fb640d0da6153279.png ) associated with the nhs are borne by those in old age . 
  so young people coming to the uk contribute via taxes but do n't take out because they rarely have to visit the hospital . 
  this reduces our dependency ratio and reduces the burden old people have on the population . 
  sure , i can agree it puts pressure on housing in certain areas . 
  but there are plenty of more fruitful ways to reduce the cost of housing that does n't mean stopping immigrants coming here . 
  most of them are coming here to fill skill gaps in employment or to study after all . 
  immigration reduces strain on the nhs , on avg they are young and do n't use its services . 
  we do n't feel their impact until 40 years later ( majority of nhs spending goes to those over 80 years old ) . 
  it 's true that immigrants will have an effect on housing but the solution to that is to build more houses !, 
  forgive me if i do n't give the government a free pass on that and just let them blame all our problems on the eu and immigration . 
  as far as unemployment is concerned it is very low , so i do n't really see that as an issue either . 
  it 's not like employment is zero sum . 
  seems more sensible to just prevent saudi funding of extremist ideologies . 
  so the catalonians want independence primarily due to tax receipt problems , but the uncertainty surrounding independence may destroy their tax receipts ? 
  sounds like the separatists may destroy the independence movement themselves . 
  hey now , we 've always been full of dirty money . 
  london is packed with russian mobsters , oligarchs , oil princes and the likes . 
  it 's how the city has always operated . 
  [ we got that covered already !, 
  ] ( http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/10/21/qa-how-much-are-we-paying-for-hinkley-and-who-gets-the-benefit/ ), 
  [ you should watch this video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zorv8wwiadq ), 
  so what you 're saying is that rich western businessmen are profiting out of poland . 
  how exactly does that help me , an ordinary citizen in the west ? 
  it 's not like these people pay corp. tax in the uk anyway , or even income tax for that matter . 
  that being said , i do have sympathy with developing countries so far as global warming is concerned . 
  i 'm not sure converting to renewables but then exporting coal elsewhere is really any better anyway . 
  just means you 're pushing your carbon footprint elsewhere , which is actually what the west has done by moving all its manufacturing abroad . 
  [ coal ccs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clean_coal ) , expensive but environmentally friendly , ish . 
  the lords is an attempt at meritocracy , but i would n't exactly call it that .
