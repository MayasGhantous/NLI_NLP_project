  of course this results in much higher costs for us , and much higher casualties . 
  with regards to syria , i do n't support troops on the ground . 
  i think somehow the west needs to get russia to agree to get rid of assad , then come to an agreement between the opposition factions & the state . 
  once that happens perhaps i could support military action under the same provisos as in iraq , if it is needed . 
  to be honest though i do n't think we should be contributing that many troops . 
  turkey borders syria & their army is far larger than ours . 
  iran too borders iraq & has a similarly large army . 
  they 're also from the region too so it would be much less of a backlash for them to sort this out than us . 
  but if it takes an international coalition to get them to provide more troops that 's ok . 
  i do n't see how it 's confusing , they even specify that they 're referring to isis . 
  also the first poll asked the question to multiple nationalities not just the french . 
  the net favourables were 7 % for uk , 2 % for germany & 16 % for france . 
  the second poll was just for the uk & had a higher favorability rating of 9 % . 
  well it was a poll of the general population not the muslim population , so it does n't suggest anything about the latter . 
  well you can make your own conclusions about the results , but there 's nothing bogus about it , you can see everything in the links i posted . 
  why does the fact it was done for rt make it a fabrication ? 
  icm are a respected polling organisation , they do polls for all the major uk newspapers frequently . 
  they 're also a member of the [ british polling council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_polling_council ) . 
  they did another poll in 2015 by the way for the uk paper the mirror . 
  [ here you can find all the data ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/data/media/pdf/new-eu-comb.pdf ) on the 2014 poll , [ as well as the 2015 poll . 
  ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/data/media/pdf/2015_mirror_isis_poll-2.pdf ), 
  yes they need to come to an agreement with russia . 
  if they agreed to get rid of assad this could all happen quite quickly . 
  if assad is gone the rebel groups could join together with the remaining government & create a new transitional government . 
  they could then work together to defeat isis with western support . 
  i do n't necessarily disagree , but people need to realise this is n't just an in & out mission . 
  for instance jeb bush was calling this morning for military action in syria & iraq to take out isis . 
  what he described was a short term mission to get the job done & then withdraw . 
  i just do n't think that 's possible , we 've already tried that multiple times . 
  we either need to go in & maintain a large occupational force or we need to leave them to it . 
  going in & blowing stuff up then withdrawing is n't going to solve anything . 
  this was a journalist from le monde , who was later shot after trying to help an american tourist into his house . 
  his statement : `` i was trying to do some work at home . 
  the tv was on , playing a cop film starring jean-hugues anglade . 
  i heard a noise which sounded like firecrackers and initially i was convinced that it was in the film . 
  but the noise was so loud , i went to the window . 
  i live on the second floor and my apartment overlooks the emergency exit of the bataclan . 
  sometimes there are evacuations [ in the past ] , but everyone was running out from all directions . 
  i saw people on the floor , and blood ... 
  i understood then that it was something serious . 
  i asked passersby what was happening . 
  everyone was running toward the rue amelot or the boulevard voltaire . 
  a woman was clinging to the window of the bataclan , on the second floor . 
  i thought of those images from september 11 . 
  so , i told myself i was going to open up to people , so they could come and take refuge . 
  therefore , i opened the door to my apartment . 
  there was a man lying on the pavement and an another man whom i did not see again , he was shot as he was trying to take shelter in the lobby . 
  that 's the moment i took a bullet . 
  i do n't remember much after that , i have a blank , but i remember feeling like a firecracker had exploded in my left arm and i saw that it was pissing blood . 
  i think the shooter was at the window of the bataclan . 
  i went up to some neighbours on the fourth floor . 
  the guy we did get in [ to the apartment ] was shot in the leg . 
  he was an american . 
  he vomited , he was cold and we thought he was going to die . 
  we called the emergency services but they could n't get us out . 
  i called a friend who is a doctor and she explained how to make a tourniquet with my shirt . 
  we were stuck in the apartment until the police raid occurred and they came to find us . '',

  edit : ** full statement ** : ** `` what happened yesterday in paris and in saint denis is an act of war and this country needs to make the right decisions to fight this war . 
  this act committed by the terrorist army , islamic state , is against who we are , against a free country that speaks to the whole world . 
  ** ** it is an act of war prepared and planned outside , with outside involvement which this investigation will seek to establish . 
  it is an act of absolute barbarism . 
  france will be ruthless in its response to islamic state . 
  ** ** at this painful and serious time , which is such a decisive one for our country , i call for unity , for a collective spirit and for cool heads . 
  i will address parliament at versailles on monday . 
  ** ** france is strong , and even if she is wounded , she will rise once again . 
  even if we are in grief , nothing will destroy her . 
  ** ** france is strong , valiant and will defeat this barbarism . 
  history reminds us of this and the strength we today bear to come together convinces us of this . 
  ** ** my compatriots , what we defend is our homeland and much more than that , it is our own values of humanity and france will bear its responsibilities . 
  guardian have a live thread [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/14/paris-terror-attacks-attackers-dead-mass-killing-live-updates ) too . 
  holy shit that 's horrible . 
  there seems to still be gunfire going on too . 
  how ? 
  the only way to solve this bullshit is by sending in troops & maintaining troops in the middle east as the allies did after ww2 . 
  are we willing to station 10s of thousands of troops inside syria & iraq for decades ? 
  because that 's what it will take . 
  [ america stationed 250,000 troops ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/703207a3d37c28c6a9fe2e7999fc2602.png ) in germany for decades for instance . 
  i do n't know the reasoning behind that , but since 9/11 there have been loads of terrorist attacks against nato members , none of which called for article 5 . 
  i mean there was that terrorist bombing that killed 30 in turkey not long ago for instance . 
  i really ca n't see there being a ground operation in syria using us / french troops . 
  if this had happened in america [ i probably would n't have this opinion ] ( http://www.pollingreport.com/isis.htm ) though , so i could be misjudging the french attitude to this . 
  edit : hollande statement : `` the french president has made an impassioned statement after the emergency security meeting this morning , where he blamed the attack on islamic state . 
  hollande said 127 people were killed in the attacks , *** which he described as an `` act of war '' . 
  *** he said the attacks were co-ordinated , planned and organised from abroad with assistance from inside france . 
  `` i pay homage to the country 's defenders who fought the terrorists yesterday , '' he said . 
  `` everyone has given their upmost and will be putting in their best efforts in the day to come . '' he called the attack `` cowardly ' and said every measure would be taken to fight `` the terrorist menace . '' `` in this most serious and uncertain time , i call for unity and courage , '' he said , adding that he would address the french parliament on monday . 
  `` even if france is wounded , she will rise , '' he said . '', 
  so who knows ? 
  perhaps this will lead to more troops on the ground ? 
  hmm looking into it further , the issue with scotland , and iceland as it happens , is their domestic liabilities . 
  the difference with somewhere like luxembourg is their banking industry is dominated by foreign banks & so if they were to get into trouble it would n't be luxembourg left with the bill . 
  for example in luxembourg total bank assets are 14 times their economy but domestic banks are only 1.5 times gdp .
