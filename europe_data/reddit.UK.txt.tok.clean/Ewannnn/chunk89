  even hong kong which seems to have one of the largest ratios is only 6 times gdp . 
  it 's not necessarily unsustainable , there are loads of small countries with comparably large banking sectors ( take luxembourg for example ) . 
  they would have struggled to provide bailouts though . 
  ireland had to do this , it resulted in a 32.4 % budget deficit in 2010 ... 
  we should have had a referendum with supermajority requirement on the lisbon treaty . 
  if it had passed ( i doubt it would without changes ) then the same requirement should have been levied to leave . 
  / u/szkwarek has a good point , this is why constitutional changes in other countries require more than just 50 % +1 . 
  perhaps next time there is major treaty change ? 
  further integration outside of existing treaties would need our approval , so this very much is a referendum on the status quo . 
  the eu is n't the uk parliament , they ca n't just unilaterally decide to do whatever the hell they want . 
  i do n't get this position from eurosceptics . 
  is your argument not strong enough that you need to make up a false premise that this is a referendum on federalisation . 
  placebo are useful to use for chronic pain relief , which is quite a big problem . 
  sure but as i said that 's better than the zero dividends you get from any private company . 
  plus you 're growing an asset , statoil has activity in other parts of the world & they have technology they 've developed . 
  this asset will potentially continue to provide the norwegian government money even after they 've ran out of oil . 
  is there any proof that homeopathic placebo is any better than non homeopathic placebo ? 
  if not , then it seems like a waste of money . 
  just use a sugar pill . 
  homeopathic pills are expensive . 
  sure , but the difference is if statoil makes # 5b profit , 67 % of that could go to the norwegian government in dividends , on top of the tax they 're paying . 
  if bp is making # 5b profit all the norwegian government gets is the tax money . 
  do n't think it 's lack of education , there are plenty of eminently educated people that believe all sorts of nonsense . 
  most of the oil is extracted by statoil , which the norwegian government has a controlling stake in . 
  but it 's true that not all is extracted by norwegian companies , you 're right . 
  you 're on rocky territory there i would think , it may be classed as hate speed due to jews being a protected class . 
  deficit spending is n't a problem that needs solving , it 's perfectly normal for most countries to run permanent deficits . 
  the exception being countries with large current account surpluses . 
  that revenue growth is normal , in the uk we saw almost exactly the same growth . 
  in 2005 revenue was # 466 billion , and in 2015 it will be # 647 billion . 
  revenue as a percentage of gdp in 2005 was 37 % , and in 2015 36 % , so it 's gone down a tad proportionally . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd want to be on top to be honest , it would mean we 're being overtaxed !, 
  to be honest i just think of scotland , and what my opinion would be if a similar thing happened in the uk . 
  if the population of the uk decides scotland should n't be independent , then scotland should n't be allowed a referendum regardless of their feelings on the matter . 
  i do n't think we should get a vote in their referendum , but it most definitely should be our decision as a country whether they get that referendum to begin with . 
  i think how it works at the moment should be changed , there should be a set procedure in place to call for a referendum . 
  i do n't like the idea the snp can just call for such a thing to happen at any time . 
  i also do n't like that such a large change can just happen via 51 % of the vote , i think it should be higher than that , perhaps 66 % . 
  such requirements are good to stop tyranny of the majority & minor fluctuations in popular opinion . 
  yea i would n't be opposed to that . 
  a lot of companies on the continent are controlled in that way , be it energy companies or transport . 
  in the uk we seem to have a government that is just completely against state ownership of anything if they can avoid it . 
  of course they have no issue with foreign state owned enterprises competing in our markets though , just domestically owned ones . 
  i do n't know , his comment has a `` controversial '' icon & it 's on one point . 
  your score seems to suggest people agree with you & at the same time disagree with him , which is strange . 
  how accurate are the french responses ? 
  as a french person would you be in the 3rd column , the second column or a bit of both ? 
  just make yourself at home, 
  haha not directly no , but the added pressure could help indirectly . 
  could n't that be a positive for us , pushing more people towards le pen , who also wants changes in the eu . 
  cameron wants to stay , he ca n't ask for too much . 
  even what he 's asking for is said to be impossible . 
  d ) any post positive about refugees / immigration is either in negative karma already or is `` controversial '' & well on its way . 
  the levy they charge oil companies above others is 30 % . 
  aside from that it 's just corp. tax that everyone else pays ( to be precise corp. tax is 20 % + 10 % surcharge for oil companies , on top of 20 % levy ) . 
  i do n't know what they use the profit for , the dividend they pay may not be very large & most of the money may well go back into investment . 
  if that 's the case it 's not such a bad deal . 
  uk levy is 30 % as far as i can see , that 's a 20 % levy plus an extra 10 % on corp. tax . 
  irelands overall will be lower though because their corp. tax is lower . 
  total taxation for uk oil is 50 % including corp. tax . 
  of course , they do n't own the land , [ this tax is just a fee ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f7c583e4-cd71-11e4-a15a-00144feab7de.html ) to allow them to extract our oil . 
  also for new fields the fee is 20 % , including corp. tax it is 50 % . 
  for older fields the fee is 35 % , so 65 % total . 
  i still do n't understand why we do n't drill the oil ourselves like the norwegians do , if we did that we would n't lose 50 % of the profit to foreign oil company shareholders ... 
  of course they are , otherwise they would be drilling our oil for free . 
  i still do n't see why the tax rate is n't higher than it is , the margin the government provides seems far too high . 
  they 're essentially giving away our oil reserves for ~ 30 % of the profit . 
  the only thing that hampers eu democracy is voter apathy towards the institution . 
  the way it 's set up however , is arguably better than many eu parliamentary systems as you point out . 
  the uk will whine about unaccountability while blocking steps to make the commission more accountable . 
  it 's the uk way . 
  the eu is a boon for uk politicians , if the eu does something good claim responsibility , if they do something bad just blame it on `` unelected bureaucrats in brussels '' . 
  even without dublin they could just refuse entry as far as i 'm aware . 
  these people do n't have travel documents , sweden is under no obligation to just let them pass . 
  what sort of affect is this likely to have on portugal 's deficit agreement with the eu ? 
  are there any new projections for where you 'll be by the end of this year ? 
  looking at [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_fiscal_compact#fiscal_compliance ) you 're suppose to reach -0.5 % structural balance in 2015 . 
  then again france is suppose to miss their targets too , i 'm not sure the eu will do anything about it . 
  what ? 
  the question has nothing to do with  whether they have a somewhat favorable view of the islamic state of iraq or isis the question was  from what you know , please , tell me if you have a very favorable , somewhat favorable , somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of the islamic state of iraq and the levant otherwise known as isis ? 
  as in my op  another poll [ 2 ] by icm in 2014 found that in france 16 % of the population had a favourable view of isis, 
  what do you mean exactly ? 
  what 's not clear about the question ? 
  no , the actual question was `` from what you know , please , tell me if you have a very favorable , somewhat favorable , somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of the *** islamic state of iraq and the levant otherwise known as isis *** ? '', 
  it 's not all that surprising , [ a poll carried out ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/muslim-leader-isis-supporting-brits-disenfranchised-6018357 ) by icm in britain for the mirror recently found that 9 % of those polled had a somewhat favourable view of isis . 
  considering the uk muslim population in the uk is only ~ 5 % of the population this means that they have a not insignificant support from the non-muslim population . 
  [ another poll ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/data/media/pdf/new-eu-comb.pdf ) by icm in 2014 found that *** in france 16 % of the population had a favourable view of isis *** , peaking at 27 % in the 18-24 age demographic . 
  so these results show that the opinions of syrian refugees are n't all that dissimilar to that of the uk or french population . 
  edit : [ first poll in question . 
  ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/data/media/pdf/2015_mirror_isis_poll-2.pdf ), 
  [ when polled ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/10/17/very-british-coup/ ) 9 % of the uk population said they would rather a military dictatorship than labour ( our center left party ) in power . 
  when polling people you can usually get a not insignificant number to wish for anything . 
  at least that 's my experience from looking at polls over the years ... edit : also [ a poll ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/muslim-leader-isis-supporting-brits-disenfranchised-6018357 ) conducted in the uk by icm found that 9 % of the uk population had a favourable opinion of isis . 
  so this figure for the syrian refugees is not all that different . 
  [ another poll ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/data/media/pdf/new-eu-comb.pdf ) by icm in 2014 i should note found that in france 16 % of the population had a favourable view of isis , so even larger than the poll in the op . 
  as i said , you can always find some idiots in any population . 
  such people are not necessarily immigrants , if you look at the proportion of foreign national prisoners ( i.e. 
  immigrants ) , in 2011 it was 13 % compared with 12 % in the general population , so almost the same . 
  jesus i knew it was bad in america , but [ that 's just ridiculous . 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/1ea368e195c39b01ef9b454e016f0c87.png ) lot of interesting data in that briefing though !,
