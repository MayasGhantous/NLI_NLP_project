  of note : * `` 47 % of the prisoner sample held no academic qualifications . 
  in 2003 , the proportion of the population of working age in the uk holding no qualifications was 15 % . 
  '' * * `` approximately 5 % of prisoners were educated to a level higher than a levels , including 3 % who held university degrees . 
  in 2003 around 16 % of the uk working age population held a degree . '', 
  * `` 24 % of prisoners had lived with foster parents or in an institution , or had been taken into care at some point when they were a child . 
  '' * * `` 29 % of prisoners had experienced emotional , physical or sexual abuse as a child . 
  with women ( 53 % ) more likely to have experienced such abuse than men ( 27 % ) '' * *** `` 41 % of prisoners had observed violence at home as a child . 
  '' *** also # of women that commit crimes is * really * low , only 4.6 % of the prison population was female in 2013 . 
  translated ( although i guess anyone in those countries can probably read this already ) * `` on saturday , november 7th , 2015 to 10:00 , xhemile tahir , an elderly lady of 52 years , left the hospital on foot ` the clearing ' ( la clairi\u00e8re ) located in bertrix . 
  since then , she has not been heard from .

  '' * good luck !, 
  the economy of greece does n't need to be similar to france or germany , they just need fiscal transfers like any federation to fix any disparities . 
  the ez should and will end up having different institutions . 
  so then the eu can stay as it is politically and if people want to integrate further they join the ez and do so that way . 
  two speed europe makes sense for both sides , it stops britain vetoing every step of integration . 
  are you sure we 're not most generous including public aid too ? 
  we 're like 5th highest in the world as a percentage if gdp as i recall , second highest in total value . 
  well this video is certainly objective & balanced ... 
  only in scotland iirc . 
  nationalism . 
  polls during october & november put her between 10 & 16 points above every other party , with an average for october of 13 . 
  not really flying away is the answer . 
  [ merkel & her party are doing just fine ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/b35aa580e2bf133cd2cd602098868153.png ) . 
  politicians in my country would kill for numbers like hers . 
  this is n't true , denmark can set their own interest rates for instance . 
  it 's true that they have much less freedom than a free floating currency , but they 're not as restricted as being inside the euro . 
  no doubt this was at a football match we probably lost . 
  in parliamentary systems usually the party decides on a pm before the election i think . 
  the exception of course is in countries with regular coalitions but even then it 's going to be the leader of one of the coalition parties . 
  if the pm steps down before an election of course it is the governing party ( s ) that decide on a new pm . 
  in presidential systems of course you elect your executive head directly . 
  this is a good point . 
  just auction certain routes with subsidies that mean decent profit , then pick the company that can do it for the cheapest price . 
  expensive to do but no more so than doing it for domestic companies . 
  esl do some testing now i think , but i agree it will be good when all these big events have anti doping measures . 
  well napoleon did bring about [ fundamental changes in both france & in all the countries he conquered ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleonic_code ) , changes that still remain in place today . 
  so yes , in many ways he did institute a new era of liberty in continental europe . 
  for the time it did , social barriers were broken & anyone could be successful ( well to a certain extent comparably to other royalist countries , obviously opportunity was nothing compared to today ) as opposed to only the aristocracy . 
  whether he 's correct or not , that 's not a reason to downvote someone anyway . 
  it 's not a disagreement button people . 
  the police & security services are trained to deal with this . 
  think the fbi in america or mi5 in the uk , we also have specially armed police divisions too ( swat in the usa for instance ) . 
  i mean you are american you must realise this , your police deal with heavily armed gangs every day , but it is not an excuse to have soldiers on the streets . 
  that makes it even worse !, 
  it 's a bit of a pet peeve of mine , because my brother & father have a habit of using ginger all the time in their drinks . 
  so the grater & chopping board always have ginger on them . 
  this means often any sandwiches i make taste of ginger , which is totally disgusting , unless i thoroughly rewash everything ( they ca n't wash stuff to save their life ) before using it . 
  basically i hate it when there is a flavour in something that should n't be there . 
  fish juice is especially the worst , if my sandwich ever tasted of that i 'd have to throw it away !, 
  this is my father 's excuse for leaving rotting chicken carcases in the lower oven ( he forgets they 're there ) as well as cutting raw meat on the same chopping board that we later use to chop vegetables on among other things !, 
  that being said , my concern for your washing habits has more to do with the chance of taste transfer than hygiene . 
  for instance if you make something really fishy the fish juice will get all over the plates . 
  the next time you eat a dessert on said plate it may taste of fish !, 
  lol i am not convinced , i think i agree with the op it 's not something us foreigners can understand !, 
  but then all the film & non solid gunk gets on all your dishes ?!?!, 
  what if you happen to use a recipe that uses lots of oil for instance . 
  or even worse something like fish juice !, 
  but the water in the sink has gunk all over it lol . 
  of course not but the people drawing it are still arseholes . 
  i 'd never respect someone that feels they need to be purposefully confrontational in that way . 
  to be honest the people that create ch just seem like arseholes . 
  why would you create a comic to purposefully antagonise people and make fun of tragedy . 
  horrible magazine . 
  wow til, 
  surely all the dishes have bits of dried food stuck to them if you do n't rinse ? 
  i do it this way too . 
  right handed . 
  this came up in wednesdays pmqs ( prime ministers questions ) so the uk may give help too , although it does n't seem like it 's needed really . 
  well i 'm english , you can probably tell my opinion of the euro purely based on that . 
  sure i agree with you if it had been sold that way to the people . 
  but if it had been the euro would never have been created . 
  i do n't blame countries in the north for being pissed & playing hardball with greece , that 's what their population want . 
  they never expected to have to bail out these people . 
  why would that be a positive ? 
  the commission is elected by the parliament , and they can recall the commission too . 
  if you restrict the executive to elected officials you greatly restrict the candidate pool & may not get the best person for the job . 
  sure but america is a country , the eurozone is not . 
  living in london i would n't whine about propping up the north east , because we 're both british at the end of the day . 
  but i would be pissed if i had to subsidize another country , especially if they were substantially poorer than myself when joining the union . 
  but yes , this is a fatal flaw with the eurozone unfortunately . 
  something people obviously did n't think much about before creating it . 
  sure for france i agree the deficit is totally not a huge issue , i was referring to greece . 
  the problem is , it 's someone else that has to pay for it . 
  the greeks also had massive deficits even before the crash so they do n't really have anyone else to blame but themselves . 
  the main issue for greece & other eurozone countries is they do n't have their own currency & their own central bank . 
  this makes it fairly feasible that they could run out of money & go bankrupt . 
  for most countries that control their own currency they can just create more money if need be & this mostly eliminates the prospect of default . 
  another important point to note is that demand for government bonds pushes down yields . 
  if you 're an investor that holds euros & you want to invest in european bonds you have a lot of options , whereas if you 're say a japanese investor & want to invest in yen your only option is japanese bonds . 
  this is why bonds in places like germany have such low yields , investors in greek debt & other less stable countries are ploughing their money into german bonds because they 're more safe . 
  if greece had their own currency they ( the investors ) would n't have that option , plus local institutions have a shared interest in making sure the government remains solvent . 
  people south wo n't be in favour & the reason is because of this : * `` in the republic , the overall support for a reunited ireland dropped to 31 % `` if it meant paying more tax '' . 
  '' * northern ireland is poor , and the gap is growing larger every year . 
  gva per capita for n. ireland in 2013 was [ # 17,948 ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-accounts/regional-gross-value-added--income-approach-/december-2014/stb-regional-gva-dec-2014.html#tab-summary ) , the 3rd lowest for any region in the uk . 
  growth per head between 2012 & 2013 was 0.9 % the lowest of any region . 
  the republic of ireland on the other hand is rich , at least on average , much more so even than the uk . 
  this gap is likely to get larger , and northern ireland will just fall further behind .
