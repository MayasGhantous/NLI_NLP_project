  probably the biggest political story of the week in the uk is that of the government 's tax credits debacle being [ voted down in the house of lords . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34631156 ) this has been a political nightmare for the conservatives since it was put forward , even right wing newspapers & think tanks have been calling for the government to put in more protections for the poorest workers . 
  these are n't just minor cuts either , some people will lose 20 % or more of their income due to the changes , with [ the average for the lowest two deciles being 6 % & 7.5 % ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/c1b658d6ec1f3fd21323fa98152b8e43.png ) respectfully . 
  the biggest issue is david cameron suggesting before the election , as well as many other cabinet ministers categorically stating , that they would not cut tax credits . 
  but then they went back on this & put the proposal before parliament under what 's called a [ statutory instrument ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statutory_instrument_\\ ( uk \\ ) ) . 
  what this means is that the proposal is n't dealt with in the usual way through parliament , it is only voted on once & then passed to the house of lords . 
  no amendments are allowed to be made , and proper scrutiny is not given . 
  regular bills go through a [ much longer process ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/ ) of debate , multiple votes & scrutiny in committee stage . 
  the house of lords of course is unelected . 
  so they have some conventions & rules they have to follow . 
  the two in particular to this case is the [ salisbury convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salisbury_convention ) & the [ parliament acts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliament_acts_1911_and_1949 ) . 
  basically the hol will not vote down legislation that was in the ruling party 's election manifesto , or vote down money bills . 
  however because this was neither a bill , nor a money bill , nor in the conservatives manifesto they felt well within their rights to reject it . 
  of course the government is annoyed , and has made a bit of a fuss over it , but it will probably not amount to much as they themselves have benefitted quite nicely to how the hol works . 
  their contention is that this proposal is a money raising change , and thus should not be rejected by the unelected upper house due to previous convention . 
  obviously the house did n't find this to be the case , which is why they felt it ok to vote it down . 
  so now the government has to think again , and come up with new proposals that protect people currently on tax credits . 
  some say they 've dodged a bullet because this proposal was totally toxic from the outset . 
  i guess we 'll have to see what they come up with . 
  the economist has an [ interesting article ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/02/economist-explains-16 ) on why road deaths are so small in sweden . 
  the [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right-_and_left-hand_traffic#safety_factors ) just has this to note : * `` research in 1969 by j. j. leeming showed that countries driving on the left have a lower collision rate than countries driving on the right , although he acknowledged that the sample of left-hand rule countries he had to work with was small , and he was very careful not to claim that his results proved that the differences were due to the rule of the road . 
  it has been suggested that this is partly because humans are more commonly right-eye dominant than left-eye dominant . 
  in left-hand traffic , the predominantly better-performing right eye is used to monitor oncoming traffic and the driver 's wing mirror ( side mirror ) . 
  in right-hand traffic , oncoming traffic and the driver 's wing mirror are handled by the predominantly weaker left eye . 
  in addition , it has been argued that left-sided driving is safer for elderly people given the likelihood of their having visual attention deficits on the left side and the need at intersections to watch out for vehicles approaching on the nearside lane . 
  furthermore , in an rhd car with manual transmission , the driver has the right hand , which for most people is dominant , on the steering wheel at all times and uses the left hand ( and left foot ) to change gears and operate most other controls . 
  * * cyclists , motorcyclists and horse riders typically mount from the left-hand side , with motorcycle side stands almost always located on the left . 
  this places them on the kerb when driving on the left . 
  i do n't think so , at least not for the uk / germany . 
  even taking [ un population projections ] ( http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/dataquery/ ) for 2050 & dividing by the gdp on the wiki does n't give the same result ( using that method would give ~ 113k gdp per capita in 2050 for germany ) . 
  i do n't think the data is from the wiki article , i think it 's a projection from elsewhere . 
  these long term projections tend to be very very different depending upon who 's making them . 
  they 're basically just guesses that far into the future after all . 
  yes i saw that but as you said that 's not per capita , i just wondered where you got the figures you actually posted from . 
  did you use the pwc estimates combined with population figures from elsewhere ? 
  can you source it , i ca n't find imf projections past 2020 . 
  i presume these are imf projections ? 
  finally accepting that english is the defacto european language ? 
  good to know !, 
  just do n't tell the french !, 
  so it seems baranie rogi is 2526m tall to give some perspective . 
  cool picture op . 
  hate speech should be for no one . 
  any loss of seats from akp would be a good thing , that 's what i 'm hoping to see as an outsider . 
  the fact akp get so many votes just tells you how far the country still needs to come to be accepted in europe ... 
  haha almost made me spit out my coffee . 
  this is my favourate one yet , cheers op !, 
  uk does n't have that much power , and increasingly this will become the case as the emu integrates further . 
  i suspect they 'll probably create an ez parliament where most decisions will be made , so it will be a german / french show really . 
  uk power is just through our potential to veto certain decisions but other smaller countries have that power too . 
  haha it 's more the lack of personal space !, 
  everyone is so jammed together !, 
  i 'd be cutting up the grass path , screw that traffic jam !, 
  what is it with conservatives & surveillance ? 
  good job aldi / s&d / greens / enf on voting for this & getting it through parliament . 
  [ see the vote in question here ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-follow-up-to-the-european-parliament-resolution-of-12-march-2014-on-the-electronic-mass-surveillance.html ) ( registration required i believe ) also i thought ukip were calling themselves a libertarian party these days . 
  if that 's the case why are they voting against this ? 
  why are they voting against the first amendment in particular that pertains to the uk ? 
  deplores the uk 's adoption of the data retention and investigatory powers act ( dripa ) 2014 , which not only allows intelligence and security services to continue with bulk data retention mechanisms after the court of justice ruling declaring directive 2006/24/ec invalid , but also extends the territorial reach of their interception powers ; stresses the importance of the uk high court 's ruling in the case of david davis and others v secretary of state for the home department , in which the high court ruled that dripa 2014 in its current form was unlawful because of a lack of safeguards which was inconsistent with eu law , while giving the uk government nine months to introduce the appropriate safeguards ; welcomes , in this connection , the report by the uk independent reviewer of terrorism legislation which calls for a complete overhaul of the uk 's surveillance laws , judicial oversight of the interception of private communications , and greater transparency regarding the existence and use of surveillance powers ; calls on the uk government to take duly into account the report 's recommendations ; '' * seems the only uk meps that voted for it were the greens & aldi . 
  to be honest it 's not just inflation but that is the primary reason . 
  i do n't think credit rating really makes any difference though as long as it 's investment grade . 
  credit rating would make more of a difference between countries within the eurozone since they all share the same currency & investors can easily invest in german bonds instead of greek ones . 
  for uk investors it 's not so easy because their money is in gbp . 
  no it 's not but historically it has been over the last 5 years been around 2 % higher & bond yields do n't just decrease over night . 
  that 's not due to our credit rating . 
  it 's mostly due to higher inflation . 
  this is almost 1/3rd of google 's total revenue , on which they made an operating profit of $ 16 billion & net profit of $ 14 billion . 
  sure , but it 's not worth losing our privacy over . 
  i mean jesus christ , the amount of people that get killed or injured from terror attacks is absolutely minute . 
  it is nothing to be scared of , and we need to stop letting the government get away with constantly more authoritarian powers in the name of `` safety '' . 
  establishment parties vote for establishment policies that benefit large businesses . 
  not really surprising . 
  you 're assuming a link while still in office , as i said if a link can be proven then obviously there is a conflict of interest . 
  but let 's not just assume there is a link purely due to post political work circumstances . 
  well not necessarily , as i said there is always someone that benefits from government decisions , and so there is always someone that perhaps feels gratitude towards certain government officials . 
  it could just be that your beliefs align with the goals of certain companies . 
  the key question is whether they made those decisions for the right reasons . 
  if there is no evidence of nefarious intent then there is nothing wrong here . 
  at the end of the day when you 're in government your decisions are always going to be good for someone somewhere , it does n't mean you 're corrupt . 
  what else are they suppose to do , stay unemployed ? 
  this . 
  also the cost for * everyone * will be huge if we do n't limit global warming to a 2c rise by 2100 . 
  we 'll need much more rapid change to do that as well , even these targets are no where near enough . 
  that 's only due to freedom of movement , without that i doubt anyone would care . 
  the british government would n't accept it without limits on immigration . 
  no but the uk gave scotland permission to have a referendum . 
  as a uk citizen i would n't support scottish independence if they decided to have their own referendum & try to leave the union without the support of westminster . 
  let the scottish people decide , but no unilateral withdrawals should be allowed . 
  if the british people do n't want to give scotland a referendum , if the government decides it 's not the right time , then that is the matter closed as far as i 'm concerned . 
  for example , the snp is constantly threatening to have a new referendum , and if they wanted to have one next year i would n't support that , and i may vote for a different pm if the current one did so . 
  does n't your last sentence basically sum up the purpose of ukip in the eu parliament ? 
  we 're not an exporting nation though ( that is our balance of trade is negative ) , it 's more important to have a stronger currency so that our imports are cheaper . 
  another point to note , most businesses are not going to want to deal with russia 's local currency . 
  the ruble is garbage & is fluctuating hugely , having the currency on your books is far too risky . 
  they will demand russian exporters sell their products in usd or eur . 
  a programme using your system for nefarious purposes . 
  so for instance it may inject advertisements into your browsing , or it may turn your computer into a spam machine ( all those spam emails & phishing attempts often come from botnets ) , or it may use your system to do a ddos attack or other serious attacks .

  it does sometimes still work though , probably depends if your ip is on a list of known vpn providers . 
  the problem is netflix puts hard coded subs in some foreign jurisdictions , there is no way to remove them .
