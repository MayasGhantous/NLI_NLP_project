  this is annoying if you happen to speak english .

  it 's actually not that old ( created in the 70s ) but the contrast is pretty cool i think . 
  i do n't trust them to use them , i do n't even trust my own government to either & i would hope that they did n't . 
  that does n't matter , all that matters from a mad perspective is that the chance is there . 
  annihilation is annihilation whether the chance is 1 % or 100 % it makes little difference . 
  well everyone else is , does n't make sense to have overlap , just wasted money . 
  i was told today that apparently pis are pro welfare , pro market intervention , so kinda opposite to thatcher in that regard . 
  they 're more like conservative populists . 
  no it 's not , nato still has a permanent at sea deterrent without the uk . 
  we already have a deterrent , it 's called nato . 
  it seems politics is n't quite as straightforward in poland as in the uk in that case lol . 
  this sounds more populist to me . 
  [ but they 're for economic interventionism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_and_justice ) , that 's very much a left wing economic philosophy . 
  it 's k , the tories do n't mind about allying themselves with [ unsavory ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/3ff9a4f0c04010cc15b291d9d2885195.jpg ) [ characters ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/db848f69df4ce6e7baead6178322eab5.jpg ) . 
  ditch trident , spend the money on military equipment we actually use plus more troops . 
  such that we do n't run out of bullets & our rockets do n't randomly break off from our planes mid flight . 
  would allow us to contribute much more to nato operations & have better defense all round . 
  the germans & everyone else in europe must think we 're crazy for investing so much in a weapon we 'll never use ... 
  meanwhile our conventional armed forces crumble due to lack of funding . 
  do n't integrate further into the eu , do n't leave the eu , ditch trident & invest the money in weapons we actually use . 
  as i recall the adjusted cost is # 5 billion per year , that 's almost enough to buy two aircraft carriers every year . 
  haha i meant more from a re-negotiation standpoint , pis are more in tune with reducing the power of the eu & bringing more back to the individual countries . 
  this is good for the uk ... 
  i think ? 
  pis are in the same eu group as the uk conservatives & are mildly eurosceptic . 
  poland is seriously right wing though jesus , the left wing parties get almost no votes at all . 
  i was looking up pis , are n't they left on economics , right on social issues , and i 'm guessing authoritarian ? 
  this is good for the uk ... 
  i think ? 
  pis are in the same eu group as the uk conservatives & are mildly eurosceptic . 
  it 's from the [ income database ] ( http://topincomes.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/#database: ) created by piketty & saez among others . 
  the only thing it does n't include is income from the government , but that 's way higher in europe than in america anyway . 
  i was n't talking about the bottom 10 % , i was talking about * everyone below the top 10 % . 
  * disposable incomes in america are high because they 've always been high , but they 're comparably much lower now than they were 40 years ago . 
  as i said , the income on average for the bottom 90 % of americans has n't changed at all in over 50 years . 
  the same phenomenon has n't happened in europe , where wage growth is way more balanced . 
  why should most people give a shit about wealth creation if that is not transferred to them ? 
  income for most people in america has stagnated for decades . 
  adjusting for inflation the average wage of the bottom 90 % of earners in america is less than it was in 1968 . 
  over the same time period the income of the top 10 % has increased by 84 % & for the top 1 % 267 % . 
  the dalai lama was in britain a few weeks ago ... 
  indeed , screw those sheep farmers in the shetlands that justify this clock change . 
  justifying a system that benefits a few farmers over the rest is idiotic . 
  yes i saw the same image , although i did n't save it at the time . 
  this one suggests that it may be released prior to signing although it 's not clear whether it 's released to the public . 
  once it 's introduced to congress it will , however this is the last 90 days as i said . 
  the time between release & presentation to congress is the only unknown as far as i can see , the legislative schedule ca n't be longer than 90 days . 
  i agree it may well be 9 months , but it could also be as short as 90 days . 
  [ read here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fast_track_\\ ( trade \\ ) #procedure ), 
  really ? 
  tpp legislative schedule is 60-90 days as i recall , why would ttip be any longer . 
  but as i said , it was a new treaty , not a change to current treaties . 
  so for instance the eurozone could set up a new parliament if they wanted , and integrate further , but they could n't do it through the eu institutions without our approval . 
  see more [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_fiscal_compact#ratification_and_implementation ) , of note : * `` originally eu leaders planned to change existing eu treaties but this was blocked by british prime minister david cameron , who demanded that the city of london be excluded from future financial regulations , including the proposed eu financial transaction tax , thus a separate treaty was then envisaged , outside the formal eu institutions , as it had been with the first schengen treaty in 1985 . 
  '' * i guess it would be more correct to say we can prevent the eu as an organisation from federalisation , but we ca n't stop constituent countries that want to do so outside of the eu institutions . 
  what treaty are you referring to ? 
  if it was a change to a current treaty the veto should kill it i believe ( we 'd have to ratify it for it to come into force ) . 
  they could go ahead anyway but it would have to be a new treaty , they could n't adjust existing eu treaties . 
  that 's not the case in all democracies - see switzerland . 
  i 'm not sure about that , if we voted to leave they may come groveling to give us exceptions like they have in the past . 
  but i have a feeling cameron will only get superficial changes , we 'll vote to stay , and little will change . 
  that 's false , as we have overall veto just like every other country . 
  it 's in your best interest to give us opt outs . 
  i actually do n't know why cameron is doing this now , just wait till there is treaty change & then we have massive bargaining power . 
  and this is just a few crazies you ( or someone else ) chose at random i guess ? 
  there must be thousands of candidates i suppose . 
  we have quite [ a lot of crazies ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/c223822246668275041101d6e8fa3343.png ) at the general election here too . 
  damn poor guy . 
  you could say his fortune is almost limitless in real terms as he controls entirety of russia . 
  haha this is fantastic . 
  are there elections all over bulgaria or is this for one town in particular ? 
  ca n't say i 'm pleased about the geo-default or the massive influx of users . 
  however great survey , i love these sorts of things , and i 'll be eagerly waiting for the result !, 
  it 's especially good as all the comments are deleted lol . 
  yes but the idea does n't specify how large that ubi would be . 
  they could have a nit based around any top rate of tax , for instance say 10 % , which is much lower than what is currently paid . 
  for instance in the uk the average cash benefit across all households is # 6k , and the lowest paid receive on average # 9k . 
  if you add on other benefits like the nhs & education that 's another # 7k on average & # 8k for the lowest earners . 
  so the payoff would have to be quite large , much larger than what they 're talking about in america . 
  the amount given through a bank giveaway would be considerably less than that given through qe . 
  my guess is they would go for a conservative amount & spread it over many months so they can judge the effects . 
  no doubt in germany it would just result in more saving !, 
  austerity fetishism is the problem here , it 's a new thing in the uk but germany has had this problem since forever as far as i 'm aware . 
  both states have instituted fiscal rules now to force permanent surpluses , it 's totally bonkers . 
  means that borrowing to invest shortly will be impossible . 
  they could be cautious with the amount , and if it leads to large amounts of inflation we have standard monetary tools to deal with that . 
  these permanent low interest rates are really dangerous too , they need to start rising slowly . 
  edit : another option is people 's qe & similar ideas ( i 'm referring to infrastructure investment programmes here ) . 
  then again germany in particular could easily fund this sort of programme through borrowing , that could surely be used to push up inflation . 
  [ german investment is currently falling far short of where it needs to be , and this is dragging everyone down . 
  ] ( http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/more-investment-germany%e2%80%99s-sake ) uk has this problem too , thanks conservatives !, 
  helicopter money . 
  let all consumers benefit instead of primarily speculators & the asset rich wealthy . 
  nice link thanks for sharing . 
  looks like the danish & finnish are most aligned with what we want , but with most countries it 's going to be difficult . 
  i support the idea , but only if it gives people an acceptable amount of money . 
  i do n't support the silly suggestions many american politicians come up with , which are essentially just ways to give rich people more money . 
  it would have to be proper redistribution , more than we currently have . 
  current gen reactors are safe in the uk to be honest , but i do n't think some people will ever be convinced .
