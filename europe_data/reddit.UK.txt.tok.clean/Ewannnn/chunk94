  they 'll always see chernobyl when they think of nuclear . 
  anti-nuclear sentiment is n't that high in the uk i think . 
  i mean there 's always going to be a certain amount of people worried about them blowing up , but the government is quite keen on the technology . 
  hinkley point c is to replace reactors going offline in the 2020s , it does n't add any ` new ' capacity . 
  that 's kinda why they have to build it now . 
  if we did n't , we 'd need to replace those power stations with something else , probably coal or gas i guess which are n't really better . 
  this is just pfi , and almost no one thinks that was a good idea . 
  as with most governments , they 're just pushing the payment off the government books . 
  but it will cost us all way way way more in the end . 
  yes let 's use private financing for nuclear , and pay for it with higher energy prices , instead of the government borrowing at almost zero rates to pay for it themselves . 
  this private financing of infrastructure is totally bonkers . 
  what 's more this is n't even private financing , it 's the chinese state , so there is really no excuse not to borrow even from ideological reasons . 
  it 's actually the [ complete opposite ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/25/erdogan-plan-for-super-presidency-puts-turkeys-democracy-at-stake ) , the current presidential position is ceremonial , but he wants to move towards a presidential system similar to america where the president has ultimate power over domestic & foreign affairs . 
  if they stick with having a pm i guess this would be similar to the french system ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  the guardian article suggests it would be similar to russia . 
  edit : ah i see , [ he 's referring to the queen in the literal sense ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/erdogan-president-turkey-queen-in-charge-uk ) . 
  in the way that the queen actually has massive constitutional powers except in the uk system by procedure she does n't use them . 
  for example technically speaking the queen appoints the prime minister , the queen writes all bills into law , but in reality she has no power over either of these things . 
  also what the fuck this article is from january . 
  disappointing stats for germany , denmark & to a lesser extent uk , ireland & netherlands . 
  eastern european countries have some excuse due to being poor ( estonia is kinda outrageous though ) . 
  really we should have gone down the french route decades ago . 
  eu should dump structural funds into renewables in eastern europe perhaps ? 
  well yes & no , we do n't need any added sugars in our diet at all . 
  also it 's not really that simple , the effect of certain foods are very different & how we digest them is very different ( see [ here ] ( http://authoritynutrition.com/6-reasons-why-a-calorie-is-not-a-calorie/ ) & [ here ] ( http://authoritynutrition.com/debunking-the-calorie-myth/ ) ) . 
  but yea moderation is key , it 's just more difficult with some foods over others . 
  yea true but the hfcs that is 90 % fructose is n't really used , the stuff you find in drinks & food could be 55 % ( worse for you ) or 42 % ( better for you ) fructose . 
  also the problem with fructose in food is the stupid low fat diets that are still peddled in supermarkets & have been since the late 70s . 
  when people finally start to realise that fat is n't the boogeyman people once thought it was , and that sugar is the real issue , we 'll probably find less of it in our food . 
  i would n't be surprised if a few years from now we start seeing a lot more low sugar foods with normal amounts of fat . 
  instead of low fat the package will say low sugar instead . 
  edit : [ read this for a more indepth explanation & sources . 
  ] ( http://authoritynutrition.com/high-fructose-corn-syrup-vs-sugar/ ), 
  from a health perspective there 's not really any difference between hfcs & regular sugar . 
  they 're both a glucose fructose mix & equally bad for you . 
  i agree . 
  i believe in small government but with high wealth redistribution . 
  i think decisions should be taken more locally and political parties should have to work together in coalition rather than opposition . 
  so saudi becomes friend with russia instead ? 
  it 's a sad reality but we ca n't just not do business with the world , there are a lot of fucked up countries out there . 
  better that they 're in our sphere than someone worse . 
  well the people on average in greece will be richer than those in china put it that way . 
  has she ? 
  i mean i accept it 's probably a given , as the uk would n't accepted accession otherwise , but i have n't see this written anywhere . 
  [ this is data from 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) & would place turkey as the 2nd poorest country in the eu ( by gdp per capita ppp ) were they to join today . 
  sure , but only with restricted freedom of movement . 
  turkey would be the second largest country in the eu by population as well as the second poorest by gdp per capita ( ppp ) . 
  this would be problematic from an immigration standpoint . 
  i would n't want to see the eu budget go up though due to this . 
  that does n't surprise me , most parties like that [ do the same thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vblgg5ugekw&amp;t=1m21s ) . 
  i suppose people in switzerland are perhaps not that bothered though as they 're already pretty well off anyway ? 
  [ svp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_people%27s_party ) . 
  i did n't realise the swiss were so conservative . 
  edit : i have just been reading about your government system ( [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_federal_council ) & [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_assembly_\\ ( switzerland \\ ) ) ) . 
  it 's pretty fascinating , seems like a really good method of democracy . 
  it seems this election is unlikely to change much except the bdp possibly losing their council seat to the svp . 
  policy could slant more to the right as well since the left wing parties lost quite a few seats . 
  i love the idea of power sharing within government though , i can imagine it makes everything much more consistent . 
  allows politicians to plan more for the long term i would think ? 
  rather than only thinking in 5 year cycles . 
  as i understand it diesel cars have lower co2 emissions , so in that sense it has n't been a disaster . 
  as i heard it put recently , we 're trading future benefit for cost in health today . 
  they 're similar to apple in many ways , and the hype surrounding elon is similar to that given to steve jobs . 
  we see it all the time with apple , they 'll release a new product & people ( not people on reddit these days though ) will call it ` revolutionary ' despite these ideas not being new at all . 
  we saw it with ` autopilot ' on the new model s the other day , people going on about how crazy & new the technology is , despite other car companies ( mercedes for instance ) having released similar technology for years . 
  this is nonsense , all 28 eu member states will get to debate the deal before it is finalised in their respective parliaments & it will have to pass unanimously . 
  it will also have to pass the eu council & eu parliament . 
  europe is more than capable of defending itself without america . 
  also eu states are indeed wanting to be friendly with russia , there 's no profit in animosity . 
  i doubt any country west of poland sees russia as any sort of adversary in reality . 
  any country with a military worth anything is already in nato though , who carry out joint operations . 
  unless you 're referring to proper collective procurement , training & chain of command , in which case we have language problems & issues around sovereignty . 
  also it would n't be the nation states commanding the army it would be the commission , i.e. 
  i think we 've probably got a while away before people commit their foreign policy to the commission . 
  the nation states are always resisting giving more power to the eu executive . 
  lack of proper training i guess , that or they do things differently in bulgaria to most countries ... 
  i 'm guessing the latter considering no disciplinary measures . 
  this * will happen again * unless procedure is changed , perhaps next time it will be a guard being shot instead of a foreigner . 
  [ for anyone wondering .

  [ install gyazo ] ( https://gyazo.com/ ) , it makes posting images online * way way easier . 
  as i recall it 's in the tibetan constitution that they must consult and consider the dalai lama 's opinion when making decisions . 
  in practice he still has a lot of sway even if it 's democratic on the surface . 
  in the uk we just have the first kind . 
  [ `` tor networks if you 're using a tor network , be aware that only tor relay nodes are supported to access bbc iplayer . 
  '' ] ( http://iplayerhelp.external.bbc.co.uk/tv/in_the_uk_message ) i do n't know what that actually means though . 
  in the past ( and similar is actually happening now due to low interest rates ) it 's caused by easy credit . 
  this pushes up demand which pushes up price . 
  the reason it eventually crashes is easy credit is linked to overleveraging . 
  so for instance at the moment interest rates are really low , but if they were to rise a lot of people may no longer be able to afford their mortgage , which means they default , which if it happens to many other people can lead to collapse . 
  nimbys plus [ green belt philosophy . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_belt_\\ ( united_kingdom \\ ) ), 
  yea we have similar problem in the uk , just not enough supply so it 's never ending :-\\, 
  yea ok that makes sense , you 're right . 
  it 's only if the asset value decreased that they 'd be in negative wealth . 
  every time someone takes out a new mortgage it is lowering net wealth . 
  if person a owns a house & has net worth of $ 200k , and person b is renting with a net worth of $ 0k , they then buy person a 's house for $ 200k , the net wealth in that system is now $ 0k while before it was $ 200k . 
  yes but every day there are new people buying more expensive houses so getting into more debt due to higher housing costs . 
  you would only see a large increase in net wealth if the housing value suddenly increased ( so there are n't enough new people buying new houses to compensate ) , and i 'm not sure 15 years is a short enough period for that , but you could be right .
