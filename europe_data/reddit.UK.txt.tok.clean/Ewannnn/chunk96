  my sentiments as well , although the changes they 're looking to [ implement with isds look good . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-5651_en.htm ) i think if this goes through it will quell a lot of peoples fears . 
  they can avoid pissing off russia for no reason . 
  i 'm not sure sweden has enemies , that 's not really their philosophy . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buy_american_act ) . 
  basically the us government should try to favour us firms when buying goods . 
  so therein lies the problem . 
  to be honest though i quite like this compromise politics when parties work together . 
  when you have opposition parties everything just swings backwards & forwards too much , better to keep things stable . 
  sounds like a win from their perspective . 
  the problem as i understand it is the swedish democrats are seen as kinda far right extreme party , so if the mainstream centre right parties agree to deal with them it may cost them votes in the election to the left . 
  it 's the same thing in the uk with ukip , even if they 're not that extreme they 're seen that way , so no party can support/work with them . 
  the deal was only to do with confidence & supply as far as i can see , the alliance opposition could still block other legislation . 
  basically it 's the only way either side could form a government without involving sd so it was inevitable really . 
  they can still be an effective opposition on most matters of legislation if they actually disagree , which on immigration they do n't seem to . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  because they compromised with the government ? 
  otherwise you would have just had another election . 
  it 's not undemocratic , as far as i read the opposition parties made the december agreement in exchange for concession from the sd & green government . 
  that was the negotiation . 
  the only party not getting any representation in the parliament are the democrats & they have a very small percentage of the votes so that 's not surprising . 
  i was referring to the eurofighter , which is n't technically an eu project but was built in combination of a number of eu states . 
  we already have shared military pooling on some equipment . 
  you do n't need to turn into a federation to build on that .

  how is the dutch accent silly ? 
  i 've never seen it that way tbh . 
  the french i understand though . 
  i think the italians should definitely be higher , their accents are ridiculous . 
  with agreement from the member states in accordance with eu rules yes . 
  when countries agree to join the eu they agree to join the eu as it is not how it will be . 
  once within the eu you campaign for the kind of eu you want to see . 
  as long as states are fine with the status quo they have n't joined too early , no state is obligated to accept closer and closer political union . 
  the uk has this voluntary databank too i think ( except they store all your medical records not just your dna ) . 
  big data can be useful for research purposes & to plan patient care . 
  the colours go well together though do n't you think ? 
  red , green & yellow look kinda awful together but it might just be me . 
  same , and for the same reasons . 
  similarly i very much like the netherlands flag . 
  the colours red , white & blue just go together very well . 
  i went to a coe school , it was n't like that at all . 
  the only religious stuff we did was hymns at assembly and we went to church a few times a year for special events ( remembrance day , easter ) . 
  i 'm not even christian btw , my parents are buddhist & i 'm agnostic/atheist . 
  you linked your own blog ? 
  lol . 
  because we like the status quo . 
  the ez can integrate further , and those states that want to do so can join it . 
  definitely no wish at all for a federation in britain . 
  but i can see the need for further integration within the ez . 
  my guess is that there will eventually be new ez institutions & a new ez parliament with executive authority . 
  the eu outside the ez will stay similar to how it is now . 
  the eu budget will probably just go down i 'd expect . 
  well it is our choice to work against integration , just as it is others to work towards it ? 
  not everyone agrees all the time that 's one of the basic traits to partnership . 
  we should leave because we do n't want to become a federation ? 
  that 's not what we signed up for , and that 's not what we 'll support the eu becoming . 
  we 've every right to prevent the eu becoming something we do n't want it to become , if we were inside the ez i would say the same about that too . 
  i ca n't read the article ( paywall ) but i would guess what hollande is saying is that britain should either quit the eu or let the ez integrate further . 
  if so this is a fair request , although it would be bad for britain if europe federalised & we were left outside , if that 's what they want it 's hard to justify continued veto of the idea . 
  if it 's actually about integrated *** eu *** well , it 's our prerogative that we work against integration if that 's what we want , as we are a part of the eu after all . 
  they 're relatively new members but they made the choice to not try & join the ez . 
  many other states that joined at the same time joined the erm & are now all inside the ez .

  well you 're not wrong , the propaganda machine has been going full tilt on this deal . 
  makes you wonder how much worse it would be if everything was actually discussed in the open , not to mention how much worse the resultant deal would be . 
  but yea , explaining your position on this repeatedly gets kinda tiring . 
  these common measures wo n't be put on the eu as a whole , there will be separate ez institutions . 
  the uk is n't the only country in the eu & not in the ez , there are 9 states , with 170 million in population & $ 6 trillion in gdp that are not in the ez but inside the eu . 
  is n't that just due to the rotterdam effect ? 
  making german intra ez imports larger than they actually are . 
  [ every day looks like this . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kcmhmr1.jpg ) how do you like [ them clouds ? 
  can you give some examples of how we would benefit from being more american ? 
  any more left wing americans can point me to things you think are done well in your country ?

  should be noted that france & germany saw far bigger per capita growth after the crash than america though , and massively more than the uk ( seriously growth in germany was 5-6 times more than the uk shortly after the crash , our recovery was absolutely awful ) . 
  edit : found the figures , in the first three years after the crisis german per capita gdp grew by 8 % while the uk grew by 1.9 % . 
  absolutely pathetic really . 
  come back in a few months & see if it 's changed . 
  the immigrant threads seem to have died down today for instance . 
  my representatives are n't voting for anything at the moment . 
  also the legislative system in europe & the uk is incredibly open . 
  i mean in the uk we have an entire channel devoted to it called bbc parliament . 
  i do n't think the ttip negotiations need to be transparent . 
  the commission is given a mandate by the elected governments & it 's up to them to negotiate the best deal for europe & the constituent member states . 
  well sure , i actually hate my government as well , but still i have faith we 'll get a good deal as i support free trade in principle ( and i 'd like to see more deals like this with other countries ) . 
  there are definitely a few dodgy things in the deal i 've heard about but overall it should be good for europe i think . 
  realistically this will have support of all national governments before it 's taken to a vote . 
  they have a veto on it , so proposing a deal they would n't agree to would be silly . 
  really the question is whether you trust your government at the end of the day . 
  if the deal is awful it 's probably unlikely to get to the voting stage in that state . 
  interesting read , thanks for sharing !, 
  one wonders if these changes will be included in the ceta deal as well . 
  the ep does n't propose legislation in the eu , the commission does . 
  nonsense , you do realise this deal will be debated in every single parliament in the eu ? 
  the last deal scrutinised that much was the lisbon treaty !,
