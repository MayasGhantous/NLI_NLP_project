  the ep are n't suppose to have a say on what 's inside ttip . 
  the purpose of the ep in regards to ttip is in scrutinising it after the deal is finished & signing off on it ( or not ) . 
  the commission are the ones negotiating the treaty & they do report to the council regularly . 
  the commission has directives from the member states on what they want from the deal & of course it will need unanimous approval in the council to pass anyway . 
  so your problem is with representative democracy ? 
  what 's the alternative , direct democracy where even less people read & understand the documents ? 
  all you have to do is read an / r/worldnews thread to realise the issue with that philosophy . 
  [ better outcomes for both sides .

  i find it amusing that people actually believe they would n't . 
  people also seem to think tpp & ttip would pass without the public even seeing the document . 
  there 's so much misinformation surrounding this deal ... 
  that 's cool , and when the deal is finished everyone can read it & make up their mind . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  he 's an idiot , but he looks practically sane compared to many of the other republican candidates . 
  i 'd be scared if i was american , as much as i hate many of our politicians we do n't have it nearly as bad in the uk as you do .

  you 're mistaking yourselves for germany . 
  are you sure it 's working properly for you ? 
  do you actually have people with positive scores ? 
  for instance , if you upvote someone they wo n't get +1 , if you downvote them they wo n't get -1 , however if you upvote then cancel the upvote they will get -1 even though you have n't upvoted/downvoted them at all . 
  [ see here ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/ed3af3d3e2cdc8ce684dbd9766fbc6ce.gif ) for an example . 
  upvote , refresh , remove upvote , score becomes negative .

  damn i have no idea then , ah well , guess i 'll keep searching . 
  cheers . 
  i think more the problem is the backlash rather than the leverage . 
  i mean bear in mind if there is debt forgiveness it does n't mean the money does n't have to be paid , it just means that ez taxpayers have to pay it instead . 
  it 's not surprising that this is difficult to justify , would you be happy with your government deciding to just give another country billions of euros of your tax money ? 
  of course it 's not that simple , but framing it in any other way is difficult i think . 
  what version of res do you have ? 
  i think perhaps it 's bugged in 4.5.4 ( a google result suggested the version released 7 months ago was bugged at least ) . 
  go to extensions to see the version # . 
  how do you turn it on ? 
  no shit , america are n't the ones being asked to provide debt relief . 
  they probably see the situation similar to the imf in that the debt is n't sustainable , but that does n't mean the idea of debt forgiveness is politically feasible , or that their opinion would be the same if they had to justify to their electorate such huge debt forgiveness . 
  how do you see this ? 
  is it a res feature ? 
  indeed , that 's why i 'd like to see almost full fiscal autonomy . 
  they can do anything they want but they have to keep the deficit in line with the uk average . 
  then the snp would have no one to blame but themselves for the black hole in the scottish budget . 
  it 's a monday morning in britain . 
  the sky is grey , the rain is falling , depression is creeping in . 
  such is life in britain . 
  so much for robot efficiency . 
  but seriously , does anyone know why this would be the case ? 
  but would you want the pm to do all the things the hos does on top of his current duties ? 
  as in do you want to stick with the parliamentary system but just ditch the hos ? 
  the us system is quite different & does n't have a parliament in the same sense . 
  most countries with parliamentary systems have a hos & a pm although one or two do n't . 
  the head of state is just a constitutional position i believe , and they deal with a lot of diplomacy that gives the pm more time to do serious stuff . 
  for instance our queen will often go on visits to commonwealth countries , which saves our pm from having to do it himself . 
  if the pm had to do both it would harm a country 's reputation imo because less could get done . 
  of course they could appoint a minister to do it but that 's not the same . 
  perhaps for a smaller country it makes sense though . 
  i often think the us system is a little silly for such a large country but portugal 's population is only the size of london !, 
  the us two party system or what ? 
  i think the system is fine , just the voters have to punish parties that are n't willing to work together . 
  cdu not even giving a supply agreement for instance makes no sense , it 's almost as if they 'd prefer a right wing government instead of actually having to give support for anything . 
  personally i like the german `` grand coalition '' politics though ( i hear scandinavian politics is like this too ) . 
  in the uk the two main parties are so ideological so politics jumps back & forth continuously . 
  it 's so inefficient and wastes time & money . 
  the current government for instance has spent 5 years , and will spend 5 more years reforming education . 
  then labour ( opposition ) will probably get in and scrap the entire system thus wasting 10 years of government policy . 
  it would work so much better if the parties would just work together and come up with a system they can both live with thereby not putting the education & health service through a total reorganisation of policy every 10 years . 
  that sounds really really silly . 
  a party being able to form a government without parliamentary support makes no sense . 
  sounds like you 'll be heading for another election . 
  i do n't know if the portuguese parliament works the same as in the uk , but could for example the cdu give support to a ps/be coalition in certain key votes ( budget for instance ) while remaining in opposition ? 
  basically ps/be form a minority government . 
  could n't the ps/be/cdu just entirely block a paf government in parliament due to their majority ? 
  in the uk the government has to gain `` confidence of the house '' by passing their queen 's speech , if this bill is blocked then they ca n't form a government & the opposition can form one instead , if neither side can form a government ( pass a queen 's speech ) within 30 days then a new election is called . 
  hypothetically if you use a similar system the left coalition ( ps/be/cdu ) could just block the right coalition queen 's speech . 
  cdu could then support ps/be in a [ confidence & supply agreement . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confidence_and_supply ), 
  is n't that a really bad idea when the election uses a proportional voting system ? 
  why does cdu not want to join ps/be , are n't they all left wing parties ? 
  why are ppd/psd & cds-pp listed as separate parties in the 2011 election but in the 2015 election they 're listed together ? 
  are they listed together on the ballot ? 
  [ this page is so confusing ] ( http://www.legislativas2015.mai.gov.pt/resultados-globais.html#none ) , you have ppd/psd . cds-pp , ppd/psd , cds-pp , cds-pp . ppm . 
  like what ? 
  hit the nail on the head . 
  this reminds me of [ chris sharma climbing an arch in mallorca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoqylheoly4 ) called [ es pont\u00e0s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/es_pont%c3%a0s ) . 
  if it 's the same company i would trust it , otherwise i would n't . 
  i look at uk polls all the time for instance and they vary so much between polling companies . 
  hmm those two articles are telling different things although the result is the same in that they both call for fiscal transfers . 
  the first one suggests a new treasury that can issue euro bonds essentially & the second one calls for transfers from a country 's tax receipts . 
  the greece thing was a one off , and many countries were n't at all happy & still are n't happy with debt forgiveness & forcing their citizens to lose money . 
  this goes even further than that , they will directly lose cash & the amount they lose ( if they go with the latter idea rather than euro bonds ) will be explicit . 
  if they use ez bonds the loss will be less explicit & wo n't immediately impact budgets so may be more accepted . 
  it could be spun , correctly , in a bad light though , as it 's essentially the same as states borrowing cash themselves & sending it to the eu . 
  only difference is the rate on these bonds will be lower than what individual states could get . 
  heh you 're right cheers . 
  sure but that 's not an argument for us sending more money to eastern europe via structural funds & cap benefits . 
  if the eu is n't a positive thing for poland without cap & eu structural funds i do n't think they should really be in the eu . 
  that 's a decision countries need to make . 
  not that i have a problem with eu immigrants but i do n't really buy that they benefit us hugely either . 
  perhaps if you 're a business owner that relies on low cost labour , but if you 're a low cost worker yourself ?
