  that 's the gist of it . 
  well that 's a typical conservative party for you . 
  it 's to be expected they will do these things . 
  indeed , this ca n't be surprising to anyone . 
  yea i agree with the first paragraph . 
  possibly true , it may just be my pacifism talking ( i 'd rather we acted more like germany , not getting involved in conflicts that do n't directly concern us ) . 
  this could essentially be summed up as the difference between friends & family . 
  i ca n't really see any scenario where we would n't be allies with the anglosphere . 
  europe is n't a country , if it was i 'd probably say europe . 
  as it stands america is much larger & has more influence so is obviously more important . 
  politically i 'm *** much more *** aligned with western europe though . 
  i 'd put france & germany joint second . 
  then catalonia should forever stay a part of the spanish state in my opinion . 
  but i do n't agree with assessment that it will never happen , the uk government was heavily against a referendum in the uk too till the nationalists got a larger percentage of the vote . 
  no i 'm saying i only support secession in the situation that the government of that country agrees . 
  i do n't support unilateral secession . 
  the referendum should only be taken in catalonia . 
  perhaps , the catalans will just have to keep pushing for independence . 
  they need to convince the spanish people the most , that may change the government 's mind . 
  does n't the example in the uk kinda contradict this logic ? 
  i 'm not saying spain needs to have a referendum on it , but they need to have a government that supports secession . 
  i would n't have a problem with being a part of france to be honest !, 
  i just think the people of the entire country should decide . 
  i mean i do n't have a problem with wales or scotland or ni going independent for instance , i support a referendum , but i think it should be for the entire uk to decide . 
  we obviously never had a referendum on the issue in the uk but we 've elected successive governments that have supported giving scotland a referendum so people are obviously content with it . 
  edit : obviously this opinion only counts for democracies , if it 's a dictatorship the situation is different . 
  yes & i do n't agree with unconditional self-determination . 
  it makes perfect sense , catalonia is a part of spain therefore spain should make the choice about whether they 're allowed to leave . 
  people from catalonia may consider themselves catalonian but they are still spanish in the eyes of the spanish state . 
  even if constitutional changes were n't required i still think it 's up to spain to decide . 
  states should n't get to just unilaterally secede as i said , the whole country has to agree to it . 
  then have a referendum , then live with the consequences . 
  indeed . 
  it is not up to catalonia to unilaterally decide to secede it is for the whole nation of spain to decide . 
  slavery was banned throughout the entire british empire not just in britain itself . 
  many years ago a subway near me was doing buy one sub get 2 free . 
  the queues were ridiculous . 
  i thought to myself why are you queuing for 1hr to save a few quid ? 
  if it was n't for the sale you probably would n't get subway anyway . 
  it 's then that i realised the lengths people will go for a bargain . 
  this investment plan by junker is a great idea . 
  i wish the uk would do something similar by investing in a uk development bank ( kinda like the nib ) . 
  our current investment in infrastructure is much too small . 
  it 's disappointing , now is the cheapest time to borrow yet everyone is trying to save , it does n't make good business sense at all . 
  principle of non-refoulment means you can not deport refugees ( or asylum seekers ) . 
  which makes sense , just put them in jail . 
  refugees are n't a nationality . 
  a few refugees commit crimes , therefore all refugees are evil ? 
  germany will be fine , your labour market is pretty flexible . 
  for instance in germany unemployment among foreigners is just 9.2 % compared with 4.5 % for nationals . 
  in sweden unemployment among foreigners is 19.6 % and among nationals 6.1 % . 
  [ give this a read , it 's in relation to the uk . 
  ] ( http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/ea019.pdf ) there is also [ this more recent in-depth report . 
  ] ( http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit05.pdf ) `` to see if employment and wage prospects for less skilled uk nationals are associated with eu immigration , figure 10 looks at the change in the neet rate ( ` not in education , employment or training ' ) for low skilled uk-born , defined as those who left school at the minimum leaving age or younger . 
  ** there is again no effect of eu immigration on their job prospects . 
  if anything , the relationship is negative -- neet rates fell furthest between 2008 and 2015 in areas where eu immigration rose faster . 
  but the estimate , like all others , is statistically insignificant . 
  ** '' `` likewise , figure 11 shows ** no obvious link between the pay of less skilled uk-born individuals and changes in the local area population of eu nationals over this period . 
  ** '' `` one group that does seem to lose out from new immigration is the stock of other recent arrivals ( manacorda et al , 2011 ) . 
  so although there is no negative effect on uk-born workers , there might be some depressing effects on other immigrants who settled in the uk a few years back . '', 
  the uk labour market obviously is different to sweden , although more similar to the us . 
  sweden definitely has an issue with bringing immigrants into the labour market , but america and the uk do not . 
  it 's possible there is some localised swing yea , but on the national level there does n't seem to be , which is what would matter in a federal election . 
  die linke are up 1 % on their result at the last federal elections , they also have n't really lost any vote share in the last few months ( to be honest their vote has n't really change since 2013 ) . 
  afd have been making gains but its been at the expense of the cdu . 
  greens are up massively from last election too , around 5 % . 
  the swings are basically sd -  green cdu -  afd and to a lesser extent fdp [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_german_federal_election ), 
  this is likely to be the case yeah , which means grand coalition for the foreseeable future . 
  i do n't know the figure for all government spending but official estimates in the uk for benefit fraud are 0.7 % . 
  funnily enough the public think that [ 24 % of benefits are claimed fraudulently ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3188/perceptions-are-not-reality-the-top-10-we-get-wrong.aspx ) !, 
  ironically it 's the left that wins in this regard since no one will work with the far right . 
  they can just apply for a visa currently though ? 
  are you really saying that getting a visa is so hard that it is stopping turkish people from coming to europe if they really want to ? 
  this goes both ways . 
  this will decrease as long as sweden allows family reunification i guess ? 
  do they allow family reunification ? 
  i do n't know . 
  unless for some reason there is an imbalance of girls in the countries they 're coming from , this should solve the problem . 
  the first option is n't feasible in a western country like the uk , or do you have precedent i 'm not aware of ? 
  japan is a decent counterexample here . 
  the second point does n't necessitate austerity or suggest the uk did n't have other borrowing options . 
  it 's especially the case in germany . 
  for instance between 2009 and 2015 uk pop increased by around 5 million while german pop decreased by 1 million . 
  per capita their growth post crisis ( 2009 to 2012 ) was around twice absolute growth . 
  cheers , that is indeed a large difference . 
  i 'll post you one when i 'm home . 
  the u.k. benefits massively from population growth too , for the 3 years post crisis for instance growth was higher in the uk but per capita growth was actually higher in france ( 2009-2012 ) . 
  not sure how that is now , i should imagine we 've overtaken france post crisis but the difference wo n't be that large . 
  the french work more on avg than the brits iirc ? 
  or similar at least . 
  how do you suppose a country like the uk ` runs out of money ' ? 
  spending under thatcher was higher than under labour post 1997 . 
  - too big to fail banks , check - suing for lost profits , check - all regulations are good , check - neoliberal privatisation agenda , check this is just a walking cliche is n't it ? 
  surely there are legitimate concerns in this deal but instead they 've gone for this bullshit . 
  what is it with this dae think everyone should spend 2 % of gdp on defence circle jerk on reddit ? 
  i think apart from e europe most people do not fear war any more , and rightfully so ( a war within the eu from a country outside the eu is a ridiculous idea ) . 
  thus they do n't see why so much money should be spent on equipment that is never used and just wasted . 
  it makes some sense for countries like the uk that have a strong military manufacturing base and we actually use our troops abroad ( which i agree with for humanitarian reasons ) but not for countries like germany or the netherlands . 
  not unless their population changes and becomes more interventionist .
