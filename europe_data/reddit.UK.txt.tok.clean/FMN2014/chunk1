   the liberal alde group in the european parliament called yesterday ( 21 september ) for the activation of article 7 of the eu treaty against hungary over its handling of refugees . 
  the punishment , sometimes referred to as `` the nuclear bomb '' , has never been used before . 
   [ ... ]  under article 7 of the lisbon treaty , serious breaches to the values of human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights by a member state can result in a suspension or loss of voting rights in the eu council of ministers . 
   if article 7 is activated , this would mean hungary would temporarily lose its eu membership rights . 
  but before such a decision can be taken , the council shall hear the member state in question and may address recommendations . 
  seems like a fair and balanced proposal .

   after a spate of thefts , which included the theft of all four signs in one night , and a total of fifteen over a period of several years , in august 2005 the road signs were replaced with theft-resistant ones , welded to steel and secured in concrete to prevent them being stolen . 
  mayor h\u00f6ppl said that officials were fed up with english-speaking tourists stealing the signs , and noted that with the newly installed signs it would take all night to steal one . 
  h\u00f6ppl said that tourists , and the money they bring to the area , were welcome , but locals were sick of replacing the fucking signs . 
  commander schmitzberger , the local police chief , also hinted at other avenues to stop what he calls `` foreign criminals '' from disturbing order in the village . 
  regarding these `` other avenues '' , schmitzberger stated , `` what they are , i am not at liberty to disclose , but we will not stand for the fucking signs being removed .

  most successful as in largest labour majority and most elections won by a labour leader . 
  no one should listen to the most successful labour leader , when talking about the leadership election ? 
  they are the two main factions of the liberal democrats . 
  the beveridge group is centre-left faction and the orange bookers is the more centre right faction . 
  that would be good way to destroy his leadership and lose support to ukip . 
  it like jar jar binks ' older brother . 
  not surprising . 
  thy had a short leadership election and then the media became focused on corbyn and the labour leadership election . 
  with tim farron being a beveridge grouper rather than a orange booker i think they are in a great position to win the centrist labour voters . 
  assuming they get there arse in gear . 
  people want to be successful , people want their children to be successful , the idea of capping how much someone can be successful ( which a wage cap is ) would n't play well with most people . 
  i 'm more of a small-c conservative or one nation tory with liberal democratic leanings i.e civil liberties . 
  2 years atleast . 
  if it 's opposition you want , corbyn certainly the labour leader for it . 
   wants to introduce a maximum wage . 
  how will that play in the press ? 
  #cooky corbyn and loony labour want to cap how much you can be payed . 
  as a liberal democrat/tory aligned person i 'm happy . 
  ~ ~ e : n'aw are the corbynistas annoyed . 
  tony blair was left of centre , he just accepted if labour had to win they needed to accept that the public had accepted individualism .

  small c conservative is when you are a conservative but do n't align with any of the conservative parties in you country , i do n't align with the tories or ukip .
