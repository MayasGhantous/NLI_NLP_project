   it annoys me that jura the island to the west of scotland is n't colored to show it belongs to the uk . 
  there is also the isle of anglesey and the orkney island . 
   but what really annoys me is that the geology of jura has is not from the jurassic . 
  not just a little bit , it is mostly precambrian if we are to believe the official geological map of scotland . 
  that is at least 300 million years off . 
  which idiot named that island . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jura,_scotland )  the modern name `` jura '' dates from the norse-gael era and is from the old norse dyr\u00f8y meaning `` beast [ wild animal ] island '' .

  i got a lot of sex education in school starting in p6 ( 10 ) with learning about puberty and how this will change us . 
  then we got more in third year ( 15 ) were we learnt about porn , masterbating , relationships and how to put a condom on ( for this the teacher brought out a dildo and we hat to put the condom on it ) .

   rumours spread through international news media in april 2012 that villagers had been thinking about changing the name of the village or had actually voted to change it . 
  the satirical website the spoof !, 
  published a story on 18 april 2012 saying that the villagers were fed up and wanted to change the name . 
  this minor satire was expanded upon and appeared on the same day in the daily mirror newspaper and elsewhere during the following week as a genuine news item , and was repeated by the guardian and the huffington post , who reported that a vote had taken place to change the name to fugging , but it was discovered that a village with that name already existed in the municipality of obritzberg-rust just west of herzogenburg . 
  the mayor of fucking denied these false stories when contacted .

  favourite quote about fucking . 
   after a spate of thefts , which included the theft of all four signs in one night , and a total of fifteen over a period of several years , in august 2005 the road signs were replaced with theft-resistant ones , welded to steel and secured in concrete to prevent them being stolen . 
  mayor h\u00f6ppl said that officials were fed up with english-speaking tourists stealing the signs , and noted that with the newly installed signs it would take all night to steal one . 
  h\u00f6ppl said that tourists , and the money they bring to the area , were welcome , but locals were sick of replacing the fucking signs . 
  ** commander schmitzberger , the local police chief , also hinted at other avenues to stop what he calls `` foreign criminals '' from disturbing order in the village . 
  regarding these `` other avenues '' , schmitzberger stated , `` what they are , i am not at liberty to disclose , but we will not stand for the fucking signs being removed . 
  it may be very amusing for you british , but fucking is simply fucking to us . 
  what is this big fucking joke ? 
  it is puerile .
