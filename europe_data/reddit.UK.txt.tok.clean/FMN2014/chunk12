  phoenix wright ace attorney would be an interesting game in russia . 
  do n't make fun of the ministry , they gave me a grant to develop my silly walk . 
  i too am a unionist , and i respectfully disagree . 
  the argument for the independence was weak i.e the pound , not paying the scottish share of the debt , instant entry into europe and the cost of separating on small business . 
  also between the scottish devolution referendum in 1979 and the independence referendum in 2014 there were 36 years , so there probably wo n't be another referendum in a decade . 
  the snp ca n't demand a referendum . 
  a united ireland under poland . 
  [ subtle . 
  i recall him . 
  i hope they continue to clean up their society . 
  what has spurned the anti-corruption action in romania ? 
  sad , but not surprising . 
  most sociopaths will go for power and influence and they 're good at making decisions , regardless of whether it is moral . 
  sun 's out , guns out . 
  the more money i get the closer i 'll be to being heinrich . 
  i know the hansa can be really good with trade ideas . 
  is that a challenge ? 
  [ of course it is !, 
  it 's built by the uk .

  so sad this happened in 90s europe , so much lost - lives , homes , history and culture . 
   when they re-elected syriza when a new election was called ? 
  35 % of people voted for syriza . 
   oh right ... ` some ' ... so like ... 5 people ? 
  in the last election eurosceptics garnered around a quarter of the vote . 
  they did ? 
  when ? 
  also , do note the word ` some ' in my comment . 
   almost nobody in the eurozone sees the euro as a failure . 
  i wonder how some greeks feel about this comment . 
  [ betteridge 's law of headlines . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines ), 
   does this answer to your question ? 
  yes , thanks . 
  what are the main differences between iu and podemos ? 
  yeah , ta for reminding me . 
  i 'd go with the latin names : for the uk ; the united kingdom of britannia and northern hibernia for britain ; britannia for scotland ; caledonia for wales ; cambria for northern ireland ; northern hibernia for england ; anglia, 
  [ the uk would have to call itself hearts then . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edinburgh_derby ), 
  majority of it the past was too liberal in wording , but the paramilitaries are either gone or nothing more the criminal gangs , the ruc was abolished and a fairer psni was established , and sinn fein and the dup share power - hell , ian paisley and martin mcguinness shared the office of fm . 
  if that is n't large progress i do n't know what is . 
  and on borders , the cta has existed since before the uk and roi joined the eu and before the eu itself . 
  it would continue regardless of either state 's relationship with the eu . 
  the eu does provide fund the wm perhaps would n't for ni yes . 
  but you completely fail to mention the unionist and nationalist putting the majority of the past behind them , and the work of the major and blair premierships , and the irish government 's in the role of the ni peace process . 
  no , but the place is making progress from where it was 20 years ago . 
  quite the chip on your shoulder . 
  i would n't be surprised if my countrymen could n't pin point the czech republic on a map . 
  so in the czech one we were second and in the polish one we are fourth . 
  it seems the slavs are fond of us . 
  yelling ` hear , hear ' . 
  i really did n't like it , however i went to a town outside of naples ( sorrento ? ), 
  which i really loved . 
  i did find the main thoroughfare to be quite dusty and some roads had very bad potholes , beyond that it was a beautiful city . 
  naples is a complete dump , it was a pleasure to get out of that city . 
  the exact thing on capital punishment that happened in france that / u/low _ discrepancy said happened in the uk , and until recently the public was pro-bringing it back . 
  did you miss the euroisation of britain ? 
   also economy improved under his rule so a lot of people started to believe he was a saviour after such a long political unrest and instability since 1960s . 
  ah , ` it 's the economy , stupid . ', 
  so do you think a party chp or otherwise could ever beat akp in an election ? 
  well that 's sad , i would like to see the turkish people progress towards more secular and liberal values . 
   chp voters are desperate and are worried about the future of turkey . 
  they think the country is on it 's way to becoming another me shithole and despise erdogan and all his policies . 
  what could chp do to win ? 
  but they got a majority of the seats , because the seat threshold is 10 % and the parties that do n't get to that amount have their votes go to the other parties that do win iirc . 
  [ the camorra are also in my city ( in scotland ) .

  perfect . 
  [ aye , but some speak scots in ulster and that 's not on the map . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulster_scots_dialects ), 
  where is the scots in ulster and the norman languages in the channel islands * ? 
  the anglo-irish were part of the uk at the time , so no foreign origin . 
   anglo irish is not british but that has n't stopped them being misappropriated . 
  did n't say it was , i said it could be ` claimed by both britain and ireland ' , which it can most the time . 
   then again britain taking stuff that 's not there 's is n't new . 
  depends , do they have a flag ? 
   swift anglo-irish , so can be claimed by both britain and ireland  stoker british and irish  joyce he was solely irish e : also conrad was polish and british, 
  they have to get their house in order , there was great enthusiasm after the maidan that they were on the way to stamping out corruption ( among other things ) but in reality they just swapped pro-russian oligarchs for pro-eu/west oligarchs . 
  it was n't wiped out by the british government , it was ` gradually replaced by scots ' from the 15th century on ( before there was a british government ) . 
  i think this is cool , i would like to see something similar in orkney and shetland - they used to speak ( until 1850 ) [ a scandinavian language called ` norn . 
  [ are you from limburg per chance . 
  ] ( http://www.pornhub.com/insights/netherlands-top-searches ) i cocked up the title , it 's relative searches . 
  huh , til . 
  thanks ,, 
  so any dutch want to explain limburg ? 
  were you a jimmy savile fan ? 
  although i 'm happy sarkozy is drumming to to a eurosceptic beat , i ca n't help but think this electioneering to thwart fn taking his would be voters and that it may all be hot air . 
   the biggest royal domain of the world is in france ( versailles ) . 
  hold on m8 , you got rid of your monarchy - you do n't get to claim that . 
  that german sense of humour . 
  a common theme with scottish councils , aberdeen 's is hated by the city . 
   in the uk i do n't rate cleanliness as one of our best although i found edinburgh to be good when i went and brighton always feels clean ( might be the sea ) . 
  the thing that i found unclean in edinburgh was the lack of bins for homes and business , they just piled the bin bags on one another . 
  if every scottish seat returned a labour mp there would still be a tory majority . 
  [ 210,000 according to wikipedia . 
   when britain leaves the eu the eu will collapse . 
  you 'll lose # 53 million per day , soon as the eu tries to impose tariffs on trade goods the eu economy will collapse because we import more from europe than we export to them . 
  the eu needs us , we do n't need them , we 'll trade with the rest of the world . 
  f *** the europeans , we are british ! .
