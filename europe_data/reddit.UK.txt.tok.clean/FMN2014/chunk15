  probably not confusion and probably not even the final number , the hostages tend to get killed in these situation and people will die later because of wounds . 
  but a large amount of them do have problems with ghettoisation and people leaving to join isis . 
  not to mention the hostages , if reports are to be believed there are 60 of them .

   how do you think of your self ? 
   british 44 % | irish 28 % | northern irish 22 % | other 5 % i do n't like these answers given to the people polled . 
  it 's possible to be both british and irish in identity , hell ian paisley said he was irish . 
  although maybe that why ` northern irish is provided . 
  is that not because of the ` double-irish ?

  osborne knew it would be politically difficult for clegg to reneged on his promise and gave him an out . 
  osborne gave clegg an out on raising them , he did n't take the out .

   a common border and border guard to police our frontiers effectively  a pooling of military resources into a unified force to reduce efficiency , to make ourselves less dependent on the us and gives us options when making foreign policy decisions as well as presenting a strong deterrent against aggressors  common foreign policy , where we make key decisions as a whole instead of 28 voices saying contradictory things , so we have stronger bargaining positions on the international stage  common economic policies so that we can have more accountability to prevent major crises from popping up these wants you list , especially the military and foreign policy can only be done through cessation of all national sovereignty .

  i have no negative experiences with central/eastern europeans ; poles , lithuanians , latvians , estonians and russians all went to my school and they bantered with native brits . 
  my comment was a joke btw . 
  but yeah , in parts of many english cities there is a problem with self-segregation and ghettoisation . 
  also i agree the eastern europeans do integrate better , as they are european in culture . 
  yeah . 
  luckily there is a chance parliament asserts its sovereignty , issues like this ca n't be decided by the lowest common denominator . 
  of course , the french have been vocal in picking over the city . 
  they 'll want to gives limited free movement in return for the city not being able to passport . 
  he 's probably courting the eurosceptic vote in france , sarkozy is doing the same . 
  at least it shows they 've integrated . 
  no problem , your english is 100 time better than my french . 
  i think ' brits finally masters of their own house ' is a better translation for what it 's trying to convey .

  i 'm not particularly pro-eu , if anything i 'm somewhat eurosceptic . 
  however i support remain for the reasons ; * most of our trade is conducted with the eu , why leave the market and not be able to shape the rules . 
  * the eu market will one day deepen to a service 's union - something that will benefit the uk . 
  * eu funding has been promised to wind farms in my area . 
  * britain alone wo n't get as good trade deals as the eu with large countries . 
  * i quite fancy the idea of living and working in the eu without hassle .

  definitely older generations , my great uncle is not too fond of the irish , nor was my grandda . 
   i want to see genetic comparisons with north africans . 
  roman , greek , italian , french , spanish and british colonisation would lead to similar genes i imagine . 
  i had a kuwaiti friend who said if you 're white you can get a drink easy in kuwait . 
  i imagine qatar is similar .
