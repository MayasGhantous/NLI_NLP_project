  * i am catalan , catalan is a romance language , like spanish , portuguese , french or italian . 
  * * if it was for the reason that you say , portugal and spain also they should be together , do n't they ? 
  or france or italy . 
  in fact the spanish and the portuguese have more similarities than catalan and spanish . 
  * * in addition , the differences are not only linguistic , if not historical , and cultural . 
  in addition , it is a language more than living and public use in the television , film , newspapers , literature .

  reminds meet of that episode of jeremy clarkson ` meet the neighbours ' when jeremy says he can go on a spanish toll bridge for free because the uk puts more into the eu budget than it takes out . 
   agree , but it 's not what you understand when some talks about `` criminal immigrants '' . 
  the term `` illegal immigrant '' is used for this . 
  illegally entering a country is a crime , so by extension they are criminals . 
   there should be a agency equally funded by all members that would help with border controls , so no country has to spend their own money . 
  i do n't think anyone would oppose since it 's obvious most immigrants come through towards the richer countries in the north ... that would be great but as i previously said it does n't currently exist . 
   not all migrants are criminals the vast majority coming via the mediterranean are by the nature of illegally coming to europe . 
   many countries are facing the same challenge . 
  the answer is not debt reduction , there should be other mechanisms in place for greece , hungary , italy , spain , etc. 
  i agree but there is n't and greece going the grueling public sector cuts will lead to their ability to stop migrants going to other eu countries difficult . 
   i hope you understand the difference between a nuclear-armed soviet union and some immigrants on boats . 
  yes i understand that . 
  with the vast hordes of criminal migrants descending upon greece i would say a strong greece is in the european interest . 
  * sir , i salute your courage , your strength , your indefatigability , and i can honestly tell that there was not a single person to whom i told i was coming to iraq and hoping to meet with yourself , who did not wish me to convey their heartfelt fraternal greetings and support .

   likewise students at brown university , who were exposed to two sides of a debate on the same topic , were offered a `` safe space '' equipped , according to an account in the new york times , with `` cookies , coloring books , bubbles , play-doh , calming music , pillows , blankets and a video of frolicking puppies , as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma . '' this is what my nursery was like when i was 4 . 
   ex-president actually . 
  today 's president is donald tusk , but whatever . 
  i said ` then president ' . 
   that 's his oppinion which if i remember corrently , was stated when he was sitting next to the spanish foreign affairs minister ( with a grin on his face ) . 
  hardly something to be taken into account . 
  the eu is neutral on this issue . 
  it 's not his opinion , he is stating a fact that a new country would not be subject to any eu treaties . 
   there is no law , official statement or treaty that applies in this case , so this is just pure speculation there is a [ statement ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/140072.pdf ) from then president of the european council herman van rompuy :  second , i just want to recall some of the principles that would apply in such a scenario . 
  the separation of one part of a member state or the creation of a new state would not be neutral as regards the eu treaties . 
  the european union has been established by the relevant treaties among the member states . 
  the treaties apply to the member states . 
  if a part of the territory of a member state ceases to be a part of that state because that territory becomes a new independent state , the treaties will no longer apply to that territory . 
  in other words , a new independent state would , by the fact of its independence , become a third country with respect to the union and the treaties would , from the day of its independence , not apply anymore on its territory . 
  under article 49 of the treaty on european union , any european state which respects the principles set out in article 2 of the treaty on european union may apply to become a member of the union according to the known accession procedures . 
  in any case , this would be subject to ratification by all member states and the applicant state . 
  official statement, 
  oh yes i can or maybe i ca n't . 
  * i think you 'll find that 's legal tender . 
  i neither agree or disagree . 
   no i did n't start a new account just to ask you . 
  i delete and start new account every few months . 
  why ? 
  you might think that , i could n't possibly comment . 
  scouse , geordie , glaswegian and aberdonian ( although i as a native ca n't hear why ) .
