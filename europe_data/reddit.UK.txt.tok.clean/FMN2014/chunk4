  northern ireland will probably be higher than england & wales or scotland . 
  he nearly died in a plane crash . 
  totally hilarious lol . 
  i can see him singing ' i want to break free ' . 
  it was actually lazy labour , not shy tory ,, 
  it is a one party state . 
   i think you got it backways . 
  the opinion of countries that are not participants to the integration is irrelevant , i.e. 
  the uk . 
  and france ? 
  i do n't think the uk is owed much money from greece . 
  i was just saying that the eu did fuck over our fishing industry . 
  fucked over our fishing . 
  a relative of mine served in the arctic convoys that headed to archangel and murmansk during ww2 . 
  my great uncle said he got a stutter because of the constant torpedoing the convoy endured . 
  ha ha , i misread your first comment as 90 % of germans support voting no on the referendum . 
  so i was somewhat taken aback . 
   the german news channel n-tv had a poll about giving a third program to greece today , and it had 95 % calling in for a no . 
  i do n't know n-tv demographics and popularity are but if it is representative of the german population at large i stand corrected, 
  meh , in this world you are either an empire or part of someone else . 
  at least we are apart of one we influenced in creating . 
  yeah i gather that countries vary but i imagine the italians and portuguese would be against it because they stomached the austerity , bulgaria and romania would be against because the greeks get payed a higher wage , the former eastern bloc countries are more conservative so they would be too and the germans would most definitely be against it because they and merkel have been the subject of much derision . 
  that was the joke . 
  are n't the majority of the eu citizens against syriza getting away with its demands , so are n't ` europe 's elites ' just representing there constituents ? 
  nah we 're celibate , like a village priest who everyone think is gay but is just very camp . 
  truly a man we should all aspire to be like . 
  you can make a text post . 
  hopefully the uk remains whole and the nationalism dies down . 
  theresa may 's 2020 election slogan . 
  no need to be angry croot , everyone knows the capital of croatia is zadar . 
  conservative were pro-austerity , labour were pro-austerity , the liberal democrats were pro-austerity and ukip were pro-austerity . 
  it 's fair to say this constituted more than 50 % of the vote . 
  e : [ 87.7 % of the public voted for austerity . ],

  utterly moronic , the idea that parents know better than doctors is dangerous and the parents should be prosecuted .

   the uk and ireland voted for rights ( except for ** northern ireland ** ) . 
  do n't worry dutchmen we will save europe from tyranny , as is our duty . 
  you wo n't be laughing when friesland becomes a province of the french low country . 
   i 'm on ** holiday ** . 
  what are you ? 
  a colonial ?

  what he said was moronic and without being self-referential , you are a moron . 
  and since i ca n't be arsed replying to you defending someone who is ignorant and makes sweeping generalisation i will not reply to anymore of your comments , bye . 
  what you said before was n't this most articulate comment , so i tried to discern what you said . 
  for what reason ? 
  what the his original comments ' absurdity ? 
  yes . 
   i did n't mean just you . 
  so you 're calling everyone who is n't a supporter of a federal europe is stupid ? 
  what an elitist snob you are . 
   the constant switching between sweeping generalisations and nitpicking is rather tiring . 
  i 'm not nitpicking what he said was wrong . 
  so you agree that people that do n't support a federal europe are hyper nationalistic ? 
  and that without the eu we would n't have progress , unity or peace ? 
  me not agreeing with his assertion that anti-federalism supporters are ` hyper nationalistic ' is stupidity ? 
  he did n't say a few , he generalized about a large swathe of the european population . 
   that prevents the represenation of extremists . 
  democracy should only be for the reasonable . 
  that excludes you then . 
  two things , it does sound like a fascistic slogan and also you 've tackled none of my others points so i assume you concede defeat . 
   that 's probably because anti-eurofed people are blinded by hyper-nationalism saying that people who are anti-federalism are hypernationalism is a most ignorant statement . 
   and completely unable to understand the sacrifices necessary for progress , unity and peace . 
  why do you think without the european union peace would n't be preserved ? 
  do you think germans , french , italians etc are unable to remain at peace without some mep 's in brussels ? 
  also ` progress , unity and peace ' sounds orwellian . 
  *****  farage farage rule britannia i do n't support farage . 
   with one mp seat though : ( and 12.6 % of the vote . 
  what a moronic statement . 
  i thought it was more a borders or lothian accent . 
   metropolitan city mhp voters generally close to chp why do n't they vote chp then ? 
  it 's all foreign to me . 
   this time without the need to suppress a local population . 
  * sigh * ** puts away whip . 
  yeah that 's why i prefaced with ' * according to wikipedia * ' . 
   the right-left conflict what was this conflict ? 
  according to there [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalist_movement_party ) they believe in ` neo-fascism ' and are ` far-right ' .
