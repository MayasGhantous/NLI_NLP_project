  you had to be rich and christian to attend school hundreds of years ago , but then some rich people started school for people of any religion so long as they paid for it . 
  these became known as ` public schools ' . 
  cameron wants to make it look like he 's tough on europe . 
  he ca n't legally do it though , as if he did he would break the good friday agreement and the scotland act . 
  * scrapping the european human rights act and replacing it with a ` british bill of rights ' . 
  * passing the ` snoopers charter/data communications bill ' which is a bill for isp to store user information and search history for up to a year .

   thank you uk for british television !,

  [ my reaction to this post . 
  far right ; british national party , although they have all but died this past election , the english defense league and britain first ( they always pop up on facebook ) . 
  far left ; we have dozens of communist and socialist parties , ironically the far-left which is all about solidarity is fractured .

  well you can be salafi and as long as you do n't try and push your religion on others you are fine , but if you attempted to bring an ak-47 to anywhere in the united kingdom you can and will be prosecuted or if you believe that social programs are facist i fail to see why you would live in europe . 
  well canada , australia , usa and new zealand are all culturally british , so i 'm fine with more of our colonial cousins coming over .

  i was in edinburgh and the women there are not something to turn your nose up at . 
  cameron is n't anti-eu , he like most of the tory leadership are neutral or pro eu . 
  the problem for cameron now , unlike in coalition is that his small majority can fall to the hard right eurosceptic wing of his party . 
  it seems to me that just like major 's premiership that europe will be the fault line .

  you 're letting down the anglosphere . 
  yeah , i 'm going with chuka to lead labour , he 'll have the backing of the blairite and centrist labour mp 's and he is charismatic enough to lead a major party .

  there was no english identity in the [ 2001 census ] ( https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/environment-and-planning/planning/development-and-population-information/demography-and-housing/documents/city-of-london-census-2001-demographic-information.pdf ) , there was however white british . 
  it is the majority by a very large margin . 
  london was given the london assembly in 2000 , so were the white british , most of whom i imagine were english not english ? 
  london has a devolved parliament it is still english . 
  join a party , attend local meetings and volunteer for you local party 's candidate in local and state elections .

  nein problem . 
  you 're like everything hitler hated .

  it is illegal to die in the house of parliament , so if you feel a heart attack coming be a lawful and respectful citizen and die outside . 
  in hereford you can kill a welshman with a longbow and in chester you can kill a bow and arrow but only at night , obviously . 
  in york you can shoot a scotsman .
