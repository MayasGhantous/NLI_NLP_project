  you are right with these result we have a more pro-eu parliament with labour being the only party that could form an effective government .

  hurrah to phones !, 
  he was a british citizen when he invented it . 
   while having almost similar views as hitler . 
  at the time churchill was around it was the prevailing consensus among most of society that white people were ` on top ' . 
  but churchill did n't ally with hitler , far from it . 
  churchill believed in democracy , not democracy of the many mind you , but democracy of the few . 
   well , does n't really matter though , i see i am getting into an argument not argument , a spirited debate . 
   with someone who is proud of the `` empire '' . 
  of course i am proud of empire , britain a tiny country became over the course of a few centuries the unquestioned superpower ruling vast tracts of land all over the world . 
  some of which we ruled via local leaders ( india ) . 
  but as my original comment shows some of the things my country has done i am ashamed of i.e slavery and exploitation . 
  churchill is by know means perfect , he was an elitist and imperialist . 
  but during the war i understand how he would find it easy to rationalise the starving of 3 million bengalis ( some of whom would have died anyway ) , than the starving of british soldiers ( a large amount of which were from india ) . 
  am i proud of him ? 
  yes !, 
  he stood up to hitler when chamberlain failed , he bound the nation together and lead us through a time when britain stood alone , isolated from our empire because of the u-boats , when europe had fallen to the jackboot of nazism and when the usa and ussr were neutral . 
  proud * empire , seriously a country as small as us forged the largest empire in history . 
  * the english language and all the works with it . 
  * our contributions to the world ; the tv , telephone , penicillin , steam engine , the world wide web ( with the belgians ) and the microchip . 
  * we were the birthplace of the industrial revolution and the enlightenment . 
  * the westminster parliament ( ` the mother of all parliaments ' ) . 
  * abolition . 
  * defeating napoleon , the kaiser and hitler . 
  * churchill * attlee ashamed * our role in the slave trade . 
  * cromwellian reconquest of ireland . 
  * aboriginal australian genocide * indian exploitation . 
  * fire bombing of dresden . 
  i do n't recall ever hearing about someone being chastised about being patriotic . 
  the martians are culturally closer to the europeans than the turks . 
  i think it is a lost cause , i think an admission of guilt and an apology is what is warranted .
