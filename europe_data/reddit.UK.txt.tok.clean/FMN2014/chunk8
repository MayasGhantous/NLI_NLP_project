  it would be difficult and i 'm not entirely sure how they would be compelled to pay . 
  but the west germany-israel reparations treaty has set a precedent . 
  if they admit it was that severe they would have to pay reparations . 
  also this purely speculation , the armenia diaspora would have right of return . 
  mods new [ flair . 
  they will probably get eu membership before turkey . 
  our relationship with europe is one of the key issues in the election campaign . 
  before that the iraq war . 
  he can be condescending , but overall i like him . 
  a lot of people think richard dawkins is a bit of a twat . 
  a website full of shit and sensationalism . 
  hmmmm , [ this one . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html ), 
  if the cold war taught us anything it was that competition in science produces the best results . 
   there were more than the irish and the atlantic slave trade , much of which is swept under the rug . 
  indians were treated terribly . 
  so were africans who were n't part of the slave trade . 
  even after slavery we had indentured servitude , basically slavery . 
   we had the opium wars , what we did to the aboriginals in australia , canada etc. 
  there 's an endless list of our past crimes which have left huge populations devastated . 
  we have a lot of history , so sorry we do n't include everything in the education system . 
  but it is hardly like we deny it we did horrible things . 
  also we did n't commit crimes , as there was no laws against what we did  saying `` we stopped doing that in the 50s '' is treating it too lightly . 
  saying we largely stopped our imperial ambitious at this time is not treating it lightly . 
   even then we continue to fuck with the developing world , famously in the iran coup , and the suez crisis . 
  they were in the 50 's . 
  how do we not acknowledge that ? 
  i was taught about the clearances , persecution of the irish and the atlantic slave trade . 
  it is pretty common knowledge that we built our empire on the blood of others . 
  because foreign intervention has worked so well in our recent history . 
  wait !, 
  our involvement in them has . 
   most of our countries ethnic conflicts around the world stopped ** after the 50 's , ** aside from northern ireland . 
  also  we carved kuwait out of iraq . 
  kuwait has been very successful, 
  most of our countries ethnic conflicts around the world stopped after the 50 's , aside from northern ireland . 
  wow thanks for the in depth reply . 
  if it can argued well ( likely ) and russia does n't get in the way ( unlikely ) i can see a re-unification of romania and moldova happening . 
  just googled it and transnistria population is declining , also there is a sizable russian and ukrainian population in transnistria ( although that may include the troops ) . 
  so eventually there population will fall to the point where it would be uneconomical to not rejoin . 
  unless russia creates an inland kaliningrad ( highly unlikely ) . 
  i wonder if the russian bases would do something ? 
  always fucking around with ethnic groups . 
  then why is n't there a movement for unification ? , is it transnistria ? 
  is there an ethnic and/or cultural difference between a moldovan and a romania ? 
  the bad one ( the belgians ) . 
  charles i , tried to rule without parliament , arrested mp 's and ultimately caused the english civil war ( which also affected scotland and ireland ) . 
  in school for 5 years you have to to take a foreign language , after that a large majority of people dropped french/german class saying it was pointless as most europeans speak english . 
  calm down gerrard , you know the scouse stereotype of being thieves and criminals . 
  i could have said any city the ones you mentioned , swansea , glasgow , newcastle , middlesbrough or * shudders * dundee . 
  no country is perfect , france has the parisians , italy the neapolitans , the british the liverpudlians and the belgians have the belgians . 
  think , if did n't you would be like canada and have liz as your head of state . 
  i know i was just joshing . 
  but incase i did n't know i would know [ now . 
  well scottish gaelic is recognised by the scottish government and is on every sign ( even the areas which never spoke gaelic , like my city ) . 
  gaelic can be taught in schools ( as one of the first languages ) if the parents want it in some parts of scotland ( west and isles ) . 
  there is also gaelic tv station . 
  gaelic is also spoken in some parts of eastern canada . 
  there is also scots , the language spoken mainly in the north-east ( my area ) and it has a sister language called ulster-scots in northern ireland , although scots is n't legislated for . 
  scots is mainly spoken in the countryside and is usual in a dialect called doric , which is somewhat spoken in my city ( aberdeen ) . 
  in my city some doric words are part of the local dialect , even though most people ca n't speak doric . 
  here are some examples ; far aboots ? 
  = where abouts ? 
  min = men . 
  fit = what ? 
  fit 's adee ? 
  = what 's wrong ? 
  gies = give . 
  = what are you doing ? 
  fa = who ? 
  how did the colonials win the independence ? 
  i put them as two points because the tories and ukip ca n't vote to leave the eu , the british people can . 
   at the end of the day , we wo n't know what will happen until it happens . 
  true  but i 'd rather have to reapply to join europe not being part of the eu would kill scottish business . 
   than be a part of the broken system that is the uk . 
  we scots should try fix it then , we are an inventive bunch after all . 
   snp looks to be very strong after the elections , true , they are expected to win most of scotland . 
   which will more than likely usher in westminster reform , because their beloved fptp system will have allowed a scottish only party to become the third largest in the uk . 
  not to mention the holyrood system being designed to prevent an overall majority , yet the snp managed that , i hope to see the end fptp , and the ushering in of stv . 
   exciting times , no matter which way you look at it . 
  i agree . 
   you never know , in 20 years the politics in the uk could be such that even i would n't vote for independence . 
  i hope so . 
   but as long as fptp exists , with the snp , lib dems , ukip , plaid and the greens having a larger role this hopefully will come about sooner . 
   the house of lords exists , i support the lords . 
   and the possibility of ukip or the tories holding more power well that is democracy , having different viewpoints represented . 
   and voting to leave the eu , recent polls have shown that the uk would stay , albeit marginally . 
   then i will be against them and the uk . 
  dont be against the uk , be against the westminster establishment . 
  the english , welsh and northern irish are just as fed up . 
   because it was asked time and time again during the referendum and it was answered time and time again during the referendum . 
  scotland has just as much right to the pound as england does as the current iteration was put into effect during the union of the countries , england does n't own it any more than we do , plus we have our own banks and our own printed notes . 
  so in the event of an independent scotland ** if ** we got into a currency union we would have our monetary policies dictated to by the bank of england ? 
   we are already a member of the eu and they are not an organisation hell bent on throwing members out , so we would have likely joined with the same documents we hold with the uk just reworked for us as an independent state ( obviously at this time we will never know this either way ) . 
  if we became independent we would not be be a part of the eu . 
   second , i just want to recall some of the principles that would apply in such a scenario . 
  the separation of one part of a member state or the creation of a new state would not be neutral as regards the eu treaties . 
  the european union has been established by the relevant treaties among the member states . 
  the treaties apply to the member states . 
  if a part of the territory of a member state ceases to be a part of that state because that territory becomes a new independent state , the treaties will no longer apply to that territory .
