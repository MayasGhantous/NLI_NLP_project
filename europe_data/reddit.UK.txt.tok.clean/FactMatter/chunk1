yes , and we also want to have control over immigration of eu citizens . 
  * comprende ? 
  it 's as clear as day you 're desperately trying to weasel out of actually responding to any points and argue against a straw man . 
  got something to hide ? 
   was `` you cherrypicked data '' too clever an indictment ? 
  so let me get this straight : cherrypicking is now defined as using the most recent data we have available ( which also conforms with the last decades trends ) , but not * actual * cherrypicking of nigeria as though it is representative of the rest of the world ? 
  do us a favour . 
  which year would you prefer i use ? 
  which year better reflects ( your ) reality and we 'll discuss that instead ? 
   are you aware of what the economy is and how badly it would be affected if we lost 50 % of our exports ? 
  source that we will lose all 50 % of our exports ? 
   you 've got no idea about labour shortages in this country , do you ? 
  just say that and i 'll let you away without pointing out how much the nhs relies upon foreign workers . 
  i 'm sorry , are you under the impression that i was implying the nhs * does n't * have a shortage of labour ? 
  yes , the nhs relies upon foreign workers because we have a labour shortage of nhs staff in the uk . 
  which part of that do i need to dumb down further for you ? 
   yes , your nightmare is reality : irish , polish and german people can come to our country and live here . 
  and we 're better for them , because they 're better educated and better trained than non-eu migrants and refugees , and they 're net contributors to society . 
  hooray for rational policy !, 
  wait , do you think i 'm advocating free movement of people with nigeria and paskistan ? 
  no , i 'm supposing we set a global standard and it 's up for that particular individual , wherever they come from in the world , to meet that requirement . 
  might well mean we end up with more germans than nigerians , but at least we 're ( a ) not discriminating based on where you 're born and ( b ) everyone who comes here is qualified ( because apparently you think there 's no such thing as a below average german ) . 
  should we also be subjecting universities to your same xenophobic policies ? 
  `` 3a * s please . '' `` but i 'm a white european '' `` oh well in that case , come on through !, 
  clearly average statistics for your country shows that you , an individual , must be therefore qualified for this course . '' good luck with that . 
    what 's the evidence that eastern european migrants residing in the uk are more skilled than non-eu migrants residing in the uk ? 
   i want to make sure you 're contesting this . 
  i want to make you out yourself as bigoted against those devolved reds in eastern europe and their corrupt communist countries devoid of worth or training . 
  please do so now : so contesting that x has met its burden of proof must mean that y is being asserted ? 
  any more logical fallacies you want to commit in this discussion ? 
  so if at cambridge university they had an open door policy for white europeans , but a minimum academic requirement for nigerians , you 're wanting me to take it on blind faith that the white european students are more more intelligent than the nigerian students attending that same university ? 
  you 're * seriously * wanting to me to accept that because the education index of germany is higher than pakistan , that this somehow means that it is more likely that german student at cambridge is superior to a pakistani student at cambridge ( when it was only the latter which had to prove his academics whilst the former just walked in no-questions-asked ) ? 
  and that makes * me * the bigot ... now those are some mental hoops i just * have * to see you jump through . 
  now , stop dancing around , provide with me the evidence . 
   those damn irish , poles and germans free to move around as they are , oh how it irks me . 
   we have less eu migrants than from elsewhere in the world , and they 're better educated and trained on the whole . 
  hooray for rational policy !, 
  yes ? 
  because the higher the immigration we have from freedom of movement , the tighter the restrictions we have to impose on non-eu countries if we wish to control net migration ? 
  whether we actually require a * particular * eu worker 's services or not , or whether they are less qualified than an individual outside of the eu performing the same service , we * have * to prioritise them over a non-eu worker . 
  thanks eu !, 
  * `` but do n't worry , u/theflashyfinger takes great pride in ensuring us there are no individuals outside of the eu that can provide services greater than a below average white european ! '' *  you know what traders and citizens love in a common travel area ? 
  months and months wasted in paperwork . 
  well done / u/factmatter you 've done it again !, 
  * agh those dreaded forms , why did n't i think of it first !, 
  * suppose there 's no point in being able to control the quantity or quality of eu labour if they have to fill in forms like * everyone * else and like they would in * every * other country of the world . 
  * `` yeah but that 's far right bigotry !, 
  '' * the wee flashyfinger purrs  blown up on the gambit that irish , poles and germans are less educated than pakistanis , nigerians and bangladeshis great , a point * i * was n't making , and the point * you * did n't make . 
  you very specifically said the ** migration we get ** from those countries . 
  our uk parliament is in a position to ** set the minimum requirement ** for those countries , which they can increase or decrease , which we do n't get to set for those in the eu ( which is apparently ok because you 're unaware that normal distributions exist whereby people actually * do * deviate from the average ) . 
   except the migration we get from eastern europe is both smaller and more skilled than that from outside the eu even with total control over that exact same immigration . 
  how can you even justify this ? 
  you want me to justify a claim you are yet to substantiate ? 
  are you feeling alright ? 
  # hmm ... hmm , let 's a keep close eye on whether u/theflashyfinger * actually * addresses these fundamental points this time : * can the uk parliament control the quantity or quality of eu migrants ? 
  * do we have to discriminate against non-eu citizens if we want to cater for eu citizens ? 
  * do you have evidence that eu citizens in the uk , who did n't have to meet any requirements to come here , are more skilled than the non-eu citizens in the uk , who * did * have to meet requirements to come here ? 
  * should * all * eu citizens have the right to come to the uk , irrespective of their skillset ? 
  * should we judge people based on their individual merits , or from their country of origin ? 
   it 's ahistorical in that it 's a recent ( as in the past single-digit number of years ) trend . 
  and your point is what exactly ? ... 
  that we should only evaluate what level eu immigration * used * to be ? 
  you know , before the accession of a number of poor , post-communist states ? 
  i suppose that would be more convenient for you , yes . 
   decades ago you would have been leveraging the same complaint against the chinese , pakistani or irish . 
  look at you , brave and brazen defender of england . 
  would i ? 
  would you like to argue against my actual position or a presumed position ? 
  i understand that when one has no basis for their arguments they tend to favour the latter . 
  i would only complain if it was freedom of movement . 
   india , pakistan , south africa , nigeria and bangladesh are the largest non-eu contributors to migration . 
  surprised , no ? 
  again , and your point is what exactly ? 
  that 's up to parliament ; the quantity or quality of eu migrants * is n't * up to parliament . 
   yes we do n't want those dirty irish and germans coming over here and burning out all the polish families before the brexiters can , eh ? 
  so just to confirm : * any * eu citizen should have the right to come to the uk , irrespective of their skill set , just not filthy non-eu citizens who should have to prove their worth first ? 
   okay / u/theflashyfingerprick [ -75 ] listen , you and i both know i fucked up there . 
  i did . 
  it turns out i ca n't type . 
  it 's my vice okay ? 
  i was beaten if you must know . 
  not as a child , of course , i mean last wednesday at the desire dungeon . 
  anyway the point is i 'm too proud to admit my mistake so i 'm going to cock my brow , puff my chest and try my best to ignore it , allright ? 
  oh just stop you meanie bobeanie , you 're almost starting to hurt my feelings now  okay so what you wanted to hide with flowery language was `` yes i admit that most eu citizens are more educated and skilled than economic migrants from eritrea and south sudan but look , there have got to be some that are n't , right ? '', 
  ( 1 ) i 'm still waiting for a source for that ? 
  i 've given you a couple hours , surely you must have found something by now ? 
  ( edit ) just to clarify for you : what 's the evidence that eastern european migrants residing in the uk are more skilled than non-eu migrants residing in the uk ? 
  ( you know , that point you 're desperately trying to pretend did n't happen ) ( 2 ) even if it were true that eu citizens were , on ** average ** , more educated and skilled than those latter countries ( edit : talking generally now , not those specifically residing in the uk ) , why you think that should mean * all * eu citizens get the right to come to the uk is beyond me . 
  we should be judging people on their individual merits , not collectively stereotyping like i can see you 're keen to advance . 
  every individual ( from wherever you come from ) should have to meet the same requirements ; not `` well on average your countries better , so feel free to come in no questions asked ; you however , you come from nigeria , can i see your qualifications ? '', 
   50 % of all british exports go to the eu . 
  still waiting for that source on the crashing of the economy ... ? 
   access to the this market depends upon the four freedoms being upheld you do realise that there 's a difference between access and membership , * right * ? 
   yes . 
  talk about those . 
  now . 
  nhs has a labour shortage . 
  what 's the next step in your grilling ? 
   i literally already linked this to the poster i was talking to before you jumped into the conversation , bald-forehead a-glisten . 
  here 's a source , here 's another , i 'm sure you 'll take this all on board and we 'll all hear some civil and enlightened responses from you .
