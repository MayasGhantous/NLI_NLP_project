they also burnt nessie . 
  those monsters . 
  just the usual .

   i thought scotland did n't have that , but i realise the whole of uk votes with the same system for the general elections . 
  yeah , scotland uses fptp for the general elections , but uses [ ams ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/additional_member_system ) for the holyrood elections . 
  first past the post . 
  the states has an even more fucked up version of it . 
  you can secure the presidency with only 32.1 % of the vote over there , due to the way fptp and the electoral college work . 
  you may want to elaborate on what snp stands for . 
  it has a pretty different meaning here to what you 're probably thinking of . 
  poverty + alcohol + smoking . 
  parts of glasgow have a lower life expectancy than the gaza strip . 
  [ cullen skink ] ( http://www.cndoscotland.com/assets/img/recipes/full/cullen-skink.jpg ) soup made with cream , potatoes and smoked haddock . 
  absolutely love it when made properly ; but some many places go ultra-cheap on the ingredients . 
  the snp have been a mainstay party of scottish politics for over a decade now . 
  they can hardly be considered `` populist '' at this point . 
  the western isles . 
  the outer hebrides in particular are overwhelming catholic ; one of the few areas in the uk that still observe the sabbath ; even the ferries are affected on sunday . 
  however , i do n't really know how `` conservative '' they are , outside of religion . 
  the local councils are almost entirely lib dem / snp dominated , and again , beyond religion i do n't really think they could be considered `` backwards '' per se ( although i 'm hardly the expert on that ) . 
  the most backwards area in scotland in terms of conservatism is probably the scottish borders ; it 's a sparsely populated area full of nothing much but farmers . 
  she who must not be named . 
  just snp ones . 
  labour , lib dems and conservatives all follow the party whip . 
  haha . 
  christ that 's amusing . 
  no we have n't . 
  we 're not going to get anything meaningful . 
  hell , according to miliband [ `` there are more important things than devo max '' ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1339172/miliband-more-important-things-than-devo-max ) the only thing they 've been doing lately is making noise about banning scottish mps voting on `` english only issues '' to solve the west lothian question . 
  sounds fair right ? 
  yes and no . 
  the difficulty is due to the way funding works in the uk , there are no real `` english only issues '' , as changes made in england could have an adverse effect on funding matters in scotland ; which would force us to make changes because westminster made them down south ; even if we voted not to . 
  the other matter is the fact they promised to deliver a `` united proposal '' from all three parties ; but it took them literally a day to start in-fighting among themselves . 
  mark my words . 
  they 're going to get too worried about ukip in the general election and fail to do anything meaningful , which is going to anger a lot of people up here . 
  labour are then going to be punished - hard - up here in their so-called `` stronghold '' and lose a lot of votes to the various other parties in scotland . 
  polling shows that the snp gain significantly in westminster ; they 've overtaken labour for the first time ever in a general election with 34 % of the vote . 
  now - that - is going to be interesting . 
  english colonists and tourists . 
   according to whom ? 
  labour is not a centre-right party . 
  reality . 
  labour are just the tories with a different tin of paint these days . 
  `` new labour '' does n't have much to relate it to the labour or old . 
  scottish gaelic and it 's efforts are entirely different to those of irish gaelic . 
  i can assure you that on the western isles in scotland , gaelic is still spoken equally as much as english , and in many cases is the preferred language of communication between locals . 
  forget the forth road bridge ; i was genuinely surprised the [ glenfinnan viaduct ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01722/glenfinnan-railway_1722558i.jpg ) was n't in there . 
   gaelic is very rare to be spoken at all in most of scotland maybe ; but in the area the map has it covering , particularly the western isles , it is spoken very commonly , occasionally even as a first language . 
  gaelic is n't as dead as people seem to think it is . 
  [ it 's missing scots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scots_language ) ; which is arguably the defacto language in large parts of rural north-eastern scotland , under the doric dialect . 
  aberdeen being the natural exception , but still fairly common there . 
   nobody speaks gaelic in the british isles , it died out hundreds of years ago . 
  try telling most of the western isles that the language they speak does n't exist . 
  [ the council name is even in gaelic man ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comhairle_nan_eilean_siar ) ; come on . 
  the vast majority of people on / r/europe are from the uk , according to the surveys done on here previously . 
   federal british isles not going to happen . 
  there 's no real political will for those in westminster to bother . 
  the voting base they aim for in the south-east simply do n't care about the idea of federalising the country . 
  there might be massive support for it in wales , scotland and the north of england ; but i seriously doubt much effort will be put into it . 
  heck , it only took miliband a day to drop the proposed devolution timetable for scotland and declare [ `` there are more important matters '' ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1339172/miliband-more-important-things-than-devo-max ), 
  would be lying if i said i was n't disappointed . 
  i can live with it though . 
  hopefully the fact that 45 % of the population voted yes will be enough to kickstart some kinda of reform in the uk ; but i 'm honestly pretty dubious . 
  hell , i doubt we 'll even get the extra devolved powers we were promised in the event of a no vote . 
  yes, 
  the telegraph quoting burns in support of the union is an amusing thought . 
  this is the man who wrote parcel of rogues . 
  not really . 
  it 'd probably have support in scotland and perhaps wales , but i do n't really think it 'd gather much of a following in england . 
  not to mention that the powers-that-be would be overwhelmingly against it . 
  too much change for their liking . 
   i really hope nato does not admit another freeloading member , regardless of how improbable an attack is . 
  it would be rather weird if they did n't include scotland ; they hold a key defensive position for an area in the north sea called the something `` gap '' ( i ca n't remember the name of it at the moment , sorry ) . 
  i 'd personally go for a man 's a man for a ' that : / flower of scotland can get a bit dirge-y at times . 
  if he 's who i 'm thinking of ; he said he would eat his pubes if the yes vote won . 
   australia has even gone as far as calling scotland an enemy of freedom . 
  tony abbott did . 
  that 's not exactly a ringing endorsement the `` no '' campaign wants . 
   same for ni . 
  a huge amount of them identify as british . 
  an interesting point that has been made is that most of the loyalists derive their `` britishness '' from their scottish ancestry . 
  so if scotland leaves ; where does that place them ? 
  ** [ scotland ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/scottish_parliament_election_2011_map.svg ) ** yellow is the [ scottish national party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_national_party ) red is the [ scottish labour party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_labour_party ) blue is the [ scottish conservative party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_conservative_party ) and orange is the [ scottish liberal democrats ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_liberal_democrats ), 
  when we 've had these points repeated , over and over and over and over and over again it begins to wear a bit thin every time they turn out to be largely speculative hogwash . 
  no nation in the eu can be forced into using the euro due to the way the ecrm ii works . 
  perhaps scotland will be obligated in the negotiations to join the euro ; oh well . 
  we 'll join it eventually , just like the swedish krona , the polish zloty , the hungarian forint , the czech koruna , etc. 
  as to schengen ; it wo n't happen . 
  not because i 'm sticking my head in the sand , but because from a logical stand-point it would make absolutely no sense for the uk to force scotland into the schengen ; as the only country it shares a land border with is n't part of the schengen . 
  what on earth would they achieve from that ? 
  it would n't tear down a border , it would simply add another one , which is completely contrary to the entire point of the schengen . 
  he was n't doing it for his or their benefit . 
  he was shouting out to the constantly changing crowds as he passed . 
  it 's not funny if you watch a video of you repeating it for 10 minutes ; but it 's pretty funny if you 're only hearing it once or twice as you pass . 
  it was n't for their , or his benefit . 
  it was for the benefit of the crowds he was passing . 
  they were going past an entirely different group of people every 15 seconds or so . 
  we 've been told they 'll have to bomb paisley airport to stop terrorists taking it over . 
  we 've been told scotland going independent will be a victory for `` the forces of darkness '' ( yes that is a direct quote ) .
