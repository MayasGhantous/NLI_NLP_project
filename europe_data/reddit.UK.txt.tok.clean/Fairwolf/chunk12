  are you being serious ? 
  it 's a load of pish , that 's what . 
  both in terms of the `` breaking up britain '' and the `` breaking up europe '' section . 
  i 've heard more cohesive arguments farted out of sarah palin . 
   also the us is 5 times bigger than the uk which means bigger media -  more chance of errors happening . 
  ... what ? 
  both are international news agencies , so they cover news world-wide , not just within their own nation , but if we 're talking in terms of employees , well :  it is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees , with about 23,000 staff . 
  it happens . 
  there 's a bit of a difference between the occasional mix up , which i do n't really care about , and the constant mix-ups the american media seem to got through . 
  i 've seen countless images of countries being in the wrong place , cities being completely off in the wrong direction and other bollocks like that . 
  they 're major news corps , you 'd think they 'd be able to check an atlas . 
  corrected the spelling of ` atlas ' for the ever so insistent ones . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  the american media make these map slips all the bloody time . 
  how on earth do they keep mucking it up ? 
  i remember seeing london in norfolk one time and glasgow was somewhere near newcastle, 
  it 's not just gaelic , manx and scots both have a lot of norse influences as well . 
  allow me to show you a leaflet that was passed out at the stuc yesterday in scotland . 
  http://i.imgur.com/paek3lo.jpg take note , the insane craziness within . 
  some people genuinely believe it . 
  unfortunately . 
  it was repressed during the so-called `` age of enlightenment '' . 
  admittedly it did n't get it as bad as gaelic though , gaelic was literally beaten out of kids at school , right up until about the 40s . 
  that being said , both my grandparents speak a reasonable amount of scots , and they do n't call it `` oranger '' . 
  must be a specific regional thing then , because it 's just `` orange '' up here in aberdeen . 
  the efa group . 
  specifically due to the snp participation in it . 
  that being said , i do support their policies overall , with an occasional exception . 
  i 'm fairly certain we just call it `` orange '' up here . 
  even gaelic and scots do n't call it `` oranger '', 
  i 'm afraid i do n't know , all i know is that it 's somewhere in the scottish highlands , the picture came off of national geographic . 
  it 's a bit out of the way , but edinburgh , scotland . 
  it 's a fantastic looking city with a fair amount of stuff to do . 
  scottish summer are hit-and-miss however . 
  following on from that , the highlands are stunning and well worth the visit . 
  the only real downside is midges . 
  if you do n't know what midges are , imagine mini-mosquitoes that are completely silent , almost invisible to the naked eye ( except in swarms ) and bite you in swarms that on average reach 40,000 . 
  ** edit : ** stirling might also be worth a visit as well , for the wallace monument and stirling castle , also : [ just ] ( http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/pics/edinburghlong.jpg ) [ some ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/stirling_castle_and_sorroundings.jpg ) [ pictures ] ( http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3135/3100342171_4655c921c9.jpg ) [ of ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wxyeg.jpg ) [ scotland ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bzuaxamcwug/t92200ldt7i/aaaaaaaaepe/lx4y6kw_jfu/s1600/glencoe-scotland.jpg ), 
  uk ( for now ) . 
  i have no real desire to leave scotland , barring perhaps job related problems , as the scottish games industry is pretty starved at the moment , the uk government just do n't fucking get it the way the canadian and us government 's do . 
  it 's not being held tomorrow , is it ? 
  it 's being held in a year and a few months . 
  the february ipsos mori poll saw an increase in independence support of 6 % , the march tns bmrb poll saw a decrease in `` no '' support of roughly 5 % and an increase in the `` undecided '' vote of 5 % , with the `` yes '' vote staying the same . 
  i would n't count on `` better together 's '' victory being assured just yet matey . 
  tl ; dr : [ streisand effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ) . 
  http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/assets-uploaded/documents/scottishindependencepoll8april13_1365410494.pdf to my knowledge that 's the latest poll . 
  the `` no '' vote has decreased and the `` undecided / do n't know '' vote increased . 
  `` yes '' vote stayed the same . 
  same old independence debate . 
  better together 's largest donor ( who 's donated roughly half their campaign funds ) has been targeted by several people in regards to some of his rather dubious funding methods . 
  he 's got links to a serbian war criminal , arkan , and the saddam regime , and that 's only the tip of the iceberg . 
  this mostly would have been ignored by the general press , but then the moron went after the people for defamation . 
  suddenly streisand effect .

  a tale etched in blood and hard black pencil - christopher brookmyre , all his books are pretty damn good , but it was the first book of his i read . 
  new caledonia is french ? 
  to wikipedia !, 
  edit :  the british first sighted new caledonia on 4 september 1774 , during the second voyage of captain james cook . 
  he named the territory new caledonia , as the north-east of the island reminded him of scotland . 
   on 24 september 1853 , under orders from napoleon iii , admiral febvrier despointes took formal possession of new caledonia well , there 's the answer . 
  i 've been laughing at his twitter for the past half hour , it 's pretty good . 
   as a brit i insist we are the guys on the right . 
  as an englishman you mean . 
  the other parts of the country , not so much . 
  i 'd quite like gaelic ( scottish ) to be taught , but in terms of actual usefulness it 's pretty slim . 
  it 'd be an interesting language to learn none-the-less . 
  if we 're going by scots , i 'm actually quite fond of the language , i find it 's a bit more emotive than english , and it has a certain onomatopoeia behind it . 
  it 's not really actively ` taught ' , largely because people still debate whether it 's a language or not ( it is ) and because it generally is n't taken that seriously as a language , which is a pretty big shame . 
  i think scots ' decline was perhaps one of the negative features of the union , it stifled the language and culture a bit in favour of things being `` proper english . 
  it was treated as a language for the poor and en-educated , even as late as the 1940s , as shown by this quote from the scottish education board :  '' ... it is not the language of ` educated ' people anywhere , and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture '' scots did n't get it as bad as gaelic however , scots may have been scorned , by gaelic was actively oppressed . 
  kids used to get the belt for speaking gaelic in the classroom , for a long , long time . 
  a shame really , they 're both languages that should be actively encouraged and promoted , but they 're treated as inferior next to english and by a lot of people ( fuck you in this matter david mitchel ) as being `` not worth revitalizing '' . 
  half of scotland ; the [ kingdom of d\u00e1l riata ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a1l_riata ) ; but then the [ king of fortriu ( pictland ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oengus_i_of_the_picts ) conquered d\u00e1l riata . 
  so alba technically was n't an irish colony . 
  a wild swing at name guessing , since i remembered mac means `` son of '', 
  it 's an old , old username i 've been using since before reddit . 
  the ` wolf ' part refers to my forename , which supposedly means `` lover of dogs / wolves '' in gaelic , and the `` fair '' part refers to my surname , which means `` fair warrior '' ( fair as in fair hair ( blonde ) ) in scottish . 
  smith really is n't an english name per se ; from my understanding , surnames such as `` smith '' , `` tailor '' and `` fletcher '' are all derived from the professions ' their ancestors would have done . 
  blacksmithing , tailoring and fletching ( arrow making ), 
  pretty much any commonwealth citizen can join ; it 's why the gurkhas ' can be part of the british army . 
  scotland 's most common surname is smith ? 
  i do n't believe that for a second . 
  where are you getting the data for that from ? 
  edit : just looked at wikipedia , apparently it is . 
  that 's weird . 
  you really need the delivery for that joke to be good : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt2u4dlzbhe, 
  yeah , a lot of scottish cuisine get 's a load of bad flak ; most of it is pretty damn good however . 
  hell , i 've even been told deep fried mars bars are actually pretty good ; never had one myself though . 
  how are you with cullen skink ? 
  haggis is good , yeah . 
  but let 's be honest here . 
  tablet . 
  you have not lived until you 've tasted scottish tablet . 
  it is fucking amazing . 
  i 'm sure the north of england would be absolutely delighted to be left with just the south-east for company ... 
   the scots get more money per head than people in england . 
  but then london gets more money per head than scotland . 
  the exact same rhetoric could be aimed at the general public . 
  the daily mail has an average daily readership of 4.3 million . 
  i 'd be `` hesitant '' to grant any of them a vote as well , but we 're not supposed to restrict votes based on what we think of their intellectual capabilities .
