  16 is a good cut-off point . 
  they pay n.i , they can get married without their parents consent , they can leave school , they can join the army , etc , etc. 
  i 'm only eightteen myself ; and but one of two people within my friends group who give a fuck about politics and whilst there are those whom i knew who i would n't exactly consider the best placed to vote on political matters , it hardly matters ; they should equally get their say , even if i disagree with what they 're saying . 
  this is a matter that is going to have an effect on the future of the country ; and i quite firmly believe 16 and 17 year olds deserve to make their voice heard over the matter ; as it 'll be affecting them as well . 
  or perhaps you under-estimate . 
  take it with a pinch of salt ; i think this is more tavish scott stirring up shit than anyone seriously considering it . 
  edit : just noticed the author is severin carrell ; take this article with a mountain of salt . 
  it was n't really . 
  the pictish kingdom on the east coast merged with the gaelic kingdom on the west coast and formed the kingdom of alba , which later evolved into the kingdom of scotland . 
  relevant video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mktcjo4uhmw word of warning though , the video is over an hour long . 
  such a good documentary series though . 
  that was my hypothesis as well . 
  it comes from albion ; which is what britain was often referred to in latin documents . 
  crusader kings 2 meets medieval total war ii . 
  my dream game . 
  i do n't know how it is further south , but in aberdeen we very rarely have issues . 
  i know for one thing it 's incredibly amusing to watch the news down south explode into a panicked frenzy as soon as the snow starts falling . 
  chris addison sums it up nicely : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1dq_ainj9u, 
  a `` u.s. '' styled one ? 
  yepp , sounds like a bloody horrible idea . 
  especially the electoral college . 
  that thing needs to burn in a pit containing all the other terrible ideas thought up . 
  / r/totalwar pretty much the only gaming related subreddit i 'm subscribed to ; asides from the defaults . 
  apart from that though : / r/ukpolitics / r/unitedkingdom / r/scotland, 
  this magical `` secret document '' that better together have leaked that apparently `` shames the snp '' is simply an internal memo talking about the figures obr released . 
  http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/with-enemies-like-the-better-together-campaign-who-needs-friends.20449422 ( in-case you 've hit the herald 's article wall : http://politicalnewsfromscotland.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/with-enemies-like-better-together.html ) a few choice quotes from the article :  oh , well . 
  that 's it -- we 're stuffed . 
  why were n't we told this before ? 
  actually , we were . 
  that quote above is not from john swinney 's leaked report to the scottish government . 
  it is from the report by the office for budget responsibility 's fiscal sustainability report , presented to the uk coalition government in july 2012 -- and the country it refers to is the uk . 
   swinney 's `` bombshell report '' was n't about `` cutting pensions '' as some parts of the press claimed , it was about how much scotland could reasonably put into an oil fund for the future given its social-spending commitments . 
  still independence debate . 
  there is a bit of contention between the uk and scotland over the price of oil , the uk 's office for budget responsibility ( obr ) has claimed the the price of oil will steadily drop towards 2018 , but figures from several other groups in the industry : * department for energy and climate change * economist intelligence unit * national institute of economic and social research ( niesr ) * us energy information administration and * independent treasury economic model ( item club ) are all claiming otherwise . 
  their estimates vs. obr 's : http://imgur.com/v8h7a2e [ there 's also recently been a bit of a fuss over curry ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-21733514 ) ; the food standards agency is reporting that 2/3rd of lamb curries in scotland contained low quality beef instead of lamb . 
  [ the uk have also gone back on a promise to increase troop numbers in scotland by a few thousand . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-21733017 ) the only other things i can think of mentioning is that the lib dems are predicted to lose every single scottish mainland seat . 
  also the bbc have received a bit of a backlash over their misquoting various eu figures in regards to the scottish independence debate ; three in a row . 
  latvia , luxembourg and ireland , to quote myself from a previous thread : luxembourg : last tuesday , the bbc said in a story that luxembourg was the first eu country to come out against scottish independence . 
  the quote in question being `` as we are all facing serious economic and social challenges , this is a time for solidarity between member states of the eu and within member states , rather than for going separate ways . '', 
  from their foreign minister . 
  however a spokesperson for the foreign minister said he was talking about all member states , and that his comment in particular was aimed at the uk 's seeming anti-eu stance . 
  ireland : a european minister of ireland , lucinda creighton , was quoted to have said that `` scotland faced `` complex '' and lengthy negotiations to join the eu . 
  '' , mrs creighton later said her comment had been `` misconstrued '' by the bbc . 
  latvia : this one is the simplest . 
  the bbc simply chose to completely ignore the comment by the latvian foreign minister , who challenged the view that the uk would automatically gain the eu membership if scotland and the ruk separated . 
  they did n't report on it in the slightest , whilst taking the time to report the other comment he made about scotland having to reapply to the eu . 
  that about covers it . 
  i think . 
  ireland , luxembourg and latvia . 
  luxembourg : last tuesday , the bbc said in a story that luxembourg was the first eu country to come out against scottish independence .

  they did n't report on it in the slightest , whilst taking the time to report the other comment he made about scotland having to reapply to the eu . 
  their journalism quality has been slipping as of late . 
  they 've managed to misquote three foreign officials in a row on their position on scotland in the eu . 
  take it as on purpose , or an accident ; either way it shows a startling lack of either integrity and / or proofreading . 
  we 've never really got the hang of the ` unity ' thing ; our motto is : `` nemo me impune lacessit '' = no one strikes me with impunity ( english ) wha daur meddle wi me ? 
  does n't even matter . 
  when the general election comes around those votes will melt into nothing due to the nature of the fptp voting system . 
  the ukip voters will vote conservative to keep labour out and ukip will be left high and dry . 
  a dubious points . 
  scotland was a plutocracy in the 1700s , the only people who could vote were the nobles and landowners . 
  these people were bribed with land , titles and money in england if they agreed to support union . 
  the common populace were completely against the union , there were riots in the streets of every burgh for weeks before they could be subdued . 
  so technically the vast majority of the country was ` forced ' but at the same time it was agreed legally . 
  i could honestly understand the train one if the view was decent ; some of the train journeys in scotland pass through some amazing scenery . 
  between arbroath and aberdeen in particular has some pretty spectacular coastal views . 
  nice tune , yeah . 
  ( no one knows the lyrics though ), 
   your average scot 's views tie more closely with the conservatives than any other party that runs . 
  do you actually have any proof of that ? 
  fuck , how could i forget dougie maclean . 
  the usual stuff . 
  flower of scotland ( not that big a fan of using it as our national anthem , i think we could have a better song ) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vkyicdn834 scotland the brave - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os2_fw7zinq scots wha hae - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckt7qxk9-pw the common theme is they 're all about the first war of independence . 
  we 've got a few other less commonly used ones . 
  loch lomond ( runrig version ) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwun83po2u4 ( it tends to get belted out by the tartan army at sporting events ) a mans ' a man far a ' that ( also known as `` is there for honest poverty '' ) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0whifsjqaua ( song wise , it fits quite well with the scottish psyche , we 're probably one of the only nations in the world that does n't have a serious right-wing party with representation in politics ; i.e. 
  the conservative party only have 1/59 seats in holyrood . ), 
  i could put in auld lang syne , but i do n't really consider it a patriotic song , it 's more a song of international friendship than anything else . 
  4.4 % of the gdp compared to the uk 's 6.6 % of the gdp . 
   however scotland 's deficit is the same as the rest of the uk 's . 
  its rather large . 
  not entirely true . 
  during the 2007-2009 period scotland ran a surplus . 
  it - has - been running a deficit since then , but it 's still far smaller than the uk one . 
  i 've found these videos are fairly good : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtlngogxxac, 
  we 'd have to learn to speak gaelic again  .  the extent of my gaelic is `` saor alba '' ; `` alba gu brath '' and `` ciamar a tha sibh '' . 
  oh , and `` ceilidh '', 
  zilch is the answer , or more appropriately , null . 
  it 's only partially correct . 
  it 's got scots listed as being descended from old english , which is only partially correct . 
  scots has a lot of influence from scots gaelic and norse . 
  scotland appears to have gained an extra island between orkney and the shetlands, 
  i 'm not so certain . 
  a large chunk of tory voters are currently going for ukip in the polls , but the very nature of fptp means that it 'll be quite likely the ukip voters vote tory simply to keep labour out .
