  we 've been told that scotland will descend into a violent civil war . 
  we 've been told that scotland will become `` the pariah of europe '' . 
  we 've been told scotland would be invaded by russia . 
  we 've been told that public employees will be forced to learn gaelic . 
  we 've been told scotland will allow homophobia to dictate policy and introduce anti-gay legislation . 
  we 've been told that scotland will become a one party state . 
  we 've been told that we 'd become `` a terrorist threat '' . 
  we 've heard an awful lot of stupid things said about what sort of doom and gloom await it . 
  it has kind of just turned into a case of most of us not giving much of a fuck what the media has to say because they 've been the boy who cried wolf for far too long . 
  do n't be an eejit . 
  there 's a reason i put `` threat '' in speech marks . 
  rbs has n't paid corporation tax in years . 
  smaller levels of nothing is still nothing . 
   you 're quoting an it worker who happens to work for lloyds in edinburgh as evidence of what the bank plans to do ... are you serious ? 
  no ; if you could read you 'd note i was quoting him regarding the fact that he 's unconcerned by them moving hq because it has no real effect . 
   lloyds [ i 'll link the post made by someone who works at lloyds ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/2g1ji4/lloyds_will_move_its_hq_out_of_scotland_to_london/ckesdj4 ) the gist of it is that neither the yes or no voters are concerned about losing their jobs and no one there really thinks it 's a big deal . 
   standard life made the same `` threat '' at the 1979 devolution referendum and the 1997 devolution referendum . 
  all they 're doing is saying to their shareholders `` look , we 're not sitting on ours hands ! '', 
   clydesdale i 'm not actually aware of clydesdale making any statements . 
  can you link that for me ? 
  i swear on there more than on / r/scotland because there is more to swear at , 
  i think it 's reputation is outdated . 
  as far as cities go it 's actually a fairly nice place . 
  hell of a lot less violent than aberdeen at any rate ; i did n't feel particularly worried walking around the city centre late at night . 
  `` jocks '' is a derogatory term used for scottish people by posh people down south . 
  anywhere outside of london and smatterings of the south-east might as well not exist in westminster 's eyes . 
  our needs and wants are largely ignored for the most part whilst they flutter about accusing us of being `` subsidy junkies '' and `` bitter jocks '' . 
  scotland 's been investing fairly heavily into renewables for obvious reasons ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renewable_energy_in_scotland#realisation_of_the_potential ) but with access to roughly 60 % of the eu 's oil reserves we were already in a fairly good position anyway . 
  we 're currently exceeding our targets on the matter . 
  my major concern is that if we do n't vote for independence , those plans will be vastly stunted by uk spending cuts . 
  the uk government is n't particularly enthusiastic towards renewables . 
  they prefer to focus on the idea of fracking . 
  thatcher . 
  i probably wo n't be that contested on that either . 
  there is n't really a native figure in our history that gathers quite as much ire as thatcher did . 
  without a doubt . 
  the bbc may be required to be `` unbiased '' per their regulations ; but all it means is that they have to be more subtle about them , and ca n't just pull a fox news . 
  [ reminds me of another case closer to home . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willie_macrae ) left his flat in glasgow to drive to his cottage , noted to be in a fine mood ; was found dead in his car several hundred yards away from the road , with arms folded in lap , a gunshot wound to the head , and a gun found several yards away from the car which was later identified to have fired two gunshots . 
  documents were also missing from his person and his office was broken into , with the only thing being taken were copies of the after-mentioned documents . 
  deemed to be suicide . 
  it 's not even a government policy . 
  it 's the decision of the head of the scottish police force , who they pulled up from the metropolitan police to take the position . 
  do n't know why on earth he got it like . 
  policing in london is pretty damn different to policing in the rest of the country . 
  because it 's a piss take of the american eagle . 
   i believe it 's around 30 % supporting independence compared to 45 % against but the ` undecided ' section is almost around 25 % . 
  it 's closer to 35 % the different pollsters have wildly varying results for the most part . 
  tns brmb tend to have the support at the low end ( i.e. 
  30 % ) whereas panelbase and survation tend to have it at a higher end ( 40 % + ) similarly , yougov and ipsos mori are the only pollsters who have the `` no '' vote over 50 % , most other pollsters have it at around 45 %, 
   they 've trailed by an average of 12 % over the last month . 
  the average for july is 8.3 % . 
  the average for june was 10.3 %  once you take out the do n't knows in the polls then it 's roughly a 57 to 43 defeat , which is quite resounding . 
  only in yougov 's polls maybe . 
  tns brmb , survation and panelbase all have it a fair bit closer . 
  not so much poorly written as it is playing it safe . 
  that period of time was known as the dark ages for a reason , we do n't really know for sure what the case was . 
  dal riata invaded the pictish kingdom of fortriu several times over the centuries though ; and had forced fortriu to acknowledge dal riata as their overlord at certain points in history . 
  combine that with gaelic being the language of the church and i certainly view it as likely that gaelic was the dominant language ; especially since the pictish kingdom was mostly based in a small area around moray . 
  nope . 
  gaelic would likely have dominated from about 600 to 700 ad onwards due to the gaels bringing christianity with them ( and the pagan picts being converted ) . 
  parts of the country would still have spoken their older languages , but gaelic was probably the dominant language in scotland for roughly the same amount of time that scots was . 
  yeah , scots has been the dominant language since about the 1400 's . 
  but previously to that it was gaelic for 90 % of scotland , excluding parts of lothian and the borders . 
  gaelic only really started dying off in most parts of scotland during the 1300 's . 
  it was still all over the highlands until roughly the 19th century ; then , y' know . 
  highland clearances . 
  like lockerbie . 
  a scapegoat would have been quickly found , given a `` trial '' and sentenced . 
   the uk would maybe veto too to discourage scotland . 
  nope ; even westminster are n't that stupid , it would backfire monumentally . 
  you damn bloody well bet they should get their say on how their country is governed . 
  yes , it will have huge consequences for the future of scotland ; so why exactly should the people who will have to live with those consequences not get a say ? 
  stop treating the general public like they 're a bunch of children that needs daddy westminster to tell them what to do . 
  half the politicians in charge probably know fuck all about the matter compared to people in the general public who 've been paying attention to this debate for years . 
  because it 's laughable . 
  what response can you give to someone who calls what has probably been one of the most peaceful political debates in god knows how long `` scary and nasty business '' . 
  god forbid the public get to have their say on an issue ; best just leave it to the politicians in charge eh ? 
   these referendums are really scary and nasty business imo , which is why referendums should generally be avoided as they do not represent the ideal way of conducting politics `` the public are too dumb , they should leave it up to smart people like me '' . 
  in our time honoured words of tradition ; get tae fuck mate . 
  come up north ; i know it 's a bit isolated if you want to travel around the rest of europe , but it 's prime tourist season at the moment , so there will be a lot of stuff on wherever you go in scotland . 
  just beware the midges . 
  * shrug * difficult to say . 
  it might see an increase in votes from the west coast , but it 's not really possible to predict as such . 
  ** scotland ** * the celebrations for the battle of bannockburn and the british armed forces day both took place in stirling recently on the same day . 
  attendance figures appear to be wild guesses , with numbers between 2000 and 35000 being thrown around . 
  * the formed defence secretary of margret thatcher 's government has admitted that [ westminster blocked oil companies from drilling for oil off of the west coast of scotland because they did n't want it to interfere with trident . 
  ] ( http://www.sundaypost.com/news-views/politics/tories-blocked-oil-boom-in-the-clyde-heseltine-admits-1.446273 ) there is estimated to be - a lot - of oil there . 
  a former oil industry executive involved with seismic work in the area was quoted as saying that : `` ** the biggest oil-field in the world lies to the west of lewis ** , but would be very difficult to work ( but not impossible ) since it has been shattered and fragmented by ancient volcanic action . 
  but it is there `` . 
  * [ 35 years after it was officially announced , a contractor has been found for the very long awaited aberdeen bypass ] ( http://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/local/contractor-announced-for-aberdeen-s-bypass-1.416413 ) ; which was delayed due to a man ( read : enormous fucking arsehole ) who spent years in the courts battling against the bypass going past his home . 
  the man now lives in london . 
  * [ the scottish independence polls are still narrowing . 
  the latest three polls have the ` no ' vote at a lead of 17 % , 7 % , 5 % and 3 % respectively , with yougov 's 17 % being the outlier in this case . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#2014 ), 
   it 's similar to halloween , which was not a popular festival in the uk until fairly recently . 
  maybe in england . 
  guising has been pretty popular in scotland for quite some time . 
  i 've found one of the sulking ones . 
  seems to be a few of them kicking about judging by the downvotes .
