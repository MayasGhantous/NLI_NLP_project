  you 'd think so ; but some people get offended by anything . 
  because a bunch of english fans are sulking about it mainly ; which the telegraph is pandering to . 
  thought i 'd crosspost this for a variety of reasons . 
  firstly it explains a bit of the background of how scotland got to how it is today , and the controversies over those years . 
  secondly it 's in gaelic , and goidelic celtic is best celtic ( do n't worry , english subtitles included ) lastly it provides some further background for a lot of the points brought up in the current debate . 
  warning however , it 's fairly long , roughly an hour or so , and almost entirely in gaelic except for the sections in which professor gavin mccrone is speaking . 
   said who ? 
  sky news apparently . 
   it is however a tragedy that the scottish must choose the english as their enemy . 
  good thing we do n't consider the english our `` enemy '' then . 
  whatever that 's supposed to mean . 
  there have been some polls done that included something like it as an additional question ; i believe it was `` if scotland was an independent country would you vote to join the uk '' ? 
  that might be what you 're thinking of ; but it was never asked as a main question . 
   the only poll showing ` yes ' to scottish independence was an snp one asking something like `` would you sign the union act if it were presented to you tomorrow ? '', 
  no it was n't . 
  it asked the standard question . 
  the reason people reckon it got such a high percentage of the vote was because a snp minister made people aware of the poll as the polling was happening , so a good number of yes voters signed up to the panelbase site to get polled for it . 
  the obvious choice . 
  [ violently ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpxkio2p2wm#t=0m10s ), 
   if i understand it correctly the 1979 referendum was a vote for the scots , to create a devolved assembly , which there were n't sufficient votes for . 
  then you do n't understand . 
  there were enough votes , but westminster added a clause that said that anyone who did n't vote was effectively voting `` no '' . 
  that referendum was so dodgy that it 's held by the un as an example of how not to hold a referendum . 
   you make it sound like this is some kind of evil plot , with the scottish people having been hoodwinked by a political party making election promises , and then keeping them ? 
  those bastards . 
  that 's just being obtuse . 
  it was included as a vote winner , not out of some desire to see a better democratic system for scotland ; that was made patently clear by the way the 1979 included the clause and the way the parliament was set up . 
  devolution . 
  we were offered it in 1979 because labour needed snp support to win the election . 
  we were offered it in 1997 because labour needed support to win the election . 
  and yes , of course it 's a ad hominem . 
  jibes instead of arguments . 
   sit down and eat a deep fried mars bar or something , you sound angry and upset . 
  we 're going into ad hominems already ? 
  not really , just pointing out how ridiculous this statement from westminster is . 
  they can promise everything they like when their promises are worth about as much as mud . 
  if history is any precedent , we wo n't get any powers unless those powers are a bargaining chip to help either a party get to power in westminster , or a party to pass a policy . 
  it 'll be put on the back-burner and ignored otherwise . 
  and no one up here believes them for half a bloody minute , even if they intend to vote no . 
  they 've made these same promises and again and again . 
  why do n't they start actually telling us what powers they intend to give us , instead of vague hints ? 
  i 'll tell you why , because they have no intention of doing so . 
  largely thanks to the way papers down south have been reporting the independence referendum , there 's now a large part of the english populace who feel that the scots get more than they put in , and are going to be utterly opposed to any more `` favouritism '' towards the scots , which would make any attempt to devolve further power towards scotland ill-advised politically . 
  and since scotland makes up a fraction of the votes compared to england , who do you think they 'll favour ? 
  they pulled the same shit in 1979 : `` reject devolution and we 'll work towards a better deal for scotland '' . 
  yeah , 'cause that went so fucking well . 
  i give no fucks about football . 
  but the sheep are on firrrrreeeeeee, 
  yeah ... that statistic is rather absurd . 
  in no way could that be true .

  scotland has the outer-hebrides , which is kinda like our version of the bible belt , but less insane , and not very right-wing . 
  they 're just very religious for the most part ; only place in the country where literally everything is shut down on a sunday ; i believe they 're even trying to get the ferries shut down on a sunday .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doric_dialect_%28scotland%29 ) edit : link has been fixed, 
  dr fabien zuleeg of the european policy centre holds a slightly different view . 
  he does n't seem to think there 's anyway the eu could force scotland into using the euro . 
   full membership will probably take years . 
  unlikely . 
  countries seeking eu membership for the first time have to adjust to all the laws and requirements the eu sets . 
  scotland has already had these laws and requirements in place for decades , i do n't see the negotiation process taking very long , or being blocked ; and both the members of the european commission who 've actually gone into detail about the matter agree on that .

   he does n't want to be in schengen being in the schengen would be utterly pointless . 
  the only country we share a land border with is england , and being in the schengen would actually cause a border to be put up , rather than torn down , which is completely counter-productive to what the schengen area is trying to achieve . 
  the telegraph are getting really desperate now in the lengths they 'll go to try and create a smear story against salmond ; edging towards their well deserved `` daily mail-o-graph '' title .

  i 'm 1/64th scottish you know !, 
   i have no idea why in a nation of heavy drinkers we made our capital so difficult to traverse while absolutely pished . 
  good defensive tactic . 
  never know when you 'll get a punch of pished people trying to invade . 
  not really ; comparing economies of countries to mundane life situations is hardly a realistic outlook . 
  the idea of the currency union is n't so that scotland can `` take it 's cake and eat it ( even though that metaphor makes absolutely no sense ) '' , it 's to ensure there are no unnecessary barriers to trade put up between scotland and the ruk , and to ensure that things continue smoothly as possible . 
  the uk and scotland will still be trading post independence , and our economies will not diverge much in the short term , making it a fairly sensible option . 
  hell , what with the recently leak from inside the union camp , it seems that the snp are n't the only ones who believe that 's the case , what was the quote again ? 
   `` of course there would be a currency union , '' the minister told the guardian  `` there would be a highly complex set of negotiations after a yes vote , with many moving pieces . 
  the uk wants to keep trident nuclear weapons at faslane and the scottish government wants a currency union -- you can see the outlines of a deal . '', 
  my sincerest apologies for not waiting on our discourse hand-and-food , but i do occasionally like to do other things with my time . 
  i will of course divert my immediate attention to your most important of conversations . 
   but why should the ruk underwrite a foreign countries banks ? 
  because they rely on `` scottish '' banks almost more than we do .
