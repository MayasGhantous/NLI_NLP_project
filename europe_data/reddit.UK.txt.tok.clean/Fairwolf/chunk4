  if the uk had n't bailed out the `` scottish '' banks , then sure , scotland would be in a bad situation ; but the uk would have had it just as bad ; it would have been a disaster for the economy . 
  it 's the same reason they bailed out the irish banks . 
  it 's the same reason that france , belgium and the netherlands split the cost of bailing out the banks that operate in the countries between them . 
  hardly . 
  scotland is under no legal obligation to take on a share of the uk 's debt , as it is not considered a successor country to the uk . 
  any debt it decides to take on would be an moral , rather than legal obligation . 
  if the uk government want to play hardball , then they better be ready for the consequences . 
  you want to pre-negotiate and block a currency union ? 
  fine , enjoy your debt . 
  when westminster are ready to start acting like adults , then perhaps the negotiations can take place properly . 
  yeah ; refusing to honour the debt was a threat . 
  was that not patently clear ? 
  the uk government wants to play hardball with the idea of a currency union ; then they can enjoy the backlash they get from that . 
  just as the uk government predicted . 
  why oh why did n't we listen to them . 
  it seems so obvious now that russia would seek to invade us without the uk 's `` broad shoulders '' for protection :(, 
   and the panelbase number from before was at 49 % not 39 % . 
  you 're correct , mistake on my part . 
  i fail to see the point you 're making huonym . 
  if you 're trying to imply that osbourne 's speech was in any way a success for the better together campaign , then you 're delusional . 
  you gov poll pre-osbourne speech : 34 % y / 52 % n you gov poll post-osbourne speech : 37 % y / 52 % n panelbase poll pre-osbourne speech : 37 % y / 49 % n panelbase poll post-osbourne speech : 40 % y / 45 % n survation poll pre-osbourne speech : 32 % y / 52 % n survation poll post-osbourne speech : 39 % y / 48 % n we do n't respond well to threats . 
   it 's not really a ` threat ' . 
  it 's more something like you can not keep the cookie and eat it at the same time . 
  of course it 's a bloody threat . 
  `` if you split we 'll refuse to trade , or negotiate with you '' . 
  that is the textbook definition of a threat , do n't give me any bollocks about them being `` well within their rights to do so '' , it would be sheer petty childishness , which would severely hurt the economies of both nations for no fucking reason . 
   if this is communicated clearly enough the people of catalonia will vote to stay in spain . 
  if catalonia is anything like scotland in it 's attitude , then that would only drive more people to vote for independence , we do n't respond well to threats . 
   but it 's important to notice , that this winter , mas ( catalunya 's president ) , send letters asking for support to germany and other eu countries ... he was ignored . 
  no surprises there . 
  no other country is going to get involved in the debate in spain ; it would be a horrible idea politically to show support for one side or another . 
  hence it does n't really mean anything . 
  as to the eu saying they wo n't be able to join ... no they have n't ? 
  a few members of the commission have given their own personal opinions , but the only official report done on the legality of the matter ( aimed towards scotland mostly ) was blocked by the european parliament president because he believed it would `` interfere in the debate '' , whatever the fuck that is supposed to mean . 
  nah ; that 's just tavish scott waving his arms around and doing his usual . 
  the only actual poll done on the issue showed that only 8 % of people were in favour of shetland and orkney splitting from scotland . 
  it 's getting far closer than you think . 
  the latest yougov poll came out today with 37 % y , 52 % n , 11 % dk ; that 's only an 8 % swing required for the yes campaign , and yougov are typically one of the pollsters that show less favourable results for the yes campaign . 
  he really is though . 
  he 's waving the stick of `` autonomy or we 'll just stay with uk '' , but that view does not seem to be backed by any form of reality . 
  the only poll done on the issue indicated that 82 % of orkney and shetlanders backed staying with scotland . 
  they 've already had bills put in place to devolve more powers to the island councils ; tavish scott is doing this because of party politics ; it has nothing to do with benefiting the local people . 
   it would be pretty disgraceful if people went around accusing the welsh of just wanting to cause trouble . 
  no one is accusing the shetlanders of causing trouble ; it 's just tavish scott doing his usual shtick , complete and dance and song . 
  if the shetlanders are looking for more autonomy ; then as far as i 'm concerned they should get it ; but tavish scott = / = the opinions of the whole of shetland . 
  in all honesty ; if they all came north i doubt there 'd be much of an issue . 
  immigration really is n't a hot-issue up north for the most part ; we get so little of it . 
   the county contains large deposits of oil shale - the main mineral mined in estonia . 
  as oil shale is used in thermal power plants , the earth in ida-viru contains most of estonia 's energy resources . 
  yepp ; that sounds like prime putin parking space . 
  oh do fuck off . 
  they 're well within their rights to hold the referendum . 
  who gives half a fuck if the spanish government start a nasally whine over the matter ; if the referendum shows the majority of catalan 's wish to split , then as far as i 'm concerned the matter is settled . 
  `` illegal under the constitution '' my arse . 
  guess clarity is n't coming after all . 
  so much for that . 
  depends . 
  the bbc has their own agenda , they 're just required to be less obvious about it . 
  it 's timing of sorts i suspect . 
  his asylum only lasts till july in russia . 
   also , major businesses such as standard life are already talking about relocating from scotland to england if independence happens so there 's a massive risk of it back firing and drawing capital away from and not toward scotland and the north of england . 
  i would n't start drooling over the prospect of independence backfiring over that just yet . 
  it 's pretty standard procedure for the most part ; i 'd be questioning the sanity of standard life if they did n't have a contingency plan in place . 
  what they 're discussing is not `` we 'll move away if scotland goes independent '' , it 's `` we have to prepare for all possibilities to reassure our shareholders , so here 's something we 've planned for '' . 
  standard life did the same back in the devolution referendum ; it ai n't really anything new . 
  do n't even bother . 
  huonym is perhaps the single most deluded person i 've ever tried to debate with regarding independence . 
  even some of the trolls make more sense than he does . 
  he 's pretty happy to go borderline racist on occasion as well . 
  it 's like if the daily mail and the telegraph were distilled into a human avatar . 
  he has about as much relevance to the independence debate as david bowie . 
  no one really cares what he has to say . 
  i sincerely doubt it . 
  they might blow hot air over the matter given the opportunity , but it 's not a threat i see them following through with . 
  scotland remaining within the eu is pretty beneficial to most of the member states ; spain especially relies on access to the north sea for their fishing industry to survive . 
  not to mention despite westminster 's posturing , scotland outwith the eu would be incredibly damaging to the ruk . 
  anyone who attempts to block scotland 's ascension is likely going to get leaned on pretty fucking hard by other nations . 
  not saying that 'll stop them , but it wo n't be comfortable for them . 
  yeah ... and who 's going to do that ? 
  talking of spouting nonsense ... 
  anyway ; as has been pointed out in the post ** [ that already exists on this sub-reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1y1xjl/independent_scotland_difficult_if_not_impossible/ ) ** it 's barroso 's personal opinion , not that of the european commission ; and as such does n't really mean very much . 
  copy-pasting from the other posts i 've er ... posted in : i 'm going to point out that this statement is identical to the one barroso made months ago ; and is entirely his personal opinion , not that of the european commission ; nor one that all members of the commission agree with : http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/643/m05.htm, 
  it was the 80s mate . 
  fuck knows xd,

  he did the same thing half a year ago and then admitted he was talking bollocks . 
  what 's new . 
  he makes a statement filled with `` maybe '' `` possibility '' `` could be '' and then the news removed those bits of the statement to make a fancy headline . 
  just . 
  hot . 
  air . 
  [ there 's a tonne of fantastic scots ones . 
  ] ( http://scotlandwelcomesyou.com/scottish-sayings/ ) i 'll probably go with * tattybogle * however ; it 's the scots word for scarecrow , with the literal translation being `` potato monster '' . 
   braveheart ( semi-fictionalised history ) more like fiction with a bit of history in it . 
  christ that film is awful . 
   there 's a surprising lack of discussion about braveheart . 
  what ? 
  it 's pretty much all the telegraph goes on about . 
  `` the snp said something . 
  it 's obviously motivated by hatred of the english and braveheart '' .
