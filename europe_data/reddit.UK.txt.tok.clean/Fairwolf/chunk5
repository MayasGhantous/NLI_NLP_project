  we were part of an empire that ruled a 1/4th of the world . 
  if we say we 're a country of countries , then we 're a country of countries .

  and i should care why ? 
  salmond 's verging on 60 . 
  he 'll be retired from politics within a couple of years if the vote goes through . 
  his personality has absolutely zero impact on my intention to vote . 
  why should we ? 
  because you say so ? 
  nah , i 'm not in the habit of taking advice from people thousands of miles away who are utterly clueless about the issue . 
  scotland 's time to shine .

  er ... how ? 
  i 'm failing to see much embarrassing about this . 
  i live on roughly # 250 a month , which is about 301 euros . 
  it 's probably the cheapest city in britain . 
  not half bad either , despite it 's reputation . 
  meh , i 'm alright with transpotting . 
  at least it is n't braveheart . 
  aberdeen - we 're a pretty good body-double for osgiliath . 
  you think glaswegian is hard to understand ? 
  for those of you who 've seen brave , you might remember [ the guy that `` no one '' can understand ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0txmwlsple ) it 's my local dialect , and i understand it perfectly . 
  it 's a bit thicker than what most locals will have , but if you 're from aberdeen then you 're able to understand it without much of an issue . 
  i should have known . 
  my inner historian wants to slap him with something . 
  saying `` germany started the great war '' is n't just over-simplification . 
  it 's straight up in-correct . 
  jacobites rise !, 
  aye , donnie was good , but i do n't really see anything wrong with bruce , they 're both good , just different styles .

  ah joy . 
  the libertarians have arrived to lecture us on our socialist ways . 
  not really . 
  irish belongs to the goidelic language branch , welsh belongs to the brythonic one . 
  they 're pretty different for the most part . 
  [ union street , aberdeen , scotland ] ( http://www.visitscotland.com/cms-images/2x1/regions/aberdeen-shire/union-street-christmas ), 
  we can rejoice in the shittiness of our christmas tree together . 
  on a similar note , i swear they 're getting more stingy with the christmas lights on union street every year , they seem to have half the lights up compared to the numbers they had a few years ago . 
  [ aberdeen ] ( http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8231331754_3813f19ce1_z.jpg ) . 
  with christmas lights in the background on union street . 
  you 're incorrect . 
  the only place gaelic has n't been spoken in is lothian , parts of the borders , and orkney and shetland . 
  everywhere else has had gaelic as the main language at some point in it 's history , roughly around the 10th century . 
   i 'll eat my hat if they do be careful what you say on reddit . 
  lest you end up like / u/croatianpride, 
   that does not mean , i believe i 'm from the best place , that i belong to the best people you 're confusing ethnic nationalism with civic nationalism . 
  ethnic nationalism is what you 're describing . 
  civic nationalism is what the snp follow , and possibly catalonia , although i 'm not as aware of the debate over there . 
  civic nationalism is the believe in self-governance , not superiority of race or culture . 
  i fail to see why they would ... ? 
  the only discussion worth holding at this point would be with the european commission , but they refuse to give an official response until the uk government ask ; and so far they have n't . 
  i do n't see any reason they should even bother discussing the matter with cyprus and spain . 
  glad we get to hear a non-partisan voice in this debate . 
  one that has no vested interests in the outcome , and is n't making veiled threats to other areas that might be considering independence . 
  i do hope that a sarcasm tag is n't necessary . 
   which is about 100 billion actually # 92bn , if going by per-capita share , and # 56bn if going by estimated fiscal balance . 
   it 's not like it 's called the bank of england which is actually a uk bank , despite the name . 
  no ; they have n't . 
  barroso gave his personal opinion . 
  you 'll note however that it was his personal one , and several other members of the european commission have offered entirely different views on the matter . 
  the eu , nor the european commission , have offered an official view yet . 
  so ; ethnic nationalism , not civic nationalism ? 
  no , no , no , no , no , no , no . 
  do not make that mistake . 
  nah , it 's a quality drop because that 's what it 's had . 
  it went from being the main force behind digging up the information on the mp 's expenses scandal to posting stories about `` dem immurgrants ar takin our jerbs '' . 
  oh lovely . 
  a telegraph article . 
  although , i feel the phrase `` mailograph '' might better fit it 's recent quality drop . 
   that , at least , is the view of their respective lib dem msps tavish scott and liam mcarthur . 
  what did i just say in the post above ? 
  it 's tavish scott stirring shit because he can . 
  the poll i linked clearly suggests that tavish scott is talking bollocks . 
  what the islanders have made calls for in the past is greater autonomy for their councils , which the scottish government have promised to do . 
  really , care to actually link that dear ? 
  instead of just downvoting . 
  because you 're seriously lacking any form of evidence of your claims at the moment . 
  and here 's a hint . 
  tavish scott does n't represent the majority view of orkney and shetland . 
  he represents his own interests . 
  really ? 
  because when the poll question `` should shetland/orkney be independent countries , separate from scotland ? '', 
  was asked , 82 % said `` no '' , 10 % said `` do n't know '' and 8 % said `` yes '' . 
  ca n't be that big a party . 
  oh wait ... you do n't think that the `` independent '' mps are part of some shetland independence party do you ? 
  because that would be both equally hilarious and sad . 
  no , that 's not how it goes . 
  the free higher education is - not - supposed to be for everyone in the eu , only scotland , but due to the way the eu works , what advantages we give our students , we have to give it to eu students as well , hence , we have to pay for their tuition fees in scotland . 
  the reason england , wales and northern ireland do n't get there 's paid is because they 're part of the same country as scotland , and as such do n't count as a separate eu member for which this clause should apply to . 
  it 's got fuck all to do with `` excluding the english '' . 
  an opinion piece . 
  'cause frankly the debate needs more of those . 
  edit : it also appears that upon trying to re-read the article i get stuck behind a paywall / registration wall . 
  no thanks . 
  irish is from a rather unique language group . 
  the vast majority of languages in european can be related to three specific language families : latin , germanic and balto-slavic , however irish belongs to the goidelic language family , and only shares it with scottish gaelic and manx gaelic , leading it to be a bit different in structure to most other european languages . 
  currently , if you study in scotland then you wo n't have to pay any tuition fees .
