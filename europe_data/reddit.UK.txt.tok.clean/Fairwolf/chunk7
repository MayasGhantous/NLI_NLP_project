   but older voters yepp . 
  saw that one coming a mile away . 
  it 's certainly easy to proclaim it `` a duty '' when you 're not the one doing the `` duty '' . 
  yeah , they seem to have a pretty big following in other parts of europe , germany and the various scandinavian countries especially . 
  [ they even did a song about scandinavia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7aakl4oexc ), 
  in terms of gaelic , the only group that had even a chance of chart success in the 80s was runrig . 
  the trouble however , is that we only have the uk charts , and england , wales and n.i. 
  would have very little interest in gaelic . 
  hence , no gaelic big hits . 
  i think runrig maybe peaked at about # 31 in the 80s . 
  their over-all peak was # 9 with loch lomond in 2007 . 
  but yeah , the rest of the country do n't give a fuck about gaelic , so the chances of it , or scots for that matter , reaching anywhere near `` big hit '' status is about nil . 
  edit : at the request of khthon : [ runrig - alba ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbj_bexv7po ) [ runrig - tir an airm ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3glotmd39u0 ) [ runrig - an toll dubh ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4elz0qu7li ) [ runrig - cnoc na feille ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgrwf2gfbp8 ) [ runrig - o cho meallt ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddaombzfoz4 ) those are most of their big gaelic 80s songs , they 've done a fair few others after the 80s , but that 's the 80s for now . 
  it 's a bit out-dated . 
  the wikipedia article has the most recent ones : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#two_option_polling, 
  doubt all you want . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#two_option_polling ( the ipsos mori one was only added today , so at the time of my posting the most recent three were the ones i posted . ), 
  nah , the most recent three were : 1 . 
  32 % ( yes ) 49 % ( no ) 19 % ( undecided ) 2 . 
  37 % ( yes ) 47 % ( no ) 16 % ( undecided ) 3 . 
  44 % ( yes ) 43 % ( no ) 13 % ( undecided ), 
  ... and the hebrides , the outer hebrides , aberdeenshire , orkney , caithness , sutherland , mull and so on . 
  basically everywhere except the central belt had some contact with the vikings . 
  apart from in aberdeenshire , strangely . 
  [ one such view ] ( https://ssl.panoramio.com/photo/74482377 ), 
  because once people are granted eu citizenship , it 's incredibly hard to remove it . 
  a special treaty had to be written up for greenland to allow them to leave the eu . 
  there is no precedent for removing eu citizenship from citizens , and presently , catalonia 's citizens have eu citizenship . 
   this is a question that has not been answered , yet . 
  perhaps if scotland votes to secede next year the commission will be forced to answer the question , but i suspect spain ( or indeed the uk ) is n't willing to formally ask them to do so before they absolutely have to . 
  catalonia is holding their vote a week before us . 
  it 'll prove an interesting affair , as things will look rather bad for spain if they veto catalonia , but allow scotland through , on the flip side of the coin , they ca n't afford to veto scotland , as a tonne of their fishing industry operates in the north sea .

  ignore him . 
  the bloke 's a neo-nazi and completely off his fucking rock . 
  just take a look through his post history . 
  bloody crazy eejit . 
  [ a history of scotland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_history_of_scotland ) . 
  as the name implies , it 's a documentary about the history of scotland , starting from the roman era , all the way to the modern era . 
  there are ten episodes , each an hour long and , in my personal opinion , they 're all fantastically well made . 
  pretty much all the episodes are up on youtube : [ episode 1 : the last of the free ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mktcjo4uhmw ) - at the dawn of the first millennia , there was no scotland or england . 
  in the first episode oliver reveals the mystery of how the gaelic scottish kingdom - alba - was born , and why its role in one of the greatest battles ever fought on british soil defined the shape of britain in the modern era . 
  [ episode 2 : hammers of the scots ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnrevrrialg ) - oliver charts the 13th century story of the two men who helped transform the gaelic kingdom of alba into the scotland of today . 
  while alexander ii forged scotland in blood and violence , william wallace 's resistance to king edward i of england hammered national consciousness into the scots . 
  [ episode 3 : bishop makes king ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7fmfuffciu ) - robert bruce 's 22-year struggle to secure the scots ' independence is one of the most important chapters in scotland 's story . 
  oliver explores the role the scottish church played in promoting robert bruce , the propaganda campaigns , both at home and abroad , and how the 1320 declaration of arbroath persuaded the pope to finally recognise scotland as an independent nation . 
  [ episode 4 : language is power ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz63n_a_0cq ) - at one time , gaelic scotland - the people and the language - was central to the identity of scots . 
  but as oliver reveals , scotland 's infamous highland/lowland divide was the result of a family struggle that divided the kingdom . 
  this is the story of how the policies of the stewart royal family in the 15th century led to the gaels being perceived as rebels and outsiders . 
  [ episode 5 : project britain ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7v0w6a-_uu ) - oliver describes how the ambitions of two of scotland 's stuart monarchs were the driving force that united two ancient enemies , and set them on the road to the great britain we know today . 
  while mary queen of scots plotted to usurp elizabeth i and seize the throne of england , her son james dreamt of a more radical future : a protestant great britain . 
  [ episode 6 : god 's chosen people ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka0edfhysyc ) - neil oliver continues his journey through scotland 's past with the story of the covenanters , whose profound religious beliefs were declared in the national covenant of 1638 . 
  this document licensed revolution , started the civil war that cost king charles i his head , cost tens of thousands of scots their lives and led to britain 's first war on terror . 
  [ episode 7 : let 's pretend ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbw39e4qxg ) - bitterly divided by politics and religion for centuries , this is the infamous story of how scotland and england came together in 1707 to form great britain . 
  over time the union matured into one of the longest in european history , but it very nearly ended in divorce . 
  exploiting the union 's unpopularity , the exiled stuarts staged several comebacks , selling themselves as a credible and liberal alternative to the hanoverian regime . 
  neil oliver reveals just how close they came to succeeding . 
  [ episode 8 : the price of progress ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfdbkworyi4 ) - through the winning and losing of an american empire and the impact of the scottish enlightenment , neil oliver reveals how in the second half of the 18th century scotland was transformed from a poor northern backwater with a serious image problem into one of the richest nations on earth . 
  this was the dawn of the modern age when scotland made its mark on the world by exporting its most valuable commodities - its people and ideas . 
  [ episode 9 : this land is our land ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct7y-x99krw ) - at the start of the 19th century , everything familiar was swept away . 
  people fled from the countryside into the industrial towns of scotland 's central belt . 
  rural workers became factory workers - in some of the worst conditions in europe . 
  this new scotland became a seedbed of revolution . 
  but it was n't just force that kept the scottish people in their place , it was fantasy . 
  neil oliver reveals how sir walter scott created so powerful a myth , it haunts the scots collective imagination to this day . 
  [ episode 10 : project scotland ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhn6zsymw_s ) - as a partner in the british empire , scotland began the 20th century with an advanced economy and a world-beating heavy industry . 
  but in the closing decades its sense of britishness was in doubt and a scottish parliament sat in edinburgh for the first time since 1707 . 
  charting scotland 's darkest century , neil oliver discovers a country driven to self-determination through a series of economic crises so deep that her most striking export became her own disillusioned population . 
  really ? 
  i was told not to drink from the tap when i was in krakow . 
  it 's been non-stop sunny in aberdeen for about two months . 
  give or take a few rainy days . 
   scotland , will have an independence referendum that will in all likelihood fail . 
  it 's still entirely up in the air . 
  the rather large 20 % undecided could go either way . 
  i 'm afraid not , it comes directly out my higher modern studies notes taken in class , and the statistics were ones we were taught by the teacher , so really nothing short of returning to my former secondary school is going to easily let me find those statistics . 
  i 'll have a look around the various education sites and see if i can find it though . 
  if i remember my modern studies statistics correctly , 2/3rds of black males in america are either dead , incarcerated or disabled by the age of 30 , and there are more black males in prison than there are in college . 
   denmark 's flag ( dannebrog ) is the oldest flag in the world used by a country oldest flag in the world used by a sovereign nation i believe . 
  the scottish saltire is said to have originated in the 800 's , but since we 're not a sovereign nation ( just now anyway ) it does n't count . 
  nope . 
  not in scotland at any rate . 
  for reasons not related to addiction . 
  to quote the government 's own reasoning they put forward for the 2005 gambling bill :  preventing gambling from being a source of crime or disorder , being associated with crime or disorder or being used to support crime  ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way , and  protecting children and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited by gambling `` harmed '' is vague , to allow the law to apply to as many different situations as the government wants , but exploited seems a bit more specific . 
  presumably to stop `` children and venerable people '' from being scammed by betting shops and casinos when they might not know better . 
  you could argue coffee has addictive qualities , do we keep kids away from coffee . 
  games can have additive qualities , are you suggesting we keep kids away from games ? 
  advocating for a soft-ban on something because it has the potential to be addictive is just idiotic . 
  that 's a study on the addictive effects of pornography , not the `` negative effects '' it has on adolescents specifically that this german politician claims exists . 
  quite a bit of difference there . 
   geis said it was proven that children and teenagers are negatively affected if they watch porn on the internet . 
  i so wish it was possible to physically walk up to these morons and call them out of their crap . 
  what fucking studies ? 
  classic tactic from the spanish government really . 
  `` corruption , what corruption ? 
  quick !, 
  look over there ! '',
