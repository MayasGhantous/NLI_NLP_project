  there is no fucking scandal . 
  lfi were teaming up with yes scotland to campaign in ayr , they took a picture together and labeled it as such , the union campaigners then took the photo , removed the caption with the names underneath , then claimed to have `` caught out '' the snp by circling their faces and linking them to their faces in other photos . 
  it was an utter clusterfuck of either complete incompetence or being willfully misleading . 
  no salvaxe , how ever much you might drool over the prospect , the polls are n't going either way . 
  the rather huge 20 % undecided could swing things either way . 
  you are the third person to post this . 
  i 've already answered it two other times . 
  quick change to my point above , i did a quick google search , and as i suspected , it was to do with gaelic translations . 
  hardly any of the common scots in those days would have spoke english , many would have spoken gaelic and the aristocracy would have spoken norman . 
  the head of gaelic clans were called `` the '' `` family name '' , so the head of the mclean clan would have been `` the mclean '' in gaelic , hence `` the bruce '' . 
  it was just his family name , i could n't tell you why he 's called `` the bruce '' exactly though . 
  probably because i was only doing ones from the wars of independence as an after thought after naming the bruce , hence this paragraph :  hell , the first war of independence had a whole raft of scottish heroes that played a part in that war , almost all of them as equally skilled tacticians as the bruce :, 
   the reason hadrian 's wall was put up was because nobody cared much about scotland . 
  it had no real value to the roman empire , nor did it to any successive invaders . 
  not entirely true . 
  the roman empire made a few attempts to expand into scotland , but every time they did they had to retreat before they could secure the land due to political issues back in rome that required their attention . 
  they put up the walls as a means of control , not necessarily to keep the highlanders out . 
  it allowed them to control trade between the north and the south and similarly restrict the flow of people . 
  the north was n't all hostile to the romans . 
  aberdeen in particular traded quite extensively with them . 
   the viking invasion in about 800ad almost completely ignored scotland for the majority of their conquests , content with simply raiding there . 
  also not actually true . 
  there was a brief period of time where they held most of mainland scotland after they killed the current king , but they were fairly swiftly removed by a pictish warlord , kenneth macalpin . 
  [ ** robert the bruce ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_i_of_scotland ) - best king scotland ever had as far as i 'm concerned , a genius tactician and guerrilla warfare fighter . 
  he consistently won battles where he was outnumbered and worse-equipped and reconquered the whole of scotland from the superior english army , which eventually culminated in the [ battle of bannockburn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_bannockburn ) in which the scots were outnumbered three-to-one , had nothing but spearmen and a small contingent of lightly-armoured horsemen , vs english infantry , longbow men and heavy cavalry . 
  his most legendary action took place just before the start of the battle . 
  to quote wikipedia 's description :  there now occurred one of the most memorable episodes in scottish history . 
  henry de bohun , nephew of the earl of hereford , was riding ahead of his companions when he caught sight of the scottish king riding at some distance away from his troops . 
  de bohun , no doubt hoping to win the day and personal glory by promptly dispatching bruce , lowered his lance and launched a fatal charge . 
  king robert , mounted on a small palfrey , was unarmoured and carrying only a battle-axe . 
  [ 22 ] as de bohun 's great war-horse thundered towards him , bruce stood his ground , all the while watched with mounting anxiety by his own army . 
  with the englishman only feet away , bruce turned his mount aside , avoided the lance , stood in his stirrups and smote the oncoming knight so hard and accurately with his axe that he split his adversary 's helmet and head asunder , killing him instantly . 
  this remarkable encounter became in a real sense a symbol of the imminent battle and of the war itself : the one side larger and heavily armed but lacking agility ; the other highly mobile and employing opportunistic tactics . 
  rebuked by his commanders for the enormous risk he had taken , the king only expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his axe . 
  hell , the first war of independence had a whole raft of scottish heroes that played a part in that war , almost all of them as equally skilled tacticians as the bruce : [ ** william wallace ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_wallace ) - not the tartan wearing , woad painted eejit that gibson portrayed him as ; he was the son of a nobleman and a knight . 
  won the battle of stirling bridge , utterly crushing the english forces there and winning the scots their first major victory of the war [ ** andrew de moray ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrew_de_moray ) - led an uprising in northern scotland and reclaimed it from the english , subsequently joined his forces with william wallace and was wallace 's fellow commander during the battle of stirling bridge , but was unfortunately mortally wounded and died soon after the battle . 
  [ ** `` the black douglas '' ( sir james douglas ) ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_douglas,_lord_of_douglas ) - son of william douglas , the first noble supporter of william wallace , who was confined to the tower of london and his lands seized and granted to an english lord . 
  the black douglas was sent to france to be educated during the early years of the war of independence , and there met william lamberton , the bishop of st. andrews and one of the masterminds behind the scottish resistance , who took the douglas to the court of edward i of england to try and reclaim his lands , but both had to flee when edward heard who 's son he was . 
  after this the douglas was landless and an outcast , but chose to cast his lot in with robert the bruce when he killed his main foe and made a bid for the crown . 
  he and bruce suffered several losses during this period which forced them into hiding , but contributed heavily towards their tendency to guerrilla tactics . 
  he remained in hiding until robert the bruce returned from exile . 
  when the bruce returned from exile , douglas focused his efforts on the south , staging several hit and run attacks and constantly avoiding any forces sent out to find them . 
  one of his more famous events was the capture of roxburgh fortress ; the scots had absolutely no siege equipment capable of taking these castles , so they resorted to other means :  in dealing with this problem the scots responded in the manner of foxes ; and among the more cunning of their exploits was douglas ' capture of the powerful fortress at roxburgh . 
  his tactic , though simple , was brilliantly effective . 
  on the night of 19/20 february 1314 -- shrove tuesday and ash wednesday -- several dark shapes were seen beneath the battlements and mistakenly assumed to be cattle . 
  douglas had ordered his men to cover themselves with their cloaks and crawl towards the castle on their hands and knees . 
  with most of the garrison celebrating just prior to the fast of lent , scaling hooks with rope ladders attached were thrown up the walls . 
  taken by complete surprise the defenders were overwhelmed in a short space of time . 
  roxburgh castle , among the best in the land , was slighted or destroyed in accordance with bruce 's policy of denying strongpoints to the enemy . 
  ** sorry about the massive wall of text , i have a bit of a fondness for history :| **, 
  without a doubt , the [ highland clearances ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highland_clearances ) , they were utterly despicable . 
  had a friend who lived in krakow for a few years , i visited occasionally , fairly nice city . 
  that 's a hilarious and ignorant misunderstanding of why ireland was in the state that it was . 
  the tl ; dr of the matter was that almost all of ireland 's heavy industry was in the north , which chose to remain with the uk , the rest of the country was agricultural and as such has to rebuild their industry from scratch , which coupled with terrible decisions by the politicians was a disaster . 
  english politicians however can still vote on laws in westminster that then over-rule anything holyrood does . 
  cameron 's latest crusade against internet porn for example . 
   it 's entirely accurate not even close . 
  for starters , the battle of stirling bridge was missing a bridge . 
   the rest of the uk would have no reason or obligation to allow scotland to continue to use the pound . 
  they would n't get a say on that . 
  there is literally nothing the uk could do to stop us using the sterling , osbourne admitted as much . 
  as to the schengen , despite the ukip circlejerk in the uk , i do n't think the eu is incompetent enough to try and impose an open border scheme on a country that has no land borders with countries using the schengen which would cause border controls with the country it does share a border with ; it goes against the point of the schengen entirely . 
  i counted scots , because it - is - a language as far as i 'm concerned and i 'm damned near fluent in it . 
  and about 20 % do n't know . 
  that 's a big ` if ' , especially since the campaigns for either side have n't really started yet . 
  no ; it 's a load of shit . 
  that time period would have made for some fantastic films . 
  but no . 
  we 're stuck with fucking braveheart , which my inner historian spits on . 
  yeah , certainly would have been a good idea . 
  it 's difficult to tell just how many people are scottish / other uk-citizens on here and places like like / r/unitedkingdom, 
  no , we wo n't . 
  the eu has a certain number of conditions that must be met before a country can join the euro , and these can be delayed indefinitely by countries ( see sweden , poland , czech republic , etc ) . 
  furthermore countries are not required to join the euro if it 'll damage their economy ; and it would almost certainly damage the scottish one . 
   i voted yes in the hope that such a country will join the euro wo n't happen , the euro has far too much negative press at the moment for it to even be considered an option . 
  same thing happens in scotland , our welfare state is doing just fine . 
   sometimes there are very good songs in languages other than english , which go completely under the radar . 
  let 's discover them !, 
  well , of the two non-english options in scotland , there 's gaelic and scots . 
  as far as gaelic goes , you do n't get better than runrig . 
  [ alba - runrig ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbj_bexv7po ) ( this is generally considered to be their most recognisable gaelic song , [ translation here if you want it ] ( http://lyrics.wikia.com/runrig:alba ) ) [ tir an airm - runrig ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3glotmd39u0 ) ( [ translation ] ( http://lyrics.wikia.com/runrig:tir_an_airm ) ) [ an toll dubh - runrig ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejs7hfpsl4a ) ( [ translation ] ( http://lyrics.wikia.com/runrig:an_toll_dubh ) ) as for scots stuff , you 've got a fair bit more .

  i will repeat it again . 
  geographical term . 
  if people want to call themselves british then they 're both accurate and well within their rights to do so . 
  a. geographical . 
  term . 
  i will repeat this until it bores until all your heads .
