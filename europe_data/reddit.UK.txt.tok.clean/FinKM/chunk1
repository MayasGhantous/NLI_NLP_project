welcome to britain . 
  that 's okay !, 
  in britain we use `` two birds with one stone '' , not flies . 
  you would have to be very good at throwing stones to hit a fly !, 
  birds . 
  two birds with one stone . 
  not flies . 
  either i 'm missing the joke , or we have differing definitions of the word kettle . 
  scotland are the sensible lefties that stop the conservatives getting a majority every election , i very much think they should stay . 
  i may dislike nigel farage and pretty much everything he stands for , but that would be absolutely brilliant to watch . 
  to be honest i am scripting the conversation already ...  hello this is bt technical support , how may i help ? 
   hi , could you unblock the porn for me please ? 
   pardon , sir ? 
   the porn , i want it unblocked . 
   ...  look , i 'm a student , this stuff is important . 
  how else am i meant to kill a few hours a day ? 
  i mean yeah the weird stuff is n't vital , but you guys blocked pornhub and ...  okay sir , i 'll get it back for you as soon as possible , now may i have your account name ? 
   and tblop , are you guys mad ? 
   sir , your account details please . 
  the semi-finals do n't have a sarcastic commentary mocking all the contestants , it 's boring without that !, 
  it starts off well , then descends very quickly once he starts talking about how america was the greatest and how it could be again . 
  no country that views itself that way is great . 
  i do n't think that specific kind of patriotism exists outside of the usa to be honest . 
  very cool , anyone know where to find more detailed information on how they actually work ? 
  i 'm in exeter in the uk , i am convinced this snow business has all been made up to annoy us . 
  a good discussion is one that forks out into new ideas . 
  this is n't about preconceived notions either way , i have very little interest in having a go at a particular country . 
  all i was trying to do was show people that hdi is n't the whole story . 
  also it is precisely the attitude of `` america is at the centre of everything '' that , perhaps rightly , gets it so scorned on this subreddit . 
  i did not mention the usa in my post , you assumed that . 
  not at all , the hdi is a basic measure of development , but to actually get a more accurate picture of the situation in a country you need to look at all sorts of different data sets . 
  you see here that while the usa is richer than most of europe , it is far less equal . 
  that is n't an anti-usa comment , it is an important fact . 
  another interesting one is the [ gini coefficient ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/gini_retouched_legend.gif ) , which ranks countries by income equality . 
  shows a very different picture . 
  we ... we are n't top of this ? 
  i 'm sure this data is interesting , but it would have been more suited to a bar graph ... or any other type of graph for that matter . 
  the main problem is that those without the fortunate gift of insight will just use this as an excuse to attack the muslim community at large . 
  it 's shame but it is entirely predictable . 
  ironic really , these two buffoons may think they are furthering islam but are in fact doing the exact opposite . 
  because this is the free comment section , the point is to provide a wide range of different views on subjects that individual journalists feel are pertinent . 
  the main body of the articles in the independent will conform to a more moderate viewpoint . 
  that said i actually think this article is fairly spot on . 
  lucky bastard , what did they play ? 
  really ? 
  because this seems very at odd with the innumerable pieces of [ consumer protection ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumer_rights/rights-contracts/directive/index_en.htm ) and [ workers rights ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=82&amp;langid=en ) bills that the eu has implemented . 
  in fact trade unions have almost unanimously backed staying in the eu for those exact reasons , plus to think the tory government post brexit would somehow be more pro-workers rights seems somewhat wrongheaded .

  status quo of the eu remaining together , but there are a lot of different directions after that . 
  what do you think their status quo is ? 
  is there anyone in the extensive list of experts , world leaders , and economic organisations that is n't a fear monger by your measure ? 
  at a certain point you must accept that when there is near unanimous consensus from so many quarters they may have a valid set of points . 
  do n't take it from me then , take it from the german minister of finance , wolfgang sch\u00e4uble , who said there will be [ no single market access for britain after brexit . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/10/no-single-market-access-for-uk-after-brexit-wolfgang-schauble-says ) the eu is far more capable of dealing with the lost trade than we are . 
  introducing tariffs with our single largest trading partner will be very damaging to our economy . 
  partially because of costs to british businesses doing trade with the eu , and partially because any multinational with common sense will simply up and move to a single market state . 
  while freedom of movement may not directly benefit you , it does allow business people and highly trained professionals to freely move around bringing trade and wealth with them . 
  getting rid of it would be awful for an academic institution or international corporation . 
  may i ask what your profession is that has been so badly impacted by eu migration ? 
  ( which i may add , is an economic contributor by every measure ) . 
  i 'm sure more will eventually join , but if we are in the eu we have oversight and a veto on that process . 
  we are part of the eu just as much as germany , just as much as france , and just as much as any other member state . 
  what is considerably more important than the possible ascension of other countries is the very real and tabulated risks to leaving . 
  i 'm personally more concerned with losing freedom of movement and access to the world 's largest single market than i am about another country possibly gaining it . 
  turkey has been in that process for 30 years and is currently slipping further away from acceptance . 
  maybe in another 30 years they will be closer , but they are not `` set to join the eu '' any time soon . 
  i 'm happy for boris the comic to keep appearing on panel shows and other places where he ca n't wield too much power . 
  the reality is that his mayorship has been full of expensive white elephants , khan will be a great improvement . 
  [ social democrat apparently ] ( http://www.politicaltest.net/test/graphic2/153796_eng.jpg ) although i would contest that i care a lot more about the environment than this graph shows . 
  no questions of green development . 
  i just got back from bilbao and the price of public transport is ridiculously cheap there . 
  you pick up a 10 euro card and that lasts for a couple of days travel on bus , metro , tram , train , transporter bridge etc. 
  cheaper than anything here . 
  i facepalm for my country . 
  he also took a train to a major international conference , and is actually something resembling left wing ... can we have him ? 
  well as i see it the 21st century is a make-or-break time for humanity . 
  we have so many serious problems that we need to solve as quickly as possible and the only way we are going to do that is by working together . 
  international politics is a melee at the best of times and as such is a major obstacle to creating the multilateral cooperation that we require to solve said problems . 
  i would argue that a european federation of sorts would allow europe as a whole to tackle these issues far more effectively . 
  a combined economy would do wonders for fiscal stability as well . 
  i imagine any move in this direction will be accompanied by a fairly radical overhaul in how eu voting works . 
  hopefully a proper eu parliament as the ultimate power as opposed to the current structure . 
  it does figure that most of the comments so far are from the other brits . 
  i for one hope this goes ahead , as long as the power is both ways , a restructuring of the european democratic process is necessary . 
  ... why did i just spend ten minutes looking at traffic signs ? 
  well as long as the entire thing is made a little more democratic than it currently is , i look forward to it . 
  please do n't leave , we need you to keep voting labour to get rid of the tories . 
  well it is an important part of american culture , eurovision on the other hand is universally considered to be a bit of a joke . 
  let 's not , europe has many cultural achievements but eurovision is not one of them . 
  as long as we let norway run it , no i do n't care about the practicalities of that . 
  i 'd rather not find out thanks . 
  can we just agree to let the scandinavians run everything ?
