  yes ffs mods tag this, 
  a subreddit made you dislike europe ? 
  you pillock ... 
  well if you 're not looking for an argument perhaps refrain yourself from calling whole swathes of people stupid . 
  no it did not . 
   data from adwords , which offers more specific numbers for search terms , shows that the 250 per cent increase in searches actually correlated to about 1,000 people asking the question . 
  [ ( the telegraph ) ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/06/27/were-brits-really-googling-what-is-the-eu-after-voting-to-leave/ ) one of the most searched things ? 
  not even close ... 
  you did n't refute a single point there , just saying people are stupid because they have a problem or that their problems do n't matter because not everyone shares that view is n't a very good argument . 
  i do n't think liberalism in the uk has anything to do with being pro or anti-monarchy though , it 's about as irrelevant to liberals here as liberals in america . 
  they do n't in the uk , that 'd be republicans . 
  fair enough . 
  for me the uk is my home , i 'm not nationalistic or evenly particularly patriotic but i do n't think there 's anywhere else i could live in the eu without getting homesick , thus the uk is my only true home . 
  i agree it has more direct effects on my life than nato etc though . 
  just still feels very distant . 
  i do n't to be honest , it 's just a supranational union to me like the un or nato or something . 
  now we 're leaving ... * shrugs * . 
  i hope both sides will be better off but i think it 'll be painful for us ( the uk ) . 
  do you believe everything you read ? 
  that story was beyond a joke . 
  we do it in our own ` historic cities ' so i do n't see why we would n't abroad . 
  edit : not saying we should though ofc, 
  yep . 
  ca n't wait to piss away a fiver . 
  the uk should probably take more , yes . 
  if i was in sweden or germany i 'd probably be saying the opposite though . 
  an eu wide policy will probably just piss off individual states though as different countries have differing views , nothing new there though . 
  also f it was up to me i think we should take refugees ( not economic migrants ) directly from areas of conflict rather than letting them trek across continents . 
  i hope not , 21 is a joke , there 'd be riots - though at least my local spoons ( pub ) would n't be full of 16 year olds . 
  binge drinking culture is still alive here , though it has come under more scrutiny as alcohol 's health effects become better understood and people are generally more health conscious . 
  anything to make it sound bigger , bless him . 
  cycle to a pub with a nice garden . 
  2037 years . 
  it became a roman city ( municipium ) in 50 ad but by about 500 ad romans had left and it became an anglo-saxon settlement . 
  from then on it 's just been a small market town until 1877 when it was given city status by queen victoria . 
  ops question was where would you live if you had to leave europe , but i 'm flattered nonetheless , 
  i think we all have different things in common with each other , however i think the uk often has more in common the anglo-sphere than some european countries , especially those further out to the east . 
  probably either new york , melbourne or toronto in that order . 
  they all seem like cities with lots going on , lots of young people , good job prospects and they all seem like they have good public transport ( i ca n't drive ) . 
  we 're only leaving the eu !, 
  at my school everyone had to do one language , usually french , then there was the option to do another too , usually spanish , german or italian . 
  latin and mandarin were ` extra-curricular ' subjects you could do during lunch or something . 
  i did french and german but i only really remember random bits of vocabulary . 
  i also did a french exchange but while there everyone replied to me in english so i basically just spoke in english the whole time . 
  i 'm a student and our floor is always covered in drink spills and food and just general rubbish so living here i do yeah , however at home or round regular people 's houses i always take them off . 
  slippers for the winter , socks in the summer - maybe even bare foot if it 's really hot out . 
  yeah sorry i see what you meant now , my bad, 
  oh yeah i misunderstood him haha , my bad, 
  the uk was part of the ` big 3 ' with france and germany so we were leading ? 
  nice way to oversimplify a complex issue into something it 's not . 
  ** it was n't an english empire this really bugs me ** . 
  why do people pretend scotland were n't complicit in the british empire ? 
  it was n't even predominantly english ( according to ` scotland and the british empire ' by john m. mackenzie and t.m. 
  no , english people believe we 're all british and every man or women 's vote is equal . 
  hence why when more british people decided we should leave then eu the uk government went through with it . 
  english exceptionalism is about as real as nessie . 
  he 's not scottish he has n't got a scooby . 
  plenty of scots care about england , wales and ni and vice versa . 
  because scotland voted to stay part of the uk only 3 years ago !, 
  in the uk we take decisions as a whole like any other sovereign state , bavarians in germany do n't get any special say , why should scots in the uk ? 
  we 're all one people ; british . 
  it 's only rural areas of england ukip have ever gained any footing , and considering their millionaire financier just left them i think ukip is actually over . 
  they were n't ignored though ? 
  everyone eligible got a vote . 
  the decision did n't go scotland 's way of course but that 's the nature of being a minority in a majority rule referendum . 
  i completely agree we need more proportional representation though , the last ge highlighted how much of a joke our system is . 
  well scotland got to vote to increase england 's tuition fees , whereas england had no say over scotland - it 's not the only case either . 
  though overall i agree with your sentiment , scotland along with the north of england , wales and ni are neglected . 
  everyone 's had their say . 
  together we voted and more people of the uk want the uk to leave the eu than to stay . 
  we 're one country . 
  the only alternative i can think of is all 4 nations get a veto , but that would mean scotland , a country of 5 million , or ni a country of 1.8 million or wales a country 3 million controlling the destiny of 65 million . 
  that 's hardly fair , every person should be equal regardless of nationality . 
  in the referendum every vote was equal and that 's fair . 
   i know it runs against everything your colonialist genes are telling you wtf ? 
  i 'm english , though i consider myself british . 
  honestly i think it 's really sad . 
  we 've been in a union since 1707 and it feels like a lot of scotland is more than happy to sack the rest of us off for the eu , which , though i voted remain , i hold no particular allegiance or loyalty to , i 'm honestly quite shocked scots do ( no offence ) . 
  on a more reasonable note , it 's obvious there 's a chasm dividing some aspects of politics north and south of the border . 
  i understand scotland keeps not voting for stuff and getting it anyway , but the alternative is scotland with a pop . 
  of 5 million having equal say to england with 55 million people - how 's that fair ? 
  i genuinely think independence would be bad for all 4 nations , though england being the strongest economically i would n't be too worried about . 
  right now centre left politics is pretty dead in england ( thx labour ) , but soon enough i 'm sure it 'll be back and scotland voting for it along with all the major cities like liverpool , manc , cardiff etc will mean the tides have turned against the tories . 
  what do you propose to make it fairer considering it 's a country smaller than london population-wise ? 
  they have their fair share of mps in westminster . 
  they even have their own devolved parliament ( england does n't ) , but england is a country of 55 million - scotland only 5 million . 
  if scotland had an equal say over something like brexit one scot would have the same influence as 10 englishmen , is that fair ? 
  from ages 5-15 all kids get taught ; + ** maths ** + ** english ** + ** science ** * history * geography * languages ( usually french ) * pe ( physical education ) * art and design * design and tech * computing * citizenship * music * also re ( religious education ) and pshe ( personal , social , health and economic education ) though i 'm not sure these are essential . 
  the first three have the most time spent on them however and are generally seen as most important , things like art , citizenship and music i remember as a bit of a doss , just an hour a week of pissing about . 
  at age 15-16 pupils do gcse 's , everyone must do a a gcse in maths , english literature , english language , biology , chemistry and physics . 
  the rest of the subjects you get to pick and choose what you 'd like to study and get examined on . 
  when you pick your gcse subjects there are often new options avalaible , for example i chose to do german and graphic design which were n't previously available . 
  it 's mainly a-levels ages 16-18 when students delve into more humanities like economics , politics , psychology and so on . 
  tldr : maths science and english are the most important , then maybe history , geography and foreign languages , then the rest is more if you enjoy it go for it . 
  it 's only later on in school a lot of social sciences become available .

  yeah , it gets used in the winter then in summer clothes usually get hanged up outside on the washing line, 
  maybe libertarian even though it seems like a wasted vote , i do n't really know an awful lot about the parties to be honest . 
  i 've never heard of it . 
  i could n't even estimate how much that 'd go for in the uk , you do n't exactly get many old-school american fire trucks over here .
