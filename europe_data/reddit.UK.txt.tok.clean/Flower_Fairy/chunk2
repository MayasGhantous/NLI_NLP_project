  that has never been the goal of any pride march : it 's in the name , pride . 
  it 's a way of showing that despite the prevailing view of society we 're not ashamed , to celebrate diversity and demonstrate our right to exist openly without persecution . 
  to be fair , there is a significant ethnic aspect to religion/religious groups . 
  see for example people still being considered jewish even if they are n't a believer of that faith . 
  it 's not like religion is purely about personal beliefs everywhere in the world or never has any overlap with race . 
  also , some people would probably say that islamophobia only exists because of the groups that make up the majority of its followers . 
  [ the wikipedia page on islamophobia is an interesting read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamophobia ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes see the section on `` future enlargement '' :  an internal gchq document from 2009 said that the `` germans were a little grumpy at not being invited to join the 9-eyes group . '', 
  i do n't know , i think your links agree with the person you replied to that things are getting rapidly worse ( in terms of human rights for gay people ) . 
  the opendemocracy article seems to be mostly arguing that there is not widespread support for the anti-gay laws . 
  it notes that `` reasonable , objective and positive information about homosexuality is hard to find '' and that `` this negative coverage also affects poll results : with no view of their own on the subject , respondents will tend to go for what they think is accepted opinion . '', 
  it 's a fair point that these opinions are probably in many cases not strongly held ( which is n't terribly surprising as there is no strong argument against gay rights ) , however i do n't think it addresses the point made in this thread by the op and the person you replied to that public attitude to gay people is getting worse . 
  a shift in what people perceive as the accepted opinion is not an insignificant change in this context . 
  can you explain why you feel that way ? 
  i do n't understand how the video is relevant . 
  why so aggressive and derisive ? 
  you 're just making yourself look like a jerk . 
  i hear a lot of bad stories of proselytising the vulnerable and pushing very regressive , damaging ideas . 
  it 's good to hear a different perspective , thank you . 
    i can not think of anything `` catholic '' that is n't bad . 
   i hope you 're trolling on this . 
  in case they 're not and other people generally agreed with them , what positive influences would you say catholicism has today ? 
  the one major thing i can think of is their pope pushing people to address climate change . 
  they have various charitable efforts , but i 'm not sure whether they actually do more good than harm . 
  just look at mother teresa . 
  edit : honest question btw , i would love to improve my opinion of the religion . 
  my experience of it in the past has been extremely negative , but it 's possible i just have n't been exposed to the positive things it does . 
  mr. putinbot ? 
  putin would not want a united eu . 
  they 're both trying to build models that account for all the available evidence . 
  i was n't talking specifically about gender studies , i was talking more generally about the social sciences . 
  you 've done the same strange thing as the person i was replying to of quoting an imaginary theory/argument , when i 'm pretty sure they 're based on a very flawed understanding of the concepts being mentioned ( not that i have any understanding of them either ) . 
  if various actual theories could be as easily shown to be flawed as you say without even needing to study the topics , surely one of the many people studying these things for most of their life would do so ? 
  why do n't any of the people who feel it 's that simple publish a paper and revolutionise scientific understanding of these topics ? 
  this is like saying you do n't take physicists seriously since they started talking about quantum mechanics . 
  i could stereotype them as overweight crazy nerds , it would just as unfair and irrelevant . 
  what at first seems instantly obvious and is widely accepted as `` common sense '' is n't necessarily what 's true . 
  just because a concept seems complex , unintuitive or unlikely does n't mean you should dismiss it . 
  you 're talking about people who 've spent a long time trying different ideas and working to figure these things out , they 're going to have a better understanding than we can get by guessing as laypeople . 
  [ tim minchin - the pope song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtiorwtjbhe ), 
   full equal rights to lgbt people well , i do n't know about that . 
  marriage equality is a step in the right direction for lgb and makes life easier for the t , but it 's not everything by a long shot . 
   ttip is n't even public yet and - and it 's already having negative effects on consumers and public for the sake of large corporations . 
  or did n't you read the submission ? 
   legislation planned for 2014 was kicked back until at least 2016 , despite estimated health costs of $ 150bn per year in europe from endocrine-related illnesses such as iq loss , obesity and cryptorchidism -- a condition affecting the genitals of baby boys . 
  that 's the concept i 'm criticising , what do you mean when you say clinically insane ? 
  that makes more sense than what i was thinking , just wanted to check . 
  insane ? 
  what do you actually mean ? 
  since [ 1 in 4 people ] ( http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/statistics-and-facts-about-mental-health/how-common-are-mental-health-problems/ ) ( in the uk ) will experience a mental health problem each year it seems like you might be disenfranchising quite a large portion of the population . 
  for another statistic , [ 19 % of people in the us ] ( http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-mental-illness-ami-among-adults.shtml ) were suffering from a mental illness in 2012 . 
  even if it was n't so many people , why do n't you think someone should be allowed to vote if they have for example ocd ( probably one of the most obviously `` insane '' disorders ), 
   it was with the consent of the german government . 
  i think you could 've ended that comment there : /, 
  well , communication over text has its flaws . 
  misunderstandings are going to happen unfortunately . 
  we can probably put at least part of it down to that . 
  i 'm pretty sure all the comments along those lines in this thread are very tongue-in-cheek . 
  a recent survey around easter with a sample of 1,906 found that 62 % of people here do not consider themselves religious . 
  of people aged 18-24 almost 3/4 said religion was n't important to their lives . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/2015/easter-religion-and-other-news/ ), 
   i do n't understand why they 're so obsessed with immigrants . 
  this gets me too . 
  i sometimes wish it was possible to do some sort of bargaining as simple as `` we 'll let you implement your policies on immigration if you let us do ours on climate change/social equality/reducing state surveillance/whatever '' . 
  it 's seen as such a disproportionately big deal that i feel like the leverage would let you do all sorts of good , more than enough to make up for the anti-immigration stuff . 
  it 's probably a very naive and silly idea , but it makes me wonder . 
  the wikipedia articles on [ individualism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/individualism ) and [ collectivism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collectivism ) are good reads , especially taken in context of the linked articles . 
  i 'd recommend the `` see also `` s , particularly for collectivism ; the article for individualism goes into greater depth . 
  this bit in particular seems relevant to your comment :  individualism which encourages individuality at the expense of others can not be considered collectivist , nor even individualist , since individualism is not the same as [ egotism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egotism ) . 
  this is a public forum , but i see your point . 
  if shame is the issue you 're concerned about then that would n't apply somewhere anonymous . 
  still , i do n't think it 's fair to tell them that they need to use the flag as the symbol of their country when they just did exactly that . 
  it 's literally right next to their name in every comment they 've made , ca n't you see user flair on mobile or something ? 
  i 've never personally said anything about this person , i do n't even know ( or care ) who she is . 
  however , if there was ever a genocide specifically targeting white men , carried out by the country bahar mustafa lived in , which later created a law forbidding people from denying that it did so , which she broke as part of continued incitement against what is clearly in this universe a persecuted social group - then it would be comparable . 
  in that scenario , i think most people who sympathise with germany 's law would also want to see her sent to jail for her speech . 
  i do n't understand how you can reach that conclusion . 
  you can see from my link that thousands have died on the crossing . 
  why would they leave everything in their lives behind and take such a terrible risk unless they had no other choice ? 
  i 'm sure there are a few exceptions , there always are , but in the vast majority of cases these people are coming here because they have nowhere else to go . 
  there are [ 2,000,000 registered refugees in turkey ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=224 ) , over [ 1,000,000 in lebanon ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122 ) , and [ 600,000 in jordan ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=107 ) . 
  the refugees we are receiving from syria can not be explained away even in part as just people who somehow bought a passport , this is a genuine crisis which is forcing millions of people out of their homes and home country . 
  those are n't the places these people are coming from though , with the exception of afghanistan which i though did qualify for refugee status . 
  [ they 're still being attacked by the taliban and islamic state ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11371138 ) . 
  even if they do n't , [ more than half are from syria ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php ) . 
  if something that claims to be the left stops fighting for social change for persecuted minorities , it 's not the left any more . 
  i do n't think the kind of group you 're talking about is the radical left though , take a look at a subreddit of the actual radical left like / r/anarchism for example . 
  i do n't agree with their conclusions , but i think they have some pretty good discussion and valid criticism of aspects of society . 
  at very least , they 're capable of arguing a point rather than just trying to speak over people . 
  i agree that what you 're describing is a worrying trend , but i think it 's more of a wider problem with the internet . 
  trends towards communicating through mediums like twitter and in echo-chambers like tumblr ( and to an extent reddit ) kill nuance and debate . 
  this conversation we 're having now is an example of an exception to all this though . 
  i 'm transgender myself , if you did n't already guess , and i hope you have n't got the impression that i 'd discount anyone 's opinion or try to shut them up based on their sex or whatever . 
  i 'd like to hope that now you 've had at least one discussion where a trans person used cisgender in a meaningful way . 
  i dislike all the labelling too , i wish we could all just be people . 
  the lgbt movement is still very young though , despite coming an incredibly long way so very quickly . 
  in places where it has come furthest , where being gay is n't seen as at all unusual or surprising , i think people are starting to move away from the need to define or label and are able to just be themselves , to be people . 
  `` coming out '' becomes no longer necessary . 
  i hope eventually everything can go that way , but it seems one of the best way to break stigma and reach that point is through labelling and defining terms in ways that reframe concepts . 
  after all , that is what we were doing at the start of this conversation with pedophilia .
