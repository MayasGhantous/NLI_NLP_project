i 'm torn between the two . 
  two of my cousins work in the square mile . 
  i spoke to them for the first time since the referendum , and they are both of the opinion that ` brexit ' will not materialise . 
  considering the current climate , i was quite taken aback by how confident and relatively unperturbed they appeared . 
  i do n't share their optimism , but i am not a particularly intelligent person . 
   the press association is reporting the men killed are believed to be spanish nationals , originally from gambia . 
  confirmed . 
  this was a hate crime . 
  i 've gotten to the stage where i expect one whenever i open a link . 
  do the ports of caen , cherbourg , roscoff , st. malo etc. 
  have similar ( albeit less pronounced ) problems to those faced by calais ? 
  i never hear of them . 
  i do n't live ever so far away from a very large haulage company , and i believe i 'm right in saying that they 've dropped calais almost entirely , now using the port of rotterdam as their main port of entry in to europe . 
  seeing as most of their trade is with france/italy/spain , it seems odd to me that they 'd opt for a north sea port . 
  i can not ask this question without sounding like an arsehole , but what makes you feel more european than irish ? 
  if any clarification is needed , i 'm ` pro-eu ' and feel european , but at the same time i feel far more english than european . 
  different rather than special . 
  superior ? 
  certainly not . 
  come and have a go if you think you 're hard enough !, 
  j/k always a pleasure to see wales win !, 
  i 'd pay good money to see them go all the way . 
  i did n't know we still had beef ? 
  i 'm qualified to answer this !, 
  i voted to remain , though live in one of the ' ** top 3 ** ' leave strongholds . 
  ** crime : - ** i live in the absolute middle of nowhere . 
  the village i live in is surrounded by mile after mile of cabbage/cauliflower/potato fields . 
  prior to the ` great eastern expansion ' , criminal behaviour was extremely uncommon . 
  why ? 
  firstly , there was barely anything around here worth stealing , unless you felt like draining a farmer 's red diesel supply . 
  secondly , the population was too elderly and conservative to act violently and anti-socially , and owing to the demographics of the village , there was practically no demand for illegal drugs . 
  finally , there was no excessive drinking . 
  if you wanted to drink , you either had visit the pub , or drive 20 minutes to the supermarket . 
  there were no off-licences . 
  who migrated here ? 
  young men from countries like latvia , lithuania and poland . 
  what do young men want to do ? 
  drink and take drugs . 
  what happens when young men drink excessively and take drugs ? 
  they behave inappropriately . 
  drunkenness , loud behaviour and violence became quite commonplace . 
  owing to the numbers of men who came over in such a short space of time , they did n't need to integrate , which only furthered mistrust . 
  ** jobs : - ** did the poles * really * take ` our ' jobs ? 
  debatable . 
  around here , if you performed poorly at school , there was always a job waiting for you in the fields . 
  they were n't good jobs , but you had guaranteed employment . 
  farmers then began employing poles , which meant that those who left school with poor qualifications were expected to now compete for a job . 
  a 16 y/o with 1 gcse who lived at home with his parents became a less attractive potential employee than a pole . 
  why ? 
  the poles were a little older and had more work experience , and they also needed a roof over their head . 
  you can pay a polish guy # 300 a week , and them ask for # 200 of that back at the end of the month if you let him stay on your premises . 
  you do n't get that money back if the english lad already has a home . 
  the rural areas of england attract the poorly educated ( and often less well behaved ) immigrants , whilst the urban areas attract the skilled immigrants . 
  in the cities the poles are thought of as hard working , smart , polite people . 
  here , they 're seen as violent and drunk . 
  i have to say , i can see why people in the rural parts wanted to leave . 
  i think eu membership has been extremely beneficial for the uk , but the negative aspects of membership are amplified in the rural areas . 
  difficult to tell , but to me it looks as though farage is watching juncker suck on a large german variety of peanut . 
  terrible accident !, 
  what the hell was david hasselhoff thinking ? 
  there should also be diagonal blue/white hatching where scotland is located . 
  well , i suppose we 'll have less loose change , too . 
  shame referendums do n't work the same way . 
  one woefully embarrassing , the other , woefully embarrassing . 
  i 've been engaging in a lot of hopeful thinking myself over the past few days . 
  this monumental cock-up still has n't sunk in fully . 
  at this point , i 'd walk a thousand miles over broken glass to remain in the eea . 
  we 'd be able to keep many of the benefits , it 'd piss off the xenophobes ( not suggesting all brexiters are xenophobes , just a minority ) and it 'd make the eventual re-entry into the eu a lot easier . 
  i doubt very many mps would have the balls to return to their constituencies and say something along the lines of `` well , you opted to leave the eu , but i do n't think you really thought it through , so for that reason i 'm blocking the exit '' . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'd absolutely love for them to do that , but the potential for any such move is extremely minimal . 
  we 're out , i 'm angry . 
   england has really shit the bed . 
  the elderly are certainly incontinent . 
  i despise having the inevitable job of cleaning the sheets . 
  exactly . 
  when the economy tanks , are the salaries going to appeal to them ? 
  can somebody please shoot me ? 
   it still blows my mind to think that even 100 years later the marks from ww1 are still there . 
  i live about a 30 minute drive from a nature reserve which features a landmark ( well ... if you class a pond as a landmark ) named bean 's hole . 
  during a ww1 training exercise , a munitions truck driven by a guy presumably named bean slipped down an embankment , blowing a bloody massive crater in the middle of nowhere . 
  if you think you 're having a bad day , spare a thought for poor ol' bean . 
  thanks , i watched that video yesterday and left this short [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pq4ot/in_barnsley_70_of_the_population_voted_to_leave/d4ng9co ) . 
  i went down to the pub with my dad at lunchtime and overheard two guys in their mid/late seventies who were cheerfully talking about how things were going to return to the way they were `` in the old days '' . 
  that made me want to whack them both around their heads with a cricket bat . 
  they were living in world that not even my parents were born into . 
  they also discussed the issue regarding gibraltar 's border with spain , and one of them said that the spanish would n't be so `` ballsy '' if we had n't scrapped the vulcan . 
  i despair . 
  as of 18:25 gmt +1 { `` name '' : `` united kingdom '' , `` code '' : `` gb '' , `` signature_count '' :3225544 } it would indeed appear that the petition is now being moderated , as can be seen below . 
  * { `` name '' : `` north korea '' , `` code '' : `` kp '' , `` signature_count '' :27 } * { `` name '' : `` south georgia and the south sandwich islands '' , `` code '' : `` gs '' , `` signature_count '' :1 } * { `` name '' : `` vatican city '' , `` code '' : `` va '' , `` signature_count '' :47 }, 
  `` i ` ate the eu ` cus of the muslims wot come ` ere '' ~ * a small but sizable proportion of brexit voters . 
  most of those who voted to leave obviously are n't conspiracy theorists , though i 'd be lying if i said i had n't seen my fair share of ` pro-brexit ' comments mentioning the bilderberg group and the so-called ` new world order ' . 
  i guess the crazies were whipped up by the populism . 
  scotland would become both the least and most popular nation in the union overnight . 
  i 'll start practicing ' o flower of scotland ' and overstate my tenuous ancestral links to your nation like i was born on the other side of the atlantic . 
   how far into your arse did you have too reach to find that about half a fathom by the sound of things . 
   to me it 's very surprising , i expected a solid remain lead . 
  i believe this expectation was shared by many , so large numbers of people thought it would be safe to cast a protest vote . 
  i 'm 23 y/o , and whilst the overriding majority of my similarly aged friends and acquaintances voted to remain , some did vote to leave , and at least half of them have already expressed their regret for doing so . 
  i also work with a couple of guys in their late 20s who , despite having a generally ` pro-eu ' outlook , voted to leave in the expectation that a remain vote was an inevitability , but a large leave vote would give us extra room for maneuver in any future negotiations . 
  both had stated their regret by 08:00 on the friday morning .
