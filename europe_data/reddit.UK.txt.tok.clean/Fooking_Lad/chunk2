  if corbyn does win and a split does happen i would wager that owen smith will be the leader of the new party . 
  while some will go to the conservatives some will also go to ukip . 
  labour got the brexit vote horribly wrong and showed how out of touch they really are with their voters and as their popularity in the voting polls increase and labour popularity decreases . 
  i doubt ukip will get the same kind of popularity as the conservatives but they could replace labour as the second most popular party . 
  while ukip is more right wing i feel if the conservatives do n't get a majority in the election they could enter a coalition with each other . 
  we would only leave nato if america did which is very unlikely . 
  corbyn has not got a chance in being the pm . 
  if corbyn ends up winning the leadership vote there is a chance the party will split into corbyn labour and a labour more inline with the torys and neither will be popular enough to win an election . 
  if labour does not split then their voters will be stolen by ukip instead . 
  if labour keeps this fool in i can see ukip taking up more votes leading to 2020 . 
  ukip are already holding on despite the entire purpose of their party being accomplished . 
  labour is getting more and more out of touch from it 's original voter base each day . 
  eventually a new party will take it 's place and since ukip is the third most popular in england it is becoming more likely . 
  this idiot is the main reason i will always vote for the conservatives while he is still leader of the labour party . 
  they would probably think canada is communist . 
  it does seem to have an annoying thing to have in political discussions . 
  i doubt they would ever move and if they did i think their delusions of canada being a utopia would fade very quickly . 
  well i had very little to go on but your flair indicates you are canadian and it seems to be a trait i see from some canadians . 
  i still feel the idea of combining our olympic teams is silly , britain does more than well for itself and i doubt the average european would support the idea . 
   especially since we are so culturally similar that we often ca n't tell each other apart . 
  then again , that would explain the need to differentiate so desperately . 
  also , the us pretty much pays no attention to canada ( as far as media coverage , etc. , ) and i think that irks them . 
  i think you hit the nail on the head there , in terms of the north american continent everyone has their eyes on you as you are the more influential and stronger country and canada which is so incredibly similar just gets pushed to the side which obviously angers them . 
   h , everyone uses us as a punching bag to make themselves feel better . 
  i see it on / r/unitedkingdom like crazy . 
  especially with regards to the nhs . 
  i get it , our system sucks , but there are continental nations that have very successful insurance based systems that you could make a useful comparison to . 
  haha do n't worry that subreddit irks me too , it used to be quite decent but took a hard turn to the left and the whole brexit issue seems to have them in a very odd state of mind . 
  in terms of your healthcare system i think most people compare us because we are both english speaking nations and we seem like a better comparison but i do agree that some of the continentals have better systems than even we do despite that ours is quite decent . 
   as for trump , he 's an embarrassment , and i do n't blame people for mocking him . 
  the silver lining to me is that many republicans have come out against him , and it shows that there are still people who put the country before their party . 
  he is but i watched a political debate that was being held in canada which was about the refuge crisis and talking about what the us and canada should do , a woman campaigning to allowing refugees does n't even seem to hesitate about americans will swarm to canada if trump is elected . 
  it just felt like a quick cheap shot to make that was simply not needed . 
  i agree , i like canada but the mindset of some of them is incredibly silly that they do n't want to be associated with their closest neighbour . 
   hopefully it 's just an online thing , or a noisy minority . 
  maybe but i see a lot of the liberal canadians use the us as a punching bag or make snide jabs to make themselves look better , this is only getting bigger with donald trump . 
   maybe he is one of those special canadians that want to differentiate themselves from the us so hard actually i see this a lot , it seems a good majority of canadians nationality identity is simply not being american , it 's very bizarre . 
   so hard that they want to be in the eu . 
  i think it is so they can distance themselves from the us . 
  that 's their decision though , they are more than welcome to remove her . 
  i still do n't see how canadians would be a part of an eu olympic team , i do n't even want my country to be a part of it even if we voted remain , it 's a stupid idea . 
   i made something to remind ** us ** all that when ** we ** combine ** our ** efforts . 
  your flair indicates you are canadian , what is this `` us '' , `` we '' and `` our '' ? 
  i have very little confidence in it passing but it would at least show the nationalists it is not wanted at this time . 
  i know that but it 's incorrect that being in the eu also matters to scotland . 
  whether being in the uk or being in the eu matters more to scotland will be known soon enough . 
   `` dublin is only ranked 39 in the global financial centre ranking , which measures financial flows , the number of banks and other financial indicators , and it has also deficits in international accessibility , at least compared to frankfurt and paris , '' the report said . 
  well it would soon climb those rankings if it gained some of london . 
   dublin has less office space and higher commercial rents than frankfurt , making it a less attractive option for business looking to relocate from post-referendum london , a german think-tank has claimed . 
  property does seem to be a bit of an issue but hopefully the irish government can try and sort this out . 
  what this think tank probably forgot is that dublin and london are far similar than london and frankfurt , both dublin and london are english speaking cities which are both based in common law countries . 
  also both britain and ireland are culturally similar and their british workers can freely move to dublin because of the common travel area which could make setting up a little easier . 
  her own fault , no sympathy . 
  no , it was said if scotland left the uk it would also leave the eu . 
  even david cameron said it would need to join the queue to apply . 
  because staying in the uk meant staying in the eu . 
  that is no longer true though . 
  i agree but the scottish voted very differently compared to the rest of britain . 
  that still does n't change that eu citizens can enter ni which is part of the uk and will be non-eu territory with no checks . 
  it 's a fucking mess . 
  just like countries leave the eu all the time right ? 
  stormont would need to persuade westminster just like holyrood does . 
  the difference is the good friday agreement is a document based on the idea of a united ireland happening if there was a call for it . 
  if the nationalists can prove that the majority of the northern irish want it then westminster has to acknowledge it . 
  stormont ( northern ireland 's assembly ) would need permission from westminster for a referendum . 
  the roi government would then need to agree to northern ireland and the roi unifying . 
  there has been significant change since 2014 . 
  oh please the people who vote for the snp knew that another referendum could happen if the uk voted to leave . 
  you need to accept that just because yougov does a poll the issue is not addressed . 
  sturgeon is out there trying to look for a way for scotland to remain in the eu and if she feels independence is the way she will try for it . 
  who voted for the snp ? 
  i did but look at the last bit :  such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will . 
  scotland clearly voted to remain did n't they ? 
  read this then :  will there be another independence referendum ? 
   we believe that independence offers the best future for scotland . 
  however , scotland will only become independent when a majority of people in scotland choose that future in a democratic referendum -- it will not happen just because the snp wants it to , or because there is an snp government . 
   at the same time if there is a clear demand for a referendum no politician has the right to stand in the way of the people of scotland to choose their own future . 
   we believe that the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the scottish people -- or if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014 , such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will . 
   why not do yearly referendums , eh ? 
  lets make it part of new year celebrations or something . 
  i do n't like the referendums either but people knew this could be an issue if we voted to leave , i 'm not scottish and i do n't want the uk to break up but these issues have to be addressed . 
  yes but how can we not have a border between ni and the roi if one is in the eu and one is n't ? 
  if i was an eu citizen and i decided to travel to ireland for my holiday i can simply enter non-eu territory . 
  do you have any ideas how this can be resolved ? 
  so because yougov does a poll that means it 's addressed does it ? 
  well all of scotland 's counties and islands voted a majority of remain so we will have to see . 
  scotland does n't feels that way though . 
  stormont and westminster would both need to agree on it . 
  yes the unionists would attempt to but leaving the eu is big for ni and would affect them more than scotland . 
  i have my doubts if it would even win for ni to reunify but there needs to be clarity on the issue . 
  there needs to be a referendum on unification . 
  northern ireland just like most of the uk is divided on the vote to leave and if scotland deserves another referendum for independence then ni deserve a referendum on unification . 
  thanks , i must admit those pictures do n't look good at all and i hope this goes further . 
  it is sad that they would do this kind of thing and it 's sad for romania as it gets so much shit it simply does n't deserve . 
  nationalists still do it . 
  [ here is one of their fine pieces of work . 
  ] ( http://www.ohio-forum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/burke_derry4-.jpg ), 
  exactly , the past should never be forgotten but we should look to the future to work for a better life on both sides of ireland and between the uk and ireland . 
  because this is about serbia , not belgium . 
  if they do and it shows it was staged then i hope legal action is taken against them .
