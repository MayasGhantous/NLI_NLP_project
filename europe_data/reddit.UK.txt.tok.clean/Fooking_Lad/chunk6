  other countries like sweden keep trying to avoid it . 
   butwhy.gif i do n't know , for some reason the eu deem it important since they want everyone to consider themselves european . 
  not german , french , british etc. 
   thanks for being honest though . 
  no problem . 
  i doubt the uk will if it includes the freedom of movement of people . 
   why do you think you ca n't remove freedom of movement ? 
  got any economic reason why the whole thing would collapse without freedom of movement ? 
  seems like the only thing that would happen is you take away one attribute from you common market . 
  i doubt there is an economic reason . 
  the reason is to make european countries into one , including the people . 
  the purpose of the single market is to make all european markets one , this also means all citizens of european countries as one too . 
  that is the purpose of an ever closer union . 
   does it only apply only to workers or to any eu citizen ? 
   one of the four freedoms enjoyed by ** eu citizens ** read the definition . 
   and what counts as a worker ? 
  someone who works ? 
  there are some eu citizens who move countries and do n't work but the majority do . 
  what ? 
  you know what the freedom of movement for workers is . 
  in case for some reason you do n't the definition is :  one of the four freedoms enjoyed by eu citizens is the free movement of workers . 
  this includes the rights of movement and residence for workers , the rights of entry and residence for family members , and the right to work in another member state and be treated on an equal footing with nationals of that member state . 
  restrictions apply in some countries for citizens of member states that have recently acceded to the eu . 
  the rules on access to social benefits are currently shaped primarily by the case law of the court of justice .

  i really do n't understand why people think that they can choose one part of the single market and not the other . 
  the freedom of movement is ** a part ** of the single market . 
  the definition of the single market is a single market that seeks to guarantee the ** free movement of goods , capital , services , and people . 
  ** to destroy one of the four freedoms of the single market is to destroy the single market itself . 
  i do n't know how others interpret this but to me the eu seem to be consistent for a reason . 
  eu negotiations with scotland can not take place until scotland is an independent state . 
  sturgeon knows this and so do the eu but sturgeon needs to show the scottish people that if they wish to remain in the eu they need independence and to do this she is trying to look like she is trying every option there is to make the biggest case she can for indyref2 . 
  a lot of leave voters will see this as eu saying no but it 's not . 
  sturgeon is getting exactly what she wants by getting all these confirmations that a scotland in the uk means no eu membership for scotland and the eu ca n't be seen as trying to divide the uk . 
  sturgeon is playing well and showing herself to be a good leader and putting scotland 's interests first . 
  give it all to ireland , great bunch of lads . 
  i agree , it hurts to see so much disdain for the eu when it has been so overwhelmingly positive for the uk . 
  i vote dublin . 
  good . 
  this was a referendum , not a neverendum . 
  maybe if all the young people who signed that petition got off their arse and went to a polling station remain might have won . 
  no more referendums . 
  the british people have decided , that 's it , its over . 
  do n't want to loose your eu citizen rights ? 
  move country like i am . 
  this is pointless . 
  the majority of the british public voted to leave and as hard as it is to accept that has to be respected and carried out . 
  i hate the fact we have left the eu and will do what i need to get back in it but shouting for another referendum is stupid . 
  i 'm talking about english voters who have a claim to irish citizenship . 
  the hypocrisy is ridiculous , they want the benefits but do n't want to give it to non-brits . 
  a lot of the older generation who retired to countries like spain said they want to leave because of immigration . 
  bunch of bastards . 
  that 's my first option and hopefully a referendum happens . 
  yes but there is growing support for irish unification which would make the good friday agreement void . 
  hopefully i can move before this happens though . 
  exactly , want to know the even more annoying part ? 
  most of them probably voted to leave too . 
  they got to keep their eu citizenship while people like me got fucking shafted and i have no claim as all my family is english . 
  i would gladly give up my british citizenship for an eu one . 
  in fact ireland should quickly change these laws by either stopping them from claiming it or increasing the cost to a few thousand so the irish can make a sweet profit . 
  i have no irish family . 
  all i can hope is the negotiations last longer than 2 years . 
   i hope you can get irish or future scottish citizenship , i have no irish family so i 'll have to earn that one  , i am heavily looking at scotland though and i hope they get another referendum . 
   see you in the eu  , 
   i think most of us share your sentiment on that one . 
  for me the union has just lost a country i really like but gb voted against so many measures that i really think maybe its better for the eu that they left . . unless the exit will prove to be beneficiary to gb . 
  i agree . 
   i am so conflicted about it but i really hope gb does not do well and the eu can federalize in the next 50 years . 
  i 'm done with england , i 'm not staying in a country where my rights are torn up in front of me . 
  i hope a federal europe happens one day and i hope that i 'm a citizen of that federation . 
   i really have nothing against british citizens but i dont want other countries to leave the eu as well :( this is n't a british issue anymore . 
  it is an england & wales vs. scotland and northern ireland issue . 
  great britain will never be the same again and i do n't blame scotland or northern ireland for leaving . 
  i can see why some people were opposed to the eu but i loved it . 
  the feeling of being apart of something bigger and not being restricted to this island . 
  i am proud to call myself european and i feel my rights as an eu citizen are being taken away just like scotland 's is and it makes me angry . 
  angry , i voted remain . 
  the younger generation is fucked and i have 2 years to leave this island . 
  to be honest there is a big difference in leaving a country because you dislike the new leader of the country and moving country because you loose your rights as an eu citizen . 
  it 's saddening to be honest . 
  even if we do remain i 'm probably going to still move . 
  this is n't the end of brexit and when the eu want to create something big such as an eu military it will trigger another referendum . 
  exactly , the benefits we gain being in the single market are massive . 
  the funniest bit is although we may contribute a bit it pales to germany 's contribution . 
   thanks !, 
  i 'm certainly not an expert on this matter but sap are based in walldorf which happens to be in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg actually . 
  excellent , i will research some more . 
   plus , if you 're into football you could attend 1899 hoffenheim 's game whose manager is the next thomas tuchel , 28 year old julian nagelsmann . 
  i 'm not much of a football fan but it sounds fun . 
   germany ah , germany !, 
   baden-w\u00fcrttemberg bloody hell that looks lovely . 
   there are some really nice cities you could live in , like heidelberg , freiburg , konstanz or stuttgart , but i would n't be disappointed if you 'd go for berlin which you guys seem to love . 
  do you know what city is best for the it industry ? 
  cheers mate , where are you from ? 
  you should get a flair !, 
  if it gets me an eu passport i 'll do it . 
  exactly , i have tried to explain how big the eu trading bloc is compared to britain but some people live in the past and think the empire is still around . 
  it 's so frustrating trying to explain that britain is not what it once was . 
  i swear to fucking god i have heard this so many times by people who are voting out it makes me scream internally . 
  the worst of it is when you correct them with real sources and they say they are still voting out and when you ask them why they ** still ** believe we spend too much .
