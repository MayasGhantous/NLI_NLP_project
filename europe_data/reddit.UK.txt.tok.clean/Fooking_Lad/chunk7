   can you give some examples on how germany is `` clearly '' trying to take over europe in your opinion ? 
  did n't you hear ? 
  apparently those bloody huns have turned the eu into the 4th reich !, 
   young pro-eu generation of brits will suffer due to the choices of people that wo n't be around in the short to mid term future to feel the consequences . 
  exactly , there is no way i will stay in britain if we leave and as someone who values being a citizen of the eu i will be looking to ireland and the continent if we do . 
  good show !, 
  thanks for the links , i will read these . 
  i see , that seems fair . 
  i 'm not disputing whether it was a main reason or not , i am simply saying that there was other reasons . 
  [ here is an article that talks about it ] ( http://www.faithineurope.org.uk/lisbon.pdf )  from the start libertas highlighted its two arguments for rejecting lisbon that would dominate the agenda of the entire debate . 
   its first argument was that passing lisbon would force ireland to abandon its low tax policy and hence the many multinational companies that have bases in ireland to avail themselves of the low taxes would leave , taking hundreds of thousands of jobs with them . 
  the success of this campaign is evidenced by the belief of 43 per cent of voters that lisbon meant the loss of ireland 's low corporate tax rate ( 12.5 per cent ) , despite the assurances of all of the country 's main business groups that it did not . 
   the second libertas argument was that the proposed reduction in size of the eu commission would lead to the loss of irish influence in the eu , to the benefit of big states over the small states , an example of what the group believed was lisbon 's role in the ` relentless erosion of irish national sovereignty by an unelected and unaccountable brussels bureaucracy ' . 
  really ? 
  do you have a link to the comment ? 
   militarily-aid other eu members does that mean all military-aid such as medical aid and resources too ? 
  while neutrality was a concern there was other reasons for rejecting the treaty too . 
   yes , i know we are not technically neutral but we are recognised globally as such . 
  that comment was in a thread explaining why we could work with other nations militaries . 
  i know you are considered globally to be neutral and i believe ireland 's stance is a good one . 
   also touche  , 
   ireland ireland is not a neutral country and has n't claimed to be since the cold war ( ireland would not join nato because of british ruled ni ) . 
  there is nothing in the irish constitution does it say it is neutral . 
  it 's just been a government policy of non belligerence since wwii . 
  i must admit i did n't know austria was neutral , til . 
  i guess the eu must be unpopular for other reasons . 
  would n't switzerland officially joining the eu break their neutrality ? 
  two twats on the thames . 
  this is n't just about school breaks though here are some quotes from the article :  some [ students ] wanted to establish a prayer room on school property and the muslims ' prayers have become far more visible because in some cases and they have used the hallways to pray . 
  religion and education do n't belong together -- it belongs to the private life . 
  why should a school accommodate to their religion and give them a room to pray ? 
  they should be focusing on their work . 
   `` we 've been asked why they ca n't pray at ** specific times ** because there are some islamic directions that one should pray at specific times and it is unfortunate because it just adds more fuel to the fire on islamism . '' what specific times are these ? 
  what if they need to leave a class early to pray ? 
  they will not only be interrupting the class to leave but this will mean they will miss learning stuff which will put them at a disadvantage and what should the school do ? 
  create extra lessons for them to catch up ? 
  this will cost the school more money and waste the teachers time . 
   i feel the is the core of the problem with some immigrants ( not all of course ) . 
  britain and france for example have had immigrants coming for a while now . 
  it used to be simple : someone from x country would come , of course this person would retain aspect of her culture , and some of it would even be accepted by locals ( like food or art ) and become part of the local culture . 
  she would adapt and respect the local culture though , because she knew she was n't from there . 
  this person then would have kids , and these kids would receive some of the culture of their parents . 
  but , they would also become fully local , speaking the language and having the mentality of a local . 
  then these kids would have kids as well , and after a couple generation all them would feel 100 % british or french ( as many do ) . 
  i agree and this is how multiculturalism should work . 
   now , we see people claiming the local culture `` sucks '' , they do n't respect it at all and publicly state they want to force theirs ( which often is n't even theirs , but what they think their ancestors used to do ) on locals . 
  how is it not a recipe for disaster ? 
  exactly , they look down on the culture of the country they live in but put the culture from their ancestors on a pedestal and for some reason expect others to respect this . 
  if they can not accept the culture of the country they live in then they should move to a country that does accommodates theirs , not expect others to accommodate them . 
   are you stupid ? 
  did you read the article . 
  are you ? 
  did you even read the article ? 
  she is crying because her religion is not getting precedence over others and the school wants to make it equal by banning ** all ** religious practice because you are there to ** learn ** not pray . 
  here is a quote from her sister-in-law , maria fischer walldorf , told radio station radio24syv :  `` one should n't be allowed to force things on others , but there should n't be others who force things on me [ like saying ] that i should follow danish culture and not pray , '' so she does n't want to follow danish culture ( why the fuck are you in denmark then ? ), 
  but she is mad because they can not pray in an ** educational establishment where you should be fucking learning not praying . 
  **  legit u amerifats are so fuking stupid . 
  this is a ** european ** subreddit and the vast majority of comments here are from europeans not americans and they are welcome to post here and voice their opinion without you retards who scream that you are being oppressed because you do n't get special treatment . 
  fuck this hypocrisy and your single digit iq . 
  good . 
  this kind of violence should not be tolerated . 
   it 's important to take into account that it does n't represent all russians absolutely , i know that not all russians feel this way . 
   but as you say , extreme views towards homosexuality are definitely more prevalent and seen as more viable , especially in western russia . 
  i agree , that was the point i was trying to make . 
  russia as a nation seems very homophobic . 
  [ here is a video that shows how some russians act towards two gay people in russia 's capital moscow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgm3lb9juu0 ), 
  he 's just mad his country is turning into a chinese resource colony . 
  did you even read my comment ? 
  let 's look at it again :  tories would ** try ** and destroy our health service ? 
  see that word i highlighted in bold ? 
  they are trying to destroy it . 
  whether they will succeed or not i do n't know and only time will tell . 
  i agree and hope this will be case if we do leave but a lot of people will say it would be used as a gateway for continentals to get into the uk . 
   a decrease in immigration and therefore demand will cause house prices to grow ? 
  yes , very good ... 
  i 'm talking about house prices now and they are not going to suddenly drop to decent levels the moment we leave will they ? 
   hmm . 
  leaving the uk because of something you think might happen . 
  again , yes . 
  very good . 
  i think ? 
  you mean like how nobody thought the tories would try and destroy our health service ? 
  i trust the eu more than them arseholes in the government . 
  the eu may not be perfect by any stretch of the mile but i would rather be in it and have a voice than shout from outside on the sidelines . 
  not even remotely similar , there are major risks to leaving the eu which could increase the cost of living which is already high enough in the uk not to mention the absurd house prices . 
  the eu has been a great boon to our country and not to mention the workers rights that the eu ensures which the tory government will try to take them away if we leave . 
  probably ireland , i just hope the cta remains long enough to get there . 
  never mind scotland , i 'm english and if the uk leaves the eu i 'm leaving the uk . 
  we beat the french too , perfidious albion strikes again !, 
  i remember reading somewhere that there was enough food leaving irish ports to feed ireland 4x over during the famine . 
  although apparently the empire needed to make a profit by starving a million people to death . 
  wasting your time . 
  empire apologists do n't care what the empire did and never will . 
  your facts will never change their rose-tinted view . 
   are you in favor of leaving or remaining . 
  remain . 
   why are you in favor of ( answer question 1 ) i believe our place is in the eu and the benefits we gain are a boon to the country and the public . 
   what do you think the outcome of the referendum will be ? 
  remain . 
   what do you think of nigel farage and his arguments ?
