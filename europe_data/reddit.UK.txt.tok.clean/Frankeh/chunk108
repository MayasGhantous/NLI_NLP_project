  literally every ukip voter i ever saw interviewed looked like a classic labour voter . 
  working class as fuck . 
  we get this same thread every week . 
  what an unbelievable shitcunt . 
  holy fuck . 
  [ here 's a bbc documentary on what gays have to put up with in russia . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2nglma ) it sucks . 
  why would anyone want to subject people to that level of homophobia ? 
  if you do n't have an hour to spare , skip to 30:30 and watch about 5 minutes . . 
  so fucking sad . 
  americans pls, 
  lets get those support groups in place then . 
  the more losing their faith , the better . 
  no really , what would you do differently given the situation ? 
  would you jump of the ** edge ** ? 
  i 'm not sure i 'd be able to convince france to preemptively invade germany , so i 'm not sure how much help i 'd be as chamberlain . 
  plus you must remember when he got off that plane and waved that piece of paper it was cheers , not boos that met him . 
  no one wanted war . 
  [ i was clearly influenced too much by the / r/uk hype train . . ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2hbawl/the_thick_of_it_writer_ian_martin_on_the_labour/ckr5d46 ) should have stuck with my original thoughts . 
  rightmove.co.uk is basically the one stop shop for finding a place to live . 
  it dominates the market . 
  zoopla.co.uk is the only contender . 
  and then there 's gumtree if you want a private let , but i hate using gumtree . 
   before you read to much in to what we say , you should keep in mind that most of the swedish population on reddit , in general , is extremely anti-immigrant when compared to the rest of the population . 
  why is this the case ? 
  most of reddit is left leaning . 
  why are swedish redditors right leaning ( relatively ) ? 
  are you sure they 're not just the only people willing to talk about their displeasure ? 
  [ this is how / r/uk voted in comparison to the actual uk . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzpwjkn.png ) as you can see , british redditors are much more left wing than their counterparts . 
  it seems to be the same for the americans too , as everyone seems to hate the republicans and love the democrats . 
  so what gives ? 
  did you see their competition ? 
  abu hamza is the famous case , but from reading the wiki it seems it had nothing to do with the human rights act . 
  i flew into geneva on my way to france . 
  that is one shitty airport . 
  did n't expect that from the swiss . 
  you heard it here first . 
  the best thing about britain is the lack of british people !, 
  haha . 
  london is * so different * to the rest of the uk . 
  it could be a foreign country . 
  so france beats us on all metrics other than budget , and we win somehow ? 
  what more integration does there need to be anyway ? 
  i do n't want people that stupid in my country . 
  we have enough of our own stupid people here . 
  we do n't need more . 
  pretty sure the government are n't allowed to force someone to live somewhere specific . 
  that 's just being a prisoner of sorts . 
   we 're exempt due to our politicians negotiating an opt out feels good , man . 
  `` sure thing ! '', 
  - other eu countries who is to blame if we have opt-outs ? 
  [ it was 2043 last time i heard this claim . . ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8851902/migrants-to-send-britains-population-soaring-to-largest-in-eu.html ), 
  thank you france for making us look good . 
  ayyy lmao, 
  they 're not special cases , mind . 
  we share each of the opt outs with at least one other country . 
  it 's pretty scandalous given how much money was donated . 
  $ 9bn was donated . 
  that 's 66 % of their gdp . . 
  we might be fat and ugly , but our women put out . 
   turns out that being french beats the alternative . 
  bah , that 's never true . 
  we 're misplaced , surely ? 
  germany is doing better than us by that metric , or am i missing something ? 
  here you go . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35lmgx/france_we_dont_consider_that_prostitution_and/cr5pd6n also , get over the ` enemy ' joke i made . 
  it was a joke . 
  anglo-french banter that goes both ways on here . 
  practice some banter recognition , mate . 
  like ` dog ate my homework ' . 
  so are we just shit hot negotiators or something then ? 
  generally it 's the germans and french that realise we 're okay . 
  all the poor eu countries have a ridiculous chip on their shoulder about us , which i find funny . 
  of course , this is all in the context of / r/europe . 
  i 'm sure the actual populations of those countries barely give a shit . 
  proved me wrong about what ? 
   it 's besides the point anyways . 
  you asked for an enraging opt out the uk 's got . 
  here you go . 
  yes , so i could argue that they 're not infact enraging . 
  the cap is shit anyway . 
  needs scrapping . 
  france refuses to budge on cap reform , so i see no reason why we should scrap our rebate . 
  france makes billions from the cap . 
  much more than we get via our rebate . 
  like a glove . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union we do n't have any opt outs that do n't exist in other countries . 
  and there 's absolutely nothing wrong with opt outs anyway . 
  getting an opt out is more honest a way to go about things than just shutting your mouth and then ignoring the legislation later on when it becomes inconvenient . 
  as for the lisbon treaty , we 're signatories . 
  our opt outs only cover a small part of it . 
  i only had the title to go on . 
  i ca n't read enemy . 
  it 's the perfect crime !, 
   hundreds of them kek . 
  okay m8 . 
  our far right is dead . 
  it was the bnp , and ukip cannibalized their voter base . 
  which opt outs enrage you the most ?
