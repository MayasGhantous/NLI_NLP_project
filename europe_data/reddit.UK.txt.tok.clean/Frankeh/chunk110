  i can get one thanks to my gran being irish . 
  i wo n't bother getting one until the eu referendum is announced . 
  ukip want proportional representation , though . 
  it was in their manifesto . 
  it was in everyones manifesto other than labour and the conservatives . 
  pretty sure no one else wanted to lose to douglass alexander . . 
  but they did n't realise just how pissed off the scottish people were . 
  it was a protest vote . 
  no one thinks she 's actually going to be a better mp than alexander . 
  they could have entered anyone in that seat and won . 
   the core points of conservative politics appeared to be : privatise everything , let the poor pay for the rich . 
  that 's certainly what you 've read here on reddit , at least . . 
  they could literally have entered anyone . 
  these are protest votes . 
  no one can seriously consider her a better politician than douglas alexander . 
  no , some . 
  i wo n't move to ireland . 
  i 'll just get the passport and eu citizenship . 
  you want it to be overridden , though . 
  after all , it 's an unelected house . 
  there 's only so much power you can give to an unelected house . 
  the fact is that if the lords put a hold on legislation it attracts media scrutiny , which in turn attracts public scrutiny which can and often does get the legislation neutered or scrapped . 
  it works very well . 
  an unelected second house protects against on of the biggest pitfalls of democracy , tyranny of the masses . 
  it 's extremely valuable , and in the grand scheme of things fox hunting is n't even worth thinking about . 
  and in the end , it was banned . 
  time and time again they 've stood up for our civil liberties . 
  i 'd campaign to keep the house of lords . 
  the fact that there 's ~ 200 peers who are n't a member of a political party is the best thing about the lords . 
  and the fact they ca n't be whipped even if they are a member of a certain party . 
  house of lords is legitimately a good system . 
  it could do without the bishops and the hereditary peers , of course . 
  we 're gradually getting rid of them . 
  i * really * do n't want an elected second house . 
  the house of lords have been our last line of defense against some pretty shitty legislation in the past . 
  i think most first world countries would benefit from something similar . 
  i thought this was sorted out recently ? 
  an eu referendum is n't a deal killer for nick clegg . 
  if these numbers are right , we 're getting a referendum via a conservative/lib dem coalition . 
  but then again , cameron promised a referendum in 2009 . 
  fireworks for / r/europe in 2017 !, 
  my prediction : labour = 260 conservatives = 300 snp = 48 ukip = 1 lib dems = 28 other = 13 lib dem/conservative coalition repeat . 
  my mistake . 
  it 's still 326 needed though . 
  i was just mistaken about who does/doesn ' t take their seats . 
  time to apply for my irish passport i guess . 
  conservatives + lib dems = 326 that 's enough for technical majority because ~ ~ dup and ~ ~ sinn fein do n't take their seats . 
  illness and death does n't factor into it . 
  it ca n't be correct . 
  i expect snp to win 10 less seats , and add 10-15 for lib dems . 
  the pictures help . 
  either that or i know german . . 
  it 's all we have . 
  reflected in the fact that more university graduates has n't resulted in more patents . 
  as far as i know there 's only two parties in the uk who do n't support electoral reform , and it 's labour and the conservatives . 
  i ca n't see us turfing anyone out either . 
  life is n't fair . 
  us people who 've never been obese will always have shitty calfs , but people who let themselves go for 10-15 years get rewarded with the king of calfs . 
  no fit person gives a shit about what their bmi is , because the proof is in the pudding ( lol ) . . 
  the only people that need to complain about their bmi results are people who look like shit , because if you look good no one 's going to care about some arbitrary number . 
  calories are fattening . 
  carbs just happen to be an easy and tasty way to eat a lot of calories . 
  and there 's insulin response , yadda yadda . 
  but for 95 % of the overweight population they 're just eating and drinking too fucking much . 
  / r/fatpeoplehate is an absolute shithole of a subreddit . 
  i 've seen mods ban and taunt users who admitted to being overweight but working on it . 
  they were n't even going against the circlejerk on there . . 
  they agreed with the premise of the subreddit , but were banned regardless . 
  and they 're mean . 
  just proper mean . 
  / r/fatlogic is good , because it only takes the piss out of delusional fatties and/or people who are trying to promote being fat as something that 's okay . 
  those people seem like fair game to me . 
  / r/fatpeopehate is filled with people that would shout ` fattie ! ', 
  out of their car window if they saw an overweight person jogging . 
  i 'm relatively certain that host countries would n't be too keen on the upset that 'd cause and would fast track visas for those people . 
  i ca n't imagine spain turfing out our 500,000 pensioners for example . 
  it 'd batter their economy for no good reason . 
  also , can eu citizenship be revoked by referendum ? 
  i always figured that everyone already born would keep theirs and anyone born after would n't receive eu citizenship . 
  seems unfair to strip citizenship from 49 % of the uk because the other 51 % do n't want theirs . 
  social media gives us plebs a much bigger audience that could be possible 40 odd years ago . 
  i think it 's probably easier now than ever to get your voice heard . 
  the av vote could have happened . 
  the lib dems just completely fucked it up , or at the very least accepted the tories bullshit terms about what could be on the referendum . 
  the question should have been more vague . 
  ` do you want the government to put forward proposals for alternative voting systems , and then a second referendum in a years time to pick one ? ', 
  but worded better than that . 
  this is why ukip is great for politics here in the uk , imo . 
  they 're going to get ~ 15 % of the popular vote ( most likely ) but they 're only going to get 3-5 seats by most predictions . 
  they 're going to kick up such a fuss . 
  i really doubt countries would turf them out . 
  yep . 
  it 's called first past the post . 
  it 's shit . 
  we had a referendum to get rid of it , but the tories and labour put a ridiculous amount of effort and money into making sure it did n't happen . 
  [ example 1 ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/admin/bkfill/default_image_group/2011/2/25/1298628970292/no-to-av-baby-campaign-005.jpg ) [ example 2 ] ( http://mippr.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/no-to-av-soldier.jpg ) [ example 3 ] ( https://greigdarby.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/no-to-av-rubiks.jpg ) basically no one turned up ( 42 % ) , and out of those that did 68 % voted it down . 
  it really did n't help to have the vote when we did , though . 
  if the lib dems had held off for 2-3 years they 'd probably have been able to convince people it was a good idea . 
  http://www.voterpower.org.uk/ that site explains it better than i ever could . 
  put your postcode into there and there 's an 80 % chance you 'll be very depressed and a 20 % chance you 'll only be mildly depressed .
