  mmm , maybe . . 
  but it 's cheating making the comparison between the uk and catalonia for the uk and continental comparison . 
  southern and eastern european countries have a much different culture to central european countries . 
  germany and france , though ? 
  i honestly think we have more in common with them culturally and politically than we do with americans in general . 
  you 'd never hear them bickering over gun laws or the right to universal healthcare . 
   in short , they are an agent of the devil . 
  ` mummy , what is the uk ? ', 
  [ ` the uk is the devil !, 
  i 'm pretty sure they will . 
  ed just ca n't even entertain the idea now , because anyone in scotland who was going to vote labour just to make sure the tories do n't get in wo n't . 
  do n't worry . 
  i think you 're obese enough to be a nation . 
  do n't listen to them !,

  why would that cause a divide though ? 
  we were still bombed to shit , and we wrecked our economy fighting that war . 
  it 's not like we came out of the war unscathed which i understand would cause resentment between nations . 
  my first hand irl experience is with exclusively californians . 
  not sure why they 'd want to come to sunny ol' england from california , but they seem to . 
  and there 's certainly a difference in culture between us and them . 
  a big one too . 
  but it 's noticeable on reddit generally . 
  on the defaults , some very very strange stuff gets highly upvoted in threads . 
  and on the defaults , america rules the roost when it comes to what gets highly upvoted . 
  they 're more than 50 % of the population of reddit by quite a bit so everything is essentially vetted by american attitudes . 
  and as i understand it , americans on reddit in general are meant to be more liberal than the standard american population . 
  does n't feel it , though . 
   that 's exactly what i think it is . 
  there are parties throughout eu that are ukipx10 but are completely ignored because nobody outside their country has heard of them . 
  swedish democrats are an example of that . 
  not sure they 're 10 times worse , but they are ideologically worse than ukip as a party . 
  and they hold 12 % of seats in swedish parliament . 
  ukip are predicted to get , best case scenario , 1.2 % of seats . 
  although admittedly a lot of that is because of our first past the post system . 
  trying not to have a moan , but at the same time . . 
  i want to moan dammit !, 
   all that is going to happen in this century and while it 's easy to get governments to agree on stuff that 's beneficial to them it 's much harder to get them to agree on something that 's not immediately beneficial to them . 
  and a single powerful federal government helps that how ? 
  if it enacts anything that is for the greater good and it penalizes one country unfairly , that country will just claim independence . 
  i really do n't ever see an eu federation working . 
  we 're not the only country that wo n't like it when/if it comes . 
  i 'm sure of that . 
  when you said ` issues ' above , i figured you meant foreign policy and environment . 
  obviously stuff like trade , education and health ... well we do n't really have any interest in collaborating with that stuff anyway . 
   honestly i think it 's because of our language . 
  the whole of europe can read our news , and they do . 
  i 've wondered the same thing . 
  for example , how many slovak newspapers does a spaniard read . . all our media is in the common tongue of europe , so they get more exposure to us and our politics than we do to theirs and they do to each others . 
  i think the language barrier with europe deceives most people into thinking that we 're more culturally different than we are . 
  i think the lack of a language barrier with america deceives people into thinking that there 's less of a cultural difference than there really is . 
   if you think the nation state as it is today is the future and that it will be able to handle all challenges alone you need to get your mind out of the 19th century . 
  why would we have to work alone ? 
  there 's absolutely nothing stopping the eu and a non-eu country collaborating on solving issues . 
  you do n't need to be a federation to work together . 
  in terms of cultural similarity continental europeans are before yanks every day of the week for me . 
  much bigger culture shock talking to an american than a french/german/italian for example . 
  as for identity , british  english  european . 
   i 'm saying the brexit is a pointless and tired narrative trotted out to sell papers and deflect attention from a lack of ability or ideas among politicians and held onto by certain folk . 
  just for the record , that 's not at all what i was saying with my post . 
  my post was aimed at other nations media , not ours . 
   thing is , no one with a fucking brain is anti-eu . 
  [ someone just posted this further down . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/19/britain-uncovered-survey-attitudes-beliefs-britons-2015 ) so 76 % of people think there should be a referendum , with 46 % leaning to leaving the eu . 
  a higher percentage than that leaning to staying in the eu . 
  notice how more people say there should be a referendum than say they 'd vote to leave . 
  for a lot of people , they just want the choice that a referendum gives . 
  i do n't think it 's right to categorize them all as brainless . 
  like yours , but between the countries in the eu . 
  there 's risk , and then there 's * risk * . . 
   it 's an interesting question what would be better for the eu in the long run . 
  depends on what you mean by ` better ' and ` the long run ' . 
  if federalism is what you 're talking about as an end goal , then without a doubt we 'd be best off having a referendum now and voting to leave . 
  we will leave eventually down the line before the eu becomes a full fledged federation . 
  everyone would be better off if we left as soon as possible so everyone else can get on with that , and we can get on with finding our place in the world outside of the eu . 
  there is no end scenario that has us in a federation . 
  it 's just not going to gel with our culture and history . 
  ideally we 'd just remain a member of a reformed eu with no interest in federalization . 
  in all likelihood we 're going to see a labour/snp/libdem coalition . 
  there 's no chance of a tory/ukip coalition , because there 's no chance of those two parties combined holding a majority . 
  he should just rule it out . 
  they do n't have unlimited funds . 
  they have to pay to get on those boats . . 
  might die . 
  so there 's a chance they wo n't . 
  you need to remove the hope from the situation and make sure they know that if they try and cross into italy , they ** will ** end up back home . 
  the more people who end up back where they started , the more they 'll talk , the more it will become known that it does n't work , the less boats will come . 
  and the fines for that ran into the multiple billions . . hardly them ` doing whatever the heck they want ' , is it ? 
  we 'll have a whip around . 
  the boats will stop coming eventually . 
  no one will keep paying money to the smugglers to smuggle them if they know they end up in a row boat 5 miles from the libyan shore . 
  large initial outlay for overall savings . 
  their military capacity is limited to their own country and countries they boarder . . and even then it 's poor . 
  they could declare war , but they could n't actually do anything war-y . 
  i also find it hard to imagine that they 'd declare war because we 're trying to stop people from running away from their country . 
   and mantaining a close blockade would require a considerable logistic effort our navies could do with the exercise . 
  but the likelihood of dying trying to row to italy is much higher than that of just living in libya . 
  serious question . 
  what if we pick them up , take them as close to the shore of libya as possible and then put them on row boats and give them oars to row ashore . 
  we found them in the sea struggling , we saved their lives , and now it 's up to them to get back to land if they do n't fancy dying .
