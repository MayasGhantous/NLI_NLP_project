   the city of london completely ignores financial regulations and do whatever the heck they want . 
  you want to back that up with facts ? 
  i 've been saying it for a while . 
  us as the ` baddies ' of the eu is an entirely manufactured affair . 
  our actions do n't back up our reputation at all . 
  we 're outspoken , but we tow the line if we 're ignored or outvoted . 
  i do n't understand why being a passive member is seen as a good thing on here . 
  if you do n't fight for your countries best interests , it 'll eventually lead to resentment when they 're not considered . 
  it might not be the * only * way , but it 's certainly the only way anyone 's found so far that works . 
  i agree with it , and i think eu countries should share the burden of having to detain , process and send them back . 
  it certainly should n't fall on italys shoulders alone . 
   and them paying for themselves is very much debatable . 
  it 's really not . . 
  they cost # 32m a year , they own a few billion pounds of land that they forfeit the profits of . 
  around # 250m a year . 
  yeah , that 'd be pretty weird . 
  but imagine if it was n't ride of the valkyries , and instead was [ this ] ( http://www.youtubedoubler.com/?video1=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3d8ptirfrpz-0&amp;start1=10&amp;video2=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dgrvzhu-_lcu&amp;start2=3&amp;authorname=snoopsagan ) . . now that 'd be real weird . 
  he 's probably the best royal after the queen . 
  i 'm convinced he thinks royalty as a concept is stupid and just has to go along with it because it 's what the queen is into . 
  as such , he plays a caricature of a royal for bants . 
  # 6.70 p/h = almost no pay ? 
  literally 15 pence less than frances minimum wage . . big deal . 
  also , zero hour contracts are completely played up . 
  the majority of people on them are n't looking for more hours anyway . 
  they look extremely pleased to be released from their shackles of employment , money and having nice things . 
  we 're gaining on the yanks . 
  i always go after the worst odds , with the most gain . 
  so i 'll put a bet on germoney . 
  could these measures not be implemented non-uniformly ? 
  there 's jobs that must be within france . 
  like checkout staff , for example . 
  you ca n't outsource checkout staff . 
  or traffic wardens . 
  they need to be in the country . . 
  etc , etc. 
  could n't the rules only be applied to professions that are non-outsourcable ? 
  does it matter ? 
  ` ugh , i fucking hate christians . 
  better go to italy ! ', 
  we dicked germany and france . 
  it 's like football , but the complete opposite . 
  seo is going to get easy as fuck , lol . 
  they 'd probably rather stop servicing france than give it up . 
  seems sensible . 
  we already field weapons which ` attack without human intervention ' . 
  phalanx when armed will attack anything that satisfies its own rules of engagement . 
  but japan has cyberdyn . . 
  but do n't worry , they only make mechanical exoskeletons , [ wait what . . ] ( http://www.cyberdyne.jp/english/ ), 
  seriously . 
  flying the english flag is a big social no no in england . 
  sporting events are the only real exception . 
  i see the anarchist sign scrawled around now and again . 
  never swastikas . . 
  trident can work independent of gps . 
  it uses star map guidence . 
  what next ? 
  going to remove him from their christmas card lists ? 
  well stalin and hitler tag teamed poland in 1939 . . that 's probably why no one was in much of a rush to save stalin . 
   10bn a year lolno, 
  you 're fundinentally misunderstanding how the missiles work . . 
  where the hell do you live ? 
  yeah , you have to be really short sighted to not see how good the cost : benefit ratio is with trident . 
  plus trident is a fucking cool name for sub based icbm 's . . 
  i thought they never leave scotland . 
  i knew they drive them to and from the two relatively close bases . 
  why do they have to come all the way down here ? 
  seems like quite a low key affair , actually . 
  once you give them up , you ca n't get them back . 
  i do n't think we should get rid of our ~ 150 or so until the us and russia are down to their last 150 . 
  then we can reduce with them . 
  an argument can be made that globalization is so complete at this point that a world war is in almost no ones interest . 
  but then russia goes and fucks with ukraine and now i do n't rate that argument too highly . 
  the moat did not work . 
   uk should increase military presence there to deter any invasion . 
  we honestly have more than enough there at the moment . 
  we could do with upgrading our island based sams . 
   no carriers . 
  dude , what ? 
  we famously sent carriers . 
  i still think we should recognise argentinas ` it 's closer ' argument and hand over the falklands . 
  then we can use it as precedent to finally claim what 's rightfully ours . 
  france . 
   theres only a losing side in a war . 
  no matter of the outcome of said war . 
  usa disagrees . 
   if the falklands where captured right now that 's the bit that 's impossible for argentina now . 
  there were 80 troops in 1982 . . now there 's 1,500 . 
   what part of `` is n't the military power it was anymore '' confused you ? 
  the part where we 're more capable in that region now than we were in the early 1980 's . . military personnel on island in 1982 = 80 military personnel on island in 2015 = ~ 1,500 and there 's two eurofighters , a type 45 floating around near by , subs probably lurking . 
  and the base can be re-garrisoned in ~ 48 hours by air , which was one of the major requirements when it was built . 
  aircraft carrier does n't really mean shit when we 've got a base there now . 
  there 's no need to reclaim it , because argentina has no realistic chance of taking it in the first place . 
  their military is essentially unchanged since 1982 . . 
  they were a more equal match back then . 
  now they 're decades behind . 
  eh , the raf base was designed to be re-garrisoned to after war levels in 48 hours by air . 
  we would n't need a fleet of anything . 
  i 'd rather they just keep rattling their sabre and do nothing . 
  [ we had a deal to share oil revenue with argentina ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/20/world/britain-and-argentina-reach-an-accord-on-falkland-oil-rights.html?pagewanted=1 ) but they backed out . 
  we were being generous with the offer back then .
