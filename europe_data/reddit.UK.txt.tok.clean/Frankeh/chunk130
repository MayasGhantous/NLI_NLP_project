  scotland did n't need a supermajority for their referendum either , and it was more of a big deal than leaving the eu would be . 
  that 's not how financial services works . 
  ` okay guys , we 're all going to move . ', 
  ` lolk ', 
  undecideds are almost always votes for the status quo . 
   probably not . 
  student unions just were n't as whiny a century ago . 
  they probably were , but there were still important issues to fix such as womens suffrage . 
  now we 've run out of actual inequality , so we 're making up new injustices to try and fix . 
  devolution 2.0, 
  what if our ` subsidies ' result in cleaner fossil fuel technologies being used than would otherwise ? 
  probably because you 're not paying attention , and get the majority of your foreign news from reddit . 
  it was a joke , because there 's a popular redneck culture in sweden . 
  try reading ` comment is free ' and tell me with a straight face it 's not primarily clickbait leftist half-truths shite . 
  okay , mate . 
  exactly . 
  when oap 's die , they get replace by more . . sure , they tend to get more left over time but so does the conservative party . 
  the guardian ? 
  misrepresenting the truth to further their agenda ? 
  surely not . 
  they 're the daily mail of the left . 
  we give with one hand , take with another . 
  we tax all oil and gas companies an extra 50 % on their profits . 
  that 's not even accounting for normal corporation tax . 
  do any other eu countries have a similar tax ? 
  erm . . [ those in glass houses . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raggare ), 
   we can only hope that the damage that they cause is reparable . 
  not by corbyn an co. . . that 'd be like setting yourself on fire , and then trying to put yourself out by swimming in liquid nitrogen . 
  lol , transparent as fuck . 
  it was n't fleeing !, 
  it was progressing backwards at pace !, 
  that 's why cameron is so soft during pmq 's . 
  he 's trying to baby corbyn towards the 2020 election . . having corbyn still be leader going into the election is the ideal situation for the tories . 
  you do n't even have to do that . 
  there was some other leader of the opposition who refused , and they just ignored it haha . 
  no , kneeling is just part of being sworn into the privy council and various other honours/duties . . 
  most people do n't kneel for the queen . 
  they just bow or curtsy . 
  how the hell are we losing to the yanks ? 
  they have tornados and forest fires and shit . . 
  i wonder if this means we 'll start getting real winters . 
  that said , warmest november on record so maybe the cold anomaly is having a different effect on our climate than expected ? 
  climate is such a complicated beast . 
  everything seems so entwined and chaotic . 
  looks like the entirety of the uk is in canada too . 
  it 's 16 degrees where i am . . 
  in the middle of november . 
  top work , gulf stream . 
  germany is the one doing all the inviting . . 
  what , so we just export our troublesome citizens so that they can go massacre innocent people half a world away ? 
  what kind of bullshit export is that ? 
  fuck no . 
  regardless of if it 's uncomfortable to admit , our society created these people . 
  letting them run riot in a far away land is n't being a responsible society . 
  we 're responsible for them . 
  arrest them , put them in prison . 
  nothing . 
  because that 's an average from 2007-2013 , whereas the telegraphs is just for the year 2013 . 
  currently , we 're much larger net contributors . 
  very slim loss is probably the best result , in my view . 
  it leaves us the option of doing it all again further down the line if needs be . 
  a decisive win to stay would n't be my first choice , even though i 'm reasonably supportive of the status quo . 
   britain and france won both wws and gained a lot in both victories , i do n't know how anyone can claim with a straight face we benefited from ww2 . 
  we bankrupted ourselves fighting it . 
  obviously there was the benefit of making sure the nazis did n't have control of europe , and that 's a huge benefit . 
  but that was a benefit for all of europe , not just us . 
  ww1 , yes . 
  you can claim we benefited , even though we did lose many millions of our men in that war we gained land . 
  i just ca n't agree that we unfairly benefited from ww2 . 
  we did n't . 
  it ruined us , although in the long run that was probably a good thing as it forced us to wind down the empire . 
  that said , that 's a huge claim of tax credits for an average family . 
  and tax credits are for people who work low paid jobs . 
  possibly lends credence to the idea that eu immigrants come here , work low paid jobs , and drive wages down for everyone . . 
  it 's not an ` or else ' because the decision is n't david camerons . 
  he ca n't issue an ` or else ' because he 's leaving it up to a referendum . 
  what is civil law ? 
  probably not . 
  [ that is not true . 
  at least not for 2013 , and i 'm not sure where to find newer fitures . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/11221427/eu-budget-what-you-need-to-know.html ) ** italy ** contribution : 17.2 bn money back : 12.55 bn net contribution : 4.65 bn ** uk : ** contribution : 17.1 bn money back : 6.3 bn net contribution : 10.2 bn you only have about 5 million less people than us . 
  cba to do the maths , but there 's no way it works out to us paying the same per capita given that your net contributions are half ours . 
  [ yeah , it 's a bit more than just a comedian being unfunny . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/30/north-west-racist-woman-plane_n_5543327.html )  `` this lady stood up in the cabin in first class and yelled at the top of her lungs , ` she 's with a black guy , and that baby is black !, 
  and you need to shut that black baby up ! ' '', 
  so to sum up , in their short time in austria : * a comedian basically called her a ` nigger in vienna ' to her face , on tv . 
  i dunnoo ) then dressed up in black face and tried to get near her , claiming to be kanye * some random woman started hurling racist abuse at her baby on a plane . 
  that aint normal . 
  it 's not like it 's an isolated incident . 
  there was that famous case last year where kim kardashian swore she 's never return to austria after experiencing a pretty absurd amount of racism . 
  i mean i could n't care less about kim kardashian , but when even celebrities are getting racist abuse aimed at their baby you have to wonder . . 
  6/10 would be generous . 
  i do n't understand what we 're doing wrong here . 
  can you help explain ? 
  how on earth do you manage that , though ? 
  i dunno , if it 's just that . . http://www.thelocal.at/20151030/salzburg-erasmus-student-quits-due-to-racism, 
  read a blog entry the other day about a black london teenager who was an exchange student in austria . 
  needless to say , these results do n't surprise me now . 
  fair enough , but i doubt the eu is going to become * more * militarily powerful with a uk exit . 
   to cease any pretence that her agriculture be privileged hahahahaha .
