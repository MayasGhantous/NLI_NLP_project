  it was a failure , yes . 
  but i do n't understand how having an even more deadly and trigger happy team of army guys would have helped matters . 
  and it 's one failure , and it 's about the only one . 
  mostly an intelligence failure , too . 
  how about these police who managed to shoot , and not kill , the lee rigby murderers : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsewgkttc9a so they got to stand trial , instead of getting martyred . . 
  finally , you pay for armed police anyway . . you 're not disbanding your armed police and swapping them with grunts . 
  it 's not like you 're saving money . 
  your arguments are weak . 
  were they even armed ? 
  maybe they had pistols . 
  not really [ armed police ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03158/paris-manhunt_heat_3158455c.jpg ) , though ... you know , the guys you call in . 
  bobbies are going to get fucked up regardless of if the army is on standby . 
  i just do n't see the point of using the army when you have police whose remit should be this kind of thing . 
  i 'm not emotional , i just have no idea what you 're trying to say . 
  what myth ? 
  that a game is a set of rules ? 
  that 's not a myth , that 's fact . 
  factory worker enters into an agreement to sell the stuff he produces at # x per hour . 
  wait , pizza is n't italian ? 
  literally what the fuck are you babbling on about ? 
   you did n't invent it , you set rules for it . 
  all a game is , is a set of rules . 
  [ english article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/egypt-britons-stranded-sharm-el-sheik-flights-uk ) and elsewhere :  egypt says that the number of rescue flights easyjet had wanted to schedule was just too much for the airport to handle . 
   `` the british airline wants to schedule 18 flights at the same time and wants to transport british passengers from sharm al-sheikh without their luggage , which we would have to transport later , '' hossam kamal , egypt 's minister of civil aviation , told reuters . 
   `` this constitutes a huge burden on the airport because its capacity does not allow for that . 
   `` we have asked them to organise eight flights only and one plane will transport luggage . '' seems pretty fair , tbh . 
  i know it 's not natural , but regardless it 's not worth the trip unless you 're travelling to cornwall anyway and do n't mind a bit of a detour . 
  football . 
  french armed police should be able to hold their own against a few gunmen . 
  that 's basically their entire remit . 
  rocket launchers sounds like scaremongering to me . 
  they 'll be used before the army ever get called anyway , unless you expect these isis blokes to be riding in armed convoy or something , lol . 
  i guess you could say ... ** i guess you could say ... ** they 're finnished !, 
  that 's a bit much . 
  that 's what police are meant for . . 
  yeah , you go ahead france . . we 'll catch up ... ^ ^ in ^ ^ six ^ ^ years . . 
  mate , the billionaire donor of the conservative party who was n't given the cabinet position he was promised by dave , told * the daily mail * that he heard a guy mention he 'd seen a dave stick his dick in a dead pigs mouth . 
  what more proof do you need ? 
  funniest part of the whole thing was seeing people who usually hate on lords , billionaires , crony politics and the daily mail change their tune and support all four . . 
  part of the history of the celebration ( other than guy fawkes ) is to remember the people from lewes burned during the marian persecutions . 
  that 's why the parade has so many [ burning crosses ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/lewes_bonfire,_martyrs_crosses.jpg ) too . 
  although they also burn the pope every year . 
  * might * want to hold off on that part . 
  [ as is tradition . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-29915270 ) i like the cameron/clegg one better . 
  the shitstorm the alex salmond one created was hilarious . 
  scottish people even called the police about it . . 
  because his entire image is based on being a geopolitical hardarse . 
  if it turns out isis killed that many innocent russians , he 'll have to respond with a show of force bigger than what he 's already fielding . 
  that makes no sense , because people will just insist on a referendum and leave if they feel they 're being screwed by the eu . 
  then they leave and the eu becomes a weaker institution . 
  it 's a bit over 1 % of gdp . 
  hardly the end of the world . 
  irelands gdp grew about 6 % this year ... 
   germany does the same thing with their constitution hans : `` should we put ` no starting world wars ' into it * this * time ? '', 
  otto : `` nah , why limit ourselves like that ? '', 
  it does n't seem like a mouth full to me . 
  is n't that pretty standard of trade deals ? 
  there has to be standardisation . 
  and we already follow those , plus more . 
  if we left , we could get rid of the ` plus more ' . 
  lots of people here picture some kind of ` vengeance ' being enacted on us for daring to leave , which is preposterous . 
  what kind of bullshit message would that that give to the eu ? 
  stay with us or we 'll hurt you ? 
  practically a hostage situation . 
  we 'll get the free trade deal , i 'm just wondering if we could get one without a load of bullshit terms attached that makes leaving in the first place pointless . 
  that was not a well formed argument . 
  when it comes to planes falling out of the sky , the possibilities are literally endless . 
  i 've watched enough ` air crash investigation ' to learn that . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china_airlines_flight_611#metal_fatigue that 's a plane that disintegrated in mid air after a shoddy repair following a tail strike decades earlier . 
  sound familiar ? 
  a bomb with no one claiming responsibility seems like a much less likely scenario . 
  staying in could have severe implications too . 
   expats are directly and massively impacted by the result of the referendum . 
  reality ? 
  countries introduce a fast track way for british expats to get residency as not to disrupt their country and population too much . 
  what will actually happen ? 
  countries who want the uk to stay in will be able to manipulate that 5m voter block by saying those people will have to go home if it 's a ` leave ' vote . 
  but a general election is n't as important as a leaving the eu referendum . 
  you ca n't correct your vote 5 years later with a referendum like this . . 
  it 's way too early to tell . 
  i generally doubt the claims of ` experts ' who comment so soon after an event . 
  air crash investigations take months , if not years . 
  yep , that 's very good . 
  i really like the ` new york deli ' one too . 
  really , they 're all good . 
  fookin huge prawns in the prawn one . 
  and people complained when cameron said he did n't want juncker as president of the eu . . [ lots of people in this thread shitting on him for it , and welcoming juncker . . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/298sc7/jeanclaude_juncker_nominated_as_eu_comission/ ), 
  [ the ones that look like this . 
  ] ( https://media.timeout.com/images/101826061/320/210/image.jpg ), 
  literally just last week i was wondering if we could tap icelands geothermal power capacity to power our country . 
  anyone know how much potential there is in iceland ? 
  why is that relevant ? 
   they 've been working on that engine for like 30 years and have n't built any kinds of prototypes or anything . 
  it 's suffered a bunch of set backs , a lot of which are political . 
  the government initially backed it , then unfunded it , then classified it top secret which tied the hands of the inventor . 
  it also means he is now wary of any investment from the government . 
  also , it 's wrong to say they 've not created a prototype or anything . 
  they just recently created a pre-cooler that can cool air from 1000 degrees c to -150 degrees c in less than 20 milliseconds . . that has been one of their big hurdles . 
  it 's still too heavy , mind . 
  but managing to cool air that quickly , from those temperatures , is a huge breakthrough .
