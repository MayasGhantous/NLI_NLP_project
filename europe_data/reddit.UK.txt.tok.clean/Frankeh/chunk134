  ` is this the issue , is n't this the issue ? 
  we 'll never find out , because / u/gooncommathe wo n't fucking say . ', 
  so what am i misunderstanding ? 
  and i 'm asking for you to help me ( and maybe other reading ) understand . 
  what bit of the issue am i misunderstanding ? 
   no offence , but yes your children are your responsibility ... 
  which is why he/she will select the ` yes , i want the adult filter enabled ' option when setting up their isp account . 
  what alternative are you suggesting ? 
  op sits with his child every time they want to use the computer or tablet ? 
  i take it you do n't have much experience with kids . 
  what practical difference does it make if one option is larger than the other ? 
  help me out , here . 
   ` reporter talks to terrorist , gets his laptop confiscated under talking to terrorist laws ' not as enticing of a headline . 
   well , i had to send the mrz of my passport to giffgaff so i can access porn . 
  that was annoying . 
  it 's been like that since the advent of mobile internet in the uk . 
  i remember physically having to go into an orange shop to get the adult filter lifted , and that was ~ 2006 . 
  that 's just companies covering their arses , and nothing to do with the government . 
   anyway , porn filters are retarded , if someone wants to see porn , he is going to find a way ( using tor , as an example ) . 
  but as a first line of defence to stop a 6 year old on a tablet from seeing some stuff he 's maybe not emotionally ready to see ? 
  is he going to hop on tor ? 
  these filters clearly have a legitimate use . 
  the fact that so many people in this very thread recommend third party software alternatives prove that they have a use . 
  https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope and at best , it 's a 1 % gradient of a slope . . 
  you 're the one that mentioned freedom , though ? 
  and neither of us mentioned security . 
  come on , form a full fucking argument so we can have a proper conversation . 
  piffy one liners do n't help anyone , and rarely have much meaning . 
  can you explain how one makes me more free than the other ? 
  either way i 'm relying on software someone else has programmed . 
  but what 's the point of setting up filters individually on all your devices using a variety of software on a variety of os 's when you can just ask your isp to deal with it ? 
  what do you mean by the government enforcing it , because it was done in the loosest manner ever . 
  1 ) they did n't even create any legislation 2 ) most , if not all , of the companies currently operating the filters had them setup as opt-in anyway . 
  3 ) all the filters are independently run by the isp 's and there 's no oversight by the government . 
  basically , your example of an infringement of human rights seems to be the government saying to isp 's ` make your filters so when you ask them about them , the ` yes ' option is slightly bigger than the ` no ' option . . ' you 're caught up in the hysteria , to be honest . 
  [ and this is why the government cares in the first place . . ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dh+porn+site%3ahttp%3a%2f%2fwww.mumsnet.com%2ftalk&amp;oq=dh+porn+site%3ahttp%3a%2f%2fwww.mumsnet.com%2ftalk&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.303j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=utf-8 ) read a few of those threads . 
  what difference does it make if you set it up at the isp level or the device level as long as * you 're * the one setting it up ? 
  what principle is it violating ? 
  i genuinely do n't understand . 
  you can literally just click ` no thank you ' . . 
  can you reword that , i do n't understand . 
  seems like pedantry at best . 
  it makes no practical difference which is bigger or smaller . 
  the british government bullied the isp 's into doing this to appease mumsnet voters , knowing full well it does n't matter because of the implementation . 
  now the eu are forcing their hand to actually make it a law , and no doubt they 'll fuck the law up and the required implementation will be way worse . 
  there 's so much hysteria here on reddit about these filters . 
  [ this is an example of what you see when you first use your internet connection here in the uk . . ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/71795000/jpg/_71795679_71795678.jpg ) is it really the 1984 madness it 's made out to be here on reddit ? 
  also worth noting that there 's currently no law on the books to require these filters . 
  how is it absurdly china-sided ? 
  as much as the media is trying to make out that a # 92.50 strike price is outrageous , it really is n't . 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65713/6883-electricity-generation-costs.pdf ) # 92.5 per mwh is much lower than lots of other sources . 
  maybe he did ? 
  i mean , scotland are still part of the uk are n't they ? 
  we invited them for tea . 
  apparently that makes us a vassal . 
  other countries we 've invited to tea in the past few years : [ merkel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmusv-7bmzm ) [ harper ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln9yiv1wt5i ) [ obama ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp85zrg2cwg ) [ higgins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifm2r7uezgc ) etc , etc. 
  a few a year , basically . 
  that allegedly makes us a vassal of all those people . 
   ** on a serious note ** this article is great in how it reports the debate while making subtle little digs at the outers the entire time . 
  if you want people to detect your sarcasm , you really should n't prefix it with ` on a serious note ' . . 
  i mean , i like to think i 'm pretty good at detecting sarcasm even on the internet . 
  but even i have my limits . 
  personally , i 'd say there were only 3 events . 
  the racist apartment guy should count as one , imo . 
   if the debate near lowestoft , a down-on-its-luck fishing community , is anything to go by no shit that fishing communities will be anti-eu . 
  the common fishery bullshit of the eu fucked them hard . 
  given that people on here repeatedly describe a vengeful eu not allowing the uk into a free trade agreement if we leave , i 'd say the eu sounds more like the abusive partner . 
  i 'm not sure that clear bias makes articles good . 
  turkey gon na turk . . 
  english language , music , movies and tv . 
  all are surprisingly popular around the world . 
  jimmy rustling is another one . 
  do you actually think being in the eu changes countries general psyche ? 
  it 's more that most eu countries were already very much on the same level , culturally . 
  then they created the eu . 
  beat the french . 
  today was a good day . 
  ireland . 
  there 'd be damn near no culture shock . 
   they are eurosceptic and will probably try to fight just about everything . 
  wooo , renegotiation ally . 
  this is a no brainer . 
  the average brit only thinks about france when it comes time for their holidays . 
  there 's no real animosity with the french . 
  they do their thing , we do ours . 
  meh , just fine boat/train companies # 50,000 per illegal immigrant they let on the boat/train at the french end . 
  there 'll be a de facto border set up there by the private companies . 
  i only found out recently that snooker and darts are almost exclusively british sports . 
  barely anyone else plays them competitively . 
   we manage alright well meme 'd friend . 
  if you come here illegally , then obviously you 're a criminal . 
  it 's called * illegal * immigration . . 
  there 's a nod to this in that new netflix film ` beasts of no nation ' . 
   the potential to surpass china is there and they are actually a democracy . 
  being a democracy is likely hindering their progress . 
  largely uneducated population + democracy = not good for society . 
  that 's where china is doing it right . 
  autocracy during the growth stage makes sense . 
  every european country did it . 
   nobody cares to mention it you 're literally commenting on an article about it in the guardian you twerp .
