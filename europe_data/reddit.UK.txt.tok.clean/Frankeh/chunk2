  member nations should not be picking and choosing which eu rules apply to them , ** especially not to the extent the uk is doing . 
  ** [ page 11 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/docs/docs_infringements/annual_report_31/com_2014_612_en.pdf ) so when will you be advocating that germany , italy , france and spain leave ? 
   uk just wants all for itself . 
  give us the benfits , do n't bother us with responsibilities . 
  [ page 11 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/docs/docs_infringements/annual_report_31/com_2014_612_en.pdf ) go do one . 
  [ page 11 . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/docs/docs_infringements/annual_report_31/com_2014_612_en.pdf ) out of all the major powers in the eu the uk plays together the best . 
  we 're just vocal about bullshit we do n't like , which every country should be . 
  it 'd be too many englands !, 
  also , i think new england that just straight up copied a shit load of englands city names . 
  that 's make it even more confusing . 
  worcester , hartford , stamford , manchester , etc. 
  [ eyeballing it , i 'd say about 50 % are nicked !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_by_population_in_new_england ) so at the very least we 'd need you to return the names to their rightful owners . 
  there 's only a difference to people who are n't willing to let go of the dream . 
  no one should queue that close . 
  my mistake . 
  the eu does n't tax financial transactions coming into the eu at the moment . 
  why would they start ? 
  if the answer is just to spite the uk , then maybe the eu is n't really something anyone should be a part of . 
  besides , no one would want to use the eu banks if access to their markets was taxed . 
  the number one issue in the uk in terms of the eu is immigration . 
  being just in the eea would solve that issue . 
  many people would be fine with paying the same amount and conforming to all the trade related regulations . 
  they 're hardly draconian anyway . 
  japanese city culture seems to be very full on from what i can tell . 
  ultra high sensory stimulation everywhere you go . 
  what , work yourself to death for peanuts ? 
  your flair does not surprise me . 
  i get in this argument at least once a week . 
  it 's fucking horse shit and they wo n't admit it . 
  a slight accent and a different kind of pizza is n't a fucking culture . 
  well i genuinely think that china will be the biggest threat to world peace at some point in the next 80 or so years . 
  so that 's going to be interesting . 
  it 'll be a war of resources , most likely . 
  bras were rationed ? 
  interesting ... . . 
   i remember how stoked i was when i ate my first orange , it was amazing . 
  it 's amazing how shitty communism is . 
   oh , where do i even begin , probably queueing . . queuing for everything . 
  communism does n't sound so bad . 
   he was a bully in school for that to be a valid criticism on its own you have to accept that people ca n't change . 
  i do n't accept that . 
  anyway , he seems like a bit of a smooth operator . 
  that 's enough of a reason not to trust him . 
  i would seriously love for that to happen . 
  with free movement , of course . 
  if i had to pick , eu or au ( anglo union ? ), 
  then i 'd pick the anglo union every time . 
  irish grandma . 
  so i get auto irish citizenship if i want it . 
  dual citizenship , ireland/british . 
  not much will change for me . 
   this would mean that the bulk of eu regulations that affect goods ( e.g. , labeling , safety , frequency spectra ... ) would have to apply in the uk . 
  no one really minds those things . 
  blair decided against adoption of the euro even though we were eligible . 
  that 's what i was referring to . 
  the british public were strongly against it at that point ( 1997 onwards ) . 
  ** united kingdom ** * i went to sick halloween party . 
  yeah , it 's a shame we were n't brave enough to economically castrate ourselves . 
  in the event of us leaving either the contributors will need to make up the difference in the budget , or the takers will be given less money . 
  in either scenario questions will start being raised as to whether the eu is ` worth it ' . . 
  struck of the christmas card list and when they see us in the supermarket they 'll pretend they did n't see us and start examining the potatoes really carefully . 
  apart from all dc wants it reform too . 
  he does n't want to leave . 
   why britain was allowed to keep `` own '' currency and for what reason ? 
  because we had the foresight to opt out of it and keep full control of our own monetary policy . 
  i 'm betting a few eurozone members are kicking themselves now for not doing the same . 
  three times the disruption !, 
  what fun !, 
  scotland believed that they 'd have devo max 244 seconds after the referendum ended . 
  it 's been just over a fucking month and everyone 's complaining . 
  ridiculous . 
  give it time . 
  if in a year you 're nowhere near anything proposed then you have the right to complain . 
  complaining at this stage is naive as fuck . 
  explain the swedish democrats , then . . 
  even the us with its extremely strict immigration criteria has the ability to buy your way in with $ 500,000 of investment . 
  we 'd likely have a similar system in place , if we do n't already . 
  i 'm trying to imagine what would happen if david cameron tried such a stunt . 
  china is their competition in terms of manufacturing . 
  the frequency of them has gone up a huge amount . . that 's why they 're significant . 
  enemy of my enemy . 
  did you try just making eye contact ? 
  that 's never failed for me . 
  it 's not expected that they 'll be pestering you , and it 's also not expected that you 'll shout for them . 
   then we went to pay the bill and the waiter said that the manager had covered it all for us . 
  roughly $ 80 . 
  that 's going the extra mile , because you can be sure that i 've visited that place often after that since they have shown that they are serious about providing great service . 
  what does that have to do with tipping , though ? 
  i agree , that 's great service . 
  but they did n't do it because you tipped . 
  presumably , you did n't tip at all that time . 
  it 's just institutionalized bribery , then ? 
   bars $ 1 per beer or shot , $ 2 for a cocktail . 
  this will help you get served faster , especially if you 're making them make you cocktails . 
  this is the most ` wtf ? ', 
  for me . 
  $ 1 for ever beer ? 
  bar tenders would be on # 100k a year salaries if we did that over here .
