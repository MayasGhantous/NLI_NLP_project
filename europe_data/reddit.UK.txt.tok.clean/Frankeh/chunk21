  that 's the saying , at least . 
  that 's never been russias game plan , though . 
  they 've never wanted the world , they 've just wanted everything directly bordering them . 
  at least that one was a comedy and all in jest . 
  [ this one , on the other hand . . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/u-571_ ( film \\ ) ), 
  you have to respect them for the pure size of the submarines they used to build . 
  in terms of defence , russia is more than capable of countering what you listed . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p-270_moskit ) [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p-700_granit ) [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p-800_oniks ) i think they can all be launched from submarines/planes so that honestly puts any ship at great risk . 
  a low flying plane , for example , wo n't be picked up . 
  over the horizon radar has n't been perfected . 
  if you hug the sea , then pop up when you 're within range ( up to 600km for some of those missiles ) they do n't really stand much of a chance . 
  the missiles themselves are also designed to hug the ocean , so the time these ships will have to react is next to nothing . 
  add in strength in numbers tactics ( launch multiple missiles at the same time ) and whatever you 're aiming at is getting sunk . 
  ships having been archaic giant floating targets for decades now . 
  look at what happened in the falklands war . 
  or the uss stark for a more recent example . 
  subs are about the only naval asset that still make sense . 
  all the rest ( particularly carriers ) are only good when you 're up against an enemy who does n't have any weapons made in the past 2-3 decades . 
  only possible way to counter this is with lasers , which the us navy is working on . 
  pretty sure dresden was brought up at school . 
   the first world war should n't be revered as some heroic time for the british people . 
  it was a horrific war that was entirely avoidable and the people who died were only pawns for the imperialistic leaders of britain and germany at the time . 
  but the end result of ww1 was the dismantling of two empires . . 
  so there was clearly a net positive result in terms of getting rid of imperialism . 
  then ww2 ended the last two empires . 
  i think there 's a lot of people in countries that were formed after ww1 that would disagree with the ` pointless war ' angle you 're giving . 
  we already have the infrastructure needed to fill our stadiums , because they get filled regularly with premier league matches . . 
  the point of fifa is to promote football around the world . 
  if they only give the world cup to countries that have loads of stadiums and fans then it 's all a bit pointless . 
  you 're preaching the choir . 
  neither did brazil . 
  ohhhhhhhh . 
  [ here 's the one in my home town ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/37/51/2375147_25cecdf6.jpg ), 
  the documentaries paxman did were really great , imo . 
  not overly jingoistic . . just decent historical documentaries . 
  grauniad just complaining to complain . 
  its technical name is ` banter ' . 
  he 's talking about ww1 , m8 . 
  you certainly did n't fund the whole thing . 
  not even close . 
  plenty of countries have the infrastructure . 
  besides , the last world cup was in the americas , ffs . 
  if anywhere should get it it should be england . . we have n't had one since 1966 . 
  you do n't get one again so soon . 
  flight 17 . 
  we get the 2022 world cup then . 
  the dead have spoken . 
  i think it 'd cost us # 50 to host . . 
  get out . 
  qualify by default !, 
  our favourite kind of qualifying . 
  even wales is having a go !, 
  we 're both trying to undersell our countries to keep the others from visiting . 
  like when your mother in law comes to stay and you do n't hoover for a week . 
  i honestly think the only course of action is to create a bigger arse with a bigger pulse jet engine . 
  the idea of two huge metal arses with pulse jet engines blaring both aimed at each other across the channel just cracks me up . 
  in my head the french side has the inventor dressed in a black and white stripe t-shirt , black beret and throwing onions into the sea in the direction of england . 
  colin needs to grow a large beard and dress in tweed . 
  always look on the bright side of life . 
  the kind he has no personal experience with . 
  nuclear is the only sane choice . . we need to just go ahead with committing to a nuclear powered future . 
  i think the question on everyone 's lips is clear . 
  are you even trying , everyone else ? 
  it 's diet fascism . 
  you do n't want to see proper fascism . 
  i very much doubt that . 
  i 'm not going to leave the uk . 
  i 'm just going to do it to remain an eu citizen . 
  i 'm claiming my irish citizenship if we leave the eu . 
  i imagine there 's quite a few others who will be as well . 
   remember what happened last time they started marching armies all over europe ? 
  didnt end well for anyone . 
  give it a fucking rest . 
  [ yes , actually . . ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-mh17-crash-make-putins-oligarchs-pay-for-ukraine-disaster-9617644.html )  britain will urge other european countries to extend travels bans , asset freezes and business sanctions on any individual or entity in russia deemed to be `` influencing or supporting '' the `` putin regime '' . 
  ` cor , that title seems a bit antagonizing ! ', 
  and then i looked at the site . . 
  lets not link to the daily mail , shall we ? 
  when putin can just confiscate your oil wells at will , he 's the boss . 
  there 's no better way to show your disapproval of the actions of israel than looting yourself a new pair of nikes and an ipod . 
  that is a huge problem , no doubt . 
  but integration ca n't happen until countries start taking their military seriously . 
  and that means they should be funded to a decent standard . 
  the eu should really be spending ~ $ 400bn on defense , but we 're only managing a piddly two hundred and something billion dollars , with the 4 you listed there making up the vast majority of that . 
  it 's a joke to let the other members have a say in how those big military players use their militaries . 
  like i said . 
  when they start pulling their weight , they can have a say . 
  until then , sod off . 
  not putting our men on the line because of some vendetta some eastern european countries have with russia . 
  refrigerated , though . 
  so at least * some * care is being taken . 
  i am not anti-american . 
  okay , so nato also has to protect all the countries you see in your crystal ball now ? 
  this subreddit sometimes , i swear . . 
   military spending = / = foreign policy . 
  in its simplest form , yes . 
  military spending does equal foreign policy . 
  if you do n't have a way to kill the foreigners , then your policies towards them by and large do n't matter . 
  especially if they have a bigger military than you . 
  eu : ` do this ! ', 
  other nation : ` no ' eu : ` okay we 're going to apply sanctions ! ',
