  that 's about # 250bn , iirc . 
  we should honestly take a loan out tomorrow and just fucking do it . 
  nationalize the whole industry . 
  power is too valuable a resource to leave up to individuals . 
   if uranium starts growing on trees , at least . 
  it 's not like it 's extremely easy to stockpile or anything . . 
  and if they create a low as fuck grade parmesan cheese ? 
  that will taint the reputation of the original . 
  this is really just regional trademarks by another name , and no one in the us seems to have much of a problem with trademarks . 
   why does the american or hell , anywhere but europe cheese have to be called '' parm styled '' or something similar . 
  * sigh * europe is n't a single country . 
  if you make parmesan style cheese in the uk you ca n't call it parmesan . 
  we call it ` hard cheese ' . . 
  it needs to be made in parma , italy . 
  always slice downwards to the chopping board , otherwise the corner comes off !, 
  this is what we have to deal with on the default subs . . 
  if you 're going to come into a european sub then you 'll equally have to deal with the bullshit tribalism that you 're probably not used to when posting on regular reddit . 
  sorry , but fair is fair . 
  ( i 've only given upvotes in this thread , for the record . . ), 
  you might as well try a west country farmhouse cheddar . 
  the term is protected for a reason . 
  it 's basically the last stronghold of the ` cheddar ' name . 
  there 's good cheese in the us , and there 's bad cheese in the us . 
  it 's a huge country of 300m people . 
  it 's pretty much a given they 'll have good and bad of every food and drink imaginable . 
  so this legislation will be really good for america as well , no ? 
  we wo n't be able to make ` wisconsin cheese ' or whatever . 
  i do n't feel like we can be blamed too much . . we do n't have access to your best . 
  the only stuff we really get on any mass scale is the stuff your huge multinationals push which i think we can all agree is mostly shite . 
  hopefully the free trade agreement will mean we 'll get these foods more freely from smaller companies who make higher quality foods . 
  plus it looks like it 'll also aim to protect such foods from eu competition . 
  the thing is , this legislation will work both ways . 
  we wo n't be able to call anything tillamook cheddar and piggyback off the success of it . 
  i think it 's generally a good idea for everyone involved . 
  there 's just something about that processed shit that tastes so good melted on burgers . 
  whenever i see someone put decent cheddar or something on a burger it just does n't feel right , and it certainly does n't taste as good . 
  i do n't think anyone in the uk has ever heard of ` old english cheese spread ' . . 
  if anything , that 's an example of what this legislation hopes to prevent . 
  for example , here in the uk all clearly parmesan cheese that is n't from italy is called ` hard cheese ' and usually has a picture of some spaghetti on it to make it clear what kind of cheese it is . 
  anything labelled parmesan is from parma , italy . 
   vaccuum cleaner bad example , surely . 
  very rarely do i hear people call a hoover a vacuum cleaner . 
  i agree with your point in general , though . 
  i was trying to find affiliate networks in austria the other day via google and it would literally no accept that i meant austria , not australia . 
  it did n't even do a ` did you mean ' . . 
  so infuriating !, 
  oh right , that explains it . 
   for a test , in one day , i once drove 300 miles at a constant 35 miles per hour and got 70 mpg . 
  how ? 
  how on earth did you do that ? 
  and now radar that brakes for you . 
  how much are speed limits in the uk followed ? 
  you only have to drive on our motorways to see that they 're followed only when the police are near by . 
  otherwise the right lane is 90mph and the middle lane is 70/80mph with the left seemingly being 55mph and full of lorries . 
  brake , tyre and radar technology are all increasing but we 're bringing out speed limits down . 
  it makes no sense . 
  the speed limits were set 50 years ago when cars had drum brakes and weighed 2 tons . 
  the huge majority of cars are designed to be most efficient at 30mph , 55mph and 70mph . 
  20mph you go slower and use more fuel . 
  it 's a load of shite . 
  i thought we were meant to be increasing our green credentials . 
  * sigh * ** cyprus ( 59 deaths ) : ** town :50 km/h single carriageway :80 km/h motorway :100 km/h ** uk ( 28 deaths ) : ** town :50 km/h single carriageway :100 km/h motorway :110 km/h by your logic , they should have less deaths . 
  clearly there 's more to it than speed . 
  not by as much as i expected , though . 
  speed limits are ridiculous . 
  in my city we 're now down to 20mph in the majority of it , which literally no one does . 
  speed does n't kill . 
  shit driving kills . 
  i just drive whatever speed i feel safe driving at . 
  sometimes that 's 20 in a 30 , sometimes it 's 30 in a 20 , sometimes it 's 50 in a 30 , sometimes it 's 90 in a 70 . . 
  i 'd much rather spend time concentrating on looking out for hazards and driving than checking my speedo . 
  so what 's the deal ? 
  why are we dunking on the rest of europe when it comes to road deaths ? 
  is there actually something to be said for driving on the left in terms of safety ? 
  get on our level , eu - oh , you did . . 
  fighter drones are clearly the future . 
  it seems completely ridiculous that we 're still putting people we spent millions training into our fighters . 
  keep them on home turf in a bunker underground somewhere and away from harm . 
  plus you can pull way more g 's in a drone with no fleshy bit in the middle . 
  i really do n't understand what we 're supposed to do . 
  we impose trade sanctions , they cut off gas to europe . 
  that will hurt us a little bit , but will hurt other parts of europe and the eu much much more . 
  especially ones with a large industrial base that rely on cheap gas to keep their economies moving . 
  the eurozone is still fragile after 2008 . 
  maybe our leaders do n't want to rock the boat when it 's already taken on a ton of water in the past few years . 
  because the world runs on money . 
  number stations work with one time ciphers . 
  that 's the most secure form of encryption there is . 
  jokingly , sure . 
  well we 'd collectively have about $ 100bn more military equipment/staff each year . 
  that 's quite substantial . 
  why would they shoot fresh water ( a valuable resource on a ship ) into fire ? 
  you not been reading the newspapers ? 
  this whole thing started as a disagreement between russia and ukraine on when m. night shyamalan 's career went down the shitter . 
  those hoses shoot sea water . . 
  we literally have none , apparently . 
  although we have the capability to make them and do make them for export markets . 
   do we not have any sort of defence against them ? 
  a way to stop the nuclear material within detonating , a way to shoot the missile down before it reaches its target , something ?!, 
  not really , no .
