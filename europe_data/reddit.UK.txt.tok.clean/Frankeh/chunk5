  that 's a pretty outrageous sum , but i still believe nuclear is absolutely necessary . 
  even at that price . 
  it 's likely any fission reactors we build in the coming decades will be the last fission reactors we ever build . 
  i think we 're pretty close to getting fusion working in the next 50 years or so , and yes i know that 's a bit of a trope but we 're a lot more advanced now than when scientists started saying that 50 years ago , haha . 
  anyway , yeah . 
  i see fission as the only logical stopgap between fossil fuels and fusion . 
  i was sure he was donkey kong . 
  as if . 
  i 'm of the opinion that without energy independence the next 100 years are going to be hellish . 
  i would rather quit the eu and funnel all that money into building reactors for the next 20-30 years . 
  seriously . 
  that 's how big an issue i believe energy is going to be . 
  this debated charge alone could build half a reactor . 
  are you really shitting on charity ? 
  the fuck ? 
  no , we 're at the least risk because we have the nhs and we 're very well equipped to deal with a pandemic . 
  we even run drills . 
  ebola is a poor people country problem . 
  it can take hold in poor countries because they have fuck all facilities to deal with it . 
  i would just like to quote barroso the other day . .  `` david cameron wrote to all of us about ebola ... what would be the influence of a prime minister of britain if it was not part of the european union ? 
  his influence would be zero . '', 
   the eu allowed gb to subsidize hpc which is pretty ridiculous in the first place . 
  we should be able to subsidize whatever we want . 
  we have a population to service . . 
   let 's get this clear : they all agreed to these new calculations and the possibility of an extra payment . 
  they all knew this was about to happen . 
  can i get some details on this ? 
  when it happened , who gave it the go ahead , etc ? 
  imo this whole two governments thing is a complete ball ache . 
  i can barely keep up to date with the huge amount of bullshit our government is doing day to day and then there 's the eu on top of that doing all their bullshit . 
  how is anyone meant to stay properly informed on the lot of it ? 
  the biggest pro of leaving the eu for me would be a vast simplification of who i can call a tosser when something goes wrong . 
  it 's amazing how delusional you lot are . . 
  when has the eu ever been that forceful ? 
  it 's certainly not going to be that forceful to one of the biggest contributors , with one of the biggest euroskeptic demographics . 
  edit : for reference he said something along the lines of ` fine , if they do n't pay in december it 'll be 3bn in january !, 
  we 're not messing around here ! ', 
  yeah , to be fair there 's zero way that cameron found out about this on the daily mail website . . 
  he 'd have known way before that it was going to happen . 
  fines ? 
  the eu is pretty gutless . 
  when have they ever brought the hammer down on anyone other than maybe greece ? 
  and that 's like kicking a guy when he 's on the floor anyway . 
   so he 'll manage a discount i 'm really going to enjoy the thread on here if that gets announced . 
  sorry if i sounded a bit harsh . 
  it 's just it does n't seem like a very useful a way to display the data to me . 
  appreciate all the work you put in , though !, 
  [ this guy explains it . . ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2k6fe3/diy_map_reuropes_20132014_survey_results/clig62l ) tl ; dr op fucked up the displaying of the stats . 
   you learn a language to get a different perspective , not to converse with a lot of people . 
  i find it hard to believe that 's the number one reason people learn a language . 
  wow , that really is a pointless statistic . 
  a shame too , the site looked real swanky !, 
  the eu is nothing like a real government . 
  it has nowhere near the power . . 
  how anything in the eu works is a riddle wrapped up in an enigma to me . 
  it seems kind of insane that we 're expected to understand how two entirely different governments work and keep track of exactly what they do so they we can vote in an informed manner . 
  i 'm leaning towards an exit to be honest . 
  it 's all too complicated . . fuck it . 
  i 'm not a full time politician . 
  i have a job and other commitments . 
  it 'd be easier to not downvote you if you did n't say such stupid shit . 
  for a continental european english opens up about 360m europeans to converse with ( 51 % of europeans speak english either as a second language or first ) . 
  the reward of learning the language is well worth the cost in time and effort . 
  there 's no comparative language for us to learn . 
  if we learn french we 'd maybe now be able to converse with 66m extra people , assuming no french people know english , which is n't true . . spanish would make the most sense in global terms , but it 's not like we can drive to argentina or mexico . . just spain , so the same argument as above applies . 
  for us to get the same benefit we 'd likely need to learn 4-5 languages . 
  if not more . . 
  i think we get entirely too much stick for this . 
  lmao , number of full time employed . . poland 25 % , uk 15 % ... no one else breaks single fucking digits !, 
  i 'll remember this when the / r/europe talks about anything to do with taxes . 
  that 's more of an indication that our budget is large , not that the amount being wasted here is small . 
  to put it a more emotive way it 'd be a # 9,714 pay bonus for every nhs nurse . 
  yeah , but your economy is  5 times as large . 
  i 'm sure if the rest of the americas demanded $ 16bn of your country your people would throw a shit fit too . . 
   `` the surcharge stems from the eu changing the way it calculates gross national income to include more hidden elements such as prostitution and illegal drugs ... '' and then :  `` france , meanwhile , will receive a $ 1bn rebate ... '' looks like france is a square !, 
  that 's extremely rich coming from a fucking yank . 
  if i did that for romanian commenters on here i 'd have to conclude that everyone in romania hates the uk and are really mega butthurt about it for some reason . 
   maybe you want to make no payments to the eu , get double representation in the european parliament and only participe in european programs you like ? 
  that sounds fantastic . 
  where do we sign ? 
   there is a net benefit . 
  a stable and thriving eu that uk takes part in and benefits economically . 
  just to play devils advocate here , [ we pay ~ # 8bn to the eu ] ( https://fullfact.org/economy/cost_eu_membership_gross_net_contribution-30887 ) . . now assuming a 5 % profit on produce exported and a 20 % corporation tax it would mean we 'd have to do ~ # 800bn of trade to make that back in tax . 
  obviously there 's other benefits too such as decreased unemployment and the social/tax income benefits that come with that . . 
  i believe we currently eu trade is worth about # 400bn . . 
  but then there 's also cuntish tax ` avoiding ' companies which are * partly * enabled by eu free trade ( irish double quadruple chocolate sandwich , or whatever ) , so maybe that amount of trade needed is actually higher . 
  also , do n't rant about jersey/isle of man ... 
  i know we have our own tax havens . 
  so yeah . 
  just a bit of fag packet maths , but it still shows it 's not * that * clear cut . 
  it 's quite possible that this is a shite deal for us and we 're being strung along . . 
  personally , i 'd rather not rock the boat . 
  but i can understand why some people might want to . 
  not really , though . 
  if we had as much power as germany does when it comes to the eu we 'd not give a shit about this extra payment . 
  so is it really a separate issue , or is the problem just a lot of issues ? 
   nordic : cool can we have one thread where we 're not inflating their ego ? 
  [ same as the uk . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/oct/22/ukips-polarising-effect-support-for-staying-in-the-eu-hits-23-year-high?cmp=twt_gu ) as you can see , [ immigration is a bigger issue than the eu . . ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1413200917879/icm_poll_issues_141014_web.svg ) so that presumably means people would rather reform the eu so immigration is more limited rather than leave . 
   but no one is it at the level of the uk .
