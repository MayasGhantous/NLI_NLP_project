  was n't he shooting elephants in a place where they 're a pest ? 
  ni would n't want out of the uk . 
  strong gyno . 
  seriously . 
  i ca n't even imagine the kind of stuff he 's done and got away with . . thing is , once you 're dead all you leave is what you were . 
  that 's your legacy . 
  he probably wo n't want to taint that . 
  the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did n't exist . 
  yeah , poor form germany . 
  the saying goes ` if at first you do n't succeed , try and try again . ', 
  you 've got one more go !, 
  opened the flood gates . 
  who said germans do n't have a sense of humour ? 
   a war of aggression against liechtenstein in order to force democratization and abolish serfdom . 
  that cracked me up big time . 
  [ challenge accepted , op ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpbvrprghso ), 
  if they 're a group of criminals , surely they can be put in prison because of all the crimes they committed . 
   sweeden = atheist utopia to be fair , there 's always some cunt swede humble bragging whenever sweden is mentioned . 
  it gets tiresome . 
  about time . 
  what 's the fucking point of them ? 
  we need to get rid of them too , imo . 
  [ do n't be a kant . . ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rygy-j_oh5q ), 
   they just stole it from the nation . 
  the whole idea of land ownership is based on someone who took the land by force . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  i bought the land my house sits on off a guy , who bought it off a guy who bought it off a guy , who bought it off a guy , who bought it off a guy , who bought it off a guy , who bought it off a guy , who was awarded it by the royals after they stole it off a guy . 
  so i should give back the land my house sits on ? 
  stick to eu subs ? 
  lol , russia is n't going to invade anyone . 
  are usd not cash ? 
  the one i was interested in ( rent ) was n't on there ... 
  so i wonder if we 're going to step up ? 
  [ uk ` to lead world ' on aid for syrian refugees ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23942037 ) unless we match that , sweden is ` leading the world ' when it comes to syrian aid . 
  shit makes me want to fight germans against ridiculous odds . 
  under . 
  under for sure . 
  [ oh do n't know m8 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarin_gas_attack_on_the_tokyo_subway ) . 
  because they genuinely can be used against us quite easily . 
  we 're doing better than germany is this year . 
  we 're doing better than france has managed . 
  it 's in our best interest to not let jihadists get chemical weapons . 
  ( looks at the rest of europe ) mhmm . . 
  i just ca n't support military action in the manner everyone is suggesting . 
  ideally we need to send in troops but the political will is n't there . 
  that way we can remove assad , kill the jihadist rebels and secure then destroy the chemical weapons and chemical weapons manufacturing infrastructure . 
  in my opinion all a limited attack on assad does is weaken him to the point where the rebels might be able to gain control of chemical weapons and while i dislike what assad did i know that those chemicals would be much much more dangerous in some of the rebels hands . 
  syria is basically what were were sold in 2003 . 
  but we were lied to and it 's sort of a case of crying wolf . 
  [ or in the words of a great man . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekgpy1adc0a ), 
  such is life . 
  i was trying to figure out which european language has ` pota ' as ` six ' ... 
  it is the same every time . 
  it 's not even funny . 
  labour get into power and spend a shit ton on social programs we ca n't afford . 
  loads of debt . 
  public get pissed and call in the debt busters ( tories ) who then reduce the deficit by removing all the nice but expensive social programs . 
  ` oi , where 's my free shit ?! ', 
  votes labour back in so everyone can have some nice social programs again . 
  ` oi , what 's with all this debt then ? ', 
  repeat forever . 
  bonus points , everyone saying ` oh , the economy was set to recover anyway before the tories got in ' ... no one learns . 
  that does n't really make sense when the uk is pretty much the best recovering large economy in europe right now . 
  there 's really not much worth risking ww2 over . 
  especially not some war torn middle eastern country . 
  they 're a dime a dozen . 
  lithuania sounds like a grandma just happy to get a visit . 
  what decade is he living in ? 
  hague has been beating the war drum much louder than any other country for the past few months . 
   we have the ability to stop a civil war going on for more than 2 years this action will not stop the civil war . 
  it may or may not weaken assad enough to cause him to lose , in which case the current 5 + factions of the rebels will start warring between themselves . 
  boots on the ground is the only option that would stand a chance of ending it , but that 'll never happen . 
  to be fair , the point of war games to to learn from them . . 
  i agree with your assessment though . 
  a saturation attack is the way to take down a carrier group . . an enemy only needs to get lucky once or twice , whereas the defender must get lucky every single time . 
  that said , iran do n't seem to have many weapons that are capable of being launched against ships and the ones they do have are in far too few a quantity to be used in that way . 
  iran pose no real thread to a carrier group . 
  [ britain , france and the us right now . . ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-4iqrcdv4 ), 
  i have no clue . 
  maybe he genuinely believes he 's right . 
  pretty sure the lesson we learned from iraq is that we can act without un security council unity . 
  lol , you 're mad . 
  no one wants * that * war . . 
  especially not russia . 
  to be fair , it feels like we 're the ones doing the majority of the warmongering on this one . 
  hague has been beating the war drum for months when it comes to syria . 
  he set the line at chemical weapons way back and now he 's just desperately hoping they 've been used , and been used by the correct person . 
  i 'm convinced this is a false flag attack by the rebels . 
  what easier way to get assad beaten than making western nations do it for you ? 
  if i was a rebel hearing the warmongering and seeing the chemical weapon line being drawn in the sand then i 'd be looking at doing a false flag . 
  you 'd be an idiot not to , tactically . 
   have to pay back debatable if these loans will ever realistically be paid back . 
  even if they do , the current interest rate for the first bailout sits at 1.5 % . . that 's less than inflation ( 1.6 % ) , which means greece can just sit back and let inflation erode away the debt . 
  apart from yes they are . 
  if i have # 10,000 loan debt , # 8,000 credit card debt , a # 100,000 mortgage in arrears and no job , then a bank gives me a very low interest loan for # 118,000 then that 's a fucking gift given my financial situation . 
  it 'll be a fucking miracle if a profit or even break even is ever made from the greek bailouts .
