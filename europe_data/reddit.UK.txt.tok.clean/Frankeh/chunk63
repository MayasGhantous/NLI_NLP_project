  anywhere else in the world you 'd not be liberal . 
  just an fyi . 
  actually , i do n't think you 're even liberal by us standards . 
  if i was to hazard a guess i 'd bet the only properly liberal policy you support is universal healthcare . 
  check your geography privilege , sweden . 
  200km boat ride will get you onto the shores of malta from africa . 
  it 's 4,100 km from africa to sweden and you have to pass through 3-4 other countries ( which are also perfectly nice places to live . 
  probably nicer than sweden given the weather such immigrants are used to ) . 
  it 's easy to have lax as fuck immigration policy when there 's little actual chance of immigration on any meaningful scale . 
  actually , nevermind . 
  dae swedish master race ? 
  tourism industry will probably see the advantages . 
  photovoltaic is kinda shitty anyway . 
  huge cost , very little power produced . 
  also producing the panels is generally terrible for the environment . 
  thermal solar is really the only decent form of solar power at the moment . 
  i ca n't help but feel he just saw all the assange fame/drama and wanted a piece of it . 
  everyone wants their 15 minutes . 
  he could have leaked the stuff anonymously ( he 's a sysadmin . 
  it 's well within his ability to remain anonymous online ) and kept leaking , which would have been more useful . 
  now everyone 's distracted by his whereabouts and other completely unimportant shit . 
  tl ; dr he has achieved his aim of becoming famous . 
  meh , unpopular opinion but the only bit i actually like of the eu is the freedom of movement it allows . 
  everything else is just shite . 
  if there was some way to keep that freedom of movement without everything else , i 'd vote to leave . 
  ` fucking wanker ' , no one would say ` bloody wanker ' . 
  bloody quitters . 
  for queen and country !, 
  ( no one mention edward ... la la la la ), 
  i do n't even care . 
  i know they 're stupid but they still make me giggle . 
   which was the whole point . 
  there 's no such thing as `` total war scenario '' . 
  ww2 was a total war scenario . 
  had the cold war gone hot that also would have been total war . 
  this whole comment thread stems from someone from iceland claiming that their military matters after someone else said that iceland is under the protection of nato . 
  the argument is getting so abstract and off topic now . 
  point is , the icelandic forces are small enough that for all intents that they do n't matter in any practical sense . 
  they ** are ** under the protection of nato . 
  i was n't going to look through all 28 members states wikipedias to count the submarines . 
  i just looked through the big military players wikipedias and counted them . 
  if you want 100 % accuracy then feel free to trawl through and count . 
  either way it 's not going to be anywhere near 72 . 
  i 'd hazard a guess it wo n't even be near 31 . 
  how many of the 28 members are landlocked countries , for example ? 
  they wo n't be adding up to 72 ( or even half ) and they wont be operating under a single command structure . 
  occupy , no . 
  beat ( neutralize threat ) , yes . 
  not the sense of self awareness , doc !, 
  anything but that !, 
  is it serious , doc ? 
   theirs can be easily spotted even if that 's true , which i have my doubts about , the eu submarine force is still laughably small . 
  if we 're just counting the useful attack subs it 's : italy = 2 germany = 4 france = 6 uk = 7 so we 're talking about 19 subs vs 72 subs . 
  even ** if ** ours are technologically superior to theirs that 's a ratio you just ca n't beat . 
  right , got it . 
  thanks . 
  the eu would n't stand a chance either . 
  next to no power projection and certainly none which would survive us forces . 
  our few aircraft carriers would be sunk quite promptly if they left port . 
  so that 's our chances of striking mainland usa diminished almost entirely . 
  then they 'd just park their 11 carriers off our coast and bomb our infrastructure until we surrendered . 
  our subs would probably be our best bet but even then the usa has 72 of them . 
  i know it 's tongue in cheek , but the cod wars are no indication of military power and they were n't even wars . 
  sabre rattling at best . 
  had it been something serious the entire icelandic coast guard would have been sunk promptly . 
  politically it looks pretty bad killing a bunch of small islanders over some fish which is why it did n't happen . 
  it 's like people that point at the us armed forces and go ` lol , they 're not that powerful . 
  ca n't even beat a country armed with 1960 's soviet tech ! ', 
  well sure , but that 's because the gloves are well and truly on . 
  in a total war scenario ( nukes not included ) the us armed forces would devastate any nation on earth bar none . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i said for all intents and purposes , they do n't exist . 
  if any medium sized force wanted iceland for some reason then 380 men is n't going to stop them . 
  one battalion of the british army would almost outnumber them 2:1 . . that 's just a single battalion !, 
  i 'm not trying to be offensive . 
  just pointing out that they absolutely do rely on the nato powers for protection . 
  i ca n't make head or tails of what you just said . 
  icelands entire military is 380 people , 170 of which are reserves . 
  for all intents and purposes it does n't exist . 
  i feel left out . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  yes , but if they 've not made up their mind come voting day it 'll be a status quo vote . 
  so a no vote . 
  in the majority of cases , it 's a vote for the status quo . 
  have n't read the article ( to give a truthful answer ) , going to attempt to answer the title question . 
  basically , the eu gives out a load of farming subsidies to countries . 
  some countries have a big farming industry and some ( like the uk ) do n't . 
  the countries who have big farming industries get a shit load of money from the eu kitty . 
  to fair things up a bit , the uk asks for a rebate as we do n't receive any of that farming money . 
  how 'd i do ? 
  i 'm politically retarded . 
  this might be all wrong . 
  unfortunately no one at the nsa understands german . 
  that was my reaction too . 
  ireland before uk/usa , yeah i think not . 
  election coming up . 
  typical diversion tactic to distract from internal problems and unite the people against a common enemy that is n't merkel . 
   `` voice or no voice , the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders . 
  that is easy . 
  all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked , and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger .
