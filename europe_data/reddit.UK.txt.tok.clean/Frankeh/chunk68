  but it 's all in one place , and all at once . 
  are there really toilets where you can end up facing another bloke ? 
  firstly , that 's awfully awkward . 
  secondly , after my 5th litre i will purposely seek out people to stand in front of just to be purposely awkward . 
  honestly , i 'm more likely to throw up smoking than drinking . 
  keep the party going around them and wait for them to wake up refreshed ready for another 5 hours of drinking . 
  who are the worst tourists ? 
  there 's only one way to find out ... ** [ fiiiiiiggghhhttt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kxg02vf.gif ) **, 
  oh yeah , this happens with romanians now too . 
  you made it sound like it was a government initiative or something with the word ` camps ' . . 
  i think ` thousands ' is an overstatement , btw . 
  enlighten me , then ? 
  i think it should be up to countries to decide who does and does n't come to their country . 
  i agree we should be taking some in ( from refugee camps only ) , but countries should do it because they want to . 
  this is why it 's always important to have emergency cocaine for when you fucked up and drank too much . 
  or significantly less shitfaced , at least . 
  yes he is . 
  i do n't think any of that . 
  people moaned a bit about them terking er jerbs . 
  they did n't put up barbed wire to keep them out , call them killers and herd them around on trains . . 
  that 's an awful lot of projecting you just did . 
  translation error ? 
  i sometimes wonder if tone and nuance does n't translate that well from language to language . 
  that seems like a really hard thing to predict . 
  lone gunman is easily the hardest target to spot . 
  no collusion , no communication , almost no chance of stopping them . 
  you want terrorists ? 
  because this is how you get terrorists . 
  alienate people enough , and they 'll get pissed off . 
  [ eats popcorn with denmark and ireland ] this gon be good . 
  what 's wrong with wellies ? 
   i just find it much easier to argue against something when you break each point down into its component pieces . 
  so many times it ends up looking like someone trying to guess the jigsaw puzzle picture without putting it together . 
  often it ends in debating details rather than arguments . 
  then it devolves into arguing semantics , and before long neither participant is even talking about the subject at hand . 
  woah , i 'd never thought of it like that . 
  wood shoes are just a really bad idea . 
  onions should be around neck . 
  wait , do we even have traditional dress ? 
  does that stuff morris dancers wear count ? 
  only thing coming to mind . 
  i guess a little black dress that is 3 sizes to small being worn by an overweight woman , in the height of winter ... that 'd be our traditional dress nowadays . 
  it 's annoying because if you break a persons post down sentence by sentence to answer sometimes the context is lost and you 're answering the wrong questions . 
  best to read the entire post , then answer with an entire post . 
  [ i might look a little something like this . . ] ( http://www.youtubedoubler.com/?video1=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3doaq5jzanse8&amp;start1=&amp;video2=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dvxvjye39mtq&amp;start2=68&amp;authorname=snoopsagan ), 
  i did n't even get to bring out the big guns of my campaign . 
  was going to campaign on banning the french language , and also the dutch in general . 
  language , and people . 
  fair one , thanks for the answer . 
  oh man , people who quote and answer like that drive me mad too . 
  glad i 'm not the only one . 
  given that the short list is only nine people , that seems like a bit of a foolhardy tactic . 
  now you 've just got people pointing out an obviously bad candidate and wondering ` why did the mods see in that guy ? ', 
  which does n't exactly instil confidence . 
  did you not do a cursory search of his post history , though ? 
   i think we should also ban bbc . 
  we 've all seen how biased their coverage of the immigrant crisis was , after all . 
  que ? 
   it 'd be unfair on those candidates that did n't make it if we started publicly shaming them . 
  you have my permission . 
  i was ** robbed ** !, 
  pretty disgusting what we did to them . 
  i ca n't fathom how citizenship for cooperation was n't an absolute no brainer . 
  generally the little witch girl scared me . 
  i do n't remember that sketch . 
  what 's the premise ? 
  us leaving in general is n't going to happen either . 
   i think a seismic constitutional change such as leaving the eu would provide the scottish nationalists with enough reason to justifiably want another referendum on independence . 
  unless the majority of scotland vote to leave . 
  it 'll be same as the scottish referendum . 
  the ` leave ' side will be extremely loud and passionate , but the ` stay ' side will just silently vote for the status quo . 
  in black mirror it ends a prime ministers career . 
  in reality , it probably contributed to the start of ones career . 
  i do love the idea of lord ashcroft sitting down to read ` call me caitlyn ' , though . 
  to be honest , i only chose this inquisitr article because the title was just right . 
  none of the others mentioned pig fucking in the title , and i ca n't editorialize . 
  hey , man . 
  i do n't diss your cultural heritage !, 
  what i 've learned is that mild sexual assault gets shit done . 
  i bet that 's what they said after the 49/51 quebec vote , and now the movement is dead . 
  yeah , what a dumb link to make haha . 
  no one cares about caitlyn jenner outside of the usa . 
  well , you asked for our solution to the calais crisis . 
  here it is !, 
  if you shoot a bullet parallel with the ground , and drop a bullet too , they 'll hit the floor at the same time . 
  well that 's actually quite surprising . 
  not at all . 
  i think the rush for a basic income is a purely cynical ploy by some people for some free money . 
  there 's absolutely no need to rush into a basic income . 
  lots of fearmongering about how robots will take all our jobs , we 'll have 25 % unemployment , and we 'll all be penniless without a basic income . 
  well if it starts going that way , we can just implement one . 
  it 's not such a complicated concept that it would take decades to set up . 
  it could easily be set up in a year or less if needs require it . 
  why risk fucking everything up when we 're at 5.8 % unemployment and everyone 's doing relatively okay anyway ? 
  so yeah , it 's a fringe idea . 
  it might get wider acceptance at some point , but only if the conditions come to fruition . 
  we 're mostly isolated from the immigration crisis , though . 
  i 'm not sure it 's enough . 
  if the eu enforce quotas , then that really could rock the boat . 
  apparently only fools and horses is famous worldwide .
