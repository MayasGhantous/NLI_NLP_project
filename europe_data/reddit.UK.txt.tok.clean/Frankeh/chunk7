  even if it 's true , you do n't make it known !, 
  [ ca n't fault bill kazmaier for having the most outrageous traps ever , though . . ] ( http://123cuantomide.com/wp-content/uploads/bill-kazmaier-250x250.jpg ), 
  [ `` what 's a gulag ? 
  that 's not really important . 
  if they 're lurking and upvoting/downvoting then that 's all that matters . 
  an estonian might comment being pro gun ownership for everyone , but going against the grain of the average estonian and european . 
  then it might make it to the top because of the american upvotes . 
  the comments might not be by americans , but no doubt they help choose which ones make it to the top . 
   the community here is very prejudiced against those who are a ) not european and b ) those who are not 100 % behind the confederation of europe into a single country . 
  aka , the british . 
  italy have one of the largest mailitaries in europe . 
  see , little cultural nuances like this will be lost . 
  plus i like the bit in the front of my passport where the queen orders all the dirty foreigners i 'm visiting to show me a good time . 
  just looked up the french , german , danish , latvian , polish and italian passport . 
  they all follow the same standard . 
  burgundy with gold crest . . why throw that out for a fisher price looking shite passport ? 
  bosnia was before tony blairs time . 
  sierra leone i had forgotten . 
  kosovo , afghanistan , iraq . 
  which ones am i forgetting ? 
  yeah , it was great . 
  i remember everyone being so happy that tony blair was elected . 
  then he got us into three wars , ran the government in an almost constant # 30bn deficit during the biggest boom the uk has ever seen , oversaw the introduction of tuition fees , and mostly likely set in motion the death of the nhs with the private finance initiative . 
  and then labours final blow on the way out was to leave a # 160bn deficit for the tories to clean up . 
  they 've updated his firmware to stop that error now . 
  the politically ignorant have always been drawn to labour because of their promise of more free shit paid for by nevermind shhh . 
  ukip is powered almost exclusively by the politically ignorant . 
  they were always going to cannibalize labour . 
  i have clearly met my match in this discussion . . 
  and the democrats in the us would be further right than ukip in the uk . 
  pretty terrible example for you to give . 
  tories are n't right wing , and it 's wrong to call them that . 
  they 're centre right , labour and lib dems are centre left . 
  then you have ukip on the right and the the greens on the left . 
  now you 're framing opinion as fact . 
  well that 's one way of not forming an argument i guess . . 
  with the euros coming up and roi , ni , wales , scotland and england all leading their groups ? 
  do n't be like that , france . 
  it 's our culture . 
  we do n't hide the baguettes when you come over . 
  [ not * strictly * true . . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virgin_atlantic#history ) probably ca n't be done nowadays , but there was a time it could be done on a shoe string budget . 
  not internet start up money , but still only # 1m . 
  i half read the wiki for the wrong indigo airlines . 
  the fact the wiki said it wound down in 2003 and was based in the usa should have set off some warnings in my brain . . 
  anyway , it 's not quite as impressive . 
  they bought 100 planes right off the bat . 
  they had heaps of money from the get go . 
  holy tits that 's a huge amount of planes . 
  i had to look up indigo . 
  apparently they were founded in 1997 . . how amazing is that ? 
  just 17 years after founding the company they put in a $ 25bn order for 250 planes . 
  putin : yeah , but aneonazisayswhat ? 
  ukip splitting the tory vote is a big fear of mine . 
  we 've got a reasonably good thing going here ... 
  i do n't want labour coming in and fucking it up like they always do . 
  i 'd like the lib/cons for another 4 years . 
  the lib dems while mostly useless do serve as a small and much needed thorn in the side of the tories . 
   nothing . 
  wrong !, 
  we were being fucking legends . 
  [ this guy on / r/uk always does a great break down of the figures . . ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2jav0a/uk_unemployment_falls_below_2m/cl9z7he ) tl ; dr do n't pretend this is just zero hour contracts skewing the figures . 
  you had your chance . 
  it 's the romanians go now . 
   only they are also projecting it internationally , making us seem like nazis and human-rights abusers on the international stage . 
  and literally no one is taking notice . 
  russia has fuck all soft power . 
  it 's their hard power everyone is afraid of . . 
  if the windows are more than 50cm wide , it 's a fancy house . 
  damn , the dutch are accurate with their stones .

   what about just average rich french people they do n't live in france . 
  those do n't look much like castles . . 
  i 'm not convinced of their siege survivability . 
  2/10 , would not buy . 
  the guy beating the war drum above was from ireland . 
  i was n't talking about poland . 
  poland is one of the few who actually does care and does have a reasonably decent military . 
  i was having a dig at ireland . 
  certainly sounds convincing , but i wish he 's source at least some of it . . 
  he 's saying that it was part of the agreement to attack germany at once if germany attacked poland , but [ here is the agreement ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/agreement_of_mutual_assistance_between_the_united_kingdom_and_poland-london_ ( 1939 \\ ) ) and it says nothing of the sort . 
  * shrug * i do n't remember reading anything about what he 's talking about in winston churchill 's ` the second world war ' . . those alleged treaties do n't seem like something he 'd omit . 
  he was pretty forthcoming with how britain was weak and how we did n't live up to what was expected of us in a lot of ways . 
  seems to me that italian bloke was right and the yank guy is operating on hindsight . 
  that 's true , but they 're not helping themselves by not even spending the nato minimum guideline of 2 % of gdp on their military . . why should we help people who are n't even trying to help themselves ? 
  it 's piss poor , imo . 
  greece should just adopt the glorious bitcoin . 
  that way their economy can rise and fall on the whim of nerds . 
   smells like a stereotype . 
  it was a generalization , yes . 
   sometimes it is easy to judge others when you can sit in your calm island with your cup of tea and broadcast your wisdom . 
  that does n't really explain france and germanys stance . 
  they do n't have a moat . 
  this might be the dumbest turn of events ever . 
  norway , you know you ca n't into space . . 
  you 'd think they 'd spend a bit more time becoming militarily significant if it really bothers them that much . 
  yes , he is being sarcastic . 
  we did n't have much of a land army and france had spent all its money on the maginot line at the expense of their regular army . 
  then we dug in for a rematch of ww1 and hitler decided to fight ww2 instead . 
  it was a military blunder for sure , but hindsight is 20/20 .
