  the right wing parties are going to have a field day over iraqis holding up posters of merkel with arabic writing on them . 
  london is ** the worlds ** financial hub , not just europes . 
  new york city coming second . 
  london does not have freedom of movement with the vast majority of the world , and new york city does n't have freedom of movement with anyone . 
  i 'm not convinced . 
  and it 's clear the guy above was just trying to use ridiculous scare tactics . 
  he was n't thinking about bankers needing to stay for 95 days when he made his post . 
  for the vast vast majority of people the 90 day waiver is more than sufficient for business . 
  have you got an erection right now ? 
   travel visa paperwork lol , this is such a ridiculous argument . 
  we will negotiate 90 day visa exemption with all the eu countries just like we currently have with 174 countries world wide . 
  if you think we 'll have visa exemption with bolivia and not denmark you 're out of your fucking mind . 
  also , lol at a fucking dane preaching about unity . 
  tell me , how are your opt outs treating you ? 
  the threats of eu country leaders saying they 'll impose refugees on us is likely having an effect . 
  i do n't think anyone likes being threatened . 
  i do n't like it even if i agree we should be taking in more refugees . 
  fucking being [ dictated to by some austrian chancellor ? ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11837860/austria-threatens-to-scupper-camerons-eu-negotiations-over-migrant-row.html ) ... 
  it 's a ridiculous situation to be in . 
  hell , we fought a war to stop that happening !, 
  ( hon hon hon ), 
  i hazard a guess there 's a fair few of us . 
  if corbyn is still leader by 2020 i 'll be voting tory for the first time . 
  shit , we did n't even make the top 10 ? 
  bag of chips will literally let you finger any bird in sight . 
  ukipers fucking hate the foreign aid budget . 
  they 'd do away with that too if they could . 
  the amount of ` we spend xbn on foreign aid , why ca n't we feed this pensioner ' images that went around facebook before the election , lol . 
  dude , do n't bring up iraq !, 
  we 've got that blood on our hands too . . 
  do the us really do that ? 
  that 's such bullshit . 
  especially when the first thing those countries do with that ` foreign aid ' is buy us military equipment . . 
  i do n't believe we do the same . 
  i just realised that hunger games is a total rip off of battle royale . . 
   good on you brits for having the highest aid spending in europe ( and the us for having the highest spending globally ) , but please realise that it is mainly a factor of your population size 12 % of the eu 's population , 21 % of eu 's foreign aid spending . . 
  ' 10,000 people a year wo n't make a significant difference in house prices you bellends . 
  there 's much bigger factors at play in that regard . . ' although i 'd likely have to word it a bit better . 
  russia are a useful villain in this context . 
  we ca n't politically or morally justify such intervention in syria , so we 're rendered impotent when there 's a clear solution to this mess . 
  support assad and crush the fsa/isis . 
  but russia has no such qualms or hang ups . 
  yesss , we 'll give them more * living space * . . 
  boris can technically become president of the usa already as he was born there . 
  we 'd have about the same amount of power as the snp have in westminster . 
  so , effectively not much . 
  and just like with the snp , the parties of the rusa would work together to make sure we 're rendered impotent . 
  also , in us politics we 'd not really agree with much at all so we 'd be the constant outsiders . 
  the 1,500 number was just thrown out there . 
  it 'd likely be much less , because a kid does n't need 1,500 to live with a parent . 
  eh , i do n't see the point of forcing them back if they make a life here . 
  seems needlessly disruptive for everyone . 
  their employers , their friends , their kids and of course themselves . 
  it 's really not a huge sum . 
  lets say we give each of them 1,500 a month and we agree to 10,000 refugees a year . 
  that 's only 180m quid a year . 
  we can skim that off out 11.4 billion quid foreign aid budget if needs be . 
  i 'm sure an argument can be made that it counts as foreign aid . 
  plus , foreign aid is usually sending money out into the ether . 
  at least with this the money will stay in the uk economy . 
  we 're pretty good at sanctioning benefit claimants now , it should be no problem for us to implement . 
  that 's how germany does it , apparently . 
  they only pay out benefits if the refugee stays where they 're told . 
  it 's what germany does with refugees . . 
  this is a good policy . 
  this is probably the best policy of any eu country at the moment . 
  helping people in need and disincentivizing ( is that even a word ? ), 
  illegal travel to the eu . 
  do you know anything about david miliband ? 
  he 's literally the head of a charity named ` rescue ' . . 
  it 's becoming clearer and clearer that we 're the common sense country of the eu , imo . 
  we must tell them where in the country they can live and be strict about it . 
  we can not let them create ghettos . 
  they 'll understandably want to be around their own people , but we ca n't let it happen . 
  it breeds a weird culture within a culture shitshow . 
  two different and separate culture communities living side by side is not multiculturalism . 
  that 's my only stipulation for all of this . 
  i 'll be writing to my mp to tell him this . . 
  surely the second it was made obvious he was from ghana he should have been arrested , put on a plane , and flown back . 
  lets be honest here , it 's likely robbed . 
   no , but 6,3 % to 9,5 % is catastrophic enough to let any politician loose the next election . 
  a free trade deal ** not ** being reached for the uk and eu is not even worth considering . 
  about as likely as me fucking mila kunis in the next 20 minutes . 
   ` punishing ' you for leaving might actually be something many countries ' leaders might deem necessary . 
  better off out then . 
  sounds like an abusive relationship to me . 
  even if we 're punished in the short term , the long term gain of not being held hostage by hostile partners would be a net positive . 
  fyi , i am not convinced of the ` the eu will punish you ' argument , if i was then i 'd be for leaving the eu . 
   the fact is parliament now has the say on whether we go to war or not . 
  only on ` lend a hand ' interventionist style war , and only through convention . 
  going to war should not be something that needs to go through parliament , because prior experience ( usa during ww2 ) has show us it can lead to impotence when action is needed . 
  you * would * say that . . 
  not really . 
  libya was only going one direction regardless . 
  there was rioting and an insurgency against gadaffi before we got involved . 
  iraq was completely under control and functioning relatively well when we invaded . 
  i do n't really want to leave , because i feel like the eu can be improved on and turned into something a bit more useful . 
  i also do n't think it 's worth taking that estimated 2.2 % economy contraction for a rather unclear gain . 
  i just do n't think it 'll be the end of the world if we do end up leaving like some make out . 
   another analysis by economists at the centre for economic performance ( cep ) , part of the london school of economics , calculated the uk could suffer income falls of between 6.3 % to 9.5 % of gdp , similar to the loss resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008-09 .
