  i 'm not even innocent myself , although now i 'm past my early 20 's it 's a lot less frequent than pretty much every weekend like it used to be . 
  does n't seem like a particularly good idea to me . 
  we have police for that . 
   similar thing happened between humans on air france 447 where there was a recoverable issue , but fixing it became too late because both pilots thought they were in control ( left pilot and third crew member were trying to figure out why they were stalled nose up in a free fall and the right pilot was pulling back on the stick the whole time to get the plane to rise ) . 
  i will never understand how a trained pilot did that . 
  low air speed , losing altitude ... 
  pull up ?!, 
  tragic . 
  that was actually the one i was thinking of when i made that post . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aeroflot_flight_593#description_of_the_accident basically , the kid managed to override the autopilot but only for the aileron control . 
  plane rolled . 
  pilots fought the autopilot all the way into the ground . 
  apparently if they 'd just let go of their steering wheels the autopilot would have sorted it all out . 
  honestly , we do it here too . 
  go to any british high street on friday and saturday night , and you 'll see a toned down version of it . 
  [ here 's a documentary crew following some cops around on a saturday night . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eydyhfmwla ),

  my friend would shit his pants big time if he was on that plane . 
  i think i might as well , and i 'm not even scared of flying . 
   undocumented behaviour of the plane i watch a lot of air crash investigation , and it 's surprising how often that problem comes up in crashes . 
  sometimes it 's undocumented , and other times the pilots just did n't understand the plane had that feature . 
  they 'd play a group game of ` gay chicken ' , leading to them eventually bumming each other while crying . 
  why not just let us make up our own minds about a thread ? 
  why do we need mods telling us how to feel ?

  they might as well be tagging them ` trigger warning ' for all the good it does . 
  the mods on this sub are fucking useless . 
  ah , thanks for the clarification . 
  marginally less funny now . 
  i wonder if the two groups are going to try and out gay each other . 
  lol , mass vandalism as a bi annual tradition and you 're trying to shit on us for a one off riot ? 
  k , m8 . 
  every fucking year , lad . 
  [ new years 2014 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/10546263/only-1067-vehicles-set-ablaze-on-new-years-eve-in-france.html ) [ new years 2015 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30653784 ) [ bastille day 2015 ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/721-cars-torched-france-over-bastille-day-330411 ) ok , it 's not looting . 
  but it 's about as bad , and it happens like clockwork . 
  you getting the ira and strikers mixed up again ? 
   london has a chip on their shoulder that they subsidise the rest of the uk , which is not true [ it 's objectively true .

  i wonder what would happen . 
  would the budget be revised down or would contributions go up ? 
  if the budget is reduced , could it trigger other countries to feel they 're no longer getting their monies worth ? 
  likewise , if the contributions are increased , could it trigger other countries to feel they 're no longer getting their monies worth ? 
  interesting to think about . 
  well that was nice an patronizing . 
  wait a second , let me get this straight . 
  we 're in a situation where the far right group are organizing a gay pride march , and the far left are organizing a protest against the gay pride march . . do dogs walk humans in sweden ? 
  does rain fall from the ground to the sky ? 
  do people wear shoes on their hands , and gloves on their feet ? 
  properly hilarious . 
  i find it incredibly funny that french mod guy just gets downvoted out of habit here on / r/europe now . 
  and he still wo n't give up speaking french first . 
  it 's like the olympics all over again . 
  when you want to be with your bae but you still love allah too . 
   i love it when people stand up for what they believe is right . 
  what 's your opinion of isis ? 
  i mean , if we take what you said to the logical conclusion , 
   people would just check the first two digits of the bar code and avoid anything french asking in the supermarkets replacements for french stuff . 
  ha , that 's so good . 
  and til that apparently the first two numbers of a barcode are origin . 
  but then it 's only 45 % of that 8 % . . 
  they could just as easily be downvoting him for calling france the sick man of europe , or by saying they need a thatcher . 
  i said they need a thatcher above and the comment is toggling from upvoted to downvoted seemingly every minute . 
  the fuck do you even loot from nandos ? 
  raw frozen chicken and some bottles of marinade ? 
  brixton had similar riots in ' 81 . 
  but yeah , it was particularly unusual in how it spread throughout england . 
  he could have been lost . . 
  [ made some enemies with this post . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ejrcy/striking_french_farmers_set_fire_to_200000_of/ctfmr0b?context=1 ) post i replied to is sitting at ~ 80 upvotes , my reply sitting at ~ 1 upvote , the reply to my post is ~ 80 upvotes ... fair to say it was decently controversial . 
   whether pushing each other off the road , barging past social rivals , beating up rival soccer fans , or idolising wealth as the only measure of virtue , brits became more unpleasant to be with . 
  you heard it here first , guys . 
  thatcher is responsible for people being arseholes . 
  just ignore the arseholes in every country worldwide who do n't even know who thatcher is . 
  what a complete load of pish . 
  keep reading . 
  there was another bunch who burned them alive . 
  union heads were instrumental in how it all turned out . 
  if they 'd been willing to allow some jobs to be lost a transition period would have been possible whereby people would gradually lose their jobs over decades rather than one big hit in the 70 's . 
  but the unions could n't see the bigger picture , and in the end they had a lot less power than they realised . 
  you sure that was n't 2011 ? 
  do n't remember any in 2010 , and there has n't been any since 2011 . 
  whereas with france this shit is seemingly a monthly occurrence . 
  west country farmhouse cheddar is the pdo 'd cheddar , and will usually be the best . 
  i do n't have any specific ones i like . 
  i like all cheddar !, 
  well , as long as it 's mature cheddar . 
  it 's not a silly technicality , and i 'm not denying that scotland leaving the uk would be a big deal . 
   i do n't think that makes it a lot better . 
  8 % is a darn sight less than 25 % . 
   and to get back to the topic , thatchers politics definitely are partially responsible for the cultural split between the more social democratic scotland and the `` finance , yay ! '', 
  attitude that seems to be prevalent in london . 
  tony blair and his poorly thought out system of devolution has a bigger part to play . 
  well i 'm sure this conversation will go nowhere quickly with that kind of ridiculous vitriol . 
  i know when to quit while i 'm ahead . 
   if a quarter of your country land mass seems like a silly way to measure public opinion . 
  use population instead , and it becomes a much more reasonable sounding ~ 8 % . 
  coal mining is fucking awful and dangerous work anyway . 
  the less people doing it in the uk the better . 
  if it was still about today the same people who are complaining about thatcher closing the mines would instead be complaining that people have to work down mines .
