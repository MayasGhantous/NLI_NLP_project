  i mean , we 're still getting rain regularly now though . 
  it was raining yesterday morning my way , and i 'm south east england ... and i think it rained the day before too . 
  it 's not strong rain , mind . 
  just spitting . 
  maybe other countries have heavier rains , but less frequently ? 
  or maybe we 're bitching about nothing . 
   ca n't be easy . 
  literally being confronted by a teenage girl saying she wants to have a future in germany and having to say ` no ' to her face . . on live tv . 
  fuck that noise . 
  completely agree , although we 're benefiting ( or at least i am ) from not being able to understand her actual words . 
  it 's possible they sounded insincere . 
  from what i read and saw , though . . she did great . 
  can you imagine dave . 
  his forehead would have been much shinier than normal . 
  that 's like closing your eyes , spinning around and around and then throwing a dart and expecting to get a bullseye . 
  edit : and and and and, 
  seems to me that greece is in a unique position where it can justify completely throwing out its old tax law and starting again from scratch . 
  simplify the whole thing , and therefore make it easier to collect taxes . 
  most countries would give their left arm to be able to do that . 
  forget the swedes , this dane ca n't spell for shit . 
  it 's all blondes to me . 
  mum : ` if greece jumped off a fiscal cliff would you jump off a fiscal cliff ?! ', 
  psh , what do you know about sweden . 
  you 're only from there . 
  i would like to hear more from the [ racist ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3df2up/europe_feels_like_nazi_germany_says_madonna/ct4if0w ) [ yank ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3df2up/europe_feels_like_nazi_germany_says_madonna/ct4j1oe ) who has never visited sweden . 
   why are you so confident that this is n't the first step for blocking much more ? 
  because cameron did n't make it law in 2013 . 
  he did n't make it law because he knew it was unlikely to pass the lords/commons and proper public scrutiny . 
  so he kind of strong armed the isp 's into a compromise . 
  so yeah , i 'm pretty confident this is n't a ` slippery slope ' . 
  psh , is that all ? 
  get on our level . 
  house of commons : 650 house of lords : 786 scottish parliament : 129 welsh assembly : 60 northern irish assembly : 108, 
  23 % is very significant . 
  i wish 23 % of our mp 's supported it . 
  1 + 2 , we 're just going to differ on as it 's opinions . 
  in regards to 3 , i think you 're still confused about what 's actually implemented . 
  there 's no centralized way for the government to block internet sites . 
  the filters are n't centralized . 
  each isp operates its own ` active choice ' filter which is completely in control of the isp . 
  if the government want to block a website , they have to go to through the courts ( as shown in the wiki page you posted ) . . 
  so the government ca n't accidentally block a site unless they accidentally go through the courts and accidentally win a court order . . 
  so you just subscribe to every snp talking point wholesale then ? 
  so we 've got ` oil is mine !, 
  ' , and we 've got ` trident bad ! ' . . 
  what 's your opinion on food banks ? 
  might as well go 3 for 3 !, 
  reddit will be unbearable for most of next year for everyone but americans . 
  and also americans . 
  should be interesting though . 
  everyone on reddit hates hilary , and everyone on reddit hates all republicans . 
  no idea who they 're going to champion this time . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/15/us-northsea-oil-decommissioning-iduskcn0pp02920150715 it 's only going to happen more as the year progresses . 
  north sea oil is expensive . 
  middle eastern oil is not . 
  it was barely mentioned on reddit . 
  1 ) i do n't think paying for the site or not matters at all morally . 
  if you offer it for free , you 're as bad as someone offering it for cash . 
  2 ) i do n't think the whole ` oh , we only link to where you can find the files , we do n't host the actual files ! ', 
  is a morally valid argument . 
  the end result is the same . 
  people get other peoples ip for free . 
  3 ) pretty sure all those accidental ones are due to the internet watch foundation , which has nothing to do with the government . 
  it 's a charity that isp 's set up to help the public report and block criminal content . 
  in particular , child porn . 
  imgur gets blocked quite often probably because someone at the charity fucked up a wildcard or something when blocking . 
  i would n't say we 're run better than germany . 
  france , italy , spain ? 
  yep . 
  most of the ones to the east ? 
  yep , probably . 
  nordics ? 
  mmmm , probably not . 
  so yeah , maybe top 5 ? 
   the same is also true in reverse , most british people know far more about us politics than they do about continental european politics i blame reddit and the 2012 presidential campaign for me knowing so much about that shitshow . 
  not strictly true . 
  if you go by border you get something like 90 % of it . 
  it 's a burden now anyway , and will be for a while . 
  the iran deal is going to make sure of that . 
  can we join ? 
  because i do n't really understand what more is at stake , and i 've never really heard much of a convincing argument for why i should be able to download movies for free that people spent their time , imagination and money making . 
  i 'm with a smaller isp , so those are n't blocked for me . 
  looks like they 're mostly ( all ? ), 
  copyright violating sites . 
  hardly scandalous . 
  should we be able to steel peoples intellectual property ? 
  i mean , i do it because it 's easy but i wo n't complain if i 'm stopped somehow . 
  i should really be paying for more of the movies i watch . 
  the strangest thing is ... 
  most of the mums on there are n't even old . 
  this is n't something that 's going to die out . 
  a lot of them seem to be 18-25 . 
  it 's just insecurity from what i can tell . 
  this google search , and the results it gives show why david cameron was so eager to at least be seen to be doing something about it . 
  https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=dh+porn+site:mumsnet.com seriously , read some of the threads . 
  dh = darling husband, 
  dat insecure mother vote . 
  that 's a valuable vote . 
  https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=dh+porn+site:mumsnet.com dh = darling husband, 
  i 'd hazard a guess that if there is , genocide related crimes are exempt .
