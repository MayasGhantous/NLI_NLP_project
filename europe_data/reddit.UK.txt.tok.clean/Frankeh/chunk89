  see [ this post i made ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dcsdc/eu_law_that_could_make_uk_internet_porn_filters/ct44s65 ) i 'll just be repeating myself otherwise . 
  it was this one . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auschwitz:_the_nazis_and_%27the_final_solution%27 but i also recommend : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_nazis:_a_warning_from_history which has some great interviews with people of that era . 
  they confront a woman who ratted out some jews who were later killed . 
  it 's pretty chilling . 
  and of course : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_world_at_war the episode ` genocide ' is relevant , but the whole documentary series is easily the best that 'll ever be produced . 
  has interviews with people who were high ranking officials in germany/uk/russia / america during ww2 . . 
  okay , here 's a current run down of what 's actually going on since you seem to be completely misinformed . 
  * these filters have existed with uk isp 's for years . 
  they were opt-in . 
  * the government said ` look , you 4 big isp 's need to make your filters opt-out . 
  if you do n't do it , we 'll pass a law to make you do it . 
  * isp 's said , do n't be ridiculous . 
  we 'll do ` active choice ' so all new customers see that it 's an option and can enable it if they like . 
  * the government agreed to this compromise . 
  does not pass any kind of legislation . 
  * the isp 's set their in-house-completely-nothing-to-do-with-the-government filters to pop up when someone uses their new internet connection for the first time . 
  [ it looks something like this . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ybyymxz.jpg ) varies depending on isp . 
  * the current figures for people who enabled the filters are : bt = 5 % , sky = 8 % , virgin media = 4 % and talktalk = 36 % . 
  so please , tell me how a slippery slope argument can be applied to this without being ridiculous . 
  i 'm all ears . 
  the government do n't control the filter , though . 
  each isp maintains its own independent filter system . 
  and it 's only 4 isps , but there 's at least a hundred isp 's in the uk . 
  maybe it 's not a non-story , but it 's not worth the huge fuss people are making of it . 
  oh , also it 's not a law . 
  there 's no law on the books requiring isp 's to implement a filter . 
  heh , i was listening to a documentary that was maybe 5-10 years old last night and it had an interview with him . 
  he did n't seem to think he 'd done anything wrong . 
  he claimed he was actually helping shut up holocaust deniers by speaking about his time at auschwitz . 
  i believe they also found him not guilty at the time ? 
  seems weird to re-try him so long after it happened . 
  if the evidence was n't strong enough in the 50 's you 'd think it 'd be even less strong now . 
  it 's just yank websites dae 1984 circlejerking for the most part . 
  no one seems to even realise that there 's no law requiring these filters . 
  even less seem to realise that turning them off is simply a single click during installation , and they 're not applied to existing accounts . . 
  such a ridiculous non-story . 
   meaning they have nothing to do with this law . 
  fyi , it 's not even a law . 
  ** so ** much misinformation being peddled about this . 
  ` slippery slope ' can be used as an argument against pretty much anything you do n't like . . 
   the opt-out is a problem and you know it . 
  no it is n't . 
  does n't apply to old accounts . 
  on new accounts when you first try to use the internet you 're asked ` do you want to child filter on/off ' with ` on ' being highlighted as the default . 
  it 's such a non-issue . 
  my heart weeps for them . . 
  there 's a thread on / r/worldnews about this at the moment and it 's boiled my piss good and proper . 
  everyone in there has no idea what they 're talking about . 
  pretty sure most european countries have a ruling party that generally get ~ 40 % of the vote . 
   as of right now their 9 % in the uk is worth exactly 0 , because they are not part of the ruling party or coalition . 
  yeah , that 's not how democracy works . 
  by that logic labour have no say either , but that 's clearly not the case . 
  now we 're talking !, 
   the uk needs to have a military presence in calais . 
  lol . 
   i actually feel sorry for germany as most of them wants to stay there . 
  [ phew !, 
  ] ( http://38.media.tumblr.com/0b316f1e5a59cd5847e1ae1fdf09edc0/tumblr_mvnwki0c3d1qajc4eo1_r1_250.gif ), 
  they currently have an ~ 9 % say in the uk . 
  they 're not going to have anywhere close to that in the eu . 
  they 'd have a < 1 % say in the eu . 
  and they 'd be voicing their opinions against a group of countries who are a lot less like them than the uk countries are . 
  pr is n't the be all and end all . 
  yeah , for reasons that are beyond my comprehension . 
  hate westminster for not being democratic and not representing the views of the scottish people , fawn over brussels . 
  some quality doublethink going on there . . worth remembering that scotland actually has one ukip mep . 
  scots are more pro eu than the english . 
  they 're not particularly pro eu compared to countries outside of the uk . 
  first thing that came to mind , haha . 
   a london-based pr firm, 
  the eu 's end game is to have member states in the ez though . 
  we 'd need to increase the esa 's budget 10 fold . 
  yeah , that was not a noble thing we did . . we armed far right groups and they ended up shooting a bunch of peaceful communist protesters . 
  when you 're relying on faith in something , that 's not a good position to be in . . 
  mate , i think you 're forgetting that he is gods chosen one . . 
  bloody hollande has logged onto reddit again after a few too many glasses of wine . 
   i think i just realised something : if this is a legitimate request then doesn ; ' t this just signal that germany is admitting it is totally inept when it comes to managing these kinds of crises and they feel they need the brits to do it instead ? 
  germany are n't offering britain a place in the ecb . . we were just tongue in cheek saying that if we 're expected to pay then we should get some say in the eurozone . 
  in this hypothetical would n't greece just default on all its debt ? 
  i have a hard time believing we would lend them any substantial amount of money . 
  we might give them a token amount out of our foreign aid budget . 
  a hundred million or so , maybe . 
  nowhere near enough to make a difference . 
  i 'd be all for it . 
  it would just be a hilarious situation having us help decide the direction of the euro when we have a competing currency of our own . 
  you know your party sucks shit when it has a ` communist faction ' . . 
  we have an extremely comprehensive and lenient student loan system . 
  it does n't matter how shit poor you are , you can always get the loans to pay for your uni education . 
  for all intents and purposes it operates as an expiring graduate tax on earnings over # 21k . 
  at least know what you 're talking about if you 're going to talk about it . 
   now we got an agreement with all eu countrys and the eu is not just a `` benefical club '' but stands also for an idea and ideals . 
  ideals which the uk seems not to share . 
  you realise this deal for greece is concentrated horse shite , right ? 
  if this is the ` ideals ' of the eu , then they 're pretty shitty ideals . 
  mate , this wo n't make us hate greece . 
  this 'll make us hate the eu . 
  maybe this is why cameron was so anti juncker ? 
  i would laugh so hard if we got representation in the ecb .
