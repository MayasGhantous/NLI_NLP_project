  the thread was not an offer by the mods to do a running commentary , and if anyone wanted to do that then they had the opportunity in the form of a comment . 
  on big events it 's much better to keep all the discussion in one thread , imo . 
  the french/english shit is just annoying in a megathread . 
  there 's a time and a place for that shit . 
  just result in the front page being filled up with loads of the same articles , and 15 disjointed comment threads . 
  this is much better . 
  get over it . 
  you ca n't move comments . 
  you ca n't sticky non self posts . 
  what were they supposed to do ... 
  how was deleting that thread censorship ? 
  they created this megathread in its place . 
  i feel like it 's just a matter of time before we seen another big attack . 
  we 're overdue . 
  assange knows he can just make bullshit up and his groupies will lap it up . 
  self serving arsehole , imo . 
  this should be required reading for anyone that still think assange is in the right : http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/media/2012/09/legal-mythology-extradition-julian-assange, 
  read this title as ` gulls ' 3 times in a row now . 
  i believe we have that policy in the uk . 
  those two who ran over and then stabbed lee rigby to death both ended up living , for example . 
  you ca n't carry a pellet gun for protection in the uk . 
  is n't the point of a terrorist attack to claim it ? 
  this should surprise no one . 
  but seriously , what is wrong with juncker ? 
  i thought all countries give vat back when you leave ? 
  i 've never actually bothered with it , but i thought it was a thing they do . 
  literally who cares . 
  do n't like it , do n't buy them . 
  plus it 's only the flavour . . 
  there 's no meat in them . 
   seriously , this is n't sustainable and there 's nothing we can do about it while we 're members of the european union . 
  yes there is . 
  we can close our boarders to non-eu immigrants . 
  they 're generally from cultures least like our own anyway , so it makes sense . 
  the eu is a scapegoat . 
  we have an army , though . 
  * shrug *, 
  i 'd like to know this too . 
  a beating is allowed . 
  the courts said so by finding him not guilty . 
  i mean , you can continue to argue this but it 'll just make you look incredibly stupid . 
  my daily mail link beats your daily mail link . . http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2544671/cleared-20-minutes-businessman-defended-property-fuel-burglars-fighting-against-fence-post.html, 
  you 're 24 years old and you do n't chuck your parents a few quid as a thank you ? 
  i am aware that they 're not in the eu , but / u/really _ likes_nutella said ` europe ' not ` the eu ' . 
  you can have whatever you like in your house for whatever reason you want . 
  https://www.gov.uk/buying-carrying-knives law only cares about carrying on your person , or wielding . 
  er , you 're allowed knives , machetes , bats , etc. . you just ca n't carry them around with you . 
  if someone breaks into your house in the uk you 're allowed to use appropriate force . 
  if needs be , this includes any weapon you have . 
  first time buyer penalty . 
  my mortgage is 4.49 % so it makes sense to just overpay into my mortgage . 
  no where offers a safe 4.49 % on savings any more . 
  been thinking about getting a stocks and shares isa . 
  nations gran . 
  yeah , the eu is the only thing stopping war in europe . 
  she 's not opposing the government . 
  david cameron does n't want to leave the eu . 
  he will be campaigning to stay come the referendum . 
  do n't care . 
  still counts . 
  and i 'd argue it 's not true anyway . 
  kebabs and indian food do n't feature heavily in our fine dining . 
   yeah but they have to drive everywhere so do i. 
  there 's no public transport worth a damn near me . 
  a beating is allowed pretty much worldwide . 
  shooting dead is a little more restricted , but even in the uk it can be legal if it was absolutely needed . 
  actually , scrap the salmon and ham . 
  just the barrel of bulmers . 
  actually , scrap the feast . 
  where am i ? 
  where are my shoes ? 
  whose kitchen is this ? 
  am i in a b&q ? 
  if it 's only one item each , it has to be this . 
  improves any meal . 
  fact . 
  we 're at least in the top 5 in europe when it comes to cuisine . 
  i 'll never understand why we get shat on so hard still . 
  rationing fucked our reputation , but that was years ago . 
  that 's a sore subject . 
  there 's a nice middle ground between no penalty and death . 
  i think we should pursue that , lol . 
  i do n't even live in london and my 1 bed flat is 350 square feet : / it 's fucking shite . 
  whenever i see houses in america i 'm always so jealous . 
  their living rooms alone are generally about 2 times the area of my entire flat . . [ check this bullshit . . ] ( http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/percapitaft22.gif ), 
  think about how long this has been going on , though . . 
  no flair lad . 
  near worthing . 
  i work in brighton , but the cost of living in brighton is absurd for what it is and the wages are pretty low . 
  i guess that 's what a < 1 hour train link to london does to a city : / i remember when i moved to brighton 7 years ago and laughed that studio flats were going for # 50k . . now they 're # 110k . . brighton just is n't worth it anymore . 
  i managed to pick up a 1 bed near worthing for ~ # 90k last year . 
  same place would be nearer # 150k in a shit bit of brighton . 
  not worth it just to save a 20 minute commute . 
  mortgage : # 385 service charge for flat : # 70 council tax : # 70 mobile phone : # 37.5 ( ca n't wait to get out of this in january ) broadband/landline : # 35 electricity : # 30 water : # 20 car insurance : # 35 car tax : # 12 contents insurance : # 3 life insurance : # 10 mortgage overpayment : # 100 food : # 140 petrol : # 90 leaves me with # 602.5 to spunk up the wall , which i always manage to do just fine . 
  never have anything to show for it , lol . 
  i 'm a single male , living on my own . 
  i am so surprised it 's even possible now the internet exists . . 
  again , neither of those things warrant the death penalty . 
  yes . 
  you ca n't shoot someone over some material goods , obviously .
