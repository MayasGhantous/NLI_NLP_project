except its not that black and white , the nhs and nuclear power are just two policies of those parties . 
  choosing is hard when both parties have policies you like and dislike . 
  hey i was going to say germany feels like home when i visited !, 
  berlin just felt right like that for some reason , i ca n't put my finger on it . 
  i do n't really see how this post is supposed to be debated . 
  if they were born in england then they are english though . 
  any emergency really , any situation which needs a quick intervention . 
  starting a war with russia would also be seen as aggression . 
  i was there the other day !, 
  it was quite funny watching tourists go up to the steps to sit on them and a loud speaker would say ` this is a protected site please move away from the building ' , progressively getting louder and more irate until people realised it was speaking to them . 
  i 'm pretty sure every student since the university price hike have noticed the effects of the conservatives being in power . 
  well done for adding literally nothing to the conversation and judging 80 different comments in about 5 words . 
  i kinda like a lot of the skyscrapers in london . 
  any particular reason why you think they are disgusting ? 
  is that thing really a paint roller ? 
  your right in some ways , the world wars are seen in a patriotic light , but patriotic in a sense of focusing on the british stiff upper lip . 
  we are proud of the fact that people ` got on with it ' , that is to say they focused on the matter at hand and dealt with the hardships that came with it with dignity and respect . 
  anyway , i think it is unfair to compare just the german vs. british outlook on previous wars , as we have had such starkly contrasting results . 
  what would be more interesting is to compare each country in europe 's outlook on the world wars and how their role in them has formed their outlooks . 
  it is obvious that a difference in outlook between britain and germany would be different , i 'm even surprised its not more different than it is . 
  uh , no . 
  and i never said it did . 
  i learnt about the dresden bombings in history , perhaps you should n't jump to conclusions on our education system . 
  the article is more about the british outlook to war and the supposed patriotic heroism that is tied to it . 
  yea , i do n't agree with this at all . 
  the way i have been brought up and learnt about the war , it focused more on the horrors that come out of it . 
  the terrible conditions of the trenches , the effects of shell shock and the devastation of years of bombing on our cities . 
  i have always seen the memorials as a sombre reminder of how much we lost . 
  yes , most villages do have memorials , why would n't you when half the men in those villages died ? 
  they are usually full of engravings of names , dates and ages . 
  i feel almost insulted by this article . 
  furthermore he talks about the imperial war museums lack of foreign influences , and yet on [ the guardians own review ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2014/jul/10/imperial-war-museum-reopens-100-years-of-warfare-in-pictures ) of the exhibition we see the following : * a puppet of margaret thatcher . 
  * a ** japanese ** sword handed over during their surrender . 
  * a flag used in the normandy invasion * a section of a weapon barrel built by a ** canadian ** for hussain . 
  * a ** palestinian ** press vehicle . 
  * a ** german ** radar defence dish from wwii . 
  * a ** japanese ** zero fighter plane . 
  if this is an accurate cross section of the exhibition then i do n't see how he can fault them on lack of foreign influence . 
  christ , your anal . 
  no i would n't , because there is a very small english population on reddit . 
  the other day every other post on / r/all was about howard . 
  did you see the post match thread on / r/soccer ? 
  it was full of ` well done america ' / ` you played your heart out ' etcetera , 99 % of the comments were positive . 
  anyway , mocking others is a central tenant of football , every team mocks the other team . 
  i think americans sometimes take things too literally . 
  haha yea i know right he 's like a brick wall or something , best goalie in the world definitely !, 
  add ` tim howard ' to the list and your set to go !, 
  [ jack in the green on may day !,

  thanks . 
  can you provide a source for the 9 % figure please ? 
  no it 's because one reporter is trying to make it news . 
  english fans expected this to happen , just not with 2 losses . 
  eh , it 's kinda funny i suppose but i do n't think this is really the right sub for it . 
  i get quite frustrated when people on here interpret cameron or the media 's opinion as something that applies to what the general public want . 
  it feels like there is a big disconnect between the media and the public opinion . 
  i get the impression that most media outlets really want to push the whole anti-eu agenda and there is never really a debate around it . 
  i 'm not trying to justify anything , i am as thoroughly opposed to the thought of british secret trials as i am american . 
  all i am saying is that you should be more readily sceptical about your own governments propensity to disregard your own constitution and basic human rights . 
  i 'm also failing to understand the point your making with guantanamo ; that facility should n't count in this argument because you do n't believe it should still be up and running ? 
  that does n't stop it from contuining to exist . 
  do you really doubt that the us do n't hold these trials ? 
  and why does guantanamo not count ? 
  it is even worse than a secret trial because those people get no trial at all . 
  if the us government is content on using secret torture building in europe regardless of it being unconstitutional then do you really think it would be much of a stretch to have secret trials ? 
  what firm moral ground does russia stand on right now ? 
  i do n't think the world is black and white , but at present russia is definitely looking a dark shade of grey . 
  you only hear about the xenophobia , you do n't hear about what it 's really like , which is mostly the exact opposite . 
  also coming from an american that 's kind of hypocritical , no ? 
  never heard of this radio show before but i love this guys deadpan delivery . 
  and at the same time there was an article with less upvotes about the uk having the second best education in the eu . 
  i was more referring to education in school and how we were never taught what kind of fallout occurred during british rule . 
  the bbc are quite good at making documentaries on subjects like this , and although they are educational , i would n't count it as straight up education since it is not mandatory and the majority of the population will probably never have seen it . 
  i never knew about the genetic weakness to alcohol in indians , it 's quite an interesting facet . 
  although you could also say that everybody has a genetically strong addiction to meth or heroin , but it does n't cause a ( comparatively ) large problem as drugs do in the indian reservations . 
  i also wonder , is the geographical disadvantage because the europeans annexed all of the more profitable land , or is it because that 's where the indians chose to settle ? 
  i think the term is [ tracts of land ] ( http://youtu.be/g3yipc91quk?t=1m24s ) , rather than tracks . 
  i think he is trying to say that your readiness to admit your shortcomings in respect to reconciliation is an important part of the process that simply does n't exist in russia, 
  i do n't think we have done enough to reconcile our past , and the education of our former colonies is quite poor . 
  in fact we learned more about native americans than anything else . 
  which brings me to ask whether the us has done enough to reconcile with native americans ? 
  from what i have seen through the media they pretty much live in ghettos . 
  i do n't know , most people here seem to be pretty happy with how we done : http://www.reddit.com/r/britishsuccess/comments/258lxy/we_beat_germany_and_france_in_the_eurovision/, 
  forgive me but is n't it a bit hypocritical of the us defence secretary to lecture europeans on spending inefficiency ? 
  the secretary also seems to be looking at europe with rose tinted glasses . 
  yes , 300 million may be enough but the money is n't exactly the issue here , it 's that nobody can agree when to use hard and soft power . 
  personally i think that the individual nations of the eu are too much at odds to form an effective joint force . 
  it would take an invasion to unify us in any meaningful way without american support . 
  american criticism of europe 's nato forces is well founded , but i think they sometimes fail to understand how hard it is to come to an agreement when each country has a different outlook , personal interest and general public to appease . 
  the american 's style of military spending is quite an extreme example though , and not one we can afford or want to mirror in europe . 
  i think some middle ground is needed were we are more self-sufficient . 
  was n't the new us rail gun made in europe ? 
  it 's stupid really , how would they have ever enforced it ? 
  glad they are changing it , now we just need reduced fines for illegally copied material . 
  can we cease with the low effort picture posts ? 
  this is nothing but uninformative drivel . 
  or ... revolution ? 
  she is like ... 50 % boob ... 
  is it true that your papers do n't like to cover scandals or affairs and such ? 
  perhaps it is more because of the cultural difference in reporting ?
