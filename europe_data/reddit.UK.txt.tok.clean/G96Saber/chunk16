  we are , do n't you know ? 
  most of us have never picked up a gun in our lives but longbow genes run so deep within us our arrows can melt steel beams . 
   cheer up , at least you still have your white van  it 's even got an england flag blazoned on it . 
  inga-land !, 
  as demostravius said , it 's definitely the straight bananas . 
  on a serious note , as i see my country crumble into a grey , faceless , mire how could i not be unhappy ? 
  better to be poor and content than rich and miserable . 
  we 'll have at least a solar system by then , if not a galaxy , so do n't worry . 
  the two countries were in personal union for a time with spain holding the upper hand . 
  i do n't drink , so ... 
  we are an island . 
  hehe . 
  colonialism . 
  [ much like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z4m4lnjxky ), 
   i think there 's a real cultural problem in the uk i think this is a cultural problem for most of the world . 
  as an anarchism ; it 's only the main language of a small percentage of the population . 
  i know ; calling the english language ` american ' was too obvious . 
  besides , i have plenty to say about belgium . 
   and england should actually be part of the usa , because why else would they be speaking american ? 
  an entirely different situation and you know it . 
  britain is the mother country of the united states , on the other hand , these islands are , in a continent that groups people in large part by languages , swedish . 
   swedish speaking part of finland . 
  kek . 
  that sounds a lot like sweden . 
  if they were finnish they 'd speak finnish . 
  well when you say ` secularism ' ... 
  the united kingdom and france , for instance , gave entirely different conceptions of what secularism is . 
   are you actually serious ? 
  i 'm sorry if you really think that teenages or people in their early 20s actually care about `` dying for our land '' or some ridiculous notion like that then i 'm afraid you 'll be disappointed one day ( well probably not since there wo n't be a chance to test that theory again ) . 
  i never said anything about sacrificing their lives ; only that , underneath a shallow hyper-liberal facade , the united kingdom is a quite conservative country and thus very patriotic . 
  it is rarely expressed in any grand gestures , and much of the elite of the united kingdom hate it , but it is nonetheless there . 
  that would fit your narrative perfectly , ` euro federalist ' . 
  anyway , i somewhat disagree . 
  british teenagers are relatively nationalistic in comparison to those who are in their mid-twenties , especially those who live away from large cities . 
  cities i doubt you 've ever stepped out of . 
  of course , people tend to become more patriotic as they age , adding another layer of complexity . 
   let 's get the irish on board , we already have plenty of their descendants in canada anyway . 
  ` let 's just forget cromwell , eh chaps ? ', 
  it would be possible , i suppose . 
  that would make it : the united kingdom of great britain , northern ireland , ireland , canada , australia and new zealand . 
  a population of 131 million and a gdp of 6.3 trillion in us dollars . 
  ireland would be the awkward one , having a difficult relationship with the uk and being republicans . 
  the united kingdom of great britain , northern ireland , canada , australia and new zealand . 
  ... and anyone else we can lure to the ~ ~ master ~ ~ nation . 
  or you can go with a different combination . 
  no matter what , it would always be really long . 
   we form cato : commonwealth anglosphere treaty org . 
  if you 're going that far , why not just federalise ? 
  we could have the longest country name in the world . 
   looking at how passive and effete western europe has been with the migrant situation and economic crisis , i 'm not sure everyone in yurop is even willing to fight and die for their own country . 
  britain , france and the netherlands , certainly . 
  everywhere else ... 
   it 's just stupid to restart mandatory army service in 2015 ... b-but ... 
  it 's the current year !, 
  all of them . 
  as esuuvo said , just because he used the phrase ` beg the question ' does n't mean he committed a fallacy . 
  in context , he literally - and by literally i mean ** literally ** - meant ` this raises the question ' . 
  do n't be absurd . 
  if ` western containment ' did occur if the 19th century , it is obvious that some evidence ** must be given to support that claim ** . 
  that 's all he 's asking . 
  those comments though . 
  soon mayhaps he #ll be occupied by a throne , then we 'll see ... ** que evil laughter **, 
   diversity breathes life into stale models by involving people with a variety of backgrounds who 's experience has taught them to approach problems in a unique fashion from ` locals ' . 
  it really is n't a complicated idea . 
  have you never considered how laughable that sounds ? 
  how to make a moderated ethnic nationalism appeal to left-wingers , the news article . 
  that 's an impressive display of mental gymnastics you have there , have you ever thought about going to the olympics ? 
  good : nothing notable . 
  bad : the eu still exists . 
   that 's not true . 
  look at the us and canada . 
  immigration has been a net positive for north america . 
  right then , all those ghetto 's are just our imagination . 
  what . 
  why y no like my will to power ? 
   yah , well , regardless of our opinion about homogenity vs diversity , it is a done deal now . 
  world changed , people mixed , got ta live with it . 
  not really . 
  anything can be reversed , given the will . 
  has anyone ever weathered that particular humiliation ? 
  ... n-no , why would you think that ? 
  ^ quick , ^ he 's ^ noticed ^ shut ^ it ^ down , ^ shut ^ it ^ down !, 
   second , following this war , the republic succesfully invaded england and placed it under dutch control to stand united against france that 's some nice revisionism you 've got there . 
  there was no invasion . 
  a minor dutch king , because he was protestant and related to the house of stewart , was _ invited _ to become king of england . 
  moreover , this king could do little to actually influence england itself ; he has some nominal control , but real power already rested with parliament . 
  france had also been england 's enemy for hundreds of years , regardless of the dutch . 
   no , they are historic examples . 
  it makes absolutely no fucking sense to compare undeveloped pre-industrial economies quickly catching up on a new technological standard to sustained growth of information based economies . 
  victorian london was not , by its time , ` underdeveloped ' . 
  nor was imperial japan _ that _ underdeveloped either . 
   you should go and get some fresh air . 
  i 'm wrong because i 'm wrong . 
  right then . 
   comprehensive analysis there . 
  it 's almost as if you do n't want ` diversity ' to be a factor in economic growth . 
  it 's almost as if it so-bloody-obviously is n't that even the concept is absolutely laughable . 
  they make complete sense . 
  they 're examples of homogeneous countries whose economies could not , realistically , grow at a faster rate than they were . 
   cultural diversity can certainly have a positive impact on today 's england prove it .
