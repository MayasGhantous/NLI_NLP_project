  the eu is just a concept like any other . 
  it 's not some transcendent god whose purpose is static and unchanging . 
  it can be whatever those in the eu wish it to be . 
  if we got any more germanic the world would explode . 
  you wo n't see them if you do n't look for them , which many wo n't . 
  transgender women are n't actually women . 
  basically , he was not a nazi . 
  i like the sound of switzerland more and more . 
  saying that , erecting a statue of che guevara is ridiculous . 
  that was my immediate response . 
  just that it 's more ridiculous . 
  england has plenty : scrooge , the great escape , the lion in winter , love actually , a christmas carol , a child 's christmas in wales , the lion the witch and the wardrobe , the polar express , on the twelfth day and so on and so forth . 
  britain really likes christmas . 
  schooling today is geared toward girls , as boys tend to be more hyperactive when young and thus require hard discipline mixed with the odd practical activity . 
  neither of which are now part of normal schooling . 
   okay , some random stranger needs a new kidney and you 're a perfect match . 
  you do n't want to give him one of your kidneys and suffer all the impairments having a single kidney will bring ? 
  well , too bad , your vanity is not worth more than a life . 
  how does that sound ? 
  a fallacious analogy . 
  firstly , a ` random stranger ' could potentially get a kidney from a different source ; a baby , on the other hand , has no other way to live but inside a womb . 
  secondly , and more importantly , the stranger most likely did nothing to cause him to require a new kidney . 
  a pregnant woman , with the exception of rape , however ... 
  would be so much the americans would be joining the ensuing coalition from across the atlantic ocean . 
  is so dank . 
  is weed all you care about ? 
  hungary . 
  oh , how noble , fair lady . 
  i do n't give a fuck . 
  your vanity is not worth more than a life . 
  the coal exchange building is far better . 
  more in keeping with a meaningful aesthetic . 
   i said that a human 's ownership of their own body and the right to defend itself is worth more , and i have no issue with that claim . 
  if a human wires up to someone 's body , leeches their energy and threatens their health and well-being , a person should not even have to justify removing them by any means necessary . 
  if you insist on treating fetus as a human , then killing it would be in self-defense . 
  a poor analogy ; there is no other way for the baby to exist but in the womb . 
  it is not comparable to someone being wired up to someone else . 
  i would 've thought that an obvious absurdity , but clearly i was wrong . 
   but i think that debate is irrelevant to the matter that is primarily an issue of basic personal liberty - which is what having absolute authority over your body is . 
  ` personal liberty ' , for one , does not override the right to life . 
  when those two concepts conflict , life comes before liberty . 
  even so , ` having absolute authority over your body ' is ** nothing ** to do with personal liberty . 
  we , in the west , have personal liberty . 
  yet , we do not have ` absolute authority ' over our bodies . 
  this is because , for all intents and purposes , ** we are our bodies ** . 
  ergo , our bodies must pay tax , obey laws and fulfill responsibilities . 
  therefore , we do not have ` absolute authority ' over our bodies . 
   industrialization industrialisation began in the late 18th century , not the 19th century . 
  england led in terms of industry until about wwii , when germany 's and usa 's huge population began to show its worth . 
  there were probably more development points in england alone than the entirety of the austro-hungarian empire . 
  i laugh at your silly empire . 
   i 'll write this up quickly since your comment quite clearly violates this subreddit 's rules and will probably be removed soon . 
  no it does n't ; your brain is as soft as your skin is thin . 
   in the case of abortion , a pregnant woman is protecting her own bodily autonomy . 
  no she is n't . 
  to become pregnant , one must , usually consensually , participate in sex . 
  thus , the woman ** caused ** that foetus/child to be there . 
  it is , therefore , her responsibility . 
   they can either go somewhere where abortions are legal , or if they ca n't , they will either pay some doctor ( who might not even be a real doctor ) to perform the abortion , or they 'll self-abort . 
  or they 'll ... not abort . 
  and in the modern world pregnancy is n't that dangerous . 
  the older generation of his family were , but they settled down . 
  they still have many of the cultural trappings , of course . 
   british people are just uncultured when leaving their rainy island . 
  these are just the british people you see . 
  and imagine . 
  they are not representative of the british nation . 
   they are rarely aware of actual day-to-day reality of women who have to live with unwanted pregnancies and choices/options available to them in societies where abortion is illegal , or possible consequences of said choices . 
  most people are also ` rarely aware of the day-to-day reality ' of rape or murder . 
  should we , therefore , only allow those who 've been involved in murder or rape a voice ? 
  no , you tool . 
  just because someone has gone through an experience does n't make them the arbiter of the issues surrounding it . 
   at the end of the day , regardless of when life or sentience begins , an adult human being should arguably have absolute authority over their own body . 
  even if you take life at conception as granted , even if you see abortion as killing another defenseless human - the women should be given that right nonetheless , because that other human is a guest at best , and an invader at worst . 
  at the end of the day , it would only be one more notch on an already very long list of existing exceptions where killing another human is considered ethically acceptable . 
  you just said killing a defenseless child is morally acceptable . 
  no it is not ; a life is worth more than a woman 's vanity , shame or career . 
  the life of the woman is not , usually , in danger just by being pregnant . 
  therefore , no one is putting the foetus ` over ' anything . 
  austria and denmark 's are pretty good . 
  and france . 
  germany 's lower house is pretty too . 
  hunagary 's is spectacular , as is the netherlands . 
  portugal 's is very grand , and so , surprisingly , is romania 's . 
  serbia has an interesting building . 
  sweden and switzerland have unusual shapes , and are quite attractive . 
  of course , the palace of westminster is as handsome as ever . 
  wales ' ... looks like a giant bus shelter . 
   i think we all know most of the english pop songs that get played way too much on most european radio stations this time of year that is because glorious english culture is best culture !, 
  shudder in awe as you bow to glorious british cultural imperialism !, 
  ... ahem . 
  the angels sing . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw38pghpxik ) unfortunately , some smelly ` celtic ' people are singing it in that video . 
  alas , it 'll do . 
  you called ? 
  why is n't everything free !, 
  oh horrible is capitalism !, 
  i bet he wears a top hat . 
  true . 
  i suppose calling them the ` ottomans ' is a little silly , since by that time the empire was little more than turkey .
