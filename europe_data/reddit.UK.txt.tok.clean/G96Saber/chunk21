  social trust has all but disappeared . 
  that would be great ; ` the midlands ' is something almost out-of-culture , whilst ` mercia ' ( or the ` duchy of mercia ' ) has history and pageantry to its name . 
  saying that , i would do far more to the kingdom of england than just revive the name mercia . 
  do not speak of wessex , southerner !, 
  glorious mercia , whose capital shall be birminghamstan , will rule from the humber to those silly britons in south wales !, 
  offa shall rise again !, 
  a most pertinent suggestion , dear hungarian gentleman of unknown name . 
  it is , without a doubt , a most spectacular happening to see such sophisticated men of honour contemplate their vast intellects without intrusion from mere sophists such as myself . 
  and it was one of my best . 
  it was very good for school solidarity . 
  thine fedora is most unpleasant . 
   the dark age is called dark for a reason mega kek ; the ` dark ages ' are named , or were called , so because of the relatively sparse litter of literature from the period . 
  moreover , that is n't even relevant to the subject . 
  the church functioned as social glue in the dark ages too ; sometimes it even replaced other cultural or proto-national identities . 
  ` is turkey turning into japan ? ', 
  nottinghamshire here : never seen one either . 
   religion had an oppressive role , not social . 
  the kind of social interaction you want did n't exists when the church was more influential , especially those between men and women . 
  what the * fuck * ? 
  your fedora must be larger than a small moon ; as watrenu said , even rabid anti-theists generally admit the positive role of the church as a glue of social cohesion , and a place to gather . 
  the dislikes are laughable . 
  what you 've said is entirely reasonable , though you seem to be playing devil 's advocate , but : atheist brigade , assemble !, 
  the philosopher 's stone is mine , okay ? 
  the amount of self-congratulatory shit in that speech could fill an ocean , if it were manifest in the real world . 
  actually read the article . 
  actually read the article . 
  actually read the article . 
  actually read the article . 
  the independent being its usual clickbait self . 
  which will in turn exacerbate the decline of social trust . 
  damn , i must have been half-asleep when i wrote this . 
  huh , people like that still exist ? 
  damn , we have n't tried hard enough ... 
  going to have to go back there and fix it ... edited for spelling mistake . 
  on a england-stronk joke . 
  bollocks . 
  there 's some interesting stuff to which i could not help but nod my head ... and some things made me reread . 
  then reread again . 
   most europeans ca n't stand the holier-than-thou attitude of the brits anyways . 
  they can piss off alright . 
  a german pontificating about moralising britons ? 
  you certainly are the kek-master general . 
  yeah , the guardian and the independent hate the eu so much ... 
   insane opt outs they 're great opt-outs , actually . 
  just not for federalists . 
   within the boundaries of the myth , suicide plot makes no sense . 
  it 's never properly explained why father-figure ca n't forgive everything without sacrifice . 
  i 'm willing to suspend disbelief , but the story has to be internally coherent . 
  the sky-guy is supposed to be wise and good , right ? 
  yet he insists on this superfluous sacrifice . 
  at least put a post-death dialogue in there explaining the decision or something . 
  2/10 , do not buy this book . 
  good stories do not require such obvious storytelling . 
  it 's fairly simple ; a small amount of theological education and even a fool could understand , ` why father-figure ca n't forgive everything without sacrifice ' . 
  answer : he did . 
  jesus is god , and god jesus . 
  i 'll let the downvotes understand that the title , ` top european court upholds france 's headscarf ban ' is liable to attract every new atheist , pseudo-intellectual wanker in r/europe . 
   selfless heroism requires that an actual good deed be performed . 
  `` saving people 's souls '' is not a good deed , it 's bullshit , makes no difference . 
  if some guy in asia lights himself on fire on my behalf , should i thank him ? 
  oh for god 's sake , ** within the boundaries of the myth ** , it is clearly an act of selfless heroism . 
  just like , say , someone sacrificing themselves to the personification of the force would be in a star wars story . 
  it does n't matter that the force does n't , in real life , exist . 
  are you being pedantic on purpose ? 
  or are you usually entirely unthinking ? 
  i know it is . 
  it 's still petty . 
  just makes france petty . 
  you 're being incoherent . 
  first you assert that as a christian you have nothing limiting your behaviour , then you contradict that previous statement with this , ` and the behaviour guidlines are mostly about being good ' . 
  therefore , if to be a christian is to attempt to be good , you are necessarily limiting your behaviour . 
  there are things you should n't wear , and things you should n't eat , and things you should n't say and do . 
  yes it is . 
   well then it 's the story of some crazy person who walked willingly to his death 2000 years ago . 
  it 's called suicide , and we should n't encourage it in the presence of our nation 's youth . 
  that 's just the behaviour of an uncultured peasant . 
  in the story , notwithstanding its truth , a man sacrifices himself for the good of other people . 
  it is an act of selfless heroism ; or are you against the concept ? 
  irrelevant ; myths have themes regardless as to whether people believe in them or not . 
  whether you ` believe the story ' is irrelevant ; homer 's * iliad * is about glory and fate , regardless as to whether one believed the events of the iliad actually occurred . 
  ... well this seems petty . 
   there is not one rule i have to follow in terms of freedom because im a christian . 
  i can do whatever i want , whenever i want and dress what i choose . 
  then you 're not a christian . 
  well done . 
  because it 's the symbol of a man sacrificing for the welfare of others ? 
  since liberal conceptions of freedom have existed - a fair few hundred years now - people have recognised that some things necessarily need to be permissible , and some things do not , for a society as a whole to be ` free ' ( being , ` at liberty ' ) . 
  these things being : - a consistent rule of law . 
  - a free press . 
  - a democratic political system holding the majority of political power . 
  - a cultural consensus affirming all of the above . 
  these points , which began in england , then spread to america , and were later expanded into europe by france , are ** all that are necessary for a society to be free ** . 
  no where in that list does it say , `` and we 'll let people do what the fuck they want , smoke week everyday ! '', 
  if poland did not agree to this treaty , they would still be following eu law . 
  you 're joking right ? 
  these violations prove nothing ... 
  except your self-righteousness . 
  you 're fucking joking , right ? 
  cyprus is n't even that large , nor is it economically auspicious . 
  few young people would ever move to cyprus .
