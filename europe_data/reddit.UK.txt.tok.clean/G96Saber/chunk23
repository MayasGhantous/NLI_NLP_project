   nah i think in general the french public will know this is n't not because of migrants or the usual reasons the fn give , they know it 's because of dickheads who refuse to acclimatise to western values ... who just happen to often be migrants . 
  the national front are civic nationalists , so that would be : people who have grown up in france . 
  oh but that 's so horrible , is it not !, 
  they 're discriminating against people not from france !, 
  how utterly problematic !, 
  because they have some common fucking sense . 
  ireland and the netherlands are as similar as louis van gaul and kate moss . 
  despite that fact , there is no reason why both can not feel sympathy and ` stand together ' with france . 
  it 's a pity it sometimes sods off . 
   yeah , filthy commoner should know his place and kneel before his betters !, 
  no wonder the yanks laugh at you . 
  better to kneel at a symbol of the nation than to kneel at the feet of money . 
  we should do that . 
  it would be the great lest act of trolling ever conceived . 
  we should do that . 
  it would be the greatest act of trolling ever achieved . 
  if only they worked properly . 
  perhaps . 
  though it would give canada , australia and new zealand a new drive ; canada and australia are big enough to have ambitions , but are n't big enough to be a significant player on the world stage . 
  united kingdom + canada + australia + new zealand = a high hdi country with 120 million people , the third largest economy in the world by gdp ( 3.6 trillion ) and a large military ( which could easily be expanded ) . 
  more important , i think , would be the emotional effect of a union . 
  it would create a ` third way ' between america and europe and suddenly , countries that had never really been powerful before would be thrumming with it . 
  if only i knew ~ ~ aboot ~ ~ about canada 's , australia 's and new zealand 's military , then i could actually picture that ... 
  then all those loans would n't have gone toward tanks ... 
  that sounds cool too . 
  combine and enlarge a commonwealth military and blow shit up ? 
  we 've been pushing for political change for fucking years . 
  europe does n't want to listen . 
  the threats , evidently , go both ways . 
   cameron is welcome to sit on the sidelines and watch further integration take place . 
  and laugh at their stupidity . 
  a. . . strong article . 
  it rings true though . 
  because of ... 
  the normans did not consider themselves french , nor would they have thanked you for implying they were . 
  france has , briefly , been conquered by england ; the treaty of troyes set up henry v as heir to the throne of france and , legally speaking , henry vi was king of england and france for a short time . 
  if henry v did n't die of illness , history would 've been different . 
  because wilhelm was socially retarded , therefore making him effeminate would make sense , considering the era . 
  ` why wo n't he stick to the narrative ? ', 
  ` glorious european project must be completed for the greater good ! ', 
  happiness is not like any other metric of humanity ; moreso than any other factor , many - if not most - treasure it and wish for it to a greater extent than anything else . 
  they are therefore more likely to delude themselves regarding their own happiness . 
  because the lies most told are to oneself . 
  it 's better than being french . 
  somehow , i doubt the veracity of happiness scales . 
  culturally , russia has had a massive impact upon europe ; politically , through its example of absolute monarchy and through communism , which both served as positive and negative examples in various times . 
  there is , also , a number of great cultural works - like war and peace - which come from russia . 
  but the culture ** of the country itself ** is , west of the urals , sufficiently different to be on the fringe . 
  no more so than britain is though . 
  east of the urals , on the other hand , it 's a different civilisation entirely . 
  because it 's so damn funny . 
  pigs are sloppy seconds . 
  of course , oxford , cambridge , york , norwich , bath , durham and chester ( and the list could go on and on ) are obviously not the spiritual heart of britain . 
  though edinburgh and aberdeen are also quite pleasant . 
  well , it 's true . 
  if it makes you feel any better , half the male population was also far more interested in playing fifa than in gordon brown/ed miliband and david cameron . 
  of course i 've spoken to the ` general population ' . 
  i live in society , not as a hermit . 
  i think it 's pretty clear that as people become more mature - having a house , a family , etc - they become more interested in politics . 
  since this usually happens at about thirty ... 
  if you want young people to become interested in politics , then a curriculum change will be necessary . 
  politics , philosophy and economics will have to be taught . 
  i went to a fine school . 
  it was above average in gcse results and served a primarily middle-class area . 
  few people cared ; girls especially were more interested in celebrity culture . 
  going into space ? 
   young people can and are enthused and informed about politics at 15/16 . 
  dear lord they 're not . 
  a few years ago i was in school , in a decently middle-class area , and the vast majority of the student population would struggle to name the leaders of major parties , nevermind have a nuanced view of politics . 
  if anything , the voting age should be raised . 
  whatever information you have on your phone is likely of no interest to the government ; arbitrarily hacking it would be a waste of resources . 
  it would be of interest to a amateur hacker . 
  hard drug users = addicts . 
  ** muh freedoms **, 
   are they ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  well you must have the brainpower of a fucking carrot then , of course they fucking are . 
  when you 'll commit crimes to satisfy an addition , that 's makes you threat to public safety . 
  i know right , all attempts to incentivise good behaviour should stop !, 
  ah , people on horses ride about my home town constantly , it 's pleasant ... and on worse days , when the wind is blowing the right way , we can smell a pig farm . 
  so because the united kingdom does n't acquiesce to the european union 's stupidity all the actual power we have suddenly does n't exist . 
  do n't dream to much , spaniard . 
  the again , there are only so many dreams one can dream ... 
  the ~ ~ empire ~ ~ united kingdom will let you in , little ( ish ) canada . 
   i agree that the eu would be weaker with no uk in it . 
  but the uk would lose more by leaving . 
  losing some economic power in the short term is irrelevant when leaving the eu is in our long term interests . 
  did you just link to wikipedia ? 
  pfft . 
  though it 's strange , your list does n't even correspond to wikipedia . 
   the uk went full russia and had a crackdown on all things irish for the 700 years preceding irish independence so it is a little understandable that we trust the eu more than the uk . 
  that 's diminishing what russia did in its march to the atlantic . 
  it 's so horrible !, 
  how pathetic is your existence that you make it a life mission to stop the consumption of porn . 
  these sexually repressed people need therapy , not an opinion . 
  you sound pretty hysterical yourself . 
   not that i am addicted to it , but i seriously could not imagine my life with 0 porn consumption . 
  do those `` anti porn campaigners '' even relieve themselves or do they just look at their genitals in disgust ? 
  i think you 're addicted to it . 
  aye , that 's why gangs of new york was as it was .
