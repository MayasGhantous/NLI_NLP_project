i 'm sure that they 're just on holiday . 
  it 's a little known fact that russian tanks are so advanced that they 're sentient and entitled to leave . 
  the parody excuse does n't really wash . 
  most of the threads have a great deal of far right sentiment . 
  sure , some of it 's just teenagers trying to be edgy , it 's the nature of 4chan , but you ca n't write it all off as such . 
  yes , / pol / is the `` politically incorrect '' board on 4chan , and is famous for being outright nazi . 
  [ here 's a post today ] ( http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/37027811/pol-my-fathers-father-is-a-slavic-ukrainian-and ) from a ukrainian worried he 's not allowed in the aryan ` master race ' . 
  / r/unitedkingdom is fairly left wing . 
  / r/ukpolitics was just a subset of the / r/uk folks , so was also left wing . 
  then / pol / decided it was too left wing and basically took it over . 
  now / r/ukpolitics is a right wing circlejerk whilst / r/uk is a left wing one . 
  it means `` all that '' . 
  indeed . 
  not that i love the neoliberal nwo , but it 's better than psycho religious extremism or fascism .

  incoming `` rebel '' forces in 3 ... 2 ... 
  `` i might have asked for this . '', 
  i think that conspiracy theories operate according to the same psychological principles as strong religious belief . 
  same . 
  if my options are the west controlled by the illuminati and majestic 12 or the islamic state or soviet union mk2 under putin , where can i sign up for my illuminati membership ? 
  now hold on there , he 's no st. tesla * hallowed be his name * . 
  `` poverty increases in the uk ! '', 
  - russian government 's official mouthpiece . 
  not of course that that detracts from the point that our government is an absolute shitfest run by an old boy 's club , but the criticism coming out of russia of all places is * highly * ironic . 
  because the no campaign is completely devoid of abusive assholes , right ? 
  robert the bruce  william wallace . 
  that 's the annoying thing about the government rhetoric . 
  the imf told them , tune down the austerity and enact a stimulus package . 
  the government told them to piss off ... and then tuned down austerity ( remember how we were supposed to be running at a surplus before the next parliament ? ), 
  and enacted a stimulus package ( quantitative easing ) . 
  and now they 're saying the imf was totally wrong to tell them to do exactly what they ended up doing but under a different name ( `` austerity '' ) . 
  but hey that 's how politics works . 
  say something enough times and people believe it . 
  also the `` do i have to go on my knees ? '', 
  was clearly a joke , but that does n't stop the torygraph . 
  yes . 
  although the beginning is borrowed from mechwarrior and i googled to get the ascii hammer and sickle, 
  that 'd be pretty sweet .

  i doubt he gave a flying fuck about the local population . 
  the risk was the political ramifications and alienating russia from europe . 
  it 's still , strategically , paid off for him . 
  but in the long run i suspect russia will hurt a lot from the flight of foreign investment - it 's become clear that this is n't a good place to do business . 
  good find . 
  i was n't aware of that one . 
  well apparently it is below average . 
  i thought it was high as they put it up from 17.5 which it had been for ages . 
  that 's because it 's income tax , which is low for low earners , not overall tax . 
  we have lots of non-progressive taxes like vat which make the cost of living extortionate . 
  that 's quite misleading as it only covers * income tax * . 
  income tax for low earners in the uk is very low ( but up to 45 % on high earners ) , but our other tax rates are very high . 
  20 % vat on consumer goods , fuel duty . 
  a much more informative map would show the [ gni per capital ppp ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gnp.pcap.pp.cd ) , which basically gives you some idea of how far your average wage actually * goes * in said country . 
  using this you can see that , for example , although you 'll pay much less income tax in the uk , you 'll have much lower purchasing power than you would in norway or france , which both have much higher income tax . 
  i think that 's a problem in most countries . 
  certainly in the uk we 've pissed a lot of money up against a wall by invading other countries when we could/should have been fixing issues like our decaying , out of date infrastructure . 
  i was expecting it to be a bunch of pictures of smiling spies , like a school yearbook . 
  i thought `` wow they must be really bad at their jobs ! '', 
  i had sex with your mum . 
  ** top secret ** . 
  technically it 's a [ patronymic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patronymic#russian ) rather than a middle name . 
  it tells you his father 's name was also vladimir . 
  i think his infamy is riding pretty high at the moment . 
  another annexed province will probably give the other great powers a containment caucus belli . 
  as fast as your mum . 
  britain and france 's only corridor for invasion was across the maginot line . 
  large scale naval invasion was not possible due to lack of preperation and lack of arial superiority so britain and france would have to have fought across german defensive lines , fighting superior german leaders and equipment in less than say the 2 months that poland would have held out minus soviet invasion . 
  with armies not trained or equipped for fast advances . 
  see the problem ? 
  and no i do n't think poland would have held out longer . 
  much as this subreddit has a hardon for the ww2 polish army , they were even less well equipped than the french and fighting a 3 front war against germany ( north , west and south ) . 
  without fast intervention by armies not capable of fast intervention , poland was fucked . 
  that 's not to say that it did n't get the short end of the political stick , but i seriously doubt that things would have gone much differently if we had n't had a naive pacifist in charge . 
  and yet the largest army , the french , still fell before germany when outmaneuvered .
