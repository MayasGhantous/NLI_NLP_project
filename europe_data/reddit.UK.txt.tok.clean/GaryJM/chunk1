op , how come you post questions several times a day but never post any follow-up comments ? 
  me personally ? 
  none . 
  [ it 's been big news here in the uk . 
  the current top story on bbc news is about donald trump 's apparent reluctance to condemn white supremacist groups . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-40919181 ), 
  how unique do you mean ? 
  for example , * tam o ' shanter * is a famous poem about a man who is on his way home from a night of drinking and comes across a haunted church . 
  it 's a very scottish story but i 've no doubt that other places have similar tales . 
  i saw princess anne go past in a car once . 
  [ this diagram shows how the dutch people have been replaced by machines . 
  ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k5tcamd_gj8/uf2ffvqxtwi/aaaaaaaaaa0/n5vuthb-hbs/s1600/polder.jpg ), 
  might be worth mentioning to op that `` rape farms '' are farms that grow * brassica napus * ( the name * rape * comes from the latin word for * turnip * ) since americans often use the name * canola * instead and i would n't want him to get the wrong idea about english agriculture !, 
  though apparently the island was decontaminated in the late 80 's by spraying 280 tonnes of formaldehyde over it and then removing the topsoil . 
  i wear dr marten boots except for when it 's really hot , which has n't happened yet this year . 
  i have n't noticed other people wearing new balance shoes . 
  [ charles rennie mackintosh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_rennie_mackintosh ) is so well-regarded that he 's on the clydesdale bank # 100 note and [ christopher wren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christopher_wren ) used to be on the bank of england # 50 note . 
  near me , there are lots of fruit farms that employ immigrants from eu countries to work over the summer and i do n't imagine you need fantastic english skills to be able to pick strawberries . 
  right you - ootside . 
  the ones i 've had have been absolutely delicious but you do worry that you 're going to have a heart attack afterwards . 
  i live on scotland 's east coast and the pizzas from fish-and-chip shops here are deep-fried but not battered , though still not exactly a healthy food . 
  no , like , pizzas coated in batter and deep-fried . 
  like battered fish . 
  it was used for testing the effects of anthrax as a weapon . 
  rain , battered pizzas , buckfast tonic wine , football , sectarianism , friendliness , ice cream wars , the patter , rab c nesbitt , still game , taggart , charles rennie macintosh , that equestrian statue of the duke of wellington ... 
  usa . 
  of the six top stories on bbc news right now , three are about the uk , two are about the usa and one is about kenya . 
  macbeth 's stepson was king lulach the simple-minded . 
  he did not last long on the throne ... 
  no , you 're right and the person who wrote `` the correct spelling is colours '' is wrong . 
  there are some situations where using one particular kind of english is important and chatting on mapporn is n't one of them . 
  [ if you 'd like to see an actual example of `` spelling nationalism ''  ( https://np.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/4zecjq/is_this_true/d6voz0d )  harbor * this is an american website , meant for americans . 
  just because foreigners visit does n't mean you should n't learn to spell correctly . 
   but i really love scottish how do you say `` cheers , big man ! '', 
  in german ? 
  coffee . 
  surely that 's nothing to do with the supposed `` neutrality '' of american english and everything to do with the fact that the us has sixty times as many people which means that people are far more likely to hear american accents than scottish ones ? 
  is n't that just a tautology ? 
  the accent that you 're most familiar with is the best one because it 's the one you 're most familiar with ? 
  to me , general american is harder to understand than standard scottish english but that 's not an argument for the latter being some sort of international standard of comprehensibility . 
  what can i say ? 
  we thought we were a functional liberal democracy but it turns out people will obey things they see written on the side of a bus . 
  nah , i voted that we stay in the eu . 
   europe and the uk * triggered . 
  `` if your country can have a national meme ( or trend ) wich [ sic ] one ? '', 
  what sort of trends did you have in mind ? 
  could you give an example of a national meme ? 
   21 \u00b0 , and that 's about as hot as it gets sounds like a nice , sensible climate to me . 
  you ca n't spell * united states of america * without * ate sofa . 
  you also ca n't spell * slovenia * without * oven . 
  it 's perfidious pays de galles , is n't it ? 
  yeah - call me crazy but i prefer to go into lakes when they are * not * frozen . 
  you ca n't spell * slovenia * without * love . 
  there 's a tradition here of having a ( very brief ) swim in the river on new years day , so 14 c water is nothing  i would n't advise doing this if you 're used to the adriatic though . 
  oof , too hot for me  the hottest it 's ever been here in only 29 c. of course , new jersey is a lot further south than scotland . 
  trenton is on the same latitude as madrid , whereas i 'm on the same latitude as sitka , alaska . 
  i do n't know what counts as `` a lot '' but the suicide rate among men is higher in scotland than in the rest of the uk . 
  [ here 's where i live , on the east coast of scotland . 
  ] ( http://files.stv.tv/imagebase/300/650x366/300673-dundee-broughty-ferry.jpg ) the average summer high is 19 c ( 66f ) and the water is 14 c ( 57 f ) . 
  the city put on lifeguards during the summer and mark out an area that 's safe to swim in . 
  yes , the use of `` national '' seems confusing here . 
  is it possible for you to link to a copy of the form you are filling in ? 
  italian citizens are eu citizens but i do n't think that 's what the form is asking you . 
  i think it 's asking you about where you are * resident * - that is , where do you live . 
  i 've only ever lived in places where the washing machine was in the kitchen . 
  perfidious \u00c9cosse ? 
  some countries do n't have tea-making facilities in their hotel rooms . 
  my education was similar to what / u/stamford16 described except when i got to age 14 i had to choose 8 subjects to study at standard grade level . 
  it was mandatory to take maths and english , so that takes up two of your `` choices '' . 
  then i had to choose a language ( i chose german ) , a physical science ( chemistry ) , a social science ( geography ) and an art ( music ) and then you had two free choices - i took computer science and physics . 
  i could have chosen history as either my social science ( instead of geography ) or one of my free choices , but i did n't , so my study of history ended at age 14 . 
  how so ? 
  that 's all that i can remember and i 'm sure i must have studied other things but it 's also true that the time i spent studying history was very little , compared to other subjects . 
  i never took any history classes after the age of 14 and i never sat any history exams . 
  i have to admit that i did n't learn about the magna carta or winston churchill either . 
  at primary school we learned about life in the uk during ww2 - rationing and bombing and evacuation and so on - but little about the war itself . 
  at secondary school i only did history for the first two years and all i remember learning about were the scottish wars of independence . 
  the american war of independence . 
  then , when americans ask on / r/askuk what we learned about it in school , i would n't have to disappoint them by saying `` err , nothing '' . 
  ah , i was just going by what was on wikipedia and it said that the * r\u00e9gions d'outre-mer * ( martinique , guadeloupe , etc. ), 
  were part of france and the * collectivit\u00e9s d'outre-mer * ( saint-martin , saint-barth\u00e9lemy , etc. ), 
  were french territories but not part of france . 
  there 's also the opposite of big clive - [ eev blog , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/eevblog ) which is a very excitable australian man taking apart electronic devices . 
  that seems strangely harsh  english just calls those `` orphans '' . 
  english used to have the word * whoreson * but it seems to have fallen out of use . 
  i do n't watch a lot of classic films myself but the british film institute compiled a list of the 100 best-ever british films and the top 10 feature quite a few : the third man ( 1949 ) , brief encounter ( 1945 ) , the 39 steps ( 1935 ) , great expectations ( 1946 ) , kind hearts and coronets ( 1949 ) and the red shoes ( 1948 ) . 
   uk ( jersey island when i was young , do n't really remember it ) i 'm afraid that if you 've been to jersey then you have n't actually been to the uk . 
  it 's the equivalent of a * collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer * - british , but not part of the uk . 
  when i was in orlando it was for a family holiday and we mostly went to big tourist attractions like disney world , universal studios , etc. 
  visiting these places was enjoyable but there was a certain predictability to the whole experience . 
  not that that 's a failing ; i 'm sure people do n't go to these places with the intention of being shocked . 
  a lot of work goes in to making your experience there as undisturbed as possible . 
  by contrast , paris is a city with all the varied experiences one can find in a city . 
  going on the * it 's a small world * ride at disney world was fun but not exciting and being swarmed by postcard salesmen at the eiffel tower was exciting but not fun . 
  i do n't ( i did n't list visiting england in the post i made ) but i know people who do . 
  my cousin recently flew from scotland to england and called that `` going abroad '' . 
  three - france , usa and malta . 
  they were all so different that i could n't say that i liked one more than another . 
  paris was exciting , orlando was fun and mellie\u0127a was relaxing . 
  i do n't know for certain but there are around 3.2 million people in the uk who are citizens of other eu countries and i ca n't imagine that none of those people have children or are disabled or care for a disabled person or are on a low income or any of the other situations that would lead to a person being in receipt of benefits .
