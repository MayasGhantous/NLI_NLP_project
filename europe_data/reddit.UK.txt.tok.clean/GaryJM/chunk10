  prescription medicines are provided free by nhs scotland . 
  nothing to do with the bird , apparently . 
  it 's a form of the name robert . 
  police in england and wales are controlled by the home office , which is a department of the british government . 
  this is equivalent to something being federal in the usa , except that the uk is n't a federation so we 'd just call it the national level . 
  police in scotland and northern ireland are controlled by those countries respective governments . 
  this is n't `` local government '' here as that refers to a level of government below that ( ie city level ) . 
  it 's roughly equivalent to state level in the usa . 
  healthcare in scotland is mainly provided by our public health service , called nhs scotland . 
  it provides all types of healthcare to all scottish residents and is almost entirely free at the point of use . 
  i think it 's a great system . 
  i 'm not sure how to answer the question about taxes and funding . 
  i can tell you that the scottish government 's budget for healthcare in 2017 to 2018 works out at # 2487 per person . 
  i have n't heard of that being used as a first name but it 's a common surname which does indeed come from the name of the colour . 
  aye , but the name jack is n't related to the other senses of the word jack ; it 's thought to be a derivative of the name john . 
  whereas the name willow really is just the noun * willow * used as a name . 
  from a list of the most popular baby names in england and wales , we have : poppy , lily , grace , ruby , daisy , holly , jasmine , willow , ivy , amber , summer , rose , violet and faith . 
  for the list of boys names , i think only mason would qualify , though there are a few that happen to be homonyms of common words - jack , ben , ken , etc. 
   mari - berry did you know there 's a british tv presenter called mary berry ? 
  i 've never experienced an earthquake . 
  it 's considered polite to call countries by the name they wish to be known as and the official name of ireland in english is just `` ireland '' . 
  i left school in 1998 and we never really studied scots either , just a few burns poems . 
  i 'm not sure if scots is dying out or not . 
  it 's a very difficult thing to study . 
  the last census asked a question about scots language skills but warns people to be extremely careful interpreting the results , since they seem to be almost nonsensical . 
  the issue seems to be that the people who speak scots the most do n't perceive themselves as speaking scots , they consider the way they speak to be just their dialect of english . 
  whereas people who switch between scots and scottish english tend to know when they 're speaking scots . 
  i 'd definitely agree that there 's no written standard for scots . 
  i 've seen comments online like [ this one ] ( https://i.redd.it/3p1ekhpi1pty.png ) where i understand it fine but if i was writing it , i would spell it almost completely differently . 
  it used to be a different letter . 
  in practice , no . 
  however there are some names that should be spelt with a \u021c but use a * z * instead , such as dalziel ( / di\u02d0\u02c8\u025bl / ) and menzies ( / m\u026a\u014b\u1d7bz / ) . 
  these can be very unintuitive pronunciations for people outwith scotland . 
   i 'm hoping for a country with temperatures of 21 * c & up if possible i think that 's * just * possible . 
  malta 's average october temperature is 21 \u00b0 c , though i do n't know what their couchsurfing scene is like . 
  we learned [ scottish standard english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_english ) at school . 
  this is n't a dialect from any particular region though , just a formal register . 
  my school had a scripture union club , which i think was one lunchtime a week for people who wanted to chat about the bible . 
  there were only a handful of kids that went and you were considered pretty weird if you did . 
  according to scottish legend , a monastery was founded here in the 8th century to house the relics of st andrew . 
  the site of the monastery eventually grew into the town of st andrew 's . 
  [ list of oldest buildings in scotland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_buildings_in_scotland ) should be a good place to start . 
  no problem !, 
  oh , i forgot to mention our famous [ city wall ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i7fjfbwfhge/maxresdefault.jpg ) - not quite as big as it used to be , i 'm afraid . 
  [ where i live , large supermarkets really can open all day every day . 
  ] ( https://www.tesco.com/store-locator/uk/?bid=2389 ), 
  the oldest building in scotland is the [ knap of howar , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/knapofhowarinsun.jpg/1200px-knapofhowarinsun.jpg ) which is a neolithic farmstead around 5700 years old . 
  the oldest building in my city is a [ church tower ] ( http://www.thesteeplechurch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/steeple-tower.jpg ) that was built around 1480 . 
   quite a few supermarkets are 24/6 now 24/7 in my neck of the woods . 
  what comes between fear and sex ? 
  i 'm guessing this is the set-up for a joke about how the german word * vier * sounds like the english word * fear ? 
  yes . 
  according to my dictionary , this joke does n't work very well in german because you use * gerberei * for * tanning * ( in the sense of tanning hides ) and * br\u00e4unung * for * tanning * ( in the sense of sun-tanning skin ) . 
  i would guess that they have a similar tradition of leatherworking as the rest of europe . 
  which law would this fall under ? 
   as internal division i mean either cultural , ethnic , religious , economic inequalities etc. 
  differences in your country , which are significant enough to be named/to be an issue , even if it 's local . 
  it seems almost too obvious to point out but a majority of people here in scotland ( according to the 2011 census ) consider themselves to be scottish but not british . 
   whales not sure if typo or you 're going all-in on the bestiality jokes ... 
  the organisation that regulates broadcasting in the uk did a study on offensive language . 
  religious language such as `` jesus christ ! '', 
  or `` god damn ! '', 
  was generally considered to be inoffensive compared to any other type of offensive language . 
  there were some religious insults that were found to be offensive - fenian , papist , prod , etc. 
  - but many people did n't even recognise those . 
  there 's nothing in english comparable to * porco dio * or other blasphemous terms . 
  the most offensive terms here are usually to do with sex , body parts and race . 
  christ on a bike !, 
   irish people tend to have a very dry , witty , sarcastic sense of humour aye , we 've all seen * mrs brown 's boys *  edit : dara \u00d3 briain and dylan moran and ed byrne are really who i think of when i picture irish comedians and they definitely have a lovely way with the old sarcasm . 
  really ? 
  according to the times :  nhs hospitals face a mounting staff crisis because half of nurses are due to retire within ten years , research shows . 
  the nursing profession is heading for a `` perfect storm '' of an ageing workforce , rising demand , changes in student funding and the impact of brexit on recruitment , the royal college of nursing said . 
  figures compiled by the union show that 50 per cent of nurses are aged 45 or over and eligible for early retirement within ten years -- compared with a ten years ago . 
  foreign nurses make up 40 per cent of new entrants to the nursing and midwifery council register , with most from the european economic area , prompting fears that supply may dry up after brexit . 
  the government wanted more people to go into nursing so they offered financial support for student nurses . 
  we do n't really have majors in the same way as american universities but , according to the body in charge of university admissions here , the most popular courses in 2014 were : - nursing : 238,000 applications - psychology : 106,000 - law : 103,000 - design studies : 97,000 - pre-clinical medicine : 85,000 - computer science : 77,000 - management : 71,000 - sport and exercise : 67,000 - business : 66,000 - social work : 64,000, 
  what , bournemouth to cherbourg or something ? 
  germany has lots of different sources of names for it mostly due to different countries calling it by the name of different germanic peoples . 
  some countries might call it `` the land of the alamanni '' and others might call it `` the land of the saxons '' and so on . 
  mostly , the names for germany come from : - the old high german * diutisc , * as in deutschland or tyskland . 
  - the latin * germania , * as in germany or an ghearm\u00e1in . 
  - the name of the alamanni tribe , as in allemagne or yr almaen . 
  - the name of the saxon tribe , as in saksamaa or saksa . 
  i would have thought that harold shipman was more infamous than dennis nilsen . 
  i would have said chippies were italian far more often than they were indian or chinese but perhaps that 's just here in scotland ? 
  the government would have you believe that there has n't been a monopolies and mergers comission for 18 years !, 
  they * claim * that it was replaced in 1999 by the competition commission , which was in turn replaced by the competition and markets authority in 2014 . 
  a couple that come to mine are the [ death of diana , princess of wales conspiracy theories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_diana,_princess_of_wales_conspiracy_theories ) and [ david icke 's claims that  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_icke#reptoid_hypothesis )  ... humanity has been genetically manipulated by the babylonian brotherhood , a hybrid race of human -- extraterrestrial reptilians , also known as the illuminati . 
  at the apex of the babylonian brotherhood stands the global elite , and at the top of the global elite are the prison wardens . 
  the goal of the brotherhood , their `` great work of ages '' , is a microchipped population and fascist world government . 
  the brotherhood created and controls the united nations , international monetary fund , round table , council on foreign relations , chatham house , club of rome , royal institute of international affairs , trilateral commission and bilderberg group , as well as the media , military , cia , mossad , science , religion and the internet , with witting or unwitting support from the london school of economics . 
  dirk struan from james clavell 's * tai-pan . 
  several court cases , a general election , probably some other stuff too . 
   2 ) what is the `` tweede kamer '' ? 
  i imagine it would go to a referendum :(, 
   coats of arms in scotland can only belong to one person at a time . 
  there is no single coat of arms which all people of the same name can use -- often miscalled a ` family coat of arms ' . 
  as coats of arms originated in order to identify a person it is clear that it would not be practical if more than one person could use exactly the same design . 
  arms descend to the heir in each generation of the person to whom they were originally granted and other descendants who bear the same surname may apply for a slightly different version of the arms to be recorded in the public register of all arms and bearings in scotland . 
  in scotland the shields of unrelated people with the same surname may bear similarities as the design will be based on the shield of the clan chief , the head of the family .
