   our family that is . 
  i did n't know personal coats of arms existed . 
  here in scotland there 's actually no such thing as a family coat of arms , only personal ones . 
  not sure what 's typical but tonight i 'm listening to german rock music , posting on reddit and writing a backstory for a new rpg character . 
  i have n't noticed an increase in popularity . 
  when i was young ( in the 80s ) , i knew a handful of people who watched it . 
  there was enough interest for there to be a bit of tv coverage but it was still very niche . 
  in the 1990 's and 2000 's the nfl had high hopes that nfl europe would become popular . 
  i remember seeing the adverts on tv for the scottish claymores when they started . 
  it never got that big though and ended up going out of business . 
  these days it 's just more of the same . 
  the bbc show a bit of nfl coverage but it 's still pretty niche and the nfl have put games on in london but it 's a long way from becoming mainstream . 
  i would n't be interested in attending any nfl games . 
  what happened to the * vieille alliance ? 
  * or were you that keen to get rid of england as well ? 
  on the census ? 
  you fill in a form yourself and put down whatever answer you feel is the most correct . 
  i ca n't speak for the rest of europe but where i live it 's virtually unimaginable . 
  the results from the 2011 scottish census were : religion | number : - :| : - : no religion | 1,941,116 church of scotland | 1,717,871 roman catholic | 841,053 not stated | 368,039 other christian | 291,275 islam | 76,737 islam is just tiny compared to other religions , and having no religion is the most common answer of all . 
  no religion is also the fastest-growing group . 
  short of three million muslims moving to scotland at the same time or mohammed appearing above edinburgh castle , i ca n't imagine how islam could become the majority religion here . 
  perhaps if you did n't count the `` no religion '' answers and christianity faded away completely so you had 95 % no religion and 5 % islam , if you counted that as islam being the `` majority religion '' . 
  both  the uk had one tv channel from 1936 , just called `` the bbc '' . 
  a second channel was launched in 1964 , called `` bbc 2 '' and the older channel was renamed to `` bbc 1 '' . 
  people would have bbc 1 as the first channel on their tv , bbc 2 as the second channel and itv ( which launched in 1955 ) as channel 3 . 
  when a new broadcaster launched in 1982 they went with the name `` channel 4 '' , since that was the button people would press on their televisions to switch to that channel . 
  then another broadcaster launched in 1997 and , continuing the tradition , went with `` channel 5 '' for their name . 
  * fifth gear * is channel 5 's answer to * top gear . 
  * `` knockoff '' probably would n't be a million miles away from the truth , 
  deep-fried pizza is fantastic , though it will take a few years off your lifespan . 
  yeah , seems generally accurate . 
  i think that schools in england instituted citizenship lessons and were told to instil `` british values '' in the children , though nobody could agree what these british values were . 
  [ you seem to be the only feckers that like our cuisine .

   everyone loves the scots tho . 
  right back at ya , big man !, 
  there 's a [ `` life in the uk test '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/life_in_the_united_kingdom_test ) that was introduced in 2002 , which you need to pass to become a naturalised citizen . 
  it 's widely seen as an utter joke , full of factual errors and questions that no british-born person would ever need to know the answer to . 
  right , that 's it !, 
  arrrrggghhhh !, 
  no jury in scotland would convict you if you did . 
  we do n't use the term motherland but that would probably be the one we used if we did , since * caledonia * is a feminine name . 
   and have a coke with your single malt . 
  oof , that one made me spit out my irn-bru . 
  i 'd much rather be called guv ` nah than english .

  it 's very hard to say . 
  from my point of view , the benefits of eu membership that we 'll be losing seem very concrete and the possible benefits of not being in the eu seem very nebulous , so overall it seems like a very bad idea . 
  it 's really shaken up my image of the uk ; i voted against scottish independence in 2014 because it seemed like too big a risk , and we did n't seem to be * that * different from the rest of the uk but now i 'm much more open to the idea . 
  any time that education or health care or pretty much any other political issue comes up at westminster , i breath a sigh of relief that it 's the scottish parliament handling those things for me instead . 
  [ here 's the menu for one of popular take-away resturants in my area . 
  ] ( https://www.just-eat.co.uk/restaurants-kohe-noor-dd3/menu ) you can order pizzas , calzones , kebabs , burgers , baked potatoes , fish and chips ( and other chippy fare such as battered black puddings ) , fried chicken , pakoras , tandoori chicken , curries , bhajis , etc. 
  or if you ca n't decide , just order a munchy box , which is a pizza box filled with a selection of different take-away foods . 
  the dictionary defines it as :  a cry used to attract attention , esp in an aggressive way ... but it also has working-class connotations . 
  ca n't speak for other people but i know i do . 
  how old are years 7 and 12 ? 
  we did n't do shakespeare until s3 , at age 14 . 
  not very old ; the oldest one i remember doing was * macbeth , * from around 1606 . 
  we did n't do * the canterbury tales * or * beowulf * or anything like that . 
  they 're still going - their most recent `` protest '' was in the wake of the attack outside the palace of westminster . 
  there were only 300 edl members who turned up and they were out-numbered by counter-protesters . 
  there 's also a scottish defence league . 
  they held a `` demonstration '' in my city that was attended by 50 sdl members and 500 counter-protesters ... they 've not been back since . 
  are you claiming that malta is n't part of the schengen agreement ? 
  is that for local elections ? 
  britain first ran in the 2014 european election and the 2016 london mayoral election , both of which require deposits of # 5,000 and they ran in a house of commons by-election in 2014 which requires a deposit of # 500 . 
  britain first have actually fielded candidates for election . 
  i agree that that 's what loofahs are but loofahs are n't sea sponges , they 're tropical plants - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luffa, 
  you just signal agreement in other ways .

  yes , or at least fairly close . 
  there 's a dialect called highland english that is spoken in the scottish highlands and is more influenced by scottish gaelic than other varieties of english spoken here . 
  non-gaelic-speakers might not have such distinctive phonology but you can still hear the gaelic influence in their syntax , such as infrequent use of `` yes '' and `` no '' ( which gaelic does n't have ) . 
  it 's a similar situation with hiberno-english , which has irish influence even for non-irish-language speakers . 
  scottish gaelic speakers have a recognisable accent when speaking english . 
  common features include de-voicing consonants ( so that * whatever * sounds like * whateffer * ) , using / t\u0361\u0283 / instead of / d\u0361\u0292 / ( so that * just * sounds like * chust * ) and inserting a `` sh '' sound into english `` rst '' clusters . 
  i ca n't find any recordings of people with really strong accents , though you can hear the presenter on [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cusgeuypriw&amp;t=177s ) say `` firsht '' near the beginning of the programme . 
  kitchen . 
  i do n't have a utility room or cellar or basement . 
   i 'm just looking for some travel advice regarding getting around , specifically between london , paris , and amsterdam . 
  should i book train tickets in advance , or are you able to purchase tickets the day of if you want to travel between these cities ? 
  a standard single eurostar ticket from london to paris will cost between # 44 and # 191 based on how early you buy , so while you can buy tickets on the day , you can save a huge amount by booking early . 
  that barack obama , good irish lad so he is .

  yeah ireland , stop dragging the usa into your wars . 
  i 'm glad someone is finally taking / u/hsipak to task over the high level of violence in medieval europe . 
  he 's been trying to weasel out of it for a while now , making excuses about how it was a millennium ago and he was n't even born yet . 
  a likely story !, 
  we all know the truth - he led a crusade against the holy land , which was very naughty indeed . 
  yes , we 're all very jealous of how the usa has never had any revolutions or been involved in any wars and has a thriving indigenous population .
