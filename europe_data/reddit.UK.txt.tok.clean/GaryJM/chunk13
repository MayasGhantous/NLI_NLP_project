  now what will we build our henges out of ? 
  there must be another material we can use ... 
  according to the 2011 census , there were 12,795 buddhists in scotland - 0.2 % of the population . 
  i 'd say that people here rarely think about buddhists but when they do , the generally have a good reputation . 
  build wonders that generate faith points , use those points to purchase missionaries and then send them to rival cities to spread your religion . 
  historical anomalies are sort of our speciality , 
  i have n't heard of anyone suggesting that they join the uk . 
  they 're already british citizens and if they live in the uk for five years ( which they are free to do ) then they get `` full '' eu citizen status and can then take part in the free movement of labour with the rest of the eu . 
  edit : though , i guess that wo n't apply any more :(, 
  to become a crown dependency ? 
  it 's possible , i suppose , but as far as i know there 's very little desire for an independent northern ireland - the people there are generally split between staying part of the uk or joining ireland . 
  from wikipedia :  the isle of man holds neither membership nor associate membership of the european union , and thus did not take part in the 2016 referendum on the uk 's eu membership . 
  protocol 3 of the uk 's act of accession to the treaty of rome included the isle of man within the eu 's customs area , allowing for trade in manx goods without tariffs throughout the eu . 
  however , there are still limitations on the movement of capital and services . 
   eu citizens are entitled to travel and reside , but not work , in the island without restriction . 
  and manx citizens -- without the hereditary qualification outlined above -- are similarly restricted from working in the eu . 
  my sister and her husband have done a couple of american road trips and a guy i used to work celebrated his retirement by hiring an rv and driving the length of route 66 . 
  i do n't know any young people who 've done anything like that though . 
  i ca n't speak for other people in the uk but i 've never done it myself . 
  glasgow ? 
  the uk has ratified the european charter for regional or minority languages with regard to six languages . 
  of those , welsh , irish and scottish gaelic have section iii status ( a higher level of protection ) and scots , ulster scots and cornish have section ii status . 
  i hear scots all the time and never hear any of the others . 
  i 'm afraid they 're serious . 
  i think their argument is that their customers do n't want to receive scottish notes as change , so the businesses do n't want to take them . 
  it 's very frustrating for scottish travellers though . 
  there was even an attempt to pass a law that would mean that anywhere that took bank of england notes would be required to accept scottish notes as well , but nothing came of it . 
   mr mundell , mp for dumfriesshire , clydesdale and tweeddale , said : `` many people , myself included , have tried to pay with scottish banknotes in england , only to find them questioned . 
  this is exasperating . 
  and when a scottish note is refused , that can even leave scots in restaurants or petrol stations unable to pay for what they have bought . '',

  it was voted scotland 's greatest man-made wonder last year , it 's on the [ bank of scotland # 20 note ] ( http://www.britishnotes.co.uk/news_and_info/scottishlatestnews/bos_20_new_b.jpg ) * and * the [ clydesdale bank # 5 note ] ( http://i1.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article5590009.ece/alternates/s615b/clydesdale-bank.jpg ) and it 's a unesco world heritage site , included for both cultural ( `` a masterpiece of creative genius because of its distinctive industrial aesthetic , which is the result of a forthright , unadorned display of its massive , functional structural elements '' ) and historic reasons ( `` an extraordinary and impressive milestone in the evolution of bridge design and construction during the period when railways came to dominate long-distance land travel , innovative in its concept , its use of mild steel , and its enormous scale '' ) . 
  even without a distinctive regional accent you can still pick out the part of the country someone comes from . 
  i do n't have the typical dundonian accent but i still sound unmistakably scottish . 
  yes , in english ( well , my dialect anyway ) * gin * and * djinn * are pronounced the same , as / d\u0292\u026an / . 
  my post was n't very clear - / \u0292 / is the sound from the middle of the word * vision * or from the beginning of the word * j\u00e1 . 
  hmm , i do n't know . 
  i could imagine you might have issues spending one in a shop . 
  yeah , i 'd guess you could call them non-bank of england notes . 
  the notes issued by scottish banks are the same currency - pounds sterling - as the ones issued by the boe . 
  i 'm not sure what the situation is in jersey . 
  other currencies ? 
  please tell me you 're joking . 
  yeah , rbs still do them . 
  they 're pretty rare though . 
  very good !, 
  those are all correct except that the dentist is asking where she 's come from - * come fae ?

  there 's a fascinating page at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_regional_pronunciation that says that the \u27e8 g \u27e9 in * regina * is pronounced as : - / \u0261 / ( as in * gun * ) in classical latin and by slavic , german and danish speakers . 
  - / d\u0292 / ( as in * gin * ) by italian , romanian and english speakers . 
  - / x / ( as in * loch * ) by spanish speakers . 
  - / \u0292 / ( as in * vision * ) by portuguese and french speakers . 
  yeah , in theory we have notes from # 1 to # 100 but , in practice , i almost never see anything other than # 5 , # 10 and # 20 notes . 
  a proposed piece of legislation - called a * bill * - is introduced , either by an mp in the house of commons or by a peer in the house of lords . 
  this is called the `` first reading '' , where the title of the bill is simply read out and the text of it is made available to members of the house . 
  later , a `` second reading '' is done , where the members of the house discuss the bill . 
  a committee of members of the house is formed . 
  the committee consider the bill in detail , proposing and voting on amendments to it . 
  when the committee have finished , they report back to their house and the members there discuss the amended bill . 
  more changes can be made at this stage . 
  once all the changes to the bill have been made , it has its `` third reading '' where it is presented and members vote on whether or not to approve it . 
  if a majority of the members approved the bill then it passes to the other house , where it goes through all the same stages again . 
  once both houses have approved a bill , the monarch gives it `` royal assent '' and it become law - an act of parliament . 
  unlike in the american system , the monarch ca n't veto legislation . 
  well , in theory she can , but she 's not really supposed to . 
  you tend to only see a very small subset of all the notes and you become familiar with those . 
  if you go to another part of the uk then you might have problems spending money you 've brought with you . 
  the only notes i ever see are the # 5 , # 10 and # 20 notes from the three scottish banks and from the bank of england , so that 's only twelve different notes . 
   largest coin : 50 bani : 0.1098 cents . 
  your largest coin is only worth one-tenth of one cent ? 
  yeah , they bought a northern irish bank that had the right to issue notes . 
  [ here 's the danske bank # 20 note . 
  ] ( http://britishnotes.co.uk/news_and_info/irishlatest_news/danske_20__2012.jpg ), 
  we 've got the rather unusual situation here where there 's one mint ( the royal mint ) that makes coins for the whole uk , but there are multiple banks that issue notes : the bank of england for england and wales , the bank of scotland , the royal bank of scotland and the clydesdale bank for scotland and the bank of ireland , first trust bank , ulster bank and danske bank for northern ireland . 
  it 's the writer sir walter scott . 
   scott has been credited with rescuing the scottish banknote . 
  in 1826 , there was outrage in scotland at the attempt of parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds . 
  scott wrote a series of letters to the edinburgh weekly journal under the pseudonym `` malachi malagrowther '' for retaining the right of scottish banks to issue their own banknotes . 
  this provoked such a response that the government was forced to relent and allow the scottish banks to continue printing pound notes . 
  this campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the bank of scotland the royal bank of scotland also issue a # 100 note , that one has lord ilay ( the first governor of the bank ) on it , and the clydesdale bank do one that has the artist charles rennie mackintosh on it . 
  smallest : [ 1 penny ] ( http://www.coins-of-the-uk.co.uk/pics/dec/01/1_84.jpg ) = $ 0.0115 / 1.15 cents largest : [ # 100 note ] ( http://www.britishnotes.co.uk/news_and_info/scottishlatestnews/bos_100_new.jpg ) = $ 115,

  hey , us too !, 
  i suppose it 's possible but , to me , brexit seems to be more about going back to `` the good old days '' and `` reclaiming our sovereignty '' than striking out in some bold new direction .
