   the uk : this country allows indians , pakistanians and maybe people from some other former colonies to come - it has nothing to do with eu rules and depends solely on uk government . 
  or people in the uk are more obsessed about migrants from within eu - polish and lithuanian , for example ? 
  if so then i do n't understand why : i doubt that migrants from poland or lithuania set cars on fire or live on social benefits . 
  to my mind , it should be the opposite - only those who have some profession or can do `` valuable '' things with their hands will come to the uk from those countries otherwise they would not `` survive '' there . 
  is it correct ? 
  the uk allows citizens of eea countries to freely live and work and study here , in the same way that all eea countries grant those rights to all citizens of eea countries . 
  for all other countries , the uk requires people to apply for a visa if they intend to come here for anything other than a short tourist visit . 
  most of these visas - work visa , study visa , etc. 
  - do n't discriminate between countries but there is an ancestry visa for people from commonwealth countries who have a british grandparent ( i assume that 's what you were getting at with your `` indians and pakistanis '' comment , though it applies to 51 different countries ) . 
  [ skara brae is a stone-built neolithic settlement , located on the bay of skaill on the west coast of mainland , the largest island in the orkney archipelago of scotland . 
  consisting of eight clustered houses , it was occupied from roughly 3180 bc to about 2500 bc . 
  europe 's most complete neolithic village , skara brae gained unesco world heritage site status as one of four sites making up `` the heart of neolithic orkney '' . 
  older than stonehenge and the great pyramids , it has been called the `` scottish pompeii '' because of its excellent preservation . 
  [ yeah , this gets me fired up a lot more than that muse track .

  a mixture of music and business skills . 
  there 's an eu-wide definition of * relative poverty : *  people are said to be living in poverty if their income and resources are so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard of living considered acceptable in the society in which they live . 
  because of their poverty they may experience multiple disadvantage through unemployment , low income , poor housing , inadequate health care and barriers to lifelong learning , culture , sport and recreation . 
  they are often excluded and marginalised from participating in activities ( economic , social and cultural ) that are the norm for other people and their access to fundamental rights may be restricted . 
  in the uk , this is defined as having a household income of 60 % or less of the median household income , which works out at # 284 ( $ 329 , $ 349 ) per household per week . 
  on an income that low , you 'd still have access to comprehensive healthcare and education ( as those things are funded by the state ) and , depending on your exact situation , government housing , help with paying your rent and local taxes , money to help buy things for your child , etc. 
  the uk military allows commonwealth , irish and nepali citizens to join . 
  i can only answer for where i live ( scotland ) : - can you move here ? 
  yes , your eu passport gives you the right to live and work and study here . 
  brexit may complicate things though . 
  - can you study to be a nurse ? 
  hard to say . 
  you will need to have reached a certain standard of education before you can do an undergraduate nursing degree and you do n't seem to be confident that you 've reached that level . 
  you could do a pre-university course to get you up to the required level . 
  the other big issue will be funding - you wo n't qualify to have your tuition fees paid until you 've lived here ( or another eu country ) for three years ; before then you 'd be liable to pay the full international student rate . 
  - can you get a job as a nurse ? 
  not really an area i know much about . 
  there 's a sub for the national health service at / r/nhs / - would you be too old to get married ? 
  i doubt it - the average age for first marriages here is 32.9 years for men and 31.0 years for women . 
  i 'm sure it was  it 's lovely up here in scotland though . 
  yes , the tap water where i live tastes great .

  i live in a city of 150,000 people and have a tesco , asda , sainsbury 's , aldi , lidl , morrisons , co-op and m&s food within a mile or two but my nearest waitrose is 60 miles away . 
   the statues in front of buckingham palace looked older than that , but it could just be confirmation bias , as i expect everything i see in europe to be incredibly old !, 
  those statues are part of the victoria memorial , which was designed in 1901 , unveiled in 1911 and finally completed in 1924 . 
  the four bronze statues are * peace * ( holding an olive branch ) , * progress * ( holding a torch ) , * agriculture * ( holding a sickle ) and * manufacture * ( holding a hammer ) . 
  they 're supposed to represent `` victorian qualities '' . 
  is this just for one part of the uk ? 
  for the uk as a whole , the market shares are : - tesco - 28.1 % - sainsbury 's - 16.5 % - asda - 15.6 % - morrisons - 10.9 % - aldi - 6.2 % co-op used to be # 5 but they got overtaken last year . 
  they 're currently on 6.0 % . 
  waitrose are at 5.3 % uk-wide . 
  yes , i would say so . 
  i do n't think it 's reasonable to say that you hate a whole nationality ( though obviously there are xenophobic people who do hold beliefs like that ) . 
  even for countries that we have a poor relationship with , there 's always a sense that it 's the government of a country that we do n't get on with , rather than the people as a whole . 
   what did he mean by the ` w ' in ` wooj ' ? 
  he means one of the ways that americans usually say the `` r sound '' - interrupting the airflow with the tip of the tongue ( called a * tap * or * flap * ) or touching the roof of the mouth with the front of the tongue ( called an * alveolar * or * retroflex approximant , * depending on how exactly you do it ) . 
  those sounds sound closer to a `` w sound '' to him than they do to his `` r sound '' , which in french is made by touching the back of the tongue to the uvula - very different from the typical english r sounds . 
  i did n't learn about american english or french or phonetics at school ; it 's something i became interested in as an adult - partly through frustration at trying to describe my accent online , 
  the american pronunciation is / \u02ccb\u00e6t\u0259n \u02c8ru\u02d0\u0292 / and the french pronunciation is [ b\u0251t\u0254\u0303 \u0281u\u0292 ] . 
  the most noticeable difference , as / u/bougnette said , is that ( most ) americans use a / \u0279\u0320 / sound and french speakers use a / \u0281 / sound . 
  if that did n't make much sense then you can hear the sounds here : - the `` r '' sound used by most americans - [ postalveolar approximant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alveolar_and_postalveolar_approximants ) - the `` r '' sound used by french speakers - [ voiced uvular fricative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_uvular_fricative ), 
  the african-americans - a great bunch of lads . 
  for the uk : - personification : [ britannia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/britannia ) for scotland : - personification : [ caledonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caledonia ) - national animal : [ the unicorn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unicorn#scotland ) - floral emblem : [ the thistle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thistle ), 
  no , not even close . 
  mid-20s is as hot as it gets where i live . 
   i think on of the ways the misconception is created is from people saying they are from the uk instead of just saying `` oh , i 'm from wales . '', 
  that 's surprising as , if i was abroad , i would introduce myself as being from the uk first and then only narrow it down further if asked .

  i think * america * is the most common colloquial way to refer to the country here . 
  * united states * and * united states of america * seem like the more `` proper '' names you 'd use in more official contexts and * usa * seems somewhere in between . 
  they sound like the things many people here also say - that they consider themselves to be a civic nation , distinct from the larger country ( ie the uk or spain ) and that they do n't feel like the national government has their interests in mind and they would prefer that their nation govern itself . 
   do you have people in your country thinking like this ? 
  yes , and in fact there has been quite a lot of correspondence between independence campaigners in scotland and catalonia . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  austin powers did n't bother me since i assumed it was meant to be a `` comedy accent '' rather than an attempt to portray an actual british accent . 
  austin powers ca n't seem to keep track of which `` t '' sound he uses and whether his accent is rhotic or not . 
  i liked it , except for mike myers ' accent . 
  here , it 's generally perfectly legal to cross the road wherever you please . 
  the main exception to this is motorways , where it 's actually a criminal offence to cross one as a pedestrian or to walk alongside one ( except in an emergency ) . 
  it 's also illegal to `` loiter on a crossing '' or to cross a railway level crossing when the warning light is on . 
  i must be old because nobody else has mentioned [ conkers . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conkers )  conkers is a traditional children 's game in britain and ireland played using the seeds of horse chestnut trees -- the name ` conker ' is also applied to the seed and to the tree itself . 
  the game is played by two players , each with a conker threaded onto a piece of string : they take turns striking each other 's conker until one breaks .

  it 's the un declaration of human rights . 
  countries that have ratified this convention agree that everyone has the right to seek asylum from persecution in other countries and to move freely around within their own country and to freely leave and re-enter their own country . 
  it does n't ( as far as i know ) require any country to grant any particular asylum seeker refugee status nor does it prevent them from allowing non-asylum seekers into the country .
