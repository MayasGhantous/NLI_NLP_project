  so , i would disagree with the above poster and say that a blanket ban on granting visas to nationals of certain countries probably does n't violate international law , though it may contravene national legislation . 
  personally , i would be against that sort of blanket ban . 
  people from countries that we do n't have great diplomatic relations with already have to apply for visas to visit , and everyone from a non-eea country has to apply for a visa to study or work here . 
  people who are considered a risk to the country can be singled out individually . 
  also , i doubt that a ban of that type would be very effective in reducing terrorism here . 
  of the five people who have committed lethal terrorist attacks in great britain since 2010 , one was ukrainian , one was somalian and three were british . 
  yes , you can say things in scots such as * the bairn was greetin in the kirk * and be more easily understood by scandinavians than by english speakers . 
  interesting orthography there . 
  presumably * s\u00e7\u00f3tsl\u00edd * is the scots leid but the rest is rather a mystery . 
  ah , cool . 
  apparently it 's a cognate of * gr\u00e5ta * and * gr\u00e6de . 
  yes , well done !, 
  literally * what is your crying face all about ? 
  * but it means * what are you upset about ? 
  spot on , pal !, 
  a carrera subway bicycle . 
  it was on sale . 
  the standard way to pronounce * third * is with a / \u03b8 / sound - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_dental_fricative - but many people will use / f / instead . 
  in scotland there are 9,686 people aged 3 to 15 who can understand , read or write scottish gaelic , versus 729,465 who ca n't . 
  for ages 16 to 24 the figures are 9,653 who can understand , read or write scottish gaelic versus 622,835 who ca n't . 
  these speakers are n't uniformly distributed across scotland though . 
  in some areas you 'd struggle to find anyone who speaks the language and in other areas it 's not uncommon to see gaelic road signs . 
  what would you set as the requirement for graduating secondary school here ? 
  it 's laid out like that except that every bullet point is a checkbox and you tick your answer ( and , if you 've chosen any of the `` other '' options , write in your answer ) . 
  edit : [ you can see a sample census form here . 
  ] ( http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/householdpre-addressed27_05_10specimen.pdf ), 
  these were the categories used on the last census for the question * what is your ethnic group ? 
  : * a - white : - scottish - other british - irish - gypsy / traveller - polish - other b - mixed or multiple - any mixed or multiple c - asian , asian scottish or asian british : - pakistani , pakistani scottish or pakistani british - indian , indian scottish or indian british - bangladeshi , bangladeshi scottish or bangladeshi british - chinese , chinese scottish or chinese british - other d - african : - african , african scottish or african british - other e - caribbean or black : - caribbean , caribbean scottish or caribbean british - black , black scottish or black british - other f - other : - arab , arab scottish or arab british - other, 
  there was a kingdom of ireland ( that covered the whole island ) from 1542 until 1800 . 
  if irish people today consider that to be a predecessor state of modern ireland ( i do n't know if they do or they do n't ) then they could argue that they have lost the territory that became northern ireland . 
  glad you liked it here !, 
   i was amazed at how relaxed i felt among the scots in comparison . 
   but why do you even call it `` swede '' anyway ? 
  up here in scotland , we call swedish turnips * neeps , * from the latin word for turnip - * n\u0101pus . 
  yes , plus it would n't count as hate speech here since that requires intent to cause a person harassment , alarm or distress or intent to stir up racial hatred or intent to stir up religious hatred . 
  people would studiously ignore you . 
  i see weirder things on the bus all the time . 
  it depends on exactly how you want to define the term . 
  parts of the magna carta ( 1215 ) are still part of the law here and those concern constitutional matters but that 's only one small part of our constitution . 
  i dread to think what the us 's reaction would be to a domestic terrorist organisation who blew up the first lady 's uncle or fired a mortar at the white house . 
   a high def photo of the uks greasiest kebab shop * leonie , the love lewis has for you extends to the abra-kebabra on the high street and back !, 
  it 's nothing personal , it 's just that we 've had similar posts - almost word-for-word - from other posters for the past few days and people here are getting a bit weary of them . 
  time to add tonygaze 's romance tips to the sidebar !, 
  mate , you 're like the fifth person this week that 's asked here about this `` unique gift '' . 
  there 's the [ uk ancestry visa ] ( https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa/overview ) for commonwealth citizens with a grandparent born in the uk . 
  would that apply to you ? 
  i was never into any sports until i started watching mma a few years ago . 
  i dunno if combat sports are your thing but if you 've got a few minutes free then you might want to check out what 's considered one of the best-ever mma fights : [ dan `` hendo '' henderson versus mauricio `` shogun '' rua . 
  ] ( http://fullmmavideos.com/dan-henderson-vs-shogun-rua-full-fight-video ), 
  yes , i wa n't sure about calling mma `` an american sport '' and it 's really only the ufc that i watch , and they are an american company . 
  ufc definitely is n't the name of a sport though  maybe it 's like someone saying they like the eredivisie rather than football . 
  the ultimate fighting championship . 
  no , but i was starting my last year of school then . 
  [ there 's a three-way dispute going on between the uk , spain and gibraltar . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disputed_status_of_gibraltar ) i can only guess that brexit is going to make that whole situation more complicated . 
  i took / u/19djafoij02 's question to just be about the uk 's borders but we can talk about overseas territories too , if he likes . 
  if we were including overseas territories then the last time our territory changed would have been in 1997 . 
  i think you 're right about the falklands being the only disputed one , though apparently we 're going to transfer some of akrotiri and dhekelia to cyprus soon . 
  our current border was set in 1922 . 
  the most active movements for changing things are irish republicans ( who want northern ireland to leave the uk and join ireland ) , scottish nationalists ( who want scotland to leave the uk ) and welsh nationalists ( who want wales to leave the uk ) . 
  theses are the movements that have political parties with elected members . 
  there are other proposals - shetland leaving the uk and joining norway , london becoming an independent city-state , northern ireland becoming in independent country , etc. 
  - but these have not had much success . 
  dundee , on scotland 's east coast . 
  we very rarely get snow here but it 's more common as you go inland and higher up . 
  the temperature usually varies from around 1 to 6 c ( 34 to 43 f ) - cold but nowhere near as cold as where you are . 
  the worst part is probably just the lack of light - today the sun rose at 08:02 and sets at 16:48 and we only get an average of 2.75 hours of sunshine per day in february , and less in january and december . 
  if they are blatantly queue-jumping or the like then absolutely , yes . 
  if it 's things like queuing at a bar because they do n't realise there 's table service or not queuing somewhere because they do n't realise a host or hostess seats you then that 's more understandable . 
  we get the reverse here where american tourists will sit at a table in a pub for a while before realising that there 's no waitress service . 
  we do have lots of mcdonalds here in scotland , 
  if british people are n't queuing properly abroad then i 'd guess either they are taking advantage of being away from home to misbehave or they are , for some reason , mis-reading social cues . 
  * i 'm walkin ' here !, 
  for scotland , probably the fact that haggis-hunting still goes on . 
  the government banned it years ago but it still goes on in the highlands and the local police turn a blind eye to it because they think it 's part of their traditional culture . 
  it 's very cruel though and unnecessary these days because you can get farmed haggis that tastes just as good . 
  [ he 's a little bit unpopular here . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/5r2pe3/antitrump_protest_sign_in_glasgow_tonight/ ), 
  it 's crazy . 
  either the us government did n't think this thing through at all or they do n't care about how its affecting people . 
  [ a british member of parliament has said that he is now banned from the usa because he war born in iraq , even though he fled in country in the 1970 's . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-mp-reveals-he-is-banned-from-us-under-trumps-muslim-ban-a7551511.html ) it 's been great to see that many americans are as unhappy about this travel ban ( or more so ) than us . 
  yes . 
  the different language was n't much of a problem in paris because so many people there spoke english . 
  also , the city just `` made sense '' to me - the people there lived their lives in a similar way to the people at home . 
  by contrast , even though i was able to speak the local language in the usa , it just felt ... less familiar . 
  the architecture was different , the cities were laid out differently , we could n't walk around and explore like we could in france or malta ( you 're expected to drive everywhere ) , etc. 
  yeah , not the most diplomatic way to handle things . 
  [ the last guy , on the other hand ... ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/22/20/3372ff1400000578-3554403-image-a-77_1461352863631.jpg ), 
  i 've been into [ stevie nicks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn8-4tjpxd8 ) a lot recently . 
  i 've only been to three foreign countries , so i 'll just rank them : - usa - malta - france, 
  - [ ny post - white house warns prince charles against `` lecturing '' on climate change ] ( https://nypost.com/2017/01/29/white-house-warns-prince-charles-against-lecturing-on-climate-change ) - [ the independent - donald trump and prince charles `` in diplomacy row over climate change '' ahead of president 's first uk visit ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-prince-charles-climate-change-environment-uk-visit-queen-a7551701.html ) - [ the telegraph - trump 's team fears climate change differences with prince charles could flare up in state visit ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/28/trumps-team-fears-climate-change-differences-prince-charles ), 
  it 's a sad state of affairs that `` the past two weeks '' covers so many unpleasant incidents . 
  some british citizens being suddenly banned from entering or transiting through the usa was not a very friendly thing to do . 
  i would have liked if our government could have expressed its displeasure more , but i realise that the uk is probably not in the position to be turning down friendships at the moment . 
  it was also reported that the white house `` warned '' prince charles not to `` lecture '' donald trump during his state visit here , and that has n't gone down very well to say the least . 
  in fact , 1,829,653 people have petitioned parliament to stop the upcoming state visit , though , again , that 's not something the government feel they can do . 
  we could start calling north america `` the mysterious occident '' if you 'd like ? 
  those sound good to me !, 
  other people have mentioned andy murray , alex ferguson and calvin harris and those are all certainly very famous scottish people but i would never have thought of them as i 'm not into tennis , football or pop music .
