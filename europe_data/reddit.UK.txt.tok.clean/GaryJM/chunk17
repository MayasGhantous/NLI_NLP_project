  he 's actually on every bank of scotland note as a tribute to him campaigning for scottish banks to retain the right to print their own banknotes .

  very good , 
  that 's a good answer , though i suppose i do n't really think of him as coming from `` my country '' . 
  it 's just the scottish form of the name elizabeth english . 
  in the uk , `` asian '' ( without any other context ) usually means south asia . 
  if you said you wanted `` asian food '' then i would take you out for curry . 
  in the usa , asking for `` asian food '' might get you sushi . 
  we have * boreal , oriental , austral * and * occidental * for , respectively , * northern , eastern , southern * and * western * - is it similar in german ? 
  ah , cool . 
  i think that if you said `` an oriental gentleman '' here , you would just sound very old-fashioned , rather than pejorative ( which i guess it would in american english ? 
  far east for me . 
  it 's not pejorative here but it is in american english so it 's something i 'd avoid online but would use in person . 
  edit : `` oriental studies '' is fine but i would n't call a person `` an oriental '' and i probably would n't say `` an oriental person '' , i 'd say east asian or far eastern . 
  it 's not great and i 'd rather political discourse here was always non-violent . 
  equally , all through my childhood there were near-constant terrorist attacks happening here so a few people slapping each other around does n't reach the level of `` worrying '' yet . 
  what aspect of that video are you referring to ? 
  what if people here started supporting donald trump ? 
  or attacking his supporters ? 
  not really a problem i foresee happening in scotland , to be honest . 
  yes , episode 2 - * ink and incapability * - of blackadder the third . 
  prince george decides to become a patron of dr johnson 's new dictionary . 
  i thought he might be , because he 's played by the scottish actor robbie coltrane in the * blackadder * tv series . 
  but you 're right - he 's english . 
  [ dr samuel johnson ? 
  ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_johnson ), 
  that 's an interesting question too - maybe we should start another post , `` who is the most famous person from [ country ] ? '', 
  i was thinking it might be sean connery . 
  historically , yeah probably william wallace . 
  the scottish people that we have on our money here are : - robert burns ( poet ) - mary slessor ( missionary ) - robert the bruce ( monarch ) - adam smith ( economist ) - william thomson , 1st baron kelvin ( physicist , also he was born in present day northern ireland ) - alexander fleming ( pharmacologist ) - elsie inglis ( doctor and suffragist ) - charles rennie mackintosh ( architect and artist ) - william arrol ( civil engineer ), 
  for british tv viewers : - living : graham norton ( or possibly dara \u00d3 briain ) - dead : terry wogan for mma fans : - conor mcgregor, 
  yeah . 
  if i limited it to just scotland then , hmm ... who is the most famous scot ? 
  mirko `` cro cop '' filipovi\u0107 is very famous amongst mma fans , is he famous in his home country ? 
  if only you 'd asked yesterday , then the people who were doing this for the last person who asked then could have done one for you at the same time . 
  totally legal here . 
  people burn all sorts of flags as protests against all sorts of things . 
  the consequences vary depending on the cause being protested but there generally are n't legal consequences , if that 's what you meant . 
  there was a case where a woman was convicted of a public order offence for stamping on an american flag ( in protest at a us airbase here ) . 
  her conviction was overturned on appeal , due to violating her article 10 rights . 
  i agree that article 10 of the echr does indeed give everyone the freedom to burn flags :  everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
  this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . 
  ... and i support this freedom . 
  i realised that was what you must have meant just after i posted . 
  i suppose i should add that i would n't want to see donald trump unsuccessfully impeached , as that would probably give him extra credibility . 
  call me a big old euro-commie-pinko but i 'm not a fan of his businessman-like approach to politics . 
   of course no president in us history has been impeached https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/impeachment_of_andrew_johnson https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/impeachment_of_bill_clinton that aside , i would n't be sad to see donald trump leave office but i would n't say i really supported or opposed his impeachment , as it seems like too much of an internal american legal matter .

   of all those , only oil in aberdeen and a few warship contracts for ships in glasgow survive . 
  i 'd say d.c. thomson are n't * quite * dead yet . 
  my city was traditionally known for `` jute , jam and journalism '' but those are n't very big anymore . 
  probably the [ spaghetti-tree hoax . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spaghetti-tree_hoax )  the spaghetti-tree hoax was a three-minute hoax report broadcast on april fools ' day 1957 by the bbc current-affairs programme panorama , purportedly showing a family in southern switzerland harvesting spaghetti from the family `` spaghetti tree '' . 
  at the time spaghetti was relatively little known in the uk , so that many britons were unaware that it is made from wheat flour and water ; a number of viewers afterwards contacted the bbc for advice on growing their own spaghetti trees . 
  decades later cnn called this broadcast `` the biggest hoax that any reputable news establishment ever pulled '' there 's also the infamous * ghostwatch . 
  * this was a television film broadcast on hallowe'en ( so , not an april fool 's day joke ) and was n't intended to be a hoax . 
  it was meant to be a fake documentary about a haunted house . 
  the presentation was too realistic for some though and many people thought they were watching a real news report . 
  apparently it 's bruges .

  something like the double jeopardy ( scotland ) act 2011 ? 
  it allows for someone to be re-tried for the same crime : - where the acquittal is tainted by offences against the course of justice such as ( but not limited to ) bribery , perverting the course of justice and subornation of perjury . 
  - where the previously acquitted has made a credible admission of guilt . 
  - where new evidence which was not and could not with ordinary diligence have been available at the trial has been found . 
  it 's a carbonated soft drink that 's made here in scotland . 
  it 's rumoured to out-sell coca-cola . 
  the taste is hard to describe . 
  edit : just had a look on youtube for `` americans trying irn-bru '' and i 've seen it variously described as tasting of `` oranges '' , `` lemon-lime '' , `` cream soda '' and `` bubblegum '' . 
  [ irn bru is pretty popular . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/unpv0ry4hqby.jpg ), 
  article 6 of the european convention on human rights provides for the right to a fair trial and clause 2 is :  everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law . 
  so all 47 council of europe members are supposed to consider `` innocent until proven guilty '' to be a human right ( or rather , part of the right to a fair trial ) and to protect that right . 
  whether they all do or not , i ca n't say . 
  i do n't have much experience of the justice system here , though i think it 's considered to be a fair system , on average . 
  i 'm afraid the grrm books that i 've read have been the more light-hearted ones , so i ca n't compare the two . 
  the main `` disturbing '' parts of * perdido street station * are to do with the sort of `` adult '' criminal activities you might find in other books ( drugs , prostitution , etc. ), 
  along with a fair helping of body horror ( criminals are often punished by being surgically altered ) and bit of lovecraftian things-that-should-not-be such as the weavers - utterly alien creatures whose only interest is altering the world to suit their own sense of aesthetics . 
  the first book - * perdido street station * - is a bit like an * extremely * dark version of discworld 's ankh-morpork , in that it 's set in a major city ( new crobuzon ) with rival races , political factions and so on , along with a blend of magic and early industrial technology . 
  oh , and mind-bending incomprehensible horrors . 
  if you like the discworld novels ( or anything similar ) but you wish they were more disturbing then i 'd recommend the bas-lag series . 
  i think my favourites are iain m banks * the culture * - a far-future , pan-galactic anarchist utopian society - and china mi\u00e9ville 's * bas-lag * setting - a steampunk setting with fantastical elements . 
  if any of the countries you intend to visit are as strict as the uk then you wo n't be able to get a visa to do workaway-style work at all . 
  the uk does a short-term work visa for people from cool countries like canada and australia but if you were american ( for example ) then you could only come here to do high-paying skilled work or unpaid work for a registered charity , and in both cases you would need to be sponsored by a british sponsor . 
  each country will have its own work visa requirements but i 'm afraid i 'm not familiar with them . 
  you 'll need a work visa from the british government to be able to work in the uk . 
  canadians are elgibile for the [ tier 5 ( youth mobility ) visa ] ( https://www.gov.uk/tier-5-youth-mobility ) which lets you live and work in the uk for up to two years . 
  universities here in scotland usually state their entry requirements for americans in terms of sat scores and ap courses taken ( or their equivalents ) . 
  transferring from a community college may be possible ; i think i 've seen some universities that offer the possibility of starting in second year if you have an associate 's degree . 
  while aberdeen angus cattle have become very popular , they 'll never be as iconic as the highland cow . 
  people who are ordinarily resident in the uk are entitled to treatment by the national health service . 
  this is actually four separate services ( for england , scotland , wales and northern ireland ) and there are slight differences between them . 
  they are all publicly funded . 
  here in scotland , the nhs provides all types of healthcare without charge , with a few exceptions : dental treatment ( excluding examinations ) have a small co-payment and eye care ( excluding examinations ) is n't covered , though there is help available with all these payments if you need it .
