  you can also purchase private medical insurance ( though you do n't get a rebate on your taxes or anything ) . 
  this allows you to be treated at some private hospitals , though many procedures will still involve you visiting an nhs hospital , albeit as a private patient .

  yes , i think it 's only natural for americans to wonder about how their new president has affected their international image , especially with some of the things he 's said about nato , the eu , brexit and so on . 
  if it 's just normal banter between friends then you should just tease them right back : * hey / u/jimiisalive30 - how many burgers did you eat today you big american bloater ? 
  * * hey / u/garyjm - how many bottles of buckfast did you drink today you big scottish alcoholic ? 
  * but if they 're really going too far then just tell them so and , if they 're good friends , they 'll stop teasing you about that subject . 
  heads or tails here as well . 
  nope . 
   op is offering you a free piece of culture that is really important to his city , it makes me sad that you rather make fun of him instead of taking advantage of his generosity . 
  i think op had good intentions but there 's a difference ( to us at least ) between offering someone a gift and giving someone the chance to compete for a prize . 
  the latter does n't come across as being really generous , which is why i think he 's rubbed people up the wrong way . 
  edit : even if op has committed a * faux pas , * we should be understanding and forgiving .

  * british * is the adjective to describe people from the uk ; there is n't a word that means * united kingdomish . 
  * lots of british people do n't identify as british though . 
  there have n't been separate scottish and english monarchies since 1707 , just a single british one . 
  elizabeth ii is only `` queen of england '' in the same way that theresa may is `` prime minister of skegness . '', 
  i do n't mind when people whose first language is n't english call the uk * england * or * great britain * - many languages do n't have a word for the uk . 
  what i do mind are native english speakers who call elizabeth ii `` the queen of england '' or say that the us declared independence from `` england '' or things like that . 
  i 've never flown with british airways ; the only airlines i 've flown with are ryanair and britannia .

  yes , the system we have is called a unitary state . 
  wikipedia has a good definition :  a unitary state is a state governed as a single power in which the central government is ultimately supreme and any administrative divisions ( sub-national units ) exercise only powers that the central government chooses to delegate . 
  the majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government . 
  of the 192 un member states , 165 of them are governed as unitary states . 
  this system contrasts with a * federation , * of which there are a couple of dozen today :  a federation is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central ( federal ) government . 
  in a federation , the self-governing status of the component states , as well as the division of power between them and the central government , is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party , the states or the federal political body . 
  excellent question !, 
  the difference is that scotland 's parliament exists because westminster has decided to devolve some legislative power to it . 
  legally , how much or little power it devolves is totally up to westminster , though obviously there are political consequences in practice . 
  in theory , westminster can create and remove sub-national parliaments as it wishes . 
  contrast that with california . 
  california is a sovereign entity in its own right . 
  the us government ca n't unilaterally decide to split california up into multiple states , or to combine california with neighbouring states , or anything like that . 
  california 's relationship with the us government is defined by the constitution . 
   are not all european states federal in some aspect ? 
  i would n't say so . 
  i always though * federal * described a specific type of political structure , where regions within a country ( typically called * states * ) share sovereignty with the country as a whole and have a relationship that 's defined in a constitution . 
  the uk definitely does not have this type of political structure . 
  we 're a * unitary country * where only the uk has soverignty . 
  there are no sovereign federal states comparable to bavaria or queensland or california . 
  no , sinn f\u00e9in and the social democratic and labour party both support northern ireland leaving the uk and plaid cymru support wales leaving the uk . 
  outside of westminster , the scottish green party also support scottish independence . 
  there are also parties who support scottish independence but who do n't have any elected politicians , such solidarity , rise and the scottish libertarian party . 
  - name : the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland - government : unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy - head of state : elizabeth ii ( since 1952 ) - head of government : theresa may ( since 2016 ) - governing party : the conservative party ( centre-right , conservatism , economic liberalism , british unionism ) - national day : we 're one of the two countries that do n't have one .

  well , if we got divided up based on who was across the north sea from us : - everything south of folkestone becomes french - folkestone to sheerness becomes belgian - sheerness to grimsby becomes dutch - grimsby to newcastle-upon-tyne becomes german - newcastle-upon tyne to fraserborough becomes danish - fraserboroigh to golspie becomes swedish - everything north of golspie becomes norwegian so scotland becomes mostly danish , apart from the very north and the orkney and shetland islands , which become norwegian , and a tiny strip of land north of inverness which becomes swedish . 
  northumberland and tyne and wear also become danish . 
  the rest of the north of england becomes german . 
  wales and the midlands and much of the south of england becomes dutch and the rest of the south becomes belgian , with london being divided between the two . 
  the south coast of england and much of devon and cornwall become french . 
  hmm , if scotland was transferred to our nearest neighbour then we 'd become irish , which would n't be too bad and some people here would definitely prefer it over being british . 
  the shetland islands ' nearest neighbour is norway so they could go back to being norwegian . 
  they 're pretty norwegian at the moment anyway . 
  there were 25 antisemitic offences reported in scotland in 2015 : 3 breaches of the peace , 9 instances of threatening or abusive behaviour , 8 offensive communications , 3 instances of acting in a racially aggravated manner and 2 other offences . 
  i do n't think that a jewish person would be treated differently by the vast majority of people , though i have to admit it 's not something i 've got any experience of , probably because only 0.1 % of people in scotland are jewish .

  i live in a suburb of a small city in scotland . 
  it used to be a separate village so it has its own local high street [ main street ] . 
  i mostly work from home , so no travel needed there . 
  i get my non-perishable groceries delivered once a month from a nearby supermarket . 
  i also walk there ( 1 mile round-trip ) several times a week to pick up perishable items ( and things i forgot to order ) . 
  for things like going to the post office , barber , coffee shop , pub , etc. 
  i walk to my suburb 's high street , which is a 2 mile round-trip . 
  for household items that i ca n't get from my nearby supermarket , i walk to a larger out-of-town supermarket , which is a 4 mile round-trip . 
  for any other things ( restaurants , cinemas , specialist shops ) i will get the bus to the city centre [ downtown ] which is a half-mile walk and a 4 mile bus trip each way . 
  edit : you may have seen [ this image ] ( https://i.imgur.com/o609wga.png ) showing how much more you can reach with a one mile walk in a `` compact '' versus `` sprawling '' neighbourhood . 
  since europe is generally much denser than the us , `` walking distance '' here puts you within reach of a huge number of places that you might want to go ( unless you live somewhere rural ) .

  the european parliament is divided up into several `` political groups '' . 
  these are `` parties of parties '' containing different political parties with similar politics . 
  for example , the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats has members from the uk 's labour party and germany 's social democratic party and italy 's democratic party and so on . 
  these political groups put forward candidates to run for president of the european parliament and the meps vote on the candidates and the winner becomes president . 
  martin schultz won last time with 387 of the 670 votes cast .
