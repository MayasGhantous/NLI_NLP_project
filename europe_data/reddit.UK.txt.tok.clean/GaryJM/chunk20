  do all of our monarchs have the same inheritance laws ? 
  do we all have primogeniture ? 
  - belgium , demark , the netherlands , sweden and the uk use absolute primogeniture . 
  - liechtenstein uses agnatic primogeniture . 
  - luxembourg uses a mixture of absolute primogeniture and agnatic primogeniture . 
  - monaco , norway and spain use male-preference cognatic primogeniture . 
  - the vatican elects its monarch . 
  - andorra has its co-princes appointed . 
  absolute primogeniture means the monarch 's oldest child is next in line , then their younger children , then the monarch 's oldest sibling . 
  agnatic primogeniture means the monarch 's brothers are in line before the monarch 's sons . 
  male-preference cognatic primogeniture means the monarch 's oldest son is next in line , then younger sons , then daughters , then oldest brother , and so on . 
  yep .

  st andrew 's university is pretty prestigious . 
  it was founded in 1413 and is the oldest university in scotland and the third-oldest english-speaking university after the two you mentioned . 
  notable alumni include king james ii of scotland ; united states declaration of independence signatory james wilson ; discoverer of logarithms john napier ; founder of the church of scotland and leader of the protestant reformation john knox ; inventor of beta-blockers and nobel prize in medicine winner james black ; pioneer of the smallpox vaccine edward jenner and , perhaps most famously , the duke and duchess of cambridge . 
  slightly newer are the university of glasgow ( 1451 ) and the university of edinburgh ( 1582 ) , both home to many , many famous people . 
  the times higher education supplement has edinburgh at number 24 in the world , glasgow at 76 and st andrews at 86 . 
  yep . 
  we had high hopes that charles kennedy would also manage to raise an army of hardy mountain folk and bring asia minor under his dominion but he never quite managed it .

  well , in this country we have a bat-and-ball game called * rounders * that 's very similar to american baseball and [ british baseball . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_baseball ) it 's usually played with a short bat but you could use a full-sized baseball bat i suppose . 
  in what world does someone striking a thrown ball with a bat look like soccer to you ? 
  hmm , sounds like you 're definitely not from the north or midlands of england then  you can imagine ozzie osbourne saying `` i 've cut my foot ! '', 
  and using / \u028a / for both * cut * and * foot * - `` i 've coot me foot ! '', 
  nope . 
  * roof * is / r\u0289f / - with the foot / goose vowel - and * rough * is / r\u028cf / - with the strut vowel . 
  are those merged in your accent ? 
  edit : turns out there is a thing called the * foot-strut split * which occurs everywhere except in northern england and the midlands , so a few people will have * roof * and * rough * as homophones , but not me . 
  yep . 
  like i said , i ca n't hear the difference . 
  i just looked up what happens in scouse accents but the wikipedia article does n't explain it well enough . 
  i can tell you that rp uses / u / for the goose set of words and / \u028a / for the foot set of words but scottish english ( and scots ) uses / u / for both . 
   not in scottish accents yeah , i ca n't even * hear * a difference between those sounds . 
  i was shocked when i read that '' * pool * and * pull * are homophones in scottish english '' because i always thought they were homophones for everyone . 
  i know a lot of people who moved here to attend university and who spoke fluent english but struggled to understand the local people when they first moved here . 
  i 've even known people from england who moved here and needed time to adapt . 
  yes . 
  if you ever hear a scottish person talk about * deer stalking * ( hunting deer ) it will sound the same as `` deer stocking '' . 
  i 'm a native speaker of english and / i / and / i : / are both / i / in my accent and / \u0254\u02d0 / and / \u0252 / are both / \u0254 / .

  possession of pepper spray or a taser here [ in the uk ] is an offence under section 5 of the firearms act 1968 . 
  if convicted , the maximum sentence is ten years in prison . 
  carrying a small pocket knife is fine but carrying it for the purpose of using it as a weapon - as you seem to be considering doing - is an offence under section 1 of the prevention of crime act 1953 . 
  the penalty for this depends on what you 've done with your knife - carrying it is bad but threatening people with it is worse . 
  let 's say you want to go from edinburgh to london on the 1st of march . 
  - by train : by booking in advance and travelling in the afternoon you can get a ticket for # 32.50 ( $ 40 ) . 
  the journey takes around 4 hours and 40 minutes . 
  if you do n't book in advance than an `` anytime '' ticket will cost # 148.50 ( $ 180 ) . 
  - by bus : if you book in advance with megabus then you can get a ticket for # 1 ( $ 1.20 ) , leaving at 23:00 and arriving at 07:30 ( 8.5 hours ) . 
  or for # 3 ( $ 4 ) you can leave at 11:30 and arrive at 21:00 ( 9.5 hours ) . 
  - by plane : if you book in advance with ryanair you can get a flight for # 13 ( $ 16 ) . 
  it takes 90 minutes , though of course you have to also add in the time and cost of getting from edinburgh to the airport and from stanstead to london . 
  mmm , i can see it being less well-received in , say , omagh . 
  proper chip shop chips are definitely the best but i 'm not prepared to concede that ireland does them best ; i 'd like to think us scots know a wee bit about frying potatoes too .

  the [ pillar box war . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pillar_box_war ) in 1952 , princess elizabeth became queen and adopted the style * elizabeth the second of the united kingdom . 
  * some people , especially here in scotland , thought this was inappropriate as they considered her to be the first queen elizabeth that we 'd had - the previous queen elizabeth had been queen of england and queen of ireland but not queen of scots . 
  some postboxes , which had the royal cypher on them - e ii r - were vandalised . 
  it was decided that future british monarchs who shared names with previous monarchs would have their regnal number follow on from either the previous scottish or english monarch , depending on which was highest . 
  also , post boxes in scotland now carry an image of the crown of scotland and not the royal cypher .

  sure , but canada ( for example ) does n't have border checks between states but it does have them between canada and the usa . 
  germany does n't have border checks between its states but it does n't have them with neighbouring countries either . 
  someone in oslo can already fill their car with guns and drive it 2,200 miles to lisbon without going through any border checks , so while i do think there are many obstacles to a federal europe , `` internal security '' is unlikely to be one . 
  the issues you 've raised such as gun ownership , recreational drug use etc. 
  are n't ones i can see being problems . 
  different states in a federation can have different laws and sure , people can move between states easily but people in the eea can already live and work in each other 's countries and people can already pass between schengen members without border checks , so i do n't see it being a bit issue . 
  what would be hard , in my opinion , would be things like finances ( which you mentioned ) but also probably just the fact that most people at the moment would find it hard to consider europe `` their country '' in the way that they might currently feel french or german or spanish or italian or whatever .
