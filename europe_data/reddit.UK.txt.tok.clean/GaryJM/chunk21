  [ the royal mint supplies coins for the uk and 52 other countries .

  how would it be different from the current situation though ? 
  what would the practical difference be between two schengen area countries having different gun laws and two different states in a federal eu having different gun laws ? 
  given that norway and switzerland are both already part of the schengen area , how much more porous could their borders possibly get ? 
  there 's [ grand austria hotel ] ( https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182874/grand-austria-hotel ) but i 'm afraid it 's not a tv series . 
  scottish new year . 
   yeah , really , whenever i ring someone up and their total comes to 17.76 , they say `` good year ! '', 
  i ca n't really say much seeing as many international sporting events here begin with people lamenting soldiers who died in a battle in 1314 . 
  generally very positive . 
  we 're nato allies , ukusa allies , etc. 
  and none of the major political parties here are proposing a serious cooling of that relationship . 
  hell , we even share a common pool of submarine-launched nuclear weapons and there 's a plan in the works to operate american aircraft from the new british carrier . 
  on a personal level , british people are generally very fond of the usa . 
  i believe orlando , florida is the most-popular non-european holiday destination for british people . 
  culturally , we watch your tv and films and our media does pretty well in the usa too . 
  the most popular films here from the last few decades have been joint anglo-american productions ( such as the star wars films ) or american productions of british works ( such as the harry potter and james bond films ) . 
  i think these films also did pretty well in the us . 
  * merry christmas , happy christmas , happy new year * and * happy hogmanay * are the ones i hear people say . 
  * season 's greetings * seems like something you 'd read on a card but not say . 
  * happy holidays * is n't something i 've heard here ; the same with * holiday season . 
  i agree . 
  also , to me , `` best bud '' implies a two-way relationship and i do n't get the feeling that americans know as much about the uk ( no offence ) as people in the other countries you mentioned do . 
  all my immediate family and first cousins live within a 60 mile / 100 km radius . 
  other than that i 've got a few third cousins in the usa and canada . 
  culture and history ? 
  i 'd say ireland . 
  there 's even a tv tropes page called [ scotireland ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/scotireland ) that documents all the times people have failed to tell our two countries apart . 
  language ? 
  hard to say - there 's a lot of english-speaking countries and i do n't see how you could pick one over the other . 
  for the uk 's minority languages : scots and ulster scots are most similar to english , so again it 's hard to pick , scottish gaelic is closest to irish and manx and welsh is closest to breton . 
  i 'm not sure who our economy is most similar to but i can tell you that the country the uk imports the most from is germany ( mostly cars , car parts and medicines ) and the country we export to the most is the usa ( mostly cars , refined petroleum and medicines ) . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by `` social connections '' - could you elaborate ? 
  i ken all the words to that because we studied it at school as a wee warm-up to learning about burns ' other poems . 
  sealand , northern cyprus , transnistria , luhansk people 's republic , probably zillions of others over the years . 
  i 'm afraid i 've never seen it . 
  we get [ the snowman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhczhuzxhzu ) and many , many adaptations of * a christmas carol . 
  * oh , and the [ royal christmas message . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_christmas_message ), 
  i 'm learning so much about scandinavian culture !, 
  these days , christmas day ( 25th ) is the biggest celebration , followed by boxing day ( 26th ) . 
  this is fairly recent though - christmas day only became a public holiday in scotland in 1958 and boxing day was n't a holiday until 1974 !, 
  traditionally , the big holiday here was hogmanay ( 31st december ) . 
  it 's still a big deal here and we enjoy it so much that both the 1st and 2nd of january are public holidays , to give us time to recover . 
  yeah , the 1919 to 1921 state was self-declared and had extremely limited recognition so i suggest op use 1921 for the date ireland leaves the uk . 
  otherwise he 'll have to include every other self-declared state , 
  a few mistakes with my country : - scotland turns pink in 1603 , suggesting we came under the control of england . 
  as far as i know , scotland was an independent country right up until the acts of union 1707 . 
  speaking of which ... - * the united kingdom * appears in 1707 , which is 94 years too early . 
  the state that was created in 1707 was the kingdom of great britain . 
  this covered great britain and its offshore islands but * not * ireland , which was the separate kingdom of ireland . 
  - 1801 shows the united kingdom incorporating ireland ; this should be shows as the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland combining into the united kingdom of great britain and ireland . 
  - 1919 - creation of the irish republic . 
  ooh , a rather controversial inclusion  - 1922 - if you want to be pedantic , * ireland * should be the * irish free state * from 1922 to 1937 . 
  edit : james vi , king of scots became the king of england and ireland as well in 1603 , so perhaps you could label the whole area `` scotland '' ? 
  i had a good chat on / r/askanamerican before and i think a lot of people there would love to go abroad if it was as cheap as it is here and if , as you say , they had the time . 
  there was a canadian on / r/scotland once , asking about flights , and we were all amazed that it would cost them twice as much to fly from canada to the uk and back as it would cost for us to fly from the uk to canada and back . 
   cuntries such as the uk whissat ? 
  blackpool was a tiny hamlet up until the victorian era , when seaside holidays became fashionable and there were now railways that could carry the vast number of workers in cities across the north of england to the coast . 
  the huge demand meant blackpool grew fantastically quickly , and soon it had all the things we associate with seaside holidays - hotels , b&b s , a promenade , piers , donkey rides on the beach , fish-and-chip shops , and so on . 
  in 1801 its population was 500 and by 1951 it was 147,000 . 
  the appeal of the british seaside holiday was nearing an end though , as the cost of holidays in continental europe was coming down . 
  blackpool , along with the other traditional seaside resorts , stopped being cool - now everyone wanted to jet off to the costa del sol . 
  so now blackpool has a lot of hotel beds and amusements and not enough people visiting them . 
  unemployment is up and , [ according to the new statesman , ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/12/when-lights-go-out ) a new use has been found for all those empty beds - housing people that other towns ca n't find homes for :  two hundred metres inland from the promenade , pebble-dash terraces that were once guest houses and b&b s have been converted into bedsits renting for around # 65 a week and attracting a new kind of visitor . 
  blackpool has become a town where `` you can turn up with a bin bag and # 150 , and you can get a flat , '' says simon blackburn , leader of blackpool council . 
  which , in turn , puts more people off visiting . 
  i was born here and i 've lived here my whole life , as did my parents and their parents and their parents . 
  i just do n't feel like popping down to newcastle on the train is `` going abroad '' or that a weekend in blackpool is `` a foreign holiday '' . 
  if england counts as `` another country '' then i 've been `` abroad '' many times . 
  i would n't count that though . 
  but that 's where i live !, 
  very rarely . 
  around once every few years i 'd say . 
  anything they do n't make seems to be made by [ mbda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mbda#products ) or [ saab bofors dynamics . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_bofors_dynamics ), 
  * c\u00f4te d'ivoire * insist that they be called that in english , and not * ivory coast . 
  * but you 're right , nobody calls scotland * alba * or the isle of man * ellan vannin . 
  * i 'd guess its to do with disambiguating ireland-the-country from ireland-the-island . 
  if the category is `` non-mainland european countries '' then the list should be : the united kingdom , ireland , cyprus , malta and iceland . 
  i 'd call all those european . 
  joining the eu means `` demonstrating respect for human rights '' and the usual way to do this is to sign the european convention on human rights . 
  protocol 6 restricts use of the death penalty to during times of war ( all council of europe members except russia have ratified this ) and protocol 13 completely abolishes the death penalty ( russia , azerbaijan and armenia have not ratified this ) . 
  so while the usa might argue that they have demonstrated sufficient respect for human rights , it 's likely that the other eu members would disagree with that while the usa still permitted executions . 
  that 's from the old days when we had mortal monarchs . 
  i do n't know what language navid speaks to his wife , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  delonghi , gaggia , illy and lavazza . 
  to follow up from / u/grogipher 's excellent point , there are a couple of examples from scottish television that illustrate this . 
  [ one is the character of navid harrid , from the programme still game . 
  he grew up in india but moved to scotland and has now been here so long that he 's scottish through-and-through . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfrt9f82vcc ) [ the other is a sketch on * chewing the fat * about two guys who grew up in glasgow but have lived in canada their whole lives . 
  they visit scotland and are proud of how `` in touch '' they still are but in reality they have become completely canadian . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx_8knnjbbo ), 
  the relevant treaties just say that european countries can apply to join the eu but they do n't define `` european '' so it 's not possible to define any future extent . 
  according to the telegraph , dan carter of the french rugby union club racing 92 is on a salary of # 1.4 million . 
  that kenneth macalpin ( 810 to 858 ad ) was a king of the picts who became the first king of scots . 
  it 's very difficult to separate the real kenneth macalpin from the myth he became . 
  it 's crushed basalt rather than the crushed brick of a `` clay '' court . 
  people here generally do n't attempt to pronounce spanish names and words the same as spanish speakers would .
