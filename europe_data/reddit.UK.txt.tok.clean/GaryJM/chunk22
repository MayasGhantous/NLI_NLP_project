  starting a word with a / x / sound is unfamiliar for scottish people because we 're only used to having that sound in the middle or end of words , and english people often ca n't pronounce it at all !, 
  * one * is / w\u028cn / with the strut vowel from words like run , won or flood . 
  * wan * is / w\u0250\u031fn / with the trap vowel from words like lad , bad or cat . 
  these vowels might not be as different in your accent as they are for scottish speaker . 
  * juan * is usually pronounced / \u028d\u0250\u031fn / here . 
  seems like every week someone posts on / r/askuk about moving to dublin . 
  i 've had americans say they would n't consider me to be british because their image of britishness is , like you say , from the south of england . 
  but that 's where we get the name of scotland in scottish gaelic from - * alba . 
  we should re-brand the country with some more internationally-friendly names . 
  perhaps britannia for the uk , albion for great britain , anglia for england , caledonia for scotland , cambria for wales and nordhibernia for northern ireland ? 
   thousands of years of similar people co-existing , then totally different people with totally different values coming in , is different . 
  like when the celts arrived here with a different language and culture to the existing bronze age inhabitants ? 
  or when the romans came ? 
  or the anglo-saxons ? 
  or the vikings ? 
  or the normans ? 
  i was on the train to , uh , you know - that city on the tay ? 
  anyway , i was so bored i ended up reading the dictionary . 
  naw , i only got as far as `` c '' . 
  i 'll just wear a kilt . 
  if i ever visit then i shall practice saying * prihajam iz \u0160kotske . 
  i used to think it was :  scotland ? 
  is that in england ? 
  but i 've since learned that in many languages the word for `` united kingdom '' is very unfamiliar so many people are used to calling the uk `` england '' in their native language and carry this practice over when speaking english . 
  so , while it sounds wrong to me , it 's not as silly as it sounds . 
  americans do n't get to use this excuse though . 
  a glaswegian woman goes to the dentist and sits down in the chair . 
  '' , asks the dentist . 
  `` govan '' , she replies . 
  ***** how many spanish guys does it take to change a lightbulb ? 
  just juan . 
  ***** a man goes into a baker 's , points to the display and asks , `` it that a doughnut or a meringue ? '', 
  the baker replies , `` no , you 're right , it 's a doughnut . '', 
  ***** what do you call a man who has one foot inside his house and one foot outside ? 
  * ( short for * comfortable * ) sounds the same as * come fae ? 
  * ( meaning * come from ? 
  * ) so the dentist is asking if the woman is comfortable in the chair but she replies that she has come from govan , an area of glasgow . 
  * juan * sounds similar to * wan * - the word for the number * one * in some parts of scotland . 
  * a meringue * sounds the same as * am ah wrang * ( * am i wrong * ) so the baker thinks the customer is asking if he is mistaken or not . 
  * home * in scots is * hame * so someone who is partly-home could be called * hame-ish * which sounds the same as the name hamish . 
  second . 
  usa to usb , just to confuse people . 
  * tyler * is a very old name here - there 's a famous man named wat tyler who lived in the 14th century . 
  using it as a first name might be an american innovation though . 
  * lee * is also an old english surname that became a popular first name in the usa , apparently because of the popularity of robert e lee . 
  yeah , * sean * in ireland , * shane * in northern ireland and * ian * in scotland are all local variations of the norman name * jehan * aka * jean * aka * john . 
  niamh is from irish mythology so it 's probably unique to them . 
  siobhan is just one of the many forms of the latin name * ioanna , * such as joan , joanne , joanna , etc. 
  just english . 
  or scots too , if you count that . 
  i did 4 years of german at school but that was 20 years ago and i 've forgotten it . 
  i shall report this to the inquisition . 
   i see we have some heresy here to deal with . 
  do you ever read names like * ordo hereticus * and briefly wonder if you are reading bad italian ? 
  pretty popular here , possibly because games workshop are a british company . 
  my city has a games workshop shop on the high street and its also common to see gw miniatures for sale in general toy shops . 
  i have n't actually played the tabletop miniature game myself but a lot of my friends have . 
  they tried convincing me to play it but the cost put me off so we compromised and we 're going to play the rogue trader rpg . 
  bring on the eurovision swearing contest !, 
  [ in the uk  ( https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/relationships/birth-certificates-and-changing-your-name/changing-your-name )  there 's no legal way to change your name - you simply start using a new name . 
  it did n't seem to cause problems for pablo diego jos\u00e9 francisco de paula juan nepomuceno mar\u00eda de los remedios cipriano de la sant\u00edsima trinidad ruiz y picasso . 
  scotland vs england vs wales vs northern ireland is the biggest one , as divisions to do with language , literature , politics , cuisine , music , festivals , etc. 
  happen at this level . 
  within scotland , there 's a divide between the urbanised lowlands and the rural highlands and islands . 
  wales also has a divide between north and south , as does england , though there 's quite a bit of argument over who lives `` up north '' and who lives `` down south '' there  northern ireland has internal divisions too but i 'm not familiar with them and i suspect they 're complicated . 
  four elements are named after the same village in sweden : yttrium , erbium , terbium and ytterbium . 
  also , holmium is named after stockholm . 
  i have to confess that my city 's largest park was formerly an estate given to an admiral as a reward for defeating the dutch . 
  the battle took place near camperduin in north holland so his estate was called camperdown . 
  there 's a whole wikipedia article at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_linguistic_influence_on_naval_terms !, 
  did the dutch invent sailing or something ? 
  yep . 
  there do n't seem to be a lot of scots loanwords in english that are n't also words that scots borrowed from gaelic , such as * clan * or * glen * or * loch * or * trousers . 
  surprisingly , that was borrowed into irish from the english dialect word * crack * then borrowed back into english from irish as the loanword * craic . 
  i live in dundee and nobody ever speaks to me on the bus apart from auld jakies . 
  that 's true - i did not know that . 
  apparently this is down to a cultural aversion to getting into disagreements with strangers , which could be a dangerous situation to get into . 
  so there are certain `` permitted '' topics , such as the weather , which are fine because you ca n't really disagree on them . 
  i was on a train once which still had n't departed around twenty minutes after it was supposed to . 
  we all sat there in silence the whole time until an announcement was made apologising for the delay , at which point all the passengers launched into conversations along the lines of `` bloody typical !, 
  trains these days ! '', 
  and so on , as if we 'd suddenly been given permission . 
  that does n't sound so bad , since those were people in jobs that involved interacting with customers . 
  it 's more that striking up conversation with strangers in a lift or a queue can be rude as you 're seen as intruding on that person 's privacy . 
  apparently so  wikepedia says :  * delicatessen * is a german loanword which first appeared in english in 1889 and is the plural of * delikatesse . 
  * in german it was originally a french loanword , * d\u00e9licatesse , * meaning `` delicious things '' . 
  * kiosk * and * turquoise * are some other quite common english words that have turkish origins . 
  the british bren gun is named after the city of brno . 
  and where would we be without delicatessens , lager , abseiling , rucksacks , doppelgangers , neanderthals , noodles , poltergeists , schadenfreude , wanderlust , hinterland , ersatz things , kitsch things , etc. 
  a huge number of sailing terms in english are from dutch : avast ( hou ` vast ) , bow , buoy ( boei ) , commodore ( kommandeur ) , cruise ( kruisen ) , deck ( dec ) , dock ( docke ) , dredge ( dregghe ) , freebooter ( vrijbuiter ) , freight ( vracht ) , jib ( gijben ) , keelhaul ( kielhalen ) , scow ( schouw ) , shoal ( schole ) , skipper ( scipper ) , sloop ( sloep ) , smack ( smak ) , smuggler ( smokkelen ) and yacht ( jachtschip ) . 
  also lots of golfing terms like caddie and links . 
  we do want to talk to each other , it just is n't always appropriate . 
  it 's polite here to leave strangers alone , whereas in the us i think that would be seen as rude , as you would be seen as ignoring people . 
  there are certainly a huge number of brythonic names in it : duncan , alistair , moira , rowan , eamon , connor , loghain mac tir , kinloch hold ( [ we 've got the real one here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kinloch_castle ) ) , caer oswin ( welsh for `` castle oswin '' ) , etc. 
  there is no pomp , no bullshit and no frills . 
  yeah , i think that 's how we like to see ourselves . 
   poor devil !, 
  see him owre his trash ,  as feckless as a wither 'd rash ,  his spindle shank a guid whip-lash ,  his nieve a nit ;  thro bloody flood or field to dash ,  o how unfit !, 
   but mark the rustic , haggis-fed ,  the trembling earth resounds his tread ,  clap in his walie nieve a blade ,  he 'll make it whissle ;  an legs an arms , an heads will sned ,  like taps o thrissle . 
  which is to say that fancy food will make you feeble but plain , honest fare will give you the strength to chop off your enemy 's limbs .
