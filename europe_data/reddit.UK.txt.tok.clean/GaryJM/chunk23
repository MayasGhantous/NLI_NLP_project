  i think i get what you mean about the english - stiff upper lip , keep calm and carry on , must n't grumble , blitz spirit and so on . 
  what do you think defines the rest of the uk ? 
   i 'm a little confused as to why the uk and ireland would n't give eu rates to a citizen ? 
  i really thought that if you have an eu citizenship you get home rates ? 
  here in scotland , you can get your tuition fees paid for you if you are an eu citizen who has been living in the eea or switzerland for three years . 
  i do n't know , i 've never been to a church service . 
  i remember we had to say it every friday and there were a couple of years where i had a teacher that had us say it every day . 
  nope , just a regular nondenominational school . 
  he sold over fifteen million records here in the uk , had nine number one albums , nine number one singles and won many awards including the brit awards artist of a generation award and the mobo music awards lifetime achievement award . 
  so yeah , i 'd say he was the king of pop here too . 
  in the uk , you 'll only be asked to swear your allegiance if you take a position serving the crown in some way - such as legislators , judges , police officers , clergy , soldiers , marines and airmen - or if you become a naturalised citizen . 
  you 're generally expected to take your oath fairly seriously . 
  disloyalty to the crown is , of course , * high treason * though these days only a few things still count as treasonous , mainly to do with assassinating the monarch or certain senior members of the government . 
  there 's two types of school here in scotland : state and independent . 
  state schools are funded from taxes , comprehensive ( they accept anyone ) and run by local government . 
  independent schools are funded from tuition fees , selective ( they can admit pupils based on performance ) and run themselves . 
  most state schools are non-denominational but some are roman catholic . 
  i went to a non-denominational state school . 
  sadly , in my opinion , there 's no requirement for education to be secular here and in fact the opposite is true - schools are * required * to provide religious services . 
  for primary school ( ages 5 to 12 ) this was mostly hymn practice on thursday afternoons and `` assembly '' on friday mornings , which was a mix of hymns , a sermon and school news . 
  however for two years i had an especially religious teacher and the whole class had to recite the lord 's prayer every morning . 
  my school had something called [ the lord 's prayer . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord's_prayer ) you may have heard of it . 
  [ have you not seen a box of scott 's porrage oats ?

  perhaps they were going for * gro\u00dfgermanisches reich * but thought that most viewers would n't be familiar with that term so they stuck the word * nazi * in there ? 
  and then messed up the spelling , 
  thanks , it 's been a long time since i studied german !, 
  it 's a shame that they did n't get these little details right . 
  i have n't seen the programme but i 'd been thinking about watching it because i liked * ss-gb , * which is set in 1941 in a united kingdom which has been captured by the nazis after they successfully pulled off * unternehmen seel\u00f6we . 
  i 'm guessing it 's supposed to say * gr\u00f6\u00dfe * instead of * grobe * and * hauptmann * instead of * captain ? 
  if someone 's wearing a kilt then that 's usually a good indicator that they might be from the same country as me .

  [ the political compass website has gary johnson down as being as far to the right as possible , which in their system means he 's a proponent of as deregulated an economy as possible . ],

  [ wikipedia backs this up too . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_gary_johnson ) so it 's very surprising that the previous poster suggested you 'd be aligned with him politically . 
  [ on the other hand , there are n't really any libertarian-right parties in the uk ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/uk2015 ) so perhaps he meant you 're closer to gary johnson than to anyone else . 
  actually there 's a scottish libertarian party who stood for election in my region earlier this year and got a whopping 552 votes - 0.2 % of the total .

  hdi is calculated using three indices and each of those indices can be over 1 , which means that the final hdi can also be over 1 . 
  the life expectancy index is scaled from 0 ( life expectancy of 20 ) to 1 ( life expectancy of 85 ) . 
  if a country has a life expectancy of over 85 then its lei will be over 1 . 
  the education index is based on the mean years of schooling index and the expected years of schooling index . 
  mysi is 1 when people are in education for 15 years on average and eysi is 1 when people are expected to be in education for 18 years . 
  income index is 1 when gni per capita is $ 75,000 . 
  incomes over this will result in a ii of over 1 . 
  off the top of my head , i would guess that people in monaco earn more money than people in norway , hence their higher hdi score . 
  rich , tiny countries sort of break the income index though - it 's more for showing gross differences in standards of living . 
   btw . 
  is `` british '' also refering to uk-citizens living in northern ireland , or is there a different , correcter term in english `` british '' is the word used to describe something from the uk , so calling people from northern ireland `` british '' is correct . 
  many people from northern ireland do n't identity as british though , so it can be a touchy subject . 
  are british people speaking in german better off saying they are from * schottland * or * nordirland * or wherever , rather than using * vereinigtes k\u00f6nigreich ?

  if americans pronounce my country 's place names `` wrongly '' then i might gently correct them - `` it 's glaz-go , not glass-cow '' . 
  if you meant somewhere like versailles , kentucky then i suppose the american pronunciation might be a little counter-intuitive for french speakers but nobody 's going to complain .
