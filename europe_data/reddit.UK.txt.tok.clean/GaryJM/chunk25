  hmm , perhaps i should try one . 
  of course ; i chose those because they have websites that i could easily copy-and-paste a list of toppings from . 
  also , i 'd say their selection of toppings was quite representative . 
  there 's an italian pizzeria nearby that does * pizza quattro formaggi * but that seems like a specifically italian pizza to me , rather than a typical british pizza . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen salmon or artichoke on a pizza before . 
  [ i suspect haggis pizza is specific to just scotland . 
  ] ( http://cdn.backyardchickens.com/d/dd/dd800cae_haggispizza.jpeg ) i 'm not sure of any really local ones apart from that . 
  if a takeaway here does kebabs and pizza then they 'll happily combine the two for you , but i suspect that 's true for the rest of europe too . 
  unless france and italy have laws against that sort of gastronomic crime ? 
   edit : in the interests of comprehensiveness , the full list of toppings from my local domino 's pizza is : anchovies , chicken breast strips , chorizo sausage , cumberland sausage , domino 's herbs , garlic butter , green and red peppers , ground beef , ham , jalapeno peppers , mushrooms , pepperoni , pineapple , pork meatballs , red onions , sweet chilli peppers , smoked bacon rashers , sweetcorn , tandoori chicken , tomato , tuna . 
  from pizza hut it 's : anchovies , chicken , cajun chicken , crispy bacon , ham , pepperoni , seasoned minced beef , spicy pork , tuna , green chillies , jalape\u00f1os , mixed peppers , mushrooms , pineapple , red onions , sliced black olives , sweetcorn , tomato .

  sorry , i phrased that poorly . 
  i meant that i could n't tell the context of op 's story . 
  i took the question to be `` how would police in your country typically handle this situation '' . 
  yes , some tragic colossal fuck-up could occur , but i believe / u/19djafoij02 was asking about what 's standard procedure here . 
  i do n't know if the story he linked to is nearer that `` standard operating procedure '' end of the scale or the `` very rare fuck-up '' end . 
  a person walking around with a pistol here would definitely warrant a response from armed police , however i 'm pretty sure that merely holding a gun and refusing to drop it would not meet the criteria for the use of lethal force . 
  use of force here has to be proportionate and lethal force is only supposed to be used to prevent the imminent loss of life . 
  if the police in that story were able to ask the man ten times to drop his gun , it seems to me that they could just keep on asking him to drop his gun and eventually he 'd either comply or the situation would deteriorate and lethal force could be warranted . 
  [ there was an article in the wall street journal by an american who had found european service to be initially surprising and strange , but who had come to understand it  ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-defense-of-the-notoriously-arrogant-french-waiter-1424371178 )  at least part of the reason french waiters have such a bad reputation can be chalked up to cultural differences . 
  the french * gar\u00e7on de caf\u00e9 * will not hesitate to correct your pronunciation , for instance , because he thinks you want to pronounce things correctly . 
  he will not bring your check unless you ask him , because he considers it rude to intrude upon your party . 
  he may speak to you with what - particularly to american ears - appears to be impenetrable coolness , because he is there to serve you , not to be your pal . 
   unlike his american counterpart , a french waiter would never come curtsying up to your table to introduce himself : `` hi everyone , my name is johnny and i 'll be your server today !, 
  do you have any questions about the menu ? '', 
  ( nor would his respect for the ritual of the meal - and for the meal itself - permit him to ceaselessly interrupt diners to inquire `` and how is everything ? '' ), 
  i do n't think it 's so much american tipping that makes waitstaff seem overly-attentive to europeans , rather it 's the different politeness strategies that our cultures practice . 
  american society prefers * positive politeness * - emphasising closeness , belonging , friendliness and solidarity at the risk of being intrusive - and british society ( and europe in general , i think ) prefers * negative politeness * - minimising imposition and intrusion at the risk of seeming unfriendly . 
  no doubt you 've heard europeans complain about feeling imposed-upon when visiting the usa and , conversely , americans who feel they are being given the cold shoulder when visiting europe .

  jersey is part of the channel islands , an archipelago in the english channel . 
  the channel islands are not part of the uk but are instead crown dependencies . 
  they are self-governing but the uk is responsible for their defence and international relations . 
  the islands take part in the eu freedom of movement of goods but not labour , services or capital . 
  they are outside the vat area , but inside the customs union . 
  channel islanders are british citizens and hence european citizens . 
  as a result , they can travel freely within the eu , and all european citizens can travel to the islands without restrictions . 
  however , the islands do not participate in the freedom of movement of labour , and as a result their citizens are not entitled to work or reside within the eu unless they are directly connected ( through birth , or descent from a parent or grandparent ) with the united kingdom . 
  after five years continuous residence in the united kingdom , islanders are entitled to participate in the freedom of movement of labour or services throughout the eu . 
  there 's no customs fees when sending items between countries in the [ eu customs union , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_customs_union ) which is mostly the same as the eu except some eu territories are n't part of it ( such as gibraltar ) and some non-eu territories are part of it ( such as jersey ) .

  you need to pass an exam in order register with the nursing and midwifery council and you need to be registered with the nmc to work as a nurse here so , indirectly , it 's an exam that lets you get a work visa .

  it 's more that americans seem to dress in looser-fitting , more casual clothing than most europeans would do in a similar situation .
