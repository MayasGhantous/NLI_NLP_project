  trump is german now ? 
  that 's a relief !, 
  he 's been telling people he was scottish and we were getting fed up with that shit . 
  my condolences to the german people . 
  the american one . 
  i used to go to heavy metal clubs and american drinks like budweiser and jack daniels were popular because they had a `` rock 'n' roll '' image . 
  drinks like scotch whisky and scotch ale were seen as old-fashioned and something your parents would drink , and therefore uncool . 
  sorry for the snarky response before but i really did n't recognise what you were talking about . 
  what i hear from my government is that the uk * is * increasing military spending - [ detailed here ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-budget-increases-for-the-first-time-in-six-years ) - but that 's generally considered an attempt to balance out underspending in previous years , not at attempt at a military build-up . 
  i already mentioned that [ our frigates and destroyers will have almost no anti-ship capability ] ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/16/royal_navy_harpoon_missile_2018_withdrawal_no_replacement ) but [ we 're also going to have american planes operating from our new carrier because we wo n't have enough planes of our own . 
  ] ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/09/usmc_will_fly_f35s_on_hms_queen_elizabeth_first_op_deployment ) i have n't seen any signs of a european arms race though if donald trump continues to [ suggest that the us might not come to the aid of its military allies ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/us/politics/donald-trump-issues.html?_r=0 ) then a beefed-up eu army could well be the result . 
  [ the spear-danes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness . 
  we have heard of those princes ' heroic campaigns . 
  sorry about that but i think op is hinting that the us is going to withdraw its military presence from the uk and we all know what that means - a return to the days of viking raids . 
  our only hope of holding the vikings off is if they know we have bagpipes and we 're prepared to use them . 
  [ we 've got scarier things than muskets . 
  i did n't know we were rearming , in fact the story that 's in the news at the moment is [ `` uk warships to have less firepower than 19th century equivalents as missiles withdrawn '' .

  i would say that bodybuilding has actually become quite mainstream , at least here in the uk . 
  i see protein powders and things like that in supermarkets now , where you used to only see them in specialty shops . 
  i think the appeal here is that it 's a bit of americana , rather than anything to do with the taste . 
  bottled budweiser used to be strangely popular here , purely down to marketing and it being seen as `` cool '' . 
  edit : bring on the downvotes , people who thought they were cool drinking bottles of budweiser in the nineties . 
   plus why do they all look homeless ? 
  [ hey mister / i wan na know-oh / are you a hipster ? 
  / or a hobo ?

  the opposite - [ they make a big deal out of being made with cane sugar ] ( https://www.boylanbottling.com/product-category/cane-sugar ) - which , of course , is n't a selling point outside of the usa . 
  there 's a restaurant in town that serves artisanal pizza , vintage american sodas and craft beer , so ... 
  i live in a city of 150,000 and we have seventeen conservation areas in the city . 
  i 've no idea how typical that is though . 
  i would have guessed that we were * less * historical than other cities due to how often we were sacked . 
  i suppose that might be what op meant , though it 's very odd to hear theresa may referred to as the president of the uk . 
  if i asked who was the king of your country you might answer `` barack obama '' since he 's the equivalent but it still sounds strange , no ? 
  four out of six is pretty good  angela merkel is the chancellor ( the head of government ) and not the president ( the head of state ) . 
  theresa may is the prime minister ( the head of government ) and the uk does n't use `` president '' for our head of state , we use `` queen '' ( at the moment ) . 
  cyprus has a full presidential system , where the president is both head of state and head of government . 
  belarus has a full presidential system but with a prime minister appointed by the president . 
  lithuania , portugal , romania , russia , ukraine and france have semi-presidential systems , where the president and prime minister both have political power . 
  albania , austria , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , czech republic , estonia , finland , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , ireland , italy , latvia , macedonia , malta , moldova , montenegro , poland , serbia , slovakia and slovenia are parliamentary republics , where the prime minister is head of government and a ceremonial ( to a greater or lesser extent ) president is head of state . 
  so , all those countries have some sort of president . 
  the other european countries either have a prime minister and a ceremonial monarch ( andorra , belgium , denmark , luxembourg , netherlands , norway , spain , sweden , uk ) or a prime minister and an active monarch ( liechtenstein and monaco ) or an absolute monarch ( the vatican ) or captains regent ( san marino ) or a federal council ( switzerland ) . 
  hong kong , the place with government-operated hospitals ? 
  what would an actually capitalist country look like to you ? 
  if `` socialism '' is just capitalism with welfare then the uk 's been a socialist state since the early 20th century and all our political parties - even our right-wing ones - are socialist . 
  the definition in collins dictionary is pretty good :  an economic theory or system in which the means of production , distribution , and exchange are owned by the community collectively , usually through the state . 
  it is characterized by production for use rather than profit , by equality of individual wealth , by the absence of competitive economic activity , and , usually , by government determination of investment , prices , and production levels . 
  contrast this with :  an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production , distribution , and exchange , characterized by the freedom of capitalists to operate or manage their property for profit in competitive conditions . 
  if you look at an actual socialist party , such as the scottish socialist party , you see policies to do with nationalising industries . 
  they sure do but what do any of those things have to do with socialism ? 
  how prevalent are vampires in romania ? 
   snp are a nationalist socialist organization . 
  oh , you 're just here to troll . 
  it sounds like you want your boyfriend to request an invitation for you and have that sent to the russian embassy ( or consulate ) in the country where you 're staying . 
  the embassy ( or consulate ) staff will then interview you and issue you a `` homestay visa '' . 
  hey , i 'm not anti-birth , 
  so where would a party like the scottish national party fit into your system ? 
  at the moment they 're part of the greens -- european free alliance . 
  edit : i also was n't aware that everyone was unhappy with the current organisation of political parties but then i do n't follow european parliament politics very closely . 
  i support abortion being legal for anyone that wants it . 
  i do n't like the terms * pro-choice * and * pro-life * because surely everybody is pro-life . 
  only 7 % of people surveyed in 2013 wanted abortion to be banned in the uk and i doubt that figure has risen since then . 
  i do n't know what the situation is like in other countries , but organising political parties along the lines of which ethnic minorities they appeal to is bizarre to me . 
  indians make up a whopping 0.62 % of the population of scotland , chinese people make up 0.64 % , black people make up 0.12 % ( though many of the 0.56 % of people who identify as african will also be black ) . 
  gypsies make up 0.08 % , muslims make up 1.4 % and jews make up 0.1 % . 
  these numbers are so small that there are no political parties here that go out of their way to appeal to these groups . 
  alastair , andrew , angus , calum , donald , douglas , duncan , ewan , gordon , hamish , ian , kenneth , malcolm , neil , ross , fiona , lorna , morven , rhona ... 
  i suppose it 's possible that one day the uk could have a head of state who inherited their position and who was also the head of the state religion . 
  you 'd be amazed how rarely i hear people speaking either language . 
  i can tell different branches of the indo-european language family apart but not the languages within those branches : balto-slavic vs celtic vs germanic vs hellenic vs italic . 
  within branches , i could distinguish north germanic ( icelandic , faroese , norwegian , swedish and danish ) from west germanic ( scots , english , frisian , dutch and german ) but i could n't distinguish languages closer than that , apart from scots and english . 
  my sister and her husband used to work at a hotel in [ aviemore , ] ( http://www.visitaviemore.com ) in the scottish highlands , and there 's lots of christmas and hogmanay ( new year ) stuff that goes on there . 
  [ there 's a new one just out , featuring butteries .

  i 'm surprised nobody 's mentioned the european union 's only official semitic language :  ma nitkellimx bil-malti tajjeb . 
  if you can call a european trip that does n't visit kirkcaldy `` fine '' . 
  you do n't gain british citizenship by marrying a british person . 
  i ca n't believe i forgot macaroni pie !, 
  apparently 24 % of people in kentucky told the census that they had german ancestry . 
  ironically , an american product - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beer_cheese_ ( spread ), 
  i think many cultures have an `` urgh , i 'm hungover and need to make something so i 'll just mash all the leftovers together and cook that '' dish  enjoy tattie scones as part of [ this complete scottish breakfast . 
  ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/f3/2f/52/the-wheelhouse.jpg ), 
  cheese beer . 
  not necessarily my favourites but some very funny videos about making traditional scottish foods : - [ brose ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqb95mp18l8 ) - a type of oat porridge . 
  - [ oatcakes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dysgvpgpq3c ) - a flatbread made from , unsurprisingly , oats . 
  - [ stovies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmqp_ra-nbo ) - leftover meat , potatoes and vegetables . 
  - [ shortbread ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kd_a0mytlc ) - a type of biscuit [ cookie ] . 
  scotland 's biggest food company is a shortbread maker so i would n't be surprised if you 've had this one . 
  - [ tattie scones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sylkyveyl9g ) - a griddle scone made from mashed potatoes . 
  - [ cranachan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2piuurrwtwa ) - a dessert made from toasted oatmeal , whisky , cream , honey and fruit . 
  - [ cullen skink ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb4yquy4i0w ) - a soup made with smoked haddock . 
  - [ clootie dumpling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un-te24x5vq ) - a fruit pudding . 
  as for a favourite , i 'd say [ tablet , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgotmbavflg ) which is a fudge-like confection made from sugar , condensed milk and butter ( and whisky , if you 're into that sort of thing ) . 
  i think it 's from the pejorative work sense - `` powder monkey '' for a boy who transported gunpowder on a warship , `` grease monkey '' for a mechanic , `` phone monkey '' for a call centre worker and so on . 
  so `` surrender monkey '' suggests people whose profession is surrendering . 
  that 's for people subject to immigration control ; is that likely to affect op ? 
  i 've seen the cgp grey videos about it - [ `` how the electoral college works '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ous9mm8xbbw ) and [ `` the trouble with the electoral college '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wc42hgla4k ) and it does seem like a crazy system but it 's hard for me to be too critical considering there 's also a cgp grey video called [ `` why the uk election results are the worst in history .
