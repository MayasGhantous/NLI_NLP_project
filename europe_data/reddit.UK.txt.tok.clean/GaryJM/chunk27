  seeing as same-sex marriage is n't legal in northern ireland , it makes a difference  to get married in england ( or wales or scotland ) you need a [ marriage visitor visa ] ( https://www.gov.uk/marriage-visa/overview ) it 's pretty much just a standard visitor visa that also allows you to get married so you just need to meet the conditions for visiting here ( able to support yourself during your stay and no indications that you intend to over-stay ) and the conditions for getting married ( over 18 and in a genuine relationship ) . 
  i do n't know how these things work in ireland , i 'm afraid . 
  edit : i think you 'll have to give [ fifteen day 's notice ] ( https://www.gov.uk/marriages-civil-partnerships/giving-notice-at-your-local-register-office ) of your intention to marry . 
  there 's a piece of legislation that the scottish parliament are currently trying to get abolished , called the offensive behaviour at football act . 
  this law was an attempt to crack down on sectarian abuse at football matches but has been criticised for being too much of a limit on free speech . 
  i 'm no fan of sectarianism by any means but you 'll probably agree that this :  a person commits an offence if they are engaging in behaviour at a regulated football match that a reasonable person would be likely to consider offensive and would be likely to incite public disorder but for the fact that persons likely to be incited to public disorder are not present . 
  ... is a little far-reaching . 
  us scots will never know the joy of shouting `` get orf moi land ! '', 
  at people . 
  scotland has two national parks , though national parks here are n't like they are in other countries . 
  yosemite national park , for example , is rated `` iucn category ii '' :  a national park is similar to a wilderness area in its size and its main objective of protecting functioning ecosystems . 
  however , national parks tend to be more lenient with human visitation and its supporting infrastructure . 
  national parks are managed in a way that may contribute to local economies through promoting educational and recreational tourism on a scale that will not reduce the effectiveness of conservation efforts . 
  ... whereas scotland 's two national parks are category v :  a protected landscape or protected seascape covers an entire body of land or ocean with an explicit natural conservation plan , but usually also accommodates a range of for-profit activities . 
   the main objective is to safeguard regions that have built up a distinct and valuable ecological , biological , cultural , or scenic character . 
  in contrast with previous categories , category v permits surrounding communities to interact more with the area , contributing to the area 's sustainable management and engaging with its natural and cultural heritage . 
   landscapes and seascapes that fall into this category should represent an integral balance between people and nature and can sustain activities such as traditional agricultural and forestry systems on conditions that ensure the continued protection or ecological restoration of the area . 
  basically , your national parks are government-owned protected wilderness areas that the public can visit and ours are just areas of the country that have extra environmental regulation . 
  i think the situation in england and wales is similar . 
  northern ireland does n't have any national parks at the moment . 
  i do n't know what the situation is in ireland and i 'd guess the other british isles do n't have room for anything like a national park . 
  it would make sense that the us would n't need `` right to roam '' laws , since you are n't short of public wilderness to visit . 
  we do n't have that here though - if people here were able to put up `` no trespassing '' signs then you 'd scarcely be able to anywhere in the countryside . 
  yes . 
  from looking at wikipedia , the only places in europe that have higher limits are : - finland - 20 for purchasing drinks over 23 % abv in a shop - iceland - 20 for all alcohol purchases - norway - 20 for purchasing drinks over 22 % abv - sweden - 20 for purchasing drinks over 3.5 % abv in shops, 
   camping is illegal in the uk unless it is done with the permission of the landowner . 
  sorry , this just is n't true in scotland , though it is for the rest of the uk . 
  from http://www.outdooraccess-scotland.com/practical-guide/public/camping - `` access rights extend to wild camping . '', 
  yeah , i think it was just supposed to be a `` fun '' question but i can see how it would be frustrating . 
  there 's a feeling here that scotland , in a sense , belongs to everyone . 
  you might own that mountain or that river but that does n't mean you get to exclude everyone else from using it . 
  everyone here has the right to be on and cross land and inland waterways for recreational purposes , with some exceptions . 
  `` recreational purposes '' is n't defined in the law but is commonly taken to mean activities like walking , camping , cyling , horse riding , canoeing , etc. 
  the exceptions are : - you do n't have the right to access buildings or temporary shelters ( such as tents ) and you do n't have the right to access land if it would `` unreasonably disturb '' the occupants of a building . 
  so you 're not going to see people kicking a football around in your back yard , it 's more about people canoeing on your river or walking in your woods or camping by your lake . 
  - you do n't have the right to access sports fields or places where admittance is normally charged - you do n't have the right to access land where there are building or demolition works taking place , where there is quarrying taking place or where crops are growing . 
  edit : you 're also not allowed to camp somewhere permanently , only temporarily , but i do n't think the law specifies a particular duration . 
  `` do n't take the piss '' , basically . 
  edit 2 : oh yeah , you ca n't go on military bases or airfields either . 
  i ca n't imagine op expects people here to be familiar with every law in the us though , so presumably his question was `` what 's something that 's legal where you live but you 've heard is n't legal in the us ? '', 
  if the question was `` what 's something that 's legal everywhere in your country and illegal everywhere in the us ? '', 
  then my answer would have been that ( a ) i do n't know every law in the us and ( b ) i do n't know every law in the uk . 
  looks like i 'm a bit behind the times . 
  when i was wee , under-14 's were n't allowed in pubs , though accompanied over-14 's were . 
  then , in 1990 , pubs could start applying for a * children 's certificate * that let them admit young children . 
  apparently the rules changed again in 2009 and now it 's down to local authorities what rules they put in place when they grant a licence to a venue . 
   i do n't think you were looking for that sort of stuff . 
  i assumed so too , otherwise we would have lots of answers like `` having a parliament '' or `` having a monarchy '' or `` having a state religion '' . 
  are children in the usa generally allowed into bars ? 
  in scotland ~ ~ they are n't , unless the pub has applied for special permission ~ ~ it depends on your local government . 
  in austria ( i think ) children generally are allowed in bars . 
  can you blame people in the uk for thinking there 's a crime called * jaywalking * when one of the first hits on google for `` jaywalking '' is an article called [ `` jailed for jaywalking '' ] ( http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/jailed-jaywalking-pedestrian-crime-lands-some-behi/137878898 ) from an atlanta news station ? 
   williams said the officer rushed toward her , demanded she stop and handcuffed her . 
  williams explained what he said to her next , `` well , you 're about to go to jail for violating georgia 's jaywalking laws . '' i mean , if you say jaywalking 's not a crime in the us then i 'll withdraw my comment but it seems to be a pretty confusing topic . 
  we get the idea that it 's illegal to cross the street in the usa in the wrong place because of stories like [ this article on the bbc news website  ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6251431.stm )  it is a cautionary tale for any traveller - distinguished historian felipe fernandez-armesto tried to cross the road while in atlanta for the conference of the american historical association , only to find himself in handcuffs and surrounded by armed police . 
   `` i come from a country where you can cross the road where you like , '' said the visiting professor of global environmental history at queen mary college , university of london . 
  `` it had n't occurred to me that i was n't allowed to cross the road between the two main conference venues . '', 
  - crossing a road on foot wherever you like ( with the exception of motorways ) - accessing private land for recreational purposes without the owner 's permission - purchasing alcohol at age 18 - traditionally-made haggis - having the same head of state for the past 64 years, 
  scottish people can sort-of speak privately abroad by getting `` more scottish '' but we run the risk of accidentally saying something that makes sense in another germanic language . 
  you 'll ask a fellow scot , `` ken the kirk by ma hoose ? '', 
  and a danish person will have little trouble eavesdropping on your conversation . 
  i 'm not sure when the christmas music starts but i can tell you that my city 's christmas celebrations start on the 18th of november when the christmas lights are switched on - no waiting around for the start of advent here . 
  i 'd support anyone getting asylum here if they meet the criteria : https://www.gov.uk/claim-asylum/eligibility, 
  in english , some nationalities have the same word for both the noun and adjective form and some do n't . 
  i 'm afraid there 's no rule . 
  you could say `` as a german '' or `` as an italian '' but you could n't say `` as a french '' or `` as an irish '' , you would have to say * french person * or * irish person . 
  i 'm just impressed anyone 's even heard of scots . 
  for the uk : 1 . 
  the adjective is * british . 
  a person is a * briton * though you 're more likely to hear * british person . 
  the most common language spoken is called * english . 
  * for scotland : 1 . 
  the adjective is * scottish . 
  * it used to be * scotch * but this is now considered old-fashioned , however it is still used in names such as * scotch whisky . 
  * it 's better to use * scottish * than * scotch * if you 're unsure . 
  a person from scotland is a * scot . 
  * there are also the gendered forms * scotsman * and * scotswoman . 
  english is the most widely-spoken langauge but there is also a germanic language called * scots , * which is not to be confused with * scottish gaelic , * which is a celtic language . 
  we just capitalise the first letter of a surname , except for gaelic surnames like mcdonald or o'brien . 
   is this not just another word for cheater or adulterer ? 
  yes , though it 's the sort of word you only really see in tabloid newspapers . 
   does this concept not exist in the uk ? 
  from the blog :  condo ( minium ) ` building consisting of residential units that are individually owned ' or ` an individually-owned unit within such a building ' . 
  in ame condo generally contrasts with apartment ( building ) - the former is rented , the latter owned . 
  in uk , they 're called ( blocks of ) flats regardless of owned/rented status . 
  speaking of untranslatable words , lynne murphy at the * separated by a common language * released her sixth annual list of things that there 's a word for in british english but not american , and vice versa . 
  british : - rough sleeper - busman 's holiday - to give a backie - love rat - glamour model american : - to t-bone - to kick the tires - candy-striper - big box store - condo, 
  primarily local , from what i can remember . 
  my ex-girlfriend went to school in the north of england and she learned a lot about the roman occupation of britain , visited roman sites and so on . 
  whereas i never learned anything about the romans but i did learn a lot about urbanisation and the industrial revolution because those were more important up here . 
  if i 'd opted to take history from age 15 then it would become more scholarly study , so i would have been covering world history in more depth . 
  i took geography instead and there 's quite a jump from doing it at ages 13 to 14 , when you 're just there to learn , and doing it at ages 15 and 16 when you have exams to pass at the end . 
  i 'm sure we covered lots of things but all i can remember at this point is that we learned about life in the uk during ww2 in primary 7 and we covered the wars of scottish independence in early secondary school . 
  i remember we visited bannockburn and stirling castle . 
  i only took history up to age 14 . 
  bear grylls is a good choice but i 'd go for [ sir ranulph fiennes . 
  he had a sword but it was a * claybeg * - a small sword . 
  i thought you might have gone for cheick guillaume ouedraogo , a parisian kickboxer who [ came back from the dead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jebj6rduibq ) during a mixed martial arts fight . 
  lieutenant-colonel john malcolm thorpe fleming `` mad jack '' churchill :  churchill resumed his commission after germany invaded poland in september 1939 . 
  as part of the british expeditionary force to france , in may 1940 churchill and his unit , the manchester regiment , ambushed a german patrol near l'\u00c9pinette ( near richebourg in the pas-de-calais ) , france .
