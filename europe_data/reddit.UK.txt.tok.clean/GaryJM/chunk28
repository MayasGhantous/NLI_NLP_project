  churchill gave the signal to attack by cutting down the enemy feldwebel ( sergeant ) with a barbed arrow , becoming the only british soldier known to have felled an enemy with a longbow in wwii . 
   jack churchill was second in command of no . 
  3 commando in operation archery , a raid on the german garrison at v\u00e5gs\u00f8y , norway , on 27 december 1941 . 
  as the ramps fell on the first landing craft , churchill leapt forward from his position playing `` march of the cameron men '' on his bagpipes , before throwing a grenade and running into battle in the bay . 
  when you discover steel , the quote is :  `` before that steam drill shall beat me down , i 'll die with my hammer in my hand . '', 
  which is a lyric from the song * john henry , the steel-driving man . 
  * edit : he 's also referenced in civ v :  john henry said to his captain : a man ai n't nothin ' but a man , / and before i 'll let your steam drill beat me down , / i 'll die with the hammer in my hand .

   if something is # 100 , then # 20 of that will go to the government . 
  good post but i just have to correct your maths here . 
  if something costs # 100 including vat then that means the pre-tax price must be # 83.33 since the tax is 20 % of the pre-tax price and 20 % of # 83.33 is # 16.67 and # 83.33 plus # 16.67 adds up to # 100 . 
  never thought i 'd see an american correct a canadian for trying to correct a norwegian for using british english , 
  i live in a suburb in scotland and since i recently learned that * suburb * means different things in british and american english , i should clarify that i mean :  a residential district situated on the outskirts of a city or town and not :  a smaller community adjacent to or within commuting distance of a city i 've never learned to drive so i get around mainly by walking and busses and occasionally by cycling . 
  for everyday groceries like bread , milk , etc. 
  i walk to a `` corner shop '' . 
  there 's one 0.2 miles away and another 0.3 miles away . 
  for the rest of my grocery shopping i go to a supermarket that 's 0.5 miles away . 
  i tend to get a monthly delivery of the heavy items and only visit the shop a few times a month . 
  for my bank , post office , coffee shops , pubs , restaurants , railway station , etc. 
  i walk to my suburb 's high street , which is 1 mile away . 
  for anything else i get the bus into the city centre , which takes around 15 minutes . 
  i do n't do much shopping there these days as it 's almost always easier and cheaper to order things online and have them delivered . 
  pretty much the way you just did : lawn , driveway , flowerbeds , patio , deck , etc. 
  edit : the first meaning of [ * garden * ] ( http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/garden ) in collins dictionary is :  an area of land , usually planted with grass , trees , flowerbeds , etc , adjoining a house . 
  * us and canadian word : * yard,

  wikipedia claims that the british isles has `` over six thousand '' islands so the figure for the uk will be less , though i ca n't find that particular figure . 
  there are figures for just the number of * inhabited * islands : 267 for the british isles , of which 124 are in the uk . 
  i 'll keep an eye out for vikings . 
  i 've been to great britain , the isle of wight and lindisfarne . 
  i live on great britain , got a ferry to the isle of wight and drove across a causeway to lindisfarne . 
  i think japan would be my top pick , especially the sengoku period ( as seen in the novel * shogun * and the * shogun : total war * games ) and the mid-19th century ( as seen in the film * the last samurai * and the * fall of the samurai * game ) . 
  also , while not being a fan of classic westerns , i have recently enjoyed the tv series * westworld * and the game * hard west , * and have had my interest in the american old west piqued . 
  ouch !, 
  i went to malta in january and loved it because it was like a warm scottish summer day , around 20 degrees . 
  the locals were all in their winter clothes and we must have looked a bit strange in our shorts and t-shirts and sunglasses . 
  i like the temperature where i live - not too hot in summer ( average high is 20 degrees ) and not too cold in winter ( average low is 1 degree and it rarely snows ) . 
  the thing i do n't like is the lack of sunshine - only 1,426 annual hours and while the summer days can be amazingly long ( the sun is up from 0420 to 2200 at midsummer ) the winter nights are awful . 
  the sun was only up for 9 hours and 20 minutes today and by midwinter it will be down to 6 hours and 50 minutes . 
  not exactly arctic but still a bit grim .

  for the uk , the visa you want is called the standard visitor visa and you can apply for one [ here . 
  ] ( https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/uk-visit-visa ) you need to be able to show that : - you intend to return home after your visit ( evidence of having a job you need to return to would work well ) - you are able to support yourself during your visit ( copies of bank statements would work for this purpose ) - you are able to pay for your journey home ( having a return ticket would help ) if your documents are n't in english then you will need to get english translations done . 
  i think you and your girlfriend will be able to apply as a couple so that you can show you are able to support both of you . 
  edit : there 's a sub at / r/ukvisa / that can help you . 
  plus , if the flag changed every time new member states joined then we 'd have had eight different flags in sixty-four years - an average of a flag change every eight years . 
  wales , you say ? 
  nope , does n't ring any bells . 
  hard to say ; i 've spoken to americans who are serious anglophiles and know a lot about the uk and i 've spoken to some who know very little . 
  they all seem have at least heard of us though , so ... 1 to 4 on your scale ? 
  worldwide ... again , hard to say . 
  generally no , but there was a competition for reciting the poetry of robert burns that you could enter , which would have required learning a poem by heart . 
  oh aye , if only americans could have the healthy eating habits of us scots . 
  sorry about that . 
  i 'm afraid it 's so common on reddit to see people with a woeful grasp of british geography that i tend to assume the worst . 
  well i am british and i live in the uk , i 'm just not english . 
  yeah . 
  not that i ever play as england . 
  nothing against the english , mind you , i just generally prefer other civs . 
  played some civ v earlier , trying to conquer the world with my awe-inspiring french artworks . 
  harder to carry a pumpkin lantern around with you though  which is why kids do n't bother anymore , i suppose . 
  cool  there are a few things like that here , such as [ this joust being held at linlithgow palace .

  the price of freddos ? 
  the uk leaving the european union is the biggest issue at the moment , closely followed by a possible second referendum on scottish independence . 
  healthcare is a big issue here , though the arguments are over different things than in the us . 
  there was an article in the guardian ( newspaper ) today complaining about a lack of nhs services for people with mental health problems . 
  there are also stories in the news about whether funding should be cut for treatments that some doctors consider `` unhelpful '' and if nhs england 's plan to replace its radiotherapy machines is the best use of its budget . 
  if your `` renaissance fair '' really is set during the renaissance then serving turkey is plausible ; if it 's more of a medieval fair then yes , they would be anachronistic . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't have permission to view your photos . 
  the traditional parts of the holiday that i grew up with , such as guising and turnip lanterns , seem to have been replaced by their american versions - trick-or-treating and pumpkin lanterns . 
  what about a nice bit of swan ? 
  aww , you 've shattered my illusions  i was picturing a fair where americans strolled around appreciating elizabethan plays and reproductions of the works of raphael and botticelli before sitting down to a lovely meal of boiled pigeon , manchet bread and small beer . 
  yes , the renaissance period is n't quite as exciting when you have a house on your street that 's older than it , 
  i 've never heard of one here . 
  there are festivals for individual aspects of culture from that period , such as the works of william shakespeare or performances of madrigals or an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts , but i 'm not familiar with any festivals that try and cover the whole period . 
  also , while the flowering of literature , art and philosophy that took place during the renaissance is certainly important , it 's not terribly exciting to us - if we 're going to re-enact history , we prefer [ vikings ] ( http://www.jorvik-viking-festival.co.uk ) to poets . 
  edit : there 's plenty of real art and architecture from that period still around that you can see . 
  there 's some correlation between wealth and social class here but a person of any financial status can be any social class . 
  the right honourable the lord sugar , for example , is the 95th-richest person in the country and a peer of the realm and yet describes himself as `` a working-class jewish boy from the east end '' . 
  conversely , there are plenty of impoverished aristocrats who do n't stop being upper-class just because they 've been bankrupted by the costs of trying to maintain the family home .

  you wo n't get an overview of the whole of europe but you 'll be too full of whisky to care . 
  do you normally call it the moose ( rather than the elk ) in english , or was that just for op 's benefit ?

  for the first one , the british words that were strangest to americans were : punter , kettling , secondment , skiving , git , jobsworth , oi , naff , jammy , oo-err missus , taking the piss , moreish , ropey , lurgy , faff and gutted . 
  the american words that were strangest to british people were : pork ( as in government spending ) , trailer trash , snit , jonesing , rain check , potluck , nickel-and-dimed , hazing , to nix , from soup to nuts , inside baseball , mugwump , one-oh-one and squeaker .

  no sandwiches involved . 
  callum is probably very popular but `` an absolute ledge '' means he is `` legendary '' for some reason . 
  which does n't mean he 's mythical , rather that he is famous ( or infamous ) in his social circles for something , perhaps drinking a legendary amount of booze .
