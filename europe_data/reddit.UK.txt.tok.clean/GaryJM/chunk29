  `` archbishop of banterbury '' is a play on the words `` banter '' and the archbishop of canterbury , the church of england 's most senior bishop . 
  it means someone who is good at banter , as if they had somehow reached a senior position in an organisation that was involved in banter . 
  `` cheeky '' in this context does n't mean sarcastic but something more like `` illicit , but not really '' . 
  you might go for a `` cheeky pint '' at lunchtime , suggesting you 're doing something that 's the tiniest bit naughty . 
  it might be related to our slightly odd relationship with treating ourselves . 
  the american author bill bryson wrote :  [ the british ] are the only people in the world who think of jam and currents as thrilling constituents of a pudding or cake . 
  offer them something genuinely tempting - a slice of gateau or a choice of chocolates from a box - and they will nearly always hesitate and begin to worry that it 's unwarranted and excessive , as if any pleasure beyond a very modest threshold is vaguely unseemly . 
   ` oh , i must n't really , ' they say . 
   ` oh , go on , ' you prod encouragingly . 
   ` well , just a small one then , ' they say and dartingly take a small one , and then get a look as if they have just done something terribly devilish . 
  i think `` let 's smash it '' just suggests doing something `` to the max '' rather than literal destruction . 
  you did pretty well though , considering the text is deliberately meant to be hard-to-understand . 
  i 'll be lazy and just mention our unesco world heritage sites : - ** heart of neolithic orkney ** - the group of neolithic monuments on orkney consists of a large chambered tomb ( maes howe ) , two ceremonial stone circles ( the stones of stenness and the ring of brodgar ) and a settlement ( skara brae ) , together with a number of unexcavated burial , ceremonial and settlement sites . 
  the group constitutes a major prehistoric cultural landscape which gives a graphic depiction of life in this remote archipelago in the far north of scotland some 5,000 years ago . 
  - ** st kilda ** - this volcanic archipelago , with its spectacular landscapes , is situated off the coast of the hebrides and comprises the islands of hirta , dun , soay and boreray . 
  it has some of the highest cliffs in europe , which have large colonies of rare and endangered species of birds , especially puffins and gannets . 
  the archipelago , uninhabited since 1930 , bears the evidence of more than 2,000 years of human occupation in the extreme conditions prevalent in the hebrides . 
  human vestiges include built structures and field systems , the cleits and the traditional highland stone houses . 
  they feature the vulnerable remains of a subsistence economy based on the products of birds , agriculture and sheep farming . 
  - ** frontiers of the roman empire ** - the ` roman limes ' represents the border line of the roman empire at its greatest extent in the 2nd century ad . 
  it stretched over 5,000 km from the atlantic coast of northern britain , through europe to the black sea , and from there to the red sea and across north africa to the atlantic coast . 
  the remains of the limes today consist of vestiges of built walls , ditches , forts , fortresses , watchtowers and civilian settlements . 
  certain elements of the line have been excavated , some reconstructed and a few destroyed . 
  the two sections of the limes in germany cover a length of 550 km from the north-west of the country to the danube in the south-east . 
  the 118-km-long hadrian 's wall ( uk ) was built on the orders of the emperor hadrian c. ad 122 at the northernmost limits of the roman province of britannia . 
  it is a striking example of the organization of a military zone and illustrates the defensive techniques and geopolitical strategies of ancient rome . 
  the antonine wall , a 60-km long fortification in scotland was started by emperor antonius pius in 142 ad as a defense against the `` barbarians '' of the north . 
  it constitutes the northwestern-most portion of the roman limes . 
  - ** new lanark ** - new lanark is a small 18th - century village set in a sublime scottish landscape where the philanthropist and utopian idealist robert owen moulded a model industrial community in the early 19th century . 
  the imposing cotton mill buildings , the spacious and well-designed workers ' housing , and the dignified educational institute and school still testify to owen 's humanism . 
  - ** old and new towns of edinburgh ** - edinburgh has been the scottish capital since the 15th century . 
  it has two distinct areas : the old town , dominated by a medieval fortress ; and the neoclassical new town , whose development from the 18th century onwards had a far-reaching influence on european urban planning . 
  the harmonious juxtaposition of these two contrasting historic areas , each with many important buildings , is what gives the city its unique character . 
  - ** the forth bridge ** - this railway bridge , crossing the forth estuary in scotland , had the world 's longest span ( 541 m ) when it opened in 1890 . 
  it remains one of the greatest cantilever trussed bridges and continues to carry passengers and freight . 
  its distinctive industrial aesthetic is the result of a forthright and unadorned display of its structural components . 
  innovative in style , materials and scale , the forth bridge marks an important milestone in bridge design and construction during the period when railways came to dominate long-distance land travel .

  you can buy it on amazon if you can bring yourself to pay # 14.47 for 6 litres . 
  it 's chinotto juice with herbs and spices . 
  i found it to be more like a herbal drink ( perhaps dandelion and burdock ) than a fruit one . 
  i tried [ kinnie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kinnie ) while on holiday in malta and it was the strangest-tasting drink i 've ever had . 
  likewise , i 'm scottish and have been to england many times as it 's very easy to get the train down but i 've never been to wales or northern ireland . 
  exercise tiger , i think . 
  i remembered that scotland has had its own poet laureate since 2004 so they would be a good place to start . 
  - [ edwin morgan ] ( http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poets/edwin-morgan ) - [ liz lochhead ] ( http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poets/liz-lochhead ) - [ jackie kay ] ( http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poets/jackie-kay ), 
  robert burns is widely considered to be scotland 's national poet . 
  his birthday is still celebrated with dinners called burns suppers where his poetry is recited , most famously his * address to a haggis : *  fair fa ' your honest , sonsie face ,  great chieftain o ' the puddin-race !, 
  we 're so proud of him that his portrait is on two different banknotes !, 
  there 's also a long tradition of having a poet laureate - someone who produces poems to mark important events . 
  the best-known of these is probably * the charge of the light brigade : *  theirs not to make reply ,  theirs not to reason why ,  theirs but to do and die :  into the valley of death  rode the six hundred . 
  the most recent laureate poem was * richard * by carol ann duffy , written for richard iii 's re-internment :  my bones , scripted in light , upon cold soil ,  a human braille . 
  my skull , scarred by a crown ,  emptied of history . 
  describe my soul  as incense , votive , vanishing ; your own  the same . 
  grant me the carving of my name . 
  sadly , they do n't actually let you fire a broadside of 6-inch shells into central london . 
  i think the most famous one here is the [ imperial war museum . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_war_museum ) if you 're into armoured vehicles then there 's the world 's largest collection of tanks at [ the tank museum , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_tank_museum ) including the only working tiger i tank ( as seen in * fury * ) and a mark i that 's the world 's oldest surviving combat tank . 
  i think you 're perhaps confusing the schengen area with the eu . 
  the schengen area is the area where countries have abolished internal border controls . 
  you can go from portugal to poland without passing through any border controls ( because you can do that without leaving the schengen area ) . 
  you ca n't go from bulgaria to the uk without border checks as both countries are outside the schengen area even though they are in the eu . 
  there are also non-eu countries in the schengen area , such as switzerland . 
  [ the snowman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze9kpobx9j8 ) might be the most well-known british animation here since i think it 's been shown every christmas since 1982 . 
  it 's based on a picture book and follows the style of the book . 
  some other animated literary adaptations are [ watership down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s26la8bk14 ) and [ the bfg . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8hrik6g-o ) there are also some famous stop-motion films by aardman animations , such as [ chicken run ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeoft7hucds ) and [ wallace and gromit . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxynhhj4kdw ), 
  i presume we have a nuclear device hidden in the channel tunnel that we can detonate in the event of a zombie apocalypse ? 
  according to the 2011 census , 98 % of people in scotland can speak english and 96 % can speak , read and write english . 
  [ berkeley castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berkeley_castle ) has been owned by the same family since the early 12th century . 
  no and i 've never seen it in someone else 's home either . 
  it 's not a term i 'm familiar with and from reading that wikipedia article it seems like it 's more restrictive then the laws we have here :  castle doctrines negate the duty to retreat when an individual is assaulted in a place where that individual has a right to be , such as within one 's own home . 
  deadly force may be justified and a defense of justifiable homicide applicable , in cases `` when the actor reasonably fears imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm to him or herself or another '' . 
  here , you 're still able to use self-defence as a defence against criminal charges even if you were able to retreat and did n't , so having a `` duty to retreat '' is a stricter position than we have here and not one i 'd want . 
  self-defence here has to be proportionate so you 're able to use deadly force to prevent someone from being killed . 
  and recipes that use cups !, 
  what do i think about british entertainment or what do british people think about entertainment in general ? 
  perhaps scotland can get its own eurovision entry ... 
  just wait until david attenborough leads the new new model army against charles 's royalist forces . 
  ouch !, 
  ^ ^ we ^ ^ do ^ ^ suck ^ ^ though . 
  i 've heard `` armchair general '' here . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_greatest_britons it 's not a scientific study and there was apparently quite a bit of campaigning going on but it does give a fair overview of the sort of people that british people consider to be important . 
  alan turing was # 21 , david attenborough was # 63 and montgomery was # 88 . 
  kitchener did n't feature ; i do n't think he 's well-known here outside of people who take an interest in the first world war . 
  really - https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/schots_ ( taal ), 
  damn , queenie 's lookin ' good there . 
  probably , but it 's not like i need to travel down south to see strippers . 
   anytime , rainy , inside , alone , barry 's i got a bit sentimental reading that . 
  the bbc conducted a poll in 2002 for a series called * 100 greatest britons * and the top answers were : - sir winston churchill - prime minister from 1940 to 1945 and 1951 to 1955 .
