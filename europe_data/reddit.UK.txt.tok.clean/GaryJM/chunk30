  - horatio nelson - famous naval commander , especially remembered for defeating napoleon at trafalgar . 
  - oliver cromwell - lead the new model army in their victory over royalist forces in the english civil war . 
  this was quite a controversial choice as cromwell is seen as a hero of democracy and liberty by some but as a genocidal dictator by others . 
  saying that , dutch speakers might do ok in scotland - it might not surprise you that `` twa breeks '' means `` two trousers '' here . 
  or that `` tae ken '' is `` to know '' or that a church is a `` kirk '' and a cow is a `` coo '' . 
  [ # 1 notes .

  - morning . 
  - cold and sunny . 
  - inside . 
  - alone . 
  - black ceramic cappuccino mug . 
  - hot water - normal strength . 
  - steamed and foamed milk . 
  no sugar . 
  - buttered toast with vintage orange marmalade . 
  perhaps you could mention what it is you 're actually drinking ? 
  you know , tea , coffee , and so on ? 
  at least ma scots is pure quality , ken . 
  * * ah your german is ... not zo good . 
  we will speak english , yes ? 
  whaur 's the station ya walloper ? 
  i do n't think many tourists are even aware of scots . 
  people arrive here , they see all the signs are in english , they converse with the airport staff in english and it 's all fine and then they get into a taxi and the driver asks , `` whauryiztae ? '', 
  and they realise they have no idea what 's being said . 
  or perhaps a bartender will ask , `` whityizfir ? '', 
  or someone serving in a fish and chip shop will ask `` sosswiat ? '', 
  # 3.50 / 3 litres \u00d7 7.5 % abv \u00f7 10 ml per unit = 16 p per unit # 7 / 750 ml \u00d7 15 % abv \u00f7 10 ml per unit = 62 p per unit unless you 're buying 3 litre bottle of port ? 
  there was a report released today about under-age drinking being fuelled by cheap drinks and cider was mentioned as the cheapest compared to how much alcohol was in it ( as low as # 0.16 per 10 ml of pure alcohol ) , perry was next at # 0.19 per unit , then beer ( # 0.23 ) , wine ( # 0.32 ) and vodka ( # 0.36 ) . 
  so , for people who are concerned with cost above all ( ie teenagers and alcoholics ) even the cheapest spirit ( supermarket own-brand vodka ) is way more expensive than other drinks . 
  my british dictionary ( collins ) defines * liquor * as :  any alcoholic drink , especially spirits but merriam-webster ( an american dictionary ) says :  a usually distilled , rather than fermented , alcoholic beverage ... so i suppose it depends on which dialect of english you 're speaking . 
  my dialect does n't use `` liquor '' for distilled drinks , those are always `` spirits '' . 
   i 've always loved the way that the german combines words to form a new concept - such as flugzeug are you making a rather subtle joke here ? 
  * flugzeug * in english is aircraft , from `` air '' + `` craft '' . 
  you can get a 3 litre bottle of white cider here for # 3.50 and it 's 7.5 % abv . 
  the uk has n't used proof to measure alcoholic strength since 1980 but a quick calculation tells me that 7.5 % abv is 13 \u00b0 on the british scale or 15 \u00b0 on the american scale . 
  what about some recipe books ? 
  is there a secret bunker under austria where * sachertorte * recipes are being stored in case of a disaster ? 
  i tried to think up some literature answers as well but that seemed to be harder . 
  the complete works of shakespeare perhaps ? 
  - * on the origin of species by means of natural selection , or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life * by charles darwin - * philosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica * by isaac newton - * the selfish gene * by richard dawkins, 
  - you can get peanut butter here . 
  i 'm not sure how popular it is ; personally i ca n't stand the stuff . 
  - preserves are very popular here . 
  [ my city has its own style of marmalade , made from seville oranges . 
  ] ( http://www.mackays.com/our-story/dundee-marmalade ) strawberry and raspberry are probably the most popular jams but you can get a wide range of other preserves . 
  - ready-to-eat meals are also very popular here , both frozen and chilled . 
  - breakfast cereals are popular here ; the big brands are kelloggs and nestle . 
  for a cooked breakfast , common items include : back bacon , eggs , sausages , square sausage , potato scones , baked beans in tomato sauce , black pudding , white pudding , fruit pudding , sliced haggis , fried bread and toasted bread . 
  most people do n't normally eat a full cooked breakfast but many will have one as an occasional treat , especially on a hung-over sunday morning !, 
  having a few of the ingredients on their own , such as a bacon roll or bacon and eggs , is more common . 
  - tea is the national hot drink and we 're fifth in the world for per-capita tea consumption , though tea is gradually losing ground to coffee . 
  i do n't drink tea and have an espresso machine at home , though this is n't common - most people will use an electric kettle for tea or instant coffee . 
  we probably get the same range of coca-cola and pepsi products that you do . 
  one notable exception is irn-bru , a distinctively scottish soft drink . 
  it 's not common to drink milk as an accompaniment to a meal , as i 've seen americans do ( do canadians do this ? ) . 
  - tomato ketchup is the most common condiment , closely followed by [ brown sauce . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_sauce ) people will argue passionately over which sauce is appropriate for which foods . 
  fish and chips usually come with salt and vinegar , though in the area around edinburgh you get `` chippy sauce '' instead , which is brown sauce diluted with vinegar . 
  - i buy dried pasta and jars of pre-made sauce . 
  - whisky ( scotch ) is the national drink . 
  scotch ale used to be the main beer style , then it gave way to lagers , now craft beer styles are becoming popular . 
  yeah , i live in scotland and i 've never voted snp but i still admire nicola sturgeon . 
  as i understand it , some people thought that there was too much immigration to the uk so the government has reduced the number of visas issued each year . 
  if a job 's on the shortage list then that means employers here can go straight to recruiting people from abroad ( normally they have to show they ca n't fill the job with someone who already lives here ) and if the number of work visas is running out ( only so many are issued each year ) then priority goes to people applying for jobs on the shortage list , so if you ever decided to apply for jobs here then you 'd have an advantage over some of the other people applying . 
  if you come to the uk on a [ standard visitor visa , ] ( https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor-visa/eligibility ) one of the conditions of that visa is that you can show you intend to return home at the end of your trip . 
  if immigration officials suspect that you do n't intend to return the us ( and only having a one-way ticket will be a red flag ) then they 'll refuse you entry . 
  it 's hard to imagine someone going from being a backpacker to getting a tier 2 work visa because you need to have some seriously in-demand skills to get one of those visas and if you 're that in-demand then you do n't need to backpack around handing out your cv . 
  there 's an [ occupation shortage list ] ( https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-k-shortage-occupation-list ) that shows you which jobs are in demand here . 
  every country has different immigration laws though so perhaps your plan might work somewhere else in europe . 
  edit : once you 've been living here for 5 years you can apply for permanent residence and then a year after you 've become a permanent resident you can apply for citizenship . 
  the hard part is getting the work visa to come here in the first place . 
  if it was a `` new and sudden unification '' i doubt many people would support it ; creating a new country of half a billion people seems like the kind of thing that should be considered seriously . 
  would the federal states be the same as existing eu member states or would states be balanced somehow , perhaps by splitting the larger countries up into multiple states ? 
  what powers would the states have and what powers would the european federal government have ? 
  what would happen to existing political structures ? 
  edit : sorry , i did n't really answer your question . 
  i 'm not for or against a federal europe in principle so i would base my decisions on the particular form it took . 
  also whether my country ( either as the uk or as just scotland ) was actually involved might change my opinion . 
  aww  she looked so worried . 
  yes , i do n't think a video can really convey atmosphere very well . 
  50,000 liverpool fans singing `` you 'll never walk alone '' in unison is probably fairly loud . 
  well , that was ... that was really something . 
  you certainly could n't say there was a lack of atmosphere there but at the same time it seems very different from sporting events here . 
  what did you think of the video i linked to ? 
  did it seem subdued to you because the stadiums are n't quite as large as american ones ? 
  if [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndqkasezwa ) is a more subdued atmosphere than you 're used to then i 'd love to see a video of the sort of games you attend because they must be insane !, 
  in british english , `` america '' means the usa and `` the americas '' refers to north and south america together . 
  `` american '' usually means `` from the usa '' but can mean `` from the americas '' in some contexts . 
  that 's you off the royal christmas card list . 
   west tower looks like something from the background of a computer game made by someone who did n't have a lot of time to make it look good . 
  she 's not been an hrh since 1952 , so you might want to update your address book . 
  yes , the 259 metre tower in op 's post would actually be the second-tallest building in the whole uk if it had been built here . 
  the only building taller would be the shard , at 309 metres . 
  i live in a city of around 150,000 people and apparently our tallest building is a 44 metre block of flats . 
  [ we already sent someone to assassinate trump , it just did n't go to plan . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-37357350 ), 
  a slice of processed cheese and some barbecue sauce . 
  there 's only five private universities in the uk and i have to admit i do n't know much about them . 
  both countries produce it , though it does seem to be mostly canadian maple syrup i see in the shops here .
