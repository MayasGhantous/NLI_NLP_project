  auld bastard that i am , i did highers in fifth year and certificates of sixth year studies in sixth year . 
  i 'm glad you linked to a page clarifying that `` daddy long-legs '' in the uk refers to craneflies , because in the us it seems to refer to the cellar spider , leading to a rather confusing episode of mythbusters ( for british people ) where they test the `` venom of the daddy long-legs spider '' .

  how would you re-brand the british special forces , if you had the chance to ? 
  on the contrary , names like special air service or special boat service are suitably understated , whereas names like delta force or marine raiders or army rangers are gauche and d\u00e9class\u00e9 .

  i just had a look at the website for coca-cola uk and the only water brands it mentions are abbey well and glac\u00e9au . 
  in 2004 , the coca-cola company launched their dasani brand of bottled water in the uk . 
  this went so poorly that i 'm sure it 's now taught as an example of how not to launch a product . 
  - consumers in the uk were used to bottled water being from natural sources such as springs . 
  when it was revealed that dasani was processed tap water there were many mocking parallels drawn between dasani and `` peckham spring '' , a fictional bottled water from the sitcom * only fools and horses . 
  * - early advertisements referred to dasani as `` bottled spunk '' , unaware that * spunk * is more likely to be used by british people to refer to semen than to courage . 
  - it was discovered that the treatment process used to produce dasani was actually causing bromide in the water to be converted to bromate , a suspected carcinogen . 
  that last problem resulted in coca-cola completely withdrawing dasani from the british market , though obviously it was n't doing great before that either . 
  the brand had such a negative image that when coca-cola acquired to rights to be the official drink sponsor of the 2012 olympic games in london they purchased a british bottling company and used them to produce schweppes-branded water , rather than try and distribute anything with the dasani brand . 
  definitely a backronym .

  we 've got : black - general waste brown - garden waster blue - paper and card green bin - food waste green box - recyclable plastic and glass, 
  the codes are supposed to be based on the geographic part of a country 's name , as opposed to the political part . 
  so for `` islamic republic of iran '' they just use the `` iran '' part and get `` ir '' , for `` united mexican states '' they get `` mx '' , and so on . 
  of course , the united states of america have managed to get us and usa as their codes , so `` uk '' for the united kingdom of great britain and ireland would n't be too problematic , i 'd think , and it would save quite a bit of confusion . 
  you do n't think it 'll go like the eurovision song contest and admit australia ? 
  i would n't really expect you to know all about british history in detail ( i certainly do n't !, 
  ) , i was meaning more that since ireland has been independent from the uk for your whole lifetime ( i assume ) , it 's a bit curious that you had the idea that it was n't . 
  i 'm sorry , that 's just factually incorrect . 
  gb is the iso 3166-2 country code for the whole united kingdom - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2:gb edit : also , all british overseas territories have their own flags - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_overseas_territories#current_overseas_territories, 
  that 's technically correct though - gb is the country code for the united kingdom . 
  it changed in 1922 after irish forces won the irish war of independence .

  we actually chose a monarch as well - a dutch one , as it happens .

   immersion heather your water must have a lovely floral scent . 
  british society is based around heating up water . 
  no electric showers either and you 'd have to be careful with your electric cooker not to turn on too many elements at the same time . 
  it 's hard to believe that a british electric shower uses as much power as three italian houses .

  during the scottish independence referendum in 2012 it was claimed that if scotland left the uk then orkney and shetland would leave scotland , perhaps becoming to scotland what the faroe islands are to denmark .

  if the uk considered gibraltar to be a part of it then i suppose we would have a border with spain . 
  if there were any gibraltarians on this sub , i think they would have an interesting view on `` possible future border changes '' . 
  italia joining up with illyria ? 
  sounds like the start of another roman empire . 
  well , the prospect of a border appearing between scotland and england seems entirely possible , in fact it 's a constant topic of discussion on / r/scotland . 
  the prospect of the uk 's only current border ( between ireland and northern ireland ) disappearing ( as in a united ireland ) is also something that some people are in favour of . 
  it does n't seem likely any time soon but then 100 years is a long time , so who knows . 
  welsh independence also seems unlikely , though i have to admit having little knowledge of welsh politics . 
  one could easily imagine something happening in the next century that might cause a split between england and wales . 
  any other independence movements such as cornish independence seem extremely unlikely . 
  perhaps england might devolve power to regional assemblies or something but it 's hard to imagine england splitting up short of a civil war or something . 
  we 've only got one border , so ... that one .
