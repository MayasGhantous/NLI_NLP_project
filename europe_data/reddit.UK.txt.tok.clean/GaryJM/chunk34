  and sure , there 's loads of ill-informed people on reddit and you can either try and correct them or just ignore them . 
  surely you 've seen the comments from your countrymen on this site about how europe is going to become a sharia-run state any minute now ? 
  you ca n't take these things too personally . 
  if you honestly ca n't bear british people describing how tv adverts for prescription drugs seem strange to them or how the high number of adverts on american tv also seem strange then perhaps reddit is not the site for you . 
  i 've seen american describe the bbc as a tool of state-sponsored fascist oppression since it 's funded through a licence fee but you do n't see me posting on / r/askanamerican claiming that americans are obsessed with slagging off the uk . 
  how silly of me !, 
  i forgot how diverse the usa was . 
  god forbid someone spend time thinking about things . 
  what 's with pretending europeans are obsessed with bashing the usa ? 
  does it make you feel better about yourself ? 
  except that importing most british meat into the usa has been illegal for decades . 
  you got me - i assumed that you ca n't get freshly-killed scottish game in the usa . 
  i mean , it just seemed logical to me but i guess i was wrong and i apologise . 
  a single scottish person visited the usa and had a poor experience shopping for food there !, 
  guess that means the whole of europe is obsessed with bashing the usa at every opportunity !, 
  the game 's up everyone - this guy 's onto our plan . 
  if only our crippling feelings of inadequacy had n't driven us to do this !, 
  i agree that american politics affects the whole world and thus is a common thing to discuss - the front page of bbc news currently has a story about what donald trump thinks about nfl quarterback colin kaepernick - but that 's a different thing from `` obsessing '' and `` lecturing '' . 
  if you honestly think that me reassuring an american that people in my country * do n't * think american cuisine is bad just because lots of american fast food chains operate here is me `` obsessing '' and `` lecturing '' then you have serious problems with your comprehension . 
  the first of my comments is about how the poster before me ( an american ) should n't worry about how europeans view american cuisine because we realise that americans have fine dining restaurants , it 's just that fine dining restaurants ca n't be set up in other countries in the way that fast food restaurants can . 
  the second comment is a quote from a link that a previous poster requested and not something i wrote myself . 
  the third one is a humorous post about how traditional european foods such as black pudding are n't popular in the usa . 
  i think bother americans and europeans would agree there was some truth to that stereotype . 
  the fourth one is me saying that the british film institute consider the star wars films to be british . 
  which they do - look it up . 
  i actually said that i personally * do n't * consider those films to be british . 
  no idea what any of this has to do with lecturing americans , which is why i assume op is just trying to wind us up . 
  oh , you 're just trolling . 
  sorry , i thought you were being serious . 
  oh well , better luck next time . 
  you might have got me to fall for it if you were a bit more subtle so you might want to try that in future . 
  good luck !, 
  i suspect they 'll be encouraged to change the colour of the cover the next time they redesign their passports . 
  the question itself is problematic though . 
  do any of the posters on this sub obsess over the us ? 
  do any of them constantly lecture americans ? 
  i suspect that the answer is `` no '' and therefore nobody here will be able to answer the question you have posed . 
  the `` resolution of the representatives of the governments of the member states of the european communities , meeting within the council of 23 june 1981 '' states that passports of member states will be burgundy red in colour . 
  eu member states have agreed to standardise the colour of their passports , which is why so many are burgundy red in colour . 
  since the colour of different british passports is standardised too , that means some north american passports are burgundy - anguilla , bermuda , british virgin islands , cayman islands , montserrat and the turks and caicos islands . 
  i 'm not sure how the rest of north america seems to have settled on blue passports . 
  the caribbean community countries might have made blue the standard for their members but that does n't explain the rest . 
  perhaps it 's just countries influencing their neighbours ? 
  we seem to be the opposite here , with a lot of focus on history and tradition . 
  the coat of arms on the british passport is from 1837 but parts of it have been in use since the 12th century . 
  inside the passport are themed pages based on the idea of britain 's history of creativity : the marine chronometer , the postage stamp , the steam locomotive , the underground railway , the difference engine , etc. 
  there 's some modern elements in there as well but the overall impression the passport gives is one of a nation with a long and distinguished history . 
  even the introductory text is imposing :  her britannic majesty 's secretary of state requests and requires in the name of her majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance , and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary . 
  if you 'd like to see all the eu passports you can go [ here ] ( https://www.passportindex.org/byregion.php ) and choose `` european union members '' from the drop-down box . 
  i like the look of the swedish one as it does n't just go for the simple coat of arms like the other ones . 
  i 'm going to disagree with the other british commentator here and say that we have several . 
  english is clearly a * de facto * official language . 
  our laws are made in english , government documents like passports and driving licenses are in english , road signs are in english ... it could n't be any more of an official language . 
  sure , there 's no british legislation that explicitly says `` english is the official language of the uk '' but that 's because english is so obviously the official language of the uk that we 've never needed to . 
  the uk government has ratified the european charter for regional or minority languages in respect of six languages , giving them limited official recognition : - cornish in cornwall - irish and ulster scots in northern ireland - scots and scottish gaelic in scotland - welsh in wales of these , the welsh language ( wales ) measure 2011 makes welsh an official language in wales and the gaelic language ( scotland ) act 2005 does something similar but only requires public bodies to act `` with a view to securing the status of the gaelic language as an official language of scotland . '', 
  cornish , irish , ulster scots and scots are merely recognised but not promoted . 
  you ca n't request that your child be educated in a scots-medium school in the way that you can request a welsh or gaelic education for them . 
  the government have also said that they recognise the importance of british sign language but that there 's currently no legal framework for officially recognising it in the way that the charter for regional or minority languages does , though they intend to take action to improve access to bsl . 
  i 've no idea . 
  [ `` i do n't see why a woman who decides to get pregnant should be paid . 
  she 's not working , and therefore , not contributing to the company . 
  if the owner wants to pay her , fine , but he should n't be required to .

  i 'm guessing you meant to ask if we think american redditors care about european politics * more * than their own ? 
  if so then my answer would be `` no '' . 
  the americans i 've seen on here seem to be one of : - they do n't care about politics at all . 
  - they care about american politics only . 
  - they care about american and international politics . 
  i do n't think i 've seen * anyone * who was interested in foreign but not domestic politics . 
  if you 're looking for an eu and un member state to play while discussing brexit how about ... oh i dunno ... the uk ? 
  depends how strict op 's definition of `` movies your country has ever produced '' is i suppose . 
  the british film institute consider * star wars : the force awakens * to be the biggest-grossing british film of all time , for example . 
  the counterfeiters is an excellent film . 
  someone else who has heard of the hill !, 
   we 're all doing time ... even the screws .

  the previous poster mentioned attending a burial but these have become relatively rare in the uk - three-quarters of bodies are cremated these days , not buried . 
  i 've been to six funerals and all six were cremations . 
  none of them had viewings either . 
  the ones on * father ted * do . 
  you should check it out . 
  ( do n't worry , i was just quoting * father ted . 
  i suppose the motto of the european union would be a good candidate - * unit\u00e9 dans la diversit\u00e9 . 
  fup off you fupping baxter !, 
  ^ good cunt right here . 
  never heard of it before . 
  investing money is fairly common here . 
  around half of employed and self-employed people put money into a private pension , for example . 
  the uk flag is obviously just a combination of scottish , english and irish flags . 
  the scottish flag has a story behind it though :  according to legend , in 832 ad \u00d3engus ii led an army of picts and scots into battle against the angles , led by \u00c6thelstan , near modern-day athelstaneford , east lothian . 
  the legend states that whilst engaged in prayer on the eve of battle , \u00d3engus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint saint andrew as the patron saint of scotland ; andrew then appeared to \u00d3engus that night in a dream and assured him of victory .
