  no , it was just that you posted a lot of questions in quick succession . 
  did you wake up today full of curiosity about europe ? 
  salt and vinegar . 
  do you write for buzzfeed or something ? 
  there used to be a lot of sectarian trouble but these days it 's all about which is the proper condiment to put on chips . 
  scotland does n't have time for international rivalries ; we save all our aggression for our archenemies - other scots . 
  after that , we 've got the rest of the uk to deal with . 
  all the tourists i 've met in person have been fine but for some reason people like to visit buckingham palace and annoy the guards . 
  i 'm sure they would n't do it at home . 
  not trying to annoy soldiers . 
   i 'll say all the james bond movies ... how dare you !, 
  those are films made by a british production company about a british spy , based on books by a british author and starring a british actor as bond ( apart from the australian one and the irish one ) and directed by british directors ( apart from the four that were n't ) . 
   ... but just to annoy my british friends . 
   oh ... well played !, 
  there definitely is n't for the uk , only visas for tourists , students , workers , people with british spouses and people with recent british ancestors . 
  if you want to retire here then you need to come and work here first ( or be an eea citizen ) . 
  i love a good heist film so i shall say ** heat . 
  **  heat is a 1995 american crime film written , produced and directed by michael mann , and starring robert de niro , al pacino , and val kilmer . 
  de niro plays neil mccauley , a professional thief , while pacino plays lt. vincent hanna , a veteran lapd robbery-homicide detective tracking down mccauley 's crew . 
  the central conflict is based on the experiences of former chicago police officer chuck adamson and his pursuit in the 1960s of a criminal named mccauley , after whom de niro 's character is named . 
  edit : do you have a favourite scottish film ? 
  or a favourite british film ? 
  dunno , that feels like more of a glasgow thing than a whole-of-scotland thing . 
  we 've got these wee guys as well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_wildcat, 
  `` polish sea boars '' should be thing like scottish wild haggises , australian drop bears or the new zealand garden ban . 
  terrifying . 
  i 've seen this [ irish public safety film ] ( http://i.imgur.com/msegf.jpg ) about them . 
  it 's a small-scale test to see how well the beavers will do here . 
  seeing as farmers are shooting them , i guess it 's not going well . 
  i 'm not sure i would call eu membership a left-right issue . 
  if you look at the position that parties took during the uk 's eu membership referendum , both sides of the debate had parties from both sides of the political spectrum supporting that position . 
  google.com redirects to google.co.uk for me . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wild_haggis `` according to an online survey commissioned by haggis manufacturers hall 's of broxburn , released on 26 november 2003 , one-third of u.s. visitors to scotland believed the wild haggis to be a real creature . '', 
  i can hardly imagine it either !, 
  urban london is a city with the population of michigan and metropolitan london has the population of illinois . 
  if i go to glasgow it feels like `` the big city '' and it 's only got 600,000 people . 
  scotland 's capital city only has 500,000 people . 
  yes , it 's a pudding ( in the sausage-like sense of the word , not the american sense ) made of minced sheep 's heart , liver and lungs mixed with oatmeal and spices . 
  the joke is that scottish people tell tourists that it actually comes from an animal called the haggis . 
  sure , but apart from the polish sea boar and the wild haggis and the loch ness monster we do n't have any scary animals . 
  [ we 're still working on reintroducing beavers so wolves will probably be a long way off . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-35568593 ), 
  if i ever go on holiday to poland , i shall be sure to stay away from the water !, 
  actually , there is big problem where i live with seagulls [ mewowate ] attacking people - they fly down and steal food from people 's hands . 
  it 's the only place in the uk it would be remotely feasible . 
  the population density up here is only 68 people per square kilometre , compared to 131 in northern ireland , 148 in wales and 421 in england . 
  plus , scotland 's population is concentrated in the southern lowlands , so the density in the highlands is lower than the average . 
  population density in the usa , for comparison , is only 35 people per square kilometre . 
  i appreciate that was a little bit cheeky  really though , europe is n't the place to go to to find excitingly deadly animals . 
  no , it 's mostly farmers who are worried about wolves killing their animals . 
  there 's also concern from people who make money from shooting sports , mainly deer stalking . 
  i knew people had been killed by cows but i did n't realise it was as many as that ; good find !, 
  i 'm sure most of us know what those animals look like but , well , op did ask for pictures ... 
  they were exterminated during the middle ages . 
  people have been talking for the last couple of decades about reintroducing them in scotland but it 's still controversial and there are currently no plans to do this . 
  gray wolves are actually native to both north america and eurasia . 
  edit : the current largest native carnivore in the uk is the fearsome european badger and the largest native mammal is the red deer . 
  i had no idea poland was so dangerous !, 
  floofy but deadly !, 
  if you 're seriously allergic to them , that is . 
  if you 're not then it 'll just hurt if they sting you . 
  do n't really know because i 've never been stung . 
  the deadliest animals in the uk are insects in the suborder apocrita - bees , wasps , hornets , etc. 
  - which kill around 5 people a year through allergic reactions to their stings . 
  [ this is what a bee looks like . 
  ] ( http://data.wildlifetrusts.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/reserve_web_large/sites/data.live.wt.precedenthost.co.uk/files/bramble%20and%20bee%20cpt%20zsuzsanna%20bird.jpg ) these animals are common in the uk but rarely sting people and most people are not allergic to them . 
  the most dangerous mammal here is the dog ( * canis familiaris * ) . 
  these kill around two people per year . 
  [ they look like this . 
  ] ( https://www.cesarsway.com/sites/newcesarsway/files/styles/large_article_preview/public/common-dog-behaviors-explained.jpg?itok=fszwbboi ) they are common here but attacks by them are relatively rare . 
  we have one species of venomous snake - the adder ( * vipera berus * ) - but they have n't killed anyone for 40 years . 
  [ they look like this . 
  ] ( http://www.westernspring.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the-adder.jpg ), 
  no worries ; happens to the best of us . 
  same here , i started school in 1985 and we only ever played rounders with a tennis ball . 
  at secondary we played a kind of indoor cricket with a tennis ball as well , possibly a game the pe teacher had just made up . 
  that seems very similar . 
  [ this is what rounders looks like . 
  ] ( http://www.psarchive.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/rounders.jpg ) you hit the ball with a bat and then try to run round the bases before the other team can retrieve the ball . 
  very similar to many other games . 
  have you heard of * br\u00e4nnboll ? 
  * it 's similar to that . 
  - * mony a mickle maks a muckle * - many small things together make a big thing = if you look after the small things in life then the big things will take care of themselves . 
  - * we 're a ' jock tamson 's bairns * - we 're all god 's children = we 're all equal . 
  [ lots of you might recognise * bairn * as being the same as the word * barn * in your language . ], 
  - * lang may yer lum reek * - long may your chimney smoke = i wish you well for the future ( a smoking chimney shows you can afford to burn fuel ) . 
  we grow up playing games like cricket and rounders the same way you grow up playing baseball . 
  i live on the coast of north-east scotland . 
  average winter low is around 1 c and the record low is -17 c. snowfall is quite rare here , maybe only 10 days a year . 
  it gets colder and snowier as you head up into the scottish highlands . 
  as i understand it , college sports are big in the usa in areas that are not served by professional sports teams . 
  the nfl has 32 clubs for 319 million people - almost 10 million people per club . 
  it 's a similar story for the nba ( 29 american teams ) and mlb ( 30 teams ) and nhl ( 30 teams ) . 
  so for the vast majority of americans , there just is n't a professional team for them to follow and so they turn to supporting their local college ( or even high school ) sports . 
  scotland , on the other hand , has 42 professional football clubs serving 5.3 million people - 126,000 people per club , 100 times as `` dense '' as the usa . 
  this means virtually everyone has a local professional club they can support . 
  the city i live in has two professional clubs and there are four more within a couple of dozen miles . 
  since professional clubs are so ubiquitous , there 's no interest in seeing students play . 
  also , young people here who are talented at sport do n't go to university to play that sport , like they do in the usa , they join a professional club at a young age and develop their talent there . 
  so if you do go to see a university team , you will be seeing genuine amateurs .
