  or ignore all that , fly into edinburgh , head down to london across to paris then over to the south of germany , up to the north of germany , over into the netherlands and finish in belgium . 
  i 'm probably not helping  but public transport is very good in the densely-populated parts of europe and every big city will have hostels and so on that cater to backpackers . 
  i would caution against trying to see the whole continent in one trip as you 'll end up spending so much time travelling that you do n't spend much time doing anything else , though travelling ( especially by train ) can be fun in itself . 
  scotland 's fantastic ( in my biased opinion ) but it does rather put you on the wrong side of the continent for the rest of your itinerary . 
  how long do you plan to spend travelling ? 
  how experienced a traveller are you ? 
  have you narrowed your plans down to any particular countries ? 
  i can give you info about scotland but it would n't be much use if you only planned to travel round continental europe or the schengen area , 
  it 's a quote from * the simpsons .

  the ** internationale spieltage ** in essen is the gaming convention that i hear the most about , though i have n't been there myself . 
  no , i did a higher national certificate . 
  it 's roughly equivalent to the first year of a degree . 
  that would miss out my answer as i completed secondary school and went on to a further education college but i never went on to higher education . 
   the uk from 1987-1990 ... had almost zero american content . 
  you can look up archived listings of what was broadcast on the bbc . 
  for bbc one : - this week in 1987 had : the pink panther show , dallas , the flintstones , the muppet babies , gentle ben , dynasty , miami vice , bonanza , how bugs bunny won the west and the muppet show . 
  - this week in 1988 had : ironside , the people 's court , miami vice , gentle ben , barney bear , dallas , the muppet babies , columbo and bonanza . 
  - this week in 1989 had : the flintstones , the pink panther show , cagney and lacey , macgyver , columbo and the odd couple . 
  - this week in 1990 had : the perils of penelope pitstop , the six million dollar man , miami vice , laurel and hardy , the all new popeye show , ewoks , cagney and lacey , gentle ben , muppet babies , lassie 's great adventure and bugs bunny 's year . 
  so i would n't say there was no american tv on but it was mostly children 's programmes ( which i watched ) or daytime fare such as columbo or dallas . 
  miami vice was the only `` prime-time '' american programme out of all the days i checked . 
  if your parents only watched prime-time tv then that would explain why they thought there were no american programmes on here . 
  for the benefit of anyone else who did n't know what op was talking about , here 's a quote from wikipedia :  the care package was the original unit of aid distributed by the humanitarian organization care ( cooperative for assistance and relief everywhere ) . 
  although `` care package '' is a registered trademark , the term has since been widely adopted as a generic term for a parcel of food or supplies sent for relief or comfort purposes . 
  i guess i would send sweets like tablet , fudge and toffee , as those would travel well . 
  maybe some shortbread if it was packaged well . 
  oh , and some irn-bru too . 
  ca n't really think of any non-food items ; i suppose those would depend on the particular person i was sending things to . 
  if you mean food cooked by smoking ( as / u/okiewxchaser said ) then a good suggestion would be the arbroath smokie - hot-smoked haddock from the north-east of scotland that 's been made here since the 19th century . 
  [ here 's a video showing how they 're made . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/3cjqph5glee?t=42s ) `` barbecue '' in the uk usually just means burgers grilled outdoors over charcoal . 
  in scotland , if you 're in a fish and chip shop and you want to order something with chips then you ask for `` a supper '' . 
  so `` fish and chips '' is `` a fish supper '' , `` sausage and chips '' is `` a sausage supper '' , and so on . 
   i mean i kind of guessed a lot of our food is genuinely unappealing to people outside this country but still ; of all things . 
  i can imagine how you feel . 
  black pudding and haggis are totally normal foods here that you can get in any supermarket or butchers and yet there are many videos online of americans trying these foods and freaking out . 
  yes , it 's been a contentious issue between the usa and the eu for a while . 
  the eu says that parmesan , gorgonzola , neufch\u00e2tel and so on are the names of places , so people expect gruy\u00e8re cheese to actually come from gruy\u00e8res . 
  the usa says that these are merely the names of styles of cheese and that there 's no reason that they ca n't make a cheese in wisconsin and label it `` pecorino romano '' . 
  any cheese that has `` protected designation of origin '' status would qualify as `` proper cheese '' . 
  products with pdo status must be made in their traditional location using traditional methods and people are often quite proud of their local speciality foods . 
  * roquefort , * for example , must be made from the milk from particular breeds of sheep that are grazed in a particular area in france and fed on local grain or fodder , the bacteria used in producing the cheese has to come from the natural caves of roquefort-sur-soulzon and the whole process of maturing , cutting and packing the cheese must take place in roquefort-sur-soulzon . 
  in interesting post ; you 've certainly put a lot of thought into this . 
  i would ask if you had considered moving to scotland since we 're not very religious , you can own snakes here and [ we were rated as the best country in europe for lgbt legal protections . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/10/scotland-tops-league-for-gay-rights ) however , you mentioned a few times about `` learning the language '' so i presume that you 've ruled out the english-speaking european nations . 
  and , frankly , with all the political upheaval going on right now , i do n't blame you !, 
  i had battle isle 4 : incubation , history line 1914-1918 , the settlers and the patrician ( der patrizier ) on the amiga . 
  i 'm in a city in scotland and * atm * sounds like an americanism , * bank machine * sounds normal though * cash machine * is more common and * cashpoint * and * hole in the wall * are very rarely used , in my experience . 
  i 've never heard cashpoint and often hear bank machine so i suspect these are terms that will vary a lot depending on where you are in the country . 
  apparently joe flacco is an american man who plays american football for an american team . 
  so ... probably not something to ask / r/askeurope about . 
  i see your point but you could claim the snp were secretly planning * anything * and i would n't be able to show any evidence to the contrary . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't follow what you 're saying . 
  what does scotland wanting independence from the uk have to do with getting rid of our monarchy ? 
  i suppose that if we did want to get rid of the monarchy then that would be a good time to do it , but the one thing does n't have much to do with the other . 
  it 's not some sort of british monarchy that scotland ended up with through joining the uk , we 've had the monarchy since 843 ad , which is an awful lot longer than the 309 years we 've been part of great britain ( and later the uk ) . 
  for the last scottish independence referendum , the scottish national party had said that , if they were successful , scotland would keep its monarchy and elizabeth ii would become `` queen of scots . '', 
  polls of the scottish people at the the time also showed that a majority wanted to keep the monarchy . 
  a second referendum would obviously be different from the previous one , but i would be surprised if scottish people suddenly turned against the monarchy . 
  i do n't know what a northern irish independence referendum would look like . 
  no danish nuclear weapons , eh ? 
  [ then explain this !, 
  france and the uk have nuclear weapons and norway has that demon that they summoned imprisoned on svalbard , but we 're not meant to talk about that . 
   only two are . 
  yeah , the usa could nuke the uk and only suffer having 160 of its cities nuked in retaliation . 
  you irish sure are a contentious people . 
  i should say that i do n't know much about polish nationality law , and you should probably speak to someone who does . 
  but from what you 've said about your family , it does sound like you 've always been an american / polish dual citizen and you 've been an eu citizen since 2004 . 
  the same with your children , presumably . 
  it certainly sounds like it . 
  you were born to polish parents , which made you a polish citizen and ( i presume ) you were born in the usa , which made you an american citizen . 
  you got your american passport but you never got round to getting your polish one . 
  same story with your kids . 
  well , if wikipedia is correct then according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_nationality_law `` a child born to a polish parent is a polish citizen at birth . 
  this applies whether the child is born in poland or elsewhere . '', 
  if that 's the case then you 've always been a polish citizen and so have your children - assuming your parents were polish citizens and not foreign citizens who just happened to be born in poland and were never naturalised .

  what would the states be ? 
  what powers would the federal government have and what powers would the states have ? 
  no , there are a couple of million registered firearms here , mostly used for pest control and hunting , and i do n't know of anyone proposing that ownership of firearms be restricted to just the police and military .
