  i just had a look at the product design msc degree offered by the uni in my city and it 's around thirteen thousand pounds for international students , so definitely not cheap . 
  also , that 's an art degree and you mentioned wanting to do an engineering degree . 
  i 'm not sure who here does a design-oriented science master 's degree . 
  yes , i agree that if i had done that then it would have been rude . 
  i really was just curious why the op was n't considering the uk . 
  if he 'd said `` i am looking to study in german and i am considering austria and switzerland '' , i think people would naturally wonder why he was n't considering germany . 
  anyway , i shall withdraw my question . 
  who said it was necessary to go to a uk university ? 
  i 'm not saying that the op should n't consider dutch , german or swedish universities or that universities in those countries do n't offer courses in english . 
  all i was * asking * was why the op was n't considering the uk . 
  i 'm saying that * to me * the uk seems like an obvious candidate as virtually everyone speaks english and it 's the de facto official language here , plus there are good universities . 
  i am by no means saying that the uk is the only good place to study or that other eu countries are n't worth considering . 
  if i 've said something that suggested the opposite then i apologise but i really do n't see where you 're getting the idea from that i 'm suggesting the op not consider other countries . 
  i was n't saying that op should * only * consider the uk , i was just asking because it seemed like the most obvious candidate for an eu country with english-language university education . 
  it would be like like someone asking about french-language courses and not considering france . 
  the possibility of the uk leaving the eu at some point might have affected the op 's choice of countries , which is why i was asking . 
  i would dispute that it 's something that would happen soon though ; even if the uk voted to leave the eu i 'm sure it would take a long time to sort out all the details . 
  ~ ~ how come you 're looking to do an english-language course but you are n't considering the uk ? ~ ~, 
  they think you 're saying that you hope our plucky chaps can defeat the bloody huns and have this damned war over by christmas .

  what about edinburgh ? 
  english-speaking , the capital of scotland , large finance sector ( after the nhs , the local government and the university of edinburgh , the biggest employers are royal bank of scotland group , lloyds banking group and standard life ) , second-highest gva per resident ( after london ) , hosts the largest annual international arts festival in the world , the city centre is a unesco world heritage site , 16 % of the residents were born abroad ( including 3,700 american ) , etc. 
  yes , that 's true  sorry if my comment was n't clear , i 'll try to explain better . 
  the original question referred to `` the national identity '' , which , for the uk , i took to mean `` identifying as british '' . 
  i was making the point that many people do n't identify as british and , instead , identify with their `` region '' . 
  but you 're right - for those people their `` region '' * is * their nation . 
  maybe the answer to `` how strong are regional identities in your country ? '', 
  should be `` what do you mean by ` regional ' and what do you mean by ` your country ' '' ? 
  i used to date a woman who lived in newcastle and whenever i was there i would n't find it too foreign at first and then i 'd be in a shop and they 'd squint suspiciously at my scottish money and i 'd feel like a stranger in a strange land . 
  my mother was from larbert and my father was from stenhousemuir and it always confused me how they ( and everyone else there ) talked about the two places as if they were different towns when , to me , they seem like they 're just suburbs of falkirk . 
  my dad 's parents moved from stenhousemuir to carronshore and you 'd think they 'd moved to the moon the way people talked about it . 
  yes . 
  personally , i find that `` my country '' can be both scotland and the uk , depending on context . 
  if a british person asked me about regional identities i would probably talk about scottish ones - east coast versus west coast , north versus south and so on . 
  whereas , if a european asks me about regional identities ( as in this thread ) then i tend to think of myself as british and our regions as scotland , england , etc. 
  possibly i would split england into north and south , or north , midlands and south . 
  for many people , `` my country '' only ever refers to scotland , england , etc. 
  and never to the uk . 
  a cousin of mine seriously refers to travelling from scotland to england as `` going abroad '' . 
  not a view i share but i respect that a lot of people feel the same way . 
  i 'd say that regional identities are definitely stronger than national ones here . 
  in the 2011 scottish census , 62 % of people described themselves as `` scottish only '' , 18 % said `` scottish and british '' and 8 % said `` british only '' . 
  in the census for england and wales , 58 % said they were `` english only '' , 4 % said `` welsh only '' , 10 % said british combined with something else and 20 % said `` british only '' . 
  in the census for northern ireland , 40 % said `` british only '' , 25 % said `` irish only '' , 21 % said `` northern irish only '' , 6 % said `` british and northern irish '' , 1 % said `` irish and northern irish '' , 1 % said `` british , irish and northern irish '' and 1 % said `` british and irish '' . 
  we do n't even have the country coming together for football games because we have four separate football teams !, 
  there was a report out recently about cycling rates in scotland and the most surprising part of it , to me , was that 41 % of households here ( in dundee ) do not have access to a car for private use and 51 % of adults do not have a driving licence . 
  i do n't have a driving licence but i 'd thought it was more uncommon than that . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/doric_dialect_ ( scotland ), 
  there seems to be less interest in that race . 
  the bookies here have hillary clinton way ahead of bernie sanders ( 3 to 1 versus 16 to 1 ) . 
  also , i think people here would be happy with either democratic candidate , compared with donald trump . 
  i do n't know what his reputation is like in the rest of europe but he 's sued the scottish government ( and lost ) three times , engaged in a war of words with the former scottish first minister , been stripped of his business ambassador status by the scottish government , been stripped of an honorary degree by a scottish university , been insulted by pretty much every politician here ( at a recent debate for the upcoming election , candidates were asked what they would say to donald trump , given the chance , and all the comments were pleas for americans not to vote for trump ) and been the subject of a petition and later a parliamentary debate on banning him from the country where the nicest thing anyone said about him was basically , `` yeah , he 's a dick , but that does n't mean we should ban him '' . 
  so , the idea of donald trump becoming us president is a scary one here because i ca n't imagine the uk - and especially scotland - has endeared itself to him recently . 
  it 's currently between 2 and 4 am in europe and i suspect most people are asleep . 
  for us night owls , the bbc news website has `` donald trump wins new york primary '' as its breaking top story , so there 's definitely interest in it . 
  i 'm not against it in principle , it would depend a lot on what the states were ( existing sovereign states or something else ? ), 
  and what powers the states had versus what powers the federation had . 
  i live in a suburb in scotland and i 've never owned a car . 
  i get my non-perishable groceries delivered from a supermarket and i supplement that by walking or cycling to the corner shop ( 500m ) or to the supermarket ( 800m ) . 
  as / u/viridianpanther says , this will vary hugely between , and even inside , countries . 
  i would say that , generally , subway systems are rare . 
  the uk only has three subway systems - two in london and one in glasgow . 
  italy has the most in europe , with seven . 
  much more common are light rail systems . 
  the uk has eight of these . 
  whether a bike is better than a train will depend on how suited the city is to cycling , your cycling ability , possibly things like the weather , etc. 
  i would n't call taking the bus `` expensive '' but it varies a lot . 
  i was recently in malta and it cost less there to get the bus across the whole island than it did to get the bus from my suburb to the city centre at home . 
  are buses difficult to learn ? 
  i would n't say so . 
  i live in a small city in scotland and the buses here have screens that tell you what the next stop is and the bus stops have electronic signs telling you what the next bus service is and when it arrives . 
  if you 've got a smartphone then it 's even easier as you can get apps that will tell you where to go , what bus to get , when to get off , etc. 
  again though , this will vary from country to country and city to city . 
  edit : the bus trip i make most often at home is $ 2.83 to go 3.4 miles . 
  that 's the maximum fare though ; any further within the same city would cost the same amount . 
  in malta it was $ 1.70 for any bus journey . 
  i think one of the most telling differences is that tony blair ( the prime minister from 1997 to 2007 ) was * prevented * from discussing his religious beliefs by his advisers . 
  it 's almost impossible to imagine that an american president would be told that he would be committing political suicide by saying `` god bless you '' at the end of a speech , or that an aide would interrupt a press conference to tell everyone that `` we do n't do god '' . 
  me neither . 
  i wish people would just say why they disagreed , instead of down-voting . 
  do they dispute that the us is set up to have a `` separation of church and state '' ? 
  do they dispute that the uk 's head of state is also head of the state religion ( in england at least ) ? 
  which of those countries sounds like the secular one ? 
  are people here confused about what secularism is ? 
  i was thinking of the `` separation of church and state '' sort of secularism and a lot of the stuff we have here - mandatory worship in schools , a state religion , bishops given seats in the legislature , etc. 
  - would n't be possible in the usa . 
  on the other hand , if you mean the `` freedom from religion '' sort of definition then the uk is more secular , though i think that 's just the effect of having a less-religious population . 
  the usa seems to have loads of politicians who propose legislation based on their religious beliefs but presumably they do that because that 's what their constituents want . 
  i would say that the usa is more secular than the uk but that the uk has far fewer religious people . 
  their party election broadcast was actually footage of a spokesman talking about how the bnp were being censored because they were n't allowed to broadcast the advert that they 'd originally made . 
  i 'm sure they knew that they were never going to be allowed to broadcast a cartoon about how all muslims are rapists , so presumably their plan all along was to play the `` i 'm being oppressed ! '', 
  card . 
  edit : the bnp have almost completely collapsed since their peak in 2010 . 
  at that election they fielded 338 candidates and got 563,743 votes ( though did n't win any seats ) . 
  in 2015 they only fielded 8 candidates and got 1,667 votes - fewer than the monster raving loony party ( 3,898 ) . 
  they 're the limits that people and parties are allowed to spend . 
  parties here get most of their funding from private donations but they also get some public funding too . 
  for example , at the last election the labour party received # 18 million in donations and # 6 million in public funding .
