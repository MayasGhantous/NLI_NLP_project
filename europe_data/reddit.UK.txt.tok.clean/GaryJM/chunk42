  one big difference between the uk and the usa is that political parties here are not allowed to buy tv or radio advertising . 
  instead , each party is allotted a certain number of broadcast slots . 
  interesting question . 
  here 's the rules for uk general elections . 
  political spending in the uk is regulated during two periods of time - the five weeks between parliament dissolving and the day of the election are called the `` short campaign '' . 
  the hundred days preceding the dissolution of parliament are called the `` long campaign '' . 
  during the long campaign , candidates are allowed to spend # 30,700 ( $ 43,600 ) plus 9p ( 13 cents ) per voter for rural constituencies or 6p ( 9 cents ) for urban ones . 
  during the short campaign , candidates can spend # 8,700 ( $ 12,300 ) plus 6p or 9p as above . 
  so , to take where i live as an example , someone standing for election here could spend a maximum of # 45,400 ( $ 64,500 ) . 
  there are also limits to how much political parties are allowed to spend . 
  a party contesting all 650 seats could spend up to # 19.5 million ( $ 27.7 million ) - equivalent to # 30,000 ( $ 42,600 ) per constituency . 
  non-party campaign groups are required to register with the electoral commission if they spend or plan to spend over # 20,000 ( $ 28,400 ) in england or # 10,000 ( $ 14,200 ) in any of scotland , wales or northern ireland . 
  these groups are also limited to spending a maximum of # 9,750 ( $ 13,800 ) in any one constituency . 
  according to the electoral commission , # 37,250,218.66 ( $ 52,951,558 ) was spent on the 2015 general election - 80p ( $ 1.14 ) per registered voter or # 1.21 ( $ 1.72 ) per actual voter . 
  since you mentioned in another comment that you were looking for serious answers i should say that i 've seen very little real animosity between scottish and english people . 
  lots of good-natured teasing and a little bit of heated political arguing but almost no serious problems . 
  scots and other scots . 
  i 'm obviously not down with the kids , as i never hear these , 
  i ca n't think of many , i 'm afraid . 
  the only one that comes to mind is calling marks and spencer `` marks and sparks '' , and they 're hardly a global chain . 
  we do tend to pronounce foreign business names as if they were english words , so ikea is / a\u026a\u02c8ki\u02d0\u0259 / instead of / \u026a\u02c8ke\u02d0\u02c8a / and lidl is / l\u026ad\u0259l / instead of / li\u02d0d\u0259l / . 
  edit : just thought of another thing we do here - use the possessive form of names of businesses . 
  so * costa coffee * becomes * costa 's * and * tesco * becomes * tesco 's * and so on . 
  zippo lighters might be a good idea , depending on how often your friends need to set fires . 
  bonus points if it 's got some especially american design on it . 
  [ just so you know , snickers bars are not considered a rare delicacy in europe  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/3dpuxy/visiting_your_beautiful_country_this_weekend_want ), 
  i 'd imagine this is the case for all of europe . 
  most people will just be descended from a long line of farmers who have lived in the same area for generations , a few noble families will have detailed family trees and the royal families will have every single member known in detail . 
  me personally ? 
  i 'm scottish , so were my parents and my grand-parents and my great-grandparents . 
  never researched any further back than that . 
  not that interested to be honest . 
  on the other hand , * some * europeans have very well-documented family trees . 
  you can look up exactly how prince george of cambridge ( born 2013 ) is descended from king alfred the great ( born around 849 ) . 
  `` non-super-expensive '' and you 've short-listed iceland ? 
  [ iceland is so expensive that the foreign office warn travellers about it !, 
  ] ( https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iceland/money ), 
  yeah , the bank of england only do # 5 , # 10 , # 20 and # 50 . 
  bank of scotland , royal bank of scotland and clydesdale bank all do those plus a # 100 note and rbs also do a # 1 note . 
  i only ever see fives , tens and twenties though . 
  we 've got some sciency banknotes up here : - [ a vignette of education and research on the reverse of the bank of scotland # 20 ] ( http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknoteapp/bos_t_20.html ) - [ lord kelvin on the obverse and the university of glasgow on the reverse of the clydesdale bank # 100 ] ( http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknoteapp/clyde_100.html ) - [ sir alexander fleming on the obverse of the clydesdale bank # 5 ] ( http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknoteapp/clyde_wh_5.html ) adam smith is the economist on the bank of england # 20 and the clydesdale bank # 50 . 
  if you 're into engineers , james watt is on the bank of england # 50 and sir william arrol is on the new clydesdale bank # 5 . 
  the men had a whip-round and got you this . 
  well , what i mean is i had the men roundly whipped until they got you this . 
  it 's a cigarillo case engraved with the regimental crest of two crossed dead frenchmen , emblazoned on a mound of dead frenchmen motif . 
   everything on the british isles that 's not english can be replaced with english stereotypes . 
  they do n't really exist for stereotypes . 
  no scottish stereotypes ? 
  you 're missing out - we 're very mockable . 
   i do n't believe florida was ever a territory of the uk ? 
  you 're technically correct !, 
  but florida was owned by the kingdom of great britain from 1763 until 1783 and i count that as `` my country '' . 
  i 've been to florida and to malta . 
  never really think about britain 's colonial past ( or present ) and when i think about foreign countries i do n't think about them in terms of `` former colonies '' . 
  the wars of scottish independence . 
  are you asking about coffee brands or coffee shop brands ? 
  really depends on the context . 
  i would n't think it was odd to see a union flag flying from a public building but i would never fly one from my house . 
  if i did , i think people would assume i was some sort of hardcore unionist , rather than someone merely flying their country 's flag . 
  noooooo , come to scotland !, 
  there have been unicorns on the royal coat of arms of scotland since at least 1672 , so it 's probably not an american invention . 
  good ane . 
  op , i really wish you had n't asked about * english * people in your title and then * british * people in your comments as now it 's hard to tell which group people are answering about . 
  do people outside the uk think of everyone from here as just being british or do they differentiate english , scottish , welsh and northern irish people ? 
  if so , do english tourists really have a different reputation from other british tourists ? 
  [ the athens of the north . 
  ] ( http://www.ewht.org.uk/learning/athens/why-athens-of-the-north ), 
  camping on land without permission of the landowner is criminal trespass in scotland * but * anything done while exercising your access rights under the land reform scotland act 2003 does not amount to trespass . 
  the official guidance is :  access rights extend to wild camping . 
  this type of camping is lightweight , done in small numbers and only for two or three nights in any one place . 
  you can camp in this way wherever access rights apply , but help to avoid causing problems for local people and land managers by not camping in enclosed fields of crops or farm animals and by keeping well away from buildings , roads or historic structures . 
  take extra care to avoid disturbing deer stalking or grouse shooting . 
  if you wish to camp close to a house or building , seek the owner 's permission . 
  so , yes , you have the right to camp on land provided that it 's land you have access rights over and it 's `` wild camping '' . 
  you ca n't permanently live in a caravan on someone 's land without permission and you ca n't pitch your tent in the middle of a golf course but you can camp anywhere that is n't specifically excluded . 
  you 're not obligated to leave if asked by the landowner . 
  if you think the landowner has a good reason for asking you to leave then obviously you would move on - perhaps you did n't realise how close you were camped to a house , or that shooting was going to be taking place nearby . 
  if you decide not to leave when asked and you 're not breaking the law then there is n't anything the landowner can do . 
  if the landowner thinks you are committing criminal trespass by , for example , camping so close to a house that it interferes with the privacy of the houses 's residents , then the landowner can call the police . 
  if the landowner thinks you are committing civil trespass then he can petition the courts for an order to have you removed . 
  even if you think someone is trespassing on your land , you do n't have the right to use force to evict them . 
  as the other commenter said , probably fox hunting . 
  the dogs would probably by beagles or foxhounds . 
  hunting is only supposed to be done with the land-owners permission . 
  i said that hunting with dogs is illegal now in england , but hunting still goes on in various forms , some more legal than others . 
  one type is drag hunting , where the dogs follow a previously laid-down artificial sent trail and hunters follow on horseback . 
  this is legal , as there 's no animal being hunted . 
  however , there have been cases where hunters have used drag hunting as a cover for illegal fox hunting . 
  there also some exceptions in the law that hunters use . 
  using dogs to kill prey is specifically banned but using dogs to flush prey to shoot or to be hunted by a bird of prey is legal , so some hunters have started doing this . 
  or , at least they * say * that 's what they 're doing ; animal rights campaigners maintain that since the ban was passed there has n't actually been a reduction in the amount of fox hunting . 
  it can do . 
  you have the right to access land for recreational purposes ( horse riding , cycling , camping , etc. ), 
  or educational purposes or some commercial purposes or to cross over land or water . 
  you do n't have access rights if you 're going to hunt , shoot or fish or use any motorised vehicle or commit any criminal offence . 
  access rights do n't apply to : houses and gardens , non-residential buildings and associated land , land in which crops are growing , sports fields when they are in use , golf courses ( though you can cross golf courses when it does n't interfere with play ) , visitor attractions which charge for entry , airfields , railways , military bases , working quarries and construction sites . 
  edit : but yeah , if you see a mountain you want to climb or a wood you want to walk in or a meadow you want to camp in then you do n't have to ask permission , you just do it . 
  equally , it 's on you to be responsible and not to damage anything or cause any nuisance . 
  it 's expensive but i do n't know if it 's highway robbery - it ca n't be cheap to maintain a country estate and pay for gamekeepers , guides , drivers and so on . 
  more than 80 % of the land in scotland is available for camping and hiking because you have the right here to use most types of land for recreation as long as you use it responsibly .
