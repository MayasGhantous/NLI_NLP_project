  i had a quick wee google for shooting here in scotland and it seems to be # 20 to # 40 per bird for managed shooting where you get driven round the estate and beaters flush game for you to shoot . 
  it 's a lot cheaper for `` rough shooting '' though , where you wander around with your dog and shoot whatever you flush yourself . 
  i think there 's definitely a class aspect to it because i ca n't imagine ever bringing myself to spend that kind of money on shooting animals , even if money was no object . 
  # 40 to shoot a grouse !, 
  crazy !, 
  and , like you said , they just end up on the bonfire unless you can find someone that wants hundreds of dead game birds . 
  you pay the fees to a country estate , then you visit the estate and go shooting there . 
  the animals are n't exactly `` brought in '' as they live on the estate , however the estate will have a gamekeeper whose job is to maintain a healthy stock of game animals . 
  i think this is going to be one of those topics that 's really different between countries . 
  `` hunting '' in the uk usually refers to hunting with hounds - a practice so controversial that it was banned in scotland in 2002 and in england and wales in 2005 but is still legal in northern ireland . 
  `` shooting '' here means shooting game birds such as grouse or pheasant . 
  this is seen as a pastime for the very well-off due to the high cost involved - around # 25 / $ 32 / $ 36 per bird . 
  these shoots usually take place at country estates and can be quite formal affairs . 
  `` deer stalking '' is hunting deer using a rifle . 
  this is also quite an expensive hobby - around # 500 / $ 640 / $ 710 per stag and half that per hind . 
  i would say that the stereotype here is that hunting and shooting is an upper-class pastime . 
  the opposite in fact - lots jobs in the aerospace industry are actually on the occupation shortage list , so non-eea citizens applying for one of those jobs are more likely to be granted a work visa for the uk . 
  more generally , i ca n't think of any jobs here that actually require you to be a british citizen . 
  joining the armed forces or standing for election is limited to `` only '' fifty-four different nationalities . 
  we had rounders at primary school and non-stop cricket and softball at secondary . 
  i can see why you might be confused  the british baseball federation is the body that oversees american-style baseball in the uk . 
  the international baseball board is the body that oversees [ british baseball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_baseball ) world-wide , though in practice this only means england and wales . 
  i actually had to look up `` british baseball '' because it 's unknown here in scotland . 
  `` baseball '' here only means the american-style game . 
  yes to both ; we 've got the [ british american football association national leagues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bafa_national_leagues ) and the [ british baseball federation leagues . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baseball_in_the_united_kingdom ) they 're both small compared to other sports . 
  i 'd say american football was bigger than baseball , though that might only be true in my part of the country . 
  a munro is any mountain in scotland higher than 3,000 feet / 910 metres . 
  they 're named after sir hugh munro , who produced the first list of such mountains . 
  munro-bagging is climbing these mountains with the eventual aim of having climbed all 282 . 
  i think they currently use signatures to authorise card payments . 
  as i understand it , us banks are looking at moving to chip and pin but they 're worried that retailers wo n't want to purchase the pin terminals so the banks might adopt chip and signature instead . 
  chip and pin is the name for the uk 's implementation of the emv smart card technology . 
  you insert your card into the [ card reader ] ( http://mr-west.uk/igcse/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/10/chip-and-pin-reader.jpg ) , enter your pin and the card reader talks with a chip on the card to authenticate you . 
  some cards can use rfid technology to communicate with the card reader - branded as `` contactless '' - but it 's not required . 
   i know nationalism is n't big anywhere in europe ... really ? 
  it 's only been 16 months since 47 % of the people in scotland said they wanted scotland to be an independent country . 
  that seems like a not-insignificant amount of nationalism to me . 
  and scottish nationalism pales in comparison to irish nationalism . 
  i actually came across a video of that version while i was looking for a link for my post but i did n't use it as it was n't the version i was familiar with . 
  it seems that the `` hark , when the night is falling '' version was written by cliff hanley , a scotsman , and the `` let italy boast of her gay gilded waters '' version was written by john mcdermott , a scottish-born canadian , so maybe the mcdermott version is better known on your side of the atlantic ? 
  yeah , we 've got a few patriotic songs here . 
  there are quite a few that are from the jacobite risings ( the failed attempt to return the deposed james vii to the throne of great britain ) . 
  the best-known are : - [ the skye boat song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ctxa-fukc )  speed , bonnie boat , like a bird on the wing ,  onward !, 
  the sailors cry ;  carry the lad that 's born to be king  over the sea to skye . 
  - [ bonnie dundee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av2-a-igojk )  to the lords of convention 't was clavers who spoke . 
   ` ere the king 's crown shall fall there are crowns to be broke ;  so let each cavalier who loves honour and me ,  come follow the bonnet of bonny dundee . 
   came ye by killicrankie , o ? 
  you mentioned the different parts of the uk having different anthems but there is n't even a fixed scottish unofficial anthem - different songs are used at different events . 
  - [ flower of scotland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vkyicdn834 )  o flower of scotland ,  when will we see  your like again ,  that fought and died for ,  your wee bit hill and glen ,  and stood against him ,  proud edward 's army ,  and sent him homeward ,  to think again . 
  this song is about the battle of bannockburn ( 1314 ) , an important battle in the first war of scottish independence . 
  it 's used as the anthem at scottish rugby union and association football matches and at the commonwealth games . 
  - [ scotland the brave ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzk2pwvqyx0 )  hark , when the night is falling !, 
   hear , hear the pipes are calling !, 
   loudly and proudly calling down through the glen . 
   there where the hills are sleeping ,  now feel the blood a-leaping ,  high as the spirits of the old highland men . 
  this was popular as an anthem in the 1980 's but has since been over-taken by flower of scotland . 
  some other contenders for national anthem are [ scots wha hae ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgskbclwz68 ) , [ highland cathedral ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dryzohnbi70 ) and [ is there for honest poverty . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwmk4jxu-sw ) edit : oh yeah , patriotic symbols . 
  there 's the [ flag of scotland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_scotland ) and the [ royal banner of the royal arms of scotland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_standard_of_scotland ) , though use of the latter is actually restricted to officials representing the sovereign in scotland . 
  the scottish floral emblem is the thistle , as seen in things like the [ logo for scottish rugby . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/scottish_rugby_logo.svg/896px-scottish_rugby_logo.svg.png ) and not really a symbol as such but you 'll often see tartan used to indicate scottishness . 
  [ this photo of the `` tartan army '' ( scottish football supporters ) sums up scottish patriotism . 
  ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/3841858 ) also , this is obviously just scottish stuff - there 's lots of british patriotic stuff too , like * rule britannia * , which you mentioned . 
  you revolted against the whole of great britain but only england are worth rooting against ? 
  you 're saying scotland are so shite that we 're not even worth rooting against ? 
  yeah that sounds about right :(, 
   well i 'm american , so the only dog i have in this fight is rooting against england lol . 
  why would you want england to lose , just because you 're american ? 
  to answer the question you added with your edit : each teams plays each other team once . 
  teams are awarded two points for winning , one point for drawing and no points for losing . 
  the team with the most points at the end of the competition is the overall winner . 
  if teams are equal on points then the winner is decided based on points scored during matches . 
  last year 's result was : team | won | drawn | lost | points : - :| : - :| : - :| : - :| : - : ireland | 4 | 0 | 1 | 8 england | 4 | 0 | 1 | 8 wales | 4 | 0 | 1 | 8 france | 2 | 0 | 3 | 4 italy | 1 | 0 | 4 | 2 scotland | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 ireland had scored 119 points during their games and conceded 56 points , so they ended up with a `` points difference '' of +63 . 
  england had +57 and wales had +53 so ireland were the tournament winners . 
  as you suspected , this kind of a tournament is more like a league or the group stage of the fifa world cup than it is like a knock-out tournament . 
  / \u02c8s\u0259\u028avi\u0259t /, 
  * but pleasures are like poppies spread , * * you seize the flower , its bloom is shed ; * * or like the snow falls in the river , * * a moment white - then melts for ever ; * * or like the borealis race , * * that flit ere you can point their place ; * * or like the rainbow 's lovely form , * * evanishing amid the storm . 
  / u/osmyrn mentioned our `` official '' national dish of haggis , neeps and tatties so i thought i 'd mention our `` unofficial '' one - [ the munchy box .

  when i stayed in paris there was a beer vending machine in my hotel but that was a while ago i 've no idea how common they are today . 
  yes , we would have had our first flag in 1957 , then it would have been changed in 1973 , 1981 , 1986 , 1995 , 2004 , 2007 and 2013 . 
  yes , that 's it . 
  he wanted to build a golf resort in scotland but the local government declined his application because of the environmental damage it would do . 
  trump then got the scottish government to overturn the decision and went ahead with building the resort . 
  some local people did n't want to move out and trump pretty much went to war with them to try and get them to move away . 
  the resort ended up only creating a small fraction of the number of jobs that trump said it would . 
  trump then turned on his former friends in the scottish government when they granted permission for an offshore wind farm that would be visible from his resort . 
  he engaged in a lengthy legal and pr battle that finally ended a few days ago when the supreme court rejected his efforts to block the turbines from being built . 
  i 'm not sure i can adequately explain just how hated donald trump is here in scotland . 
  are you familiar with donald trump 's history here ? 
  if you 're not then i 'll tell you the whole story but the most recent development is that he 's been stripped of the honorary degree he had from a scottish university and he 's been stripped of his `` business ambassador '' status by the scottish government . 
   my birthplace 45 \u00b0 n. 
  for all you europeans playing at home , that 's as far north as venice . 
  i live at 56 \u00b0 n and that does n't feel * that * far north compared to some other countries . 
  the fact that a video exists called [ why the uk election results are the worst in history by cgp grey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rgx91rq5i ) should give you some idea of how well democracy works here . 
  i do n't know enough about the parties in other countries to know who i 'd vote for , but perhaps you could suggest some ?
