  this is uncommon in scottish state schools but it might be common in independent schools like hogwarts . 
  do the people at hogwarts wear academic dress ? 
  albania has the highest marriage rate in europe and turkey has the highest fertility rate . 
  academic dress for undergraduate students is a [ scarlet gown ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/st_andrews_gowns.jpg ) though this is only very rarely used these days . 
  those being awarded a bachelor 's degree wear a black gown with a hood trimmed in white fur and lined with the colour appropriate to their degree . 
  [ these yellow-lined hoods indicate that the people wearing them have been awarded science degrees . 
  ] ( https://blog.dundee.ac.uk/one-dundee/files/2016/06/1-bsc.jpg ) those being awarded a master 's degree wear the same black robe but with a different style of hood . 
  [ these people are being awarded master of literature degrees . 
  ] ( https://blog.dundee.ac.uk/one-dundee/files/2016/06/1-mlitt.jpg ) those being awarded a doctorate wear [ a blue gown with facings indicating the type of doctorate the wearer has . 
  ] ( http://app.dundee.ac.uk/pressoffice/contact/2006/october/graduation2.jpg ) edit : my answer was just for the university i went to ; other universities will have their own particular style of academic dress though they 're all along roughly similar lines as they 're all descended from the same medieval robes . 
   electing our president i thought michael higgins beat mary mcaleese in a trial by combat ? 
  i would n't want us to change from being a parliamentary monarchy but the system the uk uses for general elections ( called first-past-the-post ) is simply awful and pretty much any voting system would be an improvement . 
  elections for the scottish parliament use mixed member proportional and elections for local government in scotland use single transferable vote , both of which produce much more sensible results . 
  it was popular to play during games lessons at school because it was indoor and did n't need much space , but other than that it 's not popular here . 
  the nba would be a very niche interest and i 've never even heard of euroleague . 
  i do n't have any stats but if you go by the stories on bbc news ' sport page ( hopefully a useful metric ) then the top-tier sports here are : association football , formula 1 , cricket , rugby union , rugby league , tennis , golf and athletics . 
  what would you do with \u27e8 ch \u27e9 , seeing as that can sound like / t\u0283 / ( as in * chicken * ) , / \u0283 / ( as in * chef * ) or / x / ( as in * loch * ) ? 
  that 's a good point , ligatures and diacritics seem to be obsolete in english now . 
  you never see zo\u00eb or co\u00f6perative or \u00e6sthetic or f\u0153tus . 
  very little . 
  this is the opening of the 1917 novel * a princess of mars : *  i am a very old man ; how old i do not know . 
  possibly i am a hundred , possibly more ; but i can not tell because i have never aged as other men , nor do i remember any childhood . 
  so far as i can recollect i have always been a man , a man of about thirty . 
  i appear today as i did forty years and more ago , and yet i feel that i can not go on living forever ; that some day i shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection . 
  i do not know why i should fear death , i who have died twice and am still alive ; but yet i have the same horror of it as you who have never died , and it is because of this terror of death , i believe , that i am so convinced of my mortality . 
  are n't christians religious by definition ? 
  in the last census here ( in scotland ) , 2.8 million people said they were christian and 1.9 million people said they had no religion but it was n't possible to say that you were a christian who did n't practice a religion . 
  what are you defining as a secular country ? 
  you listed england , which has a state religion so i 'm guessing you do n't mean `` secular '' in an official sense ? 
  when i think of `` student politics '' here , i do n't think of conservatism or liberalism , i think of left-wing ideologies like social democracy and socialism . 
  * thanks mr higgins . 
  i 'm sorry i said `` british isles '' on reddit and i wo n't do it again . 
  i do n't want to let you down . 
   4.11 '' i initially read this as four point eleven inches tall - around ten centimetres !, 
  they are , but as wikipedia puts it :  the british isles also include three crown dependencies : the isle of man and , by tradition , the bailiwick of jersey and the bailiwick of guernsey in the channel islands , although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago . 
  the wikipedia page for * wyspy brytyjskie * does n't mention the channel islands , so i guess polish people have a more strict definition ? 
  no the wee man !, 
  argh !, 
  aww , come on !, 
  i prefaced that with `` traditionally '' * and * explained that it 's a controversial usage !, 
  i 'm sure the lovely people of ireland will understand my use of the word in an educational context , 
  yes . 
  american comedy films and tv shows are not popular here because we find the humour confusing . 
  for example , a character can say something and not mean it because they are being `` sarcastic '' . 
  i just do n't see the appeal of such humour . 
  traditionally , yes , `` the british isles '' covers the uk , ireland , the isle of man , the bailiwick of jersey and the bailiwick of guernsey . 
  it 's an unpopular term in ireland though and they would like people to stop using it since it can be seen as implying that ireland is `` british '' in some geographic sense . 
  you are correct . 
  sarcasm is unknown in england . 
  they do n't even have a word for the concept . 
  ok , there 's a country called the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , usually just known as the united kingdom . 
  people from the united kingdom are called british people in the same way that people from the united states are called americans . 
  [ the uk is divided internally into four areas , a little bit like states in federal countries . 
  ] ( https://www.visitengland.com/sites/default/files/map_of_uk_600x675px_1.jpg ) these are called scotland , england , wales and northern ireland . 
  someone from england is also british in the way that someone from texas is also american . 
  equally , not all americans are texans and not all british people are english - many will be scots , welsh and northern irish . 
  i had an american woman ask if i was english ( which i 'm not ) but it 's possible that she was asking if i was british ( which i am ) and just using the wrong term . 
  `` government '' in the british sense of the word or the american sense ? 
  if the former then it looks like we 're getting a tory / dup coalition government , which is pretty much the opposite of what i 'd want . 
  i 'm a native english speaker and i ken a wee bitty scots too . 
  i studied german from ages 12 to 16 and have forgotten virtually all of it . 
  article 10 of the european convention on human rights is probably a good place to start :  everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
  this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . 
  this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting , television or cinema enterprises . 
  the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . 
  in the uk , `` free speech '' does not protect abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment , alarm or distress ; sending someone a message which is indecent or grossly offensive with an intent to cause distress ; incitement ; promoting terrorism ; defamation ; restrictions on court reporting ; privileged communications ; trade secrets ; classified material ; copyright ; patents and limitations on commercial speech such as advertising standards . 
  the wars of scottish independence . 
  virtually non-existent . 
  our olympic wrestling team in 2012 was mostly ukrainians who had been hurriedly granted british citizenship . 
  if you 're a european citizen or resident then you can get an interrail pass ; if not then you can get a eurail pass . 
  the eurail pass costs more depending on how many countries you visit so if you wanted to go , say , czech republic to germany to france to italy then you could get the $ 170 `` select pass '' . 
  if you want to visit five or more countries then you need the $ 305 `` global pass '' , though of course you could buy the cheaper pass and then just buy a single ticket to visit , say , austria . 
  edit : these passes allow you to take up to ten `` travel days '' so if you 're thinking of travelling more than that then you 'll want to look at another option . 
  celtic are * the hoops * and rangers are * the blues * because of the design of their kits . 
  dundee united are * the tangerine terrors * because of the ( awful ) colour of their kit . 
  motherwell are * the steelmen * due to their industrial heritage . 
  i think livingston are * the lions * and kilmarnock are * the killies * just because those sound good . 
  edinburgh 's teams are actually named hibernian and heart of midlothian . 
  aberdeen are probably called * the dons * because the city lies on the river don but it might also be a contraction of aberdonians . 
  falkirk are * the bairns * ( scots for * the children * ) because of the saying `` better meddle with the deil than the bairns of falkirk '' , but nobody knows where the saying comes from . 
  nobody seems to know why dunfermline athletic are * the pars , * the only theories seem to involve the parallel lines on their kit ... bit of a stretch , i reckon . 
  i 'd guess they would just use the city name and the team 's nickname : aberdeen dons , glasgow hoops , glasgow blues , dundee terrors , dunfermline pars , falkirk bairns , edinburgh hearts , edinburgh hibees , kilmarnock killies , livingston lions and motherwell steelmen . 
  no idea what you 'd do with inverness caledonian thistle fc though !, 
  yeah , i 've got a tan on my arms just from being outside . 
  where i live , the sun is up from half four in the morning until ten at night , so it 's hard to avoid getting a bit of sun !, 
  i think comparing bernie sanders with jeremy corbyn is fair , as much as you can compare across countries . 
  a manifesto is a document that parties publish before an election that lays out what they would do if they were elected . 
  is that the same as a * party platform * or * program * in american english ? 
  * manifesto * does n't have any negative connotations here ; interesting that it 's `` taboo '' in american english !, 
  i know ; i was just messing with you !, 
  anyway , i 'm not sure we really have an equivalent idiom . 
  probably just a quick `` whoops , sorry '' . 
  shit , fuck , cunt ... that sort of thing . 
  where i live , almost all healthcare is provided free at the point of use , including prosthetic limbs . 
  i 've never heard of this . 
  do you have any photos or anything ? 
   agriculture : impose restrictions and tariffs on imported food , which american farmers can not compete with . 
  break up larger farms , and increase the amount of small , family-owned farms . 
  sounds like a heavy intervention in the market : left-wing . 
   minimum wage : raise the nationwide minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 15 .
