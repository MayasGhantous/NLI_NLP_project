  nah , ca n't be france because of our * vieille alliance * against england . 
  i 'm struggling to think of answer for a country that my country would want to kill that would n't be in incredibly poor taste because we have actually tried to kill those people at some point in history .

  it was originally the flag of the order of st patrick ( a chivalric order created in 1783 by george iii ) but came to be used as a flag for all of ireland . 
  it has occasionally been used as a flag for northern ireland but the official flag is the ulster banner - a red cross on a white field with a crowned six-pointed star with a red hand in the centre . 
  i think she 's fantastic . 
  she 's lead this country since 1952 and never really put a foot wrong . 
  and we 're living in an era where a serious mis-step by the monarch could mean the end of the monarchy .

  i like the arizona design . 
  the nyc and la ones both have seals on them , which does n't make for a good flag . 
  in fact , i would say they were more like banners than flags . 
  i would guess that 's not such a clear distinction in the usa though ? 
  banners here are like flags except they feature heraldic designs , [ such as this .

  english actually has words that are their own opposites , such as * dust * ( which can mean both removing dust , as in dusting a shelf , or adding dust , as in dusting a cake ) or * oversight * ( which can mean both close scrutiny and an error made through lack of scrutiny ) . 
  monday . 
  yeah , they 're pretty classic designs . 
  [ the uk flag is actually a combination of three flags . ], 
  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/flags_of_the_union_jack.png ) or were you suggesting that only two of the flags in it complemented each other ? 
  what do you think of the flags of [ the uk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/flag_of_the_united_kingdom.svg ) and [ scotland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/flag_of_scotland.svg ) and the [ royal banner of scotland ?

   new mexico yeah that 's a proper flag , 
  it 's iconic but i 'd agree with / u/marelen that , from a design point of view , it is a bit busy ( though it 's light years ahead of us state and city flags ) . 
  perhaps you could say why you think that 's something worth avoiding ? 
  it 's not immediately clear to me why people in the eu starting to consider themselves as members of a european nation would be a bad thing .

  there 's an interesting article [ here ] ( https://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/spastic-learning-disability.html ) on how words can have different levels of offensiveness in different dialects . 
  in american english , `` spaz '' is a very mild insult but in british english it 's ( according to a 2003 survey ) the second-worst disability-related insult there is ( after * retard * ) . 
  there 's a few that come to mind . 
  there used to be a charity here called * the spastics society * who supported people with cerebral palsy . 
  * spastic * went from being a medical term to a playground insult and the charity ended up changing its name to * scope . 
  * another example is in the 80 's tv programme * the young ones . 
  * in one scene , a character is ringing a doorbell when a policeman jumps out of a nearby bush and apprehends him for `` wasting white man 's electricity '' . 
  the man ringing the doorbell is confused , since he is white himself . 
  the policeman notices the man 's confusion , thinks for a second and then removes the sunglasses he is wearing , which had caused him to see the other man as being black . 
  `` sorry '' , the policeman says , `` i thought you was a nigger . '', 
  now , at the time this was n't an acceptable thing to say but it was ok to show on tv since the point was to satirise police racism . 
  since then , the word * nigger * has become so taboo that the last time i saw that episode aired , they cut that whole scene out even though i do n't think it 's an inappropriate word in the context . 
   is there a `` clean '' weapon producer ? 
  probably some of the companies that only produce sporting guns , like holland & holland or james purdey & sons . 
  yeah , apparently there are 150,000 jewish people in london . 
  according to the last census there were only 5,887 jewish people in scotland ( around 0.1 % of the population ) . 
  i do n't think i 've ever met one though of course it 's possible i have and just not known . 
  people are generally pretty private about religion here . 
  well , there 's an eu country missing - rather a bold choice for a map of europe !,

  it 's certainly a very special place . 
  a magical land where the wild haggises roam the misty glens . 
   leiden university in holland technically correct !, 
  the best kind of correct !, 
  - true : we do drink quite a lot ( the equivalent of 41 bottles of vodka or 116 bottles of wine per adult per year ) . 
  - false : we do n't generally wear kilts day-to-day ; just on special occasions . 
  if you 're not running a decent-sized business then you do n't need to worry about vat . 
  in the case above you would pay $ 15 to the record store and they would take $ 12.50 for themselves and $ 2.50 as vat . 
  when you sold the cd for $ 75 you would n't pay vat on that , since you 're not a vat-registered business . 
  if you were such a business then you 'd sell the cd for $ 75 and keep $ 62.50 for yourself and pay $ 12.50 as vat . 
  however , you would reclaim the vat you paid to purchase the cd in the first place , so you only effectively pay the difference : $ 12.50 - $ 2.50 = $ 10 . 
  it 's a bit complicated but there 's an example [ here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/value-added_tax#with_a_value-added_tax ) the very short version is that businesses are motivated to collect the taxes from the people they sell to ( regardless of whether they are consumers , retailers , wholesales or manufacturers ) because they in turn want to be able to use they vat they collect to offset they money they 've spent on vat when purchasing from people before them in the supply chain ( or just from service providers ) . 
  yes , though there was also a kingdom of great britain . 
  americans may know this as they country they declared independence from , 
  just in case anyone did n't get that you were joking - gibraltar is a british territory but it 's not part of the united kingdom . 
  the singular `` kingdom '' is to make it clear that the uk was now one kingdom , as opposed to the two kingdoms that it replaced . 
  kellogg 's : coco pops ( chocolate-coated rice krispies ) , ricicles ( sugar-frosted rice krispies ) , frosties ( sugar-coated cornflakes ) , krave ( chocolate or nutella-filled cereal ) , nestle : choco / frosted shreddies ( chocolate or sugar-coated wholewheat ) , cookie crisp , nesquik cereal ( chocolate cereal ) , lion cereal ( chocolate and caramel cereal ) .

  i would support us taking in asylum seekers from any country because everyone has the right to apply for asylum ( according to the udhr , which the uk is a signatory to ) . 
  i would support asylum seekers from any country being given refugee status if they meet the criteria .

  i think , strictly speaking , sa80 is the family to which the the uk 's service rifle - the l85 - belongs . 
  that 's sparse by european standards but i do n't think it 's as extreme as you get in the usa . 
   is there anywhere like this in europe , that is just really empty and people hate driving through , but is possibly hard to avoid if making a trip from one side of europe to the other by car ? 
  not really , no .
