  1 ) it was less than hour after the first reports , and the details were not even 100 % known other than that there were deaths . 
  hardly asking for radio silence , when i said the blood had n't dried , the blood had literally probably not dried . 
  2 ) who is defending the saudi campaign against yemen ? 
  who here has the power to stop the sale of those weapons ? 
  who has defended the deaths of civilians in a campaign fought with british weapons ? 
  this is just a deflection , and is completely irrelevant . 
   stop being so egotistical and demanding that irish people drop what they 're doing and come running when something bad happens in your country . 
  ahh , i see . 
  `` something bad '' = `` deaths of 4 innocents , many others wounded '' . 
  bonus round - i did n't demand `` the irish people '' did anything . 
  i asked you to stop defending civilian murders . 
  no-one else , just you . 
   you voted for the nasty ultranationalism . 
  so why should i care ? 
  52 % vote dto leave a political bloc . 
  many of us [ absolutely did not ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4pm8u5/post_brexit_vote_discussions_recriminations/d4n0iqa/?context=3#d4mzwoo ) . 
  not that it would excuse your pithy schadenfreude either way . 
   it will be great not having to worry in the slightest about the uk sponsoring loyalist militias that plant bombs or slit people 's throats isis-style . 
  having to indulge that `` kulture '' in case they start rioting or killing with implicit support from london . 
  oh yeah , what actually happens is all the politicians come from all over the uk , sit down and say `` what 's the best way to kill the irish ? '', 
  that 's it , you 've got it . 
  this is definitely not you being incredibly reductionist . 
   it will be great not having to listen to requests/demands that ireland join the commonwealth , or show more respect to queen elizabeth , or apologise for seceding . 
  i have no idea why you think that 's an external pressure from britain on the grounds that the commonwealth is largely symbolic and does n't do a whole lot , but either way i dare you to find a single person from britain who wants ireland to `` apologise for seceding '' , or `` show more respect to queen elizabeth '' . 
  this is an imaginary fight . 
   it will great not having to put up with your obsession with being a great power and `` sovereignty '' , which in practice seems to include the freedom to be as cruel , condescending , and obnoxious to irish people as you like . 
  jesus , listen to yourself for goodness sake . 
  most people are getting along fine in our countries . 
  you 're so incredibly xenophobic that you 've completely closed your eyes to reality . 
   `` why should i let others censor what i say '' \u2194 `` stop trying to distract from the point '' in what world do these mean the same ? 
  `` enough of this argument , did you see the news ? '', 
  `` stop distracting me from my point '' vs `` enough of this argument , did you see the news ? '', 
  `` why should others censor me ? '', 
  it literally does n't make sense the second way . 
  that 's a pisspoor backtrack . 
   `` compassion ? 
  what has england done ... '' \u2194 '' [ fuck off ] and stop trying to guilt trip me '' yeah , this is the problem . 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that most people would n't call `` please stop arguing about when civilians deserve to die until the blood has dried on the most recent civilian attack '' a `` guilt trip '' . 
  i would say that most people would call that `` common sense '' or `` having a heart '' . 
   i 'm telling the truth when i say i 'm generally not bothered about these kinds of debates . 
  which is why 90 % of your post history is comments attacking the uk and posting about how great it 'll be if the uk gets fucked by brexit , right ? 
  because you just do n't care . 
  the bit where , after i said  you ca n't even stop defending a campaign of killing totally innocent people to inflict terror on a day where totally innocent people were just murdered , most likely to inflict terror you said :  why should i let others censor what i say ? 
  [ ... ] do you not think it 's a bit silly to allow myself to be influenced by events in a foreign country ? 
  upon which i responded :  ... no ? 
  not even slightly ? 
  i think it would be the norm , and would show compassion . 
  [ ... ] i hoped you 'd have it in you to feel terrible for the people who died today , but apparently that 's a bridge too far . 
  and you said :  compassion ? 
  what has england ever done for me ? 
  all i hear out of you is demands . 
  how else can it be read other than you have no compassion and do n't care about what happened ? 
  you all but use those exact words . 
  we can finagle if you want , but it 's right there . 
  you , in fact , never once said i was trying to distract from the point ( and it would n't have made much sense if you had , on the grounds i was arguing killing any unarmed , disaffiliated civilian is morally wrong in all circumstances ) . 
  i have absolutely no idea why you 've posted this to me . 
  here 's what i said :  i had an argument with the same goon in another thread , where they just out and out stated that innocent civilians deserved to die and that they had no sympathy for the attacks yesterday . 
  yeah ? 
  now , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60m2dp/sinn_feins_martin_mcguinness_dies_at_66/df7svvk/ ) is a post where / u/cuntais _ eile directly stated that if innocent civilians in the uk did n't `` want to get blown up '' , it 's their own fault , plus the civilian killings `` worked '' because they `` put the absolute fear into the british elites , state , security services , and ordinary people '' ; [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60m2dp/sinn_feins_martin_mcguinness_dies_at_66/dfakysv/ ) is where , after they kept saying that they thought it 'd be `` a bit silly to allow myself to be influenced by events in a foreign country '' that they had no compassion for the victims of the attacks yesterday . 
  to be blunt , i do n't feel like i 've said anything actually incorrect and , whilst i 'm happy that you do n't share the same views as that person , you 're neither the one i was addressing , nor were you involved at all . 
  you 've jumped in to take offense on someone else 's behalf . 
   it 's also not fucking funny when people think that just because you recognise why someone did something extreme and cruel that it must mean you agree with them . 
  i 'm not laughing . 
  i 'm sickened , and definitely do n't see the funny side . 
   doing that would mean recognising that britain made the ira most people understand the fact that bad things happening over long periods of time breeds hatred . 
  do you see the difference between `` some of the things the ira did were unconscionable but ultimately a reaction to oppression '' and `` innocent people deserve to be murdered by bombs because they were born the wrong nationality , and i do n't care at all that more were killed yesterday '' ? 
  that 's the difference we 're talking about here . 
  for fucks sake , just browse through their history for 5 minutes - it 's almost entirely anti-british diatribes . 
  evidently , you and they are not on the same page here . 
   it 's an ugly truth which is just too difficult for people like you to face . 
  you have no idea who i am or what i 've done , so less posturing about what i do and do n't believe would be appreciated , cheers . 
  it 's not worth it mate . 
  i had an argument with the same goon in another thread , where they just out and out stated that innocent civilians deserved to die and that they had no sympathy for the attacks yesterday . 
  you might as well argue with a wall , this ones barely human . 
  it 's still not an ad hominem . 
  that 's not an ad hominem either . 
  as i said , sad and pathetic . 
  i hope you 're still 12 . 
   in any case , why should i let others censor what i say ? 
  others ? 
  no , your own conscience . 
  most people would have enough of a heart to feel something towards the needlessly murdered victims . 
   imagine the anger you 'd see if ireland did n't attend the remembrance day ceremony i mean , i would bet most people outside of people in ireland and daily mail readers would n't care at all ( i doubt most people even realise that ireland has remembrance day at all , it 's never covered in the mainland of the uk ) and if the non-attendance was picked up in the news , it 'd be more around whether tensions in the area were rising again for fear of violence rather than anything else . 
  there 's usually almost no coverage of what happens in ireland in the british press , and what there is tends to be around either elections or corporations embroiled in some tax dodging scam with the government . 
   do you not think it 's a bit silly to allow myself to be influenced by events in a foreign country ? 
  not even slightly ? 
  i think it would be the norm , and would show compassion . 
  rather , making your emotions for other people stop at some arbitrary borders would be quite unusually callous . 
  would you be saying the same if the attack had happened in france or germany ? 
  i hope not . 
  i mean , i hoped you 'd have it in you to feel terrible for the people who died today , but apparently that 's a bridge too far . 
   first you call me a racist , and now you 're attempting a gandhi imitation . 
  definitely not attempting to be gandhi , and you are 100 % racist . 
  i 'm just saying that if you ca n't even stop defending a campaign of killing totally innocent people to inflict terror on a day where totally innocent people were just murdered , most likely to inflict terror , it 's just slightly pathetic . 
  that you posted this after what 's happened today shows exactly who you are . 
  yesterday , i felt angry that you would justify murdering civilians . 
  now i just feel sad for you , that you 'll always be trapped in your mind , forever tilting at windmills because you 're blinded by hatred . 
  which bit is inaccurate then ? 
  the bit where you defended people bombing innocents because you 're xenophobic or the bit where the house of commons tried to give ni to the republic ? 
   the ira 's mainland strategy worked by the way , it put the absolute fear into the british elites , state , security services , and ordinary people .
