  8.4 % , but it 's # 1 for a half pint . 
  them bastards in herefordshire and kent too . 
  come to the west country sometime , we 've got plenty of cider drinking men . 
  i feel grossly under-represented as a cider drinking man . 
  make tea not war, 
  i expect it 'd be very wet . 
  scotland has a vote to leave us ( spoiler alert : they 're staying ! ) . 
  the scottish first minister 's stepping down from leadership of his party ( personally i think he should have stayed , he 's still first minister and head of the largest party in the scottish parliament ) . 
  there 's talk about devolving more powers to scotland , but england always has to make it about us , so we 're maybe getting an english parliament too - maybe welsh assembly turning to a parliament too , and some more powers to northern ireland . 
  i was accusing it of being false anyways . 
  only time `` nuke '' or `` nuclear '' is used is in the headline . 
  i suspect , it was because [ it hit an explosives factory ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/world/europe/explosion-rocks-eastern-ukraine-hours-after-an-amended-cease-fire-is-signed.html?_r=0 ), 
  edinburgh looks more like cairngorn to me . 
  i think you should base a decision on where to move to on more than internet recommendations . 
  i just want highlands to declare so i can go to bloody bed . 
  democracy wins out !, 
  your lot 're meant to love that shit . 
  like how ankh-morpork is the biggest dwarf city outside of uberwald . 
  oh no just by making that analogy you 've ensured that we lose . 
  we do n't use enough heads in our cooking . 
  that 's plenty of bones for stock and meat ( ish ) for stew . 
  do you know what they say of the acropolis where the parthenon is ? 
  self-determination is n't it . 
  if scotland votes to leave , they leave . 
  so long as the falklands keep voting at 96 % or whatever it is to identifying as british , we 'll keep 'em . 
  you begin to wonder why everyone 's so anti-westminster when mr london above does n't care if it does n't affect them . 
  oops , i was thinking of the wrong war , you 're very right . 
  6 year war * remember also that millions of soldiers 're now going to be coming home from the war - belgium needs belgians to rebuild , and the uk needed jobs for british veterans . 
  oh no that 's the becursiest, 
  flair up so we know which of our becursed sprogs you are . 
  i 'd say if there 's any evidence of what you 're looking for , it 's public voting for parties against the eu . 
  are we britons really notorious for hating/resisting the eu prior to the rise of ukip ? 
  we fought long and hard to get into the club , not our fault that some folks want to throw the toys out of the pram and pretend it 's 1935 and we live in '' [ splendid isolation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/splendid_isolation ) '' with empire and ruling the waves . 
  i have no idea what any of those initialisms mean . 
  could be that different schools/areas do things differently . 
  yes , let 's ignore [ 900 years of independence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_scotland ) . 
  ya das hokey cokey [ ya ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwaxwojpuc0 ), 
  someone 's been playing silly bastards with wikipedia . 
  [ should be frank , i 'll go change it now ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_drake ), 
  the atmosphere . 
  graviational lensing is very small . 
  the whole sun would take [ 550 astronomical units ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gravitational_lens#solar_gravitational_lens ) to lens to a point . 
  do n't forget the ls . 
  they sure love their ls . 
  the upper classes have always been good at working with horses , looking so similar . 
  i 'm trying to say `` even compared to bumblefuck , nowhereshire , things are n't much different '' , it was just a convenient comparison . 
  every time i 've been to london there 's been massive tides of white people . 
  even as someone from the depths of the british countryside , where you might see a single non-white face if you spent all day in the highstreet , london is n't exactly under sharia law . 
  stone , bell , key ... just some people that come to mind that i know . 
  are you confused when you meet john smith and find that he 's not a blacksmith ? 
  or john watson , and find that he 's not the son of wat ? 
  or when john brown is resolutely white ? 
  i believe you can put words next to your flag , so you could mention it there - then have the flag being your current residency ? 
  libel would be if it was written down , slander in the spoken voice is very hard to prove . 
  i do n't think that spreading falsehoods that damage someone should be completely free anyways . 
  absolutely , else politicians would n't be so for it . 
  in the uk , so long as you are n't inciting violence , you can say what you want . 
  anytime london is mentioned i feel the need to swallow down a string of expletives . 
  wait , so the uk as a whole is swearing more often than scotland ? 
  ah , i be from wurzel country we know all abouts that . 
  most ? 
  are they your highest peaks ? 
  poor taste in facial hair, 
  look !, 
  it 's flooded and all !, 
  i 'm with pratchett and gaiman on this one . 
  it 's claimed by heaven and hell alike , and neither side is particularily comfortable having it . 
  that is a pretty prime example of that famous british humour actually . 
  say what you like about chamberlain , but : # 600m extra spent on the military , mostly the raf , 20 % of national product spent on military by the outbreak of war , and he tried to persuade italy to temper german expansionism ( but too late ) . 
  he gets a lot of schtick for appeasement , but he helped make sure we were ready . 
  you mean they do n't have military parity with us already ? 
  quick guys , start up the tanks !, 
  [ here 's some other opinions ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2epyg0/using_this_image_draw_where_you_think_different/ ) . 
  i 'm sorry to hear about your small wien . 
  nope , written by serge for brigitte bardot . 
  apparently it was bardot 's husband who did n't want it released , not birkin 's . 
  - english student, 
  apparently her husband at the time heard it and immediately did n't want it released because it was obvious they were having an affair . 
  he 'd written it for a previous girlfriend . 
  like it or not , ireland and the uk 're very much alike . 
  you can not want to be ruled from somewhere whilst still admitting similarities . 
  sure , baby 's going to cry unless you let it break your watch . 
  who 's the baby , russia ? 
  and the watch the eu ? 
  when was this cartoon made , and what is it really about ? 
  but , if you `` beg '' the us , and they build you the system , then they probably stipulate that they have to run it . 
  so now you have a us base running us missiles whenever the us ( in the base or from stateside ) says so - you can see why that 's more appealing to them that a polish base firing polish missiles ( based on us tech ) whenever poland ( or anyone in the base ) says so . 
  use backslashes to cancel out the italics caused by asterisks . 
  52 \\* 40 \\* 9.32 = usd19 .39 k, 
  dang right there , who needs these invisible lines to divide us ? 
  i had a long history with pissing my pants before i was potty trained , does n't mean if i started again it would n't be surprising . 
  something like 96 % of the uk 's jews live in london , so i 'm not going to claim to know anything , but in my typical rural area , you find people outraged at what israel is up to but entirely non-anti-semitic . 
   ruairi quinn , former president of eu 's finance council , predicts, 
  i can understand why russia wants to invade the balkans now , it 'd make it much simpler . 
  that is n't the point of this thread - it is n't `` america is bad ! '', 
  it 's `` some communities are too filled with americans for me to get information relevant to me '' . 
  nothing to do with who 's in charge or who runs the website . 
  i 'm just here to see what alternative subreddits are around . 
  i 'll admit to being pretty damn cavalier about muh privacy . 
  you complaining about the complaining about american dominated subreddits kinda misses the whole point of subreddits though - i just wanted to chip in on that .
