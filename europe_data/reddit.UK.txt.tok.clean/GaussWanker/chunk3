   how about you fuck off to your own european version of reddit you mean like ... / r/europe ? 
  most of the adverts i see with regards to british food is mostly pointing out the less transport miles , so enviromental friendliness of it . 
  [ yup ] ( http://politicsworldwide.com/journal/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/nick-clegg-tuition-fees-pledge.jpg ), 
  they actually had to slow down the killings , because they could n't burn the bodies fast enough . 
  no real conclusion on what [ raoul moat thought ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_northumbria_police_manhunt#ipcc_investigation_and_inquest ) . 
  typical western gazette , cashing in on the misery of the people . 
  shepton journal , now there 's a responsible local newspaper , the voice of the people . 
  so disallow people based on their religion ? 
  or bar people from coming back to their homes and families ? 
  neither of those options 're apealing to me . 
  you ca n't have action against people who have n't even planned on commiting a crime yet , that 's getting orwellian thoughtcrime . 
  vermont , only openly socialist representative , number 1 state for maple syrup production . 
  it 's practically canada . 
  the problem is that they go and learn how to kill for their god , then if they 're not killed themselves , they come back . 
  i think this is the wrong subreddit , since the picture was taken in kenya . 
  ah gravy , the most important food group . 
  give cheddar a pdo and it 's a deal . 
  they will anyways . 
  they just like to know they have the choice . 
  i do n't know enough about other countries to start suggesting other links . 
  but if you forget about the north welsh they complain . 
  and they do it in their silllllllly wellllllsh too . 
  america is still living in the mccarthy red scare . 
  but three different versions of muhamed joined up and no arguments ? 
  wales and the south west gets shafted again . 
  cutting off at bristol leaves a huge area . 
  i 'd have bristol , southampton , portsmouth and exeter for sures . 
  cardiff and swansea , and a welsh west coast line to bangor ( linking back up at liverpool ) ( and aber to birmingham ) . 
  sheffield gets a stop . 
  a seperate east coast line with hull and newcastle to edinburgh and london and up to aberdeen, 
  so all joes are not josephs ? 
  all bens are not benjamins ? 
  we 've spent the best part of 2000 years fighting the mainland , and you do n't spend that long quarrelling unless it 's the real thing baby . 
  europe , will you marry us ? 
  high speed anything not in london . 
  the south west can go sod itself as far as westminster is concerned . 
  so fieldfield ? 
  nooo not the towels it 's the crack of dawn when did you even put them down, 
  especially you, 
  stuck it right on the fridge where everyone can see . 
  using aid as a trojan horse is illegal in so many ways . 
  ( and we totally did n't do it [ 100 years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rms_lusitania#undeclared_war_munitions ) ), 
  oh definitely , a lot of the buildings around clifton are just generally beautiful too . 
  friend of a friend jumped off the bridge not too long ago and ended it all . 
  aye , and the isle of avalon if i recally correctly . 
  lots of arthurian doohickeys around glastonbury , and some tree supposedly the staff of joseph of arimathea . 
  also a looooot of hippies there . 
  i 'm almost certain that the uk one is not taken in the uk . 
  google reckons it 's 3 hours + by car anyways . 
  mine looks like it all the bloody time for the next week or so . 
  edit : also , the only time that a `` no shirt , no shoes , no service '' sign is up other than during glastonbury festival . 
  some more alternatives , biased as i am by regional preference : [ glastonbury tor ] ( http://www.esotericteachings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/glastonbury-tor-in-somerset.jpg ) ( w / st michael 's tower ) [ durdle door ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/durdle_door_overview.jpg ) and lulworth cove . 
  i reckon the ( new ) severn bridge is pretty impressive , if only because i had to cross it twice a fortnight for a few years . 
  also , not in the south west , tower of london , tower bridge ( y' know , all the tourist crud in london ), 
  nice . 
  being stabbed in the face is a little nicer than leeds . 
  certainly , but i 'm not publishing research based on my agenda without mentioning it - no mention in the independant article of the eugenics society - seems pretty pertinent does n't it ? 
  yeah , everyone else 's has people in suits ( or empty or kids ) we have giant freakin ' robes and a monarch sat in a democratic chamber . 
  since your flair 's scottish , and this is r/europe , i hope it is n't too personal to ask your opinon on which way the scottish referendum 'll go . 
  is that the lords or just a special occassion ? 
  the queen is n't usually in either , i swear . 
  we 're a real democracy !, 
  hmmm , founder of `` migration watch '' and a member of `` the eugenics society '' . 
  i wonder if he has a personal agenda ... 
  hmmm , i wonder why [ i 'm not worried ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/england_ethnicity_estimates_2009.jpg ) . 
  even after the commonwealth and the eu . 
  sure , that 's my principles . 
  never claimed it was everyone 's principles , same as absump did n't add any qualifiers but you 're not complaining , because it happens to match yours . 
  if your principles is `` let people starve , i can do what i want with what 's mine '' , then i disagree with you entirely . 
  we 'll ` ave it . 
  hope they like cider and their own cousins . 
  if you 're principled , you might say that people should n't be starving in the 21st century . 
  but people 're getting hurt by starving because the food is n't being donated . 
  by your own logic , they should be donating yes ? 
  we sent nigel farage over to find out why bulgarian wolves wanted to come to this country . 
  turns out they did n't . 
  he 's also now missing . 
  two birds , as they say .

  truly , a wonderful city . 
  [ non capital cities exist , y' know ] ( http://www.wessexscene.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/unilink1.png ), 
  `` how many paddys does it take to screw in a lightbulb '',

  you noticed what subreddit you 're in ? 
  you noticed what subreddit you 're in ? 
  there 's a term for that , it 's `` apple juice '' . 
  it follows a nice pattern with other non-alcoholic fruit produces , like `` orange juice '' and `` grape juice '' . 
  600 million litres per year , if they do n't we will . 
  2 big cider breweries in my town , stinks of rotten apples half the year . 
  that 's because cider is alcoholic .

  is this sub very left wing ?
