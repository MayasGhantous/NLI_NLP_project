  typical reddit chimney sweep shilling . 
  i like me too !, 
  we have so much in common, 
  i 'm pretty sure `` undying irish spirit '' and `` telling the english to feck off '' are synonyms . 
  i 've seen the same in wells . 
  the kite was just for our jets . 
  are the cats friends ? 
  i could n't make out what she said , remind her that it 's rude to talk with your mouth full . 
  live and learn , every day . 
  london 's got about 13 % of the population for comparison . 
  there 's definitely wild boar , my friend had 9 ( i just went back and found the facebook post of the pictures and counted ) break a load of shit on his farm back in 2010 . 
  and 18 % of the country lives outside of urban areas . 
  that argument does n't hold water . 
  we 're not naggy , we 're just a little needy . 
  hang on let me try again with more emphasis on the rs . 
  buttman is a different movie . 
  there 's the whole west-country south-west of bristol ; somerset , dorset and devon , as well as cornwall . 
  cornwall is the south-westiest of the south-west . 
  the west-country of the west-country . 
  they got drunk in fresher 's week and hooked up and it 's been awkwardness and pretend hatred ever since . 
  i 've taken to wearing braces the last few weeks , usually under my jumper because of hipster allegations , but they really work ( unsurprisingly ) . 
  belts just do n't work for me , i do n't have any waist for them to rest on . 
  i saw a funny comment around the time of the scottish referendum - unionists are people who think that two countries on one island should be one country . 
  unless the island is ireland . 
  everyone really does hate sweden though . 
  i reckon that 'd be a good idea yeah . 
  if nothing else then you can use known finger prints to work out which fingerprints should n't belong somewhere - ie . 
  if every fingerprint bar one in a house belongs to the family that lives there , maybe you 've got the fingerprints of the thief . 
  there 're jewish nazis , that 'd leave him a bit confused . 
  hah those funny ol' nazis . 
  because you ca n't justify eating meat and butter on its own . 
  sandwiches , ice lollies , everything is eaten with cutlery . 
  woh woh woh , let 's not put bogey eating up there with not showering and not wiping your arse . 
  eating with your hands i can maybe understand , but it 's alien to me . 
  this is n't a racial issue , it 's geographical . 
  `` western europe '', 
  typical , they never answer the tough ones . 
  life must 've been very hard in rural areas around the turn of last century - especially as north and cold as some places in norway . 
  i had cereal for dinner because i still need to go shopping . 
  1 part cereal , 1 part milk . 
  or , you can continue to question a deeply unfair economic structure . 
  but hey i 'm just a reddit comment , not a cop . 
  lincolnshire has the most fertile soil in the country . 
  said so on escape to the country . 
  the working class of all species have more in common with each other than with their respective bourgeoisie . 
  no human-penguin war but class war . 
  yeah , and i quoted trotsky too , i 'm not saying marxist-leninism is the answer ( i 'm an anarchist ) - hell i could have quoted hitler himself - `` only one thing could have stopped our movement - if our adversaries had understood its principle and from the first day smashed with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement . '', 
  i 'm sorry if i 'm taking it out on you , but so much of the rhetoric i am seeing on reddit , and if you 're not seeing it then please list me what subs you 're subscribed to so i can avoid it too , is that this is the fault of this boogieman of the ` regressive left ' , that somehow `` being told that you 're saying racist things '' is what has persuaded people to vote trump over * the huge influence that the mass media has , and has had every single time [ there 's inevitably a collapse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_internal_contradictions_of_capital_accumulation ) * blaming external forces rather than looking at the true cause ( the capitalist mode of production ) . 
  listen , i 'm sorry for having such a dismissive tone , it 's a trying few days for us all , waking up to discover that half of voters in one of the most powerful nations on earth are somehow not absolutely disgusted by trump 's words or actions . 
  did i say hitler ? 
  no , i said fascism . 
  front national have always flirted with fascism , and with europe goose-stepping to the right i would n't be surprised if they were making out with it before too long . 
  how the mass media constantly encourages us to blame our ills on external forces rather than internal has so much more influenced the discourse within the political sphere than calling a racist a racist or calling a spade a spade . 
  but `` you hurt our fee-fees by calling us racist rather than listening to our racist diatribe ! '', 
  fits the narrative that is pushed so much on reddit recently that that 's going to be the dominant opinion for too damn long . 
  if you can not convince a fascist , acquaint his head with the pavement . 
  ** - trotsky ** if fascism could be defeated in debate , i assure you that it would never have happened , neither in germany , nor in italy , nor anywhere else . 
  those who recognised its threat at the time and tried to stop it were , i assume , also called `` a mob '' . 
  regrettably too many `` fair-minded '' people did n't either try , or want to stop it , and , as i witnessed myself during the war , accommodated themselves when it took over ... people who witnessed fascism at its height are dying out , but the ideology is still here , and its apologists are working hard at a comeback . 
  past experience should teach us that fascism must be stopped before it takes hold again of too many minds , and becomes useful once again to some powerful interests . 
  ** - franz frison , holocaust survivor ** fascism is a repugnant ideology , dressed up in pretty words - everybody wants to believe that they are the chosen people , that their country and culture is superior to all other . 
  that they need a strong military to defend what is theres , and take what they deserve . 
  but for every ubermensch is an untermensch , for every chosen country and culture is an counterculture that must be repressed for the sake of ` unity ' . 
  for every lebensraum a generalplan ost . 
  the anti-fa have the right idea , no breathing space for nazis , no breathing space for fascism . 
  never again . 
  the real monsters were the friends we made along the way . 
  loving the orbitting moons , i 'm happy to just watch them sod the gold . 
   finally the social strike !, 
  --  the transnational social strike platform invites workers , activists , unionists and european networks to meet again in paris from the 21st to the 23rd of october to discuss how the social strike in france can pave the way to a transnational uprising -- when you say `` finally , this thing is going to happen '' , i 'd rather not get to the bottom of the article to read you meant `` in a couple of months we want to get together to work out how and when to do this thing '' . 
  see : mutualism, 
  we 're talking about mostly kids wandering around playing a game and getting caught in the detritus of a war over a decade old . 
  that was my thinking, 
  what about spudingo ? 
  communism is more than marxism though , and marxism is more than m-lism . 
  it 's like describing capitalism wholly by neoliberalism . 
  or red wholly by #ff 0000, 
  well technically by omission it was legalised in russia in 1917, 
  if you 'd like a further discussion on the nature of communism then ) / r/communism101 is a better resource - my draw to communism is wholly emotive and not well researched . 
  i think you might be confusing marxist-leninism and communism, 
  i know it 's pretty good for definitions . 
  i 'm sure if you wo n't accept that then you wo n't accept the sidebar of / r/communism101 [ which is a great resource if you 'd like to actually learn more ] and therein the `` dictionary of revolutionary marxism '' , but i did n't have as much literature on my computer as i thought i did . 
  [ socialism ] ( http://www.massline.org/dictionary/so.htm ) : an intermediate and transitional form of society between capitalism and communism , characterized in its economic aspect by the principle `` from each according to his ability , to each according to his work , '' and characterized in its political aspect by the genuine ** control and rule of society by the revolutionary proletariat ** and its party or parties . 
  [ communism ] ( http://www.massline.org/dictionary/com.htm ) : a social ideal and theory of society in which there are no social classes . 
  [ i note that the moneyless and stateless is missing from this definition ] from the [ communist manifesto ] ( https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ ) itself : `` in one word , you reproach us with intending to do away with your property . 
  precisely so ; that is just what we intend . 
  from the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital '' not quite said as straight as i remembered , but it 's in there - i do n't think anyone could argue that the communist manifesto is n't accurate about the nature of communism . 
  is `` literally the first line of the wikipedia articles backs up what i say '' enough , or shall i find you direct quotes from elsewhere ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism `` socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by ** social ownership and democratic control of the means of production ** , as well as the political ideologies , theories , and movements that aim at their establishment . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism `` in political and social sciences , communism ( from latin communis , ` common , universal ' ) is a social , political , and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society , which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and ** the absence of social classes , money , and the state . 
  socialism is worker control over the means of production . 
  anyone who has ever read anything on socialism knows that . 
  people will refuse to accept that certain states are communist , because communism is a * classless , moneyless , stateless society * , again from literally any writing on communism . 
  but clearly you have your ideological goggles on . 
  it 's two terms that mean totally different things though , that 's like trying to remove confusion by using red to mean blue . 
  social democracy *, 
  songs of europe : [ bela lugosi 's dead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okrjfipijgy ) by [ bauhaus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bauhaus_ ( band \\ ) ) ( distinct from [ bauhaus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bauhaus ) ), 
  why hello mr pot . 
  please do n't remind me, 
  the ussr is not what i would call communism .
