  and before anyone says `` no true scotsman '' , there was n't communal ownership , there was n't even worker control after the soviets got disbanded , and the government is not the people . 
  but also the material conditions that the ussr lived under ( going from feudalism to superpower to cold war to economic collapse and the huge economic crash afterwards ) would make it hard for me to say it imploded too . 
  and again , paris , catalonia , ukraine , inevitably rojava . 
  one example vs. four . 
  did you read it ? 
  and where communism has been realised ( paris , catalonia , ukraine , possibly rojava ) , it 's been crushed by external forces , not by people within being assholes . 
  and inevitably when in the future the same graph has some socialism on it ? 
  let 's try tracking that back a bit further , see if we could use the same graphs to show that feudalism is working . 
  i try to write as i talk , so sometimes there 'll be y' alls and fuckin 's and sometimes there 'll be * talking in italics * and ** talking just a little bit louder ** . 
  and if i need to , #talking a lot louder but only ever to get heard over the crowd . 
  and you 're welcome to look at the sources for the figures for their validity , i 'm letting them talk for themselves , i just wanted to revisit the point that * i 'm just taking the 100 million at face value initially * . 
  well , let 's take it back a little then . 
  according to the un , it would take [ $ 30b ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html ) to solve world hunger . 
  according to forbes , bill gates has [ $ 86b ] ( https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#34d902a251c7 ) . 
  i do n't see any other conclusion than `` private control of capital is killing people '' . 
  egoist anarchism heck yeah, 
  hey , let 's look at the study to see if your assumption that it was the collapse of the ussr ( which i again reiterate that i do n't support ) is a factor . 
  [ oh look ] ( http://puu.sh/vghiq/101bf5c88c.png ) , if anything the rate was falling * faster before 1990 * . 
  [ and another link to piotr kropotkin 's `` are we good enough '' ] ( https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-are-we-good-enough ) , because we 've been fighting this propaganda for ~ 200 years . 
  hahahahah [ crony capitalism ] ( http://graphics.occupydesign.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13220925_10209672502151778_5572313542892881295_n.jpg ) , do everything you can to avoid saying the word . 
  the sources for the figures are right there . 
  unless you 're going to claim that the un , oxfam and the children 's hospital of philadelphia are deep-state antifa conspiracies ( which i would n't be surprised by ) . 
  whether or not capitalism is working to bring people out of poverty , it is n't working fast enough . 
  it is n't the best system to accomplish that goal . 
  we keep redefining how poverty is defined to keep the numbers looking good , we keep defining poverty in such a way that a sustainable lifestyle is poverty so long as there 's no money attached to it , so that everyone is implicitely in support of capitalism . 
  on the point of gulags , and bearing in mind that * i do n't support the soviet union , never have , never will , same with all anarchists * , the us prison system today is the largest in the world . 
  it 's a prison industrial complex , it 's legalised slavery ( it 's even in the constitution that prisoners can be slaves ! ) . 
  and what 's more , it 's combined with a racist judicial system . 
  i 've seen countless videos of young men shot dead in the streets by the police forces that were alledgedly there to protect them . 
  i agree ( even though i am very much not a fan of the soviets ) , i was just taking the number at face value because ** the reality of capitalism is disgusting even compared to the worst propaganda ** . 
  are you saying that capitalism is working ? 
  the bboc says that 100 million people have been killed by ` communism ' since 1917 . 
  do you know how old you 'd have to be for 22,000 children dying * every day * to have already been more than that ? 
  12.5 years old . 
  [ unicef ] ( https://www.unicef.org/media/media_56045.html ) . 
  and that 's children under 5 . 
  every day . 
  [ counterpoint to your `` humans are assholes '' point ] ( https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-are-we-good-enough ) by piotr kropotkin , anarchist philosopher . 
  he claims that because humans are assholes , anarchistic communism is the * only * system that would work . 
  fun fact , that 100 million number comes from the black book of communism . 
  for a moment , i 'm going to ignore any and all biases that might be included in such a creatively named book , and take that number at its face value . 
  thanks to lack of suitable resources , and the fact that * it is not profitable to save them * , capitalism kills [ 20 million people every year ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4clgapv.jpg ) . 
  22,000 children die from lack of adequate resources * every day * . 
  capitalism is not `` trading things '' . 
  capitalism is not `` having nice things '' . 
  capitalism is : private ownership of the means of production ( theft of the whole world ) , wage labour ( slavery for those who have nothing to sell but their own lives ) , profit seeking ( accumulation of wealth into dynasties that will never relinquish it ) . 
  communism is communal ownership of all . 
  yeah , should be scotland blue , ireland green , england red and wales yellow ( daffodils ), 
  without opening the gigantic kettle of fish that is irish nationalism , socialists have been in favour of national liberation movements ( eg . 
  independence movements within the british empire , ireland included ) but against nationalist movements within countries that are not under the rule of foreign invaders . 
  they 'd sell the whole world to make a profit . 
  rho , rho , fight the \u03c0ower !, 
  memes are real ? 
  you 're right , it 's not like that at all . 
  i definitely appreciate that it is a complicated situation . 
  your day will come, 
  ^ ( although if you do want to make a 32 county socialist republic i 'm down for that too ), 
  eh on the one hand i say `` say no to all nationalism '' , but on the other hand ... there 's been several hundred years of colonialist brutality towards the irish and irish traditions . 
  i 'm not going to tell them how to try to reclaim some sense of identity . 
  well this is an entirely necessary and not obnoxious bot . 
  more like [ lulworth cove ] ( http://www.supexplorer.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lulworth_cove_sunset.jpg ) imo . 
  presumably , it formed in the same way as [ lulworth cove ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lulworth_cove ), 
  wal es , are you sure ? 
  or cym ru , again not so sure, 
  fight me, 
  calm down mate , assume good intent - i was just pointing out that it was - , sorry if you thought my tone was aggressive . 
  - am i blind or are those two things not the same ? 
  i deleted my original one to try and quit reddit . 
  it did n't work . 
  if only there was some international standard , like [ 2016-12-13 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_8601 ), 
  #or cider !, 
  `` soviet times '' is too large a period of time and array of countries to make such sweeping generalisations . 
  homosexuality was decriminalised in lenin 's russia but illegal again later for example, 
  interesting how cornwall and wales stand out pretty well . 
  i describe fascist ideology ( which i am violently opposed to ) as follows :  an ideology that infantilises women and the workers , believing that a strong , paternal state is necessary to protect them from themselves . 
  belief that their people and nation are superior to all others and that they need a strong military to defend ourselves and take what is theirs from foreign influences who would weaken them . 
  jingoistic tendencies within the media and society . 
  belief in a singular , strong culture , with a clearly defined hierarchy , and that any forces that would dilute that culture should be repressed . 
  belief in racial purity and the need to prevent ` muddying the waters ' , by genocide if necessary . 
  ( if the pronouns in there change up it 's because i changed it from talking in the place of a fascist to talking about fascism . 
  the sun definitely believes # 2 ( see : just about every article mentioning the military , funding thereof and their reaction to the sinking of the belgrano , their approach to the eu ) , # 3 ( see their approach to any alternative cultures , subcultures , immigrations `` gay judge '' etc. ) . 
  not so much # 1 , # 4 ( or at least not publically ) . 
  calling the sun nowadays fascistic is indeed spreading the paint too far , but they have some fascistic views and approaches . 
  about 0 % accurate my friend , but i 'll keep in mind that there 're people who 'll take offence if i try to share interesting tidbits of information . 
   the term `` first world war '' was first used in september 1914 by the german biologist and philosopher ernst haeckel , who claimed that `` there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared ` european war ' ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word , '' citing a wire service report in the indianapolis star on 20 september 1914 . 
  after the onset of the second world war in 1939 , the terms world war i or the first world war became standard , with british and canadian historians favouring the first world war , and americans world war i. 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i#names ), 
  why ca n't the workers do that organising ? 
  why do they need someone to organise for them ? 
  why ca n't the organiser take an even share , rather than an excessive amount ? 
  socialists do n't care about taxes , they care about who 's in control of the workplace : the owner ( who might never even visit but to extract their pay ) , or the workers . 
  socialists and the workers recognise the need to work , as they ( the workers ) have nothing to sell aside from their ability to work , while their bosses * sell what the workers have produced * then ** give them back less value than they made ** . 
  a spectre is haunting europe -- the spectre of communism . 
  roughly when india became part of britain . 
  first i 've heard of it . 
  `` i 'll have an irish carbomb a la akbar '' - some american bar somewhere probably circa 2030 . 
  `` remember i said i 'd kill you last ? 
  i lied '', 
  falg space communism, 
  in the end it likely came down to `` anyone but le pen '' .
