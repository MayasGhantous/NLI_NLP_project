everything works out to be cheaper by about a quarter to a fifth ( equivalent pricing in euros here to what you 'd pay in pounds back in the uk ) , so that seems about right . 
  you 're glad he asked , but still give no answer . 
  which is a little odd . 
  living in the netherlands , i do mentally convert prices here to their # equivalent , though . 
  it 's a holdover from wwii rationing , i believe . 
  we just never went back or reintroduced the tradition of making good coffee . 
  instant was just too convenient . 
  ah , my mistake . 
  i even read the article , but in both cases my eyes skimmed over the non - clause . 
  `` global warming to blame for ongoing pension crisis ! '', 
  multi-class to wizard when you get the opportunity . 
  i expect a lot of students would just lean on their [ european health insurance card ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_health_insurance_card ) and fudge how long they 're staying in the country when they visit the doctor , at least for most health issues . 
  according to ukip , the immigrants are somehow managing to take all british jobs while simultaneously all being lazy good-for-nothing benefit scroungers and layabouts . 
  it 's actually quite impressive . 
  calling back the french that i learned in school a decade and a half ago when i was 14 : `` je voudrais acheter un pain '' ... wait , conjugation ... `` je veux acheter un pain '' ... now `` un '' sounds wrong . 
  who buys `` a bread '' ? 
  is `` pain '' even masculine ? 
  au pain ? 
  du pain ? 
  de la pain sounds even worse , so maybe it is masculine . 
  fuck it , they 'll get the gist of it if i point my stubby fingers at the basket of rolls . 
  westminster could use the occasional reminder about that point , too . 
  / r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu is the official homepage . 
   also , conceptually , i am not sure why people are so against foodbanks giving people food . 
  in what was is this worse than the state giving people money to buy food ( which is presumably their alternative ) . 
  in my mind the process for ensuring that people with need get fed is not really so important as the outcome . 
  i think it 's mostly that the term `` food bank '' brings up mental images of the bread lines from impoverished second world countries , which causes some cognitive dissonance amongst those who see britain as being a thoroughly first world nation . 
  yes , i do . 
  if delivering rightful verdicts is `` a waste of time '' for courts , then why do courts exist ? 
  habeus corpus is a central plank in common law , and capital punishment has been abolished in the first world ( with one glaring exception ) for good reason . 
  effectively sentencing people to death in absentia , without a trial , is not something i want to set precedents for . 
  it 's a default sub for accounts created by a europe-based ip address ( with some exceptions ) , but not for the wider world . 
  urban living space , but that 's mostly down to zoning issues - still plenty of room to expand if it became an * actual * problem as opposed to political fodder . 
  i gave up on / r/ukpolitics just a week or two ago . 
  the final straw was being shouted down for pointing out that people complaining how immigrants are simultaneously `` stealing jobs '' while also deriding them all as being `` lazy benefit thieves '' are practising doublethink of the highest order . 
  to quote randall munroe : `` defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession ; you 're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it 's not literally illegal to express '' . 
  ukip are not going to win a majority of the votes . 
  it 's just not going to happen . 
  instead , they 'll split the right wing votes away from the conservatives , leaving labour to form the next government , either as the majority party or in coalition with the libdems . 
  it 's kind of weird considering that , historically-speaking , labour has been the anti-eu party . 
  but they 're the safest bet for remaining a part of continental politics for the time being . 
   the uk will pay or finally leave the eu and quit bitching . 
  it 's unbearable . 
  while this particular issue clearly has the uk in the wrong if they do n't pay , dissent is not supposed to be a problem in a democracy . 
  so what would it take for you to consider it a `` real '' issue , as opposed to one fluffed up for political purposes ? 
  and the word cretin means christian and villains are all from villages . 
  language evolves and , in common parlance , anti-semitic is synonymous with anti-jewish . 
  do reindeer migrations count ? 
  if so , then it 's a major tourist hub . 
  i kind of agree with the bayer father , let 's go with him . 
  10-euro beers are not uncommon in even standard oslo pubs . 
  nights out get very expensive very quickly . 
  no , see , youre using an outdated definition of shill . 
  what it * really * means is `` person i disagree with , and is therefore wrong '' . 
  i imagine it being spoken like james bond 's self-introduction whenever it comes up in a sentence . 
  `` and coming up in fifteen kilometers is the city of ... derry , london derry . '', 
   lopez said his life has `` turned around 360 degrees in terms of opportunities and professional growth . '' that 's not a particularly encouraging a statement to make !, 
  i hate to admit it , but i 'm mostly familiar with the albanian flag because of the europa universalis strategy games , where they 're inevitably annexed within six months of the game 's start by the ottomans . 
  who said i was criticising you ? 
  you asked to be corrected if you were wrong , so i brought it up . 
  even putting aside the native americans nations ( and there * were * several centralised nations ) , there 's still the huge swathe of land taken by force from the mexicans during the mexican-american war , the whole `` 54 '40 or fight '' ra-ra going on with canada , and other territorial disputes . 
  cuba was seen as an almost inevitable conquest for much of the 19th century that just kept getting put off until it was no longer politically viable . 
  was it `` evil '' or `` wrong '' ? 
  by the standards of the time , not really . 
  but to pretend that the expansion of the u.s. across the north american continent was carried out without extensive use and/or threat of military force is just wrongheaded . 
  that 's a lot of chins . 
  you might want to cut down a little on the bacon . 
   pretty sure usa has n't attempted to take over and annex a continent with their military . 
  well , except their own . 
  that ended a while ago , though . 
  good photo ops . 
  it wasnt a rhetorical question - i was hoping for an answer . 
  wonder why austria chose not to forward their figures . 
  for any unfamiliar with economics acronyms : * gdp ( not gpd ) : ** gross domestic product ** - basically the sum total of economic value produced by a nation per year * ppp : ** purchasing power parity ** - an adjustment compensating for different currencies , to make sure that all the figures make sense with one another when put on the same chart like this . 
  * ** per capita ** : take the national figures and divide it by the population , to compare the figures per citizen in each country * imf : ** international monetary fund ** - an international trade organisation . 
  they 're the people who compiled the information * ** 2015 ** - that 's next year . 
  * ** estimate ** - now you 're just being silly . 
  tl ; dr : an educated guess at how much economic value the average ( median ) individual in a country is likely to produce next year . 
  because the last [ `` children 's crusade '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/children's_crusade ) from germany went just swimmingly . 
  there have been wishes and ideas about a united europe since the fall of rome . 
  it 's most of the reason why charlemagne was so quickly endorsed by the papacy . 
  at some point you just have to stick a cut-off point in if you want to fit everything into a one-hour documentary . 
  world war ii is as good a place as any . 
  the * romance of the three kingdoms * said it best :  `` the empire , long divided , must unite ; long united , must divide '', 
   porridge costs # 2 a box for fucks sake and will give you breakfast for near 2 months . 
  where are you buying 5kg boxes of oats for # 2 ? 
  i do get your point though . 
  the sun still [ never sets on the british empire ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/48/ ) . 
  assuming they bother with a referendum on the matter . 
  which is his prerogative . 
  independence is a central plank of his party 's platform , its what an awful lot of his constituents want ( as the referendum shows ) . 
  then you just need to import some moai statues to glare across the border . 
  the dutch have some of the best greek and turkish food around . 
   king of spain becomes only king of castille so navarre/basque country gets federal recognition as a separate entity too in this scenario ? 
  well , greenland 's semi-sort-of-independence has gone pretty smoothly so far . 
  mostly because i think most danes sort of forgot that it existed in the first place . 
  perhaps a singular authority should be formed to govern over them . 
  some sort of ... caliphate . 
  the border between ireland and the united kingdom already opens up some weirdness . 
  if you ca n't get into the uk legally for one reason or another , but can still get to ireland , you can cross the border into ni without showing any id , then take the ferry across to mainland britain again without any id , and you 've just circumvented your ban in a fairly unpreventable manner .
