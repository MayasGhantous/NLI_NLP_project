  scotland is just going to make things weirder if axehomeless ' scenario takes place . 
  yep . 
  she 's consulted regularly by the pm on matters of state . 
  which makes sense - she 's ( with one exception ) the longest-reigning head of state currently alive ( and by the end of the year will be in the top 50 across all recorded history ) , has met more foreign dignitaries and is more widely-travelled than any head of state * ever * , and has advised every prime minister since churchill . 
  it 's always worth hearing her opinion even if you decide to do the exact opposite . 
  ignore the whole royalty thing - experience of that kind of quality and quantity is a national treasure . 
  i have absolutely no idea how border control would work in that case . 
  i agree , personally . 
  strong local government over a manageable territory for domestic issues and a loose federal eu government for foreign policy and dispute resolution between the regions . 
  the current setup is more than a little skewed towards a handful of `` superpowers '' . 
  i 'm not arguing whether independence would be good or bad , just pointing out that that particular argument `` they 're afraid !, 
  that means its a good idea ! '', 
  is a pretty bad one regardless of which side one takes . 
  bookies ' odds are at [ 2:1 yes against 4:11 no ] ( http://www.oddschecker.com/politics/british-politics/scottish-independence/referendum-outcome ) , which is as good a way as gauging it as any ( if you reckon they 've got it wrong , feel free to put some money down ! ), 
  the scots stand to gain economic and political independence from westminster , regaining the money from north sea gas/oil , with most of the prospective leadership pledging to reinvest that into education , healthcare and infrastructure . 
  to what degree they keep those promises once they 're actually in the driving seat depends on how credulous you are about politicians in general . 
  despite claims to the contrary , scotland does have a relatively diversified economy , so they 're not going to be stuck up a creek once the hydrocarbon reserves run dry . 
  it 's probably a bit late to set up a massive norway-style trust fund , particularly given how loud the calls are to use the money now !, 
  more importantly , they 're freer to exercise their self-determination to set up their government the way they want it . 
  currently , uk policy both foreign and domestic leans a lot further to the right than the average scot is comfortable with . 
  the new equilibrium , whenever it settles , is likely to be farther to the left . 
  ignoring the ultranationalist hype ( strong as evar !, 
  ) , they will more or less lose relevancy as a world power , though they 'll still be a strong regional power . 
  this is not necessarily a bad thing . 
  there are still a lot of cards left unplayed - the question of the division of the uks debt , the status of the currency union , eu accession , all have `` rough '' outlines , but nothing 's set in stone yet . 
  _________________ in short , they 'll be * fine * . 
  stronger in some respects , weaker in others . 
  happier in the short term , probably roughly the same in the long run once they 've got their own political class to complain about ( same as any other country in the world ) . 
  it is only the most recent polls that have shown any real possibility of it happening at all . 
  even now , the edge is rather slim . 
  the only issue i have at all with the vote is that no matter which way it goes , 40 + % of the region is going to be unhappy . 
  that , and the scots leaving means that any future referendum for the uk to leave the eu is even more likely to succeed : /, 
  do n't worry , the italians will do something silly before the weeks end and we 'll all be back to poking them instead . 
  i agree that he seems like a good sort . 
  i do n't think that he will be worth consulting on political matters for a decade or two , though . 
  still , it must start some time if he is ever to build up the same sort of body of experience as liz . 
  and again , i do n't see why that 's a compelling argument . 
  one side has plenty to lose if the u.s. decides to nuke guatemala . 
  does n't make it a good idea . 
   these headlines are oozing with fear . 
  makes me even more confident that independence is going to be the right choice for the scots . 
  that sounds like a pretty causal argument to me . 
  headlines show fear . 
  you take that as evidence for the benefits of independence . 
  that seems an odd criterion to get your support . 
  headlines ooze with fear over what putin 's up to in ukraine too , for example . 
  here 's hoping they do , if only to include the welsh . 
  thing is , i 've got no problem with the queen in an advisory position . 
  she 's got more experience with the problems faced by governments than any person alive , and a unique perspective that only comes from being an `` insider on the outside '' . 
  charles , on the other hand , is a bit of a soggy biscuit and is probably best left out of the loop . 
  are you sure it 's not [ john noble ] ( http://uk.eonline.com/eol_images/entire_site/20080916/300.noble.fringe.lc.091608.jpg ) in drag ? 
  russians have been alternating bald and full-haired presidents for [ nearly two centuries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bald%e2%80%93hairy ) . 
  the next president should have a forehead that will more easily fit into current russian territory . 
  on the other hand , if it came down to a referendum for the uk leaving the eu , would n't you rather have the scottish votes bolstering the pro-eu numbers ? 
  also , busy in africa . 
  operation serval finished winding down only a few months ago and they just launched [ operation barkhane ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barkhane ) in july . 
  plus the longstanding operations like the libyan containment that have been running since the 80s . 
  sadly we lost too much prestige for a stable personal union . 
  it 's a danish region unfairly occupied by swedes . 
  and in all honesty , the welsh too . 
  the push for true independence in wales died in the 80s . 
  though my dad has a few amusing stories about his run-ins with the more violent extremists while at university . 
  the ulster unionists are more pro-british than the english themselves . 
  i really , * really * do n't see this happening . 
  isis ' [ original plans ] ( https://i.imgur.com/thdgjyz.jpg ) were n't far off . 
  as an aside , the map that the group used to put together that image is from the paradox grand strategy game victoria ii , which got some laughs over on / r/paradoxplaza . 
  in many common law jurisdictions you can waive your right to a jury trial . 
  and if your defence is based on facts rather than emotional appeal , it can be a good idea . 
  still nice to have the option , though . 
  train or car , i would say . 
  i do n't know . 
  since he seems to be painting in the water , a little dash here and there and finland will never have to worry about russia crossing the border again . 
  where did i tell anyone to stop `` complaining '' ? 
  all i brought up was that using body-count as the sole way of `` ranking '' disasters as worthy of changing the banner , as you did , is not the best way to go about it . 
  turning this into a dick-measuring contest on whose disaster killed more people isnt good for anyone . 
  and hes definitely got [ stage presence ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ioe3kff.gif ) . 
  how the h \\* ll has australia gotten such a low usage of the word `` c * nt '' ? 
  its practically the standard greeting there . 
  in some ways , but not in others . 
  germany is a manufacturing giant , and has disproportionately benefitted from the eurozone because it artificially depresses the price of its goods , allowing it to maintain a positive balance of trade that keeps the cash flowing in and the goods flowing out . 
  the uks manufacturing industry , on the other hand , is not one of the country 's strong suits outside of a few very specialised areas , and so ca n't expect to see a commensurate benefit from adopting the euro . 
  you can make a case for exceptionalism for pretty much every country in the world - the nature of nation-states is that every single one is a unique case study . 
  and our current situation works out better than either . 
  seems to be working out fairly well so far , though . 
  germany ? 
  other countries ? 
  to some degree , yeah . 
  always good to know that there 's no room for dissent in a democracy . 
  i expect that there are plenty of people willingly but * unhappily * selling themselves , same as with any other job . 
  i would say that having a strong eurosceptic member of the union is one of the key planks in preventing `` federal abomination '' . 
  if the uk leaves , who is going to form the opposition to such a venture ? 
  you 're the one who brought up the pound , despite it being utterly irrelevant . 
  do you notice that my flair says british * expat * , idiot ? 
  i have n't seen a 1 or 2 cent piece for quite a while . 
  everywhere around here just rounds to the nearest 0,05 . 
  ca n't say that i 've really missed them , either . 
  there are a whole host of issues that are more or less specific to the british . 
  rather than go into detail on them myself , i 'll quote an older post by / u/wobblewagon on the subject : ____ where do you want to start ? 
  i could mention the waste , the currency issue which is dragging southern eu economies down and which invariably is dragging the bailing out countries down . 
  the inherent assault on competition within the eu 's own single market .
