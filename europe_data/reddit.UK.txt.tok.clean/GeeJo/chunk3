  the ecb , or even go on the attack of individual politicians , how they are appointed/elected and why it favours mediocrity . 
  i 'll address specific policy issues by cobbling together some of my own old posts and adding to them . 
  ** agriculture : ** european economies are not the same . 
  when half the eu budget goes towards cap , and yet when the uk has some of the largest , most efficient farms , but obviously fewer of them in total number , the cap does n't represent uk farms for the better , but allows continental farms to close the gap . 
  the scottish forced information using the freedom of information act . 
  they found that corporations like nestle and tate & lyle had received billions over the last decade , whilst the average scottish farmer had only received # 9,000 per annum . 
  why are we subsidising huge corporations that already turn massive profits ? 
  from the uk perspective the uk wants to be able to take nothing from cap and , if subsidies are necessary , to be able to tailor them for their own needs , to the most deserving , out of their * own * pocket .

  that also means we have a massive amount of coastline for our size and we have a large sea on one side and a large ocean on the other . 
  when the spanish joined the cfp the size of the european shipping fleet doubled in size . 
  for 30 years since the uk , and conservationists , have argued constantly for meaningful reform . 
  every year 800,000 tonnes of fish are dumped back into british waters ( british under international maritime law ) , dead , because of policy which has turned out to be impossible to reform . 
  completely counter productive to economy and conservation . 
  being an island this hits the uk disproportionately hard . 
  dropping out of the cfp would provide the uk with an extra # 2.5 bn a year before counting the extra costs of bureaucracy attached to managing the cfp ; preserving a dying industry , removing some of the most harmful practices in uk waters , stopping over fishing through the numbers of ships , and providing a huge boon to conservation . 
  that 's not to say that the cfp could n't continue on its own without the uk , but after 30 years , and a decade review last year which delivered nothing meaningful , the uk is being hardest hit , and continues to be so .

  the uk economy is unique to europe . 
  just as the economy differs greatly between north and south europe , the uk in turn differs from the north with far more emphasis on finance and services . 
  this means that when an eu trade commissioner goes on an overseas delegation on behalf of the whole eu , the uk 's needs are not indicative . 
  when the eu sent a delegation to india , india specifically had one thing on its bucket list : financial services . 
  the uk had one thing on its bucket list : financial services . 
  the indians and uk were frustrated and manacled to negotiating around textiles and farming * for months * . 
  are we expected to believe an eu commissioner best represents uk financial services when the uk , along with the czech republic , were the only two states which refused the eu fiscal compact ? 
  the uk does n't * need * to be part of a large trading bloc , although it can still be part of that bloc and expect those trading through it with europe to meet all the eu requirements , because of what its products are . 
  we do n't need to intimidate china to get a great deal any more than germany needs to intimidate south america to get them to drive german cars . 
  they want high end machinery designed to make cheap low end products - they come to the uk . 
  if they want to extenuate a global footprint in finance , it 's london . 
  they want high end innovation , financial services and banking , top grade pharmaceuticals and chemicals . 
  we do n't need the eu to help sell these . 
  we also should n't need the eu to trade with countries whom we share a head of state with !, 
  it 's not an argument of empire . 
  the commonwealth is built on recognising full sovereignty of others . 
  it 's just that through a fluke of history we find ourselves with a shared language , culture and history outside the eu , as well as having links to the eu , and going through the eu does n't help the uk in these matters e.g. 
  switzerland should not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement with canada faster than the uk .

  in 1975 edward heath said , `` fears that we shall in some way lose sovereignty or independence are , i need hardly say , completely unjustified . '', 
  that is how the uk voted . 
  they never wanted political unity or judicial courts . 
  for almost 40 years now it 's small wonder that the uk has grown increasingly concerned . 
  they 've even been arguing for this debate since 1992 and maastricht . 
  every time they secure opt outs and vetoes , legally ** and which others agree to ** , and then are harassed when they choose to exercise them . 
  ** the european court of justice : ** the ecj told employers that if their employee gets sick on paid vacation time it was not the private insurance or travel policy but the employer 's job to compensate them . 
  paid vacation is one thing . 
  paid vacation and then paying them again if they had a bad experience when on holiday : it 's madness . 
  it 's widely open to corruption and being taken advantage of . 
  a company has to work around to make sure they can provide them the relevant time off , pay them paid holiday leave , and rightly so , even sick leave , but then be hit for another bill or extra time off because they were sick when they were n't supposed to be in work , and now they want a second holiday ?!, 
  it 's economic disaster in the making , especially for the little guy . 
  the ecj driving a stake into small and medium sized businesses and employment figures . 
  a ruling made by a judge with no knowledge of existing uk sovereign law . 
  they even recently ruled that airlines had to cover expenses of people delayed even when through no fault of the airline , and that uk insurance companies could n't evaluate risk and set policies around gender . 
  the ecj ruling increased some young women driver 's insurance costs by up to 25 % overnight . 
  the ecj should not be involving itself in private pension risk assessment ; especially when it 's ( a ) punishing the consumer , and ( b ) negatively affecting those that should be the statistically cheaper to insure .

  i do n't know , one guy [ managed to conquer it pretty much on a whim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b8rgen_j%c3%b8rgensen ) . 
  boris johnson for prime minister !, 
  sitting down for a riveting session of tractor simulator 2013 . 
  and there could well be some overlap . 
  i suspect a few just want bulgaria tojoin * any * union rather than going alone . 
  * burger = tasty * burgher = not tasty, 
  in english-speaking countries , they 're really not . 
  there are several factors that account for the difference : firstly , in the u.s. , the government has only those powers that are * specifically * granted to them , with everything else remaining in the hands of the citizens . 
  in the uk , the government holds to itself all rights * except * in areas where it is restricted by law . 
  thankfully we have enough laws restricting the government , built up over centuries , that the end result is more or less the same . 
  but the attitude that the different approaches represent carries through to daily life . 
  ____ secondly , the u.s. attitude favours the rights of the individual , while european attitudes favour the rights of the collective . 
  if you 're doing something that is blatantly against the interests of your neighbours , to the point that anyone with an iota of common sense would realise it , the collective wins out regardless of whether or not it offends the individual . 
  the usual ( though controversial ) example is the idea of `` hate speech '' . 
  neither approach is strictly better than the other , they just demonstrate different values . 
  the thing is that the uk is unique in europe in that it already has a large collection of developed countries outside of the region with which it shares closer cultural , linguistic , economic and historical ties than it does to its immediate neighbours : the commonwealth . 
  the french also maintain close ties to many of its former colonies , but the relationship is n't really `` equal '' - france towers above places like algeria or mali , and the cultural exchange is largely one-way . 
  the uk , on the other hand , regards canada , australia , new zealand and india ( and the u.s. , if you expand out to a general anglosphere ) as equal partners . 
  so it feels less of a need to forge a `` european '' identity . 
  the uk elects its politicians to get the maximum benefits out of eu membership while fighting against measures that would hurt our interests . 
  we 're not going to vote for wishy-washy `` but this benefits * everyone else * '' policies . 
  that 's the job of the politicians representing * those * interests . 
  is n't that the entire point of a representative democracy ? 
  honestly you encounter more `` overly patriotic '' americans as tourists than you do in-country . 
  mr bean is much more internationally-friendly , since it does n't rely on dialogue . 
  blackadder , on the other hand , is filled with puns and wordplay that are very difficult to translate out of english . 
  * slightly * more conservative might be underselling it a bit . 
  your centre-left party would qualify as far-right in most of western europe on many issues . 
  with their leadership , `` batshit '' is a useful descriptive term at times . 
  do you see many talking squirrels in your neighbourhood ? 
  historically and culturally georgia has been a part of the european sphere for a long , long time . 
  turkey straddles the border , but as the successor state to the ottomans it essentially had its own sphere of influence separate from europe , one that extended through most of the middle east and part of northern africa . 
  that said , the biggest barrier to turkey joining the eu is its own laws and governmental practices . 
  in the very very short term ( weeks ) there would be a sudden shock . 
  then the finns would start buying their oil from norway at only a slightly higher rate . 
  it would * damage * the economy , but it would n't cause a collapse . 
  russia is the cheapest option at the moment , so that 's where countries buy from . 
  that does n't make them the * only * option . 
  though there 's always a significant lead time involved in expanding nuclear facilities . 
  it 's not something you can do as a reaction to an unexpected political crisis . 
  kind of annoying that people are downvoting you without even bothering to give a rebuttal . 
  downvotes are not supposed to be a `` disagree '' button , and the point of this subreddit is to be a forum for * discussion * about europe . 
  this includes welcoming `` anti-europe '' viewpoints , provided they 're not out-and-out bigotry/xenophobia . 
  otherwise the whole thing just turns into an echo chamber of self-congratulation . 
  i 'd think that this comment would be a perfect jumping off point for a discussion on protectionism as it applies to us-eu trade relations .
