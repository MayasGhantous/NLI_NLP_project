  [ salami tactics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe&amp;t=24 ) . 
  the one i just ca n't forget even a decade on is [ julie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nbcno_l8y ) . 
  i 'm not even sure why , but it 's always stuck out to me even among the other grisly driving safety ads . 
  in the end , having to raise money for his treatments was a smokescreen . 
  even at the start it was n't the issue - he was initially not going to go for treatment , then was more concerned about leaving enough behind * after * he was gone that his ( unemployed ) wife , son , and baby daughter would be fine without him . 
  it did n't take long for it to be more about his ego than the money itself ( e.g. 
  his turning down of his former friends ' offer to pay for his treatment ) . 
  you hear that , boys ? 
  even the eu knows it ca n't win against us !, 
  time to march on brussels !, 
  personally i prefer belgian , their conching method seems to work better for my tastes . 
  not so much in the netherlands . 
  here , if you only speak english , you 're competing against a crowd who all speak english * and * dutch . 
  `` no , but [ i 'll take four candles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu9mptwycb8 ) if you 've got them . '', 
  there 's no good reason to block the application if the independence vote has already gone through . 
  all it would do is massively damage relations for no gain at all . 
  scotland already meets every criterion for accession and its joining is n't going to cause a flood of immigrants across the border ; ~ ~ the only real problem is that it makes the uks refusal to join the schengen area even more loopholey than the `` irish backdoor '' already makes it . ~ ~ * *** edit : *** bleh , stupid error about ireland . 
  ignore . 
  it seems that what truly brings europe together is [ schlong !, 
  ] ( http://ukdataexplorer.com/european-translator/?word=schlong ) . 
  * [ trollhunter ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) , a `` found footage '' - style monster flick , with a documentary film crew stumbling across one of the last government-sponsored troll-hunters in rural norway . 
  sort of like cloverfield , only without quite as much nausea-inducing shaky-cam ( still a little , but not as much ) . 
  * [ the extraordinary adventures of adele blanc-sec ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179025/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) is something of a french version of lemony snicket . 
  typically luc besson . 
  * [ beautiful lies ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1529569/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) a hairdresser re-mails an anonymous love letter sent to her to her mother in the hopes of perking her up . 
  it works a little too well - she wants more of them . 
  funny and endearing . 
  * [ monsters ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470827/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) an interesting , slightly eerie film . 
  what happens when you just give up fighting the alien monsters and just wall them off where they wo n't bother you any more ? 
  do n't go in thinking it 's pacific rim , that 's not the point of it . 
  * [ the intouchables ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) . 
  if you have n't seen this , go out and get it * right now * . 
  there 's a reason that it 's the second-best-selling french language film of all time . 
  * [ [ rec ] ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3 ) , another `` found footage '' film , this time a straight horror . 
  one of the better zombie movies i 've seen recently . 
  if you 've seen the american remake , you do n't really need to see this - it 's quite similar ( though the original is a bit more * raw * ) . 
  * [ rust and bone ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2053425/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) is a slow-burning drama / slice of life film . 
  it 's not going to get you majorly excited or worked up , but it 's a solid all-round film . 
  if you 're looking for series , [ attack on titan ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) is probably one of the most western-accessible anime series of the past few years . 
  drawing heavily on the traditions of war movies and horror tropes for the plotline , it has some gorgeous animation going on and a fantastic soundtrack . 
  suffers a little from pacing issues in the middle , though . 
  could you find me a feminist writer speaking out about this development in germany ? 
  `` hollande - always the first to offer his hand in friendship . '', 
  i think the problem is that while ireland 's the highest donor * per capita * , the small population means that it does n't appear to be raising as much as the heavy-hitters who can do so without even trying . 
  the problem is that there 's no judicial review . 
  if theresa may decided to expand the project so that `` criticising the uk government '' was just cause for stripping people of their british citizenship while they 're abroad , there 's no system in place to stop her from doing so . 
  we 'd be entirely reliant upon the press finding out and kicking up a fuss - a task which they 're getting worse at year-by-year . 
  i mean , i can kinda understand their perspective based on the experience in 2004 , with 500,000 poles ( ~ 1.2 % of poland 's population ) moving across in a very short space of time . 
  but that was a pretty unique situation , with the uk being ( one of ? ), 
  the only countries in the eu to end restrictions on their worker migration that year . 
  that 's not going to be the case with the new accessions . 
  which is a little sad , to be honest . 
  the uk economy benefitted * hugely * from the polish influx . 
  also , cameron 's announcement that he intends to block any further countries attempting to join the eu . 
  which is interesting in light of the scottish referendum next year , even if it 's clear that that 's not what he meant it about . 
  i suspect the vast majority of the documents snowden took with him are either trivial details , duplicates of material already released , or contain identifying information that prevents greenwald & co from releasing them . 
  that 's not to say that there is n't still a trove of newsworthy stories yet to come ; just that the `` only 1 % released so far '' that gets thrown around is likely to be overegging it a bit . 
  that would be the period following the glorious revolution , where william of orange ruled over england , scotland , ireland and the netherlands . 
  after his death the crowns split again , with the netherlands going to william iv and the `` british '' crowns going to anne . 
  because after having lived in the netherlands for a year , i 've yet to meet any dutch person who * has n't * had at least a basic grasp of english . 
  it 's actually really hard to get to practice dutch as they switch out immediately once they realise you 're british . 
  i do think that from a practical perspective they should probably allow english proficiency as a substitute - since that 's what natives are likely to try talking to you in anyway once they realise you 're not dutch . 
  cameron : `` looks like our increasingly right-wing policies are making us unpopular with the voting public . 
  better list further to the right ! '', 
  she looks more like a cross between [ minnie driver ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/minniedriverjan2011.jpg ) and [ paris hilton ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/hilton%2c_paris_%282007%29.jpg ) . 
  well , it 's one of only a dozen or so countries that england/gb/uk has n't tried to invade or attack at some point . 
  and socratic irony is n't yours , i assume ? 
  heck , why not just bring back the death penalty for any refugees who break the law , save the air-fare !, 
  the same thing annoyed me when the white house flat-out refused the proposed televised debate between ahmadinejad and obama a few years back , since they did n't want to give a platform to iranian rhetoric . 
  the worry was `` what if ahmedinejad 's debate points convince vulnerable american teenagers to become radicalised ? 
  '' , when it should have been `` we believe that our culture and message is the stronger '' , and that anyone watching would see a clear victory for the western viewpoint . 
  it was a huge missed opportunity for fostering cultural understanding between both nations . 
  they wo n't be government buildings ; it 's up to the local muslim community who gets to stay as imam . 
  i suppose germany could sponsor immigration of more sufis into the mosques ' areas , but something tells me that the public would not approve of such policies . 
  he was a much better speaker than he was a writer . 
  mein kampf is dry and rambling . 
  if it was n't for the author 's other claims to fame , it would n't be read at all . 
  planning permission for 200 huge mosques would probably take a while to get through at the best of times . 
  the tabloids had some fuel in that more than one in every forty poles upped sticks and moved to the uk when the borders opened ( which is a startling number ) . 
  it was n't too hard to believe on the face of it that an even higher proportion of romanians/bulgarians would do the same . 
  where the argument falls apart is that the polish situation was pretty unique . 
  the uk allowed fully unrestricted immigration immediately in 2004 where most other established eu nations had caps , and 2004-2008 were boom years for the uk economy . 
  not so much . 
  and even if a higher proportion of bulgarians * had * made the move it still would n't have the same impact that the polish migration did , for the simple fact that there are n't anywhere near as many bulgarians . 
  prevalency of a particular y-chromosome mutation . 
  it 's possible to trace shared ancestry by identifying particular mutations , since each mutation occurs only in a single individual and is then passed down to all their male progeny in every later generation . 
  this is how those genetic tests telling you if you 're a descendant of genghis khan work - some research a while back showed a particular y-chromosomal mutation was ridiculously prevalent in eastern asia and could be traced back to the 12th/13th century in mongolia . 
  if you test positive for that mutation , well , you 're a great-great-etc descendant of old temujin himself through an unbroken male line . 
  wales : wet this week . 
  wet last week . 
  wet every week . 
   not only you force me to type `` por '' instead of `` po '' when selecting my nationality on the internet this is why i want the united arab emirates to be annexed . 
  of course , even that would n't stop the problem entirely . 
  for that , we 'd also have to hunt down and lynch the people who create internet forms where england , britain and great britain are presented as choices in place of united kingdom . 
  splitting it into four states makes very little difference as far as representation in congress would go , for several reasons . 
  first of all , the total number of representatives going to the `` british states '' remains the same in total , as the population of the isles has n't changed . 
  more importantly , england alone retains the vast majority of the seats - 60/72 , still one and a half times the representation of the next closest state in the new union ( california , at 44 ) . 
  secondly , the split-off nations are either just as far to the left ( n.i. ), 
  or * even farther * left ( scotland and wales ) of the u.s. centre than england is . 
  in practice , they would vote more or less as a single bloc on national issues .
