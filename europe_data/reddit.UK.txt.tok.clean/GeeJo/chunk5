  in fact , by splitting them up you actually * increase * the political weight of the former uk , as they get more representation in the upper house . 
  instead of 2/52 senators , they are now represented by 8/58 , counting for over 1/7 of the senate by themselves . 
  england would still be the most populous state in the union , but it would at least bring it closer to the upper end of the current american batch ( though the same number of seats would be going to `` british '' representatives - that 's just how the system works ) . 
  that said , it would quadruple the former-uk 's influence in the senate . 
  more than one in seven of all u.s. senators would now be `` british '' , with the additional 6 welsh , scottish and norn irish senators being * even more * left-leaning than the `` 51st state '' solution . 
  the republicans would be throwing a shit-fit . 
   the real stumbling block for british domination of u.s. politics would be that we would still only have 2 senators representing us in the upper house . 
  i did mention that myself !, 
  the demographics would be * really * weird if the uk actually did become just `` the 51st state '' . 
  despite having a land area roughly the size of minnesota , our population is roughly one fifth of the entire population of the u.s. 
  since the maximum number of representatives in the u.s. congress is fixed at 435 by law , with distribution according to population , if the uk were to join it would have 72 of those seats . 
  as a comparison , the next highest state in terms of representation in the new order would be california , with just 44 seats . 
  and the new british members would be - by and large - * radically * left-leaning relative to the current political centre . 
  the real stumbling block for british domination of u.s. politics would be that we would still only have 2 senators representing us in the upper house . 
  still , the resulting chaos would be fascinating to watch . 
  [ or they 're making a joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  tell that to putin . 
  oh , hey , it turns out that all the members of the pound stirling union have voted that every country using it has to hand over # 10b to the uk . 
  there 's a treaty signed and everything . 
  so cough up . 
  what 's that - you were n't at the negotiations and did n't agree to the deal ? 
  who cares . 
  you do n't even use the pound ? 
  why does that matter ? 
  are n't we all part of the greater community ? 
  wow . 
  you 'd ** love it ** if 65 million people were forced through economic collapse just to gratify your sense that the euro is superior ? 
  that 's a lovely attitude . 
  this is what you get when a peninsula is broken up into feuding city states for a thousand years or so . 
  and mostly empty . 
  it has roughly the same population density as * latvia * , butt of all those cold-and-empty no-potato internet jokes . 
  they 'll probably just blame `` filthy foreigners '' instead . 
  nothing like a good hard nose-dive to the right to keep the poll numbers viable during a recession . 
  well , they 're likely to have plenty of free time again in the near future . 
  i do n't actually want to get rid of the pound , but it would be convenient if i could spend my euros at the local tesco too . 
  i guess i just want to both eat my cake and still have it . 
  there are always people willing to lend money if the interest rate is high enough . 
  people are still investing in * zimbabwean * government bonds as part of a diverse strategy , because they only need to pay off the interest * once * without printing more money to make investors massive gains , and $ 15 in a 5-figure portfolio really is negligible . 
  apparently 88 people are online at a time , and that 's enough to beat out the french !, 
  because by redefining the political centre as the old tory right and plonking your new party identity there , you capture all of the middle ground between that point and your old position on the left , while simultaneously forcing the opposition to shift further to the right to maintain their own identity - which in turn further splits their voter base . 
  this only works , of course , if the * actual * political centre of the country is farther right than labour 's old position . 
  but it pretty clearly was in the 90s , and the continued conservative victories this decade show that there 's probably still some room to go in the race to the right . 
  the unlimited blade works anime is great eye candy , though . 
  ufotable do know how to put together a pretty action scene . 
   especially when the only vns that work as anime are slice of life harems like clannad and amagami . 
  how do you feel about steins ; gate ? 
  italy . 
  and realistically you 'll need multiple trips to get even a fraction of what the peninsula has to offer . 
  while studying for my bachelors i had the fortune to be able to attend a four-week tour guided by a senior lecturer , and that ignited a life-long love of the country . 
  rome alone took two weeks of solid 10-hour days , and there was still a great deal left over to see in the city afterwards . 
  some of the highlights : * st peter 's basilica , then walking down the via della conciliazione to castel sant ` angelo . 
  * the vatican museum * palazzo barberini * farnese gallery * major churches such as santa maria del popolo and san giovanni in lateran * lesser churches like sant ` ivo alla sapienza , san carlino , and santa maria della pace * the colosseum and the palatine hill area in general * major fountains such as the trevi fountain , the triton fountain and especially the fountain of the four rivers . 
  add in the remains of the roman baths and aqueducts that often accompany them . 
  * fantastic restaurants practically everywhere , especially once you get away from the tourist traps . 
  the particular trip i went on then spent a week each in siena ( cathedral , town hall , santa caterina , day trip to orvietto , etc ) and florence ( uffizi , bargello , cathedral & baptistery , orsanmichele , santo spirito , day trip out to pontassieve , etc ) . 
  and this is only a tiny portion of the country . 
  i could make up similar lists focusing on venice , milan , bologna , napoli , and i 've still not been to sicily or genoa , sardinia or ravenna , etc. 
  italy has a * ridiculously * rich cultural heritage , fantastic weather , wonderful cuisine and beautiful countryside . 
  and coming from the uk , even the trains are an improvement despite the complaints i 've heard from other european travelers . 
  i 've spent a cumulative total of almost half a year of dedicated tourism in the country , and i 'm still not sick of it . 
  man , there 's a lot of swiss hate in this thread for some reason . 
  no country is perfect , but even by european standards switzerland is above the norm . 
  the levels of casual homophobia and racism are about the same in both , too . 
  the nice thing about the netherlands is that everywhere is ridiculously close by and they have good rail links . 
  if you find it too expensive to live in the city you 're studying in , there 's somewhere cheaper only 15 minutes away by train , and railcards are a bargain ( though that part is more from the perspective of an `` our country has the most expensive rail in europe '' brit ) . 
  about half the people on my course were living in den haag and commuting every day , as it 's even cheaper to live there than it is to live in leiden . 
  for general pricing , go to [ kamernet ] ( http://kamernet.nl ) and browse around what 's available , then look at the relevant city 's facebook housing page for deals . 
  arrange housing well in advance - do n't just turn up expecting there to be rooms everywhere . 
  if you go through the university 's agent , you 're going to get ... well , `` ripped off '' is a bit unfair , but they 'll push the more expensive options onto you when there is more economical student housing if you look for yourself . 
  leiden was honestly pretty affordable for me as a student , especially after currency conversion and lower cost of living was counted in . 
  a quick browse through kamernet shows that things have n't changed much since , price-wise . 
  i , too , read [ unsong ] ( http://unsongbook.com/ ) . 
  germany is only 12 places ahead of antarctica in terms of how many netflix shows are available . 
  ok , i ca n't read the original , so i am working off of the google translate version of the article :  the categories of full-time employed and entrepreneurs , ie people who mainly support themselves , constitute 69 percent of the total population between 20 and 64 years . 
  the same categories of refugees and refugee families was 25 percent after eight years in sweden and 34 percent after 15 years . 
  from having to deal with racists twisting statistics fucking * constantly * ( see : swedish `` 10,000 % increase in rape in 40 years ! '', 
  lies ) this phrasing triggers my bullshit detector : taking a second to parse it out , it is making two different claims : * 69 % of swedish 20-64 year olds are full-time employed * 34 % of all refugees ** and their families ** are full-time employed that is , from the autotranslate phrasing , the authors appear to have taken statistics of `` 69 % of the total population between 20 and 64 years '' and mapped it onto `` total population of all refugees and their families '' ? 
  given that the latter will include elderly and children , as well as full-time students , and the average is only 69 % for 20-64 year old natives , 34 % does not seem surprising for an employment rate . 
  i would need to see the study data itself to be sure . 
  i 'm sure that the best way of convincing people to your side of the argument is to use memes from / pol / . 
  adds a great deal of legitimacy to your rhetoric , that . 
  if the random stranger 's kid popped out of a woman who i had been in a relationship with * knowing * that they were with child and i 'd put my name on the birth certificate , yeah . 
  it 's a sucky situation and i 'd feel like an idiot , but it 's not the kid 's fault . 
  to clarify the situation , let 's take the emotional baggage associated with the `` betrayal '' out of consideration . 
  imagine that my wife had n't cheated - she 'd been raped , and had made the hard choice to carry the child to term anyway . 
  even knowing this , i 'd stuck with her , but our relationship breaks down a month after the child is born for unrelated reasons and i want to leave . 
  the child has exactly the same amount of genetic material from me in either case - zero . 
  same child . 
  the only difference is my relationship with the mother , which is separate from and should have no bearing on my relationship with or responsibilities towards the child . 
  i 'd made the tacit agreement to act as the father both before and after the birth , and i ca n't escape that just because i 've decided i do n't like the mother much any more . 
  it 's a case where practicalities and outcomes overrule `` justice '' - the child and i have equal rights , but * someone 's * rights have to be violated whichever way the decision goes , and i 'm more able to recover from losing the child support money than the child is . 
  sure , and if it turns out that it 's not my kid i accept that in the interests of the child i should still be providing support regardless of the outcome . 
  i 'd still like to know , though , as it would affect whether that support would be from within the household or from without . 
   maybe we should photoshop the country bigger and use it to prove we 're the largest country in the world !, 
  seems to work well for greenland . 
  going by the average map it 's about the same size as africa . 
  the schengen treaty allows border controls to be implemented * temporarily * as an emergency measure , with a set time limit . 
  i believe that the germans are still in the middle of that period at the moment . 
   i would n't . 
  if that ever happened with diplomats it would cause all relations to be broken and possibly start a war .
