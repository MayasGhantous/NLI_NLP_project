  and exactly that has happened in the past . 
  we 're probably past the days of emissaries ' heads being sent back as a declaration of war , but you only need to go back to the 60s to find the u.s. struggling to keep black ambassadors from being subjected to the indignities of jim crow laws while they 're visiting . 
  immunity is a tiny concession to make in order to smooth diplomatic relations between nation-states , when the stakes are that high . 
  i 'd rather have diplomats getting away with traffic violations than the alternative , which is giving more dubious nations free rein to arrest and harass western diplomats whenever the political climate suits them . 
  diplomats and foreign officials have been given protection as far back as we have written records , and for good reason . 
  slovenia , probably . 
  i could n't name a single city , person , sports team or geographical feature from there . 
  i do n't know a single word of the language , where i can at least come out with a swear word or two for most of the rest of the continent . 
  i do n't know whether it 's rightist , leftist or centrist as european politics go , or their general position on the eu or any other political matter . 
  i do n't know what they eat there , or how they dress , or who their national and historical rivalries/friendships are with . 
  i 've never met anyone from there in person . 
  i can only place it on the map by process of elimination , i only know its flag right now by checking the mouseover on the sidebar graphic , and i constantly get the name mixed up with slovakia . 
  the only thing i know about slovenia is that i do n't know very much about it . 
   `` it is an offence for any person , without lawful authority or good reason , to have with him ( or her ) in a public place , any article which has a blade or is sharply pointed except for a folding pocket-knife which has a cutting edge to its blade not exceeding 3 inches . '', 
  the law 's been on the books for nearly thirty years in the uk . 
  the vast majority of people are fine with it , though there are always edge cases ( which is what the `` good reason '' clause is there for ) . 
  a note for people who do not read articles : the embryos will not be implanted , let alone brought to term . 
  this is preliminary experimentation largely in an attempt to discover a particular ` faulty ' mutation and improve ivf success rates . 
  it will be done using ` leftover ' embryos from ivf treatments , and the results - successful or no - will be terminated after 14 days . 
  is it a big and controversial step towards genetic editing becoming available ? 
  yes . 
  are the next generation of genetic supermen only nine months away ? 
  uk junior doctors ( from their first year post qualification up to as late as 9-10 years of training after that , basically anyone that is not a consultant - attending ) are striking today after recent negotiations between the government and the doctors union - the bma . 
  the strikes were initially supposed to be around christmas time however were cancelled at last minute the night before as the government agreed to negotiations through a third party . 
  the reason for the strikes are surrounding shift patterns , shift lengths , pay and changes to training/part time contracts . 
  this first strike is emergency only - basically weekend cover with some junior doctors providing emergency cover for the on call shifts . 
  two more strikes are planned with a full walkout ( hopefully with consultant cover ) planned in february . 
  never mind the art museums , the advertising posters would be enough . 
  the ira tended to give warnings about its public bombings . 
  then they 'd hide secondary bombs to catch emergency responders ( police/army , rather than fire/ambulance , so they were considered fair game ) . 
  india/pakistan in kashmir ? 
  i mean , it 's not a perfect example but there are only nine countries to work with in the first place . 
  i do n't think they quite understood that the votes rarely have much to do with how good the song was . 
  maybe use the old leper colonies that used to dot the mediterranean . 
  i tried it for a while , but it just gave me the same `` playing with a spreadsheet '' feeling that eve online did . 
  there were so many sliders and dials that had no apparent immediate effect but would screw me down the line with no notice . 
  on the plus side , it 's the smallest rise for half a decade . 
  on the downside , it 's still above inflation ( which has been effectively zero this year ) and is making the most expensive rail in europe even more expensive . 
  it still seems silly to me that the rail fare to the airport costs me almost twice the price of actually flying across the continent . 
  but what are you going to do ? 
  re-nationalising the system is n't even on the political radar , for all that the promise of competition lowering prices has failed to come true . 
  i remember that ad campaign . 
  i ca n't remember who sponsored it , but it was a good message to put out to first-time voters . 
  and the fact that it 's still brought to mind this many years on shows it probably had some effect . 
  it still makes more sense to actually ask questions about those institutions rather than infer expertise from largely unrelated questions , though , if that 's what you 're interested in finding out . 
  appealing to the sentiment of `` founding fathers '' in the eu is n't going to get you much effect . 
  there is n't the same cultishness around them as there is for the u.s. 
  so borrow money from the jews , * then * kick them out . 
  600g should see you through long enough to siege down the castle enough that your mercenaries can meatshield their way through the rest of it . 
  after all , if most of them die , the upkeep is lower . 
  a few months ago .

  glorious revolution !, 
  it 's 1688 all over again !, 
  and the french . 
  but that 's more on general principle . 
  `` dobby never meant to kill !, 
  dobby only meant to maim , or seriously injure ! '',

  estonian would suddenly become the 8th most-spoken language in the u.s. , between german and korean . 
  never mind scots , i 'm inclined to believe that glaswegian english should be classified as a separate language . 
  yep . 
  though it 's worthwhile to note that brown took over after blair resigned , and major after thatcher resigned . 
  of the past five transitions of power , three would be `` undemocratic '' by those criteria . 
  thatcher-major : ** undemocratic ** 2 . 
  major-blair : democratic 3 . 
  blair-brown : ** undemocratic ** 4 . 
  brown-cameron : democratic 5 . 
  cameron-may : ** undemocratic ** it 's just something we seem to do a lot . 
  honestly nobody would be able to tell the difference afterwards . 
  if you count those too apathetic to show up and vote at all as being equally culpable , it 's closer to 80 % deserving the results . 
  this was the original approach for some . 
  in at least one way spain is probably happy about the brits leaving - now scottish independence and a smooth joining of the eu will set no precedent for the catalans . 
   more entrants means more competition for the same resources unless their entry means resource availability increases commensurately !, 
  which is a pretty low bar to meet . 
  humans bring a lot of utility with them , even unskilled ones , and migration policy favours skilled migrants in the first place . 
  or do you believe that , as a general rule , you can efficiently grow a country 's economy by removing large segments of its population ? 
  though as someone who plays too many historical grand strategy games like europa universalis , i 'm still saddened and confused when i see that lithuania does n't look much [ like this ] ( http://guides.gamepressure.com/europauniversalisiv/gfx/word/19509297.jpg ) any more . 
  i 'm impressed they 've built up enough of a pension to retire comfortably in their 50s , then . 
  i more or less agree . 
  when your remaining life expectancy in years enters the single digits , i think you get a pass from being expected to pick up an entirely new language when you can get away without doing it . 
  on the other hand , both the cross and the dragon tie in to the whole st george thing quite neatly . 
  i 'm sure the spanish had much the same thing to say about the united provinces a few hundred years ago . 
  statistically , ireland has a high rate of celiac disease compared to the european average . 
  celiacs ca n't eat gluten , which is common in most grains . 
  the title should really be changed to `` vegetables and carbohydrates '' , i suppose . 
   but duolingo is not sending your ** the best spanish words ** . 
  they send you ** the insults , the blasphemies ** . 
  but those are the same thing !, 
  if learning the local language is a bad thing ( because it indicates they 're planning on staying , rather than returning home when the crisis is over ) , and * not * learning the local language is a bad thing ( because it shows a lack of respect for the nation hosting them ) , what are refugees supposed to do ?

  the bank of scotland prints its own banknotes . 
  they 're still pounds sterling , but they 're in different colours with different people on the face . 
  they 're legal tender in scotland , and banks in england will accept them . 
  but english shopkeepers are n't * forced * to take them and they tend to be unfamiliar with how they look , so there 's counterfeit concerns . 
  if you 're american , the practicalities of the situation are pretty similar to your $ 2 banknotes .
