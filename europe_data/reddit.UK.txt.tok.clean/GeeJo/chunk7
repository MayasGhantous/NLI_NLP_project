  sure , they exist , but they 're unfamiliar to a lot of people and that can cause minor embarrassment or hassle . 
  if scotland decided to make the queen head of government in addition to being head of state , she would probably appoint a governor to rule day-to-day in her name . 
  it probably makes things easier for charitable donations if they 're officially registered as a synagogue . 
  cheap and easy dessert : ** banoffee pie ** * 1 packet of digestives/ginger biscuits * 1 small can of condensed milk * 1 pot double cream ( or whipped cream ) * 1 or 2 bananas * knob of butter #base 1 . 
  put the biscuits in a mixing bowl or bag and mash them into crumbs either by hand or with a rolling pin 2 . 
  melt the butter , mix with the biscuit crumbs 3 . 
  press biscuit/butter firmly into the bottom of a cake tin . 
  use the end of your rolling pin or something . 
  #creme de leche 4 . 
  put the ** unopened ** can of condensed milk into a saucepan of water . 
  boil it for an hour , making sure that the water level never drops below the top of the can . 
  open the can , spread contents evenly over the biscuit base . 
  slice a banana or two , pressing slices into the top #cream 7 . 
  leave the mix in the fridge for twenty minutes or more 8 . 
  whip the double cream ( or get it pre-whipped ) and spread over the top . 
  grate a square of chocolate over if you want to . 
  done . 
  delicious dessert requiring only one hob and no measuring or careful timing . 
  just remove the pie from the cake tin and slice it up . 
  every country has its share of perverts and deviants . 
  `` you 'd be speaking german if we had n't won the war for you . '', 
  `` it 's called ` soccer ' . '', 
  `` prince charles has some great ideas . '', 
  `` milk goes in before the teabag ; tastes better that way . '', 
  yeah , it 's honestly getting a little old . 
  not every slope is slippery . 
  most are very comfortable to rest on . 
  there 's an odd sort of absolutism becoming popular where no ambiguity and no distinction is allowed - anything less than absolute maximum freedom is somehow inevitably going to cause a descent into despotism . 
  the 9/11 attacks are closer in time to the fall of the berlin wall than to the present day . 
  by quite a ways now , actually . 
   the uk will be nothing more than england and a bunch of useless micro-territories that 's a pretty harsh way of describing wales . 
  my brain keeps trying to see it as a coastline map . 
  ca n't even send off the dead in a respectable manner . 
  that would largely depend on the terms of brexit . 
  i holiday in europe several times a year , and free visaless movement directly benefits me . 
  my business sells to european schools as well as british ones , and tax uniformity/reciprocal vat treaties make payment a lot easier . 
  ibacc is also continuing to grow as a standardised examination format , whereas the uk government ca n't decide what the fuck it wants to do when it comes to teaching computing/ict . 
  also , just two years ago i got my masters at leiden , for a ** tenth ** the price of what it would have cost in an english university . 
  this was entirely because i 'm an eu citizen as well as a british one and could shop around . 
  while i 'm obviously past the point where that would benefit me directly now , i 'd certainly prefer my kids to have the same option . 
  probably yelling at his yoghurt . 
  he claims that it 's disgraceful that milk is willing to change when a foreign culture is introduced . 
  honestly a lot of proverbs rings true today . 
  slightly earlier in the same chapter as op 's quote is :  do not answer a fool according to his folly ,  or you yourself will be just like him . 
  which is basically `` do not feed the trolls . '', 
  it 's kind of sad . 
  it 's almost certain that there was a * specific prank * that caused the annoyed writer to include this . 
  and we will never know what it was . 
  got ta admit , though , `` flaming arrows of death '' sounds metal as fuck . 
  [ macedonian naming dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute ) . 
  it 's enough of an argument that even the wiki article is flagged as going on for too long . 
  in short , there 's a slavic country called macedonia , and there 's a part of greece traditionally called macedonia , so they each object to the other `` stealing '' the name . 
  it 's made even fuzzier by the fact that ancient macedonia covered both areas , but was n't slavic . 
  like everything in that entire region , it 's mostly an excuse to shout at each other while everyone else looks on in bewilderment . 
  but then we 've got a similar issue of recalcitrant pedantry right here on the `` british isles '' so stones and glass houses and all that . 
  also syrian , armenian , and several others i 'm surely forgetting . 
  `` eastern '' is a standard label to bunch them together . 
  and since we 're being technical , an extra bonus : there are also catholic churches that are n't roman catholic . 
  eastern catholics acknowledge papal authority and are still counted as part of the catholic church . 
  but they use their own traditions and liturgies , rather than the latin rites most catholics are familiar with . 
  put together , they only make up about 1 % of the catholic faithful , so most people - even some popes - still tend to treat `` catholic '' and `` roman catholic '' as being synonymous . 
  including neil hamilton , the closest british scientists have ever come to creating a slime mould that can speak human language . 
  it was brown who pawned off the gold :p, 
  i do n't feel it 's likely , but it 's certainly * possible * . 
  there were bombs going off only 20 years ago . 
  the people who set them are still alive , and for the most part have n't changed their views . 
  they just settled for the compromise of the gfa . 
  the ` civil war ' would n't be on the scale of , say , syria . 
  it would just be a handful of nutcases who feel that since `` the other side '' has gone back on the deal , they should do the same , but with violence . 
  prompting a retaliation , which leads to another . 
  cue a return to the low-level ongoing hostilities of the 90s . 
  king james i of england was the second person to travel by submarine , back around 1600 or so . 
  just got out the shower , so probably like coconuts . 
  it 's what my conditioner smells like , anyway . 
  lived in england , wales , and the netherlands . 
  i earned a degree while at each of them , too !, 
  visited italy , australia and peru for several months apiece , though i was too young when my family visited australia to remember any of it . 
  week-long visits to the united states , spain , austria , greece , france , germany , scotland and denmark . 
  `` visited '' one or two more just as airport layovers , but i do n't think that really counts . 
  so ** fourteen ** countries total , of which only ** three ** are outside of europe ( united states , peru , australia ) . 
  of those i visited , i had the most fun in italy . 
  of those i 've lived in , i preferred england . 
  in english , `` th '' . 
  we underestimate its global rarity because it happens to be present in a handful of other popular languages like spanish and arabic , but it 's actually a pretty unusual phoneme . 
  most of the time it will just be approximated with an f or v . in welsh , `` ll '' . 
  visiting english give up and use `` thl '' , even once told that they really do n't sound similar . 
  i thought not . 
  its not a story the front national would tell you . 
  i think cymru sounds more poetic , and it avoids terrible `` whale '' puns . 
  but there 's something to be said for being one of the few countries with a monosyllabic english name , and different vowel pronunciation means people unfamiliar with the language pronounce cymru as `` kaimroo '' , which is just terrible . 
  * dwyrain canol * , translating to middle east . 
  alternatively , * middle east * , which handily also translates to middle east . 
  soused herrings ? 
  that 's about all i remember that was n't either turkish , indonesian or fast-food . 
  going by the music played in supermarkets , yes . 
  i got drunk and slipped into a canal in leiden . 
  thankfully it was off of a shallow grass bank and i managed to get back out , though i lost one of my shoes and my phone was a write-off . 
  welsh is * extremely * common in my corner of north wales . 
  if there 's a non-welsh speaker , the conversation will always be in english , but otherwise it 's up in the air which language people will greet you in and the other party to the conversation will go along with it . 
  a few , mostly older , people are more comfortable in welsh than english .
