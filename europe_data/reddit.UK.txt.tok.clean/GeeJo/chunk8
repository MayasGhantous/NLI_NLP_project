  on the other end of the scale some `` speak welsh '' by virtue of just having welsh grammar strung together with a mostly-english vocabulary ( which can be funny to listen to , with sentences swinging back and forth at random ) . 
  but generally one 's as good as the other . 
  few of the english retirees or tourists attempt to learn it , though . 
  i do n't really blame them . 
  there 's very little incentive ; people learn welsh growing up or not at all .

  it tastes like road scrapings . 
  instant coffee at home . 
  americano at a cafe . 
  headed down to the castle on my lunch break . 
  22:00 here . 
  assuming it 's not pouring with rain tomorrow , i can take a picture of [ harlech castle ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/harlech+castle/@52.8594846,-4.1086156,3a,75y,327.47h,85.08t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sq-nttevpkiatelm14d1aiq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dq-nttevpkiatelm14d1aiq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d332.02698%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x48659d8e3547aa9f:0xd57712cb9225529d!8m2!3d52.8599986!4d-4.1089014!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  bear in mind that it 's not going to look as bright and sunny - even if it 's * not * raining , it 's going to be overcast . 
   not for it , since extreme californian independence groups are supported by russia the merit of an idea is independent of who is supporting it . 
  if putin held a press conference where he declared that the sky was blue , that does n't mean americans should counter that it 's green just to spite him . 
  they 'd have to restructure the party 's `` manifesto '' , dropping some planks to solidify support around the few areas that matter most to their core . 
  if the dems compromised their positions on gun control and immigration , for example , they 'd be able to grab more of the centre where those two issues are make-or-break without losing * that much * support from their existing base . 
  advocating a ban on abortion would , sadly , regain them more votes than any other single flip-flop as it 's by far the largest cause of single-issue voting in the u.s. , but i 'd personally hope that they would n't go there before other options are explored . 
  the fetishism of england for * political purposes * ( rather than just general anglophilia ) comes in two flavours . 
  one is for the nhs , which in american healthcare debates is alternately held up as a shining beacon of divine hope or as a government-intrusion-gone-mad bureaucratic `` death panel '' nightmare . 
  the reality is , of course , somewhere in between . 
  the other is the more recent brexit thing . 
  i do n't honestly blame americans for thinking that it 's causing some kind of massive social rift between the two camps given how the discussion plays out online , but in real life while there 's debate going on , there 's nowhere near as much acrimony about it . 
  beatrice - diphthong of i\u02d0\u0259 . 
  beau - \u0259\u028a , and beauty - ju . 
  though that 's * really * `` eau '' , it still contains `` ea '' as a substring . 
  perfect !, 
  exactly what i was after . 
  the latter definitely sounds more fluid , to the point where , if i was trying to learn the language , i 'd wonder why i 'd bothered with all those hard consonants at all . 
  a lot of people are saying that there 's no * official * way of indicating their language 's contractions in text the way that english does , but are there words or phrases in croatian that are pronounced sloppily/loosely compared to how they appear in text ? 
  could you give an example ? 
  i know you 've just said it 's not expressed in writing , but a comparison between what 's typed and what 's said . 
  use english-style apostrophes to indicate the missing sounds , if you want . 
  as ever , 4chan 's / pol / board [ has their own charming opinion ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pjt62gw.jpg ) on this quandary . 
  [ cheapest brothel in birmingham ] ( http://www.poundland.co.uk/wordpress/poundland/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/store-front-rt1.jpg ) . 
  i 'm partial to `` poundland '' , myself . 
  i 'm not sure this is going to be the most interesting set of replies , since most are going to be bare lists . 
  * england ( born and raised here ) * wales ( moved here as an adult ) * scotland ( two week holiday to edinburgh and the area around it ) * france ( week-long school trip to paris , charity work to nice ) * netherlands ( a year - got my masters in leiden , lived in den haag ) * belgium ( passing through ) * germany ( hitchhiked to berlin and back ) * austria ( week 's holiday to vienna , side-trip to salzburg ) * italy ( month-long university trip to rome , orvietto , siena , florence ) * the vatican , having been in st peters and the vatican museum . 
  * spain ( multiple childhood holidays to the baleares ) * denmark ( took the ferry to go visit legoland as a very young child ) * greece ( holiday centred in athens , but ran out of things to do there so a lot of day trips to the islands , to corinth , to delphi , etc ) of the places i 've been in for more than a week at a time , the netherlands is probably my favourite . 
  central leiden is chocolate-box pretty , and everywhere is cheap and quick to get to . 
  my trips * outside * of europe are a lot more barebones - florida ( for two weeks , mostly visiting theme parks ) , peru ( for a month , backpacking and travelling ) , australia ( for six months as a baby - i remember literally nothing ) , china ( for a year as an esl teacher ), 
  we do n't really have that much in the way of folk costume in england . 
  some up in scotland , but not so much here . 
  [ morris dancing costumes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ahcl3aj.jpg ) are probably the most familiar . 
  there 's a modern subset of morris dancing called molly dancing , where the costumes are [ straight-up ridiculous ] ( http://www.morrisdancing.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/morris-dancers-southbank-054.jpg ) . 
  noah was unusual for a long time , but seems to be coming back into fashion . 
  i 'm currently living in rural north wales , so a car is pretty much necessary for any spontaneous journey . 
  buses and trains * are * available , but only once an hour with no trains on sundays . 
  if you plan ahead it is n't so bad - a fifteen minute walk to the station/bus stop , albeit down a very steep hill . 
  bikes are n't worth the hassle with 10-15 % gradients everywhere . 
  before that i lived in the netherlands , so bikes to get everywhere local and trains anywhere less local . 
  none ; it 's not a good idea . 
  too divisive . 
  how about as a celebration of parliamentarianism , we put ** oliver cromwell ** on there !, 
  awful lot of roman candidates , so how about we give italy five notes/coins where other countries get zero !, 
  i live on the welsh coast of the irish sea , so 12 nautical miles to the end of our national border and another 40 or so until entering irish waters . 
  crossed the distance a fair amount while helping on my grandfather 's boat in summers . 
  only once for my own reasons , though , on a holiday to cork . 
  i kind of wanted to visit st petersburg , but the visa process is such a pain in the ass . 
  # 50 per application , and you have to visit either london or edinburgh for the interview . 
  london 's 6 hours and # 70 by train in each direction , and edinburgh 's worse . 
  then another 12-hour # 140 round trip just to pick it up ( with a bonus # 50 fee ) when they 're done processing it , since they wo n't mail it . 
  i mean , i know it 's largely my own fault for living out in the sticks , but # 350-400 and two solid days on trains is not worth it just for permission to get into russia . 
  not when i can get a train to liverpool and fly out to anywhere in europe with no papers required beyond the passport . 
  at least for the next few years , anyway . 
  coffee is better than tea . 
   right now we should strive towards the resolution of our current problems https://xkcd.com/1232/, 
  punctuation , apparently . 
  so many , comma splices . 
  grocer 's apostrophe 's everywhere . 
  some punctuation is just forgotten ; semi-colons seem to be terrifying , for example . 
  people prefer almost any other mark over the parenthetical semi-colon -- even badly-used dashes are more common these days . 
  or worse - hyphens . 
  its , it 's , its ' and the inconsistent oxford comma are other common trip-ups . 
  i always assumed it was `` sub-section '' , as it looks like two ss on top of one another . 
  ** interslavic ** might be an interesting option . 
  you can be * understood * speaking or writing it at a very high rate in a whole host of european countries , though you yourself will struggle to understand when reading or listening to them back , once they step into their language-specific vocabulary . 
  many might not be aware , but in china there are dozens of `` duplicate cities '' that copy massive sections of major european and american cities wholesale , right down to the bricks . 
  i taught english for a year in suzhou and i 'd heard that there was a suburban area in ( relatively ) nearby shanghai called `` thames town '' that was supposed to be the spitting image of a generic english market-town . 
  i figured it 'd be fun for a visit . 
  i was n't wrong , but it was * bizarre * , like walking into some alternate reality where china decided to get into the whole imperialism game early and colonised the uk . 
  while i was there i went into a `` genuine english pub '' looking to order the very prominently advertised `` sunday lunch '' . 
  with the weirdness of the faux-british architecture outside and the kind of touristy feel of the whole place , i was kind of hoping for a taste of home - roast beef and gravy with carrots and parsnips , or something like it . 
  turns out ? 
  not bad by any means , and certainly a lot cheaper than a pub lunch back home . 
  but i ca n't help feeling that they missed the point a little . 
  or maybe it was just me .
