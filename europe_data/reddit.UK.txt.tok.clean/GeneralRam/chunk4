  hopefully the outcome could be something like this - https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/06/richard-o-dwyer-avoids-us-extradition, 
  why ? 
  the majority of turkey want that twat there . 
  the house of lords is brilliant in my book . 
  they do n't have to think about getting elected every 5 years so do exactly what they think is best . 
  you 're right that mallorca is 2/3 's german . 
  but balearic 's as a whole is much closer - * ( 125 ) united kingdom 3174210 * ( 126 ) germany 3569776 source : http://www.ibestat.cat/ibestat/estadistiques/per-territori/1/ef88f7cf-8e0b-44e0-b897-85c2f85775ec/es/i208002_3001.px, 
  baleraric germany should be half germany , half uk . 
  especially in majorca, 
  boris will not be involved with the brexit negotiation . 
  that falls to david davis . 
  here are his views http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/07/david-davis-trade-deals-tax-cuts-and-taking-time-before-triggering-article-50-a-brexit-economic-strategy-for-britain.html, 
  i 'm related to hermann goering ( yes that hermann goering ) . 
  a family member of his fled nazi germany to britain and i 'm a descendant of him . 
  i just need to get my dad to get off his fat arse and get his family tree from his aunty who has done all the work on the family tree . 
  i can then find out who exactly my ancestor is and see if they lost their citizenship . 
  if they had their citizenship taken off them i should be able to get german citizenship . 
  in german law -  under article 116 of germany 's constitution , known as the basic law , anyone who had their german citizenship revoked during the nazi regime for `` political , racist , or religious reasons '' may reobtain citizenship . 
  the article also includes the descendants of nazi victims , and does not require them to give up the citizenship of their new home countries . 
  i also work for a german company and can transfer over to germany if i wish . 
  we blocked the eu putting tariffs on chinese steel . 
  we 've been china 's bitch for the past couple of years and will do anything to get their money at the moment . 
  including bending over and taking it . 
  that is clever . 
  gideon ai n't as dumb as he looks !, 
  did n't osborne put into law that a government must always run a surplus ? 
  would n't that be binding a future government ? 
   keep their eu citizenship ( separate from the uk one ) with its rights and priviledges as well - in exchange for some additional tax or whatever . 
  i would love it if i was able to do this . 
  sadly i do n't think that will happen :(, 
  watch this video with philip hammond - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36707573 he puts the point across quite well , it is in neither the eu 's or the uk 's interest to kick brits/eu 's out of their current countries . 
  imagine the shit storm it would cause if we guaranteed eu nationals to stay here but the eu kicks all the brits out - that would cause an enormous problem back home with the media backlash . 
  nobody will get kicked out . 
  serves the peasants right for voting out . 
  could that not be why he has left ? 
  he 's now going to be involved with every politics/talk show for the next few years . 
  i loved bratislava when i visited a few months ago . 
  i was gutted i was only there for a day :(, 
  exactly the same feelings here . 
  although i may be able to get german citizenship which i will do if it 's possible . 
  i would love it if she did !, 
  i 'm in the east midlands and everyone says chinky . 
  i even rang my chinese mate and asked `` hey mate , where 's your chinky ? '', 
  although admittedly i just think oh shit when i said it . 
  i do n't think he does . 
  he never wanted to have this referendum in the first place . 
  on election night he had produced speeches for every result eventuality except a tory majority which is what he got !, 
  being a dick to the uk could quite easily backfire and could possibly backfire which would cause the anti-eu parties of other countries to shout louder ( `` the eu is a big bully ! '', 
  etc ) . 
  the eu has a delicate balancing task on their hands . 
  they ca n't give a good deal , but they ca n't be a dick either . 
  if the uk say no , the eu goes and does it anyway but excludes the uk . 
  or that 's what it seems most of the time !, 
  if more prominent figures took your viewpoint i think remain would have a better chance !, 
  sadly a lot of people are expecting that i think . 
  exactly . 
  the leave camp are campaigning for leaving both the eu and the eea and negotiate a separate trade agreement . 
  they think it 'll be favourable because `` bmw wo n't want us to stop buying their cars . '', 
  exactly . 
  but i think the money people bring in is too enticing a lot of the time . 
  did n't malia go down hill once they introduced a minimum price for alcohol ? 
  we were n't against a banking tax if it was applied internationally . 
  we were against a tax just at eu level . 
  finance is a worldwide market and not just a european one and in doing so would cause london to lose ground to new york and singapore . 
  london just so happens to be the reason why the uk is as rich as it is . 
  the uk will defend it 's biggest cash cow above all else . 
  it 's because the idiots in this country think ukip will fight for uk interests when they just abstain from everything . 
  i went to timisoara on a business trip . 
  i loved the place !, 
  i hope to go again soon !, 
  i 'm generally a remain voter , but if he 's issuing threats like this i 'll vote to leave , ... 
  i have n't thought of it like that before . 
  you could be right !, 
  cheers for that !, 
  it seems a much better method . 
  is this your profession or something ? 
  you know quite a bit on the subject . 
  i 'm 5ft7 and weigh 198lbs which is about 31 on the bmi i think ? 
  i 'm also a 34inch waist . 
  if someone with a 34inch waist is obese then i need to question my existence . 
  i believe it 's genetic as the doctor told my dad to completely ignore bmi as it 'd be impossible for him to hit a ` healthy ' weight due to his build . 
  i workout about 5 hours a week . 
  but my diet and weekend party lifestyle ruins it . 
  according to my bmi i 'm obese . 
  but i 'd just say i was overweight . 
  unfortunately not . 
  i think someone died on new years day :( edit : https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/02/british-soldier-dies-iraq-incident-not-result-enemy-activity/amp/ not quite new year 's day i do n't think but this article reported it on the 3rd . 
  if something is made for collecting or an investment it is n't wise to buy .

  i replied to / u/bond0815 on my reasons for going `` hard brexit '' https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5odzyt/theresa_may_to_confirm_uk_exit_from_eu_single/dcjc40k/?st=iy1hv3xq&amp;sh=701fff56 however i had completely forgot we could do our own deals with being in efta so ignore my last point . 
  but the others stand . 
  currently the uk has the best deal . 
  we are a full member of the eu , we have veto powers and have a rebate on our money contribution . 
  now if we had a `` soft brexit '' , which i am going to assume is joining efta . 
  we lose our advantages of our current deal while keeping the mechanisms in place which caused people to vote leave . 
  * we lose veto powers . 
  this was recently used by david cameron to stop a tax on our banks . 
  without it , the eu could essentially force the rules upon us and incentivise industry to move away from the uk . 
  * we lose the rebate and would have to pay in around the same amount as we did before ( assuming it costs around the same as norway ) .
