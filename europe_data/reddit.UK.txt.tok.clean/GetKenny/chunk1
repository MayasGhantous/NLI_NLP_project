   but it has similarities with french since we conquered them 1000 years ago it 's ok , time is a great healer  plus we got a lot of our vocab from your lovely language . 
  and yes , i too think we have a lot in common , even if we did kick your arse in the age of empires , 
  you really have . 
  you 've miss-read what i posted .

  that was very ... specific . 
  you 're missing the point completely . 
  that 's known as meta racism . 
  ethnicity is a synonym for race . 
  if there is a difference it 's not clearly defined . 
  even when they 're really drunk ? 
  who said it was problem free . 
  you must be confusing my comments with someone else 's  but it turns out it 's not a fantastically more fun experience to be a working-class minority in the uk or denmark than in china or brazil . 
  what bull . 
  how do you know it is n't ? 
  racism in south korea ? 
  [ lmgtfy ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=racial+discrimination+in+south+korea ), 
  i was just thinking of people at random really . 
  wrighty always struck me as a bit of a ` man of the people ' . 
  i could probably take one sentence out of any dialogue and make it mean something else . 
  look at the comments as a whole if you 're interested in the meaning . 
  i never said for a second that it does n't exist , but if you 're going to be realistic about things you 're going to have to admit some truth in what i 'm saying . 
  and if you want to put it into * those * terms , i 'm proud of what we have achieved so far , and i absolutely * will * look at some other countries and think to myself `` thank god i 'm not a [ racial minority ] / [ gay person ] / [ insert difference here ] living there '' . 
  ok , so you found a rarely used law which i admit i missed . 
  there is still no comparison in racism between most of asia and western europe . 
  it does n't take a genius to [ look it up . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_ethnic_nationalism )  bath house case  on october 2011 , soojin goo , a naturalized south korean citizen formerly from uzbekistan was denied entry to a public bath house in busan , south korea for being a `` foreigner '' despite showing her south korean passport and resident registration card . 
   according to the bath house , the denial was based on `` regular patrons ' fear of contracting aids '' . 
  after being denied entry , goo sought help from local police . 
  however , goo was told to seek other baths houses since there are no legal basis for prosecuting ethnic discrimination in south korean law . 
  [ 11 ] after this story caught the national attention in south korea , many other cases of ethnic discrimination were reported . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism_in_south_korea ), 
  the point is that in the uk , for example , and any western european country afaik anyone sending a message like this would be liable to prosecution . 
  this is not so in korea , for example . 
  also , it is possible for someone who is ethnically ` foreign ' to become a fully recognised citizen of , say , the uk . 
  ian wright , krishnan murphy , chuka umunna are all examples of many many prominent people who are not white , but are generaly looked on as just as british as someone who is . 
  i can not think of any asian country where this could happen . 
  do n't kid yourself , while we still have a way to go in defeating racism , looking out at most of the rest of the world , it is so much worse . 
  exactly ? 
  so the people in korea that sent that message will be prosecuted under korean law ? 
  you 're right of course . 
  but do you really think that this kind of racism would be so accepted in the west that they could be so open about it ? 
  there 's a sun headline in there somewhere ... 
  because these long term economic forecasts are always spot on , 
  if you 're going to do it , you might as well do it properly . 
  seriously though , we get lulled into a sense of this kind of thing being in the past , because of where we come from , but it 's scary how much of this still exists outside of western culture . 
  i know . 
  it 's very sad . 
  from now on all it will take is a handful of shouty pseudo martyrs on twitter to start whining and they wo n't be able to burn any more effigies at lewes . 
  they used to keep the effigies a close secret , perhaps they should do that next year . 
  they did n't . 
  so , on average , people in the uk dress a little better ? 
  cool ,

  the oligarchs might have a few boisterous champagne and caviare parties in kensington & belgravia . 
  there was such an outcry from the scottish that the police advised against burning salmond . 
  so they did n't . 
  if that new cathedral stands for 1000 years ... 
  we should all ignore the forbiddance of our governments from time to time . 
  history . 
  probably , but the police do n't publish anything like a map that discloses where they all are , but i would guess if you 're going from one small town or village to an other you probably would n't . 
  i think the british and the germans have slightly different views about surveillance , in that the british are generally more relaxed about it . 
  do you think that might have something to with all of the post war surveillance that went on , especially in what was eastern germany ? 
  i do n't have an alternative , but i do know an important thing to keep in mind when dealing with other nations : never humiliate your enemy . 
   they ca n't even decisively win against an unstable ukraine . 
  are you kidding ? 
  that was a few ex army and part timers . 
  it was nothing like the full weight of the russian military . 
  thank you , sensei for your wisdom . 
  fuck that would be terrifying for a nation that was dependant on oil . 
  just saying . 
  hypothetically , like . 
  yeah , reminded me of [ this ] ( http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/funny-gif-dogs-fighting-internet-reality1.gif ), 
  do n't sugar coat it , just tell us straight how you really feel . 
  if you 're tempted to feel a bit of schadenfreude about this , then do n't . 
  as russia becomes more isolated , and it 's economy crumbles , it will become more and more dangerous . 
  i 'm not offended at all , and i guess it depends on exactly what you mean by total surveillance . 
  in the case of anpr ( automatic number plate recognition ) each town perimeter and many main roads and motorways througout the uk have these . 
  they record every number plate and presumably the time and date they see . 
  this data has been extremely useful to the police , not only in catching criminals , but also to contribute to the evidence of someone 's case who is innocent . 
  the access to the data is strictly limited , and the police need to justify each and every data request . 
  it 's difficult to see a down side really , and i certainly would n't consider this ` total surveillance ' [ here 's ] ( http://www.police.uk/information-and-advice/automatic-number-plate-recognition/#access-to-stored-data ) some more info about this from the british police . 
  shush , 
  no one said anything about total surveillance . 
  why is it impossible to discuss something without someone else taking what you 're talking about to some ridiculous extreme ? 
  i ca n't understand a word , but i 'm guessing by the look of it that this is some more ridiculous russian propaganda, 
   the case of the `` autobahn sniper '' baffled police until last year , when they placed number-plate scanners along the highway and compared all vehicles that passed with the times of the shootings . 
  the uk has these scanners everywhere . 
  we 'd have caught him much earlier . 
  a lot of people object to this kind of surveillance , but there are advantages . 
  i 'm guessing that 's for the severn bridge ? 
  wow that 's expensive . 
  what about this freedom of movement everyone 's banging on about ? 
  it 's all about the timing , 
  do n't be a tw . . oh never mind .
