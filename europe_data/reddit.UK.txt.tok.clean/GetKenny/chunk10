  why ? 
  and what would a halibut know about any of that ? 
  the us is spending a ridiculous amount on defence . 
  [ something like 39 % of the world 's total expenditure .

  these are hard times , which might contribute to the hard tone , but i know what you mean our government always seems to be on the back foot ( defensive ) with europe . 
  i 'm not sure we are arguing for a weaker europe as such , just one based more around a trading block rather than one which is heading inexorably towards federalisation . 
  we are not alone in many of our attitudes towards europe , we 're just the most vocal . 
  you 're very aggresive . 
  you might think that , i could n't possibly comment . 
  `` week 14 . 
  dearest glorious ritzy leader , am fitting in like normal reddit person , they truly believe i am one of them . 
  they keep talking about cats . 
  i do n't understand this , it might be special secret code for anti - russian speaking . 
  will continue monitoring of situation . 
  ps am learning to ` troll ' lol '' . 
  honestly , no one here knows , unless putin and other world leaders happen to be lurking . 
  ... guys ? 
  ignoring the facetiousness , i totally agree , the uk spends too much as well imo . 
  edit : oh sorry , did you want a uk vs usa bitching session ? 
  take [ that ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xudapnxc_68 ), 
  the amount the usa spends on defence ? 
  [ yes , i know .

   the uk seems to be attempting to weaken the eu by luring member states into their domestic political debates .

  is she / germany in a position to make these offers ? 
  what does the rest of the eu think about this ?

  if this is true , and they really are fishing too much mackerel , then it 's a pity . 
  up to now the icelanders , together with the norwegians have been a model of how to fish sustainably . 
  maybe there is more to it ? 
  this is not from a confirmed source , and there 's no need to sensationalise with even more what you call ` bullshit ' . 
  i suppose it 's something you either get or you do n't . 
  this title should read :  leaked files suggest yanukovych had plan for harsh clampdown . 
  no need to editorialise , this is chilling enough . 
  thanks for the link . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.blue-marble.de/nightlights/2012 ) is probably the best info i can find . 
  i wish there were places i could go to near to home that were free of light pollution . 
  looking up at the sky from such a place at the right time is truly an awe inspiring experience . 
  it is now . 
  good . 
  this has gone on for far too long .

  we crash our cars very rarely , but that 's not a good reason to not wear a seat belt, 
  i meant the cossacks , i did n't see anyone else in uniform and with weapons , did you ? 
  what were they doing there in uniform and with weapons ? 
  laughter can be a force for positive change , 
  if they are trying to maintain a good image in front of the world they are failing miserably . 
  whipping and beating up girls and now this . 
  it seems there is some confusion about the difference between what the court calls a ` clean bill of health ' and signing off . 
  it is still true to say that the accounts have not been signed off as correct by all member nations for 19 years straight now . 
   british claws i get the feeling you 're not approaching this from a neutral standpoint . 
  if you 've done any reading you already know the answers to these questions , i think you 're just trying to get some kind of reaction . 
  we call it `` shit stirring '', 
  calling a whole nation cunts is funny ? 
  very old chestnut . 
   the eu 's auditors last year refused to give the accounts a clean bill of health for the 19th year in succession .

  try it on toast with peanut butter . 
  sorry , i do n't get it . 
  explain please ? 
  there 's nothing new here , same rhetoric about bullying from westminster and `` attempts to dictate from on high '' . 
   `` to be told there are things we ca n't do will certainly elicit a scottish response that is as resolute as it is uncomfortable to the ` no ' campaign , '' said the scottish first minister . 
   `` it is , ` yes we can ' . 
  it is a sign of just how out of touch and arrogant the westminster establishment has become . '', 
  this is not helping his cause at all . 
  he needs to come up with some other possible alternative or his campaign will be reduced to just shouting denials and insults back at westminster . 
  the debate deserves better than this , as do the scottish people . 
  uk politics ? 
  this is very wrong . 
  if you want to be respectful you should address someone as their self identified gender . 
  in this case ` she ' . 
  wherever did you get the idea of calling a human being an ` it ' ? 
  what did you dream ? 
  it 's alright we told you what to dream . 
  what did she expect ? 
  thanks that sounds about right . 
  what 's annoying me is there seems to be some conflation going on here from spain vis a vis scotland and catalonia . 
  it 's like they are saying this about scotland - with this thinly veiled threat of possibly not accepting a theoretical scottish application to join the eu - using it as a threat to catalonia , instead of looking at the scottish situation as something different and seperate , which it is . 
  false dilemma . 
   the eu 's ruling elites in brussels this kind of sets the tone for this article . 
  is it me or are there a lot of really biased / crap articles coming from the states being linked here lately ? 
  barroso has said something similar about catalonia . 
  at this point , it 's hard to separate scotland and catalonia in terms their potentially joining the eu because of a wish by some politicians to make the two equivalent . 
  are they ? 
  or is this just scaremongering by politicians that do n't want one or the other , or either of these to secede ? 
  what happened to all that ` mutual trust ' etc. 
  hollande was talking about with obama ? 
  does someone need a nap ? 
  you 've got to love the daily mail .
