  [ and tanks ?

   there 's no need for a whole petulant nation to do it . 
  we love you too . 
  why afraid ? 
  do n't be afraid . 
  [ eton mess ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/eton_mess ) easy , delicious and very english , 
   the draft text of the legislation says at least two incidents of violence , threats or action that causes someone to fear for their safety would amount to a `` course of conduct '' which would allow police to bring criminal charges . 
   critically , its definition of abuse includes `` controlling or coercive behaviour '' which would `` encompass but is not limited to physical , financial , sexual , psychological or emotional abuse '' . 
   `` controlling behaviour '' would also lead to criminal charges , including when a partner makes another person `` subordinate '' , `` exploits their resources '' or `` deprives them of the means needed for independence '' . 
  i 'd say that was ` open to interpretation ' at the very least . 
  would n't you ? 
  good man . 
  i think there are a few politicians on both sides of the atlantic that see the eu as a rival to the usa , but i do n't think this view is shared by much of the eu 's populace . 
  aaaaaaaand it was all down to the feckin english , the feckin english , the feckin english ... 
   i have noticed that people on this sub-reddit have somewhat given up the pride in their nationality ( not fully , of course ) for pride in the eu . 
  i do n't think so , what you say may apply to some other countries , i do n't know , but there is very little of this here in the uk afaik . 
  using ukraine as an example is not representative at all . 
  would n't it be better if the states where they currently live treated them better ? 
  so it was n't 150kg then ? 
  this could be the title of a sad irish folk song . 
  the japanese wo n't like it . 
   you ca n't just annex a sovereign country without some kind of democratic process in both countries . 
  you can if you have a [ flag ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utduy7qkvk8 ), 
  another poorly defined law potentially criminalising a wide range of behaviours depending on how it is interpreted . 
  also :  the measure would increase victim confidence to report the crime , lead to more thorough investigations and convictions , and help keep women safe . 
  the title is not exactly like the bbc 's , and the quotes have been added by op . 
  it would be interesting to find out how many eu countries secretly have the same attitude as the uk to federalisation , but are happy for us to be the most vocal about it . 
  the irony , 
   well why are they starting to fight it in 2014 when it 's been in place for over 20yrs ? 
  i think the reason for this is the fact that cameron decided to make an issue out of it , and incorporated it into the tory publicity machine . 
  so it now has a cameron , and therefore governmental tag on it . 
  reddit and anyone else anti government : `` conspiracy ! '' . 
  and so , bring on the clowns ... 
  as we all do . 
  also muslims -  terrorists etc. 
   protect the kids and all that nonsense - boring , must be false  he 's some sort of an evil supervillain - that 's it !, 
  plus conspiracy = reddit nirvana !, 
  an opinion piece from 2009 ? 
  please . 
  tell me more about this ` culture ', 
  seconded . 
  then how would i report the hate crimes ? 
  ^ wait ... 
   `` the conflict has , for many , been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as oh !, 
  what a lovely war , the monocled mutineer and blackadder as a misbegotten shambles -- a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite . '', 
  welcome to british politics . 
  `` swastika scrawled on reddit sub '', 
  this reads like it was written by a ten year old . 
  i did n't hint at anything different . 
  why are you telling me this ? 
  i sincerely doubt that any significant arms deal happening anywhere in the world is completely free of graft . 
  instances like this are down to either they got caught , or something else is going on and this is an excuse to get out of it . 
  yes , it 's true . 
  it 's also true that murderers are worse than roma beggars . 
  i really do n't see his point , it 's not like we can only be concerned about one thing at a time is it ? 
  edit : a word . 
  predicting the future has always been a challenge . 
  i think you 're getting very confused . 
  you 're confusing assumption and ` adequate explanation ', 
  it 's been attributed to other people as well , that 's why i did n't quote the source . 
  * evil relies on people being paranoid enough to believe the opposite of this . 
  the map could do with a legend and some annotation . 
  the ` rule ' is designed to prevent the erroneous assumption of bad intentions . 
  particularly important in the first two you mentioned . 
  your interpretation is potentially dangerous . 
  welcome latvia !, 
  wherever you are ... 
  sorry it 's really hard to tell sometimes , 
  `` never ascribe to malice that which can adequately be explained by incompetence . '', 
  just because it calls itself the ` european view on american foreign policy ' it does n't mean that it is the european view on american foreign policy . 
  how gullible can you be ? 
  i mean come on , most of us have n't even heard of this guy . 
  we should just downvote this bollocks and move on . 
  apparently the explosives were part of some security device attached to the safe . 
  but ...  some safes can be fitted with small charges to destroy secret documents in the event of the lock being tampered with . 
  however , the czech police appeared to leave open the possibility that the diplomatic mission might have been storing explosives . 
  wtf ? 
  i thought that said scum for a moment . 
  [ walking in a loud shirt in a built up area during the hours of darkness ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo8epfycg2y ), 
  what a crock . 
  i think you 're confusing the roi with the uk . 
   uk , you are way too whiny . 
  get that checked so we are all the same ? 
  and speak with one voice ? 
  as indicated by the voting , made_in_england 's view is not typical here . 
  do n't start shouting at us just because some of our press is crap . 
  roast beef , roast potatoes , cauliflower cheese , carrots , peas , yorkshire puds . 
  do n't even get me started on the trainspotters ... 
  problematic for who ? 
  just a poor attempt at humour . 
  that was from an advert put out by the romanian media btw , nothing to do with the uk media . 
  i expect we could both present pictures of any country in the world to make the natives look beautiful/ugly , stupid/smart , rich/poor etc etc. 
  and call it ` typical ' . 
  the truth is people just are n't that homogeneous , even from within their own country . 
  i believed it because i 've seen worse . 
  get off your fucking high horse . 
  damn . 
  ca n't trust anything on the internet ,
