  wait a minute - [ something 's not quite right ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/kate-middleton-gandul-romanian-newspaper-1569564 ), 
   if they joined us yeeeaaaa that 's not going to happen . 
  indians do n't hate the british . 
  what did we do to pakistan ? 
  you said hydrochloric acid , and said it was harmless , and took the piss , but you linked gastric acid , of which a mild concentration of the potentially deadly hydrochloric acid is a component . 
  [ actually i think you mean this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hydrochloric_acid ) but , you know , why have facts when you can just make stuff up ? 
  it must be quite taxing to keep that lot going . 
  [ cheers !, 
  details [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22263020 ), 
  do n't start . 
  remember boston . 
  possible :  in june , doku umarov , one of the leaders of the islamist insurgency in the russian caucasus republics , called on his supporters to use `` maximum force '' to disrupt the `` satanic '' winter olympics in sochi . 
   it is too early to say whether the attack in volgograd was by one of his supporters . 
  yes , the sun as well . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd want to be fair to someone who is prepared to do this . 
  they could not guarantee there was no danger - it would have been pointless from their point of view without some real danger . 
  it 's a bit like saying the ira were ok lads because they phoned in warnings when they planted a bomb . 
  it 's a great shame the daily mail etc. 
  have chosen to portray us as xenophobes , souring relations with bulgaria and romania in particular . 
  i hope the bulgarians and romanians who want to come over and behave like normal human beings ( the majority i 'm sure ) can see this . 
  it 's the same thought process as taxing the roads , if i 'm understanding it properly . 
  ps :  google is a particular target for france , earning $ 2 billion a year in the country while paying little to no domestic tax , a situation president hollande has called `` unacceptable . '', 
  sounds familiar . 
  yes , the wording of the question is crucial to the results here . 
  taking an unrelated trait and applying it in error to every member of a group is one definition of stereotyping , the root of racism , sexism etc. 
  see how you quickly get to `` they '' for `` euro sceptic '' and try to give `` them '' all the same attributes , and then abuse `` them '' . 
  poison random strangers to punish big corporations ? 
  phobic would imply an ** irrational ** fear . 
  that would be difficult from within the constraints of european and global trading rules . 
  for example : the uk used to prefer buying bananas from the windward isles as a form of aid , but we had to stop .

  connecting the two is a real stretch , but this did genuinely shock me :  [ draconian feminism ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfq3ppyecdc&amp;lc=ktmc2az0ykypqr0an09-yp6rt7uetphhv-edmth8kl4 ), 
  he who pays the piper ... 
  is that being blocked ? 
  i told you not to put them in charge of the supplies . 
   france treachery !, 
  you obviously hate the uk if you 're prepared to make up and/or believe this tripe . 
  people want to be outraged . 
  all comments like this telling the truth of what 's really happening ( nothing really ) are being buried by hysterical posts comparing the uk to china . 
  it 's the same in worldnews , unitedkingdom etc. 
  haha you 're funny , 
  elf power ftw !, 
   if it turns out that the person in question abuses the system , the belgian state can ask them to leave the country . 
   it 's mostly immigrants from romania who are asked to leave the country . 
  david cameron will be delighted to hear this . 
  [ help !, 
  it would n't be so bad if it was mutual to both countries , but often it is n't . 
  i think it 's a strange masochistic kind of arrogance that leads us in the west to think that all of africa 's problems are because of us . 
  as if we had the power to shape the way they think and behave permanently because of the years of colonisation . 
  [ flags are key to that sort of thing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utduy7qkvk8 ),

  and flags . 
  there should be flags . 
  if true , i wonder what the federalists ' take on this is ? 
  the article itself answers the question :  without a common foreign policy , it is indeed difficult for the eu to arrive at the 28-member consensus needed for a deployment of its troops -- especially since the regulations stipulate that the two or three countries assuming the rotating leadership of the battle groups finance the operation almost exclusively . 
  very probably not . 
  we 've been promised a vote on it after the next elections in 2015 if the conservatives are kept in . 
  talk of an exit is much more newsworthy than talk of keeping the status quo , and so is over-reported in the media . 
  or just let them march through . 
  nothing puts you under someone else 's control quite like owing them money and having to depend on their good will . 
  i do n't know this source but it 's translated from russian so i 'm guessing there is some bias . 
  maybe i 'm wrong but it seems to me there is something very democratic about a large crowd destroying a public symbol of oppression . 
  welcome to the thunderdome . 
  i suppose it depends what you think is ` clean ' i for one like seeing the maps and data charts here . 
  it 's a general comment about the economist , not about the military or anything else in particular . 
  it 's as if a new younger editor has taken over and said `` right we need new punchy hard hitting headlines , more controversy and drama '' . 
  the economist has , while i was n't looking , become a bit crap . 
  what 's going on with it ? 
  if you do n't like it just downvote and move on . 
  the economist is not what it used to be . 
  he looks like a contender for the upper class twit of the year award . 
  just for a moment i read `` russia cuts ukraine gas '' and thought holy shit . 
  phil , go home ... 
  all watched over by machines . 
  for balance , most of us brits know that certain news outlets should be viewed with suspicion , and most of us are n't being fooled by this disgusting right wing filth that is being pushed at us . 
  while this is true , they 've never been used as a military force . 
  the only thing i can see them being used for is humanitarian missions , where it 's a lot easier to find agreement on it 's use , or if a member state was under direct attack from outside the eu . 
  the reason why this wo n't work is the same reason why the eu does n't have a common defence force : we rarely if ever agree on what should be done in terms of military action , nothing would ever get done . 
  shush they 're really sensitive about it . 
  edit : they also prefer being called ` scotch ' . 
  you 're welcome .

  i 'm betting a # 39 is never a whole peking duck with pancakes .

  do you have a moment to talk about freedom ? '', 
   australia 's delegates have been accused of particularly boorish behavior during the warsaw talks . 
  `` they wore t-shirts and gorged on snacks throughout the negotiation , '' a climate action network spokesperson complained to the guardian . 
  sorry this made me laugh . 
  shush ... we might lose our status as chief scapegoat .
