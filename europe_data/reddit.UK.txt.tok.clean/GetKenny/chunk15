  interesting raw figures . 
  [ met police report ] ( http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/disclosure_2013/feb_2013/2013010000160.pdf ) ** warning : pdf **, 
  true , but one would assume the eu diplomat knows something about what he 's saying . 
  i think this could become quite a tussle between the uk government and brussels . 
  it might get interesting . 
  no , you just ignored my ` what if ' . 
   also , if you 're not able to work in the uk , why would you move to the uk ? 
  i think it is great that so many eu nationals move to the uk to work and most do n't have difficulty working here . 
  but moving to the uk to take advantage of uk benefits ? 
  really ? 
  why are you asking me this ? 
  why do n't you address my initial post ? 
  and if they ca n't get work because they do n't speak the language ? 
  ids is just making noises . 
  he ca n't back any of this up because of eu law . 
  so that 's twice ? 
  so , what is ids going to do with the immigrants that fail whatever test is thrown at them ? 
  deport them , or let them starve , or push them into the black economy ? 
   an eu diplomat said mr duncan smith would need some `` good lawyers '' . 
  the diplomat said : `` it seems the government wants to step up the fight . 
  i hope mr duncan smith has good lawyers or britain could be paying some big fines . 
   `` discriminating against people on the basis of language would be illegal . 
  no comment . 
  i 'll forward the email with the link . 
  yes , problem . 
   `` the kikes , damn kikes , holy god would not leave the kike alive , neither in heaven nor on earth , only in the chimney as smoke , this is what the kike is good for , to make kike smoke through the chimney on the street . ''  in a statement tuesday , tvr3 said it did not select the carol but only broadcast songs that were chosen and compiled by the center for preservation and promotion of traditional culture , which belongs to the eastern county of cluj . 
  unbelievable . 
  how much ? 
  much hack so lure, 
   77 % nonsense . 
  i 'd say 76 % at most . 
  uk : russian government , go fuck yourself . 
  i thought this was about trade , not aid . 
  how do you know ? 
   alan douglas , an unemployed electrician living near dublin , was encouraged to move to coventry , uk . 
  they ** literally ** wanted to send him to coventry . 
  those bastards . 
  he was doing great until right at the end . 
  i feel he lost it a bit there . 
  this is very sad . 
  those who convinced him to do this should feel deep shame . 
  that 's good , and everything - but what makes them think we 're any better ? 
  me too !, 
  haha . 
  i was thinking more in terms of their depiction of a fight over ukraine , with ukraine as the helpless maiden , having no control over it 's destiny while germany and russia fight over her . 
  i find this narrative from spiegel quite bizarre . 
  with china in charge of the supplies ? 
  as far as i can see , and this is n't being discussed from the conversations happening here on reddit ( please correct me if i 'm wrong ) , is that some of the stuff in the leaked ` snowden ' data is of genuine public interest , and some of it really should be kept secret because of the safety of field operatives for example . 
  i think the real problem is that the people who should be the keepers of this data can not be trusted to behave in the public interest . 
  and partly as a consequence of this , and partly as a consequence of being careless with the data , they have lost control of it . 
  looks like russia is goose-stepping back to the good old days . 
  it 's just that , when i hear words like retarded , moronic , idiotic being applied to the bbc it kind of makes me a bit suspicious . 
  because the bbc is one of the , if not the most respected and reliable news gathering agencies in the world . 
  i think you have a logic/grammar problem . 
  read the conversation i had with modomario . 
  i watched the video and i still ca n't see or hear any reference to a ` country divided ' . 
  care to point me to the part of the video that does ? 
  edit : i heard it in the other video to the right . 
  `` deeply divided with russian historical influence still strong in the east '' . 
  now please explain to me why this is such an idiotic , moronic , retarded thing to say . 
  yeah , stop being so bloody successful . 
  you seem to think that calling gravity a fact , and saying that the eu has an image problem is a fact are the same . 
  again , it 's facts and opinions . 
  you really are having a problem with this . 
  also , you 're still assuming things that you should n't . 
   the only discussion this is about it is if the question is loaded question . 
  your ability to see that this question is indeed , loaded hangs on your ability to separate an opinion from a fact . 
  something you do n't seem able to do . 
  so far , 11 people have seen my original post and agreed that it is a loaded question . 
  so where is your assertion that ` everyone agrees ' ? 
  i 'm not implying anything . 
  all i 'm saying to this chap is that the question was a loaded one , and he just does n't seem able to let it go . 
  copy and pasting from dictionary.com is not a very impressive form of argument , especially when you have misconstrued the use to which i was putting the phrase . 
  it is true , as you copied from the website , that the phrase i used is a rhetorical question , but it also happens to be a loaded question . 
  the two are not the same , you should have found somewhere to copy from that referred to it as a loaded question . 
   so now i leave it to you to tell me why the eu may not have an image problem and why that could be debatable because you 're the only entity in this entire thread that denies that and polls support it . 
  again you are very confused as to what is , and what is not a fact , and you are also confused as to what i have and have not said . 
  you are trying to put words into my mouth , and you are trying to turn an opinion into a fact . 
  it does n't matter how many to times you make the assertion to the contrary , the question was a loaded one . 
  i started by saying it 's a loaded question . 
  that is all . 
  you seem to be having a problem with understanding what a loaded question is , and why it might be a bad thing when trying to start a debate . 
  the rest is just projection from you . 
   no i 'm not saying that . 
  i 'm saying that a question is not loaded when there is nothing controversial or unjustified about it . 
   an example would be when i ask `` why is the moon mostly round '' . 
   i think it 's pretty much a fact that the eu has a recent image problem . 
  that 's a fact ? 
  we 're going round in circles now . 
  you 're confusing facts and opinions . 
   a loaded question would be a question which contains a controversial or unjustified assumption . 
  controversial to who ? 
  an unjustified assumption according to who ? 
  are you saying that the fact of whether or not a question is loaded is variable , determined differently according to who is listening ? 
  is it assumed that all redditors on this sub have the same opinions and assumptions ? 
  it 's like you 're deliberately missing the point . 
  say it is n't so . 
   so it 's not really like the wife-beating analogy imo . 
  i 'm not sure you understand what i 'm saying , because you are confusing the term analogy with example . 
  i 'm not being aggressive at all .
