  it means cameron was urged - he did n't do any urging himself . 
   gazprom makes much of its reliability in never having broken a contract with the eu . 
  lets see how long this amazing record lasts . 
  but how then will they do the old expenses switcheroony - travelling 2nd class while claiming 1st ? 
  the translation seems fine . 
  what i mean is the video itself does n't really show clearly what is going on . 
  it 's impossible to tell what 's going on here from the video . 
  good . 
  about time too . 
  ok ... errr ... ` run for the hills ? ', 
  so , business as usual !, 
  they 've been with us for decades now , no problems . 
  racism is only ever borne of ignorance , and you are so , very , ignorant . 
  yes , i forgot about the xenophobia . 
   our intuition tells us that the circumcision of baby boys is probably okay , at worst harmless and culturally very important to some religions who 's intuition are they talking about ? 
  not mine . 
  my intuition tells me that if boys were given the choice - i.e. 
  the parents waited until they were old enough to make the decision for themselves - very few would have it done . 
  [ the buccaneers were pirates who attacked spanish shipping in the caribbean sea during the 17th century . 
  right back at ya , [ homophobes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homophobia ), 
  as far as tactics go in the uk , i ca n't think of many better ways of making us all hate the muslim brotherhood . 
  this is n't over yet ... 
   let 's say ireland controlled a small chunk a ( sic ) england that 's the thing - it 's not a small chunk of spain . 
  it 's the same as having a shared border with a neighbouring country . 
  based on 2 articles , a year apart ? 
  is this supposed to be enough to represent `` the british ` commentariat ' '' ? 
  ( whatever that 's supposed to be ) . 
  because they were thinking of our freedom when they marched across europe , with no intention of leaving ? 
  all hail our generous saviours !, 
  russia - gangsterism on an international scale . 
   queen victoria was pissed by this deal you 're not really a brit , are you ? 
  the title is a tad misleading :  revealing just one of the nine arrested men is british , he confirmed detectives are not treating the attack as racially-motivated . 
  it 's just a cultural thing . 
  while we have lots in common with you guys from over the pond , i 'm sure there 's plenty of good stuff in the usa that we do n't get . 
  he could n't be arsed to claim him back .

  putin is trying to return just a bit of dignity back to the people . '',

  satire ? 
  nonsense !, 
  eurovision is a very very serious business . 
  try taking a happy pill . 
  you always have to watch out for the quiet ones . 
  i agree . 
  it 's interesting stuff , but there 's very little point in the comparison . 
  for the time being , it seems integration is going too fast . 
  we have seen what happens when you try to force it , we 're just not ready yet .

  we can hate ourselves as much as the next man . 
  do n't worry about internet points , in this case its just shorthand for : `` it 's ok . you 're ashamed so many greeks voted for them , and you 're making excuses , i understand , but you 're deliberately ignoring the whole point , which is comparing golden dawn to ukip and saying they are equivalent is ridiculous .

  you 're saying they are for gay marriage ?

  tell me more about what is ` natural ' and what is not . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  i would end by stressing you can not compare golden dawn to ukip , they are not in the same ball park . 
  i appreciate it 's very hard to look at another country 's voting habits and make sense of it as an outsider . 
  having said this , golden dawn are hovering around the 6 % -7 % mark of total votes in greece [ source ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/18/greece-far-right-golden-dawn ) . 
  the nearest thing we have to them in the uk is the bnp , who have now almost totally collapsed and even at their height of popularity only got about 2 % of the vote [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_national_party_election_results ) i ca n't help but think there is something else going on rather than just a protest vote . 
  why ruin a perfectly good anglo/french punchup ?

  it 's very hard to understand how these people get votes . 
  daww it 's just some young french scamps having a bit of a lark . 
  ruffle their hair and send them on their way . 
  how dare you say that , we love you . 
  it 's a classic tactic for a politician when having waning popularity at home to divert attention away from domestic problems and incite some good old xenophobia . 
  why not an amusing massive wanker ? 
  it 's been widely reported as true , stephen fry used it on qi so it must be  try [ here ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/talk:winston_churchill ) , ctrl + f `` makes you proud '', 
  an aide brought churchill the morning paper with the news that one of his cabinet ministers would have to resign because he had been caught having gay sex with a grenadier guardsman in green park the night before . 
  mr churchill ruminated for a moment , and then asked whether he was right in thinking that it had been particularly cold the previous night . 
  the aide shakily confirmed that it had been one of the coldest february nights on record . 
  before turning over and going back to sleep , the prime minister exclaimed , `` makes you proud to be british ! '', 
  i love your optimism . 
  do n't be british . 
  on reflection , you may have a point . 
  there 's no way of checking up on the figures given by the site . 
  it 's called political satire . 
  how so ? 
  we are federation . 
  you will be assimilated . 
  resistance is futile . 
  apparently good government correlates exactly with good football . 
  so what ? 
  what context would that be ? 
   `` qualitatively , abortion is much more serious than the rape of children by priests . '', 
  he should have quit while he was ahead, 
  whenever i 'm feeling hard done by , i remember this : `` remember that you are an englishman , and have consequently won first prize in the lottery of life . '', 
  this is like recursive xenophobia .
