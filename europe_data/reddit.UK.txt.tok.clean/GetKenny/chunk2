  how about putin on the ritz ? 
  with frickin ' lazors !, 
  wow , uk is first . 
  that 's good , right ? 
  point taken , but the vast majority are fatherless . 
  not having enough time is a direct cause of being a single parent , and so , in many cases is not having much money . 
  this means that the single part is a direct cause , according to your own statement . 
  i think most people would agree that , although a single mum can do a fantastic job of raising children alone , it is a lot easier to do from within a functioning family , and statistically outcomes for the children are better :  commenting on the findings , harry benson , research director for the marriage foundation , said : `` these figures are alarming . 
  evidence clearly shows the negative impact of being brought up in single parent homes . 
  these children are less likely to attain qualifications , more prone to experience unemployment and are more likely to commit crime . 
  being brought up in a stable two-parent household is essential in affording children the decent start in life they deserve . 
  this is sad . 
  a kid needs a father . 
  but how do you fix this ? 
  is it ? 
  how can you add to the conversation with an irrelevant question ? 
  you are literally a pie chart . 
  no one ever just asks a question . 
  irrelevant . 
  just putin on the ritz . 
  this on the first page ( my emphasis )  4 . 
  ** to condemn the is ** and support the kurdish forces fighting against it , while expressing no confidence or trust in the us military intervention . 
  encourage students to boycott anyone found to be funding the is or supplying them with goods , training , travel or soldiers . 
  so , the info you gave me proves the title of your post says the opposite of the truth . 
  did you read this before posting it ? 
  can * you ? 
   this is drummed up to the point where sense of proportion is getting lost . 
  greetings , and welcome to reddit . 
  it seems op did n't read the article * sigh *, 
  you 're right . 
  every year , the bonfire gets lit early by vandals . 
  every year . 
  this is news ? 
  anjem choudary is the ian paisley of the islam world . 
  careful now . 
  yes but this is russia . 
  they must be commanded . 
  why is it that any portrayal of the irish by the yanks always ends up looking like some stereotyped , corny cartoon ? 
  she 'll be `` married '' and banged up before you can say ` rock the kasbah ' . 
   and faggots all day i see you 're becoming linguistically as well as culturally acclimatised , 
  so the euro is solely responsible for this ? 
  nuclear energy is much misunderstood . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxj-rm-yo7k ) is one of their videos . 
  the best way to make friends with an irishman is to say you thought he was english . 
  yeah baby - [ groovy version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjk3eup5hvg ), 
  and slowly and surely drew their plans against us . 
  no , this is a constant source of entertainment . 
  it all depends on whether you think that ` the british isles ' is geographical or political . 
  only the irish worry about it really . 
  it 's very sad though , really . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/02/article-2714272-20351bb800000578-619_634x388.jpg ) one at the royal free hospital in london . 
  have you any idea what has been happening in europe the last 80 years ? 
  relying on russia is such a bad idea . 
  at this point i 'm going to say stop feeding it . 
  all just puppets of the evil geniuses at westminster . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/marshall_01.shtml ) might interest you . 
  i 'm a brit and it surprised me . 
  it 's not something we hear about very much , we in the uk normally only think of the marshall plan as it applies to germany . 
  yes . 
  the war changed many things in british society . 
  i saw a mouse !,

  this happens in france and italy as well , it is barbaric and should be stopped . 
  i do n't understand much about world economics at all , but the amount of qe the usa is doing makes me feel anxious whenever i think about it ( not all that often tbh ) . 
  is n't it a bit like living on fairy cakes conjured using the glitter extracted from unicorn poo ? 
  i think what he means is that when the boundaries are blurred , i.e. 
  there is no clear , set hours to work as a minimum , then a lot of people overcompensate by working more hours , to feel safe from criticism . 
  it 's very situational . 
  i can imagine this working well in some jobs where there is a clearly defined amount of work to be done , and not so well in others . 
  i said no such thing , the research was on brain development and age . 
  the link i gave does indeed support what i am saying . 
  rolling up your feelings into one or two carefully chosen words is sometimes the best way to communicate . 
  succinct and to the point . 
  ` immature mind ? ', 
  is that not a personal attack ? 
  now you 're just lying . 
  i 've made nothing up , read the rest of the thread and then just [ fuck off ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/88629-jim-carrey-laughing-gif-liar-l-gtdr.gif ) . 
  look elsewhere in this thread , i linked it . 
  also look it up for yourself , it 's not good to rely on people spoon feeding you information . 
  i fabricated nothing . 
  do n't hold your breath . 
  and you have nothing . 
  just an opinion . 
  so we should increase it to 21 . 
  job done . 
  i 'd say that showing their brains are n't mature yet is pretty good evidence . 
  what research shows they should be given the vote ? 
  an opinion backed up by research . 
  it 's not just like a 19 year old 's brain . 
  [ do some reading . 
  ] ( http://www.allstate.com/resources/allstate/attachments/about/brain-ad.pdf ) ( pdf ), 
  no problem at all , they simply are n't old enough . 
  i 've already linked you a study showing that 16 year old brains are n't good at making rational decisions . 
  to be clear there 's no fear . 
  ` oh please ' yourself . 
  there is a wealth of research to prove it . 
  it 's not arbitrary at all to filter out those with undeveloped minds , and we 've been doing it for a long time with good reason . 
  same reason though . 
  a 16 year old brain has not finished developing yet .
