  it 's not who , it 's which culture . 
  a lot of brits feel exactly the same . 
  i think expecting greece , for example , to suddenly behave just like germany , for example , is just ridiculous . 
  the cultures are completely different . 
  that 's not a value judgement where one is ` better ' , they 're just different , they do things differently . 
  i think this is the cause of a lot of bad feeling and illustrates what you say when we are too different . 
  so let 's ease off the speed on the federal engine , reduce the size of the eurozone to the countries that can actually harmonise fiscally with each other , and also ease off on some of the bureaucracy . 
  let 's have a good look at what works in terms of trading standards and common laws etc and what does n't , and act accordingly . 
  i 'm not trying to sell anything to anyone , least of all germany . 
  brits only ever voted for an economic bloc , and as things are , depending on what poll you look at , over half of us right now are keen to get out altogether . 
   its in essence just a trade union . 
  i think this is what it should be , according to some of us . 
  in america . 
  i think you 're obsessing about google and missing the point . 
  facebook bought whatsapp . 
  japan 's rakuten bought viber for $ 900 million . 
  yes i did , pudding , yes i did . 
  google alone employs more than 50,000 people . 
  it dodges taxes , but it still contributes to economies . 
   meanwhile for jews like me , there 's a sense of something sinister in the air . 
  i 'd even go so far as to say that the atmosphere could be likened to how the jews of germany felt in the early 1930s . 
  what a dick . 
  [ it 's not hard to look it up ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=scotland+opinion+poll+trident ), 
  just under half of them *, 
   i think it is a bit easy to say they should have stayed and fought . 
  yes , good point . 
  you have no evidence for this . 
  on the contrary , the ones fleeing and their families are more likely to be on the other side . 
  they will be , eventually . 
  i think it 's confirmation bias . 
  a lot of us expect everyone from that part of the world to be a religious fanatic , and so that 's how this kind of speech is interpreted . 
  we say things like ` jesus christ ' , and ` oh god ' all the time , and we do n't mean it in a religious way , it 's just a manner of speaking . 
  maybe religion is more ingrained in their society , but that does n't mean they mean everything literally . 
  jihad , allah , this is just a manner of speaking . 
  you should try to look past this and see the true meaning of what they 're saying . 
  in other words they are saying those men leaving should have stayed to protect their families and fight for their land . 
   it 's hard not to i know you find it hard . 
  arrogance is thinking you can take an unlimited amount of refugees , encouraging more and more while sneering at your neighbours ' ` lack of empathy ' and then realising you are being overwhelmed and having to shut the borders in a panic , while still more refugees try to come to your country only to be bitterly disappointed . 
  not unless they share germany 's human values , according to gabriel . 
   `` europe is a community of values based on human sympathy and solidarity . 
  and those that do n't share our values ca n't count on our money over time , '' said gabriel . 
  arrogant bastard . 
  i do n't see why this would mean the end of schengen , i thought this was about the eu 's external border , not internal . 
  if you frown and shout and put on a rough voice in any other language , and smile and speak softly in your own , even klingon would sound friendly by comparison . 
  bullying using economic threats for non compliance with what germany wants . 
  is this a taste of things to come for the future of europe ? 
  this is not entertainment . 
  or good in any sense . 
   last year , britain gave $ 19.4 billion , making it the second largest aid donor in the world , after the us . 
   the uk is one of only five member states to have met the un target of 0.7 % for oda . 
   the others are denmark ( 0.85 % ) , norway ( 0.99 % ) , luxembourg ( 1.07 % ) , and sweden ( 1.10 ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/uk-europe/britain-europes-top-overseas-aid-donor-313617 )  the uk has already given more than # 920million to the ( syrian refugee ) humanitarian effort - more than germany , netherlands , france , italy , hungary , austria and poland combined . 
  [ source ( yuk , but still relevant ) ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3222250/how-britain-given-aid-refugees-germany-netherlands-france-italy-hungary-austria-poland-combined.html ), 
  i think you should draw a distinction between the ordinary people there and the rulers . 
  you 're talking about facts and logic . 
  when predicting the behaviour of people en masse , that 's not a good starting point , sadly . 
  defiantly indeed . 
  that feeling would be wrong . 
  the whole special relationship thing has been exposed as a lie , and we just are n't feeling it any more . 
  you should thank us . 
  and i like the way some people here talk on behalf of the peoples of the european union , 
  it 's like a little third world island . 
  you 're *, 
  careful now . 
  you win the prize for the most ill-informed comment of the day !, 
  in their place , i would n't answer that question honestly either . 
  it 's a bit naive to expect them to say `` the income is a big factor '' . 
  a lot of us in the uk feel bad as well . 
  great . 
  now i have [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/mqh3ntuclz4?t=34 ) in my head . 
   first of all the term `` safe countries '' is absolute bullshit . 
  why ? 
   i also guess you 're referring to the term `` economic refugees '' here . 
  yes , obviously . 
  someone who has fled from a country , arrived in another country where the danger no longer exists , and is then making a choice as to which country they want to settle in based on what they think life will be like there is no longer fleeing persecution and danger , but choosing what they think is best for themselves and their family . 
  i agree we in the eu should find fairer way of sharing the burden of genuine refugees . 
   you 're an idiot , is all i want to reply to that . 
  is that supposed to encourage a better quality of conversation ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
   people are running from death , rape , abduction and many other , terrible things if this were true , why are they travelling through many other safe countries to get to northern europe ? 
  what demands would they be ?

  [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/28/british-dream-europe-african-citizens ) is quite an interesting read . 
  i think you 're extrapolating from out of your arse , frankly . 
  yes i did , so what 's your point ? 
  edit : just as an aside , it 's hilarious that asking for clarification of the point someone 's trying to make should be controversial . 
   one in ten thousand take advantage . 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  it 's not the kind of thing you 're ever likely to see reliable data about , but that does n't mean it does n't happen . 
  i do n't think there 's any doubt that there are some cases where migrants are drawn to countries with generous welfare systems , it would be bizarre if there were n't . 
  maybe the eu needs a common policy on this , to stop the `` welfare shopping '' aspect of migration . 
  does n't matter they 're all cunts . 
  a drunk scottish chav ? 
   a european talk about hypocrisy ? 
  lol priceless . 
  typical arrogant western tourist rich coming from a swede no he is just an egyptian migrant living by his hatred towards muslims and turks typical / r/europe [ 1 ] anti-turkish bias maybe there 's some northern european social autism going on at this point , you 're just embarrassing yourself . 
  so , if you ca n't beat 'em join 'em , [ eh ?
