  i bet that trick gets him all the girls . 
   typical arrogant western tourist ha ha carry on with the hypocrisy , or do n't you see it in yourself ? 
   typical / r/europe [ 1 ] anti-turkish bias  maybe there 's some northern european social autism going on really ? 
  it 's kind of ironic you should say that , 
   and we had the constant feeling that we were walking money bags people wanted to extract as much profit from as possible . 
  i 've had the exact same feeling when going to both egypt and tunisia . 
  yet i 've been to other , much poorer countries than these and had very few problems . 
  austria is land-locked .

  i believe the people who are complaining about this have cynically picked it up and used it as a weapon against him . 
  i do n't think cameron meant anything by it , it 's a common word to use for a large crowd of people on the move . 
  [ `` just been revoked '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sixnuasjxry ), 
  that 's a fair question and the answer is relatively simply answered by these questions : 1 ) ` how do you define legitimate force ? ', 
  2 ) ` do you believe in the rule of law ? ', 
  i 'm no lawyer , and i 'm not french , but i 'm sure that burglary and stone throwing , threatening behaviour etc are all arrestable offences . 
  either way , it does n't matter really . 
  the police have no choice but to react if they know of such a threat , so blaming them for that is pointless . 
  i 'm pretty sure the police are n't being evil about this , if they had firm evidence about a particular migrant i 'm sure they 'd make the arrest . 
  incompetent or badly led , maybe . 
  i 'm not on the side of the migrants particularly , i 'm just saying that she 's not helping the situation by doing this . 
  i 'm sure the police would have reacted if they had anything to go on . 
  for example if one of the migrants had walked up to a policeman and said `` i 'm going to shoot that lady '' , they would have got the same treatment . 
  i can sympathise with how she feels , i would n't want all that on my doorstep , but ` joking ' about getting a gun and then blaming the police for reacting to that was just stupid .

  i was trying to give some context regarding how poles are , in my opinion , viewed by brits . 
  therefore these factors are still relevant today . 
  seriously , i do n't get it . 
  if we 're making jokes about poles in the uk it 's along the lines of `` how dare they come over here , work hard and do a decent job for reasonable wages ! '' . 
  they are seen as much better at integrating than , for example , muslim communities because we have a more similar culture , and they are well remembered as having a history of fighting with us against oppression . 
  my feeling is they 've built a straw man , and i do n't understand why . 
  the drama of literally giving blood is way over the top . 
  they were great fighters during ww2 , but let 's not forget they wanted to fight the nazis for revenge for what they did to poland , and we were in a position to enable them to do that . 
  yeah it 's definitely the beat . 
  you mean they 're not cunts ? 
  typical frenchman . 
  was probably trying to jump the queue . 
  did n't they hang a monkey there once because they thought it was a french spy ?

   poland and baltics in nato are mistake he 's not the only one thinking this https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2014-05-05/natos-biggest-mistake, 
  explain what you mean please . 
  so you think you know more about corbyn than corbyn ? 
  fascinating  o /, 
  it 's not a binary , it 's more nuanced . 
  `` his leadership would be the opposite of top-down changes , '' the spokesperson said . 
  `` he says we need some forms of public ownership in some cases , such as rail , on which matter labour needs to reflect more closely the views of the majority of the public . '', 
  corbyn is provoking some good old american-style communist panic amongst some in the uk . 
  and that 's fine by me . 
  he does n't want to bring back clause 4 . http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/09/jeremy-corbyn-denies-would-bring-back-clause-iv, 
  straw man argument . 
  he is not advocating full on traditional socialism . 
  i think the reason why jeremy is so popular right now , is he is trying to change what has become an accepted move to the right by all parties , taking the labour party with it , and away from it 's natural roots . 
  his ideas are more in line with mainstream popular opinion in the uk than some of labour and the conservatives would like . 
  he is the antidote to the professional politician : he will actually give a straight question a straight answer and this is a very refreshing change for a lot of brits . 
  he 's opening up the possibility of a more caring style of government after years of unbridled neo liberalism and out and out american style capitalism , mixed with state funded corporate welfare . 
  this is all very interesting to me , and i 'm hoping that he does lead the labour party . 
  as for being prime minister - well , who knows ? 
  a week is a long time in politics let alone 4 + years . 
  there 's plenty of time , and even if he does n't end up leading the labour party by the time of the next election i 'm hoping that he 'll drag the party back further to the left where it belongs . 
  the labour party lost a lot of it 's identity and ethos when it bent over backwards to ` become electable ' under blaire . 
  this correction is long overdue , and this is reflected in his almost breathtakingly fast rise to prominence .
