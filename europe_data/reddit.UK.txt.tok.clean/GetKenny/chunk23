  peace , a fairer society and better equality . 
  how dare he !, 
  there was a lot more balance than you might imagine . 
  and i stand by my statement . 
  no other country on / r/europe is so sensitive . 
  what about government , news papers , tv stations ? 
  are you making a random list or do you have a point to make ? 
  did you see the channel4 documentary ? 
  when you say the uk , i think you mean our government . 
  a lot of us hated those advertising campaigns and felt ashamed of our government . 
  that was news here because most people thought it was an outrageous insult . 
  there are other countries in europe , apart from germany . 
  romania is not , afaik singled out as being a ` shit ' country by the rest of europe . 
  i think romanians are , however , extremely sensitive and sometimes imagine insults where none exist . 
  which is why someone feels this thread is necessary . 
  romanians - stop worrying , you are equals among europeans . 
  which is a good thing . 
  mostly .

  there will be no real choice eventually , when support of current oss ceases , like xp . 
  most people are n't techy enough to make the alternatives work , and microsoft know this . 
  that 's a bit like being forced to agree with everything and anything your government does because you voted for them for their stance on one or two policies , and you did n't notice that buried deep in their manifesto they think the government should be able to take your first born as a slave . 
  i do n't mind paying for the ` privilege ' of not having ads , and in any case i would like to have the choice . 
  is this possible ?

   unlike the `` christians '' ( poles , romanians , brits ) who i 've personally seen fighting publicly a lot more . 
  if you do n't want people to generalise the isolated behaviour of some individuals to whole communities , then do n't do it yourself . 
  they burned down my home town in [ 1514 ] ( http://brightonmuseums.org.uk/discover/2014/06/06/brightons-first-map-the-french-attack-of-1514/ ) never forget . 
  there are many more countries making top quality cheeses than the 3 you mentioned . 
  why just these 3 ? 
  it 's made of unicorns and fairly dust , and it lives in lala land . 
  quoting you :  i think the media are exaggerating that a bit . 
  of course some countries are in the spotlight , but that 's far from going full eu dictator . 
  i 'm losing the will to live now . 
  learn what a straw man is first , then come back to me when you 're feeling a bit calmer . 
  call what a straw man ? 
  [ calm down ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/12thi1vipconee/giphy.gif ), 
  i did n't prove a damn thing . 
  have another look at the straw man link . 
  yeah , beautiful plumage . 
   russian-speakers in moldova you 've missed the point / joke / half-joke *, 
  you do n't think germany is calling the shots in the ez ? 
   https://youtu.be/aolimna2298?t=58 we have a saying : ` he who pays the piper calls the tune ', 
  who said anything about being a full dictator ? 
  [ straw man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man ), 
  my parrot is pining for the fjords . 
   a unified germany would pull considerably more weight . 
  ... and eventually start throwing it about , telling other countries what to do . 
  haha !, 
  how ridiculous was that ? 
  wait ...

  and the other half think hitler was born in australia . 
  did anyone ever seriously think otherwise ? 
  ... and if you focus on trade with anyone but russia you are asking for annexation . 
  so much shouting . 
  i do n't think anyone 's saying the soldiers were themselves to blame . 
  it was the governments . 
  how is this rewriting history ? 
  the article is saying more or less what you are , in any sense that counts . 
   you had never killed a man guarding natives . 
  i do n't know what you mean by this , it does n't make much sense . 
  when you say ` shooting in the air ' did you mean ` shooting on the ground ' - i.e. 
  nato attacks on serbian artillery ? 
  i 'm not sure what your point is , really . 
   you and i are not responsible for what foreigners do to other foreigners . 
  in this case i am feeling at least partly responsible for what my government did or did not do . 
  we had a duty of care to those people when we set up the so called ` safe area ' , and we failed them miserably . 
  we knew what was going to happen and we stood by and did nothing to stop it . 
  you ca n't totally separate yourself from the decisions made by your government in a democratic country , and saying it 's none of our business is callous and completely wrong .

  high five o / \\ o, 
  we are the scots of the eu . 
  this is true , but it 's no excuse . 
  we ( uk / us ) were there , and involved . 
  i have always felt shame whenever i think about this . 
  i blame anthony wedgwood benn . 
  did you mean romanised ? 
  or 5000 times the length of agrippa 's foot . 
  yes , they just frown on you holding hands with your heterosexual so . 
  ironic you should say that . 
  yes that 's right . 
  an estate in the uk is n't * necessarily * comparable to a ghetto , we 'd qualify it somehow , like ` poor ' or ` rough ' . 
  they do n't like it up 'em . 
  yup that 's pretty much it i reckon . 
   context  towards the direction of active inclusion and in accordance with the migrants ' integration establishment , the european commission policy context means the fight against poverty and social exclusion of society 's vulnerable groups ( european commission , 2008 ; european parliament resolution , 2009 ) . 
  the active inclusion strategy of the eu also includes ensuring a decent standard of living for migrants outside the labour market , by providing them with adequate social and housing assistance , as is widely stated in eu law .
