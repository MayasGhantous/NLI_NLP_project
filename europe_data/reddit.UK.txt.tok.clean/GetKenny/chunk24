  such integrity . 
   the notion of a wwii film and the demand ` ihre papiere ' ? 
  this is it exactly imo . 
  it 's not stretching it to think that it could be abused , especially against minorities . 
  one should be able to just be a person and go about your business without having to justify yourself by producing the correct piece of paper/plastic . 
  they are ineffective anyway . 
  an organised criminal/terrorist will have access to professionally made fake id cards , and there 's no evidence that id cards prevents crime or terrorism . 
  and they 're expensive . 
  i get the impression that most of eastern europe , as well as russia thought along the same lines . 
  i could be wrong . 
  why luxembourg ? 
  i do n't think you 've thought this through very well . 
  there 's a difference between having a low tax economy and using a tax haven . 
  that would depend in which side of the 99 % - 1 % dividing line you are on . 
  poor jean-claude . 
  as the long-standing president of one of the major tax havens in europe , wo n't someone think of his feelings ? 
  4 years ago . 
  that 's scraping the barrel . 
  stop picking on bigots - they 're people too !, 
  you 're welcome . 
  default and be damned already . 
  the lender bears some responsibility for reckless loans . 
  because they are euros , not drachmas . 
  that 's exactly what they want you to believe . 
  maybe . 
  the people voted for it . 
  sorry to hear about the currency problems , but as a brit i just had to compliment you on your orderly queueing . 
  so surprise me . 
  with some evidence . 
  he 's being a bit racist . 
  australia 's leaving us ? 
  it 's a pity they 've only started now , they must have known about them before yesterday , in order to act so quickly against specific mosques . 
  being cynical maybe for a second here but nothing motivates more than losing a big chunk of your foreign cash influx , i heard about 15 % gdp overall is down to tourism . 
  [ it 's started .

  typical romanian . 
  if / r/europe is worse than / r/worldnews then it is truly fucked . 
  no you calm down big nose . 
  how dare you . 
  they burned down my home town in 1514 . 
  the french are there to be whinged about . 
  always was . 
   something 's not quite right in / r/europe . 
  true , but compared to / r/worldnews it 's a utopia, 
  yeah , what about turkey ? 
  i think he 's being perfectly reasonable . 
  no , ukip are not far right . 
  there are some far right people supporting ukip , and they are further right than the tories , but it would be wrong to call them far right as in golden dawn far right , for example , or the now largely defunct bnp . 
  and now you 're adding to comments that have already been replied to. , and * you 're * deliberately misinterpreting what i 've said in a desperate attempt to avoid losing an argument . 
  your perspective is twisted beyond all reason . 
  if someone is ` debunking ' one side more than the other , then that can hardly be described as a fact check . 
  the facts are often ` inconclusive ' . 
  if you want a strong , definite answer , it 's often going to come from a source that is biased with a strong agenda . 
  that 's an odd way of looking at it . 
  how is wanting to get at the facts not a level playing field , and how is misrepresenting the facts a level playing field ? 
  what if one is more to the right or left than the other ? 
  so you 'd prefer the mail or the mirror to misrepresent things according to their political leanings , and there to be no room for any attempts at factual reporting . 
  [ yeah , right ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/88629-jim-carrey-laughing-gif-liar-l-gtdr.gif ) . 
  ouch . 
  that 's right . 
  many ditch their passports because then the authorities ca n't repatriate them . 
   ( x ) people can agree with a dumb statement ... 
  welcome to reddit , 
  beyond the hyperbole , there is some cooperation going on , and some acknowledgement of joint responsibility . 
  i think , however , that the outlandish comments made by the mayor of calais are n't helping at all .

   we should be sending many millions of euros to help i thought we were . 
  maybe they 'll burn down my home town , [ just like they did in 1514 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_brighton#16th_and_17th_centuries ) . 
  \\ #neverforget . 
  this is n't hyperbole at all . 
  putin : `` if only the rest of the world was like russia ... '', 
  `` we welcome our new lizard overlords . 
  shall we round up the french for you ? '', 
  come back when you can type by * thinking * , 
  i think we 're getting to the point now where this is pretty much accepted by everyone who is n't already filthy rich . 
  you 're in a time warp or something . 
  i was playing ultima online using voice recognition in the late '90s . 
  he is saying all foreigners are thieves and scroungers . 
  no it 's not . 
  i wonder if we ( the uk ) had n't agreed to back the us on iraq , that would have made any difference . 
  if there was one thing in recent history that could be changed , surely iraq would be # 1 for saving the most misery , lives , and general global security . 
  i 'm confused why he said that . 
  the enemies of ` bad ' people are not necessarily ` good ' . 
  that 's not an answer . 
  i 'm impressed . 
   russia should have blocked the iraq war with a un veto . 
  why did n't they ? 
  say something bad about russia . 
  go on i dare you . 
  french ? 
  [ pikeys * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghrbmek18ui ), 
  we ( specially the brits ) joke about it because of the old french/english thing going back centuries , but in reality whenever you generalise about any group , you are probably going to be wrong a lot of the time . 
  they do n't allow waltzing in us jails apparently . 
  incest is illegal in the uk , and there are age restrictions . 
  right sonny you 're on the list . 
  believe it froggy . 
  now back to your onions with you . 
  you forked out enough cash to go to france ? 
  obviously not a typical scot ,
