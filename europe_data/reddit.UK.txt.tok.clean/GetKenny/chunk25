  extracts from a q&a about ttip by the ec :  q. 
  will ttip overrule eu laws ? 
   ttip will not overrule , repeal or amend eu legislation . 
  the eu 's 28 member countries and the european parliament would have to approve any changes to eu laws or regulations in order to liberalise trade . 
  how will ttip uphold the eu 's strict standards that protect people and the environment ? 
  show or hide the answer  q. 
  will ttip open the eu market to hormone-fed beef from the us ? 
  hormone-fed beef is banned in the eu . 
  that will not change under ttip . 
   tough eu laws designed to protect human life and health , animal health and welfare , or the environment and consumers will not be changed because of ttip .

  i think the severe prescription drug problem is limited to only a couple of countries , the us being the biggest one afaik . 
  there is plenty of stuff out there on theories about how decriminalisation has this effect , but they are just theories , and it remains a correlation without proof of causation . 
  the english do n't hate the scots . 
  the opposite might be true , though . 
  you keep out of it .

  speaking as a brit , i do n't think we really have a stereotype about the portuguese . 
  historically , i mean from way back , we have always got on , and afaik our view of you is positive . 
  we know you 're having a hard time of it at the moment , but that does n't mean that 's all we think about you . 
  in the uk the police and the prison system are being cut back regardless . 
  we have falling crime , and they do n't have any influence over the government anyway . 
  you say i might have a point if ... then you start on about the cia . 
  this is europe not america . 
  that graph came from [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blog/success-portugal%e2%80%99s-decriminalisation-policy-%e2%80%93-seven-charts ) overall , virtually every measurable outcome has improved since 2001 , but you seem to want to interpret and select the data only in terms of what you can say is worse or no better . 
  it 's not a panacea , i do n't think anyone ever said it was . 
   constantly persecute and criminalize a vast group within your population , you have an excuse for weapon development/purchases , prison unions/for profit prisons and the need for huge budgets in customs/border control/anti-drug agencies . 
  this sounds paranoid to me . 
  it 's far more likely to be incompetence and fear of change , rather than evilness . 
  [ this article ] ( https://fullfact.org/factchecks/portugal_decriminalisation_drugs_effects-3276 ) contains a table from 1999 . 
  looking at the data from 2001 , like [ this ] ( http://www.tdpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/deaths.jpg ) there is a big reduction starting when compared to 2001 . 
  it would be quite a coincidence if there was a sharp peak at 2001 , with a low level before . 
  if you 're interested in stats and how they can be manipulated , [ this ] ( http://www.samefacts.com/2010/10/drug-policy/scientific-proof-that-drug-decriminalization-in-portugal-saved-lives-and-killed-people/ ) is quite a good read . 
  but the the weather 's nice , so you 've at least got that going for you . 
  successive uk governments have had a totally illogical drugs policy , ignoring the best evidence by their own science advisers . 
  the only reason i can think of for this that makes any sense at all is they are frightened of the daily mail readers et al. 
  because the eu is not a federation , no matter how you look at it . 
  you ca n't compare the eu to the us in this way . 
  there is correlation , but as yet no causative link has been definitely established . 
  one explanation might be that the quality of the drugs is better , and more relevant - more consistent in purity . 
  drug overdoses are often caused by a batch of unexpectedly pure product being sold , where users have become accustomed to drugs that have been diluted by cutting with inert substances . 
  there is also better support for addicts , and they are n't afraid of asking for help . 
  much higher . 
  there is plenty of info out there . 
   holy shit , my country being mentioned for something good . 
  i did n't know this was such a rare thing .
