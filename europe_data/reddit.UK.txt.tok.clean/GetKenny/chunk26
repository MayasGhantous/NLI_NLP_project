  you 're saying that the swedish people accusing russians of being homophobic is being racist ? 
  that 's a bit controversial , seeing as russian popular opinion about gays is one of the most homophobic in the world . 
  be thankful it was n't a black gay sailor sign . 
  i doubt ` the captain ' took the decision to be there all by himself .

  :  about three-quarters of russians do n't think homosexuality should be accepted by society .

   this week 's vote is seen in mainland europe as a brexit barometer . 
  an indication as to how likely - or not - it might be that britain will choose to exit the eu .

  as mark twain once said [ ... ] ( http://www.full-stop.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/never-argue-with-stupid-people-mark-twain.jpg ), 
  virtually all of your post are about islam , or immigrants , or islamic immigrants . 
   once there is a convergent enough foreign policy . 
  we can live in hope , you beautiful dreamer , 
  it ( permission to act on behalf of the eu ) will still need the consensus of the eu - the same problem that makes it impossible for us to have a joint military force . 
  * shrugs * if you ca n't explain it , then what are you complaining about ? 
  the only answer to this is going to be some kind of eu military force , and as i said right at the top , that 's going to be complicated . 
  so , for the meantime france , uk etc will be on their own when it comes down to any military action they take abroad , and the costs involved . 
  it seems unfair but i do n't see any other way . 
  i really do n't see it as misrepresenting the overall position . 
  could you please explain to me how it does ? 
  the fake quote must be damaging for it to be slander . 
  so i assume they are including other countries that make similar actions in this ? 
  what slander ? 
  do n't worry about it , your english is much better than my french so i have no reason to complain really - it 's just an excuse for some cross-channel banter , 
  you have some as well . 
   big ass army * twitches *, 
  the point remains though . 
  there should be europe wide agreement before any actions if the country involved expects the eu to be involved financially . 
  i 'm not aware that france or the uk or any other eu member asked the eu before acting . 
  i do n't think it was his intotion . 
  if the eu as a bloc agreed on a strategy , then the eu should foot the bill . 
  otherwise , if country ( a ) decides to act , and another country ( b ) that has no control over ( a ) s actions , happens to benefit from it , then unless there was some prior agreement ( b ) has no obligation to compensate ( a ) . 
   france voted a 450m budget allowed for defence , and ended up spending more than 1,1 b because of decisions made by the eu . 
  what decision was this ? 
  [ * hugs * ] ( http://www.sunnyskyz.com/uploads/2013/03/gjtqx-english-bulldog-hug.jpg ), 
  france decides how much it spends , luxembourg has no say in it , therefore it is unreasonable for france to complain . 
  if it has any problem with the way things are , it should withdraw its protection . 
  i do kind of agree , sort of , but as i said , it 's complicated . 
  you 're improving . 
  yeah i know . 
  possessive . 
  * sigh * and you missed a couple ,
