  whatever the case , it 's now a moot point . 
  the russian economy is showing enough resilience that it appears unlikely to check putin 's behavior abroad . 
  public opinion surveys at home provide little evidence that the people have turned on him . 
  for washington and its allies , the time for wishful thinking is over . 
  vladimir putin is not going anywhere . 
  correction : this article originally incorrectly stated severstal 's exports accounted for 20 percent of output . 
  exports were 30 percent in 2014 . 
  additionally , an incorrect statement that severstal plans to add at least 2,000 new workers has been removed . 
  there is no real significance to this . 
   england proper lol . 
  and you were doing so well . 
  this is all exactly accurate . 
  you 're right . 
  my info was out of date . 
  the same large scale slaughter happens in greece , france , italy and the rest of the mediterranean , as well as most of the rest of europe . 
  i find it incredible that given all of the rules and regulations issued from the eu , this is still allowed to go on . 
  edit : apparently legislation was put in for all countries except malta . 
  you said ` screwed ' : in a difficult or hopeless situation ; ruined or broken . 
  hence i said ` exaggerated ', 
  the relationship between ireland and the uk both pre-dates and transcends the eu . 
  there is no reason why easy trade should n't continue between the two with ireland inside the eu . 
  i think you 're exaggerating the potential for problems . 
  i do n't understand . 
  i 'm not a brexit advocate , but i see no reason why trade should suddenly stop between ireland and the uk . 
  no no no that 's not how it works in reddit . 
  you 're supposed to say something like `` fuck off !, 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about , you wanker '' .

  he won an award you know .

  what about [ edgar hooley ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_purnell_hooley ) ? 
  1 ) i thought this was well known . 
  2 ) i do n't know about that - we still have lots of french phrases that we use verbatim , and because it was the language of the aristocracy using french words day to day was always looked on as being a bit classy , or pretentious , depending on your pov . 
  and did we tell you the name of the game , boy ? 
  we call it riding the gravy traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnn . 
  [ juncker on guitar ] ( https://youtu.be/k9efrqzhrku?t=199 ), 
  ah yes the good old days . 
  i do n't believe anyone thought for a second that the rich and powerful would be at all inconvenienced . 
  never underestimate the amount of shit reddit is willing to give the uk over pretty much any topic you care to choose . 
  as , i imagine , are most countries that rely on russia for anything essential . 
  [ i wonder what happened last time with russia vs finland ... ] ( http://cominganarchy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/spart-of-ww2.jpg ), 
  having an army made up from different countries that do n't have a strong political union seems a bit daft to me . 
  news travels fast ? 
  this kind of thinking led to thousands of russian troops being sent to gulags after returning from being exposed to western culture during wwii . 
  oh well , i tried , 
  then you 're missing the point completely . 
  read the comments made so far , it 's not the fact the numbers are different , it 's the fact they 're both so tiny . 
  it 's like buying two lottery tickets instead of one , you 've doubled your chances of winning , but you still have almost zero chance , so effectively it 's the same . 
  got it ? 
  if the numbers are very far from being even vaguely realistic they are useless in this case . 
  i ca n't see the uk on the list . 
  to make the numbers even vaguely realistic . 
  you 'd need to add a few zeros after the decimal point in both numbers , making the choice of the lower number effectively meaningless in real terms . 
   i know the chances of something bad happening are extraordinarily low that 's it really . 
  the rest is psychological . 
  bon chance , my froggy friend . 
  they need decent cctv . 
   some israelis even accuse europe of building its own version of `` settlements '' . 
  ... so that would be a bad thing to do then ? 
  which is literally ( ish ) what op said . 
  then it 's not a shepherd 's pie . 
  vengeance should have no place in the actions of a state . 
  ... but then again it might not .

  the russian figure looks strange .

  nice try , 
   hang them up by the gibbets . 
  did you * really * mean next to or near the gibbets ? 
  or did you mean by the giblets ?

  this is a uk paper . 
  france latvia and the netherlands could also have this as a headline in papers in their respective countries . 
  same could apply to the bottom 10 , really . 
  curiously , we 're # 2 at getting at least 1 right . 
  well . 
  that 's just insulting . 
  that 's the price we pay for all the [ beautiful greenery ] ( http://www.bluebadgestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/england-travel-yorkshire-hchalkley.jpg ), 
  because they voted for it . 
  there 's no guarantee with the smart ones , either . 
  sometimes , and maybe often in international politics , telling a bare faced lie , like denying it happened at all and just sticking to that is the most effective defence against accusations that are true . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uagledb7cds ) is an excellent demonstration from father ted to illustrate the point . 
  you ca n't say it 's ignorance , and in the next breath say it 's well known . 
  yeah ok whatever you won . 
  i did n't imply that at all . 
  it just said they made it to the southern half of spain , which is a surprise to a lot of people . 
  like i said , you 're just looking for an argument . 
  i was n't talking about lithuania , and when you started with your comment on `` no '' it sounded to me like you were saying they did n't get there . 
  but i guess you were just looking for an argument . 
  * sigh * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_spain, 
  they got as far north as the southern half of spain . 
  that 's a * good * question .

  i 'd say to a large degree the uk . 
  you seem to want to make excuses for bigots .
