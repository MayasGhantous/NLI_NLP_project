  there 's only so far you can take this analogy , but there is a reason why insurers charge youngsters sky high premiums . 
  so , 18 * is * about right then . 
  there 's loads of research evidence to suggest that 16 year olds are less capable of making rational decisions than adults because their brains are n't fully formed yet . 
  a 16 year old that mastered these things would be called a genius , 1 in a million , maybe more . 
  a or b a ) drive at the speed limit a good distance behind the car in front . 
  b ) drive past the car in front around a blind bend to impress your mates , while half drunk . 
  ask any car insurance broker . 
  edit : that 's a binary decision , btw . 
  at 16 the brain is [ not yet fully formed .

  should n't happen *, 
  * hugs *, 
   sausages and angry people sounds like a dangerous combination . 
  they were just obeying hors d'oeuvres . 
  could be norway . 
  yeah , right . 
  they got that far north - it was cold , windy , raining and miserable . 
  when it was n't raining and windy the midges ate them alive . 
  on top of that they were being constantly raided by thousands of ginger psychopaths . 
  what would you do ? 
  that was n't a rimshot , like he asked for , but it * was * what he really wanted . 
  scotland is getting older . 
  in 10 years time there will be many more pensioners than there are now . 
  they 're really bad . 
  even a scot will tell you that . 
  further devolution was in the pipeline anyway . 
  they say spain is pretty , though i 've never been . 
  `` we have some stingy people '' lol . 
   certainly scots are more socialist lets hope so , they 're making a lot of promises . 
  edit : [ you might find this pdf interesting ] ( http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/files/scotcen-ssa-report.pdf ), 
  that 's their aim . 
  it 's a good thing that the poorer families are going to get involved in this like never before , but are they being told the truth ? 
  [ ready ? 
  and a one , two , three , four ... ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/the_723558_357598.jpg ), 
   i enthusiastically became an american citizen . 
  what ? 
  stay in spain ? 
  that is now blocked due to ` copyright ', 
  does the uploader have a choice in this then ? 
  and if so why on earth would they limit it ? 
  could be worse . 
  at least we 're not french . 
  err ... 
  [ she ca n't tell us anything about flags ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utduy7qkvk8 ), 
  by ` room to talk ' you mean our own alcohol problems ? 
  that does n't mean we ca n't talk about scandinavia and alcohol . 
  it 's not a competition . 
  what is it with scandinavians and alcohol ? 
  chicken oriental ? 
  to some americans , everything always is . 
   no , not really . 
  you either do n't seem to understand the meaning of those words or grasp what i am saying . 
  what you 're saying is both contradictory and paradoxical . 
  it is possible that i both understand what i 'm saying , and you 're just plain wrong . 
  when i said we would need to lose diversity in order for a central european government to work , i backed it up with an example . 
  it is not unsupported . 
  maybe you should read it again . 
  your assertion that it 's not a good example does n't really hold up because it is a real example , not some hypothetical dreamed up , and is therefore realistic . 
  your version of going forward would be to put all member states in the same position as scotland and catalonia , small powerless states with very little voice in what happens to them . 
  eventually we might end up with something like the usa , but we 're just too diverse for that to happen for a while yet . 
   yes because we stand at a middle ground . 
  we can either go forward and survive , go backwards thus stand alone and be taken over or stand still and be partitioned . 
  and you talk to me about unsupported assertions ? 
  also this is a particularly glaring false dichotomy . 
  there 's nothing to suggest we will be taken over , go backwards or otherwise be defeated if we do n't follow your blinkered vision of how things should be . 
  there are other ways to proceed from where we are . 
  interesting chat though . 
  over and out . 
  again with the contradictions and paradoxes . 
  in order for what you described to work , we would indeed have to ** lose ** our diversity , otherwise it ( central super government ) would n't work . 
  there 's no way such a government could cater for such diversity that the member states will have for the medium future at least . 
  look at scotland and the uk . 
  you will not find a more homogeneous union of two states in the world , and yet the scots do n't feel that london is capable of catering for the needs of scotland and the rest of the uk at the same time . 
  they want their own government , not just devolved powers as you describe , but a proper government with full powers within the existing framework of the eu . 
  speaking of which , some member states ( the uk being one ) are saying they want some powers returned to them from the eu . 
  ukip - a ridiculous party - is , nonetheless doing well here on just that issue . 
  then there 's catalonia ... 
  yahoo - the fisher price news outlet . 
  do n't worry , we 'll be sending ` humanitarian convoys ' across the border in the event of a yes vote . 
  that 's a real paradox you 've described there . 
  scotland . 
  ^ ^ too ^ ^ soon ? 
  ^ ^ * sniff *, 
  i think after the last phone call she had with putin she said he sounded like he was on acid or something . 
  irish , mainly . 
  [ do n't be silly , no one does that any more ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kani2dpxlw ), 
  ah sure that 's grand , 
  and there 's an irishman peering over your shoulder as you type ... 
  not to a troll . 
  in that case maybe you should stick to german . 
  not a cheap joke at all , what you said seemed quite clear . 
  i was just asking you about what you yourself said , or should we just ignore everything you say from now on ? 
  you mean to say that every other eu nation is fuelling russian bombers ? 
  who said ` we ' want germany to take the lead on this ? 
  germany has far too much vested interest in russia to be trusted to act in an impartial way about this . 
  where is the voice of the rest of the eu ? 
  [ where is he ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ptriqhkmhy ), 
  i would assume not . 
  if there was any choice about this , it looks a bit careless .
