   let 's review the facts . 
  lord elgin paid the enormous sum of # 39,000 to acquire the marbles , and was careful to obtain documents from the turkish government approving their removal from greece , which had then been part of the ottoman empire for 350 years . 
  since parliament legally purchased the marbles from lord elgin in 1816 , the british museum 's title to them is unassailable . 
  the greeks know this perfectly well -- otherwise , instead of pulling this pr stunt , they would be suing britain in the european courts .

   climate change denial is a set of organized attempts to downplay , deny or dismiss the ** scientific consensus ** on the extent of global warming , its significance , and its connection to human behavior , especially for commercial or ideological reasons . 
  [ climate change denial ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_change_denial ) basically , at this point , anyone who denies there is a connection between changes in the climate and human activity is going against the evidence produced by and the opinions of the overwhelming majority of the scientific community . 
   `` who is white ? '' is an important question that should be discussed without assuming that differing viewpoints are ipso facto `` divisive . '' ours is the only race to have devised and maintained freedom of speech and thought ; i 'm confident we can still handle a little vigorous back-and-forth . 
  it 's one thing for jews , the left , and government to suppress speech .

  [ source : andrew hamilton - white census ] ( http://www.counter-currents.com/2014/01/white-census/ ) how is the human genome politically influenced ? 
  you really do n't know what a climate change denier is ? 
  if you want to continue like this we might have to go back and define the alphabet . 
  `` the human genome '' is the most up to date and informed study we have so far , it would be silly to discount it in a discussion about genetics . 
  andrew hamilton is a white supremacist , and a complete and utter nutter . 
  you may as well quote a climate change denier . 
   one of the most interesting findings of the human genome project was just how closely related all humans are and just what a myth the concept of race really is . 
  the differences between individual humans are , in fact , much greater than the differences between groups of humans .

  on one hand , given the history one can completely understand why both sides would want to remain distinct in their identities , but after 600 years of occupation and the physical closeness and inevitable interbreeding that would imply , can you really rely on racial purity between these two ? 
  there are some good arguments for saying that race is a social construct . 
  http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/what-we-mean-when-we-say-race-is-a-social-construct/275872/ consider this : `` race is an exceedingly slippery concept . 
  although it appears in social life as ubiquitous , omnipresent and real , it is hard to pin down the concept in any objective sense , this is because the idea of race is riddled with apparent contradictions . 
  while it is a dynamic phenomena rooted in political struggle , it is commonly observed as a fixed characteristic of human populations ; while it does not exist in terms of human biology , people routinely look to the human body for evidence about racial identity ; while it is a biological fiction , it is nonetheless a social fact .
