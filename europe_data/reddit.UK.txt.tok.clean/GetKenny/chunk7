  i do n't know , you see big differences in wealth in the usa , from state to state . 
  honestly , i do n't think it changes very much over the years . 
  these days we do very little to antagonise each other , nor do we do much to improve relations , so i do n't think there is much difference . 
  i think france is going through a bit of a tough period right now , but generally , apart from laughing at them sometimes ( the recent train thing comes to mind ) i think my fellow brits wish them well . 
  sometimes i wish we could get together more often and cooperate on certain things , apart from the channel tunnel , [ just look ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concorde ) at what we can do when we combine our talents !, 
   [ this image ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/609/815/941.png ) for me , sums up the long and complicated relationship between france and the uk quite well . 
  no , you 're right . 
  they are hilarious . 
  not really . 
  the french have no sense of humour , 
  is it just me or is the spiegel turning into the daily mail ? 
  britain and france love to quarrel . 
  do n't be so vindictive , edward , it seems you are the narrow minded one . 
  why not both ? 
   the eu 's stringent regulations remain alien today . 
  that 's a funny thing to say , seeing as the uk applies eu laws more stringently than some others . 
  these people ? 
  federalists do n't care , as long as they get what they want . 
  ca n't say i blame you , i 'm thinking of doing the same . 
  yeah , i read about what the spiegel was reporting . 
  i get a bit irritated with / r/europe tbh , and the way lots of people here just want to believe any old crap reported in the press , as long as it goes along with the stupid ` uk is anti eu ' , or ` anything anti uk in general ' narrative . 
  is he ? 
  that 's the first i 've heard of it . 
  you 're assuming we want to leave . 
  it was rhetorical . 
  the question is misleading and incorrect in it 's assumption . 
  let 's not pretend america 's foreign wars are n't about increasing or maintaining influence . 
  which britains are they ? 
  brits *, 
  it 's a freudian slip , revealing how a lot of americans think of europe . 
  really ? 
  calm down . 
  you 'll be happier and live longer , and your compatriots will be less ashamed of you . 
   oh wait , you 're some british dickbag . 
  why am i not surprised you sound just like the dickhead you 're complaining about . 
  how dare you ask a question . 
   schadenfreude for all of europe why ? 
  it seems all we need is a common enemy . 
   intellectual ( and moral ) pygmies i do n't think that 's the only reason somehow , 
  the enemy of my enemy is my friend ? 
  `` imagine a boot stamping on the human face forever '', 
  and yet here you are , at the dunce end of the thread . 
  classic [ whataboutism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ), 
  the speed of light is , demonstrably and apparently , possible . 
  here you are , at the `` you done fucked up '' end of the thread . 
   but that 's it haha . 
  yeah , right . 
  too late , they 've started jerking already . 
  [ best just run for it . 
  yeah , fucking democracy . 
   it can be called a form of civil war prevention . 
  steady on . 
  if a week is a long time in politics , then 1979 is a long , long time ago . 
  i believe that attitudes have changed an awful lot since then , especially with your average english person 's attitude to the scots , despite what some scots still think . 
  again , personally , i do n't think that a 1 % majority was enough for such a major change . 
  the chances are if the vote had been held again , there might easily have been 2 % changing their minds , ending up with a majority in the other direction . 
  even with a no to independence vote , i ca n't see westminster denying scotland some flavour of devo max . 
  never go full putin . 
  what 's the difference between a bison and a buffalo ? 
  you ca n't wash your hands in a buffalo . 
  * gets coat *, 
  as major as this ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  but in any case , blame that scot , 
  reading further , the 40 % clause was added by a scot , who had a seat in england . 
  kind of ironic . 
  i found this a bit sad : * the campaign for a `` no '' vote was much helped by an assurance by former prime minister lord home of the hirsel that a future conservative government would introduce legislation which would meet the objections . 
  this pledge , made by lord home in a personal capacity , was not honoured by the conservatives when they came to power a few months later . 
  * [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_devolution_referendum,_1979#.2240.25.22_rule ) if a similar vote was held in england , i ca n't imagine what , but let 's say something important and life changing , i 'm not sure that i 'd want such a slim majority to change things so significantly . 
  in cases like this i think there should be a much bigger majority , who are clearly in favour , before making such a change . 
   that referendum was so dodgy that it 's held by the un as an example of how not to hold a referendum . 
  can you point to a source for this , it sounds quite interesting . 
   it was included as a vote winner , not out of some desire to see a better democratic system for scotland ; that was made patently clear by the way the 1979 included the clause and the way the parliament was set up . 
  that 's just your opinion . 
  so you 're still referring back to the '79 one , like you want to use the same example twice ? 
  ~ ~ you 're right , it was badly worded . ~ ~ edit : wait a minute , that 's not right . 
  it * is * true to say that certain powers have been slowly transferred over the years . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_scottish_devolution ), 
  yes , as i said not enough votes . 
  where do you think i get my information from ? 
  if it had a 40 % clause , then it 's not a simple majority win is it ? 
  you try to make it sound like this clause was added by the evil government after the fact , but this is not the case . 
  if i understand it correctly the 1979 referendum was a vote for the scots , to create a devolved assembly , which there were n't sufficient votes for . 
  how was this linked to snp support for labour , and why would the snp agree to this ? 
  the second referendum , which was in the labour manifesto ( and amazingly they came good on their promise ) which was about having a scottish parliament with certain powers , was voted for , and so now we have a scottish parliament . 
  you make it sound like this is some kind of evil plot , with the scottish people having been hoodwinked by a political party making election promises , and then keeping them ? 
  those bastards . 
  scotland has been slowly given more and more autonomy over the years regardless of the `` threat '' of independence . 
  the government wants the union to stay intact , but to say they are scared is to overstate things . 
  most english people are pretty `` meh '' about the whole thing . 
  we do get a bit fed up with being shown the victim card though . 
  oh come on , hardly ad homininimems . 
   if history is any precedent , we wo n't get any powers unless those powers are a bargaining chip do you have any evidence for this ? 
  scared of what ? 
  that 's funny , because all i keep reading is how the scots actually put in more than they take out . 
  sit down and eat a deep fried mars bar or something , you sound angry and upset . 
  this was going to happen sooner or later regardless . 
  [ ` devo max ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_fiscal_autonomy_for_scotland ) has been on the cards since around 2005, 
  nonsense . 
  almost certainly .
