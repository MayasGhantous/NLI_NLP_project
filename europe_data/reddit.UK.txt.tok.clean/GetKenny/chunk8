  so what are you here for , to sit there with your hands over your ears , shouting at the top of your voice about how much you hate something but you do n't know why , and you ca n't be arsed to find out ? 
   but also a variety of other pages . 
  again , generalising without actually saying anything . 
  if you 're going to say these things about the uk and cameron in particular you need evidence , otherwise it just comes across like blind , baseless hatred . 
   saying `` the uk '' is pretty valid . 
  no , it really is n't . 
  i would prefer manannin to explain what he means , because i think he 's best placed to do that . 
  if you mean the press , you should say that , instead of just saying the uk . 
  when you say cameron has put up these blocks , i 'm not sure what you mean by that . 
  cameron has n't put up any blocks . 
  what do you mean when you say `` cameron ... to have stricter controls on the internet in general . '' ? 
  if it 's not to do with child porn or other illegal stuff , what do you think the motive is ? 
  weather is n't everything . 
  i think they come for a number of reasons . 
  * our tax laws . 
  * rule of law in general i.e. 
  safety . 
  * english speaking . 
  * it 's just generally nicer here than where they come from . 
  * because of the weather , it is rather green and pleasant when it 's not raining , 
  a few have them , but they are looked on as gadgets/toys really . 
  shush , we like to be the villain , 
  so brave . 
  in history *, 
  says the guy called * ^ oh , ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ mind ^ ^ ^ ^  *, 
  could you explain how so please ? 
  the swiss are always voting on all sorts of things . 
   referendums are a unique feature of switzerland 's unique brand of social democracy , which gives citizens the power to shape policy over the government . 
  any individual or group can challenge existing legislation or force a vote on a new issue by collecting 100,000 signatures on a petition . 
  i ca n't work out why this comment was downvoted . 
  is it because you asked a question about piigs ? 
  or do people not like this reality of the uk 's contribution ? 
  or is it because you are admitting to not knowing something ? 
  or is it because it is vaguely pro-uk ? 
  ( even if in a round-about way ) . 
  they should have seen that this is not a police matter , and done nothing . 
  true , but i 'm pretty sure this was a one-off occurrence , some kind of mistake . 
  if russia had been cheered , and won the competition , do n't you think that putin would have taken that as a sign of approval ? 
  it 's a sad fact that you ca n't take politics out of any international meeting such as eurovision . 
  i feel bad for the twins , but hopefully they understood not to take it personally . 
  it 's quite a common phrase to use for what he is describing . 
  we secretly like it . 
   `` we need to see three things happen . 
  first , politicians need to be better at talking about the real state of affairs of the country , rather than spinning the numbers . 
  secondly , the media has to try and genuinely illuminate issues , rather than use statistics to sensationalise . 
  i do n't see how wind can provide 100 % . 
  unless they 've solved the storage problem they will have to import or use some other source when there is n't enough wind blowing . 
  thanks for that . 
  at least now when the yanks say we have terrible teeth we can point eastwards over the sea and say `` it 's not our fault '' . 
  [ tell us about it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrsgsb7_l2y ), 
  poor denmark . 
  the only glory they have is a tenuous , dim and distant connection with britain , 
  so , they rejected our rejection ... . [ hmmm ] ( http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q445/greendemon77/austin_powers_mike_myers_as_dr_evil.jpg ), 
  i did n't downvote . 
  it 's a shame you do n't like british jokes enough to get mine , 
  criticism of the uk is illegal . 
  you have been banned from / r/unitedkindom . 
  do n't dis the bean . 
  typical brit . 
  competence *, 
  perhaps you should differentiate the eu and europe . 
  one is political , the other is geographical . 
  op should have made this clear . 
  i prefer the version from / r/ichbinsisyphos . 
  at least it 's a real quote , 
  why is your flair usa ? 
  i think it might be quite funny watching those two trying to deal with each other if there happens to be some sort of dispute . 
  everything i said was sincere , you 're kind of trolling yourself . 
  so you 're saying that you think he was serious when he said there were millions of cia stooges at maiden . 
  just to clarify : the question marks ( `` cia stooges ** ? 
  ** brainwashed by nato ** ? 
  ** '' ) are one clue , then the phrase `` yeah of course '' ( often used in a sarcastic way ) , followed by an even more obviously sarcastic phrase - `` because eastern europeans are too stupid to want a better future for themselves , someone has to be pulling their strings ... '' , followed by what he really feels about this - `` urgh '' - which is a common way of expressing disgust . 
  or do you think he is saying that all eastern europeans are stupid ? 
  ( hint : he is not ) unless i 'm very much mistaken , all the signs are there . 
  do n't let too many russian speaking people who identify themselves as ` ethnic russians ' settle in your country . 
  i think you failed to pick up on the sarcasm there . 
  this should be entered as their next eurovision song contest entry . 
  i heard there are moves afoot to [ remedy this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25534110 ), 
  say it is n't so : /, 
  i 've never been to manchester . 
  uk ( outside of northern ireland ) police do n't carry guns normally . 
  the last time i had anything to do with them ( on an autobahn in the '80s ) they were pretty scary . 
  also it was the first time i saw someone who was n't in the military wearing a gun . 
  or perhaps toss off a stiff email ? 
  truly this is globalisation gone bonkers . 
  empty words . 
  she would do better to start to outline how germany would reduce dependence on russian gas . 
  it 's a shame the uk does n't have a similar law . 
  yes , as mentioned , most of these are foreign students . 
  the irish are very sensitive about this . 
  i have no problem with it , and i 've heard dutch people have no problem with that either . 
  it 's only when people 's identity is under threat , or there is history of conflict and the misnomer feels like an insult when they care about such nuances . 
  such as ireland for example . 
  who 's ` we ' . 
  speak for yourself . 
  ok , so 1 in 4 postgrads are chinese ... 1 in 5 people in the * world * are chinese . 
  great arguments . 
  perfect . 
  what were you saying about the quality of this sub ? 
  there is no contradiction here .
