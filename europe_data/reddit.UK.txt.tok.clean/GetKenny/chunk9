  having a way of life that neighbouring countries want is not the same as ` pressing ' . 
  i would have thought this was obvious . 
  i do n't see anyone saying ` we in the west ' are guilt free . 
  russia 's actions should be judged by itself , marching into another country 's sovereign territory and making a land-grab . 
  the historical context here is russian imperialism , and grabbing countries from down the barrel of a gun . 
  the west is not pressing anywhere . 
  do n't blame it for offering a better way of life that countries want to enjoy as well . 
  this has nothing to do with the usa . 
  do n't try to make it about the usa . 
  it 's even worse in / r/worldnews, 
  achievement unlocked . 
   lol ? 
  leopards rarely change their spots . 
  if anything europe has trusted them too much , and has sleep-walked into a potentially abusive relationship , mostly regarding reliance on russia for gas , which most european leaders now realise was a mistake because it has made us vulnerable . 
  i think that coming from comfortable western european democracies , it 's easy for us to ignore the plight suffered by ex soviet countries so recently living under the jackboot of russian imperialism . 
  if you look at the reactions of those countries to recent events , they are not so ready to portray the russians as the victims of an overly negative press . 
  i know , russia is so misunderstood . 
  if everyone would just do what russia wants they would n't need to use guns at all . 
  such is life * sigh * . 
  if europe was interfering , it was with the promise of trade agreements , and eventual membership of the eu , after having the agreement of the majority of ukrainans . 
  russia did it literally down the barrel of a gun . 
  it 's almost like ... being trapped in a time warp . 
  apparently . 
  king ? 
  [ ... and then a step to the right ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zanho6wn1h4 ), 
  i 'm all for transparency , but i think this is is only a potential problem , not an actual one right now , and only a republican or otherwise staunch anti-royalist would see this is as such . 
  if people in power in parliament are putting too much weight to a ` nod and a wink ' from charles , then they can be reigned in by the others there who are n't under the ` royal spell ' . 
   a buckingham palace spokeswoman said : `` it is a long established convention that the queen is asked by parliament to provide consent to those bills which parliament has decided would affect crown interests . 
  the sovereign has not refused to consent to any bill affecting crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers . '', 
   a spokesman for prince charles said : `` in modern times , the prince of wales has never refused to consent to any bill affecting duchy of cornwall interests , unless advised to do so by ministers . 
  every instance of the prince 's consent having been sought and given to legislation is a matter of public record . '', 
  wrong . 
  it 's funny how you could hardly contain your glee at the prospect though , 
  the uk monarchy has n't vetoed anything for a long time . 
  if they tried , there would very likely be rapidly emplaced ` constitutional changes ' . 
  welshdwarf and magadget have been on the funny fags . 
  whatever gave you that idea ? 
  did i miss something ? 
  they made hay , but then the sun went in . 
  war is hilarious .

  so obscenely inappropriately named . 
  it 's the human condition to allow yourself to be trolled by someone with troll in his username . 
  but it 's not unconfirmed hearsay . 
  if as in this case , all they are doing is gathering news and regurgitating it verbatim , i do n't really see the problem . 
  i could have quoted one of dozens of sources all with the same report from the original source , which was cited on the zero hedge article . 
  you did n't need a crystal ball to guess that invasion was a possibility . 
  not really . 
  the question is is it real or not ? . 
  lol . 
  actually it came from a twitter post .

  if zerohedge is just a news gatherer , why do you think it has no credibility ?

  could you clue us in ?

  i suppose old habits die hard . 
  he is ex kgb after all - raised during the cold war , with the iron curtain , the velvet glove in an iron fist , and negotiation only from a position of strength . 
  the idea of soft power must seem alien to such a man . 
  it was interesting and a little alarming to hear merkel 's reaction after having spoken to him on the phone , saying he was ` living in another world ' , in other words losing touch with reality . 
  that alone does not make him an idiot . 
  thank you , kind stranger . 
  why should i care ? 
  it 's gone way beyond the onion now . 
  similar in some ways to scotland . 
  if the majority there truly want to , why would you stop them ? 
  wow . 
  amazing engineering . 
   hanged by the generals . 
  i totally misread that first time . 
  passive is the best kind of aggression . 
  it 's a quote by sherlock holmes , written by sir arthur conan doyle , so yes , a posh voice is best , 
  eliminate the impossible , and what 's left , however unlikely , must be the truth . 
  i was talking about tying differing economies together , rather than the euro 's performance against other currencies . 
  it could be worse . 
  that comment made you look totally ignorant about the conversation . 
  now hop off . 
  kunts . 
  do n't waste any more of your valuable time then . 
  i would engage , but your username indicates that would be pointless . 
  maybe i should have left netherlands out so you could be in the etc. 
  but seriously the core of europe is getting hard to define these days . 
  bulgaria is still hungover from the [ soviet union . 
  ] ( http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116035/bulgarias-european-union-membership-has-hurt-country ), 
  it might have worked if it only included a core of a few few nations like france germany , netherlands ( ? 
  but tying germany to greece for example always looked like a stupid thing to do . 
  i mean it was more like wishful thinking that it would all somehow turn out ok in the end than good planning . 
  they wanted it to happen so badly they even cooked the books to make it look like countries like greece and ireland were ready .
