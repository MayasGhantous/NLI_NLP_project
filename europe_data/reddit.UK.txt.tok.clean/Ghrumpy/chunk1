[ oxford 's ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/life ) primary definition does :  ** life ** * noun * the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter , including the capacity for growth , reproduction , functional activity , and continual change preceding death . 
  [ collins ' ] ( https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/life ) too :  ** life ** is the quality which people , animals , and plants have when they are not dead , and which objects and substances do not have . 
  the word ` life ' has many definitions for many different concepts though . 
  by saying for example `` battery life '' you 're using the word to describe a different concept than what / u/pm _ me_ur_limericks is talking about . 
  i think it begins with colon , and ends with ialism ... 
  there have historically also been other writing systems , latin just `` won '' . 
  and malay for example can still be written with the latin , arabic , and thai alphabets . 
  not if you 're only comparing shapes . 
  and if you start comparing phonetic values it gets very difficult , very quick . 
  just look at letters such as ` r ' , ` j' , ` v ' ... in different languages , or even just dialects . 
  ` j' is also not present in some latin alphabets , like for latin itself . 
  other letters commonly not part are w , x , q etc. 
  the one in op is the iso basic latin alphabet . 
  and \u00cb can also be found in some latin alphabets ( not the same pronunciation as cyrillic , but considering the image in op have \u03a1 and p as the same , i assume it 's by shape only ) . 
  the latin alphabet here also means `` iso basic latin alphabet '' ( or english , malay , etc. ) . 
  as i assume everyone here knows there is n't just one latin alphabet . 
  everything from rotokas ' twelve lettered to hungarian 's 44 are `` latin alphabets '' . 
  latin itself is different from iso basic latin . 
  that 's a cunt move , mate . 
  and * catalonian * can me used for that , they 're interchangeable . 
  i 'm just saying it is n't wrong in english , nothing more . 
  ... which can also be referred to as catalonian . 
  as i said , the terms can be used interchangeably . 
  also , op did write `` catalonian * / valencian * '' . 
  if they were referring to the language as a whole without distinguishing varieties , they would n't need to specify valencian either . 
  so i 'm not sure i agree with you on that one . 
  * catalonian * is n't wrong in english . 
  it most often refers to the specific variety spoken in catalonia as opposed to * catalan * which frequently also includes valencian etc. , but the terms can be used interchangeably . 
  * catalan * is more commonly used for the language but * catalonian * is n't wrong . 
  you can see it described in the [ dictionary ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/catalonian ) . 
  i well aware it is . 
  and i know what it means in other languages , that 's also why i know it 's a false friend that i 've seen many misuse when speaking english . 
  i 'm was n't criticising , i just wanted to inform anyone who may not have known that it does n't mean the same thing in english . 
   give up their own valuta just in case you did n't know , the common english term is * currency * . 
  ` valuta ' refers to the comparative value of a currency and is quite uncommon . 
   axis ( axi ? 
  axis ' ? 
  axes . 
  i know what you think , but i 'm not gimli . 
  it 's just a homograph . 
  how is it `` retarded '' ? 
  they 're not used as if they 're the same , the technical * drinking * age is n't talked about at all . 
  it 's not ever relevant to discuss . 
  to be fair i think there are few americans who wait until 21 for their first drink , from what i 've seen they seem to start at similar ages as europe . 
  if anything they seem to have a more hazardous binge drinking culture among teenagers than i 've seen from the continent . 
   there are many people posting here for whom english is not a first language yes , that is exactly why i wanted to point out what it refers to in english . 
  people who may not speak it natively may misinterpret it as a literal * drinking * age when that 's not what it means . 
   under 18 is allowed with a meal and with parents present ( i think ) [ it is . 
  ] ( https://www.gov.uk/alcohol-young-people-law ) 16 for licensed premises ( not spirits ) , 5 home . 
  that may be , but * ` drinking age ' * is a pretty standard term in english . 
  for the uk i suppose the legal * drinking * age would technically be five , as it 's illegal to give alcohol to anyone younger than that . 
  but that 's not what we refer to as `` drinking age '', 
  `` drinking age '' can also mean what you 're referring to as `` purchasing age '' , it 's not wrong . 
  [ oxford ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/drinking_age ) :  ** drinking age ** * noun *  the minimum age at which it is legal for a person to buy alcohol . 
  i know close to nothing about basque . 
  i know it 's a language isolate with no relatives , but i do n't even know how you lot say `` hi '' or what it sounds like . 
  i do know it 's not related to german compounds anyway . 
  yeah i know , a lot of languages do . 
  i was just responding as to why german does so i only found reason to mention the germanic ones . 
  agglutinative languages are a subgroup of synthetic languages with derivational morphemes that are `` glued together '' like hungarian , japanese etc. , not german . 
  german 's a fusional language with moderate inflection . 
  while agglutinative languages use compounds , using compounds does not make a language agglutinative . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i initially wrote it with the `` english also has ... '' - part first and had `` in all ( ? ), 
  * other * germanic languages '' . 
  i just confused my brain rephrasing it in a ninja edit . 
  i 've fixed it now . 
  thanks . 
  in almost all germanic languages ( german , dutch , swedish etc. ), 
  the standard is to write words that refer to one concept together . 
  take for example * `` press conference '' * , it 's one concept , so you ca n't take one of the words away and describe the same thing , as such you put them together as * pressconference * . 
  english also has compounds . 
  it 's just ( as usual ... ) very inconsistent and the usual standard is to write the words apart , but we have some . 
  blackboard , railway , football , etc. 
  i 'm well aware , that 's the very reason i specifically pointed out this was for english and not knowing the situation in norwegian . 
  the thing is terminology is difficult as every sovereign state runs differently and perceptions will therefore differ . 
  some languages do n't have a word for the `` united kingdom '' and uses to `` great britain '' for example . 
  technically this excludes northern ireland , but it 's not really incorrect as there is no `` uk '' . 
  but in english , scotland can , and is , most definitely a country . 
  but then i 've been told that `` country '' also carries connotations of sovereignty in american english . 
  it 's confusing . 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  to me it just requires autonomy , which scotland has more than most seem to realise . 
  but that 's good to know . 
  what do you call constituent countries then ? 
  like greenland , what is that referred to as being ? 
  and i 'm not saying it 's wrong , but do you have a dictionary that does define it as something sovereign ? 
  because neither cambridge nor oxford 's american dictionaries do . 
  all definitions i 've managed to find only gives it implications of autonomy , which scotland does meet . 
  yeah , i suppose . 
  still think it 's cheating more than just slightly , cheating * moderately * ... ? 
  i 'd say it 's cheating quite a bit . 
  by few definitions i know of would that be considered a complete sentence , unless it means something i do n't know in some language of course . 
  `` g\u00e5 . 
  '' , is cheating slightly in the sense it 's only one word , but at least it 's an imperative and clearly a sentence . 
  they are , per definition . 
  i was with you when you 're talking about what you 're considering different countries , that 's your perception and opinion . 
  i 'm fine with that . 
  but per definition * country * does simply mean `` an area of land with its own government '' in english . 
  scotland does .
