  as i said , it 's not perfect , but we do n't live in a perfect world , so instead of running away from problems while insulting everyone around us like an angsty 13 year old , we should stay united and confront these issues head on with our european allies . 
  wait a minute though , only 92 peers are hereditary now , so it 's not like * most * of them are hereditary . 
  although i do agree that 92 is still quite a lot i just like to be pedantic . ^ help ^ me, 
  i must point out however , as an anglo-italian who has lived in both countries , the anglican church has much less power and influence over the general populace , and even if there is n't any separation , i 'd still argue that in many senses the uk is more lay than italy . 
   no , i consider the church an antidote to radical politics . 
  but just like you said , since the centre is occupied by the church , for too long ; the national politics are inevitably radicalised . 
   mussolini is a pragmatic man just like hitler , and a pargmatic man knew the church - rather than a useless , fractured national government - is he 's best tool to get control of the state and its people . 
  i wish that was true , but unfortunately i know too many people in italy who consider themselves radical catholics and at the same time venerate mussolini . 
  fascism in italy is different from national socialism in germany , it 's not always seen as something that we should be rid of , and there 's a fairly large portion of the population who is pretty sympathetic towards mussolini because `` he was a real italian/catholic/politician / leader ! '' . 
  they 'll ignore the fact that he did it exclusively for political reasons and they 'll just keep on repeating to themselves `` but * il dvce * was the b-best ! '' . 
  and did i mention most of these people are n't horrible edgy teen skin heads ? 
  oh no , they can be actually quite nice people in their fifties just like they can be 17-18 year olds who feel quite close to the catholic church ( this is based on my own personal experience ) . 
  the fact that fascism was less racist and more nationalistic is both a blessing and a curse , on the one hand , it does n't necessarily preach hate , but on the other hand it also makes it more attractive since more people can relate to it . 
  disclaimer : as you might have deduced , i have no love for fascists and fundamentalist catholics , but such is life . 
  i 'm not going to argue with that , however even sanders and donald trump are n't the biggest russo-phobes in america , i mean , trump 's being supported by putin practically , and sanders declared the other day that north korea is the biggest threat to the us . 
  so while i agree that lots of people may not be as rational as you and i ( not trying to boast or anything , it 's just that i think , like you , that a nuclear war is not the rational choice ) , i think that most americans in high places are n't too russo-phobic . 
  however we have yet to see what will happen , but in the meantime i 'll hope for the best . 
  i guess it 's like britain 's relationship with ireland , we do n't hate the irish and the irish government , quite the contrary actually , however we have no love for the ira ( provisional/continuity ira and all those other extremists ) . 
  i imagine the same thing goes for turkey and the pkk , please correct me if i 'm mistaken . 
   you should look up the history of how the us starts wars . 
  it 's always provoke , provoke , provoke and then `` omg they attacked us they are evil we must invade ! '', 
  and even some of the `` attacks '' are fabricated . 
  that 's a rather debatable claim ( the us has started wars like this granted , but they have hardly ever used article 5 to that end ) and you should also consider that the us right now does n't want to go to war with another nuclear power , since that could potentially make a regional conflict escalate to an all-out nuclear war . 
  oh i see , and by the way , i was n't criticising / u/w4hammer , i was merely asking him a question since i was a bit puzzled as i 'm not a turk/kurd/expert on that matter . 
  still , thank you and / u/w4hammer for explaining it to me !, 
   which are trained by turkey . 
  but are n't they kurdish ? 
  i must be missing something here , because turkey training kurds makes no sense to me . 
  to everyone who thinks this will drag nato into a war : ** it will not ** . 
  article 5 of nato specifically states that nato will intervene on a member country 's side only if the nato country in question is not the aggressor and is being attacked . 
  in this case turkey would be by itself since the turkish government initiated hostilities with syria . 
  plus , it 's not like russia or iran are in any position to start a war against 2 powerful countries like sa or turkey , so even if article 5 did n't exist it most likely would n't be a problem given russia 's unwillingness and inability to start a long-term war . 
  tl ; dr article 5 says that turkey is on its own , but it 's not like russia or any other country right now could invade it , so ww3 is n't in sight . 
   like the hundreds and hundreds of trillions itl for the cassa del mezzogiorno ? 
  a big part of the southern italy 's problems is up to local politicians and the presence of a massive extortion to small businesses , even though the central government has a big share of the responsability as well , alright . 
  i never said that was n't the case , however , as / u/elmer _ the_arse said , it takes two to tango , and both the central and the local government/s are to blame in this case . 
  i agree , russia at the moment would n't be able to sustain a long term war with two relatively powerful nations . 
  oh so you were talking about gladio and all the other operations then , in that case i agree with you , i 'd just misinterpreted your comment . 
   is kept unstable by the usa . 
  are you saying that the mezzogiorno issue is being caused by the us ? 
  because if so i can tell you that unfortunately that 's not true . 
  the only country responsible for the north-south divide is italy and italy alone , and it was caused by the italian government 's incapacity ( or maybe unwillingness , but that 's speculation ) to solve the problem . 
   u guys would love to think that a muslim majority country must be an undemocratic dictatorship . 
  you are turkish , you should know better than anyone else here what erdogan has been doing . 
  whether he 's an `` islamist '' is debatable and i agree with you on that , but you ca n't deny that he 's been doing some pretty shady stuff lately , what with censorship , threats , mysterious disappearances etc. 
  i 'm not saying turkey is a shitty country , quite the contrary actually , but erdogan is far from a democratic leader who is tarnishing turkey 's reputatio with his quasi-autocratic government , and that seems pretty undeniable to me . 
  no , because it will have been started by turkey , thus making turkey the aggressor , and if turkey was the aggressor then article 5 would n't apply to turkey in this case . 
  oh , i did n't know that !, 
  i wonder if the same thing goes for florence ? 
  when i was young in italy people used to call me * biondo * ( blonde ) even though my hair was light brown , whereas in britain all my family and friends thought it was dark brown . 
  it 's funny how the perception of one 's hair colour changes from country to country . 
  yeah , the dact that there are n't any sources is kind of sketchy too . 
  i 'm not saying it 's bs , but i am going to give it the benefit of the doubt . 
  oh i bet he is , and i feel sorry for him . 
  the description of the incident however made it sound hilarious . 
   mr. kasyanov told the interfax news agency that men `` of a non-slavic nationality , '' a common euphemism here for chechens , set upon him in a moscow restaurant , yelled death threats , ** smeared the cake on his head and then left ** . 
  mr. kasyanov served as prime minister during president vladimir v. putin 's first term before joining the opposition . 
  what happened is unfortunate and worrying , but the cake smearing part ? 
  just thinking about it makes me chuckle . 
   depends what you define unhelpful as , if you think it was unhelpful to not be overly receptive to a british state that was itself involved in murders , bombings , and collusion in terrorism then no , ireland was n't very helpful . 
  why would ireland be helpful to a state that was unlawfully killing irish people ? 
  i 'm sure you already realise it but i just thought i 'd point it out so that people do n't get the wrong end of the stick : remember , during the troubles both the ira ( the irish ) and the british army/loyalist paramilitaries committed heinous acts towards innocent civilians , and we should always make sure we condemn both sides so as to not forget what happened and to commemorate the british and irish victims of these horrifying events . 
  also , by admitting that both sides did bad things , we make it easier to put what happened behind us and to start treating each other like the neighbours we are , without resentment and hate ( most people do n't harbour much hate in both countrie as far as i know , however there are still extremists on both sides that threaten our coexistence ) . 
  that does n't mean you get off without having to serve a sentence though , you still have to go to a clinc ( psychiatric `` hospital '' ) to receive therapy and to be checked , which is sort of like going to prison . 
   refugees welcome i never meant saying refugees welcome was bad , pardon my wording , i meant the refugees welcome crowd , who consider any economic migrant a refugee for some reason , which you also acknowledged in the fourth paragraph of your comment . 
   but no , you get top-voted comments like `` do n't let them in '' or `` do n't let single men in '' or `` do n't let muslims in '' or whatever . 
  that 's what you get when you have a lot of angry people . 
  i agree with you in this case , however top-voted comments here are n't indicative of what the situation really is like in europe , i mean , just the fact that people here have the benefit of anonimity makes them more prone to shitposting or being more extreme than they would in real life . 
  that may as well be true , however we ca n't be sure yet , and if handled properly and not let off the leash , so to speak , i believe that pegida could prove to be useful and not damaging to europe . 
   no matter how calm and normal looking this looks , let us not forget that these people represent an extreme . 
  extremes are never a good solution , i believe in middle ground . 
  i agree with this particular statement of yours , however as i said previously pegida is useful because they put pressure on the german government and might eventually force it to take a firmer stance regarding the issue europe is facing . 
  i have no love for their leaders , but as you said yourself , both sides in this case are rather extreme , and without a group to counterbalance one of these extremist groups ( be it far left or far right ) , we risk being at the mercy of the aforementioned group . 
  ( i 'm not saying that we need nazis to counterbalance communists , so before anyone puts words in my mouth you have been warned . ), 
   the problem is not only that there are some xenophobes and racists among them , it 's that they are trying to appeal to them . 
  if you invite speakers like akif pirin\u00e7ci who make their extremist remarks and get applause for this , you really ca n't claim that they are just a bunch of concerned citizens . 
  you have a point , although i must point out that the leaders of pegida are different from most of their supporters . 
  i also do n't understand why inviting a speaker like akif pirin\u00e7ci ( who i do n't like either ) is any different from inviting a far left `` refugees welcome '' ( aka any migrant from all over the world who wants to come here no matter what their criminal record or intentions are ) , in my opinion both these types of people are dangerous , however i do n't see why one group is seen as acceptable and another is n't . 
   then there is the issue with bachmann and his criminal records , an investigation against him that is currently ungoing and a self-portrait dressed up as hitler . 
  no wonder some founding members of pegida left . 
  prince harry dressed up as hitler too , and he is by no means a nazi , sure , it was a very stupid thing to do and i 'll always condemn it , but it 's not necessarily tantamount to being a nazi . 
   if you are not willing to distance yourself from right-wingers , you will alienate `` normal people '' and only get the very angry or very right-wingers . 
  i mean look at the afd . 
  they are going the same way , ousting the moderates like lucke and moving further to the right . 
  what 's wrong with right wingers ? 
  i consider myself a right winger and i 'm far more tolerant than most left wingers . 
  i imagine in this case you meant * far right * , so i 'll answer to you bearing in mind that you meant this ( i hope ) . 
  i personally have the same reservations about pegida that you do , however i think that they 're useful for pointing out the public discontent that exists in europe at the moment , which too many times is neglected by * liberals * and the government , and they can serve as a wake up call for europe . 
  also , just to clarify , i 'll post pegida 's main points , which were provided by / u/whereworm : * approves the right of asylum for war refugees and politically persecuted people . 
  * mentions zero tolerance towards criminal refugees and immigrants . 
  * indicates that pegida opposes any radicalism , whether religious or politically motivated . 
  edit : regarding the moustache incident , i found this on wikipedia :  a few weeks later , bachmann was reinstated as a co-leader following a vote . 
  the s\u00e4chsische zeitung later discovered the picture to be a forgery , reporting that a moustache was added after the photo was taken . 
  wow , they really do look like a violent bunch of unorganised criminal neo-nazis ! / s i do n't understand , why do these groups always get portrayed by media outlets as the `` bad guys '' ? 
  i understand some of them might be neo-nazis or xenophobic people , but to me it looks like a bunch of normal people who are fed up with what 's going on and want their government , which is meant to represent them , to do something about it . 
  that does n't seem unreasonable if you ask me . 
  also , lots of left-wing groups have criminals and bad people in them , but somehow they often get overlooked just because they are n't nazis or * xenophobes * . 
  people are only talking about this because it * was n't * an immigrant who did it , otherwise i can assure you that most people and news agencies would 've dismissed it as a drunk guy being a drunk guy . 
  remember , propaganda works both ways . 
  oh i get it now , thanks for the explanation !,
