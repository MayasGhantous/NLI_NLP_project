  oh ok , if that 's what you meant then i completely agree , sorry for jumping to conclusions !, 
  i know that , but / u/romeneverfell was talking about the present , not the past , so that 's why i made the comment above . 
  oh dear , i must n't have noticed !, 
  ( bad internet ) i guess they 'd have a point then , but so weak seems like a rather broad statement to me . 
  but why do you consider italy weak ? 
  i must admit italy might not be the most powerful nation in the world , but it is far from weak . 
   we are always beautiful ~ ~ when we drink ~ ~ . 
  ftfy, 
  as i said in one of my previous posts , do n't judge people based on their government , or else you 're probably an idiot . 
  putin however is like some comic book villain by now though , just look at all the things he does , he 's basically just provoking the west at russia 's , syria 's , georgia 's , ukraine 's , turkey 's etc. 
  expense . 
  well , i guess it 's better than * nothing * . 
  but do we really get that many more benefits than you ? 
  in my humble opinion if the us did n't side with europe and instead opposed it , not only would america lose four of the most powerful countries in the world as allies ( germany , france , uk , italy ) , but they 'd also lose a lot of power projection and military bases which are useful for keeping russia 's expansionist tendencies in check ( and to a certain degree they also send a message to china ) . 
  i 'm not saying europe gets the short end of the stick , it 's just that i think that the eu-usa relationship benefits us equally . 
  to be fair , once you 've lived in another country for a while you understand just how good british tv is despite its flaws ( the bbc in particular ) . 
  of course it has its pros and cons , and does sometimes produce boring reality shows , but when you see programmes like hignfy , * sherlock * , * bad education * etc. 
  ( i 'm not implying everyone likes the aforementioned series , i 'm just stating that they are popular and that i like them ) you understand just how lucky we are to have television channels like the bbc and channel 4 , which excel compared to some other countries ' channels ( in my case italian tv , which is pretty ludicrous if you ask me ) . 
  but we should be able to set aside these differences and cooperate , because if we stay divided we 'll only become more and more irrelevant on the international stage , and that 's what world powers like china ( not sure about the us ) want , because they fear a united europe , which would be a far more powerful and rich state than any current world power . 
  do people in the south call him babbo natale too ? 
  i always thought ( having lived in tuscany ) that babbo was an exclusively tuscan word that no one else used . 
  i also knew that babbo in sicily is used as a way of telling someone they 're stupid , can you confirm or deny what i just said ? 
  you 'd better copyright it before someone steals it . ^ like ^ me . 
   burlesquoni please tell me you did that on purpose . 
  please , it would just be pure genius if you did . 
  having mental issues does n't necessarily mean that one ca n't be a good leader ( and no , hitler is n't an example of an effective `` mad '' leader ) , in fact someone can be a complete psychopath ( not saying that putin is ) and still be a shrewd politician and diplomat . 
  wow , this is probably the best answer i 've received !, 
  now that i think about what you said about italians , in particular making friends in pre existing circles is extremely true in my case , since i met a lot of my italian friends through people i already knew . 
  that makes three of us who want a recount , we should start a petition !, 
  op is an ** anglophobe ** !, 
  i looked at op 's comment in this thread and apparently people who had transylvania , england and other more specific flairs were counted too , so that makes sense . 
  you need to pick a flair , you can do so by looking under the map of europe in this subreddit and clicking on the `` edit '' button next to your name , after doing that just pick the union jack ( or the english/welsh etc. 
  flag ) and you should have your flair . 
  to be fair , i am half italian and bilingual too , so following italian politics is pretty easy ( and interesting ) for me . 
  yeah , i guess that 's why in this chart there are less british redditors per 1 million inhabitants . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  it never rains in england ! ^ / s, 
  pardon my bad wording , by social i just meant interaction in general , and social interaction can be achieved online too , and while totally different from real life conversations , online ones still count as such . 
  plus , i know lots of people in italy who spend a considerable amount of time online , only not on sites like reddit but on social media like instagram , facebook or whatsapp , so that is n't totally true either . 
  i guess what i was trying to say was that i was surprised that not many italians used reddit , when generally people in italy like to start up conversations , and people who are social in real life usually are on the internet too . 
  well , you can be social online too , i mean there 's a difference between being social and having a social life , to be social you just have to communicate , be it online or in real life . 
  damn you , you european tyrant !, 
  still , i imagined that we would be a bit higher up the chart . 
  then again , i 've never been good at maths . 
  yeah , that 's true , plus most italians just stick to facebook to discuss any sort of topic ( i love seeing the comments some people make on salvini 's facebook statuses after something regarding migrants happens in italy , it 's just * qualunquismo * at its finest ) . 
  we ** need ** a recount , britain is second to no one ! ^ r-right ? 
  as far as i 'm concerned , when it comes to reddit and other popular sites , italians are surprisingly slow to start using them * en masse * , i wonder why it 's like that , especially considering that italians are seen as such social people . 
  it depends on whether they counted english , welsh , scottish and northern irish flairs as british , because if they did n't that would explain a lot . 
  edit : read how it was done , and apparently we were taken into consideration , so i guess there just are n't that many of us on / r/europe . 
  but is n't xenophobia tantamount to racism nowadays ? 
  i must admit i have not , however as i said before you ca n't just generalise like that , plus if they 're allowed to run in the elections they ca n't have anything xenophobic in it . 
  ( i 'm not saying there are n't racist people there , however i 'm sure a lot of upstanding people are in that party ) . 
  i-i 'm sorry , i 'll show everyone my glorious anglo genes right now !, 
  i do n't think all their voters are like that but after all you 're right , this debate deserves its own thread . 
  it was me , england , all along !, 
  ** muhahahahahaha **, 
  why are people who vote for fn gullible ? 
  i for one would n't vote for them , but you ca n't just dismiss all the people that do as gullible , that would be just a generalisation . 
  however i must apologise for implying that you thought he was a racist , i should 've thought twice before writing that comment . 
  yeah , what a racist scumbag . ^ / s, 
  i find myself in complete agreement with you , however by playing devil 's advocate i was trying to say that some people , if not done right , might perceive assimilation as something that has been forced upon them , and not as an opportunity ( which is what it really is ) . 
  out of all these names i do n't see le pen 's , the leader ergo the representative of the party , plus , like in ukip , in parties like these there are bound to be a few rotten apples ( just like every party has , look at the conservatives and labour in britain ) , but that still does n't mean that everyone in fn is a racist bigot ( just look at all the muslims that voted for them ) . 
  disclaimer : i for one do not support le pen , however i am in favour of democracy and in this case the use of * slander * , because that is what mr.valls is doing , to get rid of an opponent is , in my opinion , very undemocratic, 
  do n't get me wrong , i agree with you completely , after all , i do consider myself a conservative . 
  i also think that europe and european identity is secular above all else , and that christianity is the most compatible religion with european values . 
  that said i think that it 's wrong to force a conversion , and when i say that i 'm not implying that you said it but i 'm just reiterating the point i made earlier, 
  of course , however i was thinking more about people who wanted to integrate and not be seen as outsiders ( because let 's be honest , if you do n't consider yourself european , i 'm not going to either ) . 
  assimilation might do it , but as you said you 'd be depriving someone of their identity . 
  ca n't one be christian and european , jewish and european or muslim and european ? 
  religious and national identity are n't mutually exclusive in my opinion . 
  those were n't even integration problems , jews had been in europe for over 500 years by that point and had completely integrated into european society . 
   but he said that these voters were nevertheless `` voting for a party that is anti-semitic , racist , which does not like the republic and which is also cheating the french . '' i 'm going have to ask for a source to back up those claims mr. valls , you ca n't call a party anti-semitic just because the leader 's father is an anti-semite and say that they are racist just because they oppose immigration . 
  i do n't even support fn but this sort of scaremongering is ludicrous and nothing more than a weak attempt at undermining le pen 's integrity . 
  that 's even worse . 
  of course you ca n't ban just burqas , that would be intolerant , i do still oppose them , but who am i to impose my desires onto other people ? 
  what i was trying to say was that just because of your beliefs you should n't be exempt from some laws , especially when these laws are in place to protect the public . 
  did n't you know that all britons are euro-sceptic ? 
  i feel sorry for you , i really do . / s, 
  i agree , it 's ridiculous that they get a pass just because of their traditions . 
  i hate to sound like a populist but in this case `` when in rome do as the romans do '' seems like a more than appropriate saying , especially considering that we do n't go to countries like saudi arabia and demand that they legalise gay marriages or give women the same rights as men just because it 's like that here , so i do n't see why we should do the same , but i digress . 
  what i wanted to say is that do n't mind it if you follow your traditions , so long as your traditions do n't interfere with our laws and safety . 
  ca n't we just ban saudi arabia ? 
  oh yeah i know that , it 's just that you said motorways so i thought you meant autostrade . 
  so much this , being bilingual i realised a few years ago how lucky i was to be a native english speaker , it 's just * so * convenient for so many reasons that i could n't possibly list them all in a single comment . 
  b-but all the ukrainian volunteers are fascists , and the russ ... 
  i mean separatists , are all good , i promise ! / s, 
  wow , they must be * really * incompetent to be worse than anas . 
  wait , did n't anas take care of motorways in italy ? 
  do n't listen to people who say stuff like `` swedes are cucks lol '' , that 's / pol / tier stuff and does n't belong in a civil conversation , plus , the situation in sweden is n't too different from the one in the rest of europe , but people like to ignore this and just jump on the bandwagon . 
  anyway , someone who hates a country because of their government is an idiot regardless of what his reasons might be , and you should discard their opinion immediately . 
  however i must also point out that what you said to the american guy ( i ca n't be bothered to re-type his username ) is n't the best thing to tell someone if you want to start a serious discussion . 
  tl ; dr i understand your frustration and believe me , i empathise with you and i understand where you 're coming from ( you ca n't imagine how many people say stuff like londonistan seriously ) , but i also think that you should n't be too aggressive towards people , since that 's never a good way to start a civil conversation . 
  no one hates sweden , well i do n't at least , but many people , like me for instance , dislike the government that is in power right now . 
  when unclesneakyfingers said sweden i 'm pretty sure he meant the government , and in my opinion he 's right , and even if lofven retracted his statement , he still should n't have made it in the first place , since politics are n't a game and when you 're a major political figure you ca n't be so irresponsible as to say that stabbings are n't acts of terrorism , even if you correct yourself later . 
  you 're completely right , and i 'm sorry if i trivialised the whole affair . 
  however , to the general public , all the events that took place this year seem to be attributable to the eu ( and of course germany , because eu = germany of course / s ) , because of the schengen and dublin treaties , and merkel 's 180 , followed by another 180 ( a 360 ? ), 
  this year . 
  oh , do n't get me wrong , i 'm aware both of that and the fact that merkel is popular ( i personally do n't dislike her , i just believe that she could 've handled the situation in a better way , but i also understand that it 's not all up to her , so basically i guess you could just say i know that the situation is complicated ) . 
  but many europeans who live in border countries feel that countries like germany and france are being hypocritical , since when one of the former countries decides not to let refugees in they get criticised , but once the immigrants have entered the border countries other eu members like germany and france do n't let them in and make states like greece and hungary keep these refugees because of the dublin agreement ( see french border patrols on the franco-italian border , and no , i 'm not saying this is always the case , but it does sometimes happen ) . 
  as far as i 'm concerned the schengen treaty is a double-edged sword , sure , it 's quite charming for us europeans to be able to travel freely from one country in the eu to another , but it also causes problems , especially when it comes to immigration .
