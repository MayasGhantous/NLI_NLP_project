  i dont get where you 've got this idea from . 
  the only thing the queen does is give royal assent , which she will give to * every * piece of legislation that is thrown at her , else she 'll soon find herself being voted out of power by parliament . 
  by the way , the leading ideology here is parliamentary sovereignty , which upholds that the elected officials in the house of commons ( not the house of lords ) are above every other body . 
  the judiciary can not even shoot down bills , and neither can the house of lords . 
  they can only give advice . 
  the queen is the head of state , not the head of government . 
  shes not a tyrant , and she doesnt have the power to be a tyrant . 
  many look up to her as the essence of the british character , and an anchor of tradition . 
  i dont think you fully understand how our monarchy works, 
  would n't change a thing, 
  the yorkshire/lancashire rivalry,

   do you think your country is `` great '' ? 
  clues in the name . 
  proud of your accomplishments ? 
  depends . 
  britain has has a huge impact on the world , with plenty of good and bad . 
  a lot of africa and india is arguably worse off than they would have been if we would n't have got involved . 
  however i do think there have been a decent of positives resulting from our countries actions . 
  the usa , canada , australia etc would all never had existed had it not been for this country . 
  it 's a complicated issue though , the legacy of the empire . 
  crisis ? 
  what crisis ? 
  p o t n o o d l e, 
  could you be a bit more specific ? 
  many . 
  north v south ( industrial north vs clerical south ) east v west ( lancashire vs yorkshire ) england v scotland / wales / ireland working class v middle class v upper class, 
  the government is attempting to kill the nhs ( as in , they 're not just inept ), 
  was n't there white paint on the side of the limo ? 
  as in , white paint from another car ? 
  depends on the school . 
  i remember a few pupils that got habitually bullied , and not a whole lot was done . 
  either they did n't report it , or the school was powerless to stop it , i ca n't remember . 
  i was n't talking about that . 
  where did a teacher and his son come into this ? 
  `` the district governor of achin , ismail shinwari , said security forces had recovered 92 bodies , none of them civilians '' i mean , where are you getting this information from ? 
  source ? 
  is n't that from the bus bombing ? 
  there 's really no need . 
  we have a professional , trained army . 
  conscripting any old cunt would ruin the quality of the army , especially if people did n't want to be there . 
  it would also damage our already poor education culture , setting people back a year . 
  if it was to be introduced though , it should really be gated with a fitness evaluation of some sort . 
  ha ha ha what, 
  have you heard what amber rudd said ?

  i went to parliament last week and viewed both houses during debate . 
  commons was quite empty , only around 20-30 people in there , but lords was noticeably more full . 
  you mean yorkshire right ? 
  [ st pancras ] ( http://stpancras.com/media/1334/external_night2.jpg?anchor=center&amp;mode=crop&amp;width=994&amp;height=586&amp;rnd=130941405550000000 ) in london is probably my [ favourite ] ( http://cdn.londonandpartners.com/l-and-p/assets/convention_bureau/46702-640x360-st-pancras-station_edit_ns.jpg ) , that i can think of . 
  other buildings like the palace of westminster , various churches , the british museum and even the cheesegrater are also quite pretty in my mind .

  [ mein f\u00fchrer ] ( http://www.counter-currents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/farage.jpg ), 
  i dont mind them as long as theyre done tastefully . 
  buildings like the gherkin , shard and cheese-grater are all nice , but the walkie-talkie and others , like those around the docklands , are quite ugly . 
  the labour party had adopted what would become the `` post-war consensus '' : - establishment of the welfare state - adoption of keynesian economic policy ( < 3 % unemployment , etc ) - creating a mixed economy - working closely with trade unions people liked this . 
  so they voted for this . 
  it helps too that the returning soldiers were idealistic about the future of britain , having seen the devastation in europe . 
  i think channel 4 changes its intro based on the days content .

  people probably voted leave because of that .

  i think your dog might have autism, 
  holy hell you 're actually serious . 
  i thought this was a troll . 
  just to put it into context how controversial she was , she got a state funeral in st pauls , while people in the north had street parties to celebrate . 
  essex ? 
  history, 
  ah yes , the socialist utopia of south yorkshire . 
  that 's still pretty funny, 
  the national cynicism . 
  it just seems like we the british enjoy being told the worst case scenario . 
  that and the fact that everyone gets so bloody worked up over trivial shit , and we seem to like that . 
  alan was a member of the labour party for like 20 years so it would be quite different . 
  satire of the_donald , similar to r/the _ alan, 
  i was thinking recently . 
  r/the _ alan, 
  following america into iraq . 
  literally the exact response of everyone present . 
  we had a group of gypsies move , uninvited , to one of my schools fields . 
  they lived in busted up caravans .

  aesthetically ? 
  probably us . 
  we have no cohesive planning laws in any cities and infrastructure is built willy-nilly all over the place with a disregard for how ugly the end product will be .
