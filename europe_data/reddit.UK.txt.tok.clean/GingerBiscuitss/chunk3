  yeah i know . 
  but there are so many ugly cities in this country . 
   other than your own hahahahaha, 
  i 'd say infrastructure . 
  - much of the rail infrastructure in the north was abandoned in the 80s and what was left often is n't electrified and usually runs old pacer trains . 
  - the vast majority of even the busiest motorways are still only 3 lanes . 
  - many sewers and such date from the victoriana era - there is not enough investment in building new infrastructure - not enough new housing is being built and to top it all off , the majority of it is just plain ugly . 
  we dont have a codified constitution , unlike most of europe . 
  * northern rail *, 
  thats irregardless of the point, 
  still not fair though , is it ? 
   who won fair and square with a minority vote ? 
  our system isnt much better either . 
  at the moment it would be battlefield 1 . 
  doing well is so satisfying . 
  the tsa . 
  experiments have shown them to be largely ineffective , and yet hours are wasted at airports for the sake of security theater . 
  belgium is the whole reason that britain joined the war ( to my understanding ), 
  they recently switched the grading system from a * - u , to a number system that goes from 1 to 8 . 
  i have absolutely no idea what the new scale implies and i feel sorry for anyone going through it . 
  just the one, 
  `` utopia avenue '', 
  hitler has only got one ball , g\u00f6ring has two but very small , himmler has something sim ` lar , but poor old goebbels has no balls at all . 
  hitler has only got one ball , the other is in the albert hall his mother , the dirty bugger , cut it off when he was small . 
  she threw it over west germany , it landed in the deep blue sea , the fishes got out their dishes , and had scallops and bollocks for tea . 
  [ its the end of the world as we know it ... ] ( http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/poundland-started-selling-things-more-12068587 ), 
   might wan na take a backseat on this one britain every . 
  single . 
  post, 
  but when did i say anything about that . 
  in all fairness , there 's reason to be salty - look at the pound . 
  they sorta-kinda ruined the iwm with that `` renovation '' they did a few years ago . 
  in my old history class there was a picture of her , with her eyes coloured in red and horns . 
  her name read : ~ ~ margret ~ ~ darth thatcher . 
  i live in south yorkshire . 
  peniston scunthorpe grimsby cockermouth, 
  probably the netherlands . 
  they seem like an all round decent place and the language would n't be too hard to learn . 
  bairn only elderly yorkshire nans use it . 
  it means child, 
  [ `` subdued '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja14bkuusms ), 
  corbyn will pop up in the news once a week . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st_paul%27s_tower ) , which overtook [ the arts tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arts_tower ) a few years ago . 
  the latter has one of the only remaining paternoster lift in the uk . 
  ... meadowhall ? 
  [ heres ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scelaxmcvis ) a video showing the old , strong yorkshire dialect that has all but died out . 
  it sounds almost scandinavian . 
  in the history course i took at gcse , we learnt more about european conflicts and domestic stuff like the home front rather than the empire . 
  although some mention of the empire did slip in here or there . 
  at a level , british history picks up in 51 , so it does n't really cover anything other than the suez crisis , deciding to mainly focus on , again , domestic issues . 
  we do however do american history 1860 till 1970 , which has some empire interwoven with it . 
  tl : dr the empire got glossed over . 
  uhm ... 
  that 's ours , you bastards !, 
  jesus , is corbyn trying to make himself unelectable ? 
  ~ ~ republican ~ ~ traitor movements ftfy, 
  the country is advanced , sure , but the people , not so much . 
  did you find out the hard way ? 
  there 's little eu flags on various signs around where i live . 
  mostly on the industrial / commercial centers that were joint funded by the eu and `` twinned with '' bits on town signs . 
  are you unhappy ? 
  come to rotherham !, 
  * it 's like you 're already dead *, 
  they should relegate political issues such as brexit to / r/ukpolitics, 
  sounds great , until you actually get here ... 
  i live in rotherham * killme *, 
  like drinking both tea and excessive amounts of alcohol . 
  being phased out by lad culture, 
  oh that 's fucking embarrassing, 
  oh yes, 
  r/unitedkingdom is just politics . 
  its shit . 
  the us of a. 
  much anglosphere, 
  cornish pasties . 
  so you shower with ice water ? 
  and never drink hot drinks ? 
  and your house is constantly freezing ? 
  yes ? 
  i know a fair few who much prefer coffee over tea . 
  the dirty heathens, 
  ~ ~ do n't mind me ~ ~, 
  - bad teeth - bad food - everyone drinks tea - we all either talk like the queen or oliver twist, 
  im from rotherham . 
  i 'd be insulted , but its true . 
  we have this problem . 
  most town and city centers were built in the 60 's as part of `` urban renewal '' plans that left monolithic shingle flats everywhere . 
  big cities , however , have replaced those neglected buildings with new ones that will probably suffer the same fate ; torn down in 50/60 years due to lack of foresight . 
  suddenly stop in the middle of the street to take photos of themselves in front of landmarks . 
  people love that, 
  didnt know the police here had a bad rep until now . 
  huh . 
  the man wore custom union jack shoes to a dinner party , days after `` sticking it to the rich elite '', 
  its not very good . 
  they dont even use the a , b , c system anymore . 
  kids from year 10 onwards use a generic number from 1-8 . 
  do i know which ones the best ? 
  fuck no !, 
  the schools themselves are often either rickety victorian schools that do n't get the maintenance they need , drab 60 's sprawls with moss everywhere or new shoddy installments with terrible planning and no longevity . 
  it does n't help that they are often chronically underfunded too .
