this should be a new action response in europe . 
  whenever there is a crisis or incident every country should immediately send 20 good men . 
  i love watching poles get butthurt over history . 
  no one died , no wars were started , both sides got their guys back , decent win for both sides . 
  this is over a year old .

  the posters are in an area where most people who go there are african or asian and to my mind they are there to put fear into people . '', 
  white said the posters should be removed `` as soon as possible '' . 
  `` they are clearly sending out a message saying : ` you are not welcome here and we want you to leave . ' '', 
  what country ( s ) have put in controls on religion ? 
  thats not a rule any more . 
  the gulf states spend an insane amount promoting wahhabism . 
  you can spend all the time you want engaging in discussions but when saudi waves a cheque that can build you a new mosque or bring 10 kids to saudi for an all expenses paid religious training who are they going to listen to ? 
  have mediterranean crossings been quiet recently or is italy just being ignored again ? 
  lets create a list of things migrants dont like about europe . 
  british food . 
  small swedish towns . 
  hungary . 
  paris is too noisy . 
  kurds 7 . 
  turks .

  i 'd be more impressed if you could find an issue that no economists disagreed with . 
  making everyone not hungry key to ending world hunger . 
  because it would be called racism . 
  unsurprisingly several christians have been arrested under the law . 
  what are you actually scared of ? 
  yep , this guy slaps her and then starts kicking her while she 's on the ground . 
  what if the opposition destroys itself ? 
  gino d'acampo is a pretty famous italian tv chef and personality . 
  its not the royal family as much as the queen . 
  she 's been the queen for as long a large portion of the country has been alive . 
  the royal family 's popularity will drop dramatically when charles becomes king . 
  british indians are relatively wealthy and educated compared to other ethnic groups in the uk . 
  it 'd be easier if they were all selected and i could declick the countries i wouldnt want to live in . 
  we 're a soft power empire now . 
  him fighting for rebels says nothing about his religious beliefs or his intentions in europe . 
   1 , making immigration legal , that will basically eliminate trafficking  make rape legal . 
  no more rape . 
  then they do their time in sweden , get given a passport and fuck off to britain . 
   hese people were mainly workers who migrated to saudi arabia prior to the crisis no they arent . 
  the number of syrians has jumped from 100,000 to 500,000 in the past 2 years . 
  as i posted in the other thread . 
  saudi arabia has took in 500,000 syrian refugees , they just dont call them refugees but brothers in distress and are given work/visitor visas therefore dont count on any refugee lists . 
  they have also donated a decent chunk of money . 
  there are enough reasons to shit on sa without having to invent them . 
  according to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3jrrv6/there_are_500000_syrians_in_saudi_arabia/curxxin ) from / u/sureaviator the syrian population in saudi arabia has jumped from 100,000 to 500,000 in the past 2 years . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-04/syria-s-refugees-feel-more-welcome-in-europe-than-in-the-gulf about 3/4 of the way down . 
   there are 500,000 syrians in saudi arabia , according to nabil othman , acting regional representative to the gulf region at the unhcr . 
  in official documentation they are referred to as `` arab brothers and sisters in distress , '' he said . 
  saudi doesnt consider syrians to be refugees but ` brothers in need ' ( or something along those lines ) . 
  according to the unhcr representative there are an estimated 500,000 syrian ` brothers in need ' in saudi arabia . 
  join the french foreign legion . 
  when they try and send you to war claim asylum in germany . 
  they generally go after ` at risk ' kids . 
  kids who live in care homes , who have ill , neglectful , drunk/drug user parents or kids who for whatever reason dont have a support system that teens need . 
   if they do n't get welfare from germany and ca n't work in germany there is n't a big incentive to go to germany . 
  hypothetically , what happens if they decide to go to germany ( france , sweden etc. ), 
  anyway ? 
  i cant imagine they 'd be allowed to sleep rough and be ignored . 
  america asks , germany tells . 
  so american ? 
   theres a few military based ones like grenadiers march [ 4 ] which was basically exactly what the title says it was . 
   the lyrics to this are great . 
  some talk of alexander , and some of hercules of hector and lysander , and such great names as these . 
  but of all the world 's great heroes , there 's none that can compare . 
  with a tow , row , row , row , row , row , to the british grenadiers . 
  | those heroes of antiquity ne'er saw a cannon ball , or knew the force of powder to slay their foes withal . 
  but our brave boys do know it , and banish all their fears , with a tow , row , row , row , row , row , for the british grenadiers . 
  | whene'er we are commanded to storm the palisades , our leaders march with fusees , and we with hand grenades . 
  we throw them from the glacis , about the enemies ' ears . 
  [ n 1 ] sing tow , row , row , row , row , row , the british grenadiers . 
  | and when the siege is over , we to the town repair . 
  the townsmen cry , `` hurrah , boys , here comes a grenadier !, 
  here come the grenadiers , my boys , who know no doubts or fears !, 
  then sing tow , row , row , row , row , row , the british grenadiers . 
  | then let us fill a bumper , and drink a health of those who carry caps and pouches , and wear the loup\u00e8d clothes . 
  may they and their commanders live happy all their years . 
  with a tow , row , row , row , row , row , for the british grenadiers . '',

  does anyone know why they liked towers so much ? 
  would you have preferred gadaffi to be able bomb protesters at will while europe did nothing ? 
  because thats a messy tribal war that requires state building . 
  would you have preferred gadaffi to be able bomb protesters at will while europe did nothing ? 
  would you have preferred gadaffi to be able bomb protesters at will while europe did nothing ? 
  anyone with winrar is now a terrorist . 
  all non jews are evil non jews ? 
  whats the legality of this ? 
  how do they convince prisoners to go , i cant imagine you can do this without their permission . 
  she cant make her mind up . 
  one day its no more refugees , the next its all the refugees , then its everyone will have refugees . 
  boat loads of them are heading to the us and china ... 
  is this satire ? 
  vice is many things .
