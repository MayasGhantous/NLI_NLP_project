  well it 's already regulated - try posting child porn somewhere using your real name on facebook ( for instance ) - you 'll have police knocking at your door within the hour . 
   government regulation sorry , where was this mentioned ? 
  nowhere in the conservative manifesto , that 's for sure . 
   the most successful gay acceptance campaign ever christ , you must only read the circlejerk headlines posted in / r/europe if you think that ... 
  seems no different to what the very big companies do anyway ( google , facebook ) . 
  i think the idea is just to expand it to all companies . . ?

  bristol , has the river avon ( stupidly , this translates as literally `` river river '' in old brythonic ) running through the middle : http://imgur.com/a/uuux1,

   hale  best educated oh , the irony ... 
  i 've known one or two people who are into it - i 've even watched a few matches myself , although the time difference makes it quite difficult to consistently do this . 
  i expect no difference , whatever happens , as i would n't think any rules would be applied retroactively . 
  yes , and in my experience people tend to go to the us for an extra-long holiday such as a month of sightseeing , rather than a standard 1 or 2 week trip . 
   would get a little irritated at adam 's pronunciations of `` basil '' and `` oregano '' . 
  twas his pronunciation of `` parmesan '' that made me tut heavily . 
  it 's the same with many america terms - `` sail boat '' instead of `` sailing boat '' ; or even entire phrases such , such as instead of `` writing to you '' they will `` write you '' . 
   the lion . 
  it does n't even live here . 
  never been to longleat ? 
  the thing about american tv is that it runs the gamut from one extreme to the other - ultra high-budget hbo stuff , all the way down to super-cheapo public access tv of which i 've never seen the like of elsewhere . 
  also , i would say we produce much more middle of the road stuff compared to the states - i imagine something as inane as , say , [ hearbeat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heartbeat_\\ ( uk_tv_series \\ ) ) would ever see the light of day in the us . 
  as i understand it , there are much higher standards for stadiums for top-level football than you yould need/get in the us : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uefa_stadium_categories, 
  in living memory , probably the italia 90 semi-final against w.germany - penalties , natch . 
  netflix , natch, 
  by definition , nobody know what 's going on with the negotiations . 
  androids , iphones are seen as a bit pikey . 
  alexander graham bell . 
  jack t. ripper/dennis nilsen most likely ( possibly fred west also , for the youngsters out there ) . 
   proof no , that 's one of about a gajillion ^ 50 different speculated sources of the word - you can spend a fun few hours on the internet trying to hunt them down , such as : http://www.gavinrymill.com/origin-of-the-word-soccer.html, 
   the heavily `` scots-irish '' culture of much of the south and midwest yeah , most of this is self-reported - probably more influenced with whatever was the last film the person answering the survey was than any basis in fact . 
   a source is the guardian ? 
  bit of a circlejerk on all the reddit fetishes , i 'm afraid - certainly no better than the telegraph , independent or equivalent . 
  better to get your news from somewhere like the bbc or similar . 
  yep , my grandfather fought in the pacific theatre , icluding the battle of singapore - did not go well , and he spent 3 + years as a japanese prisoner of war . 
  not fun , but at least he got to eat a dog , so there 's that .

   is announced the establishment of its khorasan branch - an old name for afghanistan and surrounding areas - in january 2015 . 
  it was the first time that is had officially spread outside the arab world . 
   it was the first major militant group to directly challenge the afghan taliban 's dominance over the local insurgency . 
   however , experts say it has struggled to build a wide political base and the indigenous support it expected in afghanistan . 
   it has also steadily lost territory and fighters to us air strikes and an assault by afghan forces on the ground  estimates about is 's numerical strength inside afghanistan vary , ranging from several hundred to a few thousand fighters . 
  us forces say their number has been cut in half since early 2016 due to military operations . 
  gives me the horn - i ca n't get enough of it . 
  got a big old semi just thinking about it ... 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39595989 good stuff , hope it managed to get as many of isis as possible . 
  hmm , it would be very difficult for them to register at , say , a doctors surgery if they are not citizens , but if you were taken to hospital in an emergency , you would certainly receive treatment without being interrogated as to your personal details . 
  right , but why would comitting the crime allow them healthcare when they would have it already ? 
   that sentiment is strong here you certainly get some sympathy in the uk on this one , the us is basically criticised * whatever they do * - it seems to me that if the us intervenes in a situation , they will be labelled as `` oil-hungry war-mongers '' ( regardless of if there 's any truth to it . 
  if they do n't intervene , they 'll be said to be complicit in the death of innocent civilians because `` they are doing nothing '' . 
  to be fair , i do n't think you could blame the us with whatever action they take as there is no ` right answer ' to such situations in the first place . 
  one of the most infuriating things is the incredible over-simplification of phenomenally complex issues by ( not least ) redditors and other similar internet users !, 
  well , america is damned if they do and damned if they do n't - they 're going to get almost exactly the same level of criticism from almost exactly the same people whatever they do .

  there was a bbc documentary a few years ago following ben dover as he was struggling to break into the world of mainstream acting : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1505798/  `` for years , ben dover has been one of britain 's top porn performers and producers . 
  this fictional character , a middle-aged man who women ca n't resist , is the alter-ego of one lindsay honey . 
   porn has made him rich but dissatisfied , and he has always yearned to be taken seriously as a straight actor . 
  now , when money is not an issue but personal fulfilment is , he sets out to achieve his dream of performing , with lines and a costume . 
   can he make it or will his previous success make him unemployable ? '',

  trundling along in much the same way as it has been for some years now - unemployment down a bit , which is good , although wages are not rising any faster than the cost of living , which is not so good . 
  all on all , 6.5 / 10 . 
  regarding trump - he 's clearly as mad as a box of frogs , but in the us the president does n't have a massive amount of power to do things unilaterally trump in charge of another country with less democratic oversight would be a worry , though ( possibly similar to putin ) . 
  turkey has always been a bit ditzy , par for the course for erdogan . 
  probably more worrying when he goes quiet or contemplative . 
  and the philippines - while i would n't have put them at the top of the democracy index to begin with , it is troubling just * how much * public support duturte has for his insanity . 
   do you agree there 's a general rise in fascism around the world today ? 
  no , and even so , these things are cyclical . 
  opinions on these things are mostly dictated by how much they 're covered in the media . 
  no , robbery is taking without consent - if i legally sign over my property to you , you ca n't start crying and demand it back 10 minutes later .
