   flair : the netherlands somebody needs a trip down history-lane on this subject ... 
  no , that 's exactly what most people would have said about the falklands circa 1980 . 
  it 's actually one of the mods from / r/vpn - / u/thatoneprivacyguy .

  no need if scotland joins the eu, 
  naturally - much better to cheer on a yank than a frog , for instance, 
  the other anglosphere countries would be a lot of peoples second teams . 
  really ? 
  any examples ?

   scotland and/or n.ireland get to stay in eu via some series of * well , that 's an impossibility because they 're not separate countries . 
  you may as well speculate that my back garden gets to stay in the eu . 
  i 'd love to , but the time commitment ( and cost ) to see everything i would want to would be so immense - maybe one day if i win the lottery !, 
  i feel that the only sensible way to do it would be several trips , maybe one year the west coast , the next year the east coast , next year the deep south etc. . . 
  certainly something to aim for , anyway !, 
  seems like a sort of stop-gap measure until they can abolish it . 
  any idea why it 's taking quite so long for this ? 
  7 , natch : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roygbiv, 
  really ? 
  wikipedia disagrees :  article 20 of the russian constitution states that everyone has the right to life , and that `` until its abolition , death penalty may only be passed for the most serious crimes against human life . '', 
  additionally , all such sentences require jury trial ...  the current penal code [ 11 ] permits death penalty for five crimes :  murder , with certain aggravating circumstances ( article 105.2 ) encroachment on the life of a person administering justice or engaged in a preliminary investigation ( article 295 ) encroachment on the life of an officer of a law-enforcement agency ( article 317 ) encroachment on the life of a statesman or a public figure ( article 277 ) genocide ( section 357 ) . 
  there are all sorts of prequesites to joining the eu - free and fair elections , no death penalty ( not to mention economic tests to pass ) etc , etc. ... - there 's frankly so many barriers to even * potential * consideration , i ca n't think of where to begin . 
  c.b fry ( 1872-1956 ) : played for england at both cricket and football , played in a fa cup final with southampton , held the world record for the long-jump , ran for paliament , was offered the throne of albania , was rumoured to be a closet exhibitionist and possible nudist , once met with hitler and von ribbentrop as an attempt to get germany to take up cricket , and had a rather smashing party-trick where he could leap backwards onto a mantlepeice from a stationary position . 
  for jelly , raspberry . 
  for jam , strawberry . 
  genocide is so funny !, 
  bankrupt , most likely . 
  afaik , all us news outlets are for-profit coporations - they 're not beholden to anybody or anything , correct ? 
  the opposite is probably more likely . 
  merkel pregnant by trump confirmed . 
   the politicians still pander to the religious , but that are not allowed to act on it once in office . 
  well , the point was that it 's almost impossible not to - when so much of the country is super-religious , all sorts of decisions are made ( by both parties ) on this basis - censorship , abortion , gay rights , etc. ... having a `` de jure '' seperation of church & state is all well and good , but if the `` de facto '' situation entwines them so tightly , then it 's merely a symbolic gesture . 
   otherwise the other 55 million will always override their decisions . 
  and that 's worse than the 750 million of the eu ... ? 
   un that union they would be equal sovereign partners . 
  wat they would have considerably less influence over the eu than they would in the uk ... christ , what a bizarre thought comment this is, 
   having english people rule over wales and northen ireland wow - / r/badpolitics -- , 
   in america we do not have religious political parties due to our laws i ca n't see how you can say that seriously - it 's essentially impossible to become president in the us without pandering to religion . 
  you can actually see the average figures over the years for the lords here ( the commons seems much more fiddly to find out ) : http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-lords-faqs/lords-sittings/, 
  christ almighty - surely that guy can not be for real ?

   also : `` no go zones '' , where does this come from !?!, 
  it 's an american term used to describe many of their cities ; only they do n't realise it does n't apply of mean anything elsewhere in the developed world - the attitude being `` if we have ` no go zones ' , they * must * exist elsewhere '',

  just got soaked by a huge downpour coming home from work . 
  so the answer is `` re-assuringly wet '' . 
  fwiw , just imagine how much of a junior partner you 'd be in the eu - somewhere between lithuania and slovakia ... 
  no facts , please . 
   closest ally are the uk who are anti-ee and ani-eu ( and pro-russia ) / r/badpolitics / r/badhistory, 
  europe is not a country, 
  not sure those percentages are right - bear in mind americans often make up their `` heritage '' based on whatever is trendy any given week . 
   tearing them down if they climb too high and become too full of themselves . 
  a sort of `` you should n't think you 're better than anyone else '' attitude . 
  sounds similar to the scottish concept of '' [ i ken your father ] ( http://www.theanswerbank.co.uk/phrases-and-sayings/question661846.html ) '', 
   it became quite clear with the brexit vote : the welsh , the irish , the scots i do n't know why you 'd mention the welsh in that list - they voted ` leave ' at a higher rate than the national average .

  pretty much every euro country has at least one eurosceptic party - it 's just some parties are larger or have more influence than others . 
  this might be a decent read : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euroscepticism#euroscepticism_in_the_eu_member_states, 
  generally speaking , in the western world , secularism is just a reflection of how developed a country is - everything else is just footnotes . 
  well , ok , but in that case you 're talking about media coverage - 1 person killed in just about any european country is going to be front-page news because it is so rare . 
  in this us , this would be so common as to be barely be given any recognition at all - so the outrage/coverage of such things are relative to how usual/rare these events are in the society where they occurred .
