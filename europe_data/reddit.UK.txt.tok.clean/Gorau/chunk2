  i usually leave a small tip if i think the service has been exceptional but most danes i know even find that very odd . 
  wow you take things way to seriously the copenhagen part is a bit of humour based on it being in the capital region and a personal experience of a friend almost booking a hotel on bornholm because the area was listed under copenhagen which is why i clarified that in parenthesise . 
  also where i live is not really in copenhagen either but every dane i have met still describes it 's location as copenhagen . 
  well done cutting it off before the parenthetical phrase , try reading the whole thing . 
   that is technically part of copenhagen ( well part of the `` capital region '' ), 
  i never claimed it was geographically located in copenhagen ... i said it was part of the capital region , which it is . 
  [ i do n't make the rules ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_region_of_denmark#/media/file:hovedstaden_in_denmark.svg ), 
  it appears bornholm is on the map ... that is technically part of copenhagen ( well part of the `` capital region '' ) right ... \u00d6land also appears to be there but no sweden . 
  eurovision again ? 
  is it every year ? 
  i was under the impression it was less often than that, 
  it would be interesting to see it with the different protestant religions but i guess it 's pretty much england and wales with anglican , scandinavia and germany with lutheran and scotland and some pockets in europe with calvinism . 
  i though the products were aimed at people with diabetes or some food intolerance it at least has it 's own little section thing going on in my local netto , packaging looks cheap though . 
  i disagree if you consider net migration statistics for the uk march 2013 - 2014 was 243,000 from march 2014 -2015 was 298,000 . 
  that 's a change in the difference by half a million people in less that half the time and that would only increase if you had the other 2-3 years , a change i would consider significant to make the data not interesting . 
  5 year old data is 5 years old whether it supports your belief or not . 
  the only way this is interesting is if we have modern data to compare it to at least then we could hypothesize on trends for the coming years . 
  this article is over a year old using data that is almost 5 years old . 
  bacon in tomato sauce ? 
  what the shit denmark ? 
  when i started danish lessons after moving here one of my danish friends responded `` what 's the point ? 
  everyone speaks english anyway '', 
  sometimes one can generalise an area no matter how big it is . 
  the fact is there are 38 out of 54 countries where being homosexual is illegal , some carry the death penalty while only 6 have anti-discrimination laws protecting homosexuals and 1 allows same sex marriage and adoption . 
  if you calcualte the populations you have about only 7 % ( south africa is almost 5 % of africa ) of the entire population of africa living in a country that has anti-discrimination laws , i think we can say that africa is largly anti-gay . 
  i do n't know about the rest of britain but when i grew up in wales talking on the bus or train was pretty normal . 
  i doubt it is a forced concept , i think most places in europe had some sort of celebrations somewhere around the solstice . 
  a lot of elements of christmas in many countries come from the roman saturnalia . 
  that 's what makes this situation difficult to know if it 's worth caring about . 
  if obama was missing for a week we would know something had happened . 
  with putin it could be anything from a blocked nose to his assassination . 
  for some reason some places ( at least in denmark but i 'm sure i have seen it other places ) in continental europe call them `` pomme frites '' . 
  you also have things like the falklands . 
  does an eu army react to an invasion ? 
  even if it does i bet the decision would take longer than the uk alone . 
  gibralter would be interesting , britain and spain have issues over this including several military issues . 
  on top of that you have other issues . 
  what of finland and sweden who are not part of nato and from what i remember sweden does n't want to join . 
  then we ask were does the equipment and money come from , britain and france spend considerably more than any other country in the eu . 
  some are getting better i think in eastern europe but germany and scandinavia may as well not bother . 
  i know a lot of irish that say `` buddy '' a lot . 
  which is pretty silly by this point since it 's popular enough to come up on / r/all now, 
  so your solution is people should just do it for free ? 
  how stupid , if it is content you want to consume you should be willing to pay or contribute in another way if you do not then stop consuming the content . 
  they are pretty awful in the uk too really but the ones in denmark are beyond i 'm not sure why anyone goes in them . 
   most of the aldis in other countries belong to aldi south [ it seems fairly evenly split according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aldi#/media/file:aldi_world_map.png ) . 
  interesting though i always wondered why the one in denmark was so bad compared to the uk and it 's because they are not the same . 
  and i guess like many in the others from what i see in the comments it is also a town not a village, 
  you did n't argue that it had the right to genetic privacy you argued it was for the best interests of the child . 
  the best interest of the child will always be 2 parents who want to raise that child together . 
  when the child is born is probably the best time to get this aspect out of the way rather than a few years down the line . 
  you comparison does n't make sense either , in your example you are suing the person who shit give the dna . 
  suing the mother for the childs dna is suing her for apparently something you claim she does not have the right to give . 
   the child has more rights than the parents . 
  being raised by 2 parents is an important thing . 
  wanting to know what sperm was used to produce the child ... not that important . 
  if you value your sperm so much , you sue the misses . 
  so lets say a man distrusts his wife but not enough to sue . 
  the child is born he does n't sue to get a paternity test . 
  the distrust deepens over the years and the child grows up with parents in an unhappy relationship and constantly arguing . 
  at some point the guy finds out she has been cheating or just decides he needs a paternity test so he sues gets a paternity test finds out it 's not his and wants no more to do with mother or child . 
  now that child has had a portion of it 's life with lots of arguing and has no father anyway . 
  how is that in the best interests of the child ? 
  i think a lot of the opt-outs are the same as the uk , the people who have mentioned it to me think that denmark will be less likely to get the opt-outs without the uk pushing for them too . 
  interestingly as a british person living in denmark a lot of danes have said to me that if britain does leave then denmark should consider doing the same . 
  it seems less popular among younger danes but the older ones seem to want out . 
  personally i 'd rather both stay but it seems to be getting harder to justify staying for britain but i think it would be easier to justify denmark staying . 
  i do n't get what you are on about there is no international committee that chooses the names of archipelagos that happens to also dislike the irish . 
  people use british isles because everyone understands what it is and it is the simplest way to say it . 
  you can call it what you like i doubt many people will complain about you using a different term provided it 's understandable . 
  in english an analphabet is someone who does n't know the alphabet at all whereas someone who is illiterate may know the alphabet but be unable to read or write . 
  literally the first article you linked  the informal practice of incarcerating people who can not pay fines or fees was also explicitly outlawed by the us supreme court in 1983 in a ruling that stated that to punish an individual for their poverty was a violation of the 14th amendment of the us constitution that ensures equal protection under the law . 
  i think ` new north new south wales ' is probably the best option here . 
  i did n't check myself since at the time it was pretty easy to judge the general opinion but a quick google search confirms it http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8299288/majority-of-public-say-no-prisoner-should-get-vote.html, 
  i guess that depends if you are trying to be pedantic . 
  if you mean we as in including you personally then i obviously can not say . 
  if you mean we as in the common opinion of the british public that is the feeling i got and it is the opinion of those the british public chose to represent them . 
  protection of human rights should be handled by the european court of human rights which originally was not part of the eu . 
  the british government does also not agree with prisoners right to vote . 
  `` human rights are universal , not democratic '' this sentence does n't actually mean anything . 
  i ca n't find figures for the current status but upon making capital punishment illegal many countries had large support for it at least in germany and france who both outlawed it after the uk . 
  right because they have been added to and are now including rights that the british public does not agree with such as prisoners right to vote . 
  but again irrelevant the uk had human rights before the eu and therefore the eu could not have given the uk human rights which is the claim . 
  many countries in the eu have violated human rights on several occasions . 
  but that is irrelevant anyway the point made is that we would n't have human rights in the uk without the eu which is quiet frankly utter nonsense . 
  personally i do n't think i have enough information to decide which way to vote yet but either way i just do n't see the point in lying about any of this . 
  hopefully the truth will come out from all aspects and the british public can make an informed decision though i fear this is n't going to happen . 
   protection of human rights . 
  i was n't aware that the uk was in such a ghastly state of affairs . 
  this one is always amusing . 
  we signed the echr before the eu even existed . 
  it might be the depth , i have no idea how much they need but i think the tunnel is only about 10m below the surface which seems pretty shallow for a large ship . 
  would you really want to join in the savagery of no proper queue that is going on there ? 
  i 've lived in denmark for some years and never heard of this ... who is in front of a tv at that time on new years eve : / . 
  this map seems to be suggesting civilisation exists in france which is utterly preposterous . 
  france might also have something to say about being ruled by a king . 
  the number of us states is trivia but considerably easier to remember since it has never changed in my lifetime while the eu has changed 3 times in the last 11 years . 
  did you read the article you posted ? 
   they intercepted the russian warplanes in ** international airspace ** near stornoway eventually the russians left the ** borders ** of uk airspace so it seems they did n't actually invade our airspace at all . 
  also i have n't noticed any war zones next to the uk and certainly none that russia have an active campaign in .
