  london is low because it takes the whole of greater london . 
  rightmove says # 1.4 m for central london http://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices-in-central-london.html, 
  it was n't really a ban , products in denmark have to be approved if they have added vitamins and the importer had not had the product approved . 
  i believe someone has now got the approval and it is available again . 
  i would n't really say the article claims it to be false , in fact it just seems like a list quotes with no real journalism involved at all . 
  the plug is my biggest hate in denmark . 
  i mean i buy a laptop and it has a plug with 3 pins and i go to plug it in but the socket only has 2 god damn holes . 
  then you go to work and you go to plug it in but then it 's the drunken one the other guy mentioned . 
  you ask someone what the shit this is about and the tell you it 's the plug for `` computers and things '' and i 'm like what the fuck do you think a laptop is ? 
  that are on roads that people are likely to be driving on ? 
  maybe there is some but i would n't think it was that many even on the smaller roads you 'd come across a farm or b & b within a few hours of walking . 
  i think unless you have taken some weird back road or think across the mountains is the quickest way you 'd survive . 
  i completely agree and personally have never met anyone who does n't have one . 
  even in northern scandinavia it will never be that far to a small village provided you have n't gone off road . 
  you probably need some decent clothes but you should have those if you are in that area anyway . 
  did you read the article ? 
  the unanimous vote is for extending the 2 years . 
  article 50 says nothing about reversing it and as the news article states . 
   the vienna convention on the law of treaties says that they can be reversed unless they state otherwise, 
  i think one of the problems might be areas like the falklands . 
  they are a dependent territory but not part of the uk and most importantly not part of the eu . 
  since they are not part of the eu then are the eu army required to defend it , even if this has to be discussed it delays the response . 
  i believe denmark , france and the netherlands all have similar dependant territories . 
  that 's unfair , not everyone is eligible to vote . 
  i 'd be willing to bet whoever created that bot is irish , so far from over it so far it seems . 
  maybe in a few hundred years . 
  i 've been trying to convince my girlfriend to move for ages . 
  i 'd need to touch up on my french and find a job in the south first anyway . 
  petrol prices have raised slightly as far as i can see but i am also paying more per l now than i was a few months ago and i live in denmark . 
  it may have gone up a little due to the # but in all honesty you 'll need to argue that with the head of inflation for the ons who i quoted above . 
  internationally perhaps but that is n't going to matter for most poor people until it starts increasing prices in british shops and the ons recently said  there is no explicit evidence the lower pound is pushing up the prices of everyday consumer goods, 
  you have missed the half of the information that would allow a conclusion . 
  unless you have the figure for the number of people with only # 100 in their account before the vote you can not use it to say anything about the state of peoples wealth . 
  french is n't exactly shunned in britain , i 'm pretty sure it 's the most popular second language , it 's considered desirable by many businesses . 
  most school children will have the ** opportunity ** to learn it to a fairly good level . 
  [ french has been used in parliament ] ( https://youtu.be/szg8h9n-zt8 ) although they may not be very good at it . 
  norman french is also used for several official things in parliament for example when a finance bill is passed the clerk of parliament will respond to the clerk of the crown with  la reyne , remerciant ses bons subjects , accepte leur benevolence , et ainsi le veult . 
  while it could have be used as a negotiation tactic the british government is free to allow them to remain regardless of outcomes from negotiations and [ i believe they have come out and said that ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-brexit-latest-nationals-uk-stay-immigration-a7351446.html ) . 
  yeah living in southern spain and working in norway is probably the way to go here . 
   point is ireland was one undivided entity not sure if you are being serious but for anyone is wondering [ these are the kingdoms of the so called undivided entity ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/www.wesleyjohnston.com-users-ireland-maps-historical-map1014.gif ), 
   can you guess which ? 
  typical behaviour from hungary !, 
  every time !, 
  i ca n't see anything on the bottle that indicates what kind i guess it 's just typical dansk snaps something similar to [ aalborg akvavit ] ( https://bonnier.imgix.net/aalborgtaffelakvavit-i7hb_brzkzvjc2kheqlj4q.jpg ) i would guess . 
  though that would n't be the snaps i would suggest trying if you want to get a bottle . 
  no it is called viking blod it is with hibiscus . 
  prefer the one on the end though which is called klap\u00f8jster and has snaps mixed in . 
  i am planning to make my own soon though so maybe i will call it fking blod in your honour . 
  well i was going to share a picture of my underberg collected in germany but i realise i am in need of another journey [ so here is my mj\u00f8d and shitty ikea furniture . 
  that point is not really true , you will see many danes crossing at red lights in copenhagen . 
  the older will generally wait and you do some see some younger people waiting too but it is n't in any way rare to see them cross . 
  as someone who has only lived in the uk and denmark ` ridiculously expensive ' is not how i would describe db prices . 
  in the uk people have been fined and banned for driving too slow . 
  it comes under `` driving without reasonable consideration ''  the maximum penalty is a level 5 fine . 
  the court must also either endorse the drivers licence with between 3 and 9 penalty points ( unless there are `` special reasons '' not to do so ) , or impose disqualification for a fixed period and/or until a driving test has been passed . 
  some of it is pretty crazy , i generally agree with school uniforms but my school was a bit over the top . 
   school uniform is blue blazer and grey trousers with an appropriate school tie and navy v-neck sweater ( school pattern only ) . 
  forms iii - v wear a white shirt ; forms i & ii wear a light blue shirt ( available from the school shop ) . 
   all boys should wear black polished shoes , not boots or trainers , and plain dark socks . 
   a plain dark top-coat may be worn to school , or an official school games anorak . 
   school scarves only may be worn . 
  this was n't just expected in the school it was expected anywhere you were still in your uniform . 
  from the staff handbook :  please correct shortcomings whenever you see them , whether this is in the house , your classroom , around the site ** or in the town ** . 
  it 's also not in the interest of nato to have countries that can not properly contribute to the defense of it 's allies ( with exceptions like iceland having an strategically important location ) . 
  they joined a defense alliance that has defense spending requirements and they should meet them or not expect the benefits . 
  people on the sub bitch ( and rightly so ) about the uk wanting benefits of the eu without paying the price but seem to expect to be able to do the same with nato . 
  i do n't particularly agree with trump or the other guy but surely that is all the more reason to enforce the minimum defense funding requirement that nato has . 
  if countries are not interested in funding the defense of their own country why should other member be . 
  does the article give a source for the numbers ? 
  i find it hard to believe 90 % were against it . 
  that certainly was n't true amongst people i knew . 
  this link seems to support the fact people were in favour of the war . 
  i do n't know much of this football game but i 'm fairly certain portugal deserved this win . 
  from what i could tell wales had a lot of possession at the start but seemed to be far too cautious they got more into it as time went on but so did portugal . 
  never mind the result i 'm proud they got this far and proud that they tried until the end . 
  maybe it wo n't be another 60 years or so until the next big competition . 
  i cycled from berlin to copenhagen , the area north of berlin is pretty amazing . 
  that said i would choose hamburg over berlin if i were to move to germany ( i 've not been to any other cities in germany ) . 
  [ these ] ( https://i.imgur.com/uozbkoq.jpg ) have been around in most supermarkets for the last 2 years . 
  there is probably a few things , first of all a large wealthy population with access to insanely cheap flights . 
  i think bachelor weekends make an impact too . 
  i 'm not sure if other countries in europe do it the same i certainly have n't heard of it in denmark . 
  in the uk a large group going abroad with a budget airline with the sole purpose of getting completely hammered and maybe hiring a few prostitutes has become insanely common . 
  i 'm at the age where a lot of friends are now getting married , so far not 1 has remained in the uk for a bachelor weekend . 
  my friends in denmark it is more like 1 night , fairly local and nobody dresses up . 
   my friends there give me so much shit because of how the other people from my country behave there . 
  try being british with lots of friends from countries east of germany . 
  i think to really annoy them you have to say `` czechoslovakia and the other eastern european countries '' . 
  i take no responsibility for death resulting from repeating that . 
  both sides are making desperate claims that are probably false . 
  it would have been nice if we could have had a reasonable debate on this issue but i suppose there was little hope with cameron on one side and boris on the other . 
  bog is used in british english too . 
  latrine is perhaps not common these days but would still be understood as such . 
  `` throne room '' is another i 've heard used . 
  5 hours per week is not a lot . 
  i live in denmark so probably different to poland in terms of cycling but 5 hours is just to work and back everyday for me . 
  add in shopping , going to sports clubs , going for beer , meeting friends and maybe a random ride on the weekend . 
  i probably easily exceed 10 hours most weeks, 
  there are many fjords in denmark ... but they are not what you are thinking of ... [ an example of a danish fjord , isefjord ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hdtks2p.jpg ), 
  we have it in denmark,
