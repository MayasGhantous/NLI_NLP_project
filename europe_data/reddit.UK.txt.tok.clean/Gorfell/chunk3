  it has forces around the world , able to move fairly quickly . 
  it lacks heavy lift capacity but has found work-arounds that seem adequate for current needs . 
  development of an aircraft carrier force would improve the uk 's position as it has a history of using them intelligently . 
  and , of course , it has alliances upon which it can depend . 
  also mali was an example of how we have maintained our ability to power project to the point france our closest military power to our own needed us to fly them out there . 
   intermediate steps , such as the closer integration of national navies to aid frontex , would be possible in a timely manner . 
  right but that was not your initial post . 
  so how has the uk blamed the eu for its own mistakes ? 
  ok well as we reached agreement on a navy not solving the current crisis i think i need to come to the point where i acknowledge your now better explained solution is feasible though i personally do n't like it ( the federalisation bits ) . 
  i would rather choose other solutions though its a democracy , im a voice among many . 
   however much eurosceptics loathe the eu , a group of basically friendly and allied countries in close co-operation with each other is far preferable to a group of volatile democracies with extremist nationalist governments eyeing each other with distrust . 
  especially if it 's only a channel separating them from yourself . 
  right but there are degrees between fascism and federalisation . 
  i would also would like to point out the potential war argument for the necessity of the eu always falls flat with us brits , nobody has successfully invaded us in 1000 years . 
  its a valid argument but our experiences with war in europe have always been drastically different than those on the continent . 
   the problem is n't the manpower , the problem is the logistics of getting them there and maintaining them : food , clothing , ammunition , repairs , etc. 
  this is how a modern intervention looks like , and it was basically at our doorstep . 
  without a large budget to account for all the logistics , you can not invade a country that neighbours you , let alone is only reachable by sea . 
  true but we still operate a blue water navy , we also operated independently though in conjunction with allied forces in iraq and afghanistan . 
  nor let us forget the falklands . 
  it was also the raf who flew the french out to mali . 
  by its nature the uk military has to be able to operate over seas , after all everything is over seas to us . 
  ok fair enough was getting fighty there . 
  as to point 1 . 
  the creation of a eu navy would take years ( building of ships , training of personnel , unification of command and communication/language , standardisation of equipment etc ) and the co-operation and consent of all eu nations . 
  any solution to the current crisis need to be implemented now . 
  france or britain 's navy could achieve this immediately jointly if needed there is no need for a unified navy in this sense . 
  the eu could simply ask for us to help but it does not , not because it ca n't but because there is no consensus within eu politicians how to solve or go about handling the crisis . 
  its fine to want and seek a eu navy but this current crisis seems flimsy justification to me . 
  as to 2 . the eu can run refugee camps if it wants to i guess but you could simply provide aid and asylum application centres at ones that currently exist , like the uk is doing now . 
  though its not something you mentioned on 2 i pops up later , the majority of migrants are coming across the aegean from turkey and are from syria/afghanistan/iraq / pakistan seems a bit unfair to set these camps up in north africa when its a primarily middle east issue . 
  no bad idea , there are camps throughout europe at the moment unfortunately keeping people there will be an issue . 
   and while turkey would rightfully not be afraid of eu military intervention , it does , however , react to economic incentives . 
  money only goes so far , currently turkey 's actions have changed little . 
   one last comment on the use of military : ( my comment excluded for simplicity ) i highly doubt that a single member state could if it wanted to . 
  seen as we are talking about military , it is within britain 's capacity the lebanese armed forces number 100,000 according to wikipedia less than the british army alone . 
  the days of gunboat diplomacy have long since gone however , if you do that you end up like russia . 
  thats why its not being perused not because we ca n't . 
   setting up refugee camps is not an invasion . 
  we do not strike deep into enemy territory and bomb & control urban centres , but establish and defend eu camps along the coast while keeping up diplomatic channels that favour a solution as long as eu-run camps can exist . 
  the most difficult part is the logistics of running the whole thing , hostile or not . 
  it is by definition an invasion http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/invasion, 
  in my opinion the the lack of sarcasm when using the word utopia is what 's wrong with the continent . 
  we do not live in a perfect world there will ** always ** be stress on the system , if its not flexible it will break . 
  there are camps in the eu already , that does not discourage traffickers . 
  libya has to agree to that first . 
   if people choose to travel back to their country of origin , does the country have the right to refuse entry to one of its own citizens ? 
  ... what ? 
  host countries of the refugee camps not the refugees country of origin . 
  http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/host or are you implying the refugees want to go back to syria ? 
  because if they did i doubt they would have left ...  and as always in international diplomacy , the power of 500 million with the highest gdp in the world will count for more than any single member state alone . 
  it does n't . 
  i bet turkey is quaking in their boots `` oh no we better take back those refugees or the eu will sick its gdp on us '' . 
  even if the eu had a unified military it would not use it to bully people over a refugee crisis . 
   again , can a country deny entry to one of its own citizens ? 
  everything else was covered above . 
  lets ignore you not understanding what `` host '' means and move to the hypothetical forcing ** refugees ** to return to their country of origin : the obligation exists under article 33 of the 1951 refugee convention not to return a refugee to a country of territory where he/she would be at risk of persecution : `` no contracting state shall expel or return ( `` refouler '' ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . ''  you meant set-up ? 
  a mixture of international diplomacy and , failing this , military intervention to set-up these camps . 
  no setting up is easy , i was replying to your comment  european navy guarding the med and eu asylum camps in nafr . 
  states . 
  in order to guard them effectively you would need to be inside the host country 's territorial waters . 
   if they can not ensure their own territory 's integrity and it endangers both refugees ' safety and our security , we can set-up our own camps with our own military . 
  yup starting a war to reduce refugee numbers , totally gunna work . 
  also would totally attact refugees nothing says `` welcome '' like a challenger tank . 
  / s  since my proposal is not `` sent them back to the camps '' because neither do the camps exist when you say the camps do n't exist im going to assume you mean eu run ones . 
  however just in case your akin to a holocaust denier ill post this here http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/24/syria-refugee-crisis-world thats a picture of the zaatari camp from 2013 . 
  the difference however is circumstantial if your planning to have the camps in other countries then you still need permission from those countries to bring people into them , running a camp does not give us sovereignty over it . 
   nor the political power to enforce them either by diplomatic or military means quite simply because no european state alone has the power to do so , yes , i am rather certain your criticism is void . 
  ... ... . your joking right ? 
  yeah no singular european country has the power to impose its will over lebanon / s we do n't go around imposing our will on humanitarian crisis 's by force because we do n't want to make them worse not because we ca n't . 
  refugee camps exist within countries they are not the citizens of those countries when they leave , the host country does not want them back . 
  toothpaste does go back into the tube without a mess . 
  unless your planning to force them to do so and break international law that 's not going to happen . 
  also how do you plan to patrol refugee camps in nafr states , you gunna violate their sovereign territory ? 
  you honestly think if it was as simple as `` send them back to the camps '' we would not have done it already ? 
  because its a democratic union of nation states each with their own separate laws . 
  democracy is every one gets a vote not every one is equal . 
  thats your opinion . 
  you 're in a democracy whether you like it or not people are going to disagree . 
  implying people do n't belong in a democracy because they disagree with you is petty . 
  passive aggression much ? 
  common market , also we can travel freely and work in europe the only difference is a minor inconvenience of a border check ( convenience is all schengen offers ) . 
  ireland is also not in schengen . 
  right but its not in schengen so there are still border checks . 
  great that way we can have unified coast guard that wo n't achieve anything . 
  policy 's wont magically change because `` federalism '' , we will still be required under international law to help those craft in distress and unable to turn them back because turkey would not accept them . 
  there is a sea between greece and turkey to . 
  yeah its like schengen is nothing but a poorly thought out convenience , what a crazy world we live in . 
   not really sadly when you know all the secret roads which it seems the smugglers took their time to chart ... 
  i guess but only small quantity 's could really make it through without drawing attention to themselves , i will admit no border is 100 % watertight . 
  even if reinstating the border checks along the spanish and italian borders reduced the incoming to calais by lets say 25 % would that not be better ? 
  rather than having them all pool in one place . 
   yeah but most countries do n't have to face a refugee crisis generated by a serie of wars like we currently do again true the refuge crisis is something new , wars however are not . 
  the difference is there is no deterrence where there was once . 
  a continents worth of borders to cross now gone and in its place is nothing but a long walk . 
   sorry if i exagerated . 
  tho it would appear logistically simpler to me to patrol only the english channel vs if you had to patrol the entire length of your coasts and half of them were mountains . 
  imagine if all of scotland and ireland and nordics wanted to go in and where all very poor . 
  thats ok no harm no foul . 
  yes thats true but it does not make it easy , the english channel is the busiest shipping lane in the world there is a lot to keep track of .
