  the majority of europe is on the continent with the major threat being across land . 
  the eu is a representative democracy , democratic candidates will vote according to the needs of those who elected them . 
  given the needs of majority the eu will focus primarily on an army and air force . 
  britain is in the minority of those who are islands , whose defence will become secondary by nature of democracy to others ergo this is not good for britain . 
  norway sorry is irrelevant your not part of the eu only the european economic area . 
  spain , italy etc again have navies but its not super important for them it also still just a secondary concern . 
  why ? 
  partially because again the threat for them is by land , secondly again i feel i have to restate this for you to get it , ** by definition britain is an overseas territory ** being part of a system that caters to others needs is not good for britain when we could just instead keep nato have all the benefits of a larger military force will while still having a military force catered to our needs . 
   in any context because it has a broader definition that just `` territory '' uuuurgh god , its the fact its a broad comment that makes in unsuitable . 
  english is n't fucking german there is some finesse to it . 
  again you still clearly do n't get it , im not offended . 
  i said the eu would not consider a navy as a primary source of defence not out of malicious nature but as a result of the majority being continental and having a different perspective , you responded using `` interests '' the point then on was the tone you used shows the inherent different attitude towards defence i.e. 
  for continentals navies protect interests , for islanders navies protect territory . 
  your the only person who can waste your time . 
  oh for gods sake get the point . 
  stop trying to be patronising and consider the tone of the words you chose . 
  technically i can say `` its in my interests not to get shot '' its however a massive understatement !, 
  my point was you described defending the uk as an interest , if there is a eu force it would be a requirement to defend its constituents . 
  ** it was the tone you conveyed through your choice of words i was addressing ** you could have said defend territory or citizens you did n't you chose `` interests '' which shows secondary nature you hold our defence over yours . 
  there difference in meaning conveyed through the tone of the words you use is large . 
  its like the difference between saying `` i will come round '' or `` i will come round in a bit '' . 
  defending the falklands you could describe as in britain 's interests , i would however would not because i am british and i consider the people of the falklands likewise . 
  a more appropriate use of language to convey my tone would be to say : its a necessity that britain defends its own or it was required to liberate the falklands . 
  `` a group or organization having a common concern , especially in politics or business : '' example : `` the politicians , business interests and journalists that were part of the indonesian lobby in australia did use racial stereotyping . '', 
  ok lem me explain , national interests are things like trade agreements . 
  not being annexed by another country is not an interest of a country , its a fucking requirement to have a country  . < .

  https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/nazis-truce-britain-1941-exchange-wanted-unobstructed-attack-ussr.html luckly churchill was a man of principle . 
   and here i was , thinking that the uk is part of europe , and one of the interests of the uk is their territorial integrity . 
  try to make arguments that do n't rely on wordplay . 
  its not wordplay nor is it an `` interest '' ( its a requirement ) , buy an english dictionary . 
  your use of language is evidence of your attitude it is not wordplay . 
  as you say it is part of the eu but the fact you said a navy defends `` interests '' rather than borders or territory , demonstrates my point you did n't think it was for that , till i reminded you its necessary to defend the eu 's borders because some of it are islands . 
  my points are these : 1 . 
  defence of an island requires a strong navy 2 . 
  the majority of europe is on the continent with the major threat being across land . 
  the eu is a representative democracy , democratic candidates will vote according to the needs of those who elected them . 
  given the needs of majority the eu will focus primarily on an army and air force . 
  britain is in the minority of those who are islands , whose defence will become secondary my nature of democracy to others ergo this is not good for britain . 
  i have made my case that its not in our interests . 
  now present your points that it is in our interests rather than simply saying no . 
   you 're basing your bullshit argument on the idea that europe would not want to have a strong navy capable of defending its interests . 
  the fact you describe the uk as `` interests '' and not territory kinda proves my point . 
  i thought it a bit pretentious to paste the definition of threat so ill short it to its 2 meanings , i do apologise if its rude but its necessary for my point . 
  1 . a statement of an intention to inflict pain , injury , damage , or other hostile action on someone in retribution for something done or not done . 
  `` members of her family have received death threats '' synonyms : threatening remark , warning , ultimatum , intimidating remark ; more rarecommination ; menaces , menacing `` the general had made threats against un personnel '' law a menace of bodily harm , such as may restrain a person 's freedom of action . 
  2 . a person or thing likely to cause damage or danger . 
  `` hurricane damage poses a major threat to many coastal communities '' they did damage and continue to wish to , they are a threat . 
  not a major one but still an issue . 
  its only after we decommissioned our older carriers did the argies start rattling the sabre again . 
  `` by a unified european army '' that 's the point , army protects you not us . 
  you could hold em on land but that means bugger all if you ca n't keep em in check at sea for us , european nations favour green water navies as they have no need for a blue one . 
  democracy is the tyranny of the majority you can bloody bet if it came down to it the uk would be outvoted in regards to maintaining a blue water one . 
  can you honestly see eastern europe or austria voting for anything other than total concentration on air-force and army ? 
  do n't get me wrong i do n't think it would be malicious nor do i mean the eu would ignore us . 
  but you some what helped my point when you said unified eu army note the word `` army '' , not armed forces . 
  your thinking as you should as a nation on a continent , land army 's are your main defence . 
  please consider our position , we are an island . 
  its not just a simply different perspective but a necessity we approach our defence drastically differently than other nations . 
  if we created a united eu force , we would be handing out defence over to people who do not share our perspective , nor ever could truly understand or comprehend our situation . 
  also if russia did take britain i doubt the eu would care as long as it held the continent . 
  ... ... . . first you said `` any threat to your country is going to be external to europe , and will affect other parts of europe first . '', 
  i said falklands as that proves that wrong . 
  argentina threatens us and not you . 
  secondly i was not insinuating russia would be the aggressor ... why on earth would they give a toss about the falkland islands , and risk nuclear war to get em or even risk a naval war with a maritime nation ? 
  a godwin 's law-esque statement `` some one once thought some thing would be good = ww2 , and you think something different will be good to . 
  your like them ! '' . 
  different subjects are different subjects , some times the interests of the eu and uk will be one in the same , some timed they wo n't . 
  each case needs to be addressed individually . 
  its such a blanket statement you might as well say `` yes '' answers all questions  . < . 
  falklands 2 . 
  yes , i do not see how an appeasement speech is relevant ? 
  i be more amenable to that , though not thrilled about it . 
  a lot would depend on spending , if its gdp proportional or represents a specific % of a nations defence budget it could cripple us just the same as it would essentially cause us to spend more on an army than we otherwise would which in turn would shrink the navy . 
  sorry im not sure what your point is ? 
  http://www.janes.com/article/53114/uk-fighter-numbers-to-reach-all-time-low-with-loss-of-tornados-and-early-typhoons-in-2019 being up sized by 450 men is better than what the other forces are experiencing . 
  and yes the navy is a smaller service because they need less men 10000 men in an army is bugger all but in a navy its a small fleet . 
  for comparison the us navy has 300,000 men to their army 's 1,300,000 . 
  ( * for sake of simplicity i will only include regular personnel ) our navy is around 32,000 our army is 89,000 , we have a higher number of naval personnel to army than the americans . 
  if you did it with european nations i think you 'd find it similarly so . 
  a nation surrounded by water is going to produce more experienced sailors than nations not . 
  its not trash talk . 
  id like to point out i agree ww1 was not an equal fight britain had a vastly more numerous fleet . 
  ww2 was the same , germany has never had much in terms of a surface fleet . 
  the italians on the other hand where a more even match , and faced us more regularly in surface battles than the germans . 
  but jutland is not a case of better german sailors but rather superior german build quality . 
  british gunnery had more modern advanced protocol based on dreyer tables and as a result scored more direct hits however the hits did had little effect , british armour piercing shells inferior quality to german ones . 
  the germans explosive charges in their shells was tnt whereas the british ones where made of lyydite and frequently exploded before piercing a ships armour . 
  the germane admiral hipper later commented `` it was nothing but the poor quality of their bursting charges which saved us from disaster '' that being said initially the germans found their targets more quickly using a ladder system of range finding to the british bracket system . 
  however britain had a more integrated fire control system which allowed it to catch up and maintain its fire accurately despite suffering damage . 
  well ok but in saying `` sailors of inferior quality '' im specifying its the sailor bit that is in question . 
  i do n't think it infers im questioning their worth as human beings , but i guess given that you read it differently than i wrote it my wording was poor . 
  i shall change it to : `` inferior skill '', 
  yes , historically its demonstrable . 
  superior training standards or regularity . 
  prevention of commission buying . 
  or the simple provable fact british sailors spent more time at sea and therefore where more experienced . 
  its also provable that generally until wellington or the grand old duke of york british soldiers where of inferior quality or simply lacked enough quantity to anything of much use against continental powers . 
  each country has their own strengths , why is it hard to believe a nation surrounded by the sea has more experienced sailors ? 
  the its the rn who has the nukes ... also conventionally also it does not come last , history has countless examples of how the rn saved us from invasion .
