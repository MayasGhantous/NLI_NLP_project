  so your excuse for germany 's atrocities in ww2 is `` the uk made us do it ! '' ? 
  loooooooooooooooool, 
   until ww2 i 'd be wary of bringing up ww2 to complain about britain driving apart europe when you 're a german mate . 
  just saying . 
   does it feel good being spied on 24/7 by your fuckin illegitimate government ? 
  it is adorable that you think you are n't being spied upon , lmao . 
   does it feel good being reigned by a fuckin queen who is beloved by your fuckin dumb people ? 
  i do n't really think about it . 
  she brings in a lot of money and she 's a good figurehead for diplomacy so ... yeah ? 
  yet when * certain nations * sell arms to saudi arabia / r/europe throws a shitfit over it . 
  why the fuck for ? 
  this guy is acting like a smartass implying he 'll get me banned and shit cause he thinks he 's uncovered some great secret . 
  i merely responded to the dismissive attitude of some / r/europe users and i 've got , in response : `` england is a shithole '' `` english people are ugly , beer belly and tattoo sporting football hooligans '' `` cry more english bitch '' `` british people have n't got a brain '' . 
  really is quite remarkable . 
   ( please , sing me a lullaby about eu oppression and national sovereignty and all those magic jobs that will appear when the evil polish plumbers are gone ) and the boatloads of moniez that will somehow descend like manna from heaven ) see , what 's all this for ? 
  i 've not said anything of the sort and you 're just putting brexiteer stereotypes in my mouth . 
  you 've made my mind up on what i 've said/am going to say before i 've said anything . 
  this is what makes / r/europe a little bit tiresome . 
  people have a list of brexiteer soundbites in their head and then debate others based on those soundbites instead of what the * individual * is saying . 
  it 's incredible how i made 1 comment and i 've received all this vitriol in response . 
  yeah the maps of `` what irish people think of europe '' are a bit tiring where every nation is `` grand bunch of lads and great craic '' and then there 's just england with `` dirty anglos '' or some shite . 
  i know it 's a joke and everything , just a bit tiring . 
   how is my comment at their throat i did n't mean your comment * specifically * . 
  and yeah i misread , you could maybe make it a bit clearer that you mean in a political sense though for ease of reading . 
  hmm ... on a governmental level yeah i 'd say so , but the average brit is no more concerned with the us than the average american is concerned about the uk in my experience . 
  usually we just get a bit annoyed when the yanks get uppity on the 4th of july and stuff . 
  come on mate , we get enough shit from irish folk on here as it is and comments like this just inflame the situation . 
  it 's unfortunate because i know a ton of irish people in real life and they 're some of the best people i know , yet on here it 's like we 're always at each other 's throats . 
  i 've been guilty of some ireland-bashing in the past but i 'm gon na try and keep a clean slate from now on . 
   the difference is fascinating !, 
   but this is much more entertaining . 
  i know you 're putting on this `` haha , this is so entertaining haha , i 'm only here to fuck about with you haha '' persona but it 's really not a very good look . 
  a ban can be temporary , not permanent . 
  are you dim ? 
  yes , that is what i implied when i said `` what did we do to piss off everybody ? '' . 
  i probably should have put an / s at the end of it . 
  my old reddit account is / u/basednige . 
  i was n't banned from this sub , i simply deleted it and made a new one . 
  nice try though . 
   angrily dismissive yeah ... it seems like so many people on / r/europe are quite quick to anger . 
  you lot need to take up a hobby or something to get rid of that pent up frustration . 
  yeah it 's definitely a very one way relationship . 
  like wales and england . 
  or scotland and england . 
  damn england , what did we do to piss off everybody ? 
  excuse me mate , but someone who just wrote out an entire essay on their views on the uk does n't get to call me whiny . 
  it 's really amazing how all the ugly xenophobia and bigotry comes out when you poke the average / r/europe user . 
  i 've just been debating another guy who ended up coming out with similar stuff . 
  really incredible . 
  i like how i stated you were quite a bigoted and xenophobic individual in another comment and then you just go out and prove it . 
  i do agree , he is a bit of a racist cunt is n't he ? 
  bitter af you are m8, 
  what 's worrying is that you genuinely do post some disgusting xenophobic , bigoted stuff ( particularly about americans and british folk ) but you often get away with it because your fractured english comes off as `` cute '' and funny . 
  for example , he just replied to me with this on another comment  you are english , odds are you probably are a dude with a twisted face , probably some soccer tattoos and a beer belly and an accent so thick that nobody can understand your outside of your neighbour . 
  indeed , indeed . 
  how about you be a good sport and have some grace about it then , instead of acting like - as the gibraltarian leader put it so eloquently - a cuckolded husband . 
  you did n't actually answer anything in my comment , you just spouted some nonsense which can be summed up as `` haha brexit xdd '' . 
  naive / r/europe users , got ta love 'em . 
  i did n't say you needed us , i was just stating that it 's not very beneficial at all for the eu to not have us in it . 
  when you lot go `` haha we do n't actually care so fuck off '' it just comes off as bitter and upset rather than aloof and proud as you intend . 
  i like how the eu is losing ~ 18 % of its economy , its largest and most effective military , the largest intelligence agency which spends more than france , germany , spain and italy put together , one of the world 's financial command centers alongside tokyo and new york , and its arguably biggest leader in soft power and all they can say is `` but ... but ... we do n't actually care about you guys !!! '', 
  while crying into a tissue . 
  you talk like a politically confused teenager , and it seems like everyone else agrees . 
  it 's very easy to dislike her ( ? ) . 
  she posts garbage anyway . 
  along with that french guy with the shit english , / u/batard-sensible or whatever , and / u/new-atlantis . 
  that 's like the shitposting trio . 
  oh oh , and also that isle of man guy with an anger problem . 
  ca n't remember his name off the top of my head unfortunately . 
  this is what europeans actually believe, 
  oh wait , you think because you do n't have a * passport * that means you 're `` barely counted as british '' ? 
  i do n't think so mate . 
  you 're british whether you like it or not , you were literally born on the island of britain . 
  just like how you 're a european because you were born in europe regardless of what you think . 
   you mus n't have much pride in the uk ** either ** oh okay , so you 're one of those `` i hate my own country '' types . 
  you 're perfectly allowed to criticise your own nation but honestly these `` i hate my own nation '' types just come off as depressed and looking to stir shit . 
   you mus n't have much pride in the uk either seeing as your sporting a st georges cross rather than the union flag i am proud of what we have accomplished as a union . 
  i just identify as english first and british second . 
  unfortunately if you say that these days people automatically assume you 're a tattoo sporting hooligan but i digress . 
  since you had a scottish flair i assumed you were scottish and hence from the isle of great britain . 
  my apologies . 
   scotland will be `` free '' ( ??? ), 
  now  maybe `` ireland '' ( ??? 
  lmao ) too, 
  this is what europeans actually believe, 
  you 've got to be the angriest person on this sub by a mile haha, 
  you hate yourself ? 
  `` shackle '' ? 
   mainland nice choice of words bro, 
  what , an overcrowded smoggy shithole ? 
  i 'm glad we do n't . 
  other apes are just so low energy folks , believe me . 
  because england has the best universities in europe and some of the best in the world . 
  oxford , cambridge , lse , imperial . 
  why would you ? 
  if you 're smart enough then british universities are generally better . 
  imperial , lse , oxford and cambridge , durham ( durham only if you want to stay in the uk that is , it 's international rep is kinda weak cause it 's a tiny uni ) are the best universities in europe . 
  people are gon na bang on about `` oh well english speaking universities have an advantage ... '' but it does n't matter . 
  if you want to work in the anglosphere and asia , africa etc , american/british universities will get you further .
