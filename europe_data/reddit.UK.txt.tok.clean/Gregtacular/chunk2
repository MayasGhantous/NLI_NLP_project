   he wanted to know about eton because of former prime ministers yeah i bet he did . 
  every cause he has ever supported politically has lost . 
  he was a big proponent of the euro , ken livingston for mayor , ed miliband ... 
   basic treatment they still do this is only about `` elective surgery '' which is ** non-life-threatening ** . 
  this is for things like gastric bands . 
  it makes total sense . 
  why keep paying for 5 or six surgeries when the person either walks out of the surgery and eats 10 big macs or lights a cigarette ? 
  hardly any of the people who get gastric bands even make any effort prior . 
  anarchists for goldman sachs !, 
  what do we want ? 
  more government !, 
  when do we want it ? 
  now !, 
  funny how only one person ever got one of those laminated cards calling them scum . 
  you would think someone who went to the trouble of printing and laminating them would hand them out to more scum . 
  seems like a big waste of resources . 
  of course , if there was more than one we could actually find out who did it . 
  not as lovely as the people begging `` old white people '' to hurry up and die . 
  those are the real saints . 
  hey , if you think `` libya and syria '' ( where no one died ) are your main arguments for how the tories are the ones who sent troops to die in a desert shithole that 's fine . 
  i still stand by my comment that you called naive , since you have n't actually made a compelling argument that it ** was ** the tories who sent a bunch to die in a desert shithole . 
  you should have thought more critically before you tried to use libya as you example of a tory supported intervention that lead to `` deaths in a desert shithole '' because since then you 've become more belligerent and insulting . 
  how can it be whataboutism when the thing you are complaining about never actually happened ? 
  i did n't say what about , i corrected you . 
  so now the warmongering tories are obviously going to get loads of soldiers killed because `` libya and syria '' where none actually died . 
  ok i said the government that got loads killed in a desert shithole was actually labour and you then said you meant libya and syria ( where no one died ) and now you claim they might still do it . 
  well no shit , you said they might in your first post , and your justification for this is ... that they might in syria ( because libya is actually over ) i do n't give a shit that the tories are actually just as bad , because they are , i just do n't care for this revisionist history where labour are the good guys and the tories are the baddies . 
  libya and syria those famous conflicts we sent hundreds of soldiers to die in ? 
  did n't your initial post lament hiring soldiers who would only die for the tories in a desert shithole ? 
  and that we should focus on something other than `` boots on the ground '' ? 
  correct me if i 'm being ignorant but we never sent troops to die there ? 
  the only recorded casualty from libya was an airman who died in an accident in italy . 
  say what you want about italy but it 's no distant desert shithole . 
  i would hardly describe most of those spats as `` sending them off to die in some distant desert shitthole '' which again , you were clearly referencing a particular conflict which has now completely soured the public 's willingness to involve ourselves in the middle east at all . 
  first gulf war was hardly a disaster and lasted a few months . 
  sure , i 'll concede that . 
  well no i was n't born in 1700 . 
  pretty clear we are talking about post ww2 , and you were clearly referencing a particular conflict . 
  the only `` distant desert shitthole '' was the iraq , afghan cock-up . 
  i just keep seeing this meme being pushed by people ( usually labour supporters ) that the evil nhs hating tories are the ones frothing at the gash to send soldiers to die in the middle eaast over oil . 
  why is that relevant ? 
   empower the tories to send them off to die in some distant desert shitthole . 
  you say that but the only government that ever did that was a labour one . 
  the barekini . 
  yes , exaggerating but it 's more complicated than that . 
  the queen in the play is based ( loosely ) on gertrude , and she promised her husband she would never remarry but she actually did in real life , well real in the play not the play within a play . 
  so she is saying that the queen in the play is exaggerating her feelings for her dying husband so much and it 's obvious she will find a new husband . 
  at least that is how i see it . 
  it 's how the saying is used anyway . 
  former pm who is famous for lying about wmd for the iraq war ? 
  the same former pm who promised a referendum on the treaty of lisbon but never gave one before ratifying it ? 
  the former pm who was clearly promised a top position in the eu and wants to be president ? 
  if you want to argue against `` morons '' it would help if you avoid making things up like you did in your first post . 
  the `` supreme motherfucking legislative body '' handed it 's decision over to the public in the referendum . 
  you sound like the one pretending , clinging on to anything you can to deny what is clearly happening . 
   random tuss decided to go haywire charming . 
  i like how you frame following the outcome of the referendum as going haywire . 
  and looking at the current polls for the political parties it looks like the party supporting the result is way ahead of the one arguing and trying to block it . 
  how do you know what future generations want btw ? 
  it 's a common expression used when someone obviously feels one way but continually insists the opposite just like the queen in the play . 
  i 'm implying that by talking about how much he ca n't wait for us to leave is compensation for his true feelings . 
  i was n't being pedantic , pedantic would be correcting your spelling of * trait . 
  your entire premise was that it had been pushed back `` multiple '' times and most of the pushbacks you listed were entirely false , as i stated . 
   sharpen your wits says the guy who ca n't even figure out who he is talking to . 
  you got mad because you were wrong , then you confused me for someone else and got mad again when i pointed it out . 
  like i said , just get over it . 
   you want to feel superior , go talk to a dog . 
  you will do just fine , despite your rage you are pretty funny . 
  you were hostile from the start and only got worse . 
  what , did a british guy sleep with your mother ? 
  i 'm not even british so save your rage for someone else . 
   not a real point it is , especially in the context of your initial comment . 
  that 's all i said and you started throwing insults and going into a frenzy . 
  i politely asked you to stop being so antagonistic . 
  if you would have obliged maybe we could have discussed something of substance but you do n't seem capable . 
  you were wrong get over it . 
  i have n't gone on and on about anything , you are the one going on and on about stuff you do n't care about . 
  you keep writing huge paragraphs repeating yourself over an over . 
  i will say one thing , you are very creative with your displays of butthurt . 
  it 's almost like a theatre but with added insults . 
   i read the articles , you admitted they exist , but claim they came from the remain camp as scare tactics . 
  looking at your other posts on here , it seems in your fit of rage you seem to have confused me with someone else . 
  none of that makes sense with regards to what i corrected you on . 
  you are losing touch with reality . 
  you already look like a fool i 'm afraid . 
  would you rather they pretend nothing is happening ? 
  france is still in state of emergency , fran\u00e7ois holland mentioned the new security measures for schools and the government released a document detailing the new measures . 
  the french government is obviously taking measures to prevent further attacks , considering the scale and number of attacks already . 
  i do n't see how the bbc is fear mongering any more than the government . 
  they would n't be able to release articles like that ( which are truthful ) so often if this stuff was n't happening . 
  there is no need to be so antagonistic . 
  you said something that is easily proven false . 
  take the loss and move on . 
  you seem incredibly upset about all of this despite your claims . 
  what was that line from shakespeare ? 
  `` the lady doth protest too much , methinks '', 
   western lies !, 
  europe strong !, 
  this is almost getting to russian levels . 
  ironically the bbc is incredibly pro-eu .
