we can still have european union migrants when we leave . 
  all the top comments are anti-eu and anti-mass immigration . 
  do n't you feel a little out of touch with your fellow britons ? 
  prepare to have your mind blown , / r/europe : we can still have eu migrants when we leave , is n't that amazing ? 
  we 'd also be able to control the quality and the number , immigration would be a respectable thing again , like after ww2 when migrants helped rebuild war-torn britain . 
  i 've never said such a thing , mate . 
  i just want a sensible immigration policy is all . 
   unbearable you find opposing views unbearable ? 
  also , what 's a ' / pol/ack ' ? 
  based fn . 
  i 'm glad western europe appears to be doing something about our kebab problem . 
  i kinda envy you , france . 
  you 're lucky to have such a based political party . 
  this is like another shoah . 
   `` i know it 's the flag of europe , but it 's now synonymous with the eussr and it 's not a flag you can respect . 
  europe needs a new flag . '', 
  why was this deleted ? 
  it 's something i agree with . 
  i guess he was being a bit too provocative with the `` eussr '' bit ? 
  if you vote incorrectly you have to vote again , i remember something similar with ireland . 
  such is life with the eussr . 
  unfortunately he was being sarcastic , he should though . 
  i would if i were swedish . 
  it 's also missing diversity . 
  :( sweden could be brown at least . 
  i was supporting them too , i 'm just saying this is germany 's win not europe 's as a whole . 
  glad a european country won , though lets not selfishly get in on their victory . 
  this is a win for germany alone , not europe as a whole . 
  congrats germany . 
  so you 're a fan of direct democracy ? 
  me too !, 
  do you agree the uk should have a referendum on the eu ? 
  in short , if you deny jews the right to mutilate children you 're an anti-semite !, 
   `` to learn who rules over you , simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize . '' - voltaire, 
  i would assume so , yes . 
  what 's your point ? 
   well , it 's pretty clear that that is meant to be read as ` between commenters in / r/europe well , it should say so . 
  even so , why should n't you be able to call someone a moron for their opinions on / r/europe ? 
  i was quoting [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2a2iqd/modpost_a_reminder_of_our_rules_and_guidelines/cir5som ) . 
  i was just making a point about the `` do n't be rude '' rule . 
   moron stop citizen , the moderator explicitly said `` personal attacks , name calling and insults '' are forbidden here . 
  we should be welcoming to everyone , even unpopular people . 
  great [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmuzrhwmkmu ) on the subject . 
   the reason for your permaban is that you are a racist/white supremacist and moderator of more than 50 subreddits that almost exclusively revolve around this one single topic . 
  he was banned for having unpopular opinions outside of / r/europe , really ? 
   please do n't be ( intentionally ) rude at all . 
  what constitutes as rude ? 
  hurting someone 's feelings ? 
  controversial opinion ? 
  complaining about immigration laws ? 
  anything the moderators do n't like ? 
  it 's such a subjective rule . 
  honestly , what does it matter as long as it 's on-topic ? 
  instead of making / r/europe a hugbox , why do n't you at least try to value free speech ? 
  ah , sweden , the rape capital of europe . 
  you guys must be loving the enrichment . 
  i have celtic dna myself , i 'm a carrier of the `` celtic curse '' gene , the fact is celts , angles , saxons , romans , and so on are all closely related . 
  you wo n't have to go that far back to find a common ancestor compared to africans or asians . 
  we 're all a little bit racist . 
  why ? 
  it 's a natural instinct , it 's as natural as breathing . 
  even the most insufferable lefties would prefer a homogeneous over a multicultural group in the event of a zombie apocalypse , not that you 'd be picky in that situation . 
  we evolved separately for thousands of years , we 're a global minority , and i identify as a white person . 
  it would be a shame to see my kinsmen become minorities in their own countries , which has already happened in some of our capital cities . 
  somehow this is controversial and viewed as racist , but if you said `` i would like south africa to remain majority black . '', 
  or `` i would like israel to remain majority jewish . '', 
  it 's perfectly acceptable , why ? 
  unpopular opinion : culture aside , i would like europe to remain majority white . 
  as a ukip supporter , i respect the greens , they appear to be open and honest , and they trust the general public with a vote on eu membership despite their pro-eu stance . 
  # 55 million per day is correct , but after we deduct the money we get back it 's closer to # 33 million per day . 
  the money we get back is more like vouchers tbh , we do n't decide what that money is spent on , also we have to promote the eu because they gave us some of our own money back in the form of vouchers . 
  there are no trade benefits from the eu : [ no uk trade benefit from eu membership - civitas report ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27284489 ), 
  citation needed . 
  considering the # 55,000,000 a day we give to the eu , yes , it 's worth every penny to have ukip in the ep . 
  glad to see ukip are representing my dissatisfaction of the eu . 
  millions of citizens across europe voted for eurosceptics . 
  this protest was representing the views of those that voted for ukip . 
  i guess you do n't respect the votes of eurosceptics ? 
  yes , it 's disrespectful to the eu , it was supposed to be . 
  i do n't see how it 's disrespectful to europe as a whole , care to explain ? 
  proud of ukip and i 'm glad i voted for them . 
  islam is a religion , what has race/ethnicity got to do with anything ? 
  how are they going to recoup the losses i wonder , charge non-roaming users more ? 
  it would have to apply to all face coverings so i 'm on the fence about it . 
  i 'd love to see burkas banned without it applying to other face coverings though . 
  but he clearly was n't speaking for you , nor did he imply that he was speaking for other britons . 
  he was merely stating an opinion . 
  he believes we ( britain ) do n't need to be part of europe and that we ( britain ) should just go back to trade agreements . 
  you are being pedantic over the use of ` we ' . 
  he clearly meant ` we ' as in ` britain ' :  britain does n't need to be part of europe , britain should just go back to trade agreements . 
  stop being pedantic . 
  europhiles also use ` we ' in this way , i 'm sure you do n't correct them . 
   til sweden is positively surrounded by muslim countries . 
  i was talking about the eu , but yes , they 're not that far away from sweden compared to america . 
   oh , do tell , do n't leave us all hanging !, 
  i 'll let you use your imagination , i 'm sure you 'll get it right . 
   ed miliband said the uk was now `` closer to the exit door '' in europe and i could n't be more happy . 
  ca n't wait to leave . 
  must only be filtered with ` got ' on the end of ` fag ' , that or a moderator deleted my post , which i doubt because it was so quick . 
  needless to say , i 'm not happy about the censorship .
