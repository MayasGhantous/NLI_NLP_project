  filtering does n't work because it completely depends on the context . 
  north america does n't have muslim countries on their doorstep , they have a similar but different problem , but i 'm reluctant to say what it is , / r/europe might hate me for it . 
  using cunt as an insult is derogatory to females in the same way using the f-slur as an insult is derogatory to gay people . 
  be a little more sensitive , man . 
  unfortunately , i had to censor the f-slur because it 's filtered . 
  cunt is derogatory to females , cunt . 
  unfortunately , in the not too distant future , europe will be an islamic continent because people like you do n't value your own culture enough to want to protect it . 
  israel seems to be preserving its culture pretty well , you do n't see them opening their borders and going all multicultural . 
  why ? 
  because their culture would be destroyed . 
  do you believe israel should open its borders and go down the root of multiculturalism so their culture can `` evolve '' ? 
  i do , but not for the same reasons as you . 
  what happened to your belief that the general public are too stupid to vote and everything should be left up to parliament ? 
  admit it , you just do n't want to leave the european union , therefore , you do n't want a referendum because there 's a chance we might vote `` incorrectly . '', 
  i 'm sure you 'd like a public vote on , let me think , what do you lefties like that the general public would likely vote for ? 
  the legalisation of cannabis ? 
  they 're all more or less calling for a public vote , you say a public vote is wrong . 
  how are you not saying they 're wrong ? 
  out of curiousity , do you support the scottish referendum ? 
  ukip , the greens , and the conservatives all support a referendum . 
  labour and the liberal democrats support a referendum if more powers are transferred . 
  are our elected representatives wrong too ? 
  what makes your views right and the `` general idiots '' views wrong ? 
  good . 
  maybe cameron can stop pretending to be a eurosceptic and actually become one , maybe ed and nick will trust the british people with a vote on the eu too . 
  this is actually good if you 're a eurosceptic , this [ article ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-eurosceptics-hope-jeanclaude-juncker-will-claim-ec-presidency-and-push-britain-out-of-europe-9560648.html ) explains it well . 
  their interests and the eu 's interests are n't the same thing . 
  they 're a member of the eu , they 're not the eu . 
  they 're in the eu , yes . 
  i do n't get what your point is . 
  we 're all thinking the same thing , even you staunch leftists . 
  let your pc mask slip for once . 
  your country 's politicians are n't spineless , they 're putting austria 's own interests first . 
  bending over backwards for the eu would be spineless . 
  only the liberals want further integration , the conservatives and labour do n't . 
  conservatives have promised a referendum , labour have promised a referendum if more powers are transferred . 
  i 'll be voting conservative only because i live in a strong tory area , if ukip stood a chance i 'd vote ukip . 
  also , the conservatives are n't pro-eu . 
  all their mps either want reform or for us to leave . 
  they 're not gon na vote for someone that is a pro-eu if they want less integration , are they now ? 
  the british public decide by voting for representatives that share the same views . 
   most of the uk 's trade is with the eu and the british isles are right next to europe . 
  are you suggesting we 're gon na stop trading with europe if we left the political union , especially when we import more than we export ? 
   [ no uk trade benefit from eu membership ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27284489 ), 
  [ the eurozone crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurozone_crisis ) . 
  i 'd like to know why you think countries are benefiting from the eurozone , that is simply false . 
  also , why do n't you think the uk has a future outside the eu ? 
  smaller countries are managing fine , iceland , a country with a population of 320,137 , secured a free trade deal with china . 
  the majority of the british public do n't want further integration , the majority want either reform ( for less integration ) or for us to leave . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/21/eu-referendum-majority-leave-opinium-observer-poll so it 's not happening anytime soon , thankfully . 
  i do n't want ukip to do anything that would negatively affect them , but i would like to see fn join the efd group because i unashamedly share a lot of fn 's views . 
  i 'd like this too , only because the drama would be entertaining . 
  no need for damage control , you ca n't just dismiss a eurosceptic party topping the polls as `` b-but the majority voted for other parties !, 
  '' , the fact is , fn won . 
  i 'm serious . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_race  nordicism , also `` nordic theory , '' is an ideology of racial supremacy that claims that a nordic race , within the greater caucasian race , constituted a master race . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] this ideology was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in some central and northern european countries as well as in north america , and it achieved some further degree of mainstream acceptance throughout germany via nazism . 
  what went wrong ? 
  edit : i do n't get why my comment was deleted , the nordic people were considered the epitome of the white race , but okay . 
  did you forget that , fn , a eurosceptic party , topped the polls in the european elections ? 
  it was a request , it was n't an order . 
  france is free to fly whatever flags they want . 
  most people would rather see their nations ' flags flown instead of the eu , do n't make the mistake of thinking / r/europe is representative of the people of europe , it 's not , thankfully . 
  this place is full of eu fanatics . 
  you have to remember , not everyone is as enthusiastic about the eu as / r/europe is . 
  eurosceptics topped the polls in countries other than the uk , you lot seem to think euroscepticism is limited to the uk , it 's not . 
  it would be an insult to those that died to fly the eu flag . 
  they did n't die for the eu , they died for their homelands . 
  i ca n't wait for the eu to fall apart . 
  in what way does it hurt the sellers ? 
  stds ? 
  buyers are also at risk of stds . 
  the reason ** independent ** prostitutes are prostitutes is personal gain and just like selling drugs you ca n't blame the `` market '' for your acts . 
  ** independent ** prostitutes choose to be prostitutes because they see it as easy money , of course they have free will . 
  which is fine because i believe prostitution should be legal and regulated . 
  prostitution is the oldest profession , it 's not going away anytime soon , those `` structures '' you speak of have existed in society since the dawn of man . 
  it 's hypocritical to punish the buyer and not the seller whatever the reason , either legalise it or punish the supplier . 
  why is punishing drug dealers better than punishing the buyers ? 
  neither should be punished , but if we 're going to be punishing anyone it makes sense to punish the supplier more than the demand . 
  this is just another example of / r/pussypass . 
  the majority of suppliers in prostitution are women , therefore , the insufferably progressive countries punish the demand instead . 
  dark green being the best approach , pink being the worst . 
  are we counting turkey as a european country ? 
  if so , turkey , for obvious reasons . 
  if not , sweden , also for obvious reasons . 
  your sarcastic side sounds quite reasonable , you should be sarcastic more often . 
   0/10 for trying yeah , because any opinion different to your own must be a troll , right ? 
  sorry to disappoint you , but it 's how i honestly feel about the eu . 
  i suppose this is a good thing for eurosceptics , if juncker gets the job we will see an increase in euroscepticism . 
  i ca n't wait for us to leave the eussr . 
  the joys of third world immigrants , do n't you just love the enrichment ? 
  as a eurosceptic , i hope we get a muslim president . 
  more fuel for the fire . 
  uk , yes , just to show we 're not the usa 's bitch , but that will never happen . 
  i 'm sure there would be something in our extradition laws with the us that would allow snowden asylum . 
  as a eurosceptic i 'd like to see more countries join , any will do . 
  it will stir up more euroscepticism , therefore increase our chances of leaving . 
  populist or not , something is seriously wrong when politicians do n't trust the general public to decide who governs them by refusing to give them a referendum on the eu . 
  they 're a symptom of an underlying problem and i will be voting ukip again at the general elections . 
   in order to receive jobseeker 's allowance ( and many other benefits ) you need to have worked in the uk for at least 1 year , what ?
