you mean such as when they were forced to destroy hard drives by uk agents ? 
  ... which was literally reported by uk news ? 
  bonus points if you personally read about it on the guardian itself , because that would be hilarious . 
  to be fair , criticism has moved to the quality of many of these jobs and the stagnating/falling wages of jobs for some time now . 
  more than half of the articles posted here that complain about the state of something in the uk are from our own papers or blogs . 
  honestly , you 're posting this on a subreddit where a huge portion of links are english language news from uk based websites and you did n't notice this ? 
  you 're kind of missing the point ... the whole topic of grey areas on the subject ( eg . 
  context , soil vs. target , domestic support ) is probably why the glorious revolution has similarly not been included on the map , which is what i was playing on . 
  just as how the western europe campaign is not included for obvious reasons . 
  but anyways , expanding on your note , [ liberation and invasion are not exclusive ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion ) , although the target is germany : `` an invasion is a military offensive in which large parts of combatants of one geopolitical entity aggressively enter territory controlled by another such entity , generally with the objective of either conquering , liberating or re-establishing control or authority over a territory ... '', 
  we 'll agree to that , but in return france , belgium and the netherlands gets usa , uk and canadian flag for the normandy landings and western campaign in 1944-45 . 
  deal ? 
  so long as our score is just slightly higher than france , we 'll build as many panels as necessary even if they 're in cloud/rain/fog . 
   maybe there is prejudice against gingers in england because what are you basing this assertion on ? 
  personal experience from being here ? 
  because , interestingly enough , the vast majority of ginger jokes that i have witnessed myself were either from watching south park or further jokes based on those of south park . 
  note how crap the england team is nowadays , and then note the fact that at least the england team got into the world cup ... 
  if you 've got serious reasons , fair game . 
  but it 's worth noting that this is not like supporting a sports team ( not saying that 's how it is , but just in case that 's the attitude ) . 
  a lot of people are going to be annoyed/disappointed whichever way it swings . 
  it 's not as simple as just `` westminster treating scotland like shit '' - there are countless english people who feel a similar way about their regions . 
  if westminster does absolutely nothing in response it wo n't just be scots who will be even more pissed off . 
  at the same time , i kind of want that threat to be a real possibility . 
  that way there is enough incentive to get our government actually doing something such as some kind of political reform - not just for scotland , but for the other regions of the uk as well . 
  whether there was permission/agreement or not is not the fundamental difference at play here . 
  let me put it this way with an example : there would be a difference between if texas withdrew from the usa and if the usa split up into all 50 states . 
  in the first case the usa still exists - sans 1 state . 
  in the other , the usa ceases to exist and all 50 states are independent - ie . 
  the union has been dissolved . 
  no more usa , just 50 individual states . 
  in the former case , the usa is not considered to be a new entity just because one state has seceded , it is still considered to be the usa . 
  other nations do not start considering it to be a newly born country ( in the same way that you do n't get a new country every time one changes its borders - notice how ukraine is not a new country just because it lost crimea ) . 
  instead it is texas that is considered to be the new independent entity . 
  this kind of distinction should be trivial to understand . 
  oh no , i do n't think it is even a common view at all . 
  but it was a funny thought of someone actually answering that way that popped into my mind for some reason . 
  this is * exactly * the video i was thinking of as well !, 
  ( for the fox news side of it , of course ) . 
  it could be really inaccurate to how it went down in reality , but for the netherlands i like to imagine a lot of the people saying ` no ' to be diehard conservatives or family types who hear about the netherlands and go , `` wait , is n't that where there 's all the ** prostitutes ** and ** drugs ** everywhere ? 
  there 's no way we 're going there ! '', 
  because that happens to be all they think they know about the place . 
  i think that the best i 've ever paid for a ticket was a couple of times about a year ago : student discounts + 2 for 1 tickets = it was about # 3 or so per ticket for each of us . 
  you do n't seem to understand the difference between secession of a member from a union and disintegration of a union . 
  i strongly suggest that you read up the difference between the two . 
  i think that most on this map did n't ` declare independence ' in that sense either . 
  to be more accurate it 's really a map of former uk colonies/protectorates . 
  i guess it 's pretty good if you manage to land an ultra high-paid professional or a big firm job - if you make more than enough money for your wages to power over the insane price to quality ratio the uk market has ( esp . 
  london ) you can have a very comfortable lifestyle here . 
  it 's the movers such as those who do n't land that great a job and then scramble for central london especially that really confuse me . 
  just to afford to live there they surely have to put up with the absolute shittiest accommodation for one thing - why would you want to subject yourself to that ? 
  but there are people willingly buying the cupboards that they 're advertising as flats now for sure . 
  personally my preference the red fox . 
  most people would say classical choices like lion , bulldog . 
  but in all honesty bulldogs are ridiculous and lions are overdone with loads of countries ( plus they are n't even native here ) . 
  on the other hand a fox is native and sums up ` perfidious albion ' much better , at least classical stereotypes wise . 
  as for the whole `` what about that fox hunting thing '' that used to be legal ? 
  well who says we are n't a little self-deprecating . 
  i would have thought the entire ranking spot for london would be related to reasonable affordable housing - which is the actual issue that london ( at least central ) actually faces in my opinion . 
  in many cases demand is so strong that you are forced to buy/rent a poor quality property or you can get a really nice place but only if you throw ridiculous money around . 
  reading about all this focus on number of protests ( i 'm even assuming they include mostly peaceful ones ? ), 
  and the 2011 riots instead just reeks of bullshit to me . 
  pretty much the same for my family and i , and a lot of people i 'm sure . 
  they 're worth visiting for being beautiful , historical and impressive , even if we do n't hold any religious belief ourselves . 
  [ hey guys , can i join ? 
  am i doing it right ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/mounted.police.buckingham.palace.arp.jpg ), 
  seems to depend a lot on area . 
  i 've never seen the one in op 's picture . 
  i usually see : [ the volvo estate ] ( http://www.4dcre8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/01volvopolicecar.jpg ) , [ bmw traffic cars ] ( http://www.automotorblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/bmw-uk-police-livery.jpg ) or the astra for the basic patrol car , as you said . 
  nowadays the police in my region seem to be moving even more towards bmws , because i 've also started seeing [ bmw estates ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8376/8457284435_ba80abab6f.jpg ) and , in london at least , [ the suv models ] ( http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8014/7667118356_611488249d.jpg ) a lot more . 
  unfortunately it 's very poor quality , but [ took this just now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zsaqzq5.jpg ) . 
  it 's in hertfordshire , england . 
  [ northern irish loyalists . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eleventh_night ), 
  should i walk around roma camps and start hating romanians ? 
  or go around the ghetto and start hating americans ? 
  i do n't think that is a fair way to judge people . 
  sorry , it was actually a pay monthly setup . 
  i fixed that . 
  but no , i do n't agree with it at all , and i would n't defend it ( to clarify , i 'm not defending it - just stating how it is for me and from what i know ) . 
  for one thing i do n't agree with how useless and what a colossal waste of effort it all is , which i suspect that the isps know but feel obligated to go along with it . 
  not only are filters easy to circumvent , but [ people do n't care about them anyway . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28440067 ) about accessing a torrent website ... it took about 5 seconds . 
  i just googled ` proxybay ' , clicked one of the links - job done . 
  case in point about how much of a waste of time someone trying to block that was . 
  i got a new mobile pay monthly sim with three less than a month ago , and nothing is blocked . 
  i did n't do anything by default - it just came that way . 
  are you * sure * you did n't accidentally agree to enable mature content filtering when you signed up ? 
  plus from what everybody has told me about the isps , it 's also nearly always a selection thing when installing . 
  during install you should disable it in configurations or say no if it 's a prompt . 
  how they handle filters is specific to the isp . 
  yeah but then there would be less queuing for each one . 
  i already wanted to tap out as soon as i read , `` the sky 's alive with cranes '' . 
  oh no ... construction is booming . 
  healthy demand for development in * my * city ? 
  but construction cranes are so ugly - how dare they !, 
  i 'm wondering what it 'd look like if it were split into england , wales , scotland and ni . 
  i got welsh , australian and south african and i 'm from west hertfordshire . 
   dude the luftwaffe was destroying the raf . 
  this is simply not true .
