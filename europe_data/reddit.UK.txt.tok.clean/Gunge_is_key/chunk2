  there is a bit more to it than that however . 
  governments have mandates . 
  you might argue that mays mandate was the brexit vote ( this is not what is in dispute ) . 
  mays mandate is essentially the opposite of camerons so there should have been an election , we should have been able to decide witch party was going to represent us and we should have been given a choice of approach . 
  the tories are going beyond their remit while at the same time creating a version of brexit that is harmful to those who voted for it . 
  the poor did not vote to be poorer , they were lead to believe brexit would lead to a fairer society . 
  `` but that 's what the people want and you have to respect that '' reading this kind of off hand comment is incredibly infuriating for me . 
  what you advocate is not democracy , it is a tyranny of the majority . 
  52 % of people were convinced that voting to leave was in our best interests . 
  a few corrupt and unscrupulous people manage to get the mob behind them by lying ( and later admitting to have lied ) so 48 % of the nations wishes and needs for what kind of brexit is enacted no longer matters ? 
  its not just idiocy , its a dangerous idea . 
  `` lest you 've become what you hate the most ... ? '', 
  - i assume you mean an authoritarian , thought i am confused as to what point you think you are making . 
  hard brexit is being enacted by an unelected rightwing government . 
  they are using this as an opportunity to decrease funding from every public institution and destroy the national health service . 
  we are the most watched people in the world and the government have stated that they will no longer abide by the european convention on human rights . 
  if i had become what i fear most i 'd be a lot less afraid right now . 
  istanbul yes turkey no, 
  things and food cost more , there are more racist attacks ( people feel vindicated in their fear and hatred ) , we have less exchange students and young people coming from other places , our national health service is in crisis , everywhere is loosing funding and we find ourselves having to be nice to trump and excepting whatever he says . 
  it is not a good time to be british, 
  in my nation their was a pervading fear of loosing our sovereignty and identity . 
  many people truly believed that if we did n't leave the eu we would be agreeing to form a us of e . it was very hard to argue the case for staying in the eu because most of the media and the mob were against it . 
  i personally wish we had not left and would have liked to see ever closer union . 
  our history and the diverse heritages of our communities makes many older people feel uneasy as they feel that we have already lost our identity to globalism ( perhaps we should have stayed on our island rather than attempting to rule the world ) . 
  we are also not enthusiastic about becoming more like the usa . 
  i think one day we will ask to join again . 
  i hope it does n't take a war to make us see the eus benefits . 
  educated people from all over the world . 
  i have never been but i imagine a newer looking london with slightly more asians and slightly less europeans . 
  the government , the opposition , the banks and most of my fellow citizens . 
  lol nope, 
  ... good ? 
  i doubt your speaking from a position of authority though . 
  what motivates people to acts of organised violence more than anything is perceived grievance and propaganda that lets them blame their troubles on another group . 
  can you imagine how much angrier the kippers would be if we took their win away from them now that they are so close . 
  how many patriots would see that as a betrayal rather than a pardon of execution ? 
  if we manage to stay in the eu there will be a new kind on sectarian violence in the uk . 
  i personally would rather engage in a low level civil war than leave the eu . 
  call me a europhile, 
  but the article is about profiling north africans on nye so a to avoid the sexual attacks on women that happened last year . 
  in this specific case a few high raking administrators and police thought north africans ( a cultural group ) were the problem . 
  perhaps there is more than one problem at any one time . 
  ok , i will try to remember that . 
  westerners do only tend to encounter mid eastern and north africans and it is the birth place of islam . 
  i see that the term muslim nations is problematic and will be more careful with its use in the future . 
  if the point you wish to defend is that all nations have different cultural norms i fear you will find few people to fight against my friend . 
  it is fine to dislike generalizations , however i feel your opposition is slightly pedantic in this case . 
  i will however concede that their are indeed many muslims who drink despite it being un-islamic . 
  as i have said , i consider the term `` islamic nations '' to apply to nations dominated by islam . 
  this map i found on google images is an ok example - http://www.islamproject.org/images/muslim_2000_final.jpg it is similar to someone saying christian nations and not meaning to include south korea even though technically their are slightly more christians than buddhists in south korea . 
  or someone saying christian nations and including my own country despite the largest group at present being the unaffiliated/agnostics . 
  the distinction here does not seem very important . 
  `` muslim nations ** tend ** not to have the binge drinking problems ** many ** western nations do . '', 
  qualifying words matter . 
  they change the meaning of the statement . 
  i do not think all muslims should be treated with contempt and profiled as rapists . 
  i believe north africans ( of witch most are muslim ) do not treat women with the respect required by europeans . 
  we ( western liberals ) must accommodate this hideous generalization if we are to protect our cultures from the less respectable aspects of some islamic cultures , that are propagated by citizens of these nations that have emigrated to europe . 
  nor would i wish to . 
  as far as i 'm concerned all parties are damned by their actions here , including this reactionary article that seeks to capitalize on our division as it exacerbates the problem . 
  do you think muslims drink as much as christians ? 
  forgive me for lumping disparate groups of people together under their chosen religion again but it seems to me that if you wanted to be a good muslim abstinence is rather important . 
  perhaps i am wrong , the only muslims who drink with me are lapsed muslims . 
  `` it 's not different than saying christian countries would n't have pre-martial sex or at least have so little of it , while it 's not true at all . '', 
  i think it is a little different . 
  their are no christian nations where pre-marital sex is illegal . 
  in my own country for hundreds of years it was vaguely taboo as it is in many muslims nations today , but it was n't illegal . 
  also : - `` a 2014 pew study on global morality found that premarital sex was considered particularly unacceptable in `` predominantly muslim nations '' , such as indonesia , jordan , pakistan and egypt , each having over 90 % disapproval , while people in western european countries were the most accepting , with spain , germany and france expressing less than 10 % disapproval . '', 
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/premarital_sex forgive me if i 'm wrong but i believe that turkey , albania and bosnia are secular countries . 
  in afghanistan , bangladesh , brunei , iran , kuwait , libya and saudi arabia it is illegal to invibe alcohol and many other substances so people do not enjoy them in pubic . 
  `` muslim nations ** tend ** not to have the binge drinking problems ** many ** western nations do . '', 
  this is an example given along side my original remark . 
  `` you do n't have to hate ** north africans ** to understand that some problems are based on the culture your born into . '', 
  though a majority of muslim nations are not good places to live if you are a woman i do not claim all of them are . 
  neither the west nor the muslims world are homologous or united , i never calmed that . 
  but in washington and in montevideo , in london and in moscow a man or a woman can get wasted and fuck a random stranger consensualy and legally . 
  it is harder to do that in any islamic nation . 
  a man stole . 
  a man tried to stop him . 
  the thief died senselessly and the cook will be imprisoned . 
  based on the race of these two men the shop was stoned and 28 `` violent protesters '' were arrested . 
  were the drinks stolen because the cook was tunisian ? 
  was the thief stabbed because he was a pole ? 
  i doubt it . 
  you confuse me . 
  i did not suggest that all islamic countries are united . 
  in islam alcohol is haraam ( forbidden ) . 
  countries run according to the teachings of islam are less likely to have normalized heavy drinking as part of their culture , because in most cases it is prohibited . 
  the same is not true in the west . 
  you sighted bosnia . 
  bosnia is 51 % muslim 46 % christian 3 % jewish according to google . 
  i would consider a muslim nation to be one where islam is almost a mono-culture , like tunisia : 99 % sunni 1 % christians , jews , baha'is and shia muslims . 
  you can compare groups of countries with the same religion . 
  what you should n't do is talk about them as if they are all the same nation . 
  in order to avoid this you should talk about specific ways in witch they are similar or dissimilar , as i have done . 
  `` not all muslims are arabs or southeast asians ... '' ... yes , i know . 
  ... yeah me to . 
  i 'm sure many muslims would agree with you and i, 
  you do n't have to hate north africans to understand that some problems are based on the culture your born into . 
  muslim nations tend not to have the binge drinking problems many western nations do .
