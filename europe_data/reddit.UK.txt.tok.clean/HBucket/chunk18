  do n't you think that it adds a little spice to the proceedings ? 
  think of it like a marriage : you need the kind of excitement that can only come when you 're screaming and throwing things at each other . 
  now you 're making me want the uk to stay in the eu . 
  we can scream and spit venom at each other for ever and ever . 
  would n't that be fun ? 
   and as long as there 's a welfare state the pull factor is huge . 
  not if you ensure that these migrants do n't have access to it . 
  you can maintain welfare provision for your own people while denying it to those who turn up uninvited . 
  bear in mind that most of these migrants are african and are from countries that are poor , yet peaceful . 
  so refugee camps are a red herring . 
  very few of these people are refugees . 
  if you want to stop these people , remove the pull factors . 
  border security can only get you so far . 
  you have to ensure that these people wo n't be able to get jobs , housing , healthcare , education , civil rights , etc. 
  make it so that they face poverty equal to that of their home countries and they wo n't even want to come . 
  until european countries are willing to do that , the flow will carry on . 
   the uk feels itself as architect of european affairs i do n't think that 's ever been the case since the hundred years war . 
  the british mentality towards europe has always been more of a `` here be dragons '' thing . 
  we 've only ever got involved to prevent europe from uniting against us . 
  other than that , we 've always tended to leave them well alone . 
  a few things off the top of my head : geography . 
  our geographic separation from continental europe has resulted in us being less influenced by political and legal changes there . 
  the best example is probably with our legal system . 
  britain and ireland have a common law system ( except for scotland which has a kind of hybrid system ) , while the rest of europe ( except for the former british colonies of cyprus and malta ) is governed by civil law . 
  then there 's our history of not having a codified constitution . 
  we 've been insulated from many of the political upheavals that influenced europe , which has enabled us to develop somewhat differently . 
  language plays a part . 
  we 're almost completely monolingual and culturally we tend to look over the atlantic more than the channel . 
  economics . 
  we 're a major net contributor to the eu 's budget so that will naturally sway a lot of people against the orginsation . 
  germany is more willing to pay due to war guilt , but british people ( outside of middle class liberal circles ) do n't really have a sense of historical guilt . 
  immigration . 
  we 're mainly a destination country , which has resulted in many british people becoming very sceptical of the benefits of free movement across europe . 
  especially in recent years . 
  suspicion of grand ideas probably plays a part too . 
  british people tend to have very little time for grandiose political projects . 
  if you try to impress onto a typical british person the great historical mission of a united europe , their eyes will glaze over and their mind will wonder . 
  we have little time for big ideas . 
  it 's the same reason why british people tend not to care much for philosophy , it 's far more of an abstract continental thing . 
  you have to explain to people the simple material benefits of eu membership anbd that 's something that the proponents of eu membership have failed to do very well . 
  there 's really no single big thing that can explain the prevalence of british euroscepticism . 
  it 's more about the little things , and it 's the little things that all add up . 
  i do n't think that really explains it . 
  we have over 12 times the population of norway , which results in oil and gas not being of huge importance to the uk economy as a whole . 
  the collapse in oil prices has badly damaged the north sea oil industry , but that has been easily offset by the benefits to every other sector of the economy . 
  there are other factors at play that contribute to euroscepticism . 
  this . 
  you have to remember that arseholes like me are n't representative of the british population as a whole . 
  indeed we will . 
  eu institutions are pretty weak and pathetic when a country actually decides to stand up to them . 
  it will be great fun . 
  in the uk `` eu politician '' and `` household name '' are mutually exclusive terms . 
  people are largely indifferent to european politics here . 
  we hear more about the us presidential primaries on the news . 
   [ it 's time for europe to turn the tables on bullying britain ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/11/europe-turn-tables-bullying-britain-david-cameron-eu ) read that article when it came out . 
  it was fun . 
  the saltiness was palpable . 
  a nice little anglophobic fantasy for eu federalists to drool over . 
  that 's all they 'll be able to do , mind you . 
  this . 
  there 's a misconception that british euroscepticism reflects a hatred of other european countries . 
  it is n't hatred , it 's indifference . 
  most british people do n't know or care about the politics of other eu countries , even those people who are relatively well informed about domestic politics . 
  you only need to look at our news ; you get far more stuff about the us presidential primaries than you do about european politics . 
  that 's just how it goes . 
  the pro-eu side is happy to ramp up the fear to try and win the referendum . 
  so they ca n't complain when the anti-eu side does the same . 
  if they want to raise the spectre of economic ruin , we can raise the spectre of barbarian hordes swarming from calais . 
  god , i cringe when people say `` eussr '' unironically . 
  i 'm in favour of leaving the eu , but people who use that term make us all look like a bunch of loons . 
  i would n't describe the english example as traditional dress , it 's more period costume . 
  nobody would wear that outside of some sort of historical reenactment or during filming for a period drama . 
  the irish example is clearly scottish , too . 
  i was comparing it more to refugees from earlier conflicts . 
  take the bosnian refugees as an example . 
  germany gave them temporary protection , but immediately returned them once hostilities had ceased . 
  they were adequately protected from danger , but it never led to them being given the right to live permanently in a first world country . 
  it seems that at some point refugee status has moved away from saving people 's lives and catering for their needs ( something which turkey undoubtedly does ) to being about giving people jobs and a western lifestyle . 
  they should be housed in refugee camps ( whether in turkey or somewhere else ) until they can be returned home safely . 
  so , from the link , it seems like it 's just another attempt at forcing binding resettlement quotas down the throats of unwilling countries . 
  these people can go to hell . 
  ** conservatives , aka tories : ** the governing party which david cameron belongs to . 
  has a parliamentary majority . 
  centre-right and pro-business , traditionally associated with the more affluent middle classes . 
  very deeply divided on the european union , with cameron and most of the hierarchy favouring eu membership and most of the backbenchers and party membership favouring withdrawal . 
  ** labour : ** the main opposition party . 
  centre-left , with some far left elements . 
  traditionally associated with the working classes and funded by trade unions . 
  currently there are ideological tensions within the party , with the leader jeremy corbyn and most of the membership being solidly socialist , but most mps being considerably more to the centre . 
  mostly pro-eu , but has some anti-eu elements , mainly on the far left of the party . 
  ** liberal democrats : ** centrist party . 
  previously have been seen as possible kingmakers in coalition governments , but were hit hard in last year 's election , losing the vast majority of their mps . 
  the most pro-eu party of them all , but their current position leaves them with very little influence . 
  ** united kingdom independence party : ** right wing , anti-eu . 
  has only one mp in the uk parliament ( mainly due to our winner takes all electoral system ) , but is the largest uk party in the european parliament . 
  its leader nigel farage is the most prominent voice arguing in favour of british withdrawal from the eu . 
  ** scottish national party : ** largest party in scotland . 
  has the vast majority of scottish seats in the uk parliament ( again , due to our winner takes all system ) . 
  favours independence for scotland . 
  secured an independence referendum in 2014 , which it lost , but became a stronger party as a result .
