  i asked myself `` what the hell do these people think that they 're achieving ? '', 
   i am not a soldier . 
  i am not a policeman . 
  if necessary , i 'll take up arms to fight for our civilisation , but in the meantime , i fight for it with my best weapon , namely wit . 
  thanks , that 's one of the most ridiculous things i 've ever read . 
  talk about having an incredible sense of self-importance . 
   is this not resistence ? 
  nope . 
  you honestly think that your self-perceived wit is a form of resistance ? 
  do you think that these terrorists will see it as anything but weakness ? 
  nah , we 're ok , thanks . 
  i do n't want the eu having unfettered access to british intelligence . 
  i would n't trust the eu with a burned out match , let alone state secrets . 
  i thought that the whole thing about hershey 's tasting like vomit was a myth . 
  then i tried it . 
  never again . 
  til . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  it 's probably my bias speaking , but i love our own [ union flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_united_kingdom.svg ) . 
  it 's incredibly distinctive and iconic , which is probably why it 's used so often as a fashion accessory . 
  other than the union flag , i am quite partial to the flags of [ albania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_albania.svg ) and [ turkey . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_turkey.svg ) simple , yet distinctive . 
  even though i 'm not too keen on tricolour flags ( i find them all a bit samey ) , i do quite like the flags of [ estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_estonia.svg ) and [ lithuania , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_lithuania.svg ) they 're quite striking and distinctive . 
  the flag i hate the most is that of [ catalonia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_catalonia.svg ) i find it to be gaudy and utterly putrid . 
  the [ catalan nationalist flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:estelada_blava.svg ) is even worse and looks like something from an african military dictatorship . 
  i 'm not overly keen on the flag of [ bosnia and herzegovina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina.svg ) either . 
  or jaundice . 
  that yellow , eugh . 
   scotland : ya , really ? 
  i 've never heard anybody say that in southern scotland . 
  it 's utter bollocks . 
  i 'm originally from motherwell and i 've never heard anybody say ya , either in motherwell or anywhere else in scotland . 
  as you said , it 's either `` yes '' or `` aye '' . 
  i do n't know where the hell they got `` ya '' from . 
  in fact , the entire map of the british isles is a load of crap . 
  fewer than a fifth of the welsh actually speak welsh . 
  more people in ireland speak polish than irish . 
  cornish is spoken by a few bearded retired geography teachers , probably only as a more authentically cornish alternative to practicing morris dancing . 
  wherever you go in the uk or ireland , people will almost certainly just say `` yes '' . 
   shit . 
  you ca n't call out donald trump for being crazy without getting downvoted in this sub anymore ? 
  i do n't think the downvoting was down to opinions about trump , it was more because it was a rather pathetic * ad hominem * attack , complaining about americans commenting on european news and attempting to divert the conversation into us politics . 
  this is a story about swedish immigration policy , i see no need to bring trump into it . 
  you were probably getting mixed up with yugoslavia . 
  that was the one that had a bloody dissolution in the 1990s . 
  what are `` european interests '' ? 
  if there 's anything that this crisis has taught us it 's that such a concept does n't exist . 
  there are 28 different countries , each with their own interests . 
  that 's only a problem when you have people like merkel who think that they have the right to force the rest of europe to deal with her country 's problems . 
  if germany wishes to embrace the willkommenskultur , then they have absolutely every right to do so . 
  but germany needs to be willing to accept all these migrants without complaint . 
  every last one of them . 
  france will have some way to go if they want to beat japan for the position of best non-scottish whisky producer . 
  excellent news , i hope that british weapons manufacturers can take full advantage of this . 
   now if they could bring this up on an eu wide level . 
  no , let 's not . 
  i do n't want officials in brussels to have any more of a veto over my country 's foreign policy than their counterparts in moscow or beijing . 
   the un believed that as its founding member and prime moral backing , you would uphold the deal you gave to the world after ww2 . 
  what deal ? 
  the british people were certainly never consulted on any deal . 
  we do n't owe anybody a damn thing after world war 2 . 
  we have no responsibilities to uphold . 
  if germany wants to wallow in guilt then that 's up to them , but we have nothing to feel guilty about . 
  the brexit debate is getting more fun by the day . 
  there reason why it 's so expensive in the uk is because the country is run by successive waves of idiots who have neglected the country 's energy infrastructure . 
  the previous labour government has to shoulder much of the blame for this . 
  they did n't want to make any difficult decisions , especially regarding nuclear power , so they kicked the can further down the road . 
  if only they had invested in a decent state-owned nuclear power program while state finances were good ( labour were in power for the whole pre-crash period ) , we could enjoy nice cheap and clean electricity like the french . 
  i was referring more to british wars of aggression . 
  our wars of aggression have largely been reserved for non-europeans since the medieval era . 
  i 'm not keen on it . 
  i would n't say that i hate it because hate is too strong an emotion . 
  the eu as an institution has n't done anything so awful that would give me cause to feel outright hatred for it . 
  i see it more as a pain in the arse than anything else . 
  i 'd be a lot happier if it was just a free trade area . 
  that said , i do n't object to other european countries pursuing political integration if that what they really want . 
  i just do n't think it 's for us . 
  do n't worry , we have n't been murderously hostile to europeans since medieval times . 
  i mean , we 've been murderously hostile to plenty of other people , but not europeans . 
   so if you leave , more and more idiots can really force leaving more countries from eu . 
  no countries can be forced into leaving the eu . 
  if the uk left the eu then it would be entirely the choice of other member states if they decided to follow our lead . 
   i 've listened to people like nigel farage on youtube , and people like him honestly think the uk is going to go back to being a huge power , with tons of influence on former colonial territories , driving leyland cars and telling mercedes and bmw to shove it , drinking earl gray and bovril with a nice smile on the face of every proud british man , women and child . 
  if you think that the argument against the eu in any way resembled the straw man that you 've constructed then you clearly have n't been listening . 
   german was almost as predominant as english before ww1 . 
  not from any source that i 've ever seen . 
  [ from here , ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/zwiebelfisch/onionfish-german-as-the-official-language-of-the-usa-a-306711.html ) for example , it says that german speakers never exceeded a third in pennsylvania . 
  i 'm aware of the campaign to eradicate the german language in the usa during the first world war , but it still was n't anywhere near as widespread as english . 
  as for that map of ancestry , it does n't say what language is spoken . 
  just because somebody is of a particular ancestry , it does n't mean that they speak that language . 
  especially not in a country like the usa which has seen successive waves of immigrants . 
   you should disregard sentimentality and using logic just try to imagine what would be the best for you and your children 's future . 
  would it be a united europe or a bunch of fragmented states that segregate themselves into nationalities . 
  oh , i 'm not being sentimental at all . 
  i 'm one of the least sentimental people around . 
  it 's my concern for my children 's future that is behind my lack of desire to see the uk as part of a federal europe . 
  i simply would n't trust a federal european government . 
  i trust the eu officials in brussels even less than i trust my own government ( and i ** really ** do n't trust them ) . 
  i feel that they would see us as a cow just waiting to be milked at every opportunity .
