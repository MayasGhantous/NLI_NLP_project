  same as if you made your prediction based on online discourse . 
  but it did n't work out that way . 
  it was the silent majority that decided the outcome . 
  you do n't win an election ( or a referendum ) by putting up the most signs and bumper stickers . 
  a vote from the most enthusiastic , passionate and politically engaged person is completely cancelled out by a vote from someone who rarely even thinks about politics . 
  and there 's many more of the latter than the former . 
  obviously the situation in the usa over a hundred years ago is very different to the situation in modern europe , or even the modern usa . 
  you had large amounts of land that you wanted to settle . 
  besides , any country can still choose to admit immigrants without granting automatic birthright citizenship . 
  you can grant citizenship later to those who you want to . 
  operating a policy of * jus soli * lowers your control over who can settle and encourages the `` anchor baby '' phenomenon . 
  hey , it 's only right that our esteemed mps should be subject to the same levels of surveillance as the great unwashed . 
  depends on what you mean by great . 
  i would n't see an `` anchor baby '' situation where illegal immigrants can sneak into the country and stay there because they manage to give birth as a great thing . 
  i doubt that many people in my country or across europe would , either . 
  [ the irish certainly did n't . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3801839.stm ), 
  it 's not pure * jus soli * ( an incredibly stupid policy ) as it will only apply to families where one parent has a long term residence permit , but it 's still a step in the wrong direction . 
  it undermines citizenship laws across the eu . 
  subsidiarity has always struck me as an example of newspeak . 
  `` let 's improve local decision making by centralising more power from national governments !, 
  if anything it could result in the opposite , as in scotland . 
   he wo n't either be learning english , i think he 'll be able to communicate adequately given his circumstances . 
   nor create uk wealth by consuming human goods and working he 'll be creating wealth by attracting more visitors to the zoo . 
  everybody loves polar bears . 
   or making human babies that will , in the next generation , be an integral part of british society ... 
  i 'm sure his descendants will integrate into british society and become a valued part of the british polar bear community . 
  and they 're so cute . 
   besides , i would see the polar bear fitter ... at the north pole ( ! ), 
  than in a country zoo in the middle of britain . 
  all his needs will be catered for . 
  he wo n't starve as many polar bears do . 
  at least the polar bear wo n't be claiming welfare benefits or demand government housing assistance ( his accommodation is already sorted ) . 
  so there 's that . 
  least of all me . 
  it was absolute drivel , but what i think about it is irrelevant . 
  the people who made this video clearly are n't going to care about the opinions of people who have already made their minds up . 
  it 's geared towards apathetic and uninformed people , and those are the people who will decide the outcome of any referendum . 
  hollande 's opinions are about as important as those of a drunken vagrant urinating in the street . 
  he 'll just be a good little boy and do whatever mama merkel says . 
  i know what you mean . 
  i 've been using the internet from its relatively early days , when there was n't quite as huge a level of information as there is now . 
  i have a little brother ( big age gap between us ) and i 'm amazed by the knowledge he has about some things . 
  he knows things that i would never have known at his age and when he 's asked how he knows them , the answer is always the same . 
  `` internet '' . 
  then do n't be surprised if people ignore that kind of cheap rhetorical trick . 
  if people are have legitimate concerns about immigration or question our membership of the eu , they 're not going to be convinced by pleas of `` but what about all the nasty corporations ? 
  there 's no need to conflate two separate issues . 
  the view ( that i share ) that corporations get away with too much does n't have any bearing on the immigration situation . 
  you 're just engaging in whataboutery . 
  there 's no finer way of deradicalising a jihadist than dropping a bomb on their head or putting a bullet in them . 
  you can guarantee that their activities will immediately cease . 
  what the fuck were they doing giving the aid in the first place ? 
  british citizens should be banned from providing assistance to the camps in calais , they 're helping to undermine the country 's borders . 
  i think that sounds about right . 
  there 's no real appetite in uk politics for us to take a leading role in the eu . 
  even pro-eu politicians tend not to argue that . 
  we tend to want to maintain our own sovereignty and let other eu countries get on with doing whatever they want . 
  it seems that the uk and france are very much alike . 
  i was looking at the population of the city proper . 
  though in hindsight i should probably have considered the metropolitan areas , too . 
  post amended . 
   now , consider this map of the uk and this list of the largest uk urban areas . 
  note how , other than london , only three ( bristol , southampton , and portsmouth ) are below the severn wash line . 
  greater london is gigantic , relatively speaking , compared to its us counterparts -- 13 % of the entire country 's population ( ! ), 
  -- and has no national peers the way la and chicago are real rivals to nyc . 
  i would argue that the usa ( owing to unique historical and economic factors ) is not a useful comparison point for the uk . 
  european countries of a similar size ( along with a few outlying places like japan and south korea ) would be more useful , and most of them are characterised by a capital city that is dominant both economically and population wise ( germany is very much the exception rather than the rule ) . 
  admittedly london is certainly more dominant than most capital cities , but that is owed more to its huge size . 
  london is by far the largest city in the eu so it 's only natural that such a place will predominate . 
   this causes a huge imbalance , wherein london 1 ) sucks up most of the capital and human energy that would otherwise supply cities south of the severn wash , and 2 ) sucks up much of the capital and human energy that would otherwise supply the country north of the severn wash. . that rests on the huge assumption that london is gaining at the expense of the rest of the uk and that the rest of the uk would automatically benefit if london was cut down to size . 
  such an assumption rests on the idea that there is some sort of natural economic equilibrium in the world that is currently being skewed . 
  guess what , there is n't , economic activity has always clustered in a relatively small handful of areas . 
  regional wealth is n't a zero-sum game . 
  capital investment and human energy can just as easily move to other countries these days as it can move within a country . 
  do n't assume that by economically hobbling london you 'd benefit the rest of the uk , you might just find that the rest of the uk remains unchanged , but london becomes an economically depressed wasteland . 
  that would be bad even for the rest of the uk as these areas wo n't have the same levels of fiscal transfers that are disproportionately gained from london taxes to pay for public services . 
  london has been the dominant settlement in the british isles since the romans built it two thousand years ago . 
  that 's not going to change . 
  yes , there needs to be more of a focus on improving regional economies , trying to achieve it by sabotaging the country 's largest and most successful city would be folly and would backfire .

  human rights should n't be top priority for the foreign office , or even a low priority . 
  it 's not our job to police the world and we should n't be playing `` white man 's burden '' with other countries . 
  foreign policy should be based purely around the uk 's economic interests . 
  besides , human rights are completely subjective anyway . 
  it will take more than an insistence on deportation to deter them . 
  you have to make the conditions they face in europe utterly dreadful . 
  make sure they ca n't get any decent work . 
  make sure they ca n't legally rent or own property and end up homeless . 
  deny them access to healthcare , education or any other public services . 
  or make it less attractive to enter europe . 
  push factors are complimentary with pull factors . 
  if you make it impossible for them to live a humane life in europe ( by clamping down on employment rights , access to healthcare , education , etc. ), 
  and ensure that they end up living in equally squalid ( or worse ) conditions when they get here , it will be unattractive for them to move here . 
  besides , if we were to count overseas territories , argentina would definitely win for least favourite neighbour . 
  i just wish our idiot government would stay out of this . 
  it 's none of our business . 
   let 's stop acting like limp wristed guilt ridden liberals just for a second . 
  i 'm not liberal , not by any definition . 
  neither an i guilt ridden , i could n't give a toss about the empire .
