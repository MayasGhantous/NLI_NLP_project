  we do n't have the same responsibilities to foreign nationals as we have to our own citizens so i think that our asylum systems should reflect that . 
  this is why european countries need to review the laws and international conventions surrounding the refugee and asylum systems . 
  it 's ridiculous that any country should have a legal duty to protect absolutely everyone , including foreign criminals or islamist radicals . 
  hey , maybe cameron 's got a good sense of humour after all . 
  putting saudi arabia in the human rights council is very , very funny and only adds to the absurdity surrounding the un . 
  good times . 
  just fyi , no eu country grants automatic birthright citizenship . 
  the last eu country to abolish it [ was your own by referendum ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3801839.stm ) in 2004 . 
  you do grant it to kids who are born to foreign resident parents who have been living in ireland legally for a certain period of time , but you would n't grant automatic citizenship to a child born to illegal immigrants . 
  [ see section 6 of your amended nationality and citizenship act . 
  ] ( http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/inis/consolidationinca.pdf/files/consolidationinca.pdf ), 
  all the more reason to keep them out of your country . 
  there 's nothing to be gained by importing people with behavioural problems . 
  it 's better to keep the quarrels out of your society , far fewer headaches that way . 
  no point in causing yourself easily avoidable problems . 
   or smarter . 
  if spain had granted the referendum 2 or 3 years ago i assure you there 's no way independentism would win and the matter would be settled for years . 
  i doubt it . 
  granting a referendum has n't settled the scottish independence question . 
  far from it , in fact . 
  before the referendum , pro-union parties dominated scottish seats in the uk parliament . 
  after the referendum , the pro-independence snp now have nearly all seats in the uk parliament as well as a majority in the devolved scottish parliament . 
  from a unionist perspective , the referendum backfired , even if scotland ended up voting against independence . 
   the uk has played it smart giving wales , scotland and northern ireland their own local assemblies which helps satisfies local desires for autonomy but keeps some powers centralised . 
  then it backfired spectacularly in the case of scotland . 
  labour devolved power to scotland in the expectation that the scottish parliament would be their own little fiefdom . 
  scottish labour politician [ george robertson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_robertson,_baron_robertson_of_port_ellen ) famously predicted that `` devolution will kill nationalism stone dead '' , but clearly the opposite has happened . 
  instead of satisfying demands for autonomy , devolution has instead inflamed the situation and has resulted in the snp dominating scottish politics both in westminster and holyrood , something that is completely unprecedented . 
  oh yes , i 'm familiar with his sort . 
  you definitely should n't listen to the more strident independence supporters . 
  in the run up to the referendum , the likes of him would n't even address the prospect of defeat , even in spite of the fact that almost every poll pointed to a no vote . 
  they could n't imagine how anybody could even think of voting no . 
  then when the result came in , some of them even said the result was rigged . 
  it was laughable . 
   they 're more likely to win by trying to change people 's minds and waiting until the tories fuck brexit up on their own than by desperately hanging onto a few more constituencies . 
  no they 're not . 
  labour has very little credibility left . 
  no leave voter is going to listen to them try and convince them that it 's a great idea to prevent brexit . 
  if anything , it will poison things even more . 
   labour 's chances of actually winning a majority in the foreseeable future were crushed by snp in 2015 anyway . 
  that 's something of a myth . 
  in both 1997 and 2001 , labour had a majority even without scottish seats , and in 2005 they would have had enough for an effective majority . 
  labour could win again , but they 'll have to win over english voters . 
  in particular , english brexit voters . 
   this is the time when they can afford to trade a few seats in order to offer a long term vision and an opportunity to revert a decision that will inevitably end up being a massive fuck up . 
  labour ca n't afford to lose anything right now . 
  given that shambolic state that it 's in , people are increasingly losing their patience with the party . 
  if they 're seen to be trying to block the will of the people , the result from brexit voters will be one of fury . 
  it will be the final nail in the coffin for labour as an effective political force . 
  clegg knows exactly what the eu is all about . 
  if you want to sell the eu to the british people , you have to hide its true nature . 
  you have to try and hide its ambitions for military integration and greater politicial integration . 
  the remain campaign understood this , and they nearly pulled it off . 
  if pro-eu politicians were honest , the margin for leave would probably have been more like 60 % . 
  not a bad idea . 
  when you 're paying their wages , it means that you have a massive amnount of leverage over them . 
   i 'm not sure i quite understand why labour is intent on pursuing brexit . 
  [ because most labour constituencies probably voted leave . 
  ] ( https://medium.com/@chrishanretty/most-labour-mps-represent-a-constituency-that-voted-leave-36f13210f5c6 ) it 's really as simple as that . 
  if labour are to have any hope of ever forming a government again , they need the support of at least some leave voters . 
  good luck doing that if you try and prevent brexit . 
  even if corbyn makes it a whip vote , labour wo n't be completely united . 
  corbyn ca n't control the party , and there were pro-leave labour mps even before the referendum , such as gisela stuart and kate hoey . 
  on top of that , you 'll have plenty of labour mps who are feeling the pressure after their constituencies voted leave . 
  some of them will turn . 
  even with all the lib dems ( all eight of them ) , the snp , the majority of the labour party and a handful of tory rebels , it wo n't be enough . 
  the tories will have nearly all of their party , some labour rebels and the dup . 
  that should be enough . 
  # \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 thank you daddy \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064, 
  this is one of the great things about daddy being elected us prez . 
  given that the us is highly unlikely to care about human rights in other countries , it will be untenable for the eu to care much . 
  time for the west to take a step back and leave the rest of the world to sort their own problems . 
  maybe effervescent brexit , fragrant brexit or ambrosial brexit . 
  to be fair , it is so much more entertaining . 
  i 've been taking more notice of this than i did of my own country 's election last year .

  `` england gets its first commercial wave power generator thanks to funding from uk taxpayers '' . 
  we 're one of the main net contributors to the eu budget . 
  we 're getting nothing from them that was n't ours in the first place . 
   so you 're ok with people possibly dying in terrorist attacks because the spy 's are n't allowed to talk with each other because of separation of ways ? 
  if intelligence cooperation breaks down due to brexit , that will be a result of the eu taking a hostile negotiating stance . 
  that is why it 's very important for the eu to reach a good agreement with the uk . 
   is this what that vote was about ? 
  defiant selfishness and mortal hatred of all things europe ? 
  is this supposed to be the new national identity of the uk as a people ? 
  we voted to leave the eu because of the arrogant a contemptuous manner it behaves towards us . 
  you only have to think back to cameron 's renegotiation attempts where the eu treated it all as a tedious little sideshow . 
  had the eu behaved with a little more flexibility , we might not be in the situation we find ourselves now . 
  hopefully the eu will learn from its mistakes and seek to maintain good relations with the uk . 
  it is in all our interests to see trade and intelligence cooperation remain as smooth as possible . 
  we 're not the ones who are engaging in spite . 
  there have been plenty of eu politicians who want to make us pay and make us poorer for leaving the bloc . 
  under such circumstances , we do n't have much of a choice but to use whatever leverage we have . 
  we ca n't afford not to . 
  intelligence is an asset like any other . 
  if we 're going to grant people access to our intelligence ( especially given that out intelligence services are some of the most capable in the world ) , i do n't think that it 's unreasonable to ask for cooperation in other areas . 
  this is why it will be in the interests of all parties to come to an agreement which maintains simple , tariff-free trade between the uk and the eu . 
  obama does seem to lack self-awareness when it comes to how much he thinks the whole world loves him .
