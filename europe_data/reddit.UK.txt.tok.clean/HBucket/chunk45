  i wonder if they 're going to promise pet unicorns for everyone , too . 
  i absolutely agree . 
  the esa is an example of european cooperation at its best . 
  it 's for the benefit of us all if it continues , regardless of our eu status . 
  sure , i do n't necessarily disagree with the decision ( i have n't really read up the specifics of the case so i wo n't be making any judgements ) . 
  it 's just that for many people , the verdicts of the echr do n't necessarily mean anything to them . 
  they have their own opinions and they wo n't necessarily defer to a foreign court . 
   why is it still `` violated '' in quotation marks when there 's a ruling by the echr ? 
  because many people wo n't consider this a violation of human rights , regardless of how the echr might rule . 
  been on the sauce tonight ? 
  agreed . 
  i 'm no fan of verhofstadt , but that seems like a perfectly reasonable timetable . 
  and right on cue we have the bitter remainers who want to act like this is some sort of political act brought on by the referendum . 
  you people would blame brexit if you stubbed your tow while getting out of bed . 
  i doubt the thicko who attacked that woman even voted . 
  there 's a solution to the dominance of us social media giants : build alternative , european social media platforms that are good enough to attract users away from facebook . 
  naturally , that wo n't happen as most of the eu is utterly hopeless when it comes to tech startups . 
  there is an alternative and that would be for governments to ban facebook from operating in their countries , instructing all isps to block it and banning their citizens from using it . 
  of course that wo n't happen as it would be quite an outrageous violation of the freedom of citizens . 
  so we 'll all see more of the same . 
  we 'll see europeans bitching about facebook 's policies while continuing to use it . 
  we 'll see european governments and the eu complaining about the unfair dominance of the likes of facebook while their citizens carry on ignoring them . 
  joining facebook is like joining a private club . 
  the owners are free to say what you can or ca n't post on their servers . 
  if you 're using an american website then you have to expect that it will be run according to american cultural norms . 
  do n't like it ? 
  you know what to do . 
   but how does one define an extremist . 
  that is for society to decide . 
  as every society does . 
   and do you intent to remove non-nationals of the rights that prevent them from being tortured or executed ? 
  all i 'm saying is that whether or not a foreign national is tortured or executed in their home country should not be a concern of our legal system . 
   no but they 're a damn sight better than having none at all . 
  debatable . 
  given the track record of many countries with constitutions , i would n't place any faith in it . 
  one could even argue that it leads to complacency . 
   that is complacent . 
  to assume that it ca n't happen because most nations have a worse record is ridiculous . 
  unless you think nations like saudi arabia , zimbabwe and north korea are those we should be comparing ourselves to ? 
  even comparing the uk to the rest of europe , i think that we come out pretty well . 
  during times when the rest of europe was in political turmoil , with periods under absolutist monarchs , bloody revolutions and/or dictatorships , we muddled along with an imperfect , yet evolving political system that was able to make incremental changes as we made the transition to a modern , industrial society . 
  it might not have been an ideal system , but i think it has served us quite well . 
   and which rights would those be that change so easily ? 
  is the right to life one of those ? 
  are you thinking of the right to a fair trial ? 
  personally , those are rights that i would n't change . 
   it is all well and good to claim that human rights ought to change and adapt , i 'm not saying that human rights ** should ** change and adapt , i 'm saying that they ** do ** change and adapt . 
  the definition of what constitutes a fundamental human right has changed considerably over the years . 
  that is as factual as saying that the earth is round . 
  what i 'm saying is that i support a political system that recognises this very obvious fact and can respond accordingly . 
  i disagree with the idea that we should treat human rights as if they 're irrefutable laws carved into stone tablets by god himself . 
   but what articles are problematic ? 
  for me , it 's the laws that prevent us from deporting foreign extremists due to concerns about their treatment in their home countries . 
  personally , i think that the laws should absolve our society of all responsibility towards them . 
  i believe that the majority of the population would agree with me . 
   and what threat that we see today has n't been seen before ? 
  terrorism is more certainly not such a case , as it has been around for much of the 20th century , and was far worse a few decades ago in europe than it is now . 
  i 'm not reacting out of some fear of terrorism , i realise that my chances of being killed in a terrorist attack are negligible to the point of utter irrelevance . 
  there are my political beliefs and they would be exactly the same if terrorism was not a problem right now . 
   if you allow such flexibility , you inevitably get populist moves to change laws to target certain people or even groups , with the effect of depriving more and more people of their rights and making their lives less secure and safe . 
  you 're acting like constitutions are like some sort of magic bullet that prevents oppression . 
  weimar germany had a democratic constitution that protected fundamental rights , but that did n't stop hitler . 
  meanwhile , the uk has never had a codified constitution , yet we have a much better track record on democratic governance the vast majority of the world . 
  i disagree , as fundamental human rights are an inherently subjective thing . 
  the definition changes over time . 
  i think it 's a good thing to have a flexible political system that can quickly adapt to such changes . 
  there are those of us who see this flexibility as one of the strengths of the uk political system . 
   why join the european union in the first place if you are against the basic principle of democracy ? 
  you 'll have to ask older people the question of why we joined , because that was a long time before i was even born . 
  unforunately , the british people were never consulted on whether or not they wanted to join , they were taken in without a vote . 
  inside the eu we simply have to swallow . 
  we get outvoted a lot and that will only continue . 
  our voice in the eu is only a tiny and ignored one . 
  we will have more power to resist eu impositions from the outside than we could ever have inside . 
  the next step , of course , is that we have to define `` worthy '' . 
  my definition of the term will differ quite starkly from that of an eu federalist . 
  it 's not so much a question of whether the eu is capable of `` reform '' ( a meaningless term given how ambiguous it is ) , but whether or not we like the direction is it taking . 
  i 've never liked the direction the eu is taking . 
  the people in brussels seem to think that every problem that europe faces can only be solved by granting more powers to the eu . 
  i think that the eu has far too much power already . 
  i think it has a bloated budget and far too many competencies . 
  yet the eu keeps grabbing more and more powers . 
  that 's why i want out . 
  yes , we would have a vote in a federal eu but it sounds an awful lot to me like two wolves and sheep voting on what to have for dinner . 
  the big problem for me was that i have never been satisfied that our interests could be protected inside the eu . 
  you might argue that being outside of the eu puts us at the mercy of power blocs such as the us or china , but i would argue that being inside the eu puts us at the mercy of other eu member states . 
  this is especially the case after the libson treaty and the introduction of qualified majority voting , a situation which can result in us being outvoted and powerless to resist impositions on us . 
  staying in the eu means that other eu member states would have much more power over us than either the us or china could ever hope to have . 
  i have no more desire for my country to take orders from brussels than i do for it to take orders from washington or beijing . 
  i agree , and that is exactly why i was never convinced by the people who insisted that brexit would lead to the break up of the uk . 
  the eu is a threat to larger regional states such as the uk and spain as it makes independence a much less drastic step . 
  the more powers the eu gains ( as it constantly has been gaining , piece by piece ) , the easier it will become for regions to secede . 
  that makes the eu a very dangerous thing if you 're a brit or a spaniard who wishes to maintain the territorial integrity of their state . 
  i just think that the eu could have shown a little more flexibility in cameron 's negotiations , given how much we contribute to the eu . 
  sure , opening a jar is completely , 100 % analogous to a freedom of movement treaty between states . 
  whether or not you think we have full control of our borders , the practical effect is the same . 
  you 're only engaging in semantics . 
  no , we ** had ** full control of our borders . 
  when we joined the precursor to the eu we gave away control . 
  now hopefully we 'll be getting it back .
