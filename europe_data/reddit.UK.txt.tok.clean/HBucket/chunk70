  i thought that we would probably vote to remain in the eu , but i also thought that there 's was a realistic possibility of us voting to leave . 
  the polling situation is completely different . 
  should have clarified it to say anyone in the uk . 
  because given that it 's in our exclusive economic zone , it wo n't be anybody else 's decision . 
  i could n't find any polls where the liberals were 15 points behind . 
  two months from the vote , there were two polls where they were 10 and 11 points behind , but those were outliers . 
  most polls two months out only showed a narrow gap . 
  haha , i would n't be surprised if you got better returns from a savings account than the bookies , even with the interest rates being as low as they are . 
  did they ? 
  [ a quick look tells me that the canadian polls were reasonably close , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_in_the_canadian_federal_election,_2015 ) with the liberals racking up healthy leads later on . 
  those polls do n't point towards a major upset , certainly not to the level of a party coming back from 20 points behind . 
  sure , some people thought that the eu referendum was a foregone conclusion . 
  those people were idiots . 
  [ plenty of polls showed a lead for leave , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum#2016 ) so nobody could say those polls pointed to a foregone conclusion . 
  but labour is 20 points behind . 
  that 's an enormous difference . 
  no it was n't . 
  people like to repeat that ad nauseum , [ but plenty of polls showed a lead for the leave side . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum#2016 ) anybody who looked at those polls and said it was a foregone conclusion is an idiot . 
  but labour is 20 points behind the tories . 
  they have no chance . 
  ah , interesting . 
  i 'll file that one away for later . 
   they thought the same of the brexit referendum . 
  only idiots thought that . 
  the polls were very close in the brexit vote , with plenty of them showing a lead for the leave side . 
  there was always a realistic chance of us voting to leave the eu . 
  but the tories are about 20 points ahead of labour . 
  with our electoral system , expect a landslide . 
  firstly , it was n't yes vs no , it was remain vs leave . 
  secondly , [ you could n't be more wrong . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum#2016 ) plenty of polls showed leave in the lead . 
  only idiots thought that it was a foregone conclusion . 
  if labour end up being too scared to hold an early election , they 'll look like an even more pathetic joke than they do now . 
  we can all come out with bizarre possible scenarios until the cows come home , but there is n't any realistic outcome other than a big tory win . 
  both brexit and trump had realistic chances of winning . 
  the polls were always close , people just convinced themselves that nobody could possibly vote against what they considered the sensible option . 
  corbyn 's labour is about 20 points behind . 
  parties do n't win from that far behind . 
  also , corbyn is incapable of running a populist campaign . 
  he 's a joke . 
   i understood it as fishing being pictured as a mutual affair even in death . 
  it might well be a mutual affair , but the benefits of it have always been one way . 
  i do n't think that argument will convince anyone . 
  if the european fisheries alliance think they can convince anyone with such a feeble argument , they 're in for a rude awakening . 
   i 'm not saying it 's likely . 
  what i am saying is that it is a move that involves risk . 
  only in an abstract , theoretical sense . 
  in a practical , real life sense , it 's not a gamble at all . 
  parties do n't come back from trailing in the polls by 20 % in two months . 
  it just does n't happen . 
  i wo n't be surprised if the lib dems pick up a few seats , though they 'll still be way down from their pre-2015 level . 
  but it wo n't be enough to challenge the massively increased majority that the tories will get . 
  there 's a lengthy leadership contest . 
  given that labour is still badly divided , expect a very bitter one . 
  then there will be the challenge of putting together a manifesto and convincing the people that they 're a credible government after corbyn 's pathetic display . 
  all in two months . 
  no chance . 
  even if corbyn resigns , labour ca n't win a june election . 
  it 's too late for them . 
  if they get their act together , they could be contenders five years down the line . 
  but that 's a big if, 
   is the nsh really that destroyed compare to a few years ago ? 
  the nhs has problems , but that has always been the case for as long as i 've been alive . 
  longer than that , i imagine . 
  do n't believe everything you read on the internet . 
  unlike with the eu referendum , this is n't a political gamble . 
  the outcome is a foregone conclusion . 
  it 's not just the italian newspapers that have been at it . 
  plenty of newspapers and websites have been happy to spread the idea of widespread regret about brexit , despite there being absolutely no evidence for it . 
  the most glaring example was the proposed [ services directive , ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4698524.stm ) spearheaded by dutch eu commissioner frits bolkestein . 
  it would have allowed for service providers to operate freely scross the eu . 
  instead all we got was avery heavily watered down version due to opposition from , among other countries , germany . 
  germany only likes the single market when it suits them . 
  [ vince cable certainly seems to agree . 
  ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/10/germany-and-france-bend-single-market-rules-so-why-cant-britain-control ), 
  it 's also good to bear in mind that the tories are notoriously unsentimental when it comes to ditching leaders that have ceased to be useful . 
  they 're driven primary by a hunger for power , and they certainly would n't let an old backseat driver get in the way . 
  i think `` despise '' would be a bit too strong a word . 
  for me , it 's more of a feeling that a parting of ways would be best for both parties . 
  off the top of my head : * common agricultural policy . 
  encourages inefficiency and drives up food prices , all to protect the vested interests of small farmers in countries like france . 
  the uk made numberous attempts to reform this and got absolutely nowhere . 
  * the single market . 
  this has always been a sham designed to bolster the industries of some countries more than others . 
  it has covered food and manufactured goods perfectly well . 
  services , which the uk excels in , not so much . 
  the uk has often tried to extend the single market to services , again to no avail . 
  even the supposedly less protectionist germans did n't like the idea as they wanted to protect their own uncompetetive service providers . 
  * contributions . 
  we have consistently been the second largest net contributor to the eu , yet our influence does n't reflect that . 
  even when tony blair surrendered a big chunk of our rebate in 2005 , we got absolutely nothing back for it . 
  our contributions have always been far too high , given what a state our country is in . 
  * freedom of movement . 
  benefits some countries more than others . 
  the flow of people has placed enormous strain on a relatively small handful of countries . 
  * military ambitions . 
  the eu has been pushing for military integration . 
  i would argue that it is more down to political ambition than military necessity . 
  * the euro .
