surprised you do n't remember that . 
  this got the same amount of media hysteria as the raoul moat spree . 
  [ well the last fatal police shooting i remember was in 2012 , so that 's a bit more recent ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/9551123/two-female-police-officers-shot-dead-in-greater-manchester.html ), 
  but it would have been pretty infeasible to hold onto just hong kong island as it is so intertwined with the rest of the territory . 
  china would also not accept the uk holding onto it . 
  we did have our own little [ guyana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_guyana ) !, 
  we just did n't hold onto it like the french !, 
  [ officially over with fife declaring for no ] ( https://twitter.com/bbcscotlandnews/status/512830629281406976 ), 
  alot of people in banking and personally from a farming perspective independence is very risky e.g. 
  ca n't sell products under the british brand . 
  thrilled with east lothian !!!, 
  no is definitely best for us !, 
  orkney 's notable celebrity is a big brother winner ... 
  lower turnout than elsewhere of 75 % in glasgow . 
  could be a big deal if that 's one of the places yes need to get most of their votes from . 
  clackmannanshire is about to declare soon . 
  bbc are saying 54 % yes . 
  i think you are mixed up on that . 
  however yes do seem disappointed as they needed a bigger win there . 
  rumored 62 % no in my home county !, 
  [ first official turnout figures ] ( https://twitter.com/bbcscotlandnews/status/512741516335267840 ), 
  voted no, 
  all stocked up for an all nighter !!!, 
  one tub of quality streets and plenty of tea . 
  just cast my ballot as a no vote . 
  hope as many of my country folk as possible take part in this great democratic process . 
  scotland is already free , thank you . 
  free to democratically decide what is best for our country whether in a strong and stable union ( as i believe is best for us and the rest of the uk ) or to go it alone separately and make our own decisions . 
  [ gordon brown 's speech for the union ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j39bbv7cbjk ) [ alex salmond 's final push ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x9spsqmfggm ),

  [ do n't worry , it 's all to do with syria ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xqvjac_naki ), 
  same, 
  if we 're talking about notoriously bad towns i 'd probably pick paisley . 
  well yes league is based around small formerly industrial towns and cities like workington , whitehaven and barrow-in-furness and the large formerly working class populations in those places . 
  you probably are right there is a larger population that supports and plays league across cumbria as a whole . 
  but when you get to the north and more rural parts of cumbria they seem to follow union ( if they follow a rugby code as carlisle is a real football town ) . 
  this is similar to much of the north of england as well with large parts of more rural yorkshire being more favourable to union . 
  that is what i 've observed when i 've been in those places . 
  well southern and coastal cumbria . 
  also even around where the catalans are , union is far bigger than league in the south of france ( except for maybe around avignon as i do n't think there are any big union teams nearby ), 
  so cumbria ( e.g. 
  whitehaven ) or north yorkshire ? 
  still when you get close to the border even in cumbria ( e.g. 
  carlisle ) league falls away in popularity . 
  i know this map wo n't be completely accurate on where the support is but the sports core base is along that motorway, 
  [ the m62 corridor from hull to st helens ] ( http://billsportsmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/rugby_super-league-xiv___.gif ) note this out of date as the celtic crusaders went bust and are now based in wrexham in the championship with widnes , who are in this corridor taking their place . 
  also salford and harlequins have been rebranded with the now london broncos being relegated at the end of the season . 
  ** scotland ** 1 ) football 2 ) = rugby union = golf football is by far and a distance the biggest sport here with our domestic league games having the third highest per capita following in europe after iceland and the faroes . 
  traditionally we had very strong teams ( both international and domestic ) for a country of our size but our quality certainly has declined recently . 
  hard to call between the next two sports as both get big turnouts for the big events and many more watching on tv . 
  outside of this there is a smaller regular spectatorship of these two sports and many people that play at their local clubs . 
  unlike in the rest of the uk there is n't much of a following for cricket though there are quite a few people that play it at local clubs during the summer . 
  sports here that are also unique or more popular here than elsewhere include shinty ( which is only really played in the highlands and islands ) , curling and lawn bowls . 
  edit : obviously andy murray is a bit of a national hero but i 'd say tennis is probably the 4th largest sport, 
  well i 've actually seen op on / r/rugbyunion before and there are a few other romanian redditors that i 've seen there as well . 
  i know it 's a long way behind football but i 've got the impression from elsewhere that its the third or fourth biggest team sport after football , handball and possibly basketball . 
  seen them in edinburgh as well . 
  pretty much the same in the uk mate ... my french knowledge consists of being able to say `` je voudrais '' in a shop before i start pointing at things i want . 
  for those that are n't aware , * some * in / r/scotland can become a little over zealous and conspiracy mongering when it comes to the media and independence . 
  the sub has a most definite political leaning so be wary . 
  britain also did have interests in greece as our intelligentsia along with the french had a romaniticised view of a new greece that was the successor to the greece of ancient times . 
  so we did help them out against the ottomans who traditionally were our allies . 
  [ britain also had control of corfu for several years during the 19th century ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_the_ionian_islands ) . 
  [ britain did also invade iran with the soviets during ww2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-soviet_invasion_of_iran ), 
  [ we actually invaded what is now argentina as well ( that 's another reason why they do n't like us ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_invasions_of_the_r%c3%ado_de_la_plata ) i think we had an tustle with germany in the 19th century over who run venezuela 's economy . 
  but a similar thing happened with the germans , units would far rather face the the americans or brits than the russians who were out for revenge . 
  also if you want to refer to the really brutal fighting in asia you should look at china . 
  far , far more people were killed and tortured there than in the pacific or elsewhere in the east with there being [ countless ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_of_nanking ) [ atrocities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unit_731 ) . 
  china just receives very little attention as it was n't a strategically decisive conflict in the fight against japan . 
  [ it was just a slow and terrible meatgrinder that held up a lot of japanese forces ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=second_sino-japanese_war&amp;action=edit&amp;section=33 ) . 
  well i would n't say that ... [ singapore ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fall_of_singapore ) , [ crete ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_crete ) and [ dunkirk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunkirk_evacuation ) depending on how you look at it . 
  [ britain was heavily involved in burma and india , a front in the war that was important but often times forgotten . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burma_campaign ) the japanese defeat at [ imphal and kohima ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_imphal ) was the biggest defeat in japanese military history up to that point . 
  [ and though it was late in the war , the ussr were decisive in ending the war against japan . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_manchuria ) some historians rate this nearly as decisive to ending the pacific war as the second atomic bombing of nagasaki as it showed the japanese leadership that the whole allied war machine was being directed at them now with the soviets destroying their most formidable fighting force in the kwantung army . 
  they did not just face a us invasion of the home islands from okinawa but a soviet invasion as well from the north . 
  [ interesting documentary on the invasion of manchuria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjygzml_x-o ), 
  those tatars are different from the crimean tatars . 
  those guys with the cones on their heads were the group i got for a eurovision sweepstakes that year . 
  [ it was n't that unpopular an idea in years gone by , with up to 10 % supporting this idea at some stages . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:nilt_nirelnd2.png ) . 
  i think that 's comparable with the number of welsh that want independence if i remember correctly, 
  most countries do n't have a requirement of a citizenship test for those born of a population that has been present in the country for a considerable length of time . 
  those that had citizenship under the previous estonian ssr ( even if this state came about by occupation and illegal means initially ) should not have been made stateless upon independence due to the language they spoke and where they or their parents came from . 
  many of these russian speakers themselves or their ancestors would have either moved to the country when it was legal to do so or may have actually been forcibly transported there by the soviet state . 
  these people did not do anything initially wrong themselves so why should they have to go through more hurdles to obtain citizenship than an estonian speaker . 
  russian is n't even a recognised regional language where the majority of the population do speak it natively . 
  these are some legitimate grievances in my view . 
  so how does a person say born in 1992 in narva that happens to be a russian-speaker who 's grandparents moved to the city in the 50 's , have anything personally to do with the soviet occupation . 
  just because the soviets treated the estonians badly does n't mean the russians should be discriminated against when they no longer have the majority of the power . 
  it is true that many of these russians were actually forcibly relocated to the baltics and it was not their choice originally to move there . 
  these people now live and work ( if they can get a job in estonia ) but are denied many rights because of the language they speak and their political beliefs . 
  also how do these russians have any control over what the russian state apologises for when they are usually not citizens of it either ? 
  so i 'm guessing by having a `` democratic '' estonia , you mean a state where all people that are born and raised in that country are given the right to citizenship and voting rights no matter what their mother tongue is ? 
  because currently i would n't say estonia acts in a very democratic way to a large number of their russian-speaking residents . 
  i think it should be appreciated that there is a good reason why some people may feel aggrieved with their situation and this is not being just another simple case of russian imperialism . 
  things do need to change in places like estonia and latvia ( just not through russian occupation ) . 
  you should really point out that those separatists were building a ** tank ** if you want it to receive more attention . 
  [ it almost looks as ridiculous as the tanks you used during ww2 ] ( http://www.storiologia.it/mondiale3/immagine63.jpg ), 
  apparently people could also vote in the poll from outside the region with it being possible for people to log in with a different name and vote over and over again . 
  people really did overhype it on / r/worldnews,
