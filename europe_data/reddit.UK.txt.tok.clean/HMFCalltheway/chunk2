  is n't this article wrong as the [ the volyn oblast ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volyn_oblast ) is in the north west of country and was formerly part of poland before the drawing of the [ curzon line ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curzon_line ) . 
  [ zakarpasttia oblast was a part of czechoslovakia before the war and i guess this is where the article is meaning to refer to ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zakarpattia_oblast ), 
  600,000 people is a larger population size than the city that i currently live in . 
  and noi did n't say gun-control does n't work it 's just that it does struggle to be effective in america due to the ease of travel across jurisdictions with different controls . 
  and oh look another right wing american article that does n't know what they are talking about citing a british tabloid that is known for exaggeration and misinformation . 
  gun crime may indeed have gone up slightly with the dm article actually many of the guns may have been replicas but [ it 's from a very low base figure .

  most burglary 's are opportunistic . 
  usually they try and rob a house if they see that no one is home and the house is unsecured . 
  situations where the occupier is in the house let alone comes in contact with the burglar are exceedingly rare . 
  i like this assumption you have , that they 'll know you 'll have a gun . 
  do you have a big neon sign outside your house telling passers-by this ? 
  if your local garda were reading this they 'd probably be interested to have a chat with you . 
  be warned . 
  well first of all chicago does have a population that is 600,000 people larger in the city itself and 3.5 million larger if you include the metro area . 
  after that there is also a higher rate of poverty level in chicago with it having a rate of 23.7 % compared to 19 % in houston . 
  so these cities may also have other factors that lead to a higher number of deaths in chicago . 
  but there is also another important thing to note . 
  with chicago it is only the city itself with strict gun control with areas in the surrounding state and in next door states being very lenient on gun control . 
  it can be very easy for straw buyers in neighboring districts to buy up guns and sell them to criminals in the city . 
  it simply is a sad fact that gun controls can be easily undermined in the us as there is no unified gun policy with ease of travel across state lines . 
  so if you compared these two cities to england and wales for example , where there are strict controls with tight prohibition of gun imports , you 'll see that these two cities combined [ had a far larger number of murders in 2012 than a population 56 million ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18900384 ) ( if your figures are just for the cities proper this is even more shocking ) . 
  [ is self-defence a genuine reason for holding a firearms license under irish law ? 
  ] ( http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/cp/ireland ) if not you may have just broken your laws by admitting this is a reason for you having a rifle . 
  you do know those areas with lower crime rates and high gun ownership that that american gun nuts cite are often more well off , less densely populated areas , like vermont , where there are fewer social issues . 
  which are probably far bigger contributing factors to the lower overall crime rate than gun ownership . 
  it is usually also the case that these areas do n't have significantly lower crime levels than comparable regions in other states and countries with them actually having still higher levels of gun crime and misuse than areas with stricter controls . 
  i actually think we have higher levels of norwegian ancestry than england not necessarily `` viking '' in general . 
  the problem with tracing distant ethnicities in england is that there were two groups ( first the angles/saxons/jutes then the danish vikings ) from roughly the same geographic region , that colonised parts of england only a few hundred years apart . 
  this makes it hard to judge whether an english person is of viking or anglo saxon descent as there were not enough distinguishable markers to tell these two ancestries apart . 
  i am glad seeing an article in a major western media outlet that is properly questioning the ukrainian side to balance the vast majority of reporting that backs the ukrainians and does make * some * very valid criticisms of the current ukrainian government ( i.e. 
  the presence of far-right extremists and the attempts to scrap official recognition of russian as a language ) . 
  i think it is important to have some balance and i have to say a lot of our media has been very propagandist over this crisis in almost exclusively covering one side of the conflict . 
  i do also broadly agree with his last paragraph on what needs to be done but would add russian forces should be withdrawn as well . 
  saying this though i really would n't say this is a good article as it is too forgiving of the russians and really just becomes a bashing of western government policy , which does have a small amount of merit but is overly concentrated on here with some gross misrepresentations . 
  [ the bbc has also done an article on the russian perspective that is more factual than this opinion piece ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26415508 ),

  since this sub at times basically seems like european / r/mapporn thought i 'd use a pretty map to capture your attention . 
  here 's a copy and paste of my post i put up over there : ok as i 'm sure some of you are already aware , the six nations will be kicking off this weekend on the 1st of february and runs to the the 15th of march . 
  i thought i 'd post this as though a large number of people ( that do indeed follow rugby ) will have heard of europe 's top rugby competition many rugby fans never realise there are several other competitions involving lower tier european nations going on at the same exact time every year . 
  even if you do n't think your country plays rugby you might be surprised as this map shows that most of europe 's countries do atleast have a national team that competes in international competition . 
  here 's some info if you 're interested : [ ** six nations ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/six_nations_championship ) - involves [ wales ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_rugby_union_team ) ( current champions ) , [ england ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/england_national_rugby_union_team ) , [ france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_national_rugby_union_team ) , [ ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ireland_national_rugby_union_team ) , [ scotland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scotland_national_rugby_union_team ) , and [ italy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italy_national_rugby_union_team ) . 
  - all of these teams have teams made up of full-time professionals playing in the [ english premiership ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aviva_premiership ) , [ french top 14 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/top_14 ) and [ celtic/italian pro12 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rabodirect_pro12 ) with most of these nations having long traditions of playing the sport and have sizable player bases . 
  all these nations have club participants in the [ heineken cup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heineken_cup ) ( rugby 's equivalent of football 's uefa champions league ) . 
  - this competition is run separately from the other european competitions by the six nations committee , with each team playing one another once annually with no relegation for the bottom team ( though this may be unpopular with smaller countries usually these teams are on a whole other level from other nations ) . 
  - for this years competition the favourites are probably again wales but ireland , england and france ( due to their constant unpredictability ) could all win it . 
  scotland and italy are both outsiders with the former being poor since the nineties and italy being admitted only in 2000 and are still improving . 
  - [ this years fixtures ] ( http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/matchcentre/index.php ) - [ international broadcast schedule ] ( http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/matchcentre/worldwide_broadcast_schedule.php ) with streams also being available online usually provided over at / r/rugbyunion . 
  - [ ** this years bbc six nations trailer ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7xlmuprcni ) [ ** european nations cup ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_nations_cup_ ( rugby_union ) ** enc 1a ** - this is the top tier of european rugby below the six nations with it and the divisions below being run by [ fira ] ( http://www.fira-aer-rugby.com/ ) - this year is important as unlike the the teams in the 6 nations who 've secured their their place in next years [ world cup ] ( http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/ ) these teams need to fight out for a place . 
  [ the first and second place teams at the end of this tournament will enter the rugby world cup while the third placed team goes into a rep\u00eachage with teams from other geographic regions to determine the final qualification spot ] ( http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/qualifying/ ) . 
  the bottom placed team at the end of this year will be relegated and replaced enc 1b 's winner . 
  - all of these countries have some degree of professionalism with many of their players participating in larger european leagues though some players are payed to play at home or for their union in [ international sevens ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irb_world_sevens_series ) in most of these countries . 
  two club teams from these nations can also qualify each year to compete in the [ amlin challenge cup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amlin_challenge_cup ) ( again the equivalent of football 's europa league ) along with teams from the six nations . 
  romania and georgia certainly are capable of giving [ top 10 ranked ] ( http://www.irb.com/rankings/sportid=1/index.html ) nations decent games and have earned victories in the past . 
  - a number of these games will likely be streamed by the [ irb ] ( http://www.irb.com/index.html ) on their website as they have done so in the past and may be available to watch on tv in participating countries . 
  ** enc 1b and below ** teams in these divisions are mostly made up of amateurs though there will be the odd pro here or there i.e. 
  [ erik lund ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erik_lund_ ( rugby_union ) and in particular enc 1b certainly has countries with competitive domestic competition .

  [ pics from edinburgh really do swamp / r/cityporn from time to time ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cityporn/search?q=edinburgh&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;count=26&amp;before=t3_npk7b ), 
  ah good to hear . 
  this along with the european cup fiasco really are getting annoying and i wish they could get sorted so we could discuss something else over there . 
  there 's been loads of stuff posted on this over at / r/rugbyunion in the last few weeks if you are interested . 
  it might be quite a slog to read it all as the sub has been flooded with these stories the last few weeks, 
  if i had to make a decision off the top of my head without really going into the parties european policies i 'd pick the liberal democrats or maybe the snp . 
  you 're completely right about the unionists ( dup ) not being able to annoy their powerbase at all as it is the main reason for their own rise to power after the uup was seen by loyalists to be too conciliatory after the good friday agreements . 
  there are plenty of many more radical and crazy unionist parties ready to jump in and knick seats in staunch loyalist strongholds . 
  exactly . 
  some people might see this trend as the exact opposite ( e.g. 
  * some * feminists ) as it opens up the possibility of women selling their bodies for a living which they view as an unacceptable occupation for their view of a modern society . 
  it may be a progressive move to legalise and regulate to some but it just depends on what your own political viewpoint is . 
  this is why i hate people using the word progressive in political debates on reddit as it seems to have become the case for some on this site that if something is stated as `` progressive '' , that it should automatically be the right course of action to take for those that are forward thinking . 
  it seems to be more of an american thing admittedly where their left in their debates often use the word nonchalantly for all of their political wishes with it devaluing the actual meaning of progressiveness in politics . 
  this really has become one of my pet peeves with reddit . 
  it 's the badge for the province of munster . 
  ok first of all , please do n't associate what i 'm saying here with the likes of what / u/bigrob1 has said below on britains history in ireland , as he is clearly being too absolving of the british side . 
  i just want to point out that comparing the famine to genocide really is not correct according to the general , modern , historic consensus in ireland and elsewhere . 
  it was a disaster brought about from a combination of : very poor management by a distant and some might say callous government ; landlords and other individuals who used the situation to profit at the expense of the many while being aided by the social environment in ireland at the time ; the laissez faire economic ideals of those in power of the day and of course a natural potato blight epidemic that was terribly damaging on the lumper potato crop that were the near sole variety of potato grown at the time on the island of ireland . 
  much of this is explained in detail in these two / r/askhistorians threads , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/w4ifx/historians_whats_your_take_on_the_argument_that/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1f93qn/why_exactly_did_the_irish_potato_famine_happen/ ) . 
  scotland also has a completely separate education system from the rest of the uk ( i.e. 
  we study standard grades/intermediate courses and highers while in the rest of the uk they study gcse 's and a-levels . 
  our education system also is seen to be based on a broader range of optional subjects while in the rest of the uk they specialise far earlier ) . 
  there are also smaller differences between england , wales and ni . 
  edit : scotland actually scored better than the uk average . 
   also keep in mind that gaelic has never been spoken across the ** entirety ** of the country, 
  he 's insinuating you 're irish as `` whiskey '' is their spelling . 
  also keep in mind that gaelic has never been spoken across the entirety of the country and that it has not been spoken by many outside the highlands and islands for the last 500 years . 
  this is why i think it could never be truly justified as a `` national '' language, 
  scotland has a strong national identity without having our own national language , so why do we need to go and promote a national language that would indeed seem foreign to many . 
  i myself certainly do n't want gaelic/scots as a national language or personally want independence but people i do know that support the nationalists do n't necessarily want a national language either . 
  the snps whole view of independence is that it is based on all people that live here and not on a particular ethnicity ( though there are several backers of gaelic within the snp ) . 
  there is also a saying that : `` the irish kept their nationalism but lost their language while welsh kept their language but ( somewhat ) lost their national identity . '', 
  i 'd say scotland is more like ireland in holding on to its strong identity ( but not necessarily wanting full independence ) . 
  yeah i was kinda dragging out a joke a bit too far there ... 
  but the communists were opposed to this ...
