  basically residency in scotland is the only requirement to vote in the referendum . 
  so english people in scotland can vote but scots living overseas ca n't . 
  yeah it 's usually 33 ~ % for , 45 ~ % against from what i 've seen . 
  yes but the question was : * `` how do you feel about scottish independence ? 
  '' * and your answer must have been : * `` i support independence '' *, 
  generally men have a greater interest in politics and current affairs in the uk atleast . 
  edit : mind you at the local level women do seem just as involved, 
  but there is a referendum and this does n't necessarily mean the majority support independence . 
  the better together campaign still has a fairly large lead in the polls . 
  only country to ever democratically elect the communist party into government . 
  edit : ok apparently it was only the first one to do so , thanks / u/ijflwe42 . 
  used to have an f1 race :(, 
  your a little late in replying to me . 
  yeah i basically agree with what your saying that the language spoken by scots gradually incorporated more and more english until we scots no longer spoke our own language, 
  [ ukraine or the ukraine ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18233844 ), 
  bread-basket of eastern europe . 
  it has some of the best arable land in the world . 
  you better change roi to pira for the last few paragraphs as they had no active involvement in the troubles, 
  i 've just watched the second episode of this and the guys a bit mad trying to go down the shankhill road talking to people in irish . 
  ok i agree with what your mostly saying here but i ca n't help but point out that on the west coast of scotland there are a lot of sectarian attitudes related to northern ireland . 
  can i just point out the way history is taught in england is very different from the way it is taught in scotland as we have separate education systems . 
  for example when the english are taught about 1066 , the tudors and shakespeare up here we 're learning about the scottish wars of independence , mary queen of scots and robert burns . 
  there was an equivalent to the workhouse in scotland as well . 
  there is a real problem with how many historians mention how al-andalus was by leaps and bounds a more tolerant society than the rest of europe . 
  in reality the ruling systems tolerance and progressiveness really did depend on what dynasty was in power ( with the earlier ruling families like the umayyads being most tolerant ) . 
  if you look at what the common view of a tolerant society was nowadays it would actually be seen as quite oppressive . 
  no worries . 
  do n't know why the link stopped taking folk to the photo, 
  ok for some reason the link stopped taking you to this : http://www.google.co.uk/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=672&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=yiffuci8cbte7aaapybo&amp;q=croke+park+no+english+sports&amp;oq=croke+park+no+english+sports&amp;gs_l=img.3...45391.62163.0.62479.37.33.0.4.4.3.233.3789.12j19j2.33.0....0...1c.1.19.img.vmk7agxvg2g#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=no+foreign+games+celtic&amp;oq=no+foreign+games&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0.22153.27889.2.30208.16.11.0.5.5.0.141.1273.1j10.11.0....0...1c.1.19.img.nacbuv0g5a4&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.zg4&amp;fp=426c5ede159064f4&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=624&amp;biv=i%7c41%3bd%7cwlcibas4soqdbm%3a&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=lsrm6ehvyovqem%3a%3be7f9u_fe9yppzm%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fi930.photobucket.com%252falbums%252fad150%252fedlavfc%252fnotoforeigngamesrsfstyle.jpg%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.politics.ie%252fforum%252fhistory%252f171694-silent-photo-thread-contains-graphic-images-141.html%3b199%3b280, 
  yeah but the purpose of this protest was that some radical republicans still did n't want irelands six nations games to be played there when lansdowne road was being redeveloped . 
  the gaa fully supported the games being played in croke park also i posted the photo because the protestor obviously does n't know what sports were invented in england . 
  it 's meant to be funny not political . 
  do you not get the irony in the photo ? 
  well i guess it would be hard to put in presidential election results as not every country has a president . 
  also france is rather unique among european countries as you are rather unique in how much power your president has while in most other countries it is a mostly ceremonial position so turnout is n't as high in elections, 
  just pointing the stupidity out on both sides !, 
  largely catholic and their pope was n't too popular . 
  arthur boric ( polish celtic goal-keeper ) did n't exactly endear himself to those of the community that support rangers fc either . 
  [ just for balance ... ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=672&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=yiffuci8cbte7aaapybo&amp;q=croke+park+no+english+sports&amp;oq=croke+park+no+english+sports&amp;gs_l=img.3...45391.62163.0.62479.37.33.0.4.4.3.233.3789.12j19j2.33.0....0...1c.1.19.img.vmk7agxvg2g#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=no+foreign+games+celtic&amp;oq=no+foreign+games&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0.22153.27889.2.30208.16.11.0.5.5.0.141.1273.1j10.11.0....0...1c.1.19.img.nacbuv0g5a4&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.zg4&amp;fp=426c5ede159064f4&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=624&amp;biv=i%7c41%3bd%7cwlcibas4soqdbm%3a&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=lsrm6ehvyovqem%3a%3be7f9u_fe9yppzm%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fi930.photobucket.com%252falbums%252fad150%252fedlavfc%252fnotoforeigngamesrsfstyle.jpg%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.politics.ie%252fforum%252fhistory%252f171694-silent-photo-thread-contains-graphic-images-141.html%3b199%3b280 ) edit : link was broken , sorry, 
  well spotted !, 
  [ this is what i always think of when i see the orange order mentioned ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ejegylygm ), 
  do n't forget the lions won the test series . 
  i 'm little worried people will forget about it after wimbledon today !, 
  i do think scotland will challenge you for best fried snacks and i wish we could challenge you at football but then i remembered we like our deep-fried haggis too much ... 
  yeah i think it 's more the case that scots has evolved into scottish english as if you look at the scots wikipedia page it 's basically standard english with a few different words added in and slightly different spellings . 
  i doubt that if anyone from down south would struggle to understand what 's being said once they get their ear for the accent . 
  scots really is n't actually it 's own language anymore , at the very most it 's a dialect . 
  if you go up to aberdeenshire i 'd say doric is almost its own language while if your really adventurous gaelic is still spoken in the western isles, 
  yeah i 'm not looking forward to the results as i imagine a lot of people have a romantic view on scottish independence . 
  i 'm a scot that supports the union but might reconsider if the [ tories get even crazier ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10133076/conservative-mps-launch-attempt-to-bring-back-death-penalty-privatise-the-bbc-and-ban-burka.html ) or england win the rugby world cup in 2015 ... 
  well that really is debatable that it was deliberate genocide in ireland as the more common view of nowadays is that the government was just uncaring and did n't try and make it worse for the irish people . 
  there was also a lot of ignorance of what was actually going on and many cruel individual landlords that took advantage of the situation to evict tenants for sheep grazing . 
  very few know that there was actually another famine in the scottish highlands at the same time but it was no where near as destructive as it did n't affect the whole country and the church along with many community groups kept the poor fed while there was no similar structure in ireland . 
  edit : though i guess you could point out that the owners of the estates would not be in place without the british, 
  ahh yes did n't notice it on the map as i was only searching for it in russia ... 
  is n't world of tanks russian ? 
  yeah i think here in the uk we eat the most cereal per capita worldwide !, 
  you could make it super expensive so people generally do n't drink as much !, 
  alot of these proposals seem to be similar to laws here in scotland ( with regards to restrictions on time alcohol can be sold , though it appears you will be able to buy drink early in the morning ) and france ( where you are not allowed to advertise alcohol ) . 
  i ca n't really see anything that is extremely oppressive and i think most of these laws are sensible as many of the proposals are to reduce drink driving . 
  to be honest i think many here are just critisising this bill as it is an islamist party that is proposing it . 
  if they do anything more than this then i might be concerned . 
  if they do n't understand us the first time we just keep raising our voices till they get it . 
  that 's the true british way of dealing with those continentals !, 
  but a lot of biblical names are similar in that they are derive from natural objects . 
  for example peter means rock or stone . 
  it 's just that these names are so common that we do n't think of them this way . 
  your last point could also be applied to the large number of northern irish that live in uk as well with many still having family back in ni . 
  i 'm a unionist ( in the scottish sense ) but i can still see that if scotland were to be independent , there would n't be too much difficulty in seeing relatives down south still . 
  i think style of government and peoples own individual sense of nationality rather than community nationality is now more important . 
  ok she can appear on the valleys then ... 
  is this your first year watching eurovision ? 
  what on earth are our brave troops doing in cyprus, 
  we should of colonised more of europe just for the sake of eurovision !, 
  damn it why did you say that . 
  they 're infront of us now !, 
  the girl from azerbaijan seemed to not know who to give 12 points to as there is no turkey this year, 
  yay we 're not at the bottom, 
  this is just trying to force turkey out of the competition permanently !, 
  no britain would potentially not survive if we left the eu as that would practically give the snp their yes vote ( which i would be less annoyed about if that was the case ) . 
  the government down south should get their act together and stop assuming that they have already won this referendum in 2014 !, 
  i ca n't find the bbc article on it but there was talk that if the uk did n't accept a shared sterling-zone then scotland would be able to refuse a share of the debt . 
  also it is n't clear whether scotland would automatically remain in eu automatically so the rest of the uk could not impose trade barriers on another eu member if scotland was still classed as one . 
  i am pro-union btw, 
  well i think if the rest of the country wants successor state status at the un they may theoretically have to keep the whole national debt if scotland does not automatically accept this . 
  but i sincerely hope you never get anywhere near deciding gun policy no hard feelings :-), 
  actually after 1994 the number of gun crimes only increased due to the new legislation ( i.e. 
  people holding on to handguns ) . 
  while in recent years gun crimes have drastically decreased [ with criminals turning to converting replica guns to procure firearms . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9744000/9744699.stm ) i also have a completely different viewpoint from you and see the us as why we should have strict gun controls . 
  i do feel that i 'd rather have my security of knowing there is a low risk of gun violence ere compared with having to see my liberty being intrinsically tied to gun ownership , as is the perception in some parts of the states . 
  i think the numbers show that there are many more tragedies in the [ us ] ( http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states ) each year related to guns than here in the [ uk ] ( http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-kingdom ) . 
  now go sit in your little bunker and wait for the world to end, 
  surely though it is better to keep the number of guns in public at a bare minimum so such unfortunate events do not occur in the first place . 
  guns can also make a threatening situation far more serious and you could likely end up shooting someone by using non-proportional force and end up in jail yourself . 
  i really do hope that you never do apply for a shotgun license as your reasoning for having a gun is sheer lunacy if you live here in the uk . 
  are you being serious ? 
  first of all i feel that it is not a necessary right to be able to carry a concealed firearm and governments are well within the law to suspend this presumed right as it presents the obvious chance of there being a danger to the public . 
  also can you give me an honest example of when you feel you would need a gun for self-defence purposes when out in public ? 
  i am pretty sure it is unlikely that you will run into such situations here in the uk because guns are so rare in our society .
