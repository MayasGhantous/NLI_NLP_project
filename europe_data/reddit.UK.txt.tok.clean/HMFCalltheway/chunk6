  plus having guns concealed means that there is more paranoia as you do n't know who else has a gun . 
  surely by your logic deterrence is better than actual confrontation . 
  ** edit ** : also you would n't necessarily need a concealed carry permit if the law were similar to that of switzerland ( as / u/lokarn already mentioned ) if you were just carrying a gun from a to b , when going to a gun range . 
  however i still would be opposed to this being implemented here and would only be reluctantly accepting if handguns were kept at the gun range/club . 
  why would anyone that is not a police officer or something similar need a concealed carry permit ? 
  also you need letters of reference for shotguns as well . 
  ok first of all when you say `` i 'd quite like to see guns be reintroduced '' , what exactly do you mean by that ? 
  do you want it to be the case that all guns are legal for purchase without a license or do you want specific types of guns available with licensing similar to shotguns ? 
  also why would scotland need a militia?we are hardly under immediate threat of invasion and it is n't like we would n't have allies to help defend us . 
  surely it is better to have a professional army that can prevent enemies reaching our borders in the first place .

  i know these are political leaders that are making threats but why are n't they being arrested for this if they are issuing death threats ? 
  anyone that did that here would be arrested immediately !, 
  no i 'm not disagreeing with what / u/loiny is saying . 
  i 'm just moaning about all the cybernats and essay writers that always fill the comments sections in / r/scotland . 
  you actually read through all of that ? 
  that along with the usual bias of / r/scotland are the main reasons that i usually avoid that subreddit . 
  thought you guys would find this interesting : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19641398, 
  yeah the police always call for an armed response unit if they encounter any criminals with firearms . 
  however this is probably a rarer occurrence over here due to our strict gun laws and the fact we 're an island so it is difficult to bring in guns . 
  there was an article on the bbc a while ago about how criminals now use safe houses that loan out guns because it is actually extremely difficult to obtain one so they wo n't chuck the gun if they use it in a crime as it is simply too valuable, 
  if the eu did ever come up with a coat of arms like [ this ] ( http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121129223950/conworld/images/f/fe/coat_of_arms_of_the_european_union.png ) , ukip would have a field day going on about european imperialism !, 
  ** edit : ** not too sure if the habsburgs would like this either ... 
  i think there are actually several hundred thousand brits in spain . 
  heard somewhere that it 's close to 500000 but that does sound a bit too high !, 
  my flat-mate , who is a law student , had a little look into it and apparently it probably is n't as big a case as this article is making it out to be . 
  it was a ruling taken by an employment tribunal so in this case they found that statements against zionism were n't anti-semitic but in another case another ruling maybe produced . 
  well i agree with you on the first few points however the unions really were out of control . 
  my dad often brings up the winter of discontent when the buses did n't run at all and there were severe power shortages . 
  could actually believe that a standard 3-day working week is actually economically feasible ? 
  because that was what the the unions were calling for . 
  also many of the industries were not profitable and would of collapsed at some point if they had been left the way they were . 
  it definitely could of been handled better with the workers being offered careers in alternative fields and the draconian police tactics . 
  basically what i 'm saying is that the situation that prevailed before thatcher came to power could n't continue but it should of been handled differently . 
  it was just a ruse to fool the english into thinking we were pathetic at empire building ... 
  turned out quite well for us in the end with regards to foreign conquest . 
  remember it was david livingston that opened up africa for colonisation and two scots started a war with china so we could sell them ship-loads of opium !, 
  [ what about this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/us_virgin_islands ), 
  well that was surreal ... 
  we have the same problem over here in the uk . 
  we do accept iraqi translators as asylum seekers but i do n't think they receive any benefits in comparison to any other refugees ( i.e. 
  they do n't get fast-tracked citizenship ) . 
  we mostly just seem to dump them in a high-rise flat in glasgow and leave them to beg for a living . 
  the treatment they get is pretty horrific, 
  [ how about this war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_war_of_jenkins%27_ear ), 
  apparently he is very against kirchner back in argentina . 
  also i do n't seriously think any modern pope would try and start a war ( and there were quite a few popes that instigated violence in the past ) . 
  well it looks like they may have just done something like that ... 
  i think it 's because it was as a result of the 9/11 attacks being on mainland america . 
  also the americans do unofficially run nato ... 
  well this is a completely different view of europe from most fellow farming folk i 've came across in east lothian . 
  i 'd say that it is only the old and cynical retired farmers , that are no longer working day in day out that have these sort of views . 
  first of all the paper work is nothing compared to the massive benefits that the eu provides . 
  for example the eu does allow for easy free trade meaning spare parts for modern equipment can easily be brought over from germany and the netherlands with there also being exchanges of information through travel between the uk and the continent of merchants and traders . 
  it is also ridiculous to complain about eastern european workers as i would say that they have been a huge asset to us and we would struggle to find people to pick tatties otherwise ( and in my personal experience have definitely had more problems when i 've worked with certain locals who start fights with the other workers ) . 
  the eu ( along with the scottish government ) has also encouraged diversification of land use and my dad would never have put up wind turbines otherwise which has strengthened our business i would say that the eu offers many more benefits than just cap and i am a firm supporter of us continuing in it . 
  this is the traditional scottish/british pate equivalent : [ potted meat ] ( http://imgur.com/ssbk7xj ), 
  [ you think you struggle to get good attendances for league games in england ... ] ( http://www.premiershiprugby.com/matchcentre/fixtures/22312.php ) my team , edinburgh are struggling to get over 5000 people to come to our games ( admittedly we are quite shit at the moment ) !, 
  i think he might of done the french dubbing for inglorious basterds aswell as he is fluent in french . 
  the only language that he spoke in , in the original version , that he is not fluent in was italian . 
  actually this has happened on rare occasions between the us and uk aswell . 
  for example , `` harry potter and the philosopher 's stone '' became `` harry potter and the sorcerers stone '' in the us because apparently some americans had never heard of the word before ? 
  bet some mad republicans have got abortions registered as homicides in certain states ... 
  to be fair to sweden these results can be skewed by extremely effective policing and legal definitions being different in different countries . 
  it 's why sweden has the highest sexual assault rate in europe, 
  just wanted to hear your argument first . 
  are you saying that there maybe something genetic about this ??? 
  well if this is your misguided view i would like to point out that many of those areas with high homicide rates have people of spanish ancestry ( i.e. 
  mexicans ) and british ancestry ( i.e. 
  americans ) . 
  while in these countries in europe there is a relatively low homicide rate in comparison to the whole united states . 
  also i would argue that factors such as the prevalence of urban poverty , high levels of social problems such as alcoholism ( that can be experienced by any ethnicity ) and the high ownership of firearms have a far greater impact on homicide rates . 
  i think it is a very dangerous to dismiss these problems as the result of a specific group as this means that the core problem is never tackled . 
  how is this relevant to homicide rates may i ask ??

  are you thinking of chavs/neds ? 
  census data for scotland was released not long after england and wales ( roughly 2-3 days ), 
  i know it is an approximate distribution map but it really should n't show the whole of wales as being welsh speaking . 
  it 's only the nw of wales that 's has always traditionally spoken welsh . 
  i 'm assuming it is historical as it does show yiddish on the map so the range of scottish gaelic could even be expanded !, 
  why does this not include scotand, 
  ** found it !!!, 
  ** this is a very interesting read and i should make a correction that italy actually have 66,000 players not 80000 : http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tomfordyce/2012/01/why_scotland_are_better_than_e.html, 
  have to say that if you think rugby is n't developed enough in italy you should really look at scotland . 
  with only 38,000 players in comparison to italy 's near 80,000 , it shows that we really are punching above our weight when it comes to competing in the six nations ( not to mention that we only have something like a mere 90 fully professional players in top competitions ) . 
  i know that scotland is an established rugby nation but in comparison to wales and ireland , that have similar populations sizes , it shows that we really should be producing more . 
  the real problem here is that rugby is really confined to private schools and the borders , with there still being a stigma in many parts that it is posh boys sport . 
  if you can find it , there was a very interesting article about six nations success in relation to playing population about a year ago on the bbc sports website ( which i remember because it showed scotland in a very good light ) !, 
  joezee , you really just should not of mentioned you were from palestine ... 
  please do n't think we 're all still massive imperialists like this idiot !, 
  ok you are clearly biased though as a self proclaimed lib dem voter .
