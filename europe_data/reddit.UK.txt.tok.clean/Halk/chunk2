  i do n't care as long as france deals with her problems . 
  there seem to be a lot of people outside of the uk wanting independence because it 's seen to be anti-uk - consider if texas wanted to secede then many non-us people would be cheering them on to do it for the same reason . 
  also some people consider it to be pro-scottish . 
  i also think that nations seeking independence tend to be oppressed so it 's natural to want to support them . 
  there 's also a large , active , hostile , aggressive group of pro-independence people who have been called `` cybernats '' who troll around the internet . 
  on reddit that means lots of downvotes . 
   / u/halk has already decided that `` independence would be an absolute disaster as anyone with any sense and understanding says '' . 
  you 've certainly not tried to change my mind . 
  i 'm quite happy to consider anything to have to say . 
  we wo n't be good neighbours if it goes `` yes '' for a few years while the press and politicians point fingers across the borders . 
  but it 'll get back to normal eventually . 
  nah , unless it 's much much much busier today the crowd is n't as bad as it looks , it causes a bit of a jam getting around the corner from buchannan street to sauchiehall street but there 's no reason to close buchannan street underground . 
  by waving a flag ? 
  by ad hominem attacks ? 
  that 's all the yes campaign have . 
  [ with threats ? 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-independence/scottish-independence-fear-and-loathing-in-the-battle-for-scotland-9730442.html ) this is n't supposed to be a fair contest . 
  it 's not a fucking school debate . 
  both sides are not supposed to be equal . 
  independence will be an unmitigated disaster and there is n't an equal counter argument to that . 
  [ here 's a useful summary of it from the spectator on what an entirely independent deutche bank report has to say . 
  ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/09/deutsche-banks-devastating-analysis-scottish-independence-would-bring-austerity-on-a-scale-never-seen-before/ ), 
  yes supporters act no differently to football fans . 
  independence would be an absolute disaster as anyone with any sense and understanding says - but that does n't matter , keep waving banners and shouting . 
  sigh . 
  one week and it 'll all be over for better or worse and if it does go badly and we go independent at least we wo n't have to suffer the insufferable yes wankers waving more flags . 
  edit : for an explanation the bit of road shown here is pedestrian only and it 's right in the centre of glasgow . 
  this picture has been taken from the steps ( i think ) looking southward . 
  on the left is buchannan galleries , a shopping centre ( mall ) and on the right is sauchiehall street - a long street of shops . 
  the area the picture is taken of is almost a chokepoint and if you go shopping in glasgow city then you will pass through it at some point . 
  [ this is what it normally looks like looking north . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dwathvv.jpg ) you can see the statue of donald dewar in both photos . 
  build more detention centres instead of shipping them to britain . 
  it 's a totally french attitude to shrug your shoulders and say `` meh '' while the uk is castigating france for lazy selfish immigration control , france should be doing the same to italy . 
   you ca n't detain people without a trial . 
  that goes against basic humans ' right . 
  you absolutely can . 
  you can detain them for what they 're doing with the trucks - it 's dangerous . 
  you can detain them for being illegal immigrants too . 
  however it does n't matter a fuck . 
  france does n't have border controls - that 's france 's problem . 
  the whole of the continent does n't care about illegal immigrants because each country just encourages them on to the next . 
  they wo n't . 
  they 'll be in france until they get to the uk . 
  gross annual income and net monthly income are what 's measured in the uk . 
  not for a very long time we have n't . 
  and if you want to look into the past why not look at your own country - you only last year forgave people for fighting against the nazis . 
  i 'm not responsible for the british empire and you 're not responsible for irish neutrality in ww2 . 
  so do n't throw fucking stones . 
  i also do n't like people on the sidelines saying `` go scotland '' as some sort of fucking entertainment . 
  it 's pretty much the same as encouraging someone to jump out a window because you want to see the splatter . 
  our national anthem has a verse about crushing jacobites who at the time were papists trying to take the crown back from protestants . 
  it does not mean crushing scots in general . 
  the union is everybody on the same island with very similar culture and language , the same currency etc joining together . 
  it 's certainly evolved since the act of union . 
  murdoch seems to be in favour of it , he feels betrayed by the british establishment and he 'd love for scotland to leave to get one up on them . 
  anyone who claims to be sure of the outcome is an imbecile . 
  i find it especially insulting . 
  it sounds very much that everybody else is cheering on the scots vs britain which is not what is happening . 
  the hopeful dreamers sucked in by snp lies vs the rest of us . 
  it 's not a question if we ** can ** do it or not . 
  we could do all sorts of stupid things . 
  let 's not though . 
  they must apply for it in france ( or wherever they arrived first ) . 
  you just ship them on to britain first chance you get , same as italy and spain . 
  [ ours has a particularly long and interesting history . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stone_of_scone ) [ scotland 's stone of destiny . 
  ] ( http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/images/stone-of-destiny-large_tcm4-562976.jpg ) i 'd say that 's pretty cool but not in a visually impressive way !, 
  i realise this is tongue in cheek and not true ... 
  but i ca n't remember ever hearing anything bad about the czech republic . 
  what 's bad about it that everybody seems to be keeping a secret ? 
  it benefits germany to be on the same side as everybody else . 
  without germany joining in on sanctions it makes the west appear weak and divided and allows putin movement to slice up more territory . 
  deterioration will occur as and when putin pulls off more bad shit . 
  he 'll pull of more bad shit when he thinks he 'll get away with it . 
  he 'll get away with it when everybody else has n't already decided what the response will be . 
  in short what needs to happen is that the west needs to decide what the next wave of sanctions are and lay down the conditions so that putin knows we will have no choice but to impose them . 
  if the territorial integrity of the ukraine had been backed by a pact which obligated the eu to intervene militarily then putin would not have annexed crimea . 
  he knows what he 's doing and he 's no fool . 
  he knows the eu/nato will not push forward with an attack and will only act reactively , so all he needs to do is one step at a time until we get unified . 
  [ watch this from 20 seconds in . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe ) it 's making a similar point - that the russians will advance because they know we wo n't push the button . 
  in this case the russians advance because they know we 're not committed to a robust response . 
  [ what about this one instead ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/scottish_union_jack.jpg ), 
  i 'm afraid i posted this yesterday and it was widely seen in this subreddit . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/yes,_minister#episode_five:_the_devil_you_know ) one is mine . 
  or maybe [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0zzjxw4mta ), 
  it 's such a good programme , there 's no slack in it , every scene is worthwhile , every line is perfectly timed and perfectly written . 
  on top of it all , they managed to do it without a single bit of agenda showing . 
  this is from in my opinion the best british sit-com every written . 
  it dates from the cold war period , and it questions what happens when russia tries salami tactics - what is the response . 
  you 'll see it 's still relevant . 
  europe seems to love nothing better than a circle jerk anti-us post . 
  it 's grandstanding . 
  certainly things could be much better , but it sounds something along the lines of godwin 's law - you 're just as bad as north korea !, 
  the attitude you 're talking about is what lets labour walk away with things . 
  if it 's any consolation it was the attitude up here , and the snp took a ot of seats from them . 
  i may be against independence , but the snp in general govern better than labour do .
