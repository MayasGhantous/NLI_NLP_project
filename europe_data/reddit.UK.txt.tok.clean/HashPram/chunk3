  they either taste as savoury as ummami , or bitter as wormwood depending on who you feed them to !, 
  france never wanted us in the eu in the first place so this comes as no surprise . 
  they are , all of them , a complete bloody waste of space . 
  and how does this relate to the idea that clubbing together allows for better bargaining power ? 
  yes let 's just pick one example , clearly that will give a representative picure of the situation . 
  being called `` the economist '' is like giving everyone a massive clue about your main focus of interest ? 
  welcome to english political discussion where any sign that the other side might be winning the argument is met with ad hominem arguments , whataboutery , cherry-picked statistics , or just changing the subject . 
  and then we complain about the quality of political debate . 
  given a sufficiently large amount of time everything is an historical footnote . 
  the eu allows a large number of disparate nations to compete as a single unit when negotiating trade deals and this is a good thing . 
  whether or not britain chooses to be in or out it would be a monumentally silly idea to scrap it . 
  i welcome it . 
  tbh honest i could do with the peace and quiet . 
  i do n't have an opinion of her per se over and above the fact that she seems like a decent human being . 
  not so keen on the monarchy as an institution though . 
  depends . 
  rock gig ? 
  pushy crowd . 
  post office counter ? 
  queue . 
  still there , growing . 
  one day its children will inherit the earth . 
   do you binge drink ? 
  occasionally . 
   like to passive aggressively tut at people ? 
  i shout at other drivers when i 'm driving . 
  i guess this makes me un norte americano . 
   love a good queue ? 
  i hate queues . 
  i sometimes wonder what kind of englishman i am . 
  i do n't like football or cricket ( sport in general tbh ) , i do n't watch tv very often and when i do it 's on-demand rather than broadcast , and i rarely drink tea when i 'm at home . 
  well social science can utilise control groups , much as medicine does . 
  sure you 're not controlling every variable , but you do n't do that when testing new medicines - you compare a generalised result from lots of randomised trials of the new medicine against a generalised result from a randomized control group and see what the general lie of the land is . 
  sometimes it 's inconclusive , sometimes it is n't but you need meta-studies to show that ( stuff like the cochrane collaboration does ) . 
  the principal difference between social science and medicine is that , generally speaking , the end-point is more clearly defined ... did the patient get better or not ? 
  with social science we can tell if intervention a was more effective than intervention b in achieving goal x , but there might be a big debate about whether goal x is what we need to be aiming for at all . 
  still science , broadly speaking , simply consists of : * make observations ; * think of interesting questions ; * formulate hypotheses ; * develop data predictions ; * gather data to test predictions ; * refine/alter/expand / reject hypotheses ; * develop general theories * repeat this method is n't just limited to physics and we should resist the notion that all the methods and ideals that apply to physics should and must apply to other disciplines . 
  * edit * couple of words . 
  this is an over-generalisation but is n't this decision-making process just an implementation of scientific method ? 
  i 'm merely intolerant of * some * differing creeds , beliefs , or opinions , not * any * differing creed , belief , or opinion . 
  if disliking rhetoric aimed at the sequacious is bigotry , then i 'm completely and utterly hitler . 
  or fart ? 
  i do hope you 're joking . 
  shit puns , inflammatory rhetoric with ~ ~ few ~ ~ no facts to back it up , xenophobia , clich\u00e9 , self-aggrandisement , halcyon-days appeal to history , plus - bonus !, 
  - pictures of some of the most gormless politicians ever to stalk the earth during my 46 years on this god-forsaken rock . 
  thas was such a shit piece of writing i am now clubbing my brain with a very heavy magnet . 
  either it will erase my memory of reading it or , more hopefully , result in my death - a considerably more prefereable fate than having to exist in the same universe with whatever collection of ... things wrote this . 
  same video but without the browser crashing dailymotion 1000 adverts per page bullshit : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zvd_vlo9xcc i 'd never watched this before : it 's a fine piece of physical comedy and he makes a very convincing drunk  sameprceduresseeea ? 
  i think having a balanced view of the eu and coming down in favour of disliking it is a valid opinion . 
  just having the view `` the eu is shit '' is n't really so much an opinion as the sound of someone 's knee jerking via their mouth . 
  i works better on a certain section of the british people because they are idiots , but then i do n't think britain necessarily has a monopoly on idiots . 
  first there would be a 5-10 year period of `` we 're just clearing up the mess left us by brussels '' , followed by another 5-10 year period of `` let 's all just stop talking about brussels '' . 
  and * then * we 'll start picking on the irish again . 
  or something . 
  it varies quite a bit depending on the city and how far from the centre you are . 
  in sheffield , for example , the heavy industry used to be on the north side of the city and the prevailing wind blew the soot and smoke eastwards . 
  so the rich built their houses further from the industry and away from where the soot would fall - in the south and west - and put their workers cottages nearer the factories .

   `` under powers given to the commission in 2014 , he can trigger a `` rule of law mechanism '' for countries that depart from democratic norms by putting a government under constitutional supervision . 
  ultimately , a country can be stripped of voting rights in the eu or have funding blocked .

  do n't see what the big fuss is tbh . 
  as someone else observes [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/fdsafdaw3f3acvsda )  the measures are intended to deal with member states that have seriously breached article 2 of the teu . 
  ( the process for applying the sanctions are briefly explained in article 7 ) the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  these values are common to the member states in a society in which pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men prevail . 
  yes , indeed - let 's blow something up out of all proportion !, 
  that would certainly be in keeping with terrorism !, 
  or , we could just have a nice big cup of calm your tits and start looking at [ relative risk ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/causes_of_death_statistics ) and why we should probably be more afraid of the thing that will actually kill us instead of over-reacting to whatever the latest media-panic thing is . 
  until literally millions of people are being killed every day by terrorists you still are statistically unlikely to die of a terrorist attack . 
  hardly . 
  you 're saying i need to be frightened of people who want to blow me up ? 
  i 'm saying i stand more chance of being randomly killed by the universe . 
  that 's not whataboutism it 's a point about fear and relative risk . 
  want to be afraid ? 
  think about cancer , liver disease , areterioscleoris and alzheimers because statistically they are the things that are going to get you . 
  terrorists , not so much . 
  whataboutism - in relation to the post i was replying to - would be `` but the far right are racists how can you possibly trust them to have a balanced opinion of muslims '' because [ whataboutery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) involves pointing out someone else 's failings when they point out yours in an effort to distract from the fact that they 're making a valid point . 
  you want to see top-drawer whataboutery try starting a thread about china criticising the us in / r/worldnews and see what the top comments consist of . 
  thank you for your pointless sarcasm !, 
  it really helped me to understand that terrorism really is to be feared and i should live my entire life gibbering in a corner frightened to go out because of some fucking boogeyman some pillock with an agenda created in order to control my behaviour !, 
  thanks again !, 
  love & kisses !, 
  the risk of terror * is * ever-present . 
  you live on a dying ball of rock , orbiting a massive continuous thermonuclear explosion , hurtling around a freezing vacuum in a universe devoid of teleological cause . 
  and when your life ends that 's it - no pearly gates , just a blackness you 'll never experience because your neurons have stopped firing . 
  scares the shit out of me when i think about that . 
  terrorists , meanwhile , are just some cunts out to make life difficult for everyone else . 
  i laugh in their stupid faces . 
  englishise . 
  to forcibly invade other countries and make them adopt your customs and language , then disbelievingly complain that they hate you . 
   just then they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that rise from that plain . 
  and no sooner did don erdogan see them that he said to his squire , `` fortune is guiding our affairs better than we ourselves could have wished . 
  do you see over yonder , friend , thirty or forty hulking giants ? 
  i intend to do battle with them and slay them . 
  with their spoils we shall begin to be rich for this is a righteous war and the removal of so foul a brood from off the face of the earth is a service god will bless . '', 
  naval power , i guess . 
  also cats ( germans ) eat fish . 
  maybe .
