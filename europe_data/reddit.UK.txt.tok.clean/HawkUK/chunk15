  pft ... we have to get oil delivered . 
  no gas mains . 
  also until recently plenty of villages around here pumped sewerage into the sea untreated . 
  in the more distant future , that 's what i 'd hope would be covered . 
  realised i typoed with the # 12.50 . 
  it 's actually # 12.90 . 
  but no , it 's not a one plan . 
  it 's just unlimited data , but with a cap on tethering ( 2gb or 4gb i think ) . 
  the same plan costs # 15 now , but they have n't increased the bill so far ( fingers crossed ) . 
  so far no caps or limits , but i only average 5 gigs a month anyway . 
  wait . 
  you use vodafone in cornwall !? 
  are you a sadomasochist ? 
  seriously though , it 's a fair point , but i do like the idea of going abroad and not having to worry about being stung with a ridiculous bill so i guess that does n't bother me when i think about it . 
  which states ? 
  i 'd guess spain just because telefonica . 
  i 'm with three and i get 200 mins , 5000 texts and * unlimited data * for # 12.50 . 
  i 'm pretty happy with it tbh . 
  the suggestion from / u/boq would be fine . 
  three 's `` feel at home '' service is similar . 
  if you 're taking the piss and are found to be in spain for months when you signed your contract in the uk , you 'll get cut off . 
  have they really ? 
  i 've found prices to be pretty good ... 
  simply because of its ridiculous dominance in the uk , though it 's supposedly waning . 
  i still use it though . 
  well we tried with scotland  . 
  yeah , what the hell did we do !, 
  you do actually have to apply for jobs ( and show evidence of doing so ) to get jsa . 
  pressure on housing and low paid jobs . 
  the former is our fault for allowing too few homes to be built though . 
  well . 
  then . 
  #then fire ze missiles !, 
  the wildlife does that . 
  strategically insignificant ? 
  it 's our base for bombing the entire middle east ffs . 
  you 'd need to use quite a few to take out a single [ city ] ( http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;kt=100&amp;lat=52.3702157&amp;lng=4.8951679&amp;hob_opt=1&amp;hob_psi=5&amp;hob_ft=4755&amp;ff=50&amp;zm=13 ) . 
  realistically with russia , they 'd all end up landing on moscow . 
  only about 40 per boat for some reason . 
  seems stupid to have a half-loaded gun , but c'est la vie . 
  apparently this is a great idea because we may wish to launch just one warhead at a target ... it 'd be interesting to know a possible scenario requiring that kind of attack . 
  we do n't export them though , and neither do the french . 
  which bases ? 
  so long as we continue to fill it with eurosceptic tories and kippers . 
  if you did n't mind thatcher it was ok , i suppose . 
  a huge boost , but still never went over 50 % like the uk . 
  no , i said it was the most pro-brexit i 'd ever felt . 
  overall not enough to flip me . 
  i care for your opinion about as much as i care for obama 's . 
  where did i say i was leaving ? 
  ( your comment was definitely posted after i made the edit for clarification ) . 
  thanks obama . 
  ^ ( seriously , this is the most pro-brexit i 've felt so far . 
  he can fuck off . ), 
  edit : for the record i 'm a bremainer . 
  less so than water , which is why weak beer used to be drunk in the navy . 
  she looks more mediterranean than black . 
  european residential areas are always very quiet . 
  as others have said , commuting to work does lead to [ dormitory towns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commuter_town ) and areas . 
  one reason i 've always been interested in visiting india is just how ridiculously * busy * it looks , but i always assumed residential areas were just as quiet as ours . 
  the assassination of princess diana . 
  we even have our own separatist terrorist group !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornish_national_liberation_army they 're a bit rubbish really . 
  sounds so good . 
  sounds all ancient and mystical , but probably not real , like avalon . 
  i 've had them in newcastle a couple of times ... 
  kind of want . 
  also want a [ parmo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parmo ) . 
  not since it merged with an american company decades ago . 
  everyone calls it bp . 
  we noticed when he emphasised british in a nasty industrial accident . 
  it did not look at all friendly . 
  i live in cornwall and yes we are ... 
  i quite liked the semi-united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  i 'm glad they do n't . 
  we have enough names in casual use already ... 
  i 've not managed to find one . 
  technically we are ## the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland it 's the longest country name in the world ... at least in english . 
  thinking about pussy riot . 
  just the name . 
  i mean , sucks that they got in serious trouble . 
  but it is a shipping lane ? 
   the channel has traffic on both the uk-europe and north sea-atlantic routes , and is the ** world 's busiest seaway ** , with over 500 ships per day . 
  living up to your name i see ... 
  still generally referred to here as the real ira . 
  previous party tricks include : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omagh_bombing, 
  yeah ... i 'm gon na set one off in mayfair . 
  ~ 20 miles at the narrowest . 
  from [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_channel ) :  it is about 560 km ( 350 mi ) long and varies in width from 240 km ( 150 mi ) at its widest to ** 32.3 km ( 20.1 mi ) in the strait of dover ** . 
  yup , anyone who 's actually neutral is probably more likely to be persuaded to stay in by this leaflet . 
  sure , some will say it pushed them the other way , but i suspect they were already lost . 
  yup , most missiles have a `` minimum '' range , as well as a maximum . 
  you do put on quite a show to be fair . 
  it 's mental !, 
  tried to avoid it , but i 've started to quite enjoy it . 
  you would get sent straight out for that , if you did n't withdraw it . 
  you can jeer . 
  you can attack policies and joke about what 's happened in the media . 
  but you * can not * insult someone directly : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/dennis-skinner-fans-us-ejected-parliament-dodgy-dave-david-cameron-bercow-rant-video-a6982366.html, 
  that 's as stupid as saying india does n't matter because its financial sector is comparatively rubbish .
