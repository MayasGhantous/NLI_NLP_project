  that parallels are lovely . 
  i 've heard complains of `` talking britain down '' , which until now had only been said as a joke - a parody of `` talking scotland down '' . 
  well you 're not meant to use it * too * often . 
  it 's getting better . 
  the tripoli-based government stepped down the other day . 
  should he change his name then ? 
  i still like it actually , sorry for the hyperbole , but i think it 's not as good now that you can buy it basically everywhere . 
  maybe that 's just because i have it more often though ... 
  i think these guys are good : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hotel_chocolat but they 're pricey and will probably turn to shit like thorntons did . 
  to be fair that was back in 2004 . 
  i also remember being charged by a gypsy to use a urinal . 
  in retrospect maybe that was optional . 
  i suppose we do have some local discounts over here , but they 're usually at the county level ... 
  i remember being charged more to visit tourist attractions in romania than romanians were , so i guess we do accept it in the real world  . 
  the ellipses were supposed to represent an incomplete list . 
  apparently i should have put singapore instead of hk though : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_financial_centres_index, 
  well , i suppose it was going to have to be london , nyc or hong kong ... 
  probably easier to hit them at a less secure location , like this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brighton_hotel_bombing now , thatcher did n't die , being just outside the blast area . 
  but if the bomb had been a little bigger , or she 'd been in the bathroom , she 'd quite likely have been dead . 
  others seem to suggest that this way he may have a * small * chance to remain pm . 
  just seen the [ tweet by the ap  ( https://twitter.com/ap/status/717338119629103104 )  breaking : iceland : president refuses pm 's request to dissolve government amid offshore tax scandal . 
  what the hell iceland !, 
  it 'd just find it funny because she seems to be left-wing . 
  like , i can totally understand david cameron hiding money because he 's a tory . 
  but if jeremy corbyn was found out , it would be ** amazing ** . 
  merkel pls . 
  it seems that way . 
  i guess turkey believe that if they stop being seen as a stepping stone to europe for non-syrians , the problem will solve itself . 
  i think they 're talking about something like this , where jobs are only advertised outside the uk : http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/800000-uk-jobs-advertised-across-europe-and-foreign-jobseekers-even-get-travelling-costs-8734731.html for example i know a daffodil farm near me that almost exclusively employs lithuanian pickers . 
  completely agree . 
  most people here who are generally against migration would absolutely make a special case for any translators . 
  i just would n't expect an mp to have ~ 200 pins ready to go ( or 30 for the eu , where the uk is split ) . 
  probably more believable than one-day delivery though . 
  for every country in the world you 'd need ~ 20000 types . 
  though for eu ( with split uk ) that 's still 465 types . 
  i 've found the most recent pmqs here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq5jks8wlz4 dated 23rd march ( the day after the brussels attacks \\* , which is why it begins with that ) . 
  plenty of jeering around the 12 minute mark and probably the rest !, 
  keep in mind what / u/romanabramovich said - it 's just 30 minutes each week and is quite different to the rest of the time . 
  \\* how the hell did that snp mp manage to get a scottish flag crossed with a belgian flag the day after the attacks !, 
  who the fuck is john wight ? 
   at least twenty bombs exploded in the space of eighty minutes , most within a half hour period . 
  holy shit . 
  would sir perhaps be interested in a schengen agreement ? 
  fair point . 
  there do seem to be a number of guys who are `` happy to help '' but do n't want to get their hands too dirty directly . 
  so ... what are they waiting for ? 
  i think there are easily 440 + who kinda like the idea , but most wo n't go through with it . 
  yeah , our conservatives have been trying to brand themselves as the party for workers . 
  which is actually quite easy to do when the main opposition is more interested in benefits ... 
  well . 
  it 's free . 
  so it 's got that going for it ... 
  they do . 
  homelessness usually requires substance abuse . 
  why is it called tenderloin ? 
  yes , but it 's the biggest of the two . 
  they do both appear to be on [ the list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  also :  during its history , british forces or forces with a british mandate have invaded , had some control over or fought conflicts in 171 of the world 's 193 countries that are currently un member states , or nine out of ten of all countries ( or 89 % of un nations ) . 
  wow . 
  no-one . 
  it 's all fucking self-service these days . 
  mainland uk , presumably . 
  i 'm of the opinion that northern ireland should do what northern ireland wants to do . 
  yeah , we stopped singing that anti-scottish verse in gstq . 
  well bring it back if you 're mean !, 
  it would be an improvement . 
  we basically have eight every year , but occasionally get an extra one thrown in . 
  there 's a convenient government webpage here : https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays note that we got an extra one back in 2012 for the queen 's diamond jubilee . 
  also be aware that things are * slightly * different in scotland an northern ireland . 
  it 's not like you guys are the only ones to have bad minibus crashes . 
  we 've had one or two pretty bad ones : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m40_minibus_crash it 's been tightened up a lot in recent years ( most schools/clubs will require drivers to have completed a course on safety for example ) . 
  find me the worst passage in the nt . 
  i 'm atheist by the way . 
  why does n't your city/county/state declare independence ? 
  christianity is pretty tame . 
  all the bad stuff is in the old testament . 
  far too luxurious . 
  i volunteer [ rockall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rockall ) . 
  nah , just annoyed that they did n't use new names . 
  i would consider an attack on a policeman by either the ira or isis for political aims to be a terrorist attack . 
  both are scum . 
  maybe in the summer . 
  that 's about it . 
  depends how low they want to go . 
  if they feel like copying the peshawar attack , nowhere is safe . 
  we 're still safe in cornwall . 
  nobody 's driving five hours to blow themselves up . 
  it will work for the smaller countries . 
  it would be a mess for the uk as we 'd presumably be pulled out of [ five eyes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes ) . 
  i did n't say definitively that there were none , just that there were no reports . 
  it was odd not to hear any follow up . 
  fair point . 
  added . 
  latest on sky is that 15 are dead on the metro . 
  also some strange reports of deaths at a police station from ap . 
  i do n't think we 'll really know until the afternoon . 
  i think there 's a lot of confusion still . 
  so i think it could be a lot higher . 
  this does n't look good : [ nsfl ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s2gonso.png ) there may be some double-counting of explosions going on . 
  looks pretty bad to me .
