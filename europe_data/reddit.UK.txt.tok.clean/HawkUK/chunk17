  scene from inside the metro : [ nsfl ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s2gonso.png ) how crowded would the metro be at this time in the morning ? 
  in total it 's confirmed as 20 +, 
  i do n't understand this . 
  there do n't seem to be any reports of deaths/injuries from gunfire . 
  maybe it was the security services ? 
  it just does n't look right though : http://i.imgur.com/bno81bj.png, 
  your flag looks awfully familiar : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_india_company#flags, 
  and cornwall . 
  yeah maybe , but not ya . 
  we 'll just build a fuck-off great wall !, 
  i 'm joking and playing up to the national stereotype . 
  i love the cultural stuff !, 
  i mean , those look nice and all , but really i just want a few beers and a quiet corner to be sick in . 
  that 's absolutely amazing . 
  thread started by a canadian ffs . 
  i think there has been a growth in the artisan bread market in recent years . 
  fancy bread is quite popular now . 
  lift - british english elevator - american english however we have `` chairlifts '' for old people , which do go at a angle . 
  in some ways , this device reminds me of a ski-lift . 
  coaches do , sure . 
  i can remember the teachers walking up the coach to check we were all belted up . 
  thing is most muslim terrorists are dead . 
  something something shakespeare . 
  did n't their gdp dive after the annexation/incursions ? 
  i know it was n't great before , but this definitely made it worse . 
  make him work for his food . 
  the perfect plan . 
  he 'd become too fat to drag out without demolishing half the building first . 
  annoyingly the train companies are expensive * and * subsidised ... 
  well , the reason we get so many germans is because of [ rosamunde pilcher 's books ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosamunde_pilcher#tv_adaptation ) . 
  we need to get the french to make something like the germans have ... 
   arrive drunk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-4rzlo1vbm#t=6m40s at least our national shame has resulted in fairly addictive trashy tv ? 
  in a pub we 'll pay # 3 - # 4 for a pint ( around $ 4.50 ) , but you could get 4 + cans of lager from a supermarket for the for the same price . 
  you can get a litre of smirnoff for # 15 ( $ 19 ) ( special offer from tesco right now ) . 
  we never see you !, 
  so many german number plates on the roads here ( cornwall ) , but the french are incredibly rare . 
  nobody goes to the us for a piss-up lads lads lads holiday because if you 're just going to drink there are places closer to home and much cheaper . 
  the nicest place i 've ruined by getting horribly drunk was venice though ... 
  tampon usage frequency in the uk : http://www.statista.com/statistics/302806/tampon-usage-frequency-in-the-uk/ suggests that a fairly typical usage is 240 per year but with quite a large variation . 
  tampons are about # 4 for 40 on amazon , so that 's 10p per tampon or # 24 for a year 's supply . 
  tampons are taxed at the reduced rate of 5 % , so without the tax a year 's supply would be 24/1 .05 = # 22.86 . 
  apparently vat on tampons costs a woman around # 1.14 ( $ 1.46 ) per year . 
  though i guess this may vary between # 1 and # 2 . 
  i ca n't believe people give a fuck about this . 
  no updates on this . 
  presumably it 's all over ? 
  edit : well , apparently not . 
  not yet , anyway . 
  i honestly thought this story was satire the first few times i saw the headline . 
  she came across quite flustered there at times . 
  normally she 's very much in control . 
  young people still like him . 
  are we looking forward into ireland ( the sign suggests that to me ) ? 
  usually we 're the ones covered in clouds ... 
  it was embarrassing , but sadly a few news stories about running out of ammo were n't enough for anyone to do anything about it . 
  lower cost is from the [ government ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cost-of-libya-operations ) . 
  higher cost is from [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/sep/26/uk-operations-libya-costs ) . 
  my point really is that europe collectively spent more than the us did . 
  i know it 's a problem on our doorstep , so that 's probably the way it should be . 
  but to say we just freeloaded is stupid . 
  http://i.imgur.com/iup18us.png we still spent a hell of a lot on it . 
  obama can get fucked . 
  bit of a tight squeeze really : http://i.imgur.com/ttergyd.png, 
  i 'm 80 % sure the french tricked us into building that tunnel with them * precisely for this purpose * . 
  yeah , that worries me . 
  i hope that it 's remain , and i hope ukip shut up for at least a decade . 
  not much since obama came to power , that 's for sure . 
  this one 's actually nice though . 
  well , maybe not as nice as the rest of venice which is fucking lovely , but it 's at least interesting . 
  the roma gypsies we have over here are quite quiet . 
  i remember one , rather than speaking , handing me a laminated begging letter . 
  what 's weird is that their time is * ahead * of the uk . 
  surely being lazy spaniards , they 'd want to be a few hours behind ? 
  ^ ( just for the record , i love spain and spanish people . ), 
  \\  implying football players can speak good english, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6wu81bevbi this might be the same thing . 
  the best name still goes to [ hms pickle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_pickle_\\ ( 1800 \\ ) ) :  vice-admiral lord hugh seymour , the commander in chief on the jamaica station , formally purchased sting in december 1800 for # 2,500 , after having leased her for some time at # 10 per day . 
  his purchase was in defiance of orders not to purchase vessels . 
  however , faced with a fait accompli , the admiralty issued an order in february 1801 that her name be changed to pickle . 
  i was n't offended so you 're ok , 
  not too big , not too small . 
  it did . 
  for a while . 
  was n't quite invincible though - some amazing victories and some amazing defeats . 
  we are simply having a holiday from proper defence spending !, 
  i think we would probably stop accepting ships from calais . 
  i ca n't see this going at all well . 
  the talent is in the playing - i 'm not a piano player , but i 'm told the phasing is actually pretty tricky . 
  i 've always liked those remixes . 
  the easiest * pure * steve reich to listen to is music for 18 musicians : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxjwo2fq16c, 
  they like cities for the media coverage , plus they 're more likely to fit in and not look suspicious , but i agree that they could do a huge amount of a damage in an isolated rural area . 
  an attack during an annual festival at a small town would have thousands of people in attendance , but possibly no armed police within any reasonable distance . 
  i suppose in my area i 'd have to hope that the local naval base could provide support ... 
  well i guess we have ba and they 're ok . 
  but i 've not had cause to travel with them for years . 
  easyjet and flybe all the way . 
  yeah , i read this on my eu-funded fibre-optic broadband , ready to go to work tomorrow in my eu-funded office building at my job which i found using an eu-funded website . 
  my experience ca n't by typical , but europe has been good for cornwall . 
  i think i used to have 4gb of tethering , but they cut it presumably to persuade me to sign up to one of the new more expensive contracts . 
  i 'm still ( somehow ) on the all-you-can-eat plan for # 12.90 / month .
