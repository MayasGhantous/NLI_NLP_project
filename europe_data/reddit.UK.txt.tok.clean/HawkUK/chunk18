  in the last three months i 've used : 3.6 gb , 12.3 gb , 26.4 gb . 
  i 'd probably be fairly happy with 12gb to be fair . 
  the 26 + was an anomaly from when i was away from home , which i could easily avoid in future by using a bit more wifi . 
  i 'm assuming crete is fine ? 
  i do n't think so : http://indy100.independent.co.uk/image/18477-6rv6cn.jpg we 're better at being poor in cornwall . 
  gchq would find it just as hard to operate in portugal as the nsa . 
  to be honest , gchq and nsa are practically married . 
   a t0 has no bedroom and will be what is generally known as a studio apartment , with just a general space that serves as the living room , dining room , bedroom and sometimes even the kitchen . 
  t1 is a 1-bedroom apartment , t2 is a 2-bedroom apartment and so on . 
  a t1 +1 is more subjective , but will generally be a 1-bedroom apartment with another internal room that has no windows and at a pinch could be used as another bedroom . 
  eventually , but i think we should consolidate our present situation first . 
  i like it . 
  [ the raf regiment is rather more inclusive ! ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/liam-gadsby-court-martial-raf-5135513 ) . 
  taking people of all abilities . 
   despite his horrific injuries , johnson was initially reluctant to report the incident fearing army colleagues would ridicule the raf . 
   he believed the cock-up would make the raf look like `` twats '' because , in his own words , `` the army would love to hear we shot one of our own lads . '', 
  #the best i could find from the uk : ### royal navy [ submarines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi8dhdpxpwc ) , [ officer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwlidlrosii ) , [ kit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_bqjsu6-7o ) ### royal air force [ eurofighter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01dflgiqbra ) , [ explosions and shit ( 1997 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukhhx2gqz5a ) , [ you do n't have to be a pilot to fly in the raf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsuzvscociw ) ( but it helps ) ### british army [ slow-mo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sohvjbwuix4 ) , [ young woman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epwhbbg3wag ) , [ some sort of montage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfp-jqjb81u ) , [ normal days ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nif9jmnkniu ) ### misc [ reserves ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efywxxsmock ) love the submarine one - the cinematography is great . 
  also love how the eurofighter is created by stealing important equipment from hospitals . 
  normal days is well put together too . 
  ** if you watch just one of them , i 'd recommend the eurofighter **, 
  i like most of these , but i feel like i 'm watching starship troopers . 
  american adverts are all about honour and [ ours ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/470vt5/reurope_show_off_your_countrys_militaryspecial/d09cv24 ) are all about me me me me . 
  i generally just vote on the way home from work . 
  think they 're open until 10pm ( from 7am ) . 
  this time it falls during glastonbury , so i 'll need a postal vote ... 
   it makes sense to have two different jets does n't it ? 
  at * least * two . 
  do n't want all my eggs in one basket . 
  we should just say `` only if you want to get back together :3 '' . 
  if you give me $ 10 , i 'll vote out !, 
  so ... what will this actually mean ? 
  personally it would be slovenia , but only really because of its proximity to north-east italy where i was holidaying . 
  a couple of years ago i 'd have probably said slovakia . 
  thanks !, 
  not heard about that - got any articles on it ? 
  we generally just hear about retired people going to spain and thinking they own the place ... 
  nah , everyone 's used to the poles by now . 
  it 's those bloody bulgarians and romanians !, 
  ( actually i 'll concede that the roma are a bit of a problem , though most romanians distance themselves from them . ), 
  i think it 's viewed by many as the straw that will break the camel 's back . 
  i thought paris was decent , apart from all the fucking metro tickets littering the entire city . 
  a while since i was there though , so they may have an oyster equivalent by now . 
  overall , yeah . 
  but as far as transport infrastructure spending goes the north east is fucked , with just a fiver spent per head : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-16235349 #transport spending per head area | spending per head - | - london | # 2,731 south-east of england | # 792 east midlands | # 311 west midlands | # 269 yorkshire and humberside | # 201 north-west of england | # 134 eastern england | # 43 south-west of england | # 19 north-east of england | # 5 sadly the article i found is just for england , so not sure how it compares to scotland , but i imagine it 'd be somewhere in the middle . 
  we managed square in newcastle : http://i1.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article6899013.ece/alternates/s1200/haymarket-train-reduced-size.jpg shame about the tyne & wear metro musical though : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v80isj9jk1s, 
   eu becomes a single service market place i 've heard about this in passing - got any more info on it ? 
  i was meaning ` we ' as in the uk , once `` the workshop of the world '' . 
  i ca n't help but feel we dropped the ball over here ... 
  i think you 're right there . 
  bollocks . 
  i 'd probably say docudrama . 
  i think i 'd pick the scillies . 
  fairly isolated , plenty of fish , prevailing winds come from thousands of miles of ocean . 
  i * imagine * that they wo n't be carrying a warhead on-board . 
  ffs, 
   that 's 10 % of our gdp that 's pretty big - hopefully it will help hungary to grow its economy though and not need so much support in future . 
  i mean , that 's the plan ... 
  what are uk bonds going for at the moment ? 
  that 's the sort of world turkey has been working towards !, 
  i 'm impressed at the number of helicopters that were able to attend . 
  hopefully the speedy response will give the seriously injured a better chance . 
  they seem to be relatively quick . 
  i do n't trust them on a lot of topics , but i do n't know how they 'd spin a train crash ... 
  ahh , the graph is just western europe , so with the east , we 're still ahead but that trend does n't look great ... 
  i 'm told the fjords are nice . 
  and i 've liked all the norwegians i 've met :d . never thought about it as a holiday destination though , as i use those precious few weeks for sunshine , which i 've always assumed you do n't have . 
  / r/lewronggeneration, 
  well , we * used * to be * way * ahead : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/1_ad_to_2003_ad_historical_trends_in_global_distribution_of_gdp_china_india_western_europe_usa_middle_east.png, 
  some of us thought he did the right thing . 
  off the top of my head , the balance is now the other way around to the tune of # 7 billion * per year * . 
  as it is scotland faces some additional issues with job losses in the oil industry , but this has had no effect in government spending or borrowing because in the uk as a whole because oil is a proportionally smaller part of our economy - think we might be net consumers actually . 
  an independent scotland would be facing a very uncertain future with proportionally much higher cuts or tax rises than it does at present . 
  for an ( arguably fairly biased ) overview read this with a pinch of salt : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/12141257/imagine-the-mess-an-independent-scotland-would-be-in-right-now.html also worth a look at is some work by a unionist scottish blogger : http://chokkablog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/ffa-for-dummies-methodology.html?m=1, 
  i was n't being * entirely * serious . 
  ahh , but you managed to tame yours . 
  / r/wallstreetbets, 
  are you happy there ? 
  not that asking a random person on reddit is much of a benchmark of a nation 's situation . 
  i honestly think if extremists could just have a nice sit down and a cold pint ( or maybe an expensive cocktail ) they 'd be much more chilled out about things . 
  true : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/uk_eu_referendum_polling.svg/900px-uk_eu_referendum_polling.svg.png, 
  more seriously , this from top gear : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmcmqtau6b8, 
  the closest i think we have to this is the 2011 british airways advert : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xozhloqwp_4 it 's not explicitly about britain , but they are our flag carrier . 
  the 2013 one is n't bad either : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1m0pbxnuf8, 
  boris 's is much thicker , but give it a few years ... 
  i do n't care if you thought the [ london 2012 opening ceremony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6nbhx80ovy] ) was cheesy shite . 
  this bit was awesome . 
  about how we build the modern world or something . 
  if that man becomes prime minister ... 
  i 'm just annoyed you did n't beat the french . 
  so close yet so far . . 
  it 's not entirely correct - the constituent ` countries ' do not have sovereignty . 
  there was one of the danish pm ( i think ) with a swastika armband . 
  so can we strap a crew module to it ? 
  it 's ok , she wo n't be allowed to do anything without her man !, 
  french source here : http://lci.tf1.fr/france/faits-divers/info-tf1-un-homme-interpelle-a-disneyland-paris-avec-deux-armes-8710724.html a translation from a proper french speaker would be great , but we are told the following : - 28 year old man arrested - arrested passing through a security checkpoint - he had two automatic pistols ( with two magazines and twenty cartridges ... not sure how that works out , maybe the google translation is too far off ) . 
  - he has a partner that they 're still looking for . 
  ca n't tell if this just means a romantic partner , or another terrorist . 
  - he had a french language koran, 
  can confirm . 
  every single one of my friends is working on a zhc and when they go to the job centre plus they get beaten up .
