  i had no idea about that . 
  thought it was all finished in the 20s . 
  yes and no . 
  the coalition dumped our maritime patrol aircraft and got rid of the harriers and aircraft carriers . 
  these are all being replaced though . 
  they did however reduce the army which seems rather more permanent . 
  pre-2010 government is n't innocent either . 
  they * halved * the number of type 45 destroyers that would be built . 
  at least the harrier legacy lives on to a degree in the f-35 . 
  at least i 'm assuming there would n't have been a vtol version without ... 
  which we also have , and it seems to deliver packages straight to jihadi 's doors no problem !, 
  i think we decided just to upgrade the challenger 2 , and not build any more . 
  we 'd have to build a new tank assembly line and everything ... 
  i * think * they did in my experience , but i ca n't be sure if i 'm thinking about erasmus or international students in general ... 
  i wonder if we managed to settle on one , we could bring the cost of an mbt down low enough for ireland to feel like buying one ? 
  ahh , but apparently the incredibly high turnout and one-sidedness of the referendum is indicative of north korean style `` democracy '' , not an incredibly strong desire to not be ruled by invaders . 
  a country that annexed your island within living memory . 
  seamus is a tool . 
  it 's crazy . 
  if he just shut up about all foreign policy , he might actually have a chance ... 
  yeah , but i think that 's just a spouse/children/parents . 
  i was thinking more extended family - you may want to head to the same country as your cousins for example . 
  no idea how many immigrants have that as their reason , just putting it forward as one of many . 
  i would guess for a fair few it 's the english language , and for others it 's having friends/family already in the uk . 
  it definitely came up in conversations with friends who said it was really fun to watch during the olympics . 
  do n't think it really moved to the mainstream though !, 
  on the other hand , leaving might encourage germany to pull its weight on defence . 
  [ a hundred kids and an ex offender on an island full of cameras . 
  what 's going to happen !? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pko2_ldgsas#t=45s ), 
  stops it sliding off , until the roof collapses under the metres of ice ? 
  which plan gets rid of the sbas ? 
  thought it was just ceding some unused territory . 
  and as for tv satire , see brasseye ... 
  i did n't see those . 
  christ . 
  youtube stream here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7r2r-bmj1y oh god . 
  do n't open five at once . 
  my ears !, 
  ** edit : ** how many reporters are there ? 
  so many professional-looking cameras . 
  it is 12 months . 
  i just looked at an [ old bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31515556 ) which said ~ 600k and i just rounded down to a half million , which i guess is probably about right now that unemployment is decreasing . 
  i think long-term unemployment is of the order of a half-million . 
  hard to say how many are just out of laziness though ... 
  well , they seem more significant . 
  you have around 2.69 million citizens in these territories , but in ours there are only 0.35 million . 
  to be fair , the remains of the french empire are a bit larger . 
   one in which our culture and language was deliberately curtailed , a past in which the famine of 1845 caused the deaths of nearly 1.5 million innocent people and i know for a fact that some of my ancestors were emigrants from ireland during the famine . 
  still think the empire was kind of impressive , if more for naval supremacy and engineering . 
  i ca n't really remember anything to do with the empire apart from the us and australia . 
  do n't remember india getting a mention , but we did cover the slave trade to the americas . 
  i suppose it * may * have been discussed in the context of the industrial revolution and trade in the empire , but i think we mostly looked at the inventions . 
  well , just because there has n't been one in a while , does n't mean there wo n't be one in the future . 
  make it happen !, 
  just not over here ... 
  i feel quite aggrieved that i did n't see anything like op 's pic when i was there . 
  agreed . 
  top two are great . 
  bottom two should be razed to the ground . 
  have you been to sheffield yet ? 
  if i had to choose somewhere in the midlands it 's certainly one of the best options . 
  he 's basically a lifelong cnd member and britain 's oldest sixth former . 
  i think they 're just as `` correct '' as the current versions . 
  there 's never going to be a 1:1 mapping of sounds from one language to another . 
  personally i think the old ones sounds better in this case and i 'd rather we kept using them , like we say germany not deutschland . 
  i 'd like to see some sort of graphic showing how often we tip the balance . 
  instructions unclear : arrested at gunpoint . 
  going through his history it can easily be seen that he 's a troll . 
  bet he complains about ksa funding terrorism though . 
  they were proper good old fashioned * british * terrorists . 
  this had better not be some dastardly french scheme \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  reminds me of something from the day today : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nniec-k3at0, 
  now that he is . 
  if you did n't know , he 's been on our # 10 note for as long as i can remember : https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/23/c3/a1/23c3a195947f52cc07ef05cb7865c935.jpg ^ ( ca n't imagine americans ever doing similar ... ), 
  no , not a majority , but still the largest party . 
  i 'm not sure if it says more about the british public , or ukip . 
  our last of inventions and discoveries is really quite impressive , at least in the past : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_british_innovations_and_discoveries plenty of really interesting ones under romania though , especially considering that i 'm looking at the english language version : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_romanian_inventors_and_discoverers, 
  they 're traveling far too much to be gypsies ... 
  surprisingly , by value , when it comes to cars we actually export more than we import . 
  the `` joint new air-to-air missile '' sounds interesting . 
  as they say meteor , i guess it 's one that 's modified to fit properly in an f35 . 
  * perfidiousness intensifies *, 
  that pic is creepy . 
  like he 's been killed by the robot . 
  personally i do put them in the fridge , straight from the chicken pretty much . 
  actually we have only * one * remaining chicken ... so they do have the be supplemented with some from the supermarket , which also go in the fridge ... 
  as a full-size city , [ bristol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bristol ) is definitely underrated . 
  they 're not real people !, 
  ^ ( ^ disclaimer , ^ i ^ do ^ actually ^ have ^ teetotal ^ friends , ^ but ^ that ^ does n't ^ stop ^ me ^ making ^ fun ^ of ^ them . ), 
  apparently we drink less than 3 pints a week ? 
  we still have the pitcairn islands ... 
  guidance can be done using the stars . 
  gps is optional . 
  you 're right that it 's possible , but i believe people in europe are too reluctant to spend money on defence . 
  we barely make 2 % in the uk , but we still have people shouting `` bairns not bombs '' etc. 
  there 's no appetite for defence spending . 
  we sort of gave up : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_space_programme#british_space_vehicles_.281950.e2.80.931985.29 if we * really wanted to * i guess we could . 
  but it would take time to build up that capability and at a guess could take almost a decade . 
  israel is much closer to the equator than the uk which makes launching satellite much more efficient .
