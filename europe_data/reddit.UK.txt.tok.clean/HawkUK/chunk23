  easily confirmable by looking at google maps  . 
  they 're * called * countries , but this is really just a linguistic quirk and honestly not worth worrying about . 
  the acts of union 1707 stated that :  that the two kingdoms of scotland and england , shall upon the 1st may next ensuing the date hereof , and forever after , be united into ** one kingdom ** by the name of great britain emphasis mine . 
  two kingdoms become one . 
  * not * two kingdoms hold some sort of loose arrangement with one another . 
  about as prepared as the eu is to lose the uk . 
  likewise has been said about paris in he context of brexit . 
  germany and usa dominate our foreign politics , but i 'd say france might be third . 
  they got those exceptions while full-members . 
  we did not get those exceptions as full-members . 
  is there a good summary of this ? 
  it does make me quite angry , so i 'm looking for something balanced ( i.e. 
  not daily mail ) . 
  yup . 
  this sort of language is going to push those who wanted soft-brexit towards wanting hard-brexit . 
  with friends like these , who needs enemies ? 
  rosetta was fine . 
  mars is hard . 
   they pay other states in the eea for the purpose of lessening ` economic and social disparites ' . 
  i assume this is what 's going to happen if uk decides to stay in the single market . 
  iceland , liechtenstein and norway ? 
  i do n't * think * they need that much help ... 
  it 's natwest though . 
  does it have a good image to lose ? 
  i 'm only still with them because of the get cash feature . 
  in gdp terms we 're doing fine . 
  in cost of living and housing in particular ... not so well . 
  i 'm not really sure why i 'm being downvoted . 
  a lot of people just go about their daily lives without especially searching for political news and in my area it looked as if remain was a * fringe view * . 
  leave appeared to many as the obvious choice . 
  cornwall , mostly , which may explain things . 
  remain really were n't visible on the ground . 
  leave had posters and signs all over the place . 
  if a '' * good * '' deal is struck , then scotland has nothing to gain by leaving , but i do n't see it happening . . 
  identity is like a series of russian dolls . 
  you can be english , british and european . 
  it 's not as if scotland is entirely homogeneous either , is it . 
  the uk is a nation . 
  it could change , but right now it is a nation . 
  maybe one day europe will be a nation . 
  who knows !, 
  and that will continue providing some idiots do n't manage put up significant trade barriers . 
  scotland is free to trade with the eu and with the rest of the uk right now . 
  suddenly having a trade barrier with ruk would not automatically boost exports to the eu that it 's already able to trade with . 
  do europeans exist ? 
  they 're * called * countries . 
  if it helps , consider them to be similar to us states ( but actually more closely integrated ) . 
  if the uk drops down to wto rules , then scexit followed by scentrance would be disastrous for scotland , where the rest of the uk is the main trading partner . 
  i agree with you , but adding new eu laws post-brexit will not be popular . 
  it 's mixed . 
  great for my work personally as we 're now much cheaper on the international market . 
   a pretty fringe aim to tear up eu law and the ecj i 'm not sure . 
  eu law is already hated by many , and i 'm sure those numbers will grow when we actually have zero say in it . 
  it 's certainly correlated , but it 's not the be all and end all . 
  if you believe that negotiations take less than two years , agreeing to discussion before article-50 activation . 
  yup , that 's my experience . 
  may have noticed it more if oil was n't still half its peak . 
  prices have n't really changed for us internally tbh . 
  pension funds will actually be looking * better * for us , as they 'll hold assets in pounds ( which still look the same to us ) , with a lot in equities which have gone up ( at least in the ftse 100 ) and foreign currencies which will also have risen . 
  that 's just a way to ensure we stay out . 
  there is not `` eu jobs market '' in roi as such . 
  there is an * irish * job market to which anyone the irish government wishes to grant access to can work in . 
  at the moment any irish national , eu national ** or ** british national can work in ireland . 
  if roi decides to delete the cta then fair enough , what you say would come true , but i do n't think it will be popular . 
  uk nationals had a right to work in roi * before * the eu existed . 
  the cta provides for this and the eu does n't have some sort of weird exclusivity clause . 
  ireland and the uk can allow whoever they wish to work in their respective countries . 
  eu freedom of movement does n't mean that * only * eu nationals can work in a member state . 
  all those lucky northern irish who get to live in the uk and not pay into the eu , but get free eu membership !, 
   uk passport holders wo n't be able to enter the republic eu job market . 
  doubt the right to work will be abolished . 
  it 's possible , but probably an unpopular move on both sides . 
  ^ ( and irish travellers will still be free to come and wreck british ferry terminals and steal lead from our roofs . ), 
  ^ ( ^ we ^ are ^ doing ^ lazy ^ stereotypes , ^ right ? ), 
  how 's it dirty work ? 
  are the eu 's external borders also `` dirty work '' ? 
  as / u/unskialz says , it 's about * keeping * the cta . 
  it 's called a compromise . 
  it 's already like that though . 
  ireland is not in schengen . 
  they do n't always hire locally , you know : https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/10/sandwich-firm-fill-vacancies-factory-east-european-workers, 
  they 'll be criticised for not hiring locally if the jobs are unskilled or if there is a surplus of unemployed qualified locals . 
  i do n't see that as a problem . 
  if you do have a problem with it , why do n't you campaign for completely open borders with the rest of the world ? 
  same thing , just a different scale . 
  context ? 
  you 're right that it 's been misreported - the headlines make it sound like they 're actually going to publish the names and addresses of foreign nationals working in the uk , rather than what they 're actually going to do : publish some statistics . 
  what do you think will happen ? 
  sports direct and others of that ilk will be criticised for only employing 20 % of their workers locally . 
  anything else is an hysteria . 
  you should give your own people a little more credit than that . 
  just so you know , i 'm not actually * that * fussed either way whether these figures are collected or not , though at * worst * they 'll be * interesting * and at best they 'll help us tackle * unemployment and job security * . 
   so why the need to name and shame the companies that are working under the current system . . what possible benefit will this entail even to the british people by naming and shaming these companies ? 
  statistics are always useful . 
  i expect it * might * reveal where areas of high-unemployment that intersect with areas with a high proportion of businesses hiring low-skilled employees almost exclusively from eastern europe at the expense of the unemployed low-skilled local population . 
  we 're talking warehouse workers , hotel cleaning staff , fruit pickers etc. 
  couple of examples : [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/10/sandwich-firm-fill-vacancies-factory-east-european-workers ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/what-working-undercover-factory-taught-me-about-eu-migration-1561735 )  do you honestly feel that by firing a non-citizen to hire a citizen in his place to get their proportions right the companies or the british citizen would be better off ? 
  i think that post-brexit at the bottom end of the market this would be sensible . 
  we 're not talking about lawyers , doctors , computer programmers where having more is always good . 
  we 're talking about human machines , doing low-skilled repetitive manual labour .
