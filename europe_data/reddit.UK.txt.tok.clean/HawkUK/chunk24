  if we turn off the cheap-labour tap , businesses will be forced to hire locally and offer more secure employment . 
  i 'm not * actually * convinced collecting the data will make that much difference , but i do n't see the harm if we 're going to be leaving the eea anyway . 
   what atmosphere will it create in the companies and in uk industry in general ? 
  i do n't think it will make much difference , except at shitty warehouses . 
  most companies obviously * mostly * employ locals . 
  those that do n't are already in the shitter pr wise . 
   is the current uk government as desperate to consolidate their position so as to propose outright insensible populist laws ? 
  i do n't think it 's that ridiculous . 
  hell , most countries in the eu actually * demand * that you go and register as a foreigner if you choose to move there - you know , taking down all your details . 
  much more invasive than some basic workforce statistics . 
   and ironically the current uk opposition is one of the weakest probably in generations ... so why the hurry and desperation i do n't see hurry and desperation . 
  i see a government eager to make its mark like all governments are keen to do . 
  a legacy , if you will . 
  yeah - it 'll probably be mediocre at best , but that 's true of all governments . 
  it 's ridiculous that you 've been downvoted for this . 
  furthermore when scotland and england became one country it was known as the ** kingdom of britain ** . 
  the *** united *** ** kingdom ** ( of great britain and ireland ) only came into existence after ireland joined . 
  yeah , this is happening all over the place at the lower end of the job market . 
  but / r/unitedkingdom and / r/europe just brush it under the carpet and pretend it never happens . 
  the more middle-class members of society have n't noticed it except for when they get served as costa or bump into the hotel cleaning staff . 
  the poorer working classes are the ones facing the stiffest competition . 
  just fyi cornwall does have a problem with wealthy londoners buying up second homes down here . 
  banning londoners from moving here would probably be supported by a significant proportion of cornish residents . 
  if you look at the poll you will see that a majority of scots support the measures . 
  they did and sturgeon is free to make it known that her particular region made it clear that they wanted to remain in the eu . 
  however they also voted to remain part of the uk and the opinion polls have * not shifted * over brexit . 
  she 's not doing a great job of representing them then !, 
  that 's what i clarified . 
  she certainly ca n't complain about it being against the will of scotland . 
  what are you so worried about ? 
  are you afraid that the data collected will show the public just how badly some areas and industries are affected by migration ? 
  surely if migration is no problem , this data will show just how low it is ? 
  she 's possibly quite cunning . 
  a bit of a left-wing farage from a unionist perspective . 
  it 's what half her voters want . 
  snp voters are 50/50 split on collecting this data . 
  this is her own personal crusade and not one her voters have asked her to carry out . 
  the scottish population as a whole are * in favour * of collecting this data and she represents all of them , not just snp voters . 
  she 's doing the opposite of what scottish people want is what i should have said . 
  she 's doing the opposite of what her voters want though !, 
  i do n't care much either way on the collection of these statistics ( companies already collect information on the race of applicants etc ) . 
  but surely if there is no problem with migration , then these statistics will help prove that ? 
  ahh i love the / r/europe groupthink . 
  negotiations have n't begun , but you can bet that all parties are putting plans and resources together . 
  as are northern ireland republicans . 
  generally best to steer clear of political discussion if you 're there . 
  edit : ahh yeah , the traditional / r/europe downvotes against balance . 
  nice . 
  the rebate was to * correct * the imbalance caused by the common agricultural policy . 
  with the rebate in place our net-contribution per person is actually almost exactly the same as france . 
  so while we had a deal with the eu , i do n't think it was necessarily ` the best ' deal and certainly no more or less fair than the deal france has . 
  we all have national insurance numbers , but that 's national rather than local . 
  we have an electoral roll which is managed at a more local level , but that 's not compulsory . 
  yup . 
  * historic country * or * region * would be fine . 
  my own county has similar delusions about being an actual country , but thankfully they 're not too widespread . 
  i think we fucked up by continuing to call e/s/w / ni countries . 
  paul monaghan is probably the thickest mp i have ever encountered . 
  the guy is a proper idiot : https://twitter.com/_paulmonaghan/status/708433071603843073, 
  if we 're going to spend that much effort on reporting , we may as well do a breakdown by wage bracket . 
  northern ireland will want to start as it is . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  i voted remain anyway , though it 's seeming increasingly toxic . 
  same with london . 
  fuck off with trying to cause problems everywhere my, 
  please try to remember how close this vote was, 
  well it 's fairly key . 
  nah , roughly equal . 
  english and welsh . 
  then we 'd literally close the border at that location . 
  no more ships from calais . 
  lol , i believe it was sf who tried to create an issue . 
  as usual . 
  of course . 
  international relations are always best conducted with spite . 
  this . 
  or that might just be the hangover . 
  worried and powerless . 
  i feel like i 've just been strapped into a ride and it might be quite rough ... 
  planting a tree , or is it the egg from a godzilla ? 
  with all their trade with the rest of the uk it would probably be a worse idea than brexit . 
  i think most people were up late enough to hear the news before they slept . 
  i 'm kind of glad i was awake through the night and had it slowly dawn on me , rather than an awful shock in the morning . 
  well they 're calling today 's result a huge majority , so that must be massive . 
  decent airport . 
  reasonable sized city . 
  admittedly i 'd expect to see manchester or birmingham before it ... 
  ** all ** our mps are all conservatives at the moment , which is certainly not typical for cornwall . 
  the calculated scottish deficit already takes into account the higher tax take up there . 
  turns out that there might be more tax collected in scotland , but there 's * even more * tax spent there that more than outweighs it . 
  this has been discussed many times , and the consensus is that it will stay as it is , because it looks fucking awesome just as it is . 
  https://twitter.com/meaglemp/status/743435068849463296?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw i was expecting a takbir , so this is a refreshing change . 
  honestly our security services . 
  they 're top notch . 
  we have a lot of poles working in hotels and loads of lithuanians working on farms . 
  i do n't have any numbers , but it 's certainly noticeable . 
  it 's interesting . 
  i have part eu-funded fibre broadband . 
  studied at a sixth form college which was able to expand with eu funds . 
  got my first proper job on an eu-funded website .
