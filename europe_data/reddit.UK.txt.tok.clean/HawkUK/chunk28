  haha !, 
  there will be one though , and still within a decade of the last i reckon . 
  though of course having a referendum goes against the / r/europe groupthink against referendums . 
   you will have pay what you have agreed to . 
  maybe not the full bill , but there will be a payment . 
  want to bet ? 
  i expect there will be a small payment for pensions , but probably not much else . 
  nothing anywhere near the amount quoted . 
   oh , do n't give me that crap . 
  the uk knew the conditions beforehand . 
  basically the whole world warned you ( except for russia maybe , which says a lot about brexit ) , but you decided it was worth it . 
  now you seem to be disappointed that all the bullshit you were fed by your parliamentary clowns will not happen . 
  saying `` it 's better inside than out '' ( which may be true ) is very different than actively trying to make it so . 
   the uk has no weight it does , which is why we 'll be fine in the long term . 
   the eu will protect its interests . 
  its remarkably * imperial * interests  and it will make it transparent , to make sure you guys are treated fair . 
  with that $ 60bn ` bill ' ? 
  * acting like they said they would * does not mean * acting in a fair and balanced way * . 
  warning someone that you 'll do something if they proceed with a particular course of action does not abdicate if of moral responsibility . 
   i sure hope if that would ever happen , there will be a eu wide referendum beforehand so we can decide wether to give you another chance or not . 
  right now , thanks , but no thanks . 
  glad the feeling is mutual . 
  every day it seems that farage got more and more right , despite being a massive cunt . 
  to make an example of us . 
  i get it - it 's politically beneficial for the eu , but if we really are made an example of it does mean that i 'd never want to be part of the eu ever again . 
  because the eu appears to be making a distinction and treating third countries on its doorstep ( as the uk now is ) worse than third countries further afield . 
  the real reason for this so-called transparency is political . 
  i say so-called , because there will clearly be some discussions not made public . 
  indeed - i said * outside of europe * . 
  i 'll be interested to see how you 'll react when the next trade deal the eu starts outside of europe is also rather secretive . 
  are you actually asserting that it was the uk who made ttip secret ? 
  i thought norway did n't want to let us in ? 
  it seems the most sensible option , but the ridiculous bill is going to be a huge roadblock . 
   this is the opposite of the british approach it 's the opposite of the eu 's usual approach , when you look at ttip for example . 
  i 'm pretty sure our motto has become keep calm and carry on, 
  good theory . 
  reading reddit comments on / r/europe makes brexit feel like a good idea . 
  there are stories about benefits and taxes all the time . 
  this story was seen as different and interesting ... and good for sales . 
  perhaps post-brexit we should enlarge uk waters to cover the entirety of the spanish north coast ? 
  you 'll still be able to veto it , presumably . 
  but it 's going to be interesting watching other countries become the * bad guys * blocking european integration once we 've left . 
  particular ireland , which is seen as some sort of saint on here . 
  might be - not an expert , just picked the top three in my mind . 
  the `` double irish with a dutch sandwich '' is well known and luxembourg is luxembourg ... 
  the overseas territories are not part of the eu with the exception of gibraltar . 
  i will expect a tougher stance on ireland , the netherlands , and luxembourg after we leave . 
  like your country . 
  i 'm not sure our banks have * that much * to do with trains . 
  hell , half are run incompetently by eu companies . 
  in fairness the us has * both * while we have fom but only fairly minor fiscal transfers . 
  why is the former seen by the eu as less flexible than the latter ? 
  which is why i 'm surprised you have n't been supporting us in arguing for restrictions on fom . 
   i 'm just saying what is really the big loss for the uk if they give up gibraltar ? 
  economically , no . 
  strategically / militarily , yes . 
  regardless , the actual ** people who live there want to stay british ** . 
   you are already probably losing scotland and n ireland anyways . 
  you 've been drinking too much of the / r/europe propaganda juice . 
  if either goes , it 'll be their loss . 
  the usa itself was acquired itself by the conquest and subjugation of the native population . 
  give it back . 
  the us should give up alaska . 
  its a holdover from an era of imperialism and if russia wants to fight for it than i do n't see how it concerns anyone else . 
  maybe the eu should sort out its own internal tax havens before it starts looking outside . 
  it 's confusing to see people describing us as influential in the eu , when we 're told how pathetic and insignificant we 'll be outside of it . 
  personally makes me want to power through with brexit and prove them wrong . 
  to me it 's never felt that we have much influence in the eu , but maybe that 's how most countries feel . 
  unionist scots , surprise surprise , spend more of their time on / r/unitedkingdom . 
  while we 're in the eu an eu army * is * concerning us . 
  how am i wrong ? 
  your country uses its veto in the eu more than the uk does . 
  get it into your thick skull . 
  you are . 
  let 's revisit your original comment :  yep , but we 're not dicks about it . 
  we always let the other countries progress . 
  we do not veto things . 
  you ** do ** veto things , as i 've shown . 
  more than the uk in fact . 
  care to correct your original comment ? 
  you present the uk as some sort of malevolent force that is at odds with every reasonable country . 
  this is not the case at all . 
  moved them ? 
  the goalposts are just where i left them 3 comments ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6266bb/this_is_the_full_text_of_the_uk_governments/dfkqkbv/ anyway , having looked more closely , it appears that your precious denmark was * also * one of the countries that opposed raising eu tariffs on steel :  still , it remains unclear whether a compromise can be brokered in coming weeks . 
  a majority of member states wants to overhaul the regime but a blocking minority -- including the uk , sweden , the netherlands , finland and denmark -- has held out against change . 
  from the article * brussels moves to strengthen china steel tariffs * in the financial times , 8th november 2016 . 
  please take your ill-informed xenophobic uk bashing elsewhere . 
  as / u/eeeking said , this kind of ended up being off-topic , but it was also a fascinating read . 
  thanks !, 
  i 've still not seen examples where the uk was the * only * veto . 
  you seem to have ignored that what you hate the uk for , denmark is doing just the same or worse !, 
  mate , we 're * in * / r/europe . 
  the steel dumping that / u/nerkuras mentioned is true , but we did n't act alone and we 're rarely only nation to against raising tariffs . 
  you may also want to take a look at this : https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/gtdw_e/wkshop11_e/nordstrom_e.pdf#page=18 appears that denmark is more `` upset '' than the uk , as you put it . 
  might be distorted by the group i as with , which includes literal communists . 
  glasto stopped a lot of lexiters voting as well . 
  i was there but voted remain by postal vote . 
  thanks - know nothing about lloyds really , other than that it 's a cool building to take pictures of . 
  it 's a very big building to employ only 600 ... 
  any sources ?
