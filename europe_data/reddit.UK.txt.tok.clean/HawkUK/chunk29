  i suspect we were n't the only objector in most cases . 
  what have we vetoed that you 're upset about ? 
  we 've handed in our notice ( two years ) , but our current boss is saying that we 're not allowed to look for new jobs until we 've actually finished our last day . 
  denmark is fairly eurosceptic with a number of opt-outs . 
  a fair deal would be fairly low tariffs with no fom . 
  there 's no actual need for a free trade area to have fom , it 's just been a political decision . 
  like that would stop gchq . 
   it 's like quitting your job without having secured a new one so like the eu is trying to force the uk to operate when it comes to trade deals ? 
  try debunking this : https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/ also `` cheap work force '' ? 
  but / r/europe tells me that there 's no downwards pressure on wages due to migration . 
  italics are screaming now , are they ? 
  foreign aid , optional , is nothing to do with the eu budget , which is compulsory . 
  https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/ now get educated . 
  careful , your inner imperialist is showing !, 
  a couple of my colleagues have joined us from the netherlands in the past few months  . 
  china wo n't fuck over the uk in trade deals - we would n't accept a bad deal . 
  what we might be able to do is use our specialised economy to create better deals than we would with the eu . 
  we can offer zero import duty on products that are made in the eu but not in the uk . 
  if the eu offers no benefits other than `` not punishing members '' , then it does n't deserve to exist . 
  powers should never have been devolved at all . 
  the uk should be a unitary sovereign state . 
  tuition fees in england . 
  you do realise that scottish mps sit in westminster , so have just as much power as anyone else in the uk . 
  only if they 're concluded in * under * two years , which is optimistic . 
  it would also have been before brexit actually happened and the effects could be seen . 
  it was during some of the oil boom , but a net drain either side of that , including right now . 
  ni gets a vastly larger subsidy from the uk again . 
  ** vastly ** . 
  around # 10bn a year . 
  you could argue that it 's badly spent , but the assembly has a say over that . 
  i rather think your hate of the uk is clouding your judgement . 
  the eu chucks a token few million at deprived areas , from a budget to which the uk is a massive net contributor . 
  the uk chucks a few ** billion ** at scotland . 
  it 's just there to balance out the guardian, 
  maybe she can just scan and email it ? 
  well at least now we can get on with it . 
  hopefully we can come to a reasonable arrangement as quickly as possible . 
  there are a lot of parallels , thought he uk is a significant * net contributor * to the eu . 
  our banks did that and they 'll be dealt with according to the law . 
  i think you underestimate just how serious embargoes are . 
  they are a nuclear option . 
  kek . 
  you have loss aversion . 
  both staying and leaving are gambles in their own rights . 
  i voted remain because i thought the odds were better , but it 's still a gamble that the eu will be good for us over the long run . 
  many older people think they 've done young people a huge favour with brexit . 
  huge numbers voted * to help * their grandchildren , not to spite them . 
  we 'll have to see how it plays out to know whether they were right or not . 
  that 's a ratio of seeders/peers , not number of peers . 
  5.8 seeds per peer where it 's using a decimal point rather than decimal comma . 
  would have expected a higher speed , but those peers are probably closer to other seeders , for many even on the same servers if people are running seedboxes . 
  probably a private tracker . 
  we have some amazing architects , but our houses have looked like absolute shit for the last half century . 
  i wonder how much the emissions scandal has hit eu reputation ? 
  alex salmond then !, 
  i understand the feeling - nicola sturgeon does the same to us !, 
  christ you 're petty . 
  from now on i demand that the european union change its name because we are leaving !, 
  only focused ? 
  please . 
  because they 're literally right next to each other . 
  it makes just as much sense as calling europe `` europe '' . 
  the situation you describe is not the reverse . 
  the irish can call the british isles whatever they like - that 's their right - and it 's not going to bother me . 
  saying `` the british and irish isles '' instead is needlessly long and could cause offence to other people !, 
  no reasonable irish person i 've come across has a problem . 
  it 's just shrill anti-british nationalists who are n't worth the time of day . 
  kinda like british nationalists who say we are n't in europe !, 
  they are wrong to be offended  . 
  i will not be dictated to by snowflakes  . 
  hell , even calling a teddy bear `` mohammed '' causes offence in some people . 
  by the following :  ireland is remembering a man . 
  i took it to mean that ireland should downplay his terrorist activities . 
  it causes offence to people who do n't understand that it 's a geographic term . 
  i 'm not really that bothered . 
  far more offensive things get said on here in every thread . 
  the ussr was a political term and not a geographic term . 
  i shall continue to call the british isles the british isles . 
  it is never justified to blow up a random street of innocent people . 
  honestly they can get fucked , just like isis . 
  attack political figures and the military ? 
  sometimes , but i would n't describe that as terrorism . 
  blowing up the general public like the ira often did ? 
  terrorism is ** never ** justified . 
  the man was a terrorist . 
  same at airports . 
  it feels more dangerous in some ways , as someone could potentially whack one over the head with a fire extinguisher and get a free gun , inside departures . 
  true , but i suspect that very few states really wanted to set the terms in stone , knowing that they too may have to leave eventually . 
  not one that i knew actually , so thanks for teaching a native speaker a new word . 
  it 's about half a decade of contributions . 
  it 's insane . 
  then there will be no deal !, 
  we are members of the eu , but not an integral part - this is why it 's a different to `` independence '' . 
  regardless , the amount the eu are looking to extract looks * ridiculous * . 
  paying pensions of our old meps , fair enough . 
  plenty of other charges could be just , but definitely not the # 50bn figure . 
  it 's a calculated figure , some justified , most not . 
  we will pay what is legally required of us . 
  it 's not our fault the eu never bothered to properly flesh out the terms of exit in the treaties . 
  we agreed with the eu budget .
