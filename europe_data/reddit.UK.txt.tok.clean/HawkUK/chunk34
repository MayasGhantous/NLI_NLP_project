  it 's a comparison , not a joke . 
  i 'm comparing ireland being pushed around by the british empire to how you want the eu to push around the uk and bend it to its will . 
  of course they are n't identical situations at all , but both are very imperial ideas and you ca n't brush that aside and pretend otherwise . 
  as for the sovereignty returned , it would obviously include immigration policy which is the big one for many people , but also business regulations that are n't suited to our country . 
  i 'm actually broadly happy with most eu legislation that i 'm aware of , though the cookie law and the restrictions on toaster power can get fucked . 
  you 're going to have to take my word that i voted remain , though my post history before the referendum should corroborate . 
  i 'm a fairly risk averse person , but the financial risks of leaving the eu appear to have been overstated and the political tensions within the eu are more apparent than ever . 
  i 'm actually starting to feel that the less risky option in the long run is to get out before it all goes tits up . 
  i simply do n't feel that we belong in the eu anymore and that the benefits are overstated to begin with . 
  we do n't share the same goals as the rest of you who want ever closer union ( good luck with that ) , so it makes sense for us to head for the exit before we become too entwined . 
   your bigotry and self deception is pretty gross . 
  you obviously wish to subjugate the irish again and enjoy joking about it . 
  where ? 
  i 'm making you confront the fact that you 've become precisely what you claim to hate so much . 
  an imperialist . 
   no wonder you were suckered in with the phoney promise of `` sovereignty '' to vote to impose a border where we were previously in a system that ended borders around the continent . 
  your bigotry rather explains that . 
  sovereignty is something that is diminished when you become part of the eu . 
  its no phony promise to say that we 're bringing it closer to home . 
   it also explains the lack of success in putting brexit in brussels lap instead of you , who voted for it . 
  i did not vote leave . 
  i voted remain , but having seen the increasingly optimistic forecasts and the behaviour of eu officials and eu member state officials i am now leaning towards leave . 
  you seem to be so violently against our democratic decision to leave a faltering political union that * yes * , i do believe you think we should be forced to remain . 
  it is quite true that there is a difference between the two scenarios , but in a situation where it is the eu enforcing a border between our two countries against the wishes of their respective populations i would say the eu is drifting in the direction of the empire of old and the comparison will be more apt . 
  let us wait and see !, 
  your england-hate is showing again . 
  it was the british empire that ireland left , not the england . 
  posted by `` lord corbyn '' . 
  kinda makes sense . 
  it does seem rather like you wish the eu was compulsory . 
  as a country we decided was costing more than it was worth financially and in relinquishing control . 
  as i 've pointed out to you a thousand times , we did not vote for a border . 
  our two governments will be working together to ensure the best possible outcome . 
  if a hard border is enforced it will be because of the eu overriding the wishes of the irish . 
  saying that the uk ** must ** be in the eu for there to be an open border is equivalent to saying the roi must be in the uk for there to be an open border . 
  i imagine you might find the second idea a tad offensive , but that 's what you 're saying to the british . 
  no , not for brexit , but for the very existence of the border . 
  you do n't get a vote on another country 's independence referendum . 
  that 's just how it works , sorry . 
  but if it did , maybe we 'll bring back the old uk with the whole of ireland ? 
  equally ridiculous . 
  simple reality is that there will not be a hard border unless the eu forces one on ireland against ireland 's wishes . 
  by the same logic this is all irexit 's fault a century ago . 
  the fact is that our two countries are happy to have no border , so any border would be the result of eu meddling . 
  nope . 
  we have voted to leave the eu . 
  ** if ** the eu tries to force a hard border , which can only be for customs purposes at most , it will not end well for roi-eu relations . 
  nah , my country and yours have both said we should n't have a border . 
  if there is any objection it will come from other countries via the eu . 
  you 're welcome to leave the eu if you do n't like the border wall ( which i still think is unlikely to happen anyway ) . 
  i considered the trade of sovereignty to be on balance worth it . 
  if ireland was a truly sovereign nation , then it could do with the border as it pleased . 
  ( it pretty much can , which is why there 's no issue ) . 
  ireland does not dictate what international unions we should remain part of . 
  likewise with the uk - you can remain part of the eu even if it forces a customs border . 
  that is your choice to make . 
  then you accept being overruled on local issues . 
  i did n't vote for brexit , but bringing democracy closer to home is a legitimate reason to vote . 
  no , the eu would be imposing it . 
  this is not up for debate . 
  no party c ? 
  cool , you 've relinquished sovereignty entirely . 
  i did n't realise the eu was now a federal state !, 
  it * will * be the eu 's fault if it imposes a hard border that neither country wants . 
  it 's possible , but if brexit works well there 'll be no need to return and if brexit goes poorly then there 'll be too much animosity for us to rejoin for a number of decades . 
  providing we keep the rebate ( or cap reform happens ) then maybe . 
  i think we 're all hoping that 's just a phase . 
  that sounds like a reasonable model . 
  the cta can operate as a mini-schengen . 
  there will be a customs border , but very unlikely there would be passport checks . 
  this customs border could even be sporadic checks only !, 
  but since the uk and ireland do n't want a hard border , only the eu can make one happen . 
  yeah . 
  i 've been looking at it . 
  i see nothing about writing ireland a blank cheque . 
  they got self-determination , just like you did  . 
  another eu imperialist !, 
  i * think * he 's making shit up . 
  i 'm looking at the text of the agreement and ca n't find anything . 
  happy to be pointed in the right direction if i 've missed something though . 
  the two you 've linked me to are ** news website polls ** . 
  about as credible as that poll in the express with 90 + % wanting to leave the eu . 
  i would be interested in seeing some real polls ( cso and eurostat if you could link them would be great ) . 
  i 'll leave you with one from august : https://www.ipsos-mori.com/assets/docs/polls/ipsos-mori-northern-ireland-border-poll-2016-tables.pdf this is a proper poll and shows 63 % voting remain , 22 % voting to join roi , 13 % do n't know and 2 % would n't vote . 
  who would require us to do * anything * ? 
  which treaties ? 
  that would be a first . 
  link us please !, 
  yes, 
  they have now , but i guess quite some time after . 
  the link is that people in the republic of ireland generally are n't too keen on the partition of ireland . 
  if you 're happy with it then i can understand why you 'd be happy with a partition of the uk  . 
   yes voters to which would be turkeys ? 
  the only referendum with a yes/no option was the scexit 2014 referendum . 
  it would be dramatically worse than any possible brexit . 
  it 's fine to allow an independent country into the eu , but it 's not right to entice a country to break apart . 
  `` yes '' voters would be turkeys voting for christmas , but i am worried for the sake of the no voters . 
  the uk leaving the eu is a bigger deal for the eu than scotland leaving the uk is for the uk . 
  i had hoped we 'd got him after all that , but it turns out the frogs were the ones to finish him off . 
  respect for being in battle in your late 60s though .
