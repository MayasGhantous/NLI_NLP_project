  less likely with the south west , but i do know people who commuted to london from bristol . 
  then we 'll deal with wto rules . 
  it would be cutting off your nose to spite your face though . 
  to be honest what you 've said just exemplifies the problems with the eu in its present form . 
   the best access you can hope for while not being part of the single market is a free trade agreement with the eu . 
  i think that will be fine by most people . 
  that 's not what * you * meant , sure . 
   canada will soon trade with the eu under ceta . 
  that 's what we * mean * by access . 
  access like for example canada has access . 
  i know full-well that it 's not membership , which is why it would possibly be acceptable to the electorate . 
  no , we * will * have access . 
  it 's just the extent that is unknown . 
  which did actually exist : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smell-o-vision, 
  three were holding the prices down to get market share and now they 've ramped them up . 
  uk here . 
  it seems to be unlimited ... but then i 've never used more than 80gb in a month . 
  not setting the powder keg on fire is a bigger priority . 
  the eu needs to remain impartial in this , otherwise it would set a precedent that would worry other member states . 
  we will have access \\* to the single market . 
  obviously it wo n't be as complete as it is now , but it 's a fantasy of eu-nationalists that there will be some sort of trade blockade of the uk . 
  \\* ^ ( which is not to be confused with membership . ), 
  rent by location on a rather well-known topological map . 
  by the prices i would guess monthly for 1-bed flats . 
  do n't let your landlord see this map !, 
   tough luck , get a ticket and go to the back of the line for negotations about a trade deal , mongolia and zimbabwe are in front of you . 
  however much as you fantasise about it , that 's not going to happen . 
  `` these things '' is perfectly acceptable when writing about two things . 
  you 'll note that i said `` other '' rather than `` others '' . 
  fairly consistent i 'd say . 
  our inequality is definitely a cause for concern , but i do n't follow your point with the following :  lower paying jobs than the industrial jobs with strong unions kept paying what they should be paying which makes them lucrative to east europeans but not that lucrative ( or even available - not every one of them even can move to the big centers unlike the immigrants ) to a native . 
  if there was less migration , wages for these jobs would * have * to increase . 
  i suppose we 're debating cause and effect from opposite sides . 
  giving poorer british families more money from the state would do nothing to increase wages at the bottom end and i view these low wages as the root of the problem . 
  having said that , i did n't vote to leave the eu and i think on balance it 's not going to be great . 
  but we must n't pretend that being in the eu was that great either . 
  all migration plays a part , including internal migration within the uk . 
  as / u/ymmv _ says , often a larger house will be let out as an hmo ( house in multiple occupation ) where , e.g. 
  in london , they can charge # 700/month per room and get more money than if the whole property was let out to one family . 
  hopefully . 
  he 's been given a whole life order , which is the strongest sentence we are able to give :  the whole life order ( formerly a whole life tariff ) is a court order whereby a prisoner who is being sentenced to life imprisonment is ordered to serve that sentence without possibility of parole . 
  this order may be made in cases of aggravated murders committed by anyone who was aged 21 or above at the time of the crime . 
  the purpose of a whole life order is for a prisoner to be kept in prison until he or she dies , although in exceptional circumstances a prisoner can still be released by the home secretary on compassionate grounds such as great age or ill health . 
  a whole life tariff can also be quashed on appeal by the court of appeal . 
  it 's also rather sparingly used : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_prisoners_with_whole-life_tariffs you can expect him to die in prison . 
  i might be ( though my work is unaffected as we mostly work with commonwealth countries ) , but you might be vastly underestimating the damage done by low skilled migration on working class people and house prices . 
  worked out rather well for singapore tbh . 
  it 's not unthinkable that a country would want to kick the uk out , but it * is * basically impossible that * every * one of the eu-27 would want to do that and i ca n't see legislation being passed that would allow this on a simple majority basis . 
  the net figure was around # 200m iirc . 
  i personally thought it was probably ` worth it ' , but still probably cancelled out the vast majority of the benefits being in the eu brings . 
   you do n't get the members discount without fulfilling the members obligations . 
  true , but to get the members discount you have to pay that massive subscription fee . 
  the deal wo n't be too one sided , because if that 's all that 's offered there will be no deal at all . 
  russia annexed part of another country . 
  the uk indicated that it would like to leave a political and trade union . 
  one of these things is not like the other . 
  ok , i get it , you 're a troll . 
  why not ? 
  because it 's basically a hostile act that nothing good can come from . 
  ceta is just a trade deal . 
  what a pointless exercise . 
  that 's a button that would never be pressed , even in extreme circumstances . 
  it 's not far off 50/50 , maybe even tipping to unfavourable if you include russia ( yes , that 's europe too ) . 
  were they graduates ? 
  i 'm willing to try it , but i do n't think it would be possible to look dignified while eating this . 
  this is / r/europe , not / r/fansoftheeu . 
  because you were writing about how working as a bloc made us stronger and gave us leverage . 
  but now you 're effectively saying that it * does n't matter * because tariff money is just as good as changing china 's behaviour !, 
  has the behaviour of the us on tariffs actually changed china 's actions ? 
  so the netherlands will find itself even more at odds with the rest of the eu ? 
  i can see geert wilders smiling down on you !, 
  my point was mainly that we are not alone and you can not portray us as the `` bad guys '' without tarring your own country with the same brush . 
  very true , but we can rely on the ** dutch ** , * danish * and * swedish * continuing to block stricter anti-dumping tariffs after we leave !,

   good luck counteracting chinese subsidised dumping in any industry as a single country of 5-60 million . 
  you ca n't . 
  because europe 's coped so well with that ? 
  did n't know it was that deeply embedded . 
  well , hopefully public opinion will change over time !, 
  eventually , yeah . 
  it 's good that it happened , but you did n't exactly lead from the front . 
  ( not saying we did either , but nobody on / r/europe looks up to the uk as being progressive ) . 
  the net figure is about the same amount . 
  for what it 's worth , that money is spent within the uk , whereas the eu contribution was effectively sent off to eastern europe . 
  this means that while the subsidy to ni may be * slightly larger * it is a question of how the uk has decided to allocate resources , rather than the eu payment which is * taken * from the uk . 
  you 're best off asking a leave voter tbh . 
  i voted to stay in the eu and i 'm happy for ni to remain in the uk where it belongs . 
  the subsidy is there because ni * needs * it . 
  it 's not optional . 
  this is why i 'm puzzled that everyone seems to view ireland as super-progressive . 
  maybe brexit will be a loss to polish people , but would it be bad for * poland * ? 
  it would go some way to stopping the brain drain , right ? 
  nah you 're alright . 
  lucky we have this nice infographic to back us up !, 
  it 's not * all * corruption , but just `` households who paid a bribe when accessing basic services '' . 
  0 % sounds about right - i 've honestly * never * heard of * anyone * having to do that . 
  if they love money * that * much then they will stay in business rather than politics . 
  no , because only idiots believed that there would be no cost to leaving ( we do of course get * some benefits * from our payments ) . 
  however , does our net payment to the eu ( what is it , # 200m a week ? ), 
  give us at least an equivalent benefit ?
