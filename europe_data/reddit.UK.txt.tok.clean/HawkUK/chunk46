  ca n't see the government surviving after paying that sort of sum . 
  i 'd regard them as centrist , personally . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_times#political_allegiance though i could accept that they 're * a little bit * right leaning on economic issues . 
  for what it 's worth , they backed remain and have a broad spectrum of columnists on the left and right . 
  infighting , or just papers pushing stories from unreliable anonymous sources ? 
  the times is pretty moderate . 
  it does have difficulty understanding tech issues though . 
  would it be cruel to make eastern europeans pay the same as western europeans ? 
  just realised i never replied to this comment . 
  here goes !, 
   but do n't you think that the fact that your higher gdp and more specialised economy was due to be one foot in the eu and one foot out ( no schengen , no euro ) ? 
  if i was just talking about our finance industry , perhaps . 
  that was n't my intention though , rather that the uk ( along with france and others ) have more advanced economies than the eu average , especially now that the east really bulk out the numbers . 
  i do n't believe that will change with brexit . 
   i mean i 'm french and currently living in london , but that 's only because the job was good and the salary higher ( with the pound being 20-45 % higher than the euro ) . 
  yes , this has definitely made it less attractive for reu citizens to come to the uk . 
  it 's also made it more attractive for uk citizens to move to the eu , though it should be noted that the long term picture is less clear : http://i.imgur.com/f0g9j27.png personally the exchange rate has been great for me , as i work in a company that exports its services across the world . 
  we 've been able to win contracts that we 'd have previously struggled with . 
   now a lot of this attractiveness is gone and i 've seen a lot of my european friends leave . 
  i 've read this a lot online , but my experience with reu housemates and reu coworkers is that nothing has really changed . 
  our experiences are of course anecdotal . 
  i believe data has shown a fall in net migration but it 's still pretty high iirc . 
   your country will have to work a lot in educating its people at an affordable price in order to fix the lack of people like me ( who on top of working and creating value bring a lot of taxes ) . 
  it 's a very risky bet that the uk took . 
  i see this as potentially a pretty good thing . 
   do you think it 's worth it ? 
  if yes , why ? 
  i voted remain , but only after thinking on it for quite some time as i 'm fairly conflicted on the issue - particularly as a reduction in migration could go some way to solving our housing problem . 
  now a referendum has taken place we must follow through with it . 
  staying in the eu is not risk free either . 
  there is n't . 
  it 's a bribe . 
  a bloody big one at that . 
  it would be . 
  seems like far too much to me still . 
  the government is going to have to be very careful ; going away this amount of money could be enough to depose them . 
  you missed the part where i implied that the excess and telegraph are biased . 
  it 's not quite that bad . 
  it 's somewhere between the express and telegraph . 
  i think the loss on raw gdp or population is balanced by our higher gdp per capita and our more specialised economy when compared to the eu average . 
  it 's not just the walloons - every eu country had a veto . 
  we do n't have to worry about pleasing industries that simply do n't exist in the uk . 
  yes , 
  we 're hardly going to block food imports if we really need them . 
  by value we import significantly more food than russia . 
  the uk could get better trade deals as it wo n't making deals by committee with 28 vetoes . 
  the eu does n't block exports . 
  should be cheaper . 
  there 's also no indication in article 50 that it ca n't be revoked . 
  it 's a pretty minimalistic piece of legislation !, 
  the unanimity of the eu27 is required for an * extension * of the two year period , but there 's * nothing * about aborting the process altogether which is why many legal minds think the uk can unilaterally stop the process . 
  one other argument i 've read is that the very first line in a50 states :  any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance ** with its own constitutional requirements ** . 
  it could be interpreted that if the uk wanted to stay , then it would be * impossible * for us to be forced out as it would be against our constitutional requirements . 
  he definitely is . 
  i just wanted to point out that just next to greece are italy and the uk , so i 'm not sure that the pattern is that clear . 
  he wo n't agree . 
  he spends all day whining about the uk , despite living here . 
  i guess we just say `` nah , we 're good actually '' . 
  probably in a letter . 
  surely hardcore brexiters ( which should include all the ones who believe the eu is entirely undemocratic ) would be hoping that the eu27 somehow keep us out regardless of our government 's position . 
  they 're hoping there would have to be a vote . 
  it does not state that it is irrevocable . 
  it simply tells us one way in which it may be revoked . 
  if discussing it on / r/europe carried legal weight then sure . 
  the author of a50 himself says that it 's reversible and says `` legally [ the eu ] could n't insist that [ the uk ] leave '' . 
  the eu negotiating team says that it 's irrevocable . 
  however , they are n't the ones that would have to decide - that would be up to the courts . 
  yes , article 50 specifies a way for a50 to be nullified , but it ** does not ** state that this is the * only * way to stop the process . 
  a reversal is something that would probably disunite the 27 . 
  regardless , it may be legally possible for us to deactivate the notification without eu27 support . 
  they voted to leave because what they previously voted for was not actually what they got . 
  you 're the ones insisting we pay some fantasy mystery bill . 
  when were we helped out ? 
  this whole subreddit wanks itself to death over the size of the single market . 
  which is smaller than the usa . 
  and china if you 're talking ppp . 
  please . 
  this would be incredibly entertaining . 
   why would it improve the uk 's negotiating position ? 
  it would mean that the eurozone would ** need ** the eu to get a comprehensive trade deal .

  lucky the article explains it for you then !, 
  i particularly liked the bit where you wrote about disability benefit and showed your true colours . 
  that 's quite a different answer . 
  i expect most believe that they would find a new and better job in the post-brexit reality . 
  cut all eu funding then !, 
  exactly , brexit is far more civilized !, 
  irish independence good , british independence bad . 
  well we could have started working on that while remaining in the eu , then we 'd have voted to stay . 
  i 'd need to look up the data again , but they have a large number of agencies with a rather high average annual budget . 
  by `` valuable '' i mean that they pump money into the french economy . 
  france already has the most valuable agencies iirc, 
  we have a more specialised economy than the eu as a whole . 
  this will make deals easier and better . 
  wo n't have to protect certain industries that are simply do n't have . 
  in the uk we have ** none ** . 
  phased out the disk three or four years ago . 
  obviously it will be easier to reach agreement . 
  it 's 1:1 , not 1:28 .
