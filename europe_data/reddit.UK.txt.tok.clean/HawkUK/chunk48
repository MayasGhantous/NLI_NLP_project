  surely we 'd be * their * overlords ? 
  it 's great , is n't it . 
  such an angle makes sense when you 're displaying it on a widescreen format . 
  if we follow the irish logic on this thread , calling it that asserts that you own the north , which is actually kind of imperialistic !, 
  are you also going to argue that with the uk leaving the eu it should no longer be described as being in europe , or being european ? 
  they are between great britain and brittany , so i think it makes sense to group them with one or the other . 
  i believe it is currently the world 's longest country name . 
  if the uk had been invaded , do you really think they 'd have stopped at the ni/roi border ? 
  the uk is a union in name only . 
  it 's really a merger . 
  because they started an unjust war of expansion ? 
  and what has romania brought to the table ? 
  haha !, 
  some , but overall it could have saved many more . 
  maybe you would n't want to sacrifice irish lives to save other nationalities though ... 
  that can be applied to eu membership . 
  maybe it had great effects in the 80s , but is bad for us now . 
  so trade between eu and rest of world can be vast and beneficial . 
  good to know !, 
  ireland is much more dependant on exports than the uk . 
  even just the speed of sound screws up clapping . 
  the uk , as one of the p5 , has a veto at the icj . 
  i suppose we could agree not to use it , but what 's in it for us ? 
  as long as the currency is n't rapidly fluctuating the cost of imports does n't matter except for cashflow . 
  we have a veto . 
  the eu drew its red line on immigration first , admittedly , but that does n't make the uk `` wrong '' . 
  world famous for efficiency ? 
  i thought that was the swiss , or germans . 
  well my dad is bigger than your dad . 
  what does that have to do with any payment/bribe ? 
  how about your own guidelines ? 
  negotiations under article 50 teu will be conducted in transparency and as a single package . 
  in accordance with the principle that ** nothing is agreed until everything is agreed ** , individual items can not be settled separately . 
  the union will approach the negotiations with unified positions , and will engage with the united kingdom exclusively through the channels set out in these guidelines and in the negotiating directives . 
  so as not to undercut the position of the union , there will be no separate negotiations between individual member states and the united kingdom on matters pertaining to the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the union . 
  this . 
  assuming . 
  there . 
  deadlock . 
  for . 
  trade . 
  deal . 
  this is not a bond . 
  this is not credit of any sort and will not affect our credit rating . 
  rejecting any demands from the eu for funding will not affect our ability to sell bonds . 
  not transferring any funds would be keeping the agreement as it stands . 
  no sweat-pea , article 50 rids us of any obligations . 
  if you want money you 'll have to trade something for it !, 
  you 're really living up to your name . 
  no actual payment will be paid unless a trade agreement is in place . 
  you 're confusing coming to an agreement about the amount with actually * paying * said money . 
  the exit deal will be a package with any transfer of funds being just one part of the package . 
  if there is a collapse of talks and * no trade deal * then there will be * no payment * . 
   of what ? 
  the coal and steel community ? 
  fyi that treaty has expired . 
  there 's a common thread running through eu history . 
  individual treaties are replaced , but for example the cap still exists 55 years after it was created and is responsible for almost half the eu budget . 
  the community should have written an exit procedure into the initial treaties which could then have been amended as it evolved into the eu . 
   uk was there for the creation of eu . 
  from the eec onwards , we were . 
  the ecsc should have had an exit procedure . 
   when ? 
  i doubt they had the crystal ball to predict the necessity . 
  yes , why did n't uk do anything about it ? 
  as i said to begin with , * never start any organisation without planning for how members will leave * . 
   really ? 
  more power to brussels from national governments ? 
  and here i thought brexit was about taking the power back , but now you say one of the flaws of eu is that national governments have too much power over eu . 
  i actually voted to remain because this whole brexit thing is a lot of hassle . 
  i think the eu is only viable in the long term if the veto system is removed . 
  i 'm in favour of unitary government where possible and reducing devolution . 
  at the moment though , with the whole of the eu hostile towards it , the uk needs to get out asap . 
  we do n't owe any money after leaving , though some payment will likely be negotiated . 
  we 'd simply indicated that we were happy with the budget . 
  we will be obligated to pay into the budget until we leave . 
  `` pay us money [ you do n't actually owe ] or you might suffer serious economic damage '', 
  found this on wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_empires if you put british empire , french empire and german empire together you manage to get over ** a third ** of the planet 's landmass . 
  yes , it is , though i would put more blame on the founding members . 
  you should never create an organisation without a proper plan for those leaving . 
  they created such apparently immutable concepts as freedom of movement ( which i doubt would be created in the same way now as it was then ) , so why did n't they create an exit procedure ** set in stone ** * right at the beginning * ? 
  i expect that a50 is deficient because it could have been vetoed . 
  this meant that only the bare bones of an exit procedure were written for fear of it not being passed otherwise . 
  the fact that even small countries like malta have a veto is a fundamental problem with the eu . 
  it 's not our fault the eu does n't properly define the exit procedure . 
  the british public will be at breaking point if we give large sums away for nothing . 
  exactly . 
  that 's what i 'm getting at . 
  any amount we pay will be subject to negotiation . 
  try and extract your pound of flesh without something equally valuable in return will be futile . 
  a50 says that the treaties cease after two years . 
  the very same treaties that obligate us to pay anything at all . 
  the icj where the uk has a veto . 
  lol , you 've really done your research !, 
  no , we will only pay this protection money in return for something . 
  we will have no legal obligation to pay , unless we negotiate one . 
  it 's money we agreed to pay if we were eu members . 
  we will soon not be . 
  it will be in comparison to * no money * because that 's what happens if they reject a trade deal . 
  yes and if we 've agreed to any payments they 'll be factoring those in .
