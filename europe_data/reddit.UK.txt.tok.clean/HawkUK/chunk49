  the poor ones will think of the money they receive and the rich ones will think of the money they do n't have to pay . 
  a figure may be reached but nothing will actually be transferred until a ** good * !, 
  trade deal is settled . 
  we wo n't be paying any money until we know we 're getting something of equal value , 
  you 'll be paying too . 
  i still expect we 'll only agree to pensions at most . 
  covering the budget is ridiculous . 
  remember the quote `` nothing is agreed until everything is agreed '' . 
  whatever we agree to will depend on a good trade deal also being agreed . 
  you realise that finland and sweden were actually more averse to federalisation than the uk , right ? 
  how 's it better than your local site ? 
  does n't the postage costs make it rubbish too ? 
  what have we vetoed that nobody else vetoed ? 
  well , actually that 's pretty much par for the course . 
  lucky the uk is interested in free trade then !, 
  eventually , sure . 
  it 'll probably be great for you though , with all that funding , and you wo n't have to worry about migration ( inwardly , at least ) . 
  you get very few of us actually calling for the end of the eu . 
  hell of a straw man you have there !, 
  you 're not even in the eu ffs, 
  they look like festival toilets , but worse . 
  there are already different levels of participation ( see eu vs eea ) . 
  hopefully we can agree on something new  . 
  we gave our word that while eu members we were happy with the budget . 
  brexit changes this . 
  yes , i think it 's quite likely . 
  it 's tiny though . 
  i do n't think fom , in the form that it is now , is as popular as you imagine . 
  however , any changes could be vetoed which is why change is so difficult . 
  i expect their contracts are with the eu , not the uk , but i could be wrong . 
  might be the case , but it 's small fry compared to what was being asked in total . 
  let me share with you the relevant paragraph from article 50 : * 50.3 . 
  * *** the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question *** * from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or , failing that , two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2 , unless the european council , in agreement with the member state concerned , unanimously decides to extend this period . 
  * while we may have agreed to some budgets and long term plans , the actual mechanism for making the uk pay lies in the treaties it has with the eu . 
  treaties that will no longer reply in under two years . 
  that project looks cool , maybe we 'll pick it up if the eu drops it . 
  one could just as easily argue that the eu is wasting our time with such demands , rather than getting to the heart of a meaty trade deal . 
  i think using a bank analogy complicates things as most do n't have membership fees . 
  ( plus we 're in credit ) . 
  i think it 's more like being a member of a yacht club , being on the board , voting in favour of a new pontoon , then quitting . 
   no , the eu does not have to offer anything . 
  if it wants something , and does not have any usable legal avenues , it certainly does . 
   this is not a bargain or negotiation . 
  that 's exactly what it is . 
  they even describe it as such . 
   the eu has started infrastructure projects that will run for many years and who are included in multi-year budgets . 
  these are infrastructure projects that will benefit the eu . 
  it is only logical that the eu pays for them ( and adjust them to suit the remaining countries ) . 
   budgets who are approved by the member states including the uk . 
  we approved the budget . 
  just like members of a board in a company might . 
  they do n't become personally liable . 
   i would like to hear how the uk proposes these contractors are going to get paid . 
  by the eu , i would imagine . 
  after all , their contracts will be with the eu or the member state in which the work is being done . 
  most amusing that you consider this an important point when the [ * the european commission is demanding the right to cancel existing contracts without penalty if a supplier is no longer based in an eu member state * ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/2f0e7a6e-1eff-11e7-a454-ab04428977f9?mhq5j=e2 ) . 
  it does sound like the eu is seeking to punish british companies , so why should we even consider giving you anything ? 
   the original point was that there will be no deal because of a deadlock concerning this topic and if anything our discussion proves just that . 
  unfortunately quite possible . 
  a shame that the eu never had the foresight to include such exit bills in a50 . 
  the eu treats fom as a immutable . 
  however , it is merely the product of agreements . 
  agreements that can be changed . 
  unfortunately the eu is averse to change and considers the early agreements to be sacred texts that can not be altered . 
  we want a fair deal . 
  we are leaving the eu and a50 states that the treaties are void once the timer runs out . 
  this includes any obligation to continue paying into the budget . 
  we 're already a huge net contributor that has paid hundreds of billions in over the years . 
  asking for more seems pretty spiteful and entitled . 
  we would like free trade . 
  we do not wish to continue with other parts of the relationship which we dislike . 
  maybe they have a point . 
  what it means is that rather than being a simple legal obligation , if the eu wants money it must offer something of equal value in return . 
  if the eu was n't so insistent in adhering to it 's religion on freedom of movement then the eea would be great ... 
  we agreed the eu budget . 
  leaving the eu means we no longer do . 
  it 's an eu budget , not a uk budget . 
  there is no reason to pay an exit bill . 
  it is the eu 's hubris ( aka belief that nobody would ever want to leave ) that means no exit payment is defined in the treaties for joining . 
  therein lies the problem . 
  but with the exit bill that the eu conjured up , i would say it is the least reasonable party . 
  we are happy to sign a fair free trade deal . 
  we 're aiming for the best free trade possible with the eu . 
  as much as is possible without actually having to be subject to eu law domestically , including migration . 
  you can still come to london to do finance . 
  this can easily happen , but only if you 're reasonable in your demands . 
  everything will be fine if the eu are prepared to accept a reasonable deal . 
  do you think they are n't ? 
   so , we can always try other financial centres , if it 's expensive to finance yourself in paris or frankfurt . 
  we can go to new york , which is going to be bigger anyway , once the city cuts itself off . 
  so europe loses because the eu has delusions of grandeur . 
  better go thousands of miles away for finance than to the equivalent place on your doorstep . 
  yup , that makes sense ... 
  he got ** nothing substantial ** with regards to migration . 
  that 's why it was a complete and absolute failure . 
  the eu threw dave a few crumbs and then acted surprised when the british electorate took it as an insult . 
  how about the cap gets reformed so that france et al no longer have the inbuild advantage ? 
  oh , thought not !, 
   if , as i suspect , the uk would have to leave and rejoin which is ** not ** going to happen . 
  a turnaround is a remote possibility , but still * possible * .
