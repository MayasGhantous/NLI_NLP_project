  what you propose is basically impossible . 
  nobody wants to euro . 
  nobody wants schengen . 
  remainers would become brexiteers . 
  i really doubt the change will be that big , but hey it might reduce house prices which would be great . 
  it would be their children and not the first wave of migrants ( as first generation non-commonwealth can not vote ) . 
  minorities generally vote labour . 
  yes , labour / tony blair decided it would be a good idea to import natural labour voters . 
  the point is that there 's nothing we can do now at all . 
  i think it was a grenfell joke ... 
  it pretty much does . 
  there are precious few reasons an eu citizen can be stopped from moving here . 
  that 's one viewpoint , yes . 
  but the single market as it stands is only one idea of what a single market should be . 
  we propose an alteration !, 
  in descending order , what we would like is : eu minus fom . 
  single market minus fom hard brexit, 
  schengen has nothing to do with eu migration . 
  we have full obligations of freedom of movement which the voters were unhappy with . 
  link to story please !, 
  anyone in the eu could move here and we 're powerless to stop them unless they 're actually destitute . 
  do you have the minutes of the meetings ? 
  he clearly wanted much more control over migration , as that 's all that would have been needed to crush ukip and the brexiteers . 
  what ? 
  we can stop eu citizens migrating here ? 
  that 's new !, 
  i think you 're getting confused . 
  it did n't offer anything that anybody cared about . 
  cameron was supposed to come home with shiny deal and the eu would be loved . 
  that 's not what happened . 
  he came back with a turd . 
  i do expect that if the eu had known leave would win on the back of that deal , they 'd have been rather more generous . 
  yeah that seems to be the current state of affairs . 
  the numbers move around a fair bit , so it 's only fair to take a long term view . 
  one is available on wiki , but it 's still a bit spartan : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#funding_by_member_states uk paid 0.25 % of gni over that period and finland paid 0.24 % of gni . 
  gni being another way to look at it , especially as the actual payment calculation involves gni . 
   other countries have actually also gotten their fees lowered but the magnitude has been a fraction of the uk figures . 
  i do n't know anything about that . 
  got a source ? 
  in percentage terms is theirs really that different to ours ? 
  the fact is that if the uk was a founding eu member then the payments structure would be entirely different . 
  the founding members set it up in a way that benefited them . 
  i use france as an example because it is so similar to the uk in many ways ( population , size of economy etc ) . 
  france benefits ** greatly ** from the cap . 
  rather than change the way the eu distributes funds to make it fair overall , we got the rebate/correction as a fudge . 
  i agree that it 's not fair on other countries that do n't do well from the cap * and * do n't get a rebate , but i do n't view it as any more unfair than the deal the french get by virtue of setting the payment structures up in the first place . 
  i was looking here this time : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8036097.stm#start admittedly this one is pretty old ( just happened to be first in my google search results ) and is only for one year . 
  when i did the calculations comparing us to france i used data up to 2014 iirc and was able to show that our per-capita contribution was basically the same each year . 
  how do you mean ? 
  we contribute a hell of a lot . 
  way more per capita than finland . 
  my guess is that you 're upset with the rebate which is really a ** correction ** . 
  it puts us on the same level as france . 
  i do n't see anyone around here complaining about how little france contribute !, 
  which were you most unhappy with ? 
  exemption from fom * going forward * ( those already using it can continue ) . 
  i think germans see themselves as the eu . 
  the british generally see the eu as something completely separate to the countries under its rule . 
  assuming you 're finnish ( as looks likely ) , you should know that your country is strongly opposed to federalisation and is often a uk ally inside the eu . 
  it ca n't be stopped unless the eu makes concessions , which wo n't happen . 
  they will be staying in the eu under eu law . 
  this is fine , just as european citizens staying in the uk should be here under uk law after brexit . 
  the eu wants its courts to have supremacy over the uk 's * within the uk * . 
  unacceptable . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  if you ask for something unreasonable and do n't give any ground then there is ** no deal ** whatsoever . 
  if we demanded # 100bn from the eu it would also be unreasonable . 
  i would rather we had an ultra-hard brexit than give into unreasonable demands . 
  you ca n't push for something unreasonable . 
  eu courts overriding the uk in british territory is ** not acceptable ** . 
  it 's extremely undemocratic . 
  not if you want a good deal . 
  i 've read that on the internet , but never heard anyone call them that in real life . 
  usually referred to as a `` speed camera '' in the uk . 
  we ca n't `` negotiate '' but we can * negotiate * . 
  why not ? 
  the usa has plenty of trade deals that are mutually beneficial and do n't require full submission to a foreign court or demand that anyone can migrate regardless of ability . 
  what a nuanced response . 
  she 's not under pressure to sign a bad deal . 
  no deal is better than a bad deal . 
  i 'd wager that it will be less unbalanced than our current relationship with the eu . 
  i feel that gibraltar means they start off at maximum pissed-offness . 
  might as well see how far we can push it !, 
  cornwall can !, 
  cameron basically went to the other eu leaders and asked for * anything * to allow some control over migration . 
  i 'm sure all options were explored , but he was snubbed and the lack of any concessions was a boon for the leave campaign . 
  the eu could have recognised that we did n't apply restrictions in the past and allowed us to apply the restriction now instead . 
  would have probably prevented brexit . 
  why do you care so much about what we do ? 
  you are n't unhappy that other counties are independent ... 
  well yes , that 's shit . 
  but most people earn significantly more than minimum wage . 
  arguably it 's migrants from london causing a housing crisis in cornwall . 
  there you can find some of the worst earnings to house prices ratios . 
  and any businesses wanting to do anything in the uk will be subject to our courts . 
  this is normal . 
  working a low paid job here is enough . 
  come here . 
  get a part time job in a supermarket . 
  pay very little tax .
