  receive more benefits than the tax you pay . 
  this shit will eventually turn ardent remainers into hard-brexitets . 
  it 's a problem for isis admittedly !, 
  i think anybody who considers scexit a good idea should be put into a blender , but whatever . 
  you do realise that each eu passport offers different rights ? 
  unless you actually become one country then this will be perfectly normal . 
  the eu could have recognised our issues with immigration and granted as at least a temporary exemption from fom . 
  it did n't exactly help itself , though i agree that blair 's decision ( which was probably made to import labour voters ) was a death warrant . 
  let me guess : you think scexit would be great !, 
  always interesting how everyone is happy with the eu sanctioned ban on accession country workers , but loses their sit at a reasonable request for controls ( ** not ** a complete ban ) at a later date . 
  defence is about 2 % of uk gdp including trident . 
  it barely makes a dent . 
  personally i consider the republic 's insistence on neutrality to be incredibly irresponsible . 
  it 's very well integrated with the uk , 
  it is . 
  just a democracy we are leaving . 
  if we were in a union with africa and got continuously overruled on gay rights that would still be democracy . 
  i agree . 
  we 'll be moving towards independence but it wo n't be 100 % . 
  not fully . 
  sure , it 's not like we were part of another sovereign state , but we did get overruled and had to accept majority rule on many issues . 
  there is some intriguing doublethink in this subreddit where the eu is all powerful yet member states are completely autonomous . 
  the truth is somewhere in between . 
  independence does n't mean we were subjugated , just that we 'd like to go it alone . 
  get a provisional driving license . 
  it 's cheap and fits in your wallet . 
  usually that 's what people are talking about . 
  more catholics = joining the republic . 
  joining the republic is a pretty risky prospect anyway . 
  you 'd lose the nhs and there 's no guarantee that the republic would bother to replace the # 10bn a year subsidy that ni gets from gb . 
  exactly . 
  the fact is simply that millions of people live here and we need to build many more high density homes in london . 
  as if we 've finished bombing arab counties . 
  a majority of * catholics * do not want to join the republic . 
  the uk has around 220,000 romanians in the over here under fom . 
  maybe this is an advantage for us , but we could easily have achieved the same result outside the eu if we wanted to ( unless you plan to imprison your population within your borders ) and probably excluded the gypsies at the same time . 
  the uk actually has a trade deficit with romania , so it 's benefiting you more than us . 
  secondly , trade is not suddenly going to cease due to our independence . 
  you may as well ask if the roi is wanting to reunify with the uk . 
  neither is going to happen . 
  that 's ok for you to say in a country that is a net beneficiary of the eu budget . 
  ( it 's more like $ 10bn btw . 
  in sure the netherlands will be very happy to pay more ... 
  ah yes , i 'm sure those 95 all care more about mauritius than trade with the uk . 
  what i mean is that the uk has a veto . 
  the icj ca n't make that happen . 
  you could allow us to control immigration . 
  they did n't want out . 
  not unilaterally . 
  fuck that . 
  except it has n't . 
  it 's shit , but it 's better than being led by junker :3 . 
  the eu wants money for very practical reasons . 
  the left-over 27 will be fighting tooth and nail with each other to avoid having to stump up more cash , or avoid losing out on subsidies . 
  i see you used the empire argument . 
  that 's great because it means i can see you 've already lost . 
  before we developed , sure . 
  we 're not going anywhere , despite your fantasies of our ruin . 
  edit : and playing the empire card . 
  you continentals are obsessed with it . 
   which the uk knew and invoked anyway , without even doing the most basic prep work needed even if the framework was just how you would.like it . 
  you gave us no choice . 
  would you have preferred that we just unilaterally withdrew from all eu treaties ? 
   this shows complete ignorance of history . 
  every developed country that gained independence from the uk is doing rather well for itself . 
   so again , the people that actually caused all this are not to blame , but the people who tried to stop it are ? 
  some strange reasoning there . 
  no , you ca n't hold the uk hostage to the eu 's broken legislation . 
  we took our time to activate a50 . 
  we took our time trying to sort out residency rights . 
  the ball was now in your court , which you simply ignored . 
   so wanting to use the officially established channels for international negotiation is `` pathetic '' but blindly causing the problem in the first place and then crying how everybody is unfair for not solving your problem is n't ? 
  yes . 
  it is pathetic . 
  article 50 was never written to be used . 
   the uk in a nutshell shit their pants by themselves and are now blaming the eu for not giving them a new set . 
  possibly the most broken analogy i 've read this year - arguably the smelliest shit around here is the steaming pile that is a50 itself . 
  what is your point again ? 
  looks to be about 7 % , so even if it dropped by that much ( absolutely not happening ) , we 'd still be at about 15-16 % of the eu economy . 
  it does seem that there 's a big effort on here to portray the uk as some insignificant country of no importance to the eu . 
  that could n't be further from the truth . 
  mate , we 've been a pretty ok country for centuries . 
  it 's not going to change because of a few tariffs . 
  actually the uk is more important to the eu than california is to the usa . 
  uk is 17 % of eu economy . 
  ca is 14.5 % of us economy . 
  some , usually when there are armies along borders . 
  generally its give-and-take . 
  if the eu offers nothing then there 's no deal . 
  we are ** not ** a founding member state . 
  it 's the founding members that created the clusterfuck of the cap that we would never have allowed had we been at the table at the time . 
  in addition , they are `` exceptions '' not perks . 
  many on this subreddit consider them downgrades . 
   so again . 
  the eu should save the uk from it 's own mistakes . 
  try reading again . 
  the eu has created a framework for leaving that is not fit for purpose . 
   the eu was very clear how harmful and destructive the uk its actions would be , but the uk did it any way . 
  yeah every country gets told that before its independence . 
  usually it works out quite well in the end .
