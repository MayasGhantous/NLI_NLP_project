   first you tell tje eu that you want to be `` independent '' , then when your actions prove harmful to your own you get angry that they do n't come to your rescue . 
  nope . 
  i 'm suggesting that the eu might want to reassure its citizens rather than play geopolitical games . 
  the `` i was only following [ my own ] orders '' defence is pathetic . 
  if you measure it in purely in dollars , sure . 
  exchange rates are n't that big a deal . 
  there are benefits and disadvantages to high or low rates . 
  ours was too high actually . 
  perhaps it 's too low now , but it 's actually been great for my company . 
  pathetic . 
  we were happy to work with eu , but the price the eu demands is far too high . 
  we will do our best to get a ** mutually ** beneficial deal , but that does * not * involve emptying our pockets . 
  we will not accept anything less . 
  most of the developed world is not in the eu and does just fine . 
  we 'll be joining them . 
  hiding behind rules at the expense of people is for cowards . 
  we 've cancelled nothing yet . 
  we activated a specific treaty that the eu wrote designed for this purpose . 
  it 's not ( exclusively ) our fault that it 's badly written - every country can take credit . 
  why ? 
  a50 is ill defined and once we 've left the eu at the end of that process the only court you could go to is the icj at which we have a veto . 
  if we pay it is because we negotiate a payment for something . 
  lol , and you complain about us using card analogies . 
  they would n't need to suffer if the eu had pulled its head out of its arse and engaged in pre-a50 negotiations regarding the status of citizens post brexit . 
  the uk has always been seeking a like-for-like deal in this area which would not be dependent on anything else , however the eu decided to keep citizens as a bargaining chip instead . 
  it wo n't tank . 
  no doubt if the eu was actually demanding the death of every firstborn in return for an fta many on here would call us stupid for not accepting it . 
  there is a limit . 
  at some point we have to say no . 
   did the eu create more wealth in the uk then it cost the uk ? 
  equally sure . 
   equally sure no . 
  the answer is ** maybe ** . 
  we do n't know yet . 
  # 8bn a year invested in the economy could do wonders . 
  article 50 means that all treaties get nullified once the timer runs out  . 
  if the eu wants anything , it has to negotiate for it . 
  in addition , approving a budget means just that . 
  we approve of the budget for the time we are in the eu and not after . 
  a * budget * is not a promise to pay . 
  i voted remain because i thought leaving would be a bit of a hassle and probably a bit rocky for a year or two . 
  it 'll be fine though . 
  we 'll knock out an fta and we 'll be saving # 8bn a year . 
  we are perfectly capable of being an independent country . 
  we will pay what is legally required . 
  which is quite possibly zero . 
  anything we pay on top of that will be in return for something of equivalent value . 
  people like you are going to find out that life goes on and that there 'll really be very few changes to day to day life . 
  i 've pasted the article text . 
  good enough ? 
  #article text germany has offered a soft brexit with a reduced jurisdiction for eu judges over britain and continued access to europe 's single market in return for a british concession on free movement . 
  sigmar gabriel , the german foreign minister , suggested yesterday that european countries were willing to make trade-offs in advance of negotiations on britain 's withdrawal from the eu . 
  talks begin in brussels today . 
  `` perhaps there is now a chance to achieve a so-called soft brexit , '' he told germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper yesterday . 
  eu negotiators are stressing that there is room to find a compromise because they fear that without one , a weakened theresa may would not survive the duration of brexit talks this summer , a critical period of negotiations . 
  `` it is the greatest uncertainty as we begin , '' one eu negotiator said . 
  `` will the prime minister still be there at key decision moments over the summer ? 
  a weak government like this increases the risk of there being no deal at the end of the process . 
  we do not want to be the ones making the situation more difficult . '' mr gabriel said that britain would have to allow free movement for europeans to keep full access to the single market but offered a major concession of `` a joint court that is staffed by europeans and britons which in principle follows the decisions of the european court of justice '' . 
  ending the jurisdiction of the eu court over britain is a key target for mrs may and the german proposal could be a breakthrough . 
  the new structure could be combined with the idea of an emergency brake , allowing restrictions to be agreed on eu migration by the new legal body if high numbers cause disruption to labour markets or public services . 
  eu diplomats believe that mrs may might use a brussels summit dinner behind closed doors this thursday to signal a step change in her approach to brexit , allowing concessions to be presented as a fait accompli after difficult negotiations . 
  since the election , britain has dropped opposition to the eu demand for the so-called divorce bill to be settled before trade talks can begin because it gives mrs may time to change position on the single market and what customs arrangement she will pursue . 
  battles within the government over whether to seek a new post-brexit customs union with the eu could be settled in confidential diplomatic negotiations to prevent a hard border between northern ireland and the irish republic . 
  `` doing a deal on ireland and preserving the good friday agreement might be the way the government quietly changes direction with a new agreement that will also be the template for the wider one with the eu , '' said a diplomatic source . 
  the german offer of a joint arbitration court could provide a breakthrough on the question of rights for europeans living in britain by diluting a demand from the european commission for eu judges to have sole jurisdiction over disputes on residency entitlements that will last for decades . 
  during `` very constructive '' technical talks earlier this week , eu officials indicated willingness to compromise on the brexit bill , due in 2019 . 
  no figure will be set until talks close next year `` but a number will be whispered early in the negotiations , '' a source said , adding : `` we will set out principles and methodology not an algorithm . '' sources estimate that the final settlement will be about $ 40 billion in net terms and will be spread out over five years at much lower levels than britain 's current contributions . 
  it will plug the eu 's budget black hole in 2019 and 2020 . 
  despite a willingness to compromise , mrs may will face anger when she attends a council of eu leaders in brussels on thursday . 
  mr gabriel said that her decision to hold a snap election had ended up creating a `` difficult , even impossible situation , without clear majorities and clear negotiation strategy '' . 
  he added : `` here , those who created such chaos would have long since gone . 
  we will negotiate fairly , and fair means that we want to keep the british as close as possible to the eu but never at the price that we divide the remaining 27 eu states . '', 
  nah this actually is true . 
  get real mate . 
  yeah , impedance * should * be matched but that 's not everything . 
  earbuds are going to be much louder than earphones . 
   the bill is n't a penalty , it 's simply the costs the eu will have to pay for all the things still related to the former uk after they leave . 
  such as pensions and the like . 
  * some * of it is like that . 
  other bits are pretty spurious . 
  regardless , we 've paid in so much more than we 've taken out that most people consider that we owe the eu ** nothing ** . 
  the public really are n't keen on freedom of movement as it 's so one sided ( so many more people immigrate here than emigrate ) . 
  if the eu allowed us to control migration brexit would never have been an issue . 
  unfortunately they wo n't negotiate on that , so we 'll have to leave . 
  problem is that the phones have no idea how loud the earphones actually are . 
  it has its advantages . 
  i 'd prefer full brexit tbh, 
  hahaha , this really needs to go on / r/shitamericanssay . 
  amazing . 
  best bit was where you thought your practically monolingual states with only a few hundred years of notable history are as diverse as any across the world !, 
  nobody outside of this subreddit has the remotest interest in copying the us in europe . 
  we 'd love free trade , but the demands that the eu as an organisation places on us to get that are simply unacceptable . 
  why do n't you want to join the eu then ? 
   the abstract costs and benefits as you put them are unknown . 
  we 're going to find out . 
  it 'll probably be pretty similar . 
  we 're still happy to maintain a single market of goods and services . 
  it 'll be the eu 's fault if that stops just because fom is like a religion to them . 
  we just want to be an independent country again .
