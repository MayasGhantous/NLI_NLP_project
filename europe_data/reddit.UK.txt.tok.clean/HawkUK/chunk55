  can also be read as : #brexit talks with uk ` will be delayed by a year ' due to eu 's negotiating stance, 
  we agreed a budget framework . 
  we did not agree to continue payments after leaving the eu . 
  the article that deals with leaving the eu mentions nothing about leaving fees , but * does * say that all of the membership treaties are void after leaving . 
  the eu 's fantasy demands of * pay first , pray ( you get what you need ) later * were never acceptable and it 's laughable that they ever thought this was the case . 
  i still stand by what i say . 
  ** any ** organisation or country is self-serving . 
   are we here to make a buck it has looked that way so far though ... 
  the eu does n't do favours . 
  unless they benefit itself . 
  well this is odd . 
  before it was `` this is impossible '' , now it 's `` this would take some time '' . 
  fair enough , it would explain why you got out . 
  i assumed with an eu flag that you 'd be from the continent . 
  i do think some of our housing looks pretty shit , but supermarkets !? 
  i feel like we 're pretty much the european leader on those . 
  never liked those i 've found on the continent . 
  then why do so many of you come here !? 
  it absolutely perplexes me ... ( unless it 's just about speaking english ) . 
  it might be . 
  it would have to go to court for us to find out though . 
  in simple terms it 's a correction that makes up for what we lose on the common agricultural policy . 
  ahh yes , the rebate that just makes us level with france . 
  how terrible of us . 
  imagine your meps deciding that a coalition with ukip was a good idea . 
  they would n't last long would they . 
  very arrogant man . 
  too full of himself . 
  cities declare first ( easier to count ) . 
  cities vote for labour . 
  it usually defends whatever the eu try to do . 
  alfex salmond * likely * to lose his seat . 
  the gods are smiling !, 
  i do n't know but it 's lovely . 
  this evening is incredible . 
  i can not get to sleep and my alarm is set for three hours from now . 
  i think it would be unlikely , but they wo n't win next time . 
   do you think that if ukip refused to take the european parliament seats brexit could have gone different ? 
  people who voted for them did n't give a fuck whether they turned up or not . 
  yup . 
  i think it 's still going to be a tory government . 
  maybe a new pm though . 
  they won 13 of 72 of the uk 's seats in the eu ( 18 % ) in 2009 . 
  sinn fein won 5 of 18 of ni 's seats in the uk ( 28 % ) in 2010 . 
  i think the comparison works if you compare ni to the uk in the same way that you can compare the uk to the eu . 
  but soft brexit means we 'll still be paying the eu loads of money and not even getting a say in how it 's run . 
  i ca n't imagine this being a very popular outcome . 
  how can you take your seat ** and ** have a secessionist ni actually go through with it ffs . 
  seems pretty neutral to me . 
  ukip thought it was best to show up . 
  worked well for them so far . 
  theresa wheeled her out to take her place in the debate . 
  thought she did ok . do n't personally have an opinion on her overall . 
  without the snp it would be difficult !, 
  and the european ununion !, 
  let 's see / r/europe defend this !, 
  exactly . 
  this is much more like watching the eurovision results . 
  oh completely true . 
  worst still are the fast a-roads that are single carriageway . 
  particularly ones with a middle lane ... 
  no , not at all . 
  i 'm just wondering if may called the election at the bare minimum possible notice , or if she could have actually held it earlier . 
  would it have been possible to call the election at * shorter * notice ? 
  @britainelects just tweeted that alex salmond could lose his seat . 
  fuck , that would be absolutely ** beautiful ** . 
  the snp basically ran * against * the democratic choice of scotland when it comes to scexit . 
  it 's not that surprising . 
  i saw a tweet that labour and tories were doing better than expected in scotland . 
  yes . 
  sunderland ( our rival city ) and newcastle ( my city ) are racing to declare their results first in minutes . 
  they 'll be labour wins of course ... 
  ft should get a mention , but it 's a bit specialist . 
  if you changed the signs to blue , a lot of our dual carriageways could easily be mistaken for a motorway . 
  some even have full size hard shoulders . 
  it 's more that people just wanted to stick with what they knew . 
  i was disappointed though . 
  i like them a lot more than labour at present , but trying to stay in the eu seems a stupid idea right now and they are a bit too weak on defence . 
  hate the internet censorship , but i do n't think it will be all that successful so not too worried about it . 
  unsure about changing human rights legislation ( i 'm open to changes , because who 's to say we got it right the first time ) . 
  i do n't consider myself a tory , but a centrist . 
  corbyn with his anti-trident stance is an impossible option for me . 
  sort of . 
  more like recording how many people leave the club for one hour , then allowing that number in over the next hour . 
  do n't personally know a club that does that ( maybe they do , but they keep it quiet ... ) . 
  voting tory in a labour safe seat . 
  i do want the tories to win , but i do n't like them that much . 
  my main goal is to make my seat a little less safe and make the tories more interested in our seat and make labour a little less complacent with it . 
  they generally just buy the newspaper they agree with . 
   brexiteers may well think that leaving the eu will accomplish that , although from my point-of-view they are only considering the wellbeing of the uk this is true , just as many scexiteers believe in benefiting scotland at the expense of ruk . 
  these are admittedly the oil conspiracy types mostly , but they seem large in number on / r/scotland . 
   i think it 's important to consider the wellbeing of everybody ( not just ourselves ) , and i think the whole point of the eu is that we are all stronger together . 
  arguably those who fight for a protectionist eu are wanting to increase the wellbeing of people in the eu at the expense of people in the developing world . 
   by helping other countries when they are down we create a better and ( hopefully ) more stable shared economy . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with this , though many brexiteers would rather have such shared risk and responsibility with the english speaking commonwealth ( whether that could ever happen is another matter ) , just as you would rather have such shared risk and responsibility with the eu over some more distant countries . 
  the eu takes a great deal of money from the richer nations , but does n't give them much back in terms of flexibility . 
  if it was noted that due to our significant contributions we would be allowed flexibility on fom then we would n't be in this mess . 
   so , back to the issue of scotland ; we may well be worse off in the eu without the uk than we would in the uk without the eu , but only temporarily . 
  and by remaining a part of the eu we can help to keep it that much stronger . 
  this is again a carbon copy of a brexiteer argument .
