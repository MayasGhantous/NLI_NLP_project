  article 50 arguably makes it a no-fault divorce . 
  in this case the eu wants to move its furniture . 
  which is fine , but you get to pay for the removal lorry . 
  presumably they * chose * the job , knowing the location - perhaps because they had connections or because they simply liked the idea of living there . 
  if they did n't want to move to london they 'd have applied somewhere else . 
  it could become a join eu-uk agency  . 
  we 've made it very clear that we 're not the ones who 'll be moving the agency . 
  i was talking about the non-uk citizens actually . 
  probably about to be forced to go to some random eastern european country with which they have zero connections . 
  some of them might be . 
  most of them wo n't be . 
  probably most would consider london to be home by now . 
  you really do seem like a bit of a nationalist cunt . 
  we 'll see about that , once the eu eventually gets its act together and eliminates its internal tax havens . 
  you ca n't cherry pick - it has to be the whole uk  i do n't really see anyone wishing to end the cta apart from hardcore eu nationalists . 
  not all that new . 
  remember beslan ? 
  it 's quite popular to say `` well , if we 're going to be out we may as well be properly out '' . 
  exactly, 
  the uk and roi are very keen on free movement of people on these islands . 
  the uk simply does n't want to add the whole of europe to that , just as the eu does n't want to add the whole of africa and the middle east . 
  a lot of remainers are eurosceptic to a degree . 
  i voted remain but believe that the eu is deeply flawed and that simply , on balance , staying put was the safer option . 
  we do n't seriously think that any great number of eu migrants would bother to come here ** illegally ** when they could legally stay anywhere in the eu . 
  to actually make that * impossible * we 'd have to stop anyone from the eu visiting for business or holiday entirely , which was never going to happen . 
  we are n't worried about that . 
  the only people we have a problem with are like the calais migrants , who certainly wo n't be easily getting to ireland . 
  wan na make a bet ? 
  that 's not how it will work . 
  folding in line with public opinion . 
  public opinion would also never allow her to agree to these ridiculous terms . 
   if it were a member country then that 's a different issue that can be resolved internally . 
  ireland ? 
  you seem to be missing the key point . 
  the uk is ** not ** going to be blocking europeans from coming here on holiday . 
  we will merely be restricting the right to live and work here . 
  ireland is not a problem - it may be a back door into the uk , but we 're leaving the front door wide open . 
  it 's only the customs border that the eu can force anyway . 
  let 's see how bloody minded they are . 
  the uk has opened the issue , but it is up to the eu to make its move as the uk and roi have plainly stated that they want an open border . 
  the only way we wo n't have one is if the eu force one . 
  we will clean it up together , if the eu allows us , 
  i would call those that trust both governments to be eurosceptic to a degree . 
  the uk has said it would like to continue to have an open border on the island of ireland . 
  the republic of ireland agrees . 
  therefore if a hard border is created it will be the eu 's fault and no anyone else 's . 
  only if you consider the uk to be a prime mover and the eu to have no agency . 
  hell , if you want to blame the uk you may as well go further back and blame the republic for creating itself in the first place - it is after-all why a border exists at all . 
  there are differences , but the uk , roi , and the eu are at least looking into such a light-touch border . 
  especially low import duties to norway from third countries are just as much a risk to eu 's tariffs as the uk would be . 
  very true , but having a hard border forced upon you is a pretty negative thing and may outweigh many of the eu 's positive aspects . 
  possibly * all * positive aspects . 
  i did say `` to a degree '' . 
  if irish interests are ignored by the eu , then the eu can * eventually * say goodbye to ireland . 
   that is a contradition in terms . 
  no more than the current state of the single market , which has plenty of barriers particularly in respect of services . 
  we will stop the free movement of people , but that is still compatible with open borders with ireland . 
  we 're not going to be stopping europeans visiting . 
  but it is not in the customs union . 
  we are discussing the issue of a customs border . 
  seems a reasonable sacrifice to keep open borders . 
  there are customs checks between norway and sweden . 
  there are sporadic checks and cars rarely need to stop . 
  anpr used for tracking suspicious patterns of movement . 
  nah , we 'll leave the single market ( unless the eu sees sense and offers single market minus fom ) but there will be no hard border unless the eu forces one upon roi . 
  the republic of ireland and the united kingdom do not want a hard border , so the only way we 'll get one is if the eu force one on us . 
  we only need to worry about a customs border , which could be fairly frictionless . 
  it 's not the uk government that would impose a hard border . 
  those 43 % are probably eurosceptic to a degree . 
  if companies move over here they create jobs , under our laws . 
  nobody 's opposed to that . 
  they * are * opposed to unskilled migration . 
  what i 'm proposing is what the people want , not some blind unwanted ideological dream . 
  the white paper that the snp produced for independence said scotland would pay all pensions . 
  we too would like a third way . 
  being in the single market comes with too many disadvantages , so we 'd prefer something like canada has . 
   brexit will spur further reduction of exports to the uk which is exactly what they 're worried about . 
  your attitude is puzzling . 
  sure , you can see export growth elsewhere as a good thing , but cheering on the loss of trade to any particular country seems very , very , very odd . 
  it is legally speaking a central part of the single market . 
  however , this is a legal position and not some divine truth . 
  it would not be hard to have restrictions on freedom of movement and remain in the single market - after all , such an exception already exists for lichtenstein, 
  an 11 digit number that has literally been made up . 
  i 'd wager that you 'd still be baying the blood if the eu were trying to charge an even more nonsensical 20 digit number . 
  we have paid huge sums into the eu for decades . 
  we are not switzerland . 
  we will not bend over for you . 
  we would only agree to a trade deal that covered services  . 
  ** the beatings will continue until moral improves . 
  that sounds a bit trumpy . 
  we do n't want the same deal as norway . 
  we want good trade links etc , but no freedom of movement . 
  now norway considers fom a privilege , so would see our deal as * worse * than theirs  . 
  you seem like a really nice person . 
  funny how certain things are left out of the single market . 
  i guess you can cherry pick . 
  maybe they are , just not in huge numbers . 
  there have certainly been reports of small sailing vessels dropping migrants off in cornwall . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  we would just refuse all ships coming from calais or anywhere else that 's high risk .
