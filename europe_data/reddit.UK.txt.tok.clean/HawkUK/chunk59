  we 'll close the door then . 
  to be more specific , south-east border . 
  i thought most of these guys came via italy . 
  yes , but migrants tend to hide in lorries etc. 
  no no , we 're talking transport companies . 
  brittany ferries . 
  eurostar . 
  that sort of thing . 
  did you not read op 's comment ? 
  they were proposing that the fee be levied on companies who allow stowaways . 
  detain them until they agree to go home or to apply for asylum in france . 
  maybe you should just protect your southern border more too . 
  we should continue to pay our membership fees until we leave , but there 's no reason we 'd have to pay beyond that except in return for something . 
  let 's see how this plays out . 
  i doubt we 're going to see a sudden flood of migrants to the uk because of this . 
  if that were to happen we 'd just close those links . 
  what shitty deal ? 
  why do n't you deal properly with the camps . 
  why stop at # 20k ? 
  surely we should charge enough to cover the lifetime costs to the state of a refugee . 
  i 'm sure it 's much more than that . 
  there is no guarantee that paying this bribe would actually make for a better trade deal . 
  only in a `` make the mexicans pay for it '' kind of way . 
  not really that different to how it has been in france tbh . 
  i think we 'd rather just ban any ferry routes from calais if he plays silly games like this . 
  is there demand for that - in which countries ? 
  eu migration is a hot topic , but i 've not seen the other aspects of the single market so disliked . 
  they 're mostly very experienced people at my company who are either semi-retired or work for themselves the rest of the time and therefore they want to work flexibly on a project-by-project basis . 
  they 'll generally be giving high-level advice and being paid significantly more per-hour than if they worked for us full-time . 
  i know there are a lot of really bloody awful zero hours jobs out there , but not every one is like that . 
  i 'm suggesting how the eu could have been made good enough that we would n't have wanted to leave . 
  i know people on very good ( # 50 + / hr ) zero hour contracts and some on minimum wage . 
  it 's a mixed bag like most jobs . 
  it 's a fundamental part of the legal structure that has been created but it 's not as if it 's some natural law . 
  it 's just what was decided upon at the time . 
  however , it 's had severe negative effects ( even if just politically rather than economically ) on both the sources and the destinations of migrants . 
  it 's time for a more sensible and controlled approach before it does any more political damage . 
  simple controls on migration . 
  obviously not goods and services . 
  i did n't say it would be easy , but i think the eu needs to loosen up in some areas to survive more than a few more years . 
  letting countries take more control of their borders would be a very good start . 
  they * can * be rewritten . 
  the eu is not immutable . 
  if it was , it would have died already . 
   america , russia , saudi , and china america and china , sure we 're dwarfed by them . 
  the other two ? 
  lol . 
  ksa has less power than ever , as evidenced by the fall in oil price . 
  unless you plan on reclaiming land right out to kent then we 're never going to feel as close to the rest of europe as you guys do . 
  then let 's make a stand against fom - we 've tried and failed , so it 's your turn . 
  russians mostly . 
  only irish guy i have an actual problem on here is / u/collectiveindividual - rest of you seem pretty sound . 
  and the uk trades less and less with the eu . 
  congratulations , you 've just used a brexiter argument !, 
  no drop since the referendum or the oil price crash which is the period we were considering . 
  yes , the budget did fall in the past , in line with the rest of the uk , but not during the relevant period and certainly not `` less and less each year '' . 
   ** could ** fall  worst-case scenario you wrote about reduced funding which simply has n't happened . 
  yet . 
  happy to revisit this in the future if this think tank 's predictions become reality , but what you wrote is not true . 
  this sub is fickle and would collapse without an enemy . 
  less and less ? 
  it 's been pretty static , despite the massive reduction in revenues in scotland . 
  sturgeon would deny being a brit . 
  i think you spelled wastemonster wrong !, 
  this sounds rather like a brexiter argument !, 
  hahaha , we are not isolationist . 
  this meme is ridiculous . 
  the money has been good for europe as a whole , but it would ( selfishly ) have been better spent at home . 
  we have less developed regions which need the funding . 
  the single market is about removing non-tariff barriers . 
  it would be possible to have a single market without free movement , it would simply be a single market in one less area . 
  same with the uk tbh . 
  i do n't expect russia to attack us , but to chomp away at eastern europe . 
  however , they are our allies and we will protect them . 
  you will sit back and watch . 
  is russia not a threat ? 
  if not , then there 's no need for an eu army !, 
  that 's fine , i 'm just saying that * less * integration would be preferred by a huge number of people . 
  it 's a question of balance ; do you : a ) want a big eu that 's loosely integrated b ) want a small eu that 's an centralised entity with few powers for members really it 's more of a spectrum , but you get the picture . 
  you * can * insist on deep integration , but you 'll shrink the eu at the same time which may not be worth it for you . 
  i get your position , you live in a less developed country that would get a relatively huge sum of money thrown at it by countries like mine if you joined . 
  surely you would rather the eu stayed large enough to give you large subsidies ? 
  we have to protect your skies from russian incursions ffs . 
  it 's quite confusing , but there is a single market for * some * services , just not across the board . 
  qualifications in one country are not recognised in others etc. 
  you 're talking about a single market for workers . 
  that 's one type . 
  we could easily just have a single market for goods alone if we wanted !, 
  i honestly do n't expect ireland to bother with defence for decades . 
  you like others paying for your defence . 
  i think nato is much more important for peace and stability . 
  what was needed a half century ago is not necessarily what is needed today . 
  i do n't think we 're suddenly going to start fighting because we 've left !, 
  still no true single market for services . 
  should we stop calling the single market the single market ? 
  i 'm not saying that they 'd prefer it to the eu , but that it would have broader support across the whole of europe . 
  they 'd want * this option * *** and more *** . 
  at the moment its ** is ** very much tilted the other way . 
  we lose out on both counts with huge immigration ** and ** huge trade deficit . 
  it would be a single market , just not the same as the one you want .
