  it does n't * have * to be and they can change their minds . 
  it would be in everyone 's best interest . 
   that 's unlike switzerland and norway , who are essentially eu members except in name because they accept freedom of movement and union legislation . 
  these altered memberships were a bespoke solution to the fact that these countries were n't happy with eu membership . 
  the eu will not like this idea at first , but if once the uk has left there is economic damage on both sides i think they could work towards such a solution ( i.e. 
  membership but without fom ) . 
  how can we have fun doing something that we wo n't ever do ? 
  please provide a ** source ** . 
  some do say that , but not generally on this sub . 
  i just do n't think they 're somehow better than us . 
  he believes it should be . 
  he certainly feels very patriotic about the eu and believes that those outside of it are inferior . 
  it may have been , but it 's a long time since it was as low as you suggested . 
  also , when was our contribution as low 10.7 % of the eu budget ? 
  he 's not post-nationalist . 
  he 's an eu nationalist . 
   the thing is , for european developed countries like the uk , germany , france , nl and so on , the single-market which include free-trade of goods is the carrot , the diamond , the purpose of being in the union . 
  ( as well as forcing us to cooperate instead of making war at each others ) . 
  i do n't think this is wrong and i believe that if the single market was more flexible and did n't require fom then the uk would be happy to go along with it . 
   which explain why those countries pay a fee to help eastern countries to catch up . 
  we get this , but it is still a fair amount of money that could maybe be spent at home . 
  sure , we help eu countries catch up but this also seems to be self-harm for the uk as our trade balance with the eu gets worse . 
   if you do not take your part of responsabilities , then no free-trade deals should be offered to you untill you agree for a annual fee , like other countries in europe with such a deal . 
  no , there is no non-single-market country that pays the eu for a fta . 
  ceta does not include this and neither does any other trade deal . 
   but in order to have such a deal , you need first to settle the exit . 
  and the bill of what you owe to the eu . 
  the brexit is a divorce , an exit , not a trade deal . 
  a trade deal will be dealt with once the uk is properly out of the eu and a third-party state . 
  there is no incentive to pay $ 100bn . 
  if we got single-market minus fom in perpetuity then maybe it would be worth it , but this is a * negotiation * where the eu wants a huge amount of money , but has n't yet said what it could offer in exchange . 
  negotiations require give and take . 
  this * may * all be just bluster , let 's hope so . 
  he comes from an insignificant speck of a country and has entirely thrown his lot in with the eu . 
  he wants the eu to be a power in its own right and to throw its weight around . 
  this is very different to politicians from proper countries that are in the eu where they simply want the best for their citizens . 
  the agreement can be done by qmv . 
   it shall be concluded on behalf of the union by the council , acting by a qualified majority , after obtaining the consent of the european parliament . 
  i wonder if that agreement can include the status quo ? 
  i think that was a huge mistake by tony . 
  again , i see it as a government playing politics doing something for their own benefit . 
  labour saw eu migration as great because migrants usually voted labour . 
  this should have been recognised by the eu and we should have been allowed to implement the same block that others did but at a later date . 
  i retract my point that it 's `` in '' the article . 
  but i must point out that the bit about a49 is for countries that have * left * . 
  we have not left yet so its a grey area . 
  that said , if all 28 members decided the uk should stay , then that 's exactly what would happen . 
  we do n't get as much money out because the founding members made the common agricultural policy a key part of the eu , where it spends almost half its budget . 
  rather than reduce the cap we negotiated for a rebate which balanced things out . 
  really it would have been better if all countries who lose out to cap ( basically anywhere densely populated ) forced the eu to greatly reduce its cap spend . 
   if you think the eu is a chance to receive as much money as possible with as little contribution of your own then i am glad your country left . 
  you 'll be very disappointed when you realise that all countries are like this . 
  i 'm sure poland would quit immediately if its subsidies were discontinued . 
   til : to a brexiteer , accepting the reality of the size and power difference between the uk and eu = `` bowing down '' . 
  that is the problem for these negotiations in a nutshell . 
  i 'm responding to this particular comment :  sooner or later , ** you will agree to everything we ask ** . 
  you are in no position to make any demands . 
  it can take 15 years of tarifs if needed . 
  beggars do n't be choosers . 
  it 's * definitely * legally possible if all members agree to it . 
  ( that 's actually * in * the article ) . 
  it * may * be legally possible for the uk to unilaterally extend the negotiations by parliament blocking it ( article 50 says that a country must leave * only * under its own constitutional requirements ) . 
  we do n't yet know if this argument holds any water or not . 
   as juncker says , there a  50 % chance talks will collapse . 
  and he 's clearly willing this to happen . 
  plenty of leaders basically said they 'd be happy to reverse the whole thing if we * actually * changed our minds . 
  not that there 's a danger of that happening . 
  no , what they were trying to block was the uk government extending negotiations beyond the two years . 
  not particularly . 
  we made a great deal with ireland ( with cta etc ) and it still has n't made the north think leaving would be a good idea !, 
  we 're not asking for any `` benefits '' ( which the uk decided were n't worth the asking price ) , just asking for a reasonable free trade deal like the eu is seeking with most countries on earth . 
  we will not bow down to imperialists like yourself . 
  we are not beggars . 
  but that market has a huge trade surplus with us . 
  it benefits the reu much more than the uk . 
  yes mate , i 've looked at the figures and produced them in previous threads . 
  france is a great comparison as we 're basically identical in terms of population and gdp . 
  you 've linked me to gross figures , try taking one away from the other . 
  you 'll see that in terms of net contributions france spends ( 0.89-0 .65  ** 0.24 % gdp ** , while the uk spends ( 0.64-0 .37  ** 0.27 % gdp ** . 
  this actually varies over time , but i looked at the last ten years of figures and the uk and france are basically neck and neck throughout . 
  feel free to say that france and the uk get a good deal , but do n't pretend what we have is particularly outside the norm . 
  i 'm not that surprised . 
  the eu is acting like a tribe as you say , or perhaps an imperial force . 
  this was to be expected , but completely blows the narrative that the eu is an enlightened benevolent organisation right out of the water . 
  i know about the rebate . 
  it puts us level with france , which does much better out of the cap than the uk does . 
  this means we have a normal deal , not a special deal . 
  how did we have the best deal ? 
  you do n't think donald tusk , upon receiving the a50 letter , saying he wishes we 'd voted to remain counts ? 
  the fact is most leaders would love the process to be reversed , but they 're stuck going down this path now . 
  for poland , sure . 
  and if we say that the uk has been * investing * , surely we can upon leaving divest and get a huge sum of money !, 
  mate , we 're just leaving now . 
  the time for sticks and carrots is over , but the eu still wants us to go `` oh shit , let 's cancel that ' . 
  a mutually beneficial deal is what we need . 
  they were still saying it just after a50 activation . 
  it does n't really feel that way as a massive net contributor . 
  cameron tried to get a deal on migrants but we were basically ignored . 
  far from magic , it 's a result of the eu 's behaviour . 
  they want us to remain , but they want to use a stick not a carrot .
