  the uk did n't need southern irish independence to be a success . 
  we could have cut all ties , but actually its best to work together , as we will with the eu . 
  eventually . 
  what contract have we broken !, 
  when did we do that !? 
  we 're just leaving a voluntary union that we joined for trade reasons . 
  unfortunately the deal the uk was offered was n't to the liking of the british people because it did n't address their concerns . 
  does n't have to be like this . 
  the eu is great at creating compromise like the efta / norway option . 
  if they could find a way to offer membership without fom then it would be great  . 
   as a remainer who does n't like may at all , i 'm definitely now understanding her point about no deal being better than a bad one . 
  i 'm surprised that anybody ever thought otherwise . 
  i guess they all believed the enlightened eu would offer a fair deal . 
  the only court they could take us to is one we actually have a * veto * at . 
  what great achievements do germany have that we do n't ? 
  they currently have a slightly better economy than us , but that 's about it . 
  the eu has responsibility for the economic stability of the eu . 
  at the moment it appears that they are neglecting this . 
  the common view on here is that the eu are enlightened and forward thinking and the uk is wanting to have its cake and eat it . 
  of course the reality is that they 're more alike than most want to believe . 
  our net contribution is more like # 8.6 bn or more than $ 10bn . 
  would it ? 
  these are not government bonds . 
  we keep our word . 
  i 've not really noticed it tbh . 
  petrol did initially go up , but then it came back down again . 
   how did the local tabloids spin that one ? 
  we 've always had [ `` rip-off britain '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rip-off_britain ) anyway . 
  i do n't buy from the apple app store , so i do n't know . 
  not noticed anything change on google play . 
  i think phones seem pricier perhaps , but i 'm going to wait another year before i buy a new one . 
  denial was ages ago . 
  that was just after the referendum when people seemed to think it could all be reversed !, 
  most remainers are at stages 4 or 5 , with / r/unitedkingdom split between 3 and 4 . 
  and while we 're at it : ** how has brexit affected your life and what do you think about it ? 
  ** it has n't really . 
  just caused a few heated discussions . 
  i do rather doubt it 's unique to us , but it 's far from universal . 
  the traditional point of view is more `` it 's ok , i suppose '' . 
  i doubt that would happen . 
  it 's possible , but unnecessary . 
  we will have freedom of movement across the british isles . 
  there will be no payments if the eu is not offering something of equivalent value . 
  what price does south korea pay for the deal with the eu , and why is it disproportionate more beneficial to the eu at the expense of south korea ? 
  if south korea can negotiate his trade deals , so can we . 
  it 's not simply a matter of `` biggest wins '' . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  understandable , to an extent , but the eu would do better to make eu membership more attractive to more affluent countries than try to punish those who leave . 
  at the moment the balance is very much towards being great for poor countries and pretty mixed for rich countries . 
  the eu funding in ni is minuscule compared to the # 10bn a year subsidy the uk provides . 
  does n't seem likely as plenty of nationalists live in ni and do n't seem to have an unstoppable urge to move en-mass to the roi . 
  access to one of the two main financial centres on the planet ? 
  regardless , there will be a deal and it will be fair . 
  it 's certainly less of a tweak than brexit !, 
  it would only be a small tweak to the rules and it would be done fairly ( brits would also lose right of fom ) . 
  i 'm still amazed at how inflexible eu countries are on this point . 
  i do n't see how we 're a threat . 
  we just want a good trading relationship and to be good neighbours . 
  threat to integrity ? 
  which have a significant amount of european kit inside of them . 
  fifteen percent of each f35 is british for example . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  if they want a good deal , they also have to offer a good deal . 
  nah , we 'll just invent a # 60bn bill for ireland to pay !, 
  i know that . 
  and i do blame them . 
  it was a very stupid decision by labour . 
  however , i think in recognition of how open we 've been in the past , we should be allowed an exemption from fom if we desire . 
  i 'm not necessarily against a deeper union , but it would need to offer something to us . 
  at present i think the eu takes a lot more from us than it gives . 
  well , the contract ( see article 50 ) says that the treaties ( our contractual obligations ) cease to apply after leaving . 
  i do n't think it 's actually that unreasonable of us to pay their pensions , but i do believe they should have been contributory which would have made this a complete non-issue . 
  if it 's not , then it 's simply something we 're a member of , and after leaving we owe nothing . 
  key here is ** eu ** officials . 
  that 's what negotiation is . 
  we let the eu cherry pick a few things from the uk in return for cherry picking a few things from the eu . 
  again you 're missing the point . 
  if it was a ** non-issue ** then europe would be happy for us to have an exception ( and anyone else who wanted the same ) . 
  clearly making european wars undesirable through the widening of economic ties made sense , but that 's not the same as a near-federal union . 
   no actually it is n't as most countries allow in a fair amount of unskilled workers . 
  we have plenty at present . 
   the usa does that for mexicans fairly limited , otherwise there would n't be so many illegal immigrants . 
   uk did that post war from the empire/commonwealth . 
  yes , after a devastating war , in a time where we needed to rebuild . 
   even australia allows plenty of unskilled workers in . 
  so to say that it is just skilled workers is n't true . 
  i expect the numbers will be very limited . 
  it will be nice for the electorate to have the choice with have a government that will not have its hands tied by eu fom . 
   it is not up to the eu but to individual member states how it is implemented but what is n't up for negotiation is freedom of movement its self . 
  freedom of movement does n't imply being reliant on agncey workers or allowing them to claim benefits . 
  as such it is the fault of the uk gouvernment for not implementing it to the extent of say france or germany . 
  the uk government tried . 
  unfortunately the eu law is not suited to the differences between the systems in germany ( contribution based ) and uk ( residency based ) . 
  there was some progress on that with cameron 's ( mostly shit ) deal , but it should have been that way from the start . 
   all that means the uk ca n't remain in the single market . 
  this will means that there will be some economic loss as the single market is the most comprehensive trade deal there is as such do n't expect to find a better one with freedom of movement . 
  the single market was n't working that well for us . 
  we have a huge trade deficit with the single market . 
  i expect future trade deals to be more balanced . 
  my point is not that ** iff ** freedom of movement was a `` non-issue '' , then the eu would n't enforce it .
