every economy in the world in inter-connected . 
  you do n't send help to every financial problem in the world . 
  if denmark was in a similar situation to greece , then denmark would n't receive a bailout for the simple reason that it is not in the eurozone . 
  since bailouts are only for eurozone countries , it seems fair that only eurozone countries contribute to the bailouts . 
   it 's a union . 
  members are supposed to fix each other 's fuck ups . 
  this is a fuck up for the eurozone , not the eu as a whole . 
   norway is an example of a country that reaps in trade agreement benefits but does n't hold any obligations in return , i do n't think that 's very admirable . 
  norway would not receive a bailout if its economy went like greece 's , so it seems silly for ask them for obligations, 
  why ? 
  it was a bailout to save the eurozone , we 're not part of the eurozone and have no intention of joining it . 
  the ecb and the european bailout fund are there for the eurozone , so only countries in the eurozone should be contributing to it . 
  the uk already is a net contributor even with the rebate . 
  the rebate is to cancel out the common agricultural policy , which is essentially a french rebate . 
  the eurozone bailout fund can only be accessed by eurozone countries , so it seems fair that only eurozone countries pay into it . 
  [ yeah , it 's a bit worrying .

  we won the first test match in this year 's ashes by 169 runs . 
  i 'm going to disagree with you there . 
  i mainly drink at student bars , so everything is cheap , but there 's little choice . 
  guinness is one of the few beers available that is n't coors light or budweiser type of beers . 
  the problem with guinness is that it has trouble with travelling distances . 
  so , sometimes it will be nice , sometimes , not so nice . 
   when i moved to the us and took a couple of history classes , i was kind of annoyed by how little relevance is given to italy in the context of ww2 . 
  according to the textbooks i had to study here in the us , ww2 is presented as a `` germans and japs vs the world '' , with italy playing a minimal and somewhat caricaturist role in the background . 
  that sounds similar to how i was taught history , except with the role of japan being minimalized as well . 
  in fact , mussolini came up more when i was learning about the domestic history of the uk than from learning about ww2 itself . 
  nato needs to be strong . 
  sure , no one in nato is likely to come under direct attack from another nation in the near future , but you ca n't possibly predict what 's going to happen 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , etc. 
  years down the line . 
  in 1919 , some people thought world peace was assured for good because they had the league of nations and look how well that turned out . 
  i 'm not saying we 're going to have another world war , but we ca n't predict what nato 's militaries will be needed for in the future . 
  english and welsh , this data does n't include scotland or northern ireland . 
  now you get the idea . 
  you french people do throw insults back as well , it 's not just one way . 
  it 's perfectly fine . 
  england and france are 2 countries that are free to insult each other without anyone sensible getting offended . 
   he average british anti-european is not any more anti-german as he is anti-french a lot of people are anti-french , but that has nothing to do with politics , it 's just fun . 
   once again the un confirms itself as totally useless and dysfunctional ... what exactly were you expecting from the un ? 
  isle of man :  1 drunk 1 always 1 danes, 
  very funny , but [ it 's much more complicated than that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbvtdlttlte ) . 
  he did n't do a [ nick robinson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd4dw2eb9ck ) though , 
  i would just like to point out that you have essentially described the deal that 's currently in place for a lot of the eu 's special member state territories . 
  i do n't think we should be allowed to keep eu citizenship if we leave , but i 'm just pointing that out . 
  so is tunisia . 
  and i bet you 10 greek euros they 'll call it the `` greek euro '' . 
  no matter which way this vote had gone , greece would be in a terrible position regardless . 
  they 're dammed now it appears they 've voted no and they would be dammed if they 'd voted yes . 
  putting a nations economy at risk for pure ideological reasons is not worth it . 
  the problem with polls for elections in the uk is the voting system skews the results , so unless you were to hold 650 polls for each constituency , they would n't be very accurate . 
  with this referendum in greece however , there are 2 options and the % age of people who vote no will be the result for no and the % age of people who vote yes will be the result for yes . 
  why are the channel islands and the isle of man grey ? 
  * maths, 
  so according to yahoo , a person who thinks the equator passes through europe is a person who 's opinion on the eu should be taken seriously . 
  what 's wrong with not using the euro ? 
  the met office have released 2 weather warning for tomorrow for where i am . 
  one of them is for high uv levels and the other is for heavy rain . 
  make your fucking minds up !, 
  that 's true , however it 's all owed to the banks and i do n't care about bankers . 
  til / s, 
  cyprus ? 
  it actually makes more sense than you would think . 
  it would mean there would be less of a burden on the greek economy and it might give it a chance to grow and when it does grow , they can pay it back through trade , when their people have enough money to buy all those cars your country makes . 
  still , it 's not like anyone ever did something like that for germany ... [ oh wait .

  but she does n't have the title `` queen of england '' , she 's the `` queen of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' . 
  out of the free movement of goods , services , capital and people , he agrees with three and a half of them, 
  well , the only place in mainland europe where she 's the monarch of is gibraltar , which despite her [ long list of titles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_titles_and_honours_of_queen_elizabeth_ii ) , is one of the few places where she does n't have a specific title . 
  in gibraltar , she is just elizabeth windsor .

  why would you make bread that shape ? 
   if we were talking about italy or sweden or even ireland - i 'm all for war to keep them in if history has taught us anything , it 's that wars to stop the irish leaving cause more harm than good .

  but then the farmer would start to ask questions about what you were doing with his cow . 
  best just to kill it whilst the farmer 's not there . 
  step 1 ) buy the bread , preferably a bun . 
  step 2 ) cut the bun in 2 . 
  step 3 ) find a cow . 
  step 4 ) ask the cow nicely if it 'll get inside the bun . 
  step 5 ) kill the cow once it refuses .
