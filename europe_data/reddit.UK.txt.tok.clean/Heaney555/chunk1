its no secret that more than 70 % of imigrants are young men your ass is not a reliable source of data . 
  '' * regarding the gender distribution of immigrants to the eu member states in 2013 , there were slightly more men than women ( *** 53 % ** * compared with 47 % ) . 
  the member state reporting the highest share of male immigrants was slovenia ( 61 % ) * '' source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/migration_and_migrant_population_statistics ( the last year with full data is 2013 ), 
  from the same article : * http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/17/20/2a9fc32b00000578-0-image-a-7_1437162370267.jpg * http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/17/20/2a9fcf6500000578-0-image-a-6_1437162300418.jpg * http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/17/20/2aa22ad600000578-0-image-a-3_1437161983569.jpg if you 're so easily influenced by a single image , then * you 're * the one being fed bullshit . 
  there are any number of reasons why that single image showed only men . 
  they could have been outside organising things while the women and children were already onboard ( sexist to say , but it 's true in many cultures ) or separated from the women for religious/cultural reasons . 
   unless putin is up to some serious diabolical comic book villain level shit and nuking planes actually both the us and soviet union used nuclear warheads in their earliest surface to air missiles , right up through the 60 's and early 70 's . 
  it 's not absurd at all . 
  ( they were so inaccurate that nuclear warheads were the only chance of `` hitting '' the target aircraft ) . 
  no it is n't , the s-300 is , by far . 
  there are more s-300 tels than every other type of air defence vehicle in the russian armory combined . 
  of course you 're only a lowly anti-tank missile , so you would n't know that . 
   after the ad hom it 's frustration expressed that i have to waste my time explaining basic missile warfare theory to commentors who learned most of their knowledge from fucking video games , movies , and wikipedia . 
   apart from that , i find your assertions that `` x can intercept y '' rather presumptuous as long as those anti-missile systems have n't been tested in anger except they have , during the iraq war ( 2003 ) the mim-104d was used extensively and had a 100 % success rate against scud missiles . 
  but why does `` in anger '' matter ? 
  there have been hundreds of tests of ram , essm , sm-2 , sm-6 and sm-3 !, 
  one of the reasons the us defence budget is so high is that they test * the fuck * out of everything . 
  the us declares a weapon `` operational '' about 3 years after russia/china would , because in that time they test and fix the bugs over hundreds of tests . 
   i 'm sure that air defence frigates have advanced since the days they could n't tell apart an airbus from a tomcat , but intercepting a fast missile , never mind a volley of them , remains a very tall order . 
  yes . 
  they have . 
  just as you 've gone from having a # 5000 pc the size of a sofa that could play pong and word process to a 1440p smartphone with more processing power than a supercomputer of 10 years ago in your personal life - missile interception technology has advanced at the same pace . 
  the systems of 30 years ago would never intercept a missile . 
  i completely agree there . 
  but sm-3 and sm-6 each flew less than 5 years ago . 
  they would rank easily in the top 10 most impressive technology we humans have ever made ( and yes , that 's sad that it 's a weapons system , even a defensive one ) . 
  to me , it 's simply bizarre that you could have ( as you claim ) be reading articles on this and come to the conclusion `` i still do n't believe that missiles can intercept missiles '' . 
  aegis today is penetrable * only * by volume of fire . 
  you over-saturate by firing enough missiles rapidly enough that the ships simply can not react in time . 
  but each ship added makes that harder , and a carrier group will have enough to prevent * billions of dollars of incoming missiles * ( yes , i 've seen that in reports , not just coming out of my ass ) . 
  in fact , since our original point was about cost : * it would cost more in missiles to take out a carrier defended by escorts than to build the carrier in the first place * . 
   i must add that you are straying from your original point . 
  even if the us or an allied nation had the anti-missile capability to intercept advanced anti-ship missiles and protect a carrier group ( which is debatable ) no it is n't debatable . 
  honestly . 
  any analyst worth their weight in peanuts knows that modern iads are highly capable of defeating anti-ship missiles , in the same way that any biologist worth * theirs * knows that evolution happened . 
  just because a few fringe analysts disbelieve in missile defence/evolution , does n't make it valid or `` debatable '' . 
   that does n't mean that russia , china , india or brazil also have it all of those nations have comparable missiles to the standard series . 
  they lack anti- * ballistic * missile capability ( but none of their enemies even have anti-ship ballistic missiles ) , but anti-ship cruise missile defence is mature in * all * of the nations you mentioned . 
   getting aircraft carriers without the effective ability to protect them seems about the dumbest way to spend your money i can think of which is why they do n't . 
  they protect a carrier with effective point and area defence . 
   finally , the thing about the missile vs. missile defence wager is that the stakes are so unbalanced . 
  one side is betting a single missile , while the other side is betting an aircraft carrier , or even a carrier group the `` stakes '' are irrelevant . 
  they have nothing to worry about , the cost of intercept and production are effectively the same . 
  honestly , unless an enemy throws * literally billions of dollars * of missiles at them in one attack , a us carrier group in 2015 is impenetrable . 
   he fact that aircraft carriers these days ca n't go anywhere without a full complement of aam frigates and asw destroyers , plus the corresponding supply vessels , is already damning enough as it is why is that damning ? 
  just as you have to protect your artillery on land , or escort your bombers in the air , you have to protect the aircraft carrier - a highly vulnerable target on its own , but with * massive * offensive capabilities . 
   if the missile is intercepted , the attacker can launch another one ( or a dozen of them ) the cost of intercept is equal to the cost of the missile , as of 2015 . 
  neither side has a resource advantage - except that the defender can carry far more defensive missiles than the attacker can offensive . 
  you seem to have been again ignoring all of the facts . 
  a key requirement of the sm-3 is ** exactly that ** , the ability to function completely without satellite assistance . 
  the sm-3 can be guided only with the networked ship and land based radars , and -- but * the absolute irony * of your comment is that the df-21d 's huge weakness is that ** it ** ca n't !, 
  it completely requires a complex network of satellites to guide it . 
   except , perhaps , the df-21d nope . 
  completely intercept able by an sm-3 . 
   or the klub even an sm-2 or sm-6 can take out a klub . 
  nothing special about it . 
   quite frankly , on any missile vs. missile defence arms race , my bets are on the missile ... well your bets are wrong . 
  i have written defence analysis articles for the very missiles you 're mentioning , and i assure you the missile defence is still in the lead for now . 
  yes , i read about this for years and have read detailed analysis articles . 
  for me it 's not just another clickbait reddit thread - i actually know what i 'm talking about . 
  they are n't rushing to procure a local carrier , they 've * already built it * . 
  and it 's been the plan all along to develop indigenous carrier , it 's not a reaction . 
  you are a layman commenting on a topic you should n't be . 
  your comment shows a total ignorance of modern naval warfare . 
  missile defences ( phalanx , sm-2er , ram , essm , sm-6 , sm-3 ) have kept up perfectly well with modern anti-ship missiles . 
  a carrier never sails alone , it is always escorted by enough cruisers and destroyers to intercept any and all anti-ship missiles heading for the carrier . 
  a modern us navy destroyer carries around 112 missiles , most of which are purely for this task . 
  russia , china , india and any other country with brains still want carriers because their power projection and strike capabilities are unmatched . 
  point defence is handled by escorts and area defence is handled by the mig-29ks . 
  western carriers have very * little * point defence anyways ( and no area defence ) , so it 's not as much of a deal as you 're making out . 
  and again - far far better than * no * carrier in 2015 ( or , well , * ever * ) , such as the german navy . 
   that 's to be seen . 
  the first ship of the class has already been built . 
  within cost requirements . 
  it 's just in testing and training . 
  you realise this is a `` looking back '' style article ? 
  this was a cost issue , not quality issue , and in 3 years the indian navy will be introducing an indigenous carrier that has had none of these cost issues ( though they 're still keeping this one , because there 's nothing wrong with it , and in fact it 's a great carrier ) . 
  to me , you sound bitter that your country has no aircraft carrier while all the brics except south africa do . 
  [ and the same thing if you want a 5th generation fighter ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/india-is-not-happy-with-fifth-generation-fighter-2014-6?ir=t ) . 
  variable-wing aircraft are a type of fixed-wing aircraft . 
  the other type than fixed-wing is rotary wing . 
  they 'd be considered ( manned ) cruise missiles if used in modern warfare . 
  rockets and machineguns , just not in that photo . 
  norway has only 500,000 more people than ireland , and has just over 50 f-16s in service . 
  finland has 750,000 more and has just over 60 f/a -18 s in service . 
  denmark has 1,000,000 more and has just under 40 f-16s in service . 
  to be perfectly honest , i expect ireland to have about 10 f-16s , yes . 
  maybe even just 5 , but at least * something * . 
  ireland is kind of just piggybacking on the uk 's air defences . 
   russian bombers come equipped with active radars , no ? 
  not really , no . 
  they have navigation radars and some have shipping radars , but not radars meant to detect fighters . 
  none . 
  combat aircraft simply means an aircraft that is * capable * of firing against an enemy . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mid-air_collision#list_of_notable_civilian_mid-air_collisions remember that what has lowered this drastically is modern air traffic control ... ... but the russians have their transponders turned off , and do not file flight plans . 
  aircraft used to collide all the time before tcas and transponders . 
  it 's a very real possibility , even for trained pilots . 
  it 's * supposed * to be a trainer , but the irish air corps uses it as their only combat aircraft . 
  oh i know . 
  i meant the reality of ireland 's own air defence capabilities .
