  or dprcm for short . 
  ** day 33 ** the dprcm have declared that the railways , post office , and freddos company are all to be nationalized effective immediately . 
  they managed to get a list of the tory membership and are currently rounding up the last 180,000 tories they have evidence against . 
  they will be tried by a jury of their peers , who just happen to be poor disabled people . 
  ** day 38 ** the dprcm have seemingly overplayed their hand by attempting to kick out the queen from buckingham palace and convert the building into low cost housing for nurses and teachers . 
  the dprcm have appointed jeremy corbyn as supreme leader to unite the party towards a common goal of equality and fairness for all . 
  ** day 39 ** the dprcm has split into 3 factions . 
  the dprcm , the dprcm but please leave queenie alone party , and the give back the falklands party which consists solely of jeremy corbyn . . 
  the trials have gone well and are one of the few things the 3 factions can agree on . 
  97 % of the tory membership have been summarily executed for ` crimes against humanity and also my mates mum who has me and totally ca n't work , but the dwp said she could . ', 
  the other 3 % have been sentenced to 10 years hard living in a council estate . 
  with prole . 
  ** day 55 ** tony blair has been found living in a hole in bognor . 
  a fantastic pr coup for the dprcm-gbtfp coalition government . 
  a royal rumble at wembely arena has been organised whereby all the royals will fight to the death . 
  the winner will fight tony blair to the death . 
  ant and dec have been announced as hosts . 
  ** day 85 ** cracks have started to show in the coalition government . 
  the announcement of plans to build 650 million council houses has come as a shock to many citizens . 
  after much negotiation the number was revised down to 600 million council houses , and the bill passed . 
  fyi , he was n't in a uniform but he was wearing a ` help the heroes ' hoodie and was targeted specifically because they thought he was a soldier . 
  they 'd been driving around for a while looking for someone , apparently . 
  ` shit guys , they 've broken out the memes . 
  do our ak47 's penetrate memes ? 
  oh , they do ? 
  never mind then . 
  we 're good . 
  carry on . ', 
  clearly not read my other comments in this thread if you think i 'm an apologist . 
  either that or you think anyone who does n't want to kill all muslims is an apologist . 
   what , and mass spread discrimination against an ethnic and religious group is n't also a serious issue ? 
  it 's always overhyped though . 
  an attempt to divert attention away from the real issues that underpin this wave of home grown terrorism europe is seeing . 
  [ for example , this story reported widely just a week after the paris attacks . . ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/paris-attacks-british-muslims-face-300-spike-in-racial-attacks-in-week-following-terror-a6744376.html ) however the data was gathered by the charity ` tell mama ' , who [ had their funding withdrawn by the government 3 years ago after they were caught out lying and using poor methodology to claim attacks on muslims had risen after lee rigby ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-gilligan/10108098/muslim-hate-monitor-to-lose-backing.html ) . . 
  the media are always so desperate to make us feel guilty , that they 'll completely overlook the source of their facts . 
  as long as it fits their narrative , it gets printed . 
  it 's annoying . 
  set a google alert for ` tell mama ' and wait for your inbox to fill up in about a week . 
  but it diverts attention away from the actual issue . 
  people attempting to shoehorn the eu referendum into this story will get bitched at , yet it 's okay to report that someone on twitter said ` fuck muslims ' as if that 's at all news worthy in comparison to people getting blown the fuck up . 
  a double standard at play , imo . 
  well you 're off to a bad start . 
  lee rigby was n't actually beheaded . 
  they ran him over and then stabbed at his neck for a bit . 
  it was an attempted beheading , which i think is an important distinction to make when you 're criticizing the actions of bystanders . 
  lots of people had no idea what was going on . 
  they ran him over with a car first , and all the witnesses said they thought it was a standard road accident until the guy started ranting about islam . 
  anyway , what are you exactly complaining about when it comes to lee rigby ? 
  the two guys were shot , arrested , and are now in jail for the rest of their lives . 
  that 's a pretty good outcome to the entire ordeal . 
  also , i personally do n't consider that a terrorist attack . 
  it was at most a politically motivated murder . 
  i know some people will disagree with that , but for me a terrorist attack has to be indiscriminate in nature . 
  the fact they targeted lee rigby specifically kind of discounts it as a terrorist attack . 
   by at least tomorrow the story of a savage ` backlash ' ( consisting mainly of stares and horrible things written on social media ) will be being talked-up by all mainstream muslim leaders . 
  fuck , that really does always happen . 
  they paint it as if they 're the real victims here . . not the people that got blown up , or the families of people who got blown up . 
  how has germany remained unscathed ? 
  well our flag is so good looking it 's included in a bunch of other flags soooo . . 
  but when citizens are also the perpetrators . . 
   come and get it right , rally the fucking bannermen . 
  daniel day lewis ? 
  [ possible explanation fo why belgium has become a terrorist hotbed . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/pj_pfuj9wpe?t=18 ), 
  how did the us cause the syria situation ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  not sure about those numbers . 
  should british soldiers be included ? 
  they were n't exactly saints during the troubles . . 
  it says that in 1972 there were 350 + people killed by terrorist attacks . 
  that sounds high even for the troubles . 
  the numbers seem inflated to me . 
  google tells me 644 civilians were killed during the entire troubles , so the only way you could get as many deaths in that graph is if you include soldiers . 
  we do n't count soldiers killed fighting the taliban later on in the graph , so i do n't think we should count soldiers fighting the ira in the lower portion . 
  david cameron got absolutely slated for saying this :  for too long , we have been a passively tolerant society , saying to our citizens : as long as you obey the law , we will leave you alone . 
  it 's often meant we have stood neutral between different values . 
  and that 's helped foster a narrative of extremism and grievance . 
  we 've not had a proper terrorist attack in over a decade , so we 're doing pretty well too . 
  there was that guy that ran over that soldier , but i do n't really count that as a terrorist attack . 
  seemed more like a politically motivated murder of one guy . 
  who had march on the european terrorist attack pool ? 
  pay up everyone !, 
   you jail them for 40 years then send them to any foreign country that accepts their old asses . 
  france : ` hey guys , anyone want an islamic terrorist ? ', 
  entire world : * crickets *, 
   citizenship should be a privilege one can lose if proven unloyal , hostile and dangerous . 
  seems open to abuse . 
  particularly the unloyal part . 
  also , you ca n't legally make someone stateless as far as i know . 
  i thought ` yeah , but who reads the metro ? ', 
  i do n't think police get distracted when a terrorist is caught who said he is part of a planned terrorist attack . . 
   well , the precedent would be you joining the ec . 
  it was n't ` good ' in the levels that you are demanding . 
  rejoining is vastly different to joining . 
  will require a much higher level of public support . 
   what about an economic downturn accompanied with rising levels of unemplyment . 
  ( which is unlikely , i know , but just for the question ) . 
  no , i still do n't think we 'd rejoin . 
  the eu would have to be doing better than us , when we 're doing well ourselves . 
  we 'd never grovel just because our economy is fucked .
