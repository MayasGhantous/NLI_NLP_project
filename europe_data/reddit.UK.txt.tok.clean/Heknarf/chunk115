  it 's meaningless . 
  it 's lazy . 
  my resentment is n't towards the eu , it 's towards crappy arguments on reddit . 
  not saying it 's good news . 
  just saying it 's not ` uk will be 3rd world country lol ' news . 
  pretty sick of the ridiculous bullshit getting perpetuated on this sub about brexit . 
  yes , brexit will almost certainly be economically detrimental to the uk . 
  no , poland will not overtake us in gdp in 5 years time . 
  ( literally had to argue that a few months back on here . . ) getting on my nerves . 
  the same people making these bullshit unsubstantiated claims will then go on to mock brexiters for being ` sick of experts ' as if they have some moral high ground . 
  why do you have to simplify brexit so much ? 
  it 's like describing something complicated using crayons and a fucking puppet . 
  or trying to describe monetary policy using personal finances . 
  brexit is not a divorce between a wife and husband . 
  it 's geopolitics . 
  do you even know what financial passporting actually is ? 
   the pwc report tries to paint a rosy picture it does n't , lmao . 
  you 've clearly not even fucking read it . 
  why not ? 
  that 's basically how all other developed countries do it . 
  the usa does n't require dollar clearing to take place inside the usa . 
  that 's why london clears more dollars than new york city . . 
  you underestimate just how big a financial player we are . 
  as carney said recently we handle 75 % of the eu 's foreign exchange trading , 75 % of its hedging , and half of all lending . .  you ca n't be a financial center for eu . 
  obvously not , because we 'll no longer be in the eu . 
  we 'll still be by far the most important financial services hub in europe , though . 
  and yet , it is . 
  alright , find a better report then . 
  none are going to have our financial services sector shrink by over 70 % , so we 'll remain the most important country in europe when it comes to financial services . 
  https://www.pwc.co.uk/financial-services/assets/leaving-the-eu-implications-for-the-uk-fs-sector.pdf they 've done all the leg work on this . 
  yes , there 's a significant impact . 
  yes , we will still be the most financially relevant country in europe for a long long time . 
  it defends our interests . 
  anyway , you do n't need to think about it too much in detail . 
  it just looks good to tory/ukip voters . 
  you can literally remove eu exports from that figure and we still export over double the next biggest in europe . . and being outside the eu wo n't mean we no longer sell financial services to the eu . 
  it 'll just likely mean we sell less . 
  from mark carney recently :  first , the uk 's financial services sector provides 75 % of foreign exchange trading for the eu , 75 % of all hedging products ( which help businesses insure against risk when making investments or buying products ) and supports half of all lending . 
  as he said in november , the uk is europe 's `` investment banker '' . 
  a sharp break in that liquidity and capacity support could be detrimental to financial stability in the eu . 
  alex brazier , the executive director for financial stability at the bank , said that the uk exports # 26bn of financial services to the eu , and imports just # 3bn . 
  so yeah , vastly . 
  also , [ if you look at the biggest exporters of financial services ] ( http://www.cityam.com/220569/city-leads-uk-top-spot-among-financial-exporters ) the list is : * uk = $ 95bn * usa = $ 36bn * switzerland = $ 24bn * luxembourg = $ 23bn * singapore = $ 15bn * hong kong = $ 13bn you can literally take the two biggest in europe ( only one is even in eu ) that are n't the uk , add them together , then double them , and still not get to the amount the uk exports . . 
  so as i said ... ` by far ' . 
  do you not accept that ireland and the uk have been ideological allies inside the eu ? 
  i 'm not sure that 's technically true . 
  how many french bound aircraft crashed last year ? 
  yeah , it 's kinda a ` no shit ' thing . 
  london will no longer be the financial capital of the eu because ... 
  it 'll no longer be in the eu . 
  it 'll still be by far the most important financial city in europe , though . 
   `` do the hungarians and the poles want exactly the same thing as the germans and the french ? 
  i have serious doubts , '' he said . 
  * [ perfidiousness intensifies ] *, 
  yes , but poland wants a permanent presence . . from the article :  but waszczykowski in bratislava asked for more [ than extra troops ] . 
   `` we expect decisions that change the security status of this region . 
  although we belong to the same institution [ nato ] there are different statuses - a better one in the west and a different one on the so-called eastern flank . 
  there are no troops deployed here permanently , no military facilities owned by nato , '' he said . 
  anyways , just watch ... 
  it 's such an obvious play , and i 'd bet poland has already asked may for this . 
  it 's also politically very easy for may . 
  us brits like our military , and feel its prestige is at an all time low . 
  an extra base in a foreign country would be a political win for a party that claims to be strong on defense . 
  and as i said elsewhere in this thread . . 
  the eu giving the uk a good deal does n't do the eu any harm . 
  it 's win-win for any country that wants to take us up on our offers . 
  they keep their position in the eu , and whatever we bribe them with . 
  so what you 're saying is juncker is n't a realist ? 
  countries positions in the eu are n't at stake , though . 
  no country is going to get kicked out for being kind to us in negotiations . 
  everything to gain , little to lose . 
   note how the resistance to immigration in the uk is generally highest where there are fewest immigrants . 
  [ note how it is almost always highest where the recent % change in immigration is highest . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21701950-areas-lots-migrants-voted-mainly-remain-or-did-they-britains-immigration-paradox )  where foreign-born populations increased by more than 200 % between 2001 and 2014 , a leave vote followed in 94 % of cases . 
  the proportion of migrants may be relatively low in leave strongholds such as boston , in lincolnshire ( where 15.4 % of the population are foreign-born ) . 
  but it has grown precipitously in a short period of time ( by 479 % , in boston 's case ) . 
  high levels of immigration do n't seem to bother britons ; high rates of change do . 
  [ `` the us and germany have unequivocally said that nato will not build new bases in poland , citing tactical and political reasons . 
  '' ] ( https://euobserver.com/foreign/133084 ) less than a year ago . 
  you think trump is * more * likely to allow a nato base in poland ? 
  haha . 
  there 's going to be natural divisions whereby our standard eu allies do n't like the eu 's official stance against us . 
  then there will be new ones we nurture too , likely with bribes of some kind . 
  maybe poland would like a british military base on its eastern border , for example . 
  it 's going to be a hell of a ride . 
  lots of people on this sub are going to get quite upset . 
  immigration is n't a problem , and yet it drove a decent proportion of the uk to vote to remove themselves from the european union . 
  how exactly do you classify ` problem ' , because by any definition of the word that constitutes a problem . 
  does the past matter for the people of the present ? 
  does the government having failed 7 years ago mean no action can be taken today to correct it ? 
  so no , then . 
  no shit . 
  ireland was given a much bigger voice with us inside the eu . 
  it 's not scapegoating . 
  can we control eu immigration now ? 
  today ? 
  this second ? 
  yeeaaah , there comes a point where the eu is n't locking countries out of it 's market . 
  it 's locking itself out of the global market . 
  you lock off london and new york , and you 're now the worldwide outsider .
