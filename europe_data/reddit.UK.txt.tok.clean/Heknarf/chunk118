  that 's just what the snp campaigned on for reelection . 
  it was n't a ` clause ' to the referendum . 
  often people ask for help . 
  until the eu military needs to be used , eu countries start arguing between themselves on whether they should , and it never gets used . 
  if you believe a military should be 100 % defensive , and only used when an eu country is being invaded , then yes it 's possibly a good idea . 
  if you believe it 's sometimes necessary to use your military to protect others , then it 's an awful idea . 
  simply not at all true . 
  she 's tried twice to strike a deal that reciprocal deal . 
  she 's been asking/signalling for such a thing since * july * . . http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/donald-tusk-accuses-british-voters-backed-brexit-creating-anxiety/, 
  just sail the gunboats over to belgium and shell them until the eu give into our demands . 
  like the good old days . 
  we 're not talking about continuing freedom of movement . 
  just letting everyone who took advantage of freedom of movement in the past 40 years , remain in their chosen countries . 
  yes . 
  the negotiation position is ` you let our lads stay , we 'll let your stay . . ' you 're seeing malice where there is none . 
  their statement is ` we will allow eu citizens to stay . ', 
  their qualifier is ` as long as britons are allowed to stay . ', 
  that has been government policy since mid july . 
  theresa may said it * during her campaign to become pm * . . you 're so clueless . 
  fucking political casuals do my nut . 
   they never manage to just say `` we 'll guarantee status if the eu reciprocates '' erm . 
   mrs may had proposed that eu workers currently living in the uk be allowed to remain in exchange for an agreement which gives british expats in the european union the same rights . 
  are you blind ? 
   how on earth would what i said damage the uks negotiating position in any way , unless you have other interests than letting people stay ? 
  the interests are allowing the britons in europe to stay in europe . 
  we 're not going to unilaterally declare all eu citizens can stay , because we 'd be sailing our own nationals who live in the eu down the river . 
  you 're so incredibly uninformed and emotional . 
   `` we 'll secure the status of eu nationals in the uk if the eu reciprocates '' the government has said that literally dozens of times . 
   mrs may had proposed that eu workers currently living in the uk be allowed to remain in exchange for an agreement which gives british expats in the european union the same rights . 
  that was back in november . 
  she 's said it about once a month since she became pm . 
  not even joking . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/donald-tusk-accuses-british-voters-backed-brexit-creating-anxiety/ ), 
   well the british government is blocking pretty much every eu bill just because we can . 
  not remotely true . 
  where does this meme even come from ? 
  nah , i still think it 's probably for the best long term . 
  most germans are safe despite terrorism . . 
  7th may 2015 = $ 1.53 14th may 2015 = $ 1.57 clearly the manifesto pledge meant nothing . 
  and the referendum was announced in feb 2016 . 
  and as noted above , it dipped when the referendum was actually announced , then recovered , then fluctuated a little depending on the daily polls before rallying on the day of the referendum . 
  you 're grasping at straws . 
  there was so much more going on politically and economically than the referendum back in 2015 then . 
  oil was tanking for starters . 
  rbs ( which we own a majority share of ) reported massive losses . 
  there was a lot of shit going on in january . 
  the gbp fell 15 % directly because of brexit . 
  why attempt to sex the figure up by talking utter bollocks ? 
  15 % is a big enough fall as is . 
  and then back down . 
  because nothing would have actually changed . 
  it 'd have been speculators fucking about and making money off nothing . 
  it 'd have gone back to its baseline of ~ $ 1.45, 
   it stings more when you realise the pound was already depressed because of the referendum uncertainty [ well that 's simply not true . 
  ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=usd&amp;view=1y ) january 7 = $ 1.46 february 27 = $ 1.38 may 1 = $ 1.46 june 14 = $ 1.41 june 23 = $ 1.49 july 7 = $ 1.28 jan 5 = $ 1.23 as you can see , after cameron announced the referendum it fell momentarily , then returned to pre-referendum announcement levels before rallying on the day of the referendum , then dropping off the cliff . 
  there 's no evidence to support your claim that it would have risen modestly otherwise . 
  oh , and as of today the 1 year devaluation is smack bang on 15 % . 
  quite far away from the 20 % you claimed . 
  get back to me in april when a50 is invoked . 
  i think it 's lame as fuck that they do n't learn spanish and properly integrate , but we do pay spain for their healthcare . 
  and eu migration drives up property prices in the uk , so fair is fair on that front . 
   empire a european bringing up the empire . 
  3 more and i have / r/europe bingo . 
   reality is , that nobody cares about brexit . 
  that 's obviously not true . 
  but never support their state leaving the united states . 
  weird that . 
  it 's been pretty clear since theresa may took charge that her line in the sand is eu migration . 
  it 's been pretty clear since forever , that that 's also the eu 's line in the sand . . who will blink first ? 
  neither . 
  hence , hard brexit . 
  [ we wo n't be negotiating trade during a50 anyway . 
  michel barnier has said as much . 
  ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/e3644d5e-bba9-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080 ) we 're getting a hard brexit . 
  i do n't understand why i 'm the only one seeing this . . 
  it 's been written on the wall for months now . 
  basically shouted from the rooftops . . 
  it 's no harder . 
  they just ca n't be bothered , probably because they 've only got so much time left . 
  but i think they should learn spanish too . . 
  that 's quite a popular car . 
  maybe it 's because we do n't have a culture we 're attempting to protect . 
  we do n't feel the need to feel ` english ' because we 're the dominant culture regardless on these islands . 
  scotland , wales , ni , ( and ireland too , really ) all kind of sing to our tune . 
  i was talking about buildings . 
  the feel of the place . 
  i 've naturally never been though the scottish school system . . 
  anyway , there 's plenty of other differences too such as scotland having a separate ( but pretty similar ) legal system to england & wales . 
  i just feel these differences are n't enough to make somewhere seem remotely foreign . 
  i 'm not attempting to change your mind , btw . 
  this is just how i feel . 
  you 're the one who asked . . 
  i 'm not telling anyone anything . 
  it 's just my personal feelings . 
  i 'd say the irish definitely hold a special place . 
  separate from britain , of course . 
  but still culturally our most similar by far . 
  there 's no country on earth more similar to the uk than ireland . 
  that 's a really crap tactic . 
   whenever i 've been in a different part of the uk i always an distinctly aware that i am in a different country .
