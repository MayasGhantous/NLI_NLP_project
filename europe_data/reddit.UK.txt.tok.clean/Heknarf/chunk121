  maybe the only way to keep all these different religious extremists from killing each other and civilians is ruling with an iron fist ? 
  a boogeyman more powerful than their god . 
  a saddam , a ghadafi , an assad . . 
  gaddafi literally said as much when he was alive , in 2010 :  `` we should stop this illegal immigration . 
  if we do n't , europe will become black , it will be overcome by people with different religions , it will change '' he was demanding # 4bn to help stop it from happening . 
  instead he got overthrown with western help , then stabbed in the arse until he died . 
  funny how things work out , eh ? 
   ed miliband actually using his brain for once . 
  read : politicked with peoples lives [ george osborne recently gave a pretty good breakdown of why that vote was a slap in the face to western values . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f74hhkqyxo ) we gave up a leading role in syria , which lead to russia taking a leading role . 
  so instead of syria getting our scalpel , syria got a russian sledgehammer . 
  much to its peoples detriment . 
  we still have a lot of sway in terms of foreign policy , as shown when our parliament voted down action in syria , and then obama backed down too . 
  we backed down , the american public ( read : media ) questioned why we did , so the president had to back down too . 
  if we 'd not agreed to go into iraq , public opinion in the usa would have been vastly different from the get go . 
  support would have dropped from high , to medium . 
  it 'd not have changed much , but us going in did validate the decision to a lot of americans . 
   `` the main reason up here voted to go out was racism , '' says lee , a plain-spoken 72-year-old . 
   for instance , lee says , some people resent that a nearby muslim community keeps to itself , but fail to recognize they do it in part for their own protection . 
   `` the irish have done it , the jews have done it , they all live in separate enclaves , '' says lee , nursing a whisky and lemonade . 
  sounds like a failure of multiculturalism . 
  sounds a lot more like parallel societies . 
  obviously voting to leave the eu to stop muslim immigration is beyond stupid , but concern for the creation of parallel societies seems reasonably valid . 
  we 've had issues with it before , even if the government does n't like to admit to it . 
   `` my lasting memory of this polling station was them coming in and saying virtually every time , ` what do we do ? ' '', 
  scott recalled . 
  `` so , we were obviously experiencing people who 'd never ever voted in their lives . '', 
  it seems many people who were disillusioned with the political system that works to suppress their political opinions saw their chance to make themselves heard , and they took it . 
  okay , the specific issue voted on would never limit muslim migration to the uk . 
  but it sends a message about immigration * in general * . 
  i think brexit should be a wakeup call for the establishment . 
  we need proportional representation if we want anything approaching a functioning democracy . 
  otherwise we 'll have this kind of build up of pent up political rage which can explode in unexpected ways . 
  i will be extremely upset if the next time labour gets into power ( 2025 at the earliest , really ) , they do n't actually push forward with true electoral reform . 
  clive lewis is our only hope in that regard . 
  in 2020 i 'll be becoming a labour member to vote for him . 
   it is true that the security services may be more competent than some of those on the continent there 's no question that ours are more competent than * all * of the others in the eu , separately . 
  and [ according to the head of mi6 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5l2tat/exclusive_britain_will_demand_a_leading_role_in/dbsiwok/ ) we give much more than we recieve , which indicates we 're also better than all of them combined . 
  only a few countries in the eu have the economic capacity to rival us , but then they do n't have the legislative will and a population that does n't mind the measures taken . 
  they also do n't have [ the privileged position we hold ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vteuibg.jpg ) in which the vast majority of europes internet traffic goes through us to get to the usa . 
  and we sniff the lot of it , apparently . 
   like its some huge favour to the eu depending on who you ask , we have the 2nd or 3rd best intelligence agency in the world . 
  sooo , yeah . 
  it kind of is . 
  there 's a reason we 've gone 12 years without a multi casualty terrorist attack while continental europe can barely go 12 weeks . 
  after the orange man , they 'll be longing after the black man again . 
  i know about 200 french lives that have changed quite a bit , and another 200 families lives too . 
  no no , that 's too nuanced for the internet . 
  everyone who voted leave did it because they hate muslims and want to see them driven off the cliffs of dover . 
  that narrative makes it much easier to dismiss all concerns of leave voters . 
  thereby making our job , as the infinite internet monkeys typing the works of a bathroom stall wall , easier . 
  why does everything have to be so black and white with so many people . 
  something is either all good , or it 's all bad . 
  no grey . 
  in some cases a8 is good . 
  in some cases , it is bad . 
  these seems to indicate to me that there 's room for improvement . 
  in particular the ` family ' bit can be dispensed with . 
  that case you cited would have had the exact same conclusion since it was about ` private ' life , not ` family ' life . 
  but that does n't make sense . 
  to guarantee a 2nd indyref , scotland would need to vote in while england/wales/ni voted out . . 
  the differing opinion is what was meant to justify indyref2 . 
  orb international ( who ? ), 
  had remain winning 53/46 just before the referendum . . http://uk.businessinsider.com/telegraph-eu-referendum-brexit-poll-remain-campaign-surging-2016-6, 
   so we will learn what the british public thinks is more important , deporting a handful of extremists or internet privacy . 
  well , looking at the shitshow in the rest of europe i 'd say deporting a handful of extremists is generally more important . 
  yes , but the minimum is too high . 
  ` right to family life ' can mean just about anything , and be used to achieve plenty of dumb shit by criminals . 
  i do n't believe enough people give a flying fuck to win an election on that platform . 
  the reason she 's going to run on that , is because she knows she can get away with it this election cycle because corbyn is so weak in the polls and labour is a shambles . 
  may does n't want to do this due to public support . 
  she wants to do it because * she * wants to do it . 
  so making it a campaign promise in an election she knows she 'll win legitimizes her doing it and shuts up opposition in the commons . 
  boooooooooooo . 
  her own . 
  if anyone is surprised by this , they 're an idiot .

  does bric exist ? 
  [ yes , it does . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bric ) so he was n't including south africa , he was pluralising an acronym as i initially thought .

  the article is about ireland 's relationship with the uk . 
  no , the submission is about that . 
  this comment thread is about [ this independent article that op posted in a comment . . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kep6t/pat_leahy_brexit_is_looking_worse_and_worse_for/dbnjcwu/ ) the guy that said ` brics ' was replying to that article . 
  try and keep up , darling . 
  objectives have been clear since day one . 
  single market access , no freedom of movement . 
  unfortunately , it 's not a particularly viable objective . 
   you 've decided to leave out south africa i honestly thought the 's ' was just pluralising it .
