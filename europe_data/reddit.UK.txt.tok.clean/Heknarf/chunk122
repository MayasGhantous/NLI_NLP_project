   i asked him to explain his statement and what it has to do with anything in a thread about the british economy tumbling . 
  it 's relevant because of the independent article he was quoting . 
  the reason the uk is predicted to ` tumble down the rankings ' is because india and brazil are predicted to overtake us . 
  they will also be overtaking everyone currently below us as well , including france . 
  the ` tumble ' is from 5th to 8th . 
  the countries predicted to overtake us are india , brazil and south korea . 
  so the title of the article is really a load of shit . 
  we 're not tumbling because of brexit . 
  we 're tumbling because gigantic population developing countries are , well , developing . 
  and because whoever did the study seems to think south korea is going to be able to more than double it 's gdp . 
  which is insanely optimistic , and i 'd love to see how they worked that out . 
  the uk is tumbling as much as france , spain , italy , etc are tumbling . 
  aka , not at all . 
  far better than my turkish . 
  do n't sell yourself short . 
  that was a perfectly eligible comment . 
  only corrections i 'd really make are :  dont worry , i am on ** a ** similar level . 
  i can watch english movies or read english text and i will understand 99 % . 
  but when i try to talk or write in english its just ** a ** disaster , just like now . 
  that surprises me , unless you 're an italian in the uk . 
  in which case it 'd make sense . 
  brazil , russia , india , china . 
  basically , countries with large populations that are relatively underdeveloped . 
  not all , but most . 
  i 'd be willing to bet none of the big ones leave . 
   guardian lol . 
  you can prove anything if you use british newspaper headlines . 
  you have 1 that says they 'll move , i can find you 1 that says they wo n't . 
  also , the subheadline is :  ** head of agency tasked with attracting foreign investment to ireland says ** city corporations are interested in relocating dare i say it 's in his interest to embellish what 's really happening ? 
   in exchange for a good chunk of the london financial services industry implying . 
  outside of internet forums such as these , no one really talks about brexit as far as i can tell . 
  i 've had maybe three irl conversations about it since it happened . 
  i 've done an ons survey . 
  yes they ask those things . 
  it 's useful information to know . 
   the brits really need to stop with these dreams of the british empire coming back . 
  do i really have to point out that the guy who made the video is clearly american , and the user who submitted it here is turkish . . 
  it 's nothing personal . 
  it 's just good economics . 
  yeah , because all british people are scum right ? 
   we firmly believe the derbyshire section should be incorporated into yorkshire . 
  the highest honour a yorkshireman can bestow . 
  i guess the question is , do the people who are pro-immigration feel as strongly about it as the people who are anti-immigration . 
   as a maltese , i say we should call their bluff and shoot a rocket at the plane . 
  as a sane person , i say negotiate for as long as possible . 
  then send in special forces if negotiations fail . 
  anal for sure . 
  there was 12 hours or so where the police had the wrong guy . 
  plenty of time to get the train to italy . 
  # ** ciao motherfucker **, 
  ` hey honey , how was work today ? 
  learn anything new ? ', 
  ` learned how to look up number plates on the car computer and how to use our taser . 
  oh , and i shot a wanted terrorist responsible for the death of 12 germans , and injury of 52 more . ', 
  \\  getting saved by france oh the embarrassment . 
  how can the usa even be proud of the result of the revolutionary war ? 
  also , the dutch were helping too . 
  so we fought a war on four fronts , won three of them , and americans think they were the ones that accomplished something ? 
  we fought the 2nd , 3rd and 4/5th biggest colonial powers at the same time and won . 
  where 's our national holiday ? 
  lmao , even in the 1800 's the housing market was a joke . 
  i give up . 
  i ca n't see the uk on there . 
  ` there is no god . . ' - remainers , about 6 months ago . 
  ciao motherfucker . 
  france has nukes . 
  oh , unilaterally using the pound ? 
  that 's fine by me . 
  economically awful for scotland , though . 
  entire finance sector would have to leave to the ruk so that they could continue to have a lender of last resort . 
  finance is one of those high wage , high taxed industries that you really do n't want leaving . 
  i think scotland would need to create its own currency if it wants to stand a chance at making independence work . 
   bitter nasty vindictive cunt i 'm not being vindictive . 
  ' i superimposed a flag over my face three times last year and the attacks are still happening . 
  i give up . 
  i 've tried everything . . ', 
  we will never stop terrorism if we do n't superimpose a flag over our faces on social media !, 
  i 'm bored of it . 
  it does n't really mean anything . 
  i do n't even like that we have a cookie cutter template for how to react when , yet again , we 're attacked . 
  in the event of scotland becoming independent i will write to my mp to tell him i will not vote for him again if he supports entering a monetary union with scotland . 
  you want to be independent , then be independent . 
  as an english taxpayer i do n't want to be on the hook for scottish government fuckups . 
  you fuck up , you deal with it . 
  monetary unions without political union is a disaster of a concept . 
  you 'll ( maybe ) be glad to know the uk is well and truly in the ` pain au chocolat ' camp . 
   what is stupid is some uk politicians saying the eu should pay the uk for access to their single market one fringe backbencher . 
  this sub is so frustrating . 
  well yeah , but someone has to make the decision . 
  we do n't have time to constantly be asking parliament . 
  what if we get to the 18 month mark and parliament rejects the proposal . 
  then we crash out of the eu without a deal , which parliament will never allow . 
  so the vote is pointless . 
  parliament will vote for whatever deal is presented to them , because if they do n't things just get worse . 
  at the end of the day the uk elected the tory party to represent them , and the tory party elected theresa may to represent them . 
  she has the mandate to take brexit in the direction she wants . 
  comparisons to north korea are fucking stupid , btw . 
   she would have free reign to become north korea , norway or a 51st us state . 
  what on earth are you talking about ? 
   no we 'd keep the one we have you 're going to lose the referendum again , lmao .
