  yeah , but if you were only going to shop in one country for weapons it 'd be the usa , right ? 
  thought you have to bail-in first ? 
  i do n't really blame you , i 'm just joking . 
  ** 2010 scotland : ** ` do n't want tories . ', 
  ** 2015 scotland : ** ` do n't want tories ! ', 
  ** 2015 ruk : ** ` boom , full majority . 
  suck it . ', 
  ** 2017 ruk : ** ` okay , we do n't want tories anymore . . ' ** 2017 scotland : ** ` not . 
  fast ... ' basically , you are a contentious people . . 
  spent # 200m per mp for this deal . 
  lmao . 
  ` we 've not got any money ! ... 
  here 's # 2bn to buy a hilariously slim and fragile majority with . . no money for the nhs though . ', 
  funnily enough , # 2bn extra is how much an independent assessment said social care needs to keep ticking along . 
  not sure about you lads , but i 'd definitely rather have social care functioning well than a tory majority . 
  also , since you have a scotland flair i ca n't possibly let you forget that * you deeeeeeeedddd thiiiiisssss * . . 
  agreed . 
  hate the names of these carriers . 
  now hms invincible . . that was a name for a carrier !, 
  well for starters generally the usa makes the best weapons . 
  he 's probably the most comfortable cabinet minister when it comes to interviews and being on tv . 
  leadership contender at some point ? 
  why is grated carrot such a hard thing to imagine ? 
  i just looked up recipes on youtube and i 'm not going mad . 
  jamie oliver and gordon ramsey both grate their carrots when making spag bol . 
  why do you think it is dogshit ? 
   almost everything is better with ketchup / sriracha / kikkoman teriyaki sauce . 
  first off , wrong . 
  secondly spaghetti bolognese is already tomato based . . why on earth would you add tomato ketchup onto it ? 
  seems to me you 'd just utterly ruin any subtlety you put into cooking the bolognese , and end up making it taste like ketchup . 
  try adding a carrot next time . 
  trust . 
  what , you do n't add carrot or you add big lumps like in op 's pic ? 
  carrots important . 
  sweetens the sauce . 
  it 's night and day if you leave it out , imo . 
  1 ) grate the carrot ( or dice it way way smaller ) 2 ) you mix the pasta and sauce before serving . 
  how is no deal better for eu citizens in the uk ? 
  our offer is fair . 
  i 'd like it to go a bit further in terms of guaranteeing eu citizens right , but i 'd never agree to the ecj having any power over us after brexit . 
  yep . 
  this is why it 's unworkable for the eu to demand ecj oversight . 
  any government could nullify it in the future . 
  it 's pointless asking for such a thing . 
  the ecj related demands from the eu are utterly absurd and unworkable . 
  not sure what they 're thinking with that . 
  clearly not . 
  we grate the carrot on the uk , but otherwise it looks okay . 
  and people want e-voting , lol ... 
  it 's like big ben hit the gym and deleted facebook . . 
   we have been told over and over we wont get free trade without accepting all 4 principles . 
  what ? 
  no we have n't . 
  how is there still so much ignorance about ? 
  we ca n't be a member of the single market without accepting those . 
  that 's no the same as a trade deal . 
  the eu has many trade deals with countries , and does n't require them to accept the 4 principles . 
  a trade deal is not as good ( in terms of trade ) as single market membership . 
  make the eu so good that we want to come back . 
  i honestly thought we had more slags . 
   they are experienced due to the fight against the mafia and deport islamists straightaway instead of years later . 
  how many muslim italians are there ? 
  because at least in the uk , there 's nowhere to deport most of our islamic terrorists to . 
  they 're british . 
  ** edit : ** 1.4 million , 2.3 % of the population . 
  much lower than that of uk/germany/france . 
  how is macron not whining here ? 
  why is it ` proposing solutions ' when macron does it , and ` whining ' when cameron did it ? 
  cameron never went as far as macron in his proposed ` solutions ' . . 
  frexit groundwork being set . 
  this is how it started in the uk . 
  frustration will boil over if it 's not fixed . 
  man , if you had a british flair and said this 1 year ago you 'd have been downvoted to -234 . . 
  groundwork for frexit is being laid . 
  these are the same kind of complaints that were popular in the uk starting about 10 years ago . 
  see you in 10 years , france !, 
  that 's the entire theory behind the eu , macron . . 
  [ told you . . ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40380584 ) eat dem words , you race flaming shit stirrer . 
  eu states do n't have a veto in a50 negotiations . 
  it 's qualified majority . 
  also the eu has no official jurisdiction on outside eu immigration to member states , so this will be part of a50 but in a totally unofficial manner . 
  eu will be acting as mediator , basically . 
  but it ca n't force the issue . 
  it 's pretty obvious that you ca n't have an eu hq that 's outside the eu . . 
  it 'd be like jp morgan having their us hq in london . 
  does n't make sense . 
  it 's why these announcements are so hollow . 
  i have n't been into a branch for years . . 
   you 'd be very surprised on how dodgy it all is !, 
  bet i would n't be !, 
  but the sun turns them into radiators . 
  only way a sun shield would work if it was before the window , not after . 
  we use f when it 's really hot , c every other time . 
  stornoway having the only nice weather they 've ever had , lol . 
   window shutters yeah , we do n't have them . 
  we have curtains and they just turn into radiators when the sun hits them . 
  if you keep the windows closed then all that happens is the sun shines through the windows and heats up the inside , with no way for the heat to exit . 
  not really . 
  heat is allowed in through windows easily , but ca n't escape as easily . 
  it 's a one way trip for heat .
