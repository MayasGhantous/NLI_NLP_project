   it has made it much more difficult -- and sometimes impossible -- to address pressing issues such as the budget . 
  due to our political system , whichever party has the most seats can basically do whatever they want . 
  there 's no differing houses ( other than the lords , who are n't particularly strong ) to allow for partisan stalemate . 
   it could do very well , if its politicians are n't completely useless . 
  dup bizarrely want a hard brexit . 
  they want a hard border with the rest of ireland . . 
  they 're the most retarded political party in the uk , and now they 've got a head seat at westminster . 
   it was a calculated gamble shame they contracted out the calculations to diane abbott . . 
  i do n't know how the tories keep getting away with such incompetence . . 
  nor why they keep taking the british public for granted . 
  calling the election * after * triggering article 50 was clearly an attempt to blackmail the public into voting for her . 
  but we 're a country of stubborn dickheads , so we do n't play such games . 
  we 'll burn our political system to the ground before we let a politician get one over on us . . 
  but you vote for local , and you vote for list . 
  do n't like the list , do n't vote for the list . 
  that 's the beauty of it . 
  with ams you get to do both . 
  you get a local representative , and then there 's a list as well . 
  the end result is proportionality with a link to constituencies . 
  people are n't really okay with it , but many people actually think we already operate a proportional representation system . 
  i was amazed at some responses i was seeing on my facebook this election to the idea of tactical voting . 
  people did n't seem to understand that a vote for labour is n't a vote for jeremy corbyn to become pm , and that voting labour can just help the tories depending on what the vote share looks like in your constituency . 
  and that sometimes you need to vote against your party , to help it . 
  we need political education at school . 
  everyone needs to have fptp explained to them . 
  if they knew about it , they 'd hate it . 
  2015 was the best . 
  3.8 million votes per seat . 
  i know that 's less than their current infinity , but it 's pretty stark . 
  it 's not fair , it 's fucking horse shit reeeeeeeee . . my cunty tory mp refuses to even properly engage with me on the issue of pr . 
  claims we had a referendum , and that 's that . 
  wo n't listen to me when i explain that av was * not * proportional representation . 
  it was an alternative voting system , but not a proportional one . 
  jokes on him . 
  his majority just got slashed from 15,000 to 4,000 . 
  maybe i should send him a few more emails . 
  welcome to the british electoral system . 
  where the votes do n't matter , and everything is made up . . 
  dude , if you 're not caught up with american politics then ... well i do n't want to spoil it for you , but go check it out !, 
  most consistently entertaining politics in the world right now . 
  i thought the new character they introduced was a bit unbelievable , but he 's grown on me . 
  woah woah woah . 
  time out !, 
  we 're not ready ... 
  gained 2 , to get a total of 10 . 
  watch out eu , we 've got our top minds on the case . . top . 
  minds ... 
  basically he 's saying he 'd trust a muslim to do something utterly low responsibility for him . 
  ` im crashing this country ... no survivors . ', 
  i remember a tory mp a few years ago referred to roi as ` southern ireland ' and massively pissed them off . 
  lol . 
  flagrant hypocrisy and contempt for the public is about the only thing the tories are good at , tbh . 
  i hope this is the most amount of seats they get in a long time . 
  i have some conservative sympathies , but the party is rotten to the core . 
  all politicians are liars and truth benders , but the tories take it to the extreme and it 's impossible to defend or excuse . 
  if there 's another election soon , i will vote for a corbyn lead labour even though i disagree with a lot of his manifesto . 
  the tories need to be shown up . 
  [ his nhs story . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrpj4n0ffgk ) i love that he 's clearly sat in on a serious political debate between candidates . 
  i wonder if they were n't allowed to exclude him , or if they just thought it 'd be fun . 
  and she won ? 
  corbyn is going to be pretty old by then . 
  i do n't think it 's very realistic to expect him to run in 2022 . 
  he could stay on for a few more years , then retire and pick someone to replace him . 
  overall a good thing . 
  times change , and so should laws . 
  we do n't have a written constitution . 
  our constitution is whatever laws are on our books at any given time , and none of them are safe from a majority government . 
  there 's technically a law in place to make it harder for pm 's to call an election when it 's advantageous . 
  it 's called the fixed term parliament act . 
  however there 's a clause that says if 2/3rds of the house of commons votes for it , an early election can happen . 
  and that makes the law kind of useless , because any party not voting for an election is admitting they ca n't win an election which looks bad . 
  so everyone votes for it . 
  it 's doublely useless because a simple majority in the house of commons can create or remove any law on the books , so any government wanting to call an election could just get their mp 's to revoke the law . 
  it 's technically true , because any country can leave at any time . 
  but that 's not practical . 
  while technically true , definitely not true in practice . 
  hell , i voted for brexit and i disagree with almost the entirety of your comment . 
  first off , immigration is a bit of a non-issue really . 
  or it could be if we did n't have an austerity government cutting services left right and center . . and we definitely need the eu more than the eu needs us , at least economically . 
  we make up a small percentage of eu exports , eu exports make up 40 % + of our exports . . 
  the economic argument never really existed for brexit . 
  either you were in it for the sovereignty argument , or you were mislead . 
  mostly anti-indyref2 . 
  nicola fucked up massively in gauging the tone of the country . 
  ** rest of world : ** do n't brexit it 's a bad idea . 
  ** uk : ** watch this . . ** rest of world : ** wtf ?!, 
  alright , just make sure it 's a soft - ** uk : ** hard brexit !, 
  ** rest of world : ** okay , christ . 
  just do n't make it harder for yourselves . 
  ** uk : ** and we 're going to do it without a government !, 
  ** rest of world : ** . . why do you do what you do ? 
  lmao , we are such a bunch of fucking spanners . 
  entering brexit negotiations without a government is impressively incompetent . 
  tories should be banned from ever forming a government again for this stupidity . 
  you kidding ? 
  this was a hilarious outcome . 
  love a good spanner in the works . 
  i never wanted the above , i just thought it was a bit inevitable . 
  pretty common . 
  not sure why that guy below said it is n't .
