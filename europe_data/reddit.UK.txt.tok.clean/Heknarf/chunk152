  i actually find the comparison pretty sexist , tbh . 
  literally all they have in common are that they 're woman tories . 
  and butchers know a thing or two about lambs going to the slaughter . 
   and how to increase controls on extremists where it is thought they present a threat but there is not enough evidence to prosecute them . 
  what possible acceptable form does that take ?? 
   make it easier to deport foreign terror suspects would have stopped zero of the past 3 attacks . . 
  may is n't offering up a realistic solution , though . 
  / r/ukpolitics is a fair bit more tolerant than / r/unitedkingdom . 
  boom boom boom boom i want the tories in my room we 're all in this together lol j/k now you 're poorer forever, 
  and old people . . and brexiters . . 
  genuinely true . 
  we did n't have a mass fatality attack for 12 years . . 
  so you 've turned down your night out to tackle the problem of terrorism . . what do you do next ? 
  what 's stage 2 ? 
  ` alright mate , hows it going ? 
  wan na come out tonight , there 's a 90 's club night on . 
  gunna be banging . ', 
  our country is having problems with terrorism . . ', 
  had to look up its origins . 
   borrowing from arabic \u0628\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062a ( bint , `` girl , daughter '' ) , from proto-semitic * bint - , used to denote a patronym . 
   the term entered the british lexicon during the occupation of egypt at the end of the nineteenth century , where it was adopted by british soldiers to mean `` girlfriend '' or `` bit on the side '' . 
  it is used as a derogatory slang word in the united kingdom , meaning ` woman ' or ` girl ' . 
  its register varies from that of the harsher bitch to an affectionate term for a young woman , the latter being more commonly associated with the west midlands . 
  the term was used in british armed forces and the london area synonymously with bird in its slang usage ( and sometimes brass ) from at least the 1950s . 
  the term was also used in the film monty python and the holy grail , in which the lady of the lake is referred to as a `` moistened bint '' , and in the phrase `` grotty scots bint '' in the `` english english '' scene of the film austin powers in goldmember . 
  it also appears in the famed british sitcom fawlty towers , in which basil fawlty refers to his assistant polly as a `` cloth-eared bint . '', 
  everyone knows eurodance is haram !, 
  dancing to it is one of the strongest acts of defiance . 
  it 's even in the quran . 
  page 244 . 
  look it up . 
  my body is ready . 
  i think i 've rotted my brain with binge drinking though . 
  i now blackout incredibly easy , which is no fun . 
  what good is having a laugh , if you ca n't remember it ? 
  might have to pack it all in . 
  was fun while it lasted !, 
  if you listen carefully , you can hear the berlin wall falling down in the background . 
  was a documentary about british jihadists . 
  worth a watch . 
  it 'd bother me ... that i could n't get my clothes on quick enough and get out there to dance . 
  did anyone get hurt ? 
  correct . 
  apparently . 
  boom boom boom boom , i want corbyn in my room , lets overspend together , like labour has forever !, 
  where do you kick british citizens out to , exactly ? 
  [ evidence suggests that 's probably not true . . ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/04/27/foreign-investors-back-brexit-britain/ )  uk fdi inflows soared to $ 253.7 bn ( # 197bn ) in 2016 , up from # 33bn the previous year , according to the organisation for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) . 
   the figures also showed the uk drove the bulk of the 17pc increase in fdi inflows to the european union . 
   britain also climbed above ireland , switzerland , the netherlands and france to become the top destination for inward fdi across europe and second only to the us in the oecd club of 35 rich economies . 
  \\ ^ \\ ^ \\ ^ \\ ^ \\ ^ \\ ^ guy i do n't want in my room . 
  i 'll take that over whatever / r/unitedkingdom is . . 
  one small part of his argument . 
  at the end of the video he says that the biggest thing theresa may could do is employ more normal bobbies so that community policing can continue to have the success it 's always had . 
  12 years without any major terrorist attacks , and then this year we get lots . 
  it 's clear police cuts are starting to take hold . 
  so no answers , as usual from your ilk . 
  when you 've got answers , get back to me . 
   it wasnt funding that held them back [ oh yeah ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvjydsl5j1u ), 
   current legislation means that shy of admitting when , where and how he is going to attack there is nothing that can be done . 
  what on earth is the alternative to that ? 
   bloody well fed up of people thinking we should just keep funding the police to compensate for a rising islamic population . 
  just stop any more coming in for fuck sake and the problem will eventually die down . 
  they 're all british born . . 
  this is all the remnants of our much much more lax immigration policies of the 70 's . 
   why the hell do we have to have our doors open to a people that only want to come here because we are successful ? 
  we do n't . .  fuck my life . 
  retards thinking it is viable to watch 23000 people 24/7 . 
  beyond belief . 
  what 's the alternative ? 
  the 23,000 are here , and they 're a threat . 
  surely more police can only help . 
  this post has nothing to do with ` closing borders ' , so i have no idea why you 're making out that i 'm even against that . 
  it has everything to do with eroding basic human rights . 
  this guy would have got his shit handed to him by british police too . 
  just would have likely survived . 
  a hammer is kinda shitty , but it 's more than possible for 2 unarmed police officers to take down someone like that . 
  get your spray out , get him in the eyes , then beat him with your batons until your arms get tired . 
   have n't we learned anything on building walls ? 
  well we 've not tried it . . 
  shouting ` this is for syria ' seems to have been his mistake . 
  you do n't actually have to do much as isis leadership . 
  just egg on a load of pathetic nobodies in other countries and hope one or two pull off an attack . 
  it 's low effort , low risk . 
  best case scenario ? 
  they attack . 
  worst case scenario ? 
  another jihadi in prison who can maybe convert some other nobodies to maybe carry out an attack . 
  when isis send their people , they 're not sending their best . 
  pre-9 / 11 world was more fun . 
   you could have started with extra-ue immigration . 
  people were pissed with unskilled immigration . 
  we do n't import unskilled from the rest of the world , they basically only come in from the eu . 
  i approve , regardless of the mental gymnastics needed to get there . 
  you 're welcome , europe . 
  i honestly do n't think he 'll be president long enough to get his state visit . 
  fuck sake , one of them was on a fucking tv show called ` jihadi next door ' . . 
  if you ca n't catch the ones that literally advertise the fact they 're jihadis on tv , then what the fuck good will any bullshit legislation have . 
  just fund the police properly ya stupid bint . 
  it 's more like 3 million .
