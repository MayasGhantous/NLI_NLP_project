  tumbling out of the eu does n't secure eu citizens rights . 
  nice try , japan . . 
   it can be extended needs the agreement of every single member of the council . 
  so essentially , it 's impossible . 
  there 'll always be one country sticking its oar in . 
   a new trade deal requires unanimity . 
  that 's true , but that 's separate from brexit . 
   i fucking doubt that the brexit negotiations will be complete before 2020 . 
  well article 50 will be completed at least . 
  there 's a 2 year limit . 
   one of nations can halt brexit to eternity . 
  not true . 
  article 50 requires a ` qualified majority ' approval from the council . 
   what 's more shocking are the amounts of people ( especially in this subreddit ) who believe that leaving the eu will be a swift process . 
  i do n't think many people think that . 
  they just understand the constraints inherent with article 50 . 
  it 'll take 2 years because it has to . 
  the eu and uk do n't have a choice . 
  article 50 was written with the 2 year maximum limit specifically to make leaving as hard and undesirable as possible . 
  because most people realise leaving in a good fashion in just 2 years is impossible . 
  it was . 
  it was very unpopular with some people ( hence massive protests ) , but was generally popular . 
  63 % approval rating by the general public in 2003 . 
  so it was much more popular than brexit . 
  what , a 180 ? 
   honestly after scotland and n.ireland jump the ship england will be left all alone . 
  this fucking sub i swear . 
   eu would accept england back but under our conditions . 
  which the british would be unlikely to want . 
  we voted out even with our opt-outs and rebate . 
  anything less than the exact same conditions , and public opinion will be well and truly against being in the eu . 
  i do n't think the eu would . 
  and i also do n't think we 'd ever ask to go back . 
  same reason for both . 
  it 's been too economically shite to risk it happening again . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  well lets hope germany keeps doing well for the next 40 years , because those people will become targets if there 's enough economic turmoil . 
  i was n't really thinking about asylum seekers . 
  besides , ca n't we just kick them back to ireland ? 
  i thought that 's perfectly legal ? 
  you 're meant to claim asylum in the first safe country you enter . 
  ca n't we just assume that eu immigrants do n't really want to live in ni , so it wo n't be much of a problem ? 
  there 's only one place they seem to want to go , and that 's england . 
  scotland , ni , and wales have fuck all immigration compared to england . 
  assuming all goes well , to be fair . 
   sweeten the deal by giving the french city the european medicine agency in return do n't mind us . . just fixing the eu one brexit at a time . 
  this is your tape . . 
  definitely goes against the spirit of the vote if we 're being honest , though . 
  strategically in the uk we should probably allow it because our turks are much more likely to vote it down . 
  but it looks bad if we do allow it . 
  there 's no mechanism in our legal system to give that reassurance . 
  asking for it is pointless . 
  eu needs to explain the rights they want reserved , and we 'll need to give them to the 3.5 m eu citizens in the uk . 
  they 'll have to trust us that we wo n't renege . 
  there 's no alternative . 
  i 'm pretty sure moggy uses a paper and quill still . 
  not got around to using computers and the internet . 
  there would n't be war . 
  we 'd just be mega fucking frosty with the eu and the member states . 
  incorrect . 
  or as i like to put it : legally not binding , politically binding . 
  ed miliband must be going nuts about now . 
  the media better not go soft on the tories for their hypocrisy here . . 
   the most controversial argument from within the eu is that the european court of justice continues to provide the final guarantee of entitlements . 
  this will seriously never be allowed . 
  the eu need to drop it . 
  it 's a ridiculous ask , frankly . 
  and it 'd be unenforceable in british law since parliament is sovereign . 
  parliament can repeal any law that gives the ecj any jurisdiction over the uk . 
  it 'd be purely a symbolic gesture if we did it . 
  any government could undo it . 
  i do n't even get who the eu would make the offer to . 
  may is our pm . . she 's running the country . 
  presumably they 'd have to make her the offer . . 
  it 's just dumb . 
  can someone please tell me how the ` long term ' figure is calculated ? 
  is it like the rest of the reports before the referendum : * predict what gdp will be in 2030 if we remain in the eu * predict what gdp will be in 2030 if we leave the eu * show the difference as a percentage if so , it all seems extremely speculative to me . 
  i 've never seen a 13 year economic prediction be remotely right . 
  too much can happen in that time frame . 
  [ very hard to take him seriously after this tweet . . ] ( https://twitter.com/acgrayling/status/836657474568617984 ), 
  i 'm not being triggered . 
  what you 're saying just does n't make much sense . 
  still does n't explain why we 'd be dropping anyone . 
  who would the eu even be making such proposals to ? 
  who would they talk to to ` drop may ' . . she 's the head of our government . 
  they 'd have to suggest that to her . 
  we 're just going to attempt to subvert your democracy . 
  that 's cool , yeah ? 
  ** uk : ** what ? 
  of course not . 
  ** eu : ** haha , just joking . 
  imagine if i actually said that . 
  haha . 
  imagine if i said that , what would your response be ? 
  you know , if i said that . . 
  i did n't , but if i did . 
  do n't get on the boats , and you do n't drown . . 
   so it would strategically make sense to drop him in a couple of years to make a ` concession ' towards the uk during the negotiations ; ` you drop may , we drop junker ' . 
  i 'll have whatever you 're smoking . . that 'd go down like a ton of bricks . 
  lol k,
