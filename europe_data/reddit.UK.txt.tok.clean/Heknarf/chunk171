  i think we 're all aware of catholic terrorism . 
  thanks . 
  i honestly had no idea sikh terrorism was a thing . 
  killing a bunch of canadians because india pissed you off is retarded . 
  details ? 
  you 're talking shit . 
  prove your claim . 
  show me proof of white people defending their shops during the london riots , being called yobs . 
  that never happened . 
  i remember when they got their ceremonial swords out and protected businesses during the london riots . 
  was pretty bad ass . 
  it 's really just pakistanis , from what i can tell . 
  they 've not integrated as well as they could have . 
  hindus and sikhs have done much much better , and did n't have a lot of the undesirable cultural traits to begin with . 
  i ca n't believe it 'll actually happen . 
  france is proper fucked if it does . . and not standard anglo rhetoric ` lol , france is fucked ! ' ... 
  actual france is fucked . 
   do you seriously think that the uk can maintain visa free access to 27 countries yes . 
  we have it with something like 150 countries currently . 
   visa free access does n't mean guaranteed access . 
  nor does eu freedom of movement . 
  hooligans ca n't afford flights to those places , so you do n't have to worry . 
  stage one of invasion complete . 
  er , if you elect a frexit government then wo n't that front page be proved correct ? 
  far left , far right . 
  it 's all fucking shite . 
  lets see if we ca n't get onto 2017 's wild ride . 
  haha , wuuut ? 
  if nato survived trump , it 'll survive anything . 
  i can find so many sources saying they 're incompatible with the customs union , though . . http://www.cityam.com/253603/economic-benefits-free-port-scheme-after-brexit-illusion  free ports are incompatible with being part of the european customs union , as the cps themselves admit . 
  the customs union means that our companies do not have to go through expensive , time-consuming procedures when selling their products in europe -- meaning free and easy trade with our biggest market . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/14/free-ports-would-fill-the-sails-of-the-post-brexit-economy/  the culprit for this is the european union . 
  its customs code is a murky 60,000 word document setting out the customs union 's rules , regulations , and procedures . 
  to cut a painfully long story short , if the uk wanted its manufacturers to benefit from free ports , it would first have to prove that this would n't damage the interests of other eu countries . 
   given the eu 's baffling array of special interest groups -- from german washing machine manufacturers to hungarian vineyards -- this is a mountainous hurdle , making the development of british free ports impossible without a barrage of legal challenges . 
   furthermore , overly restrictive eu state aid rules hamstring britain 's ability to use tax incentives to support job creation , a common practice outside of europe . 
  https://theconversation.com/brexit-offers-free-port-opportunities-but-the-eu-can-beat-britain-to-them-71038  while continental europe was the birthplace of free ports , the eu neither develops them directly nor encourages them . 
  free ports existing before host states entered the union have partly retained their status , but new ones have not been created . 
  boston has manufacturing facilities within their foreign-trade zones , as do many many others in the us i imagine . 
  boston for one . 
  there 's loads . 
  google ` us foreign-trade zone ' for more . 
  the usa is impoverished ? 
  lets make it official then , it clearly works !, 
  even better that the eu prohibits it , it gives us a huge advantage . 
  are we the only european country with ports ( soon to be ) not in the eu ? 
  ** edit : ** oh , norway . 
  still i think rotterdam would be upset . 
  yep , it 's like some kind of rule for country subreddits to be absolutely nothing like the country . 
  [ solution . 
  ] ( http://www.cps.org.uk/publications/reports/the-free-ports-opportunity/ ) honestly a brilliant idea , and would help our ports immensely . 
  the eu has assets that we 've paid for too , so we could do the same in any such situation . 
  but obviously this is all ridiculous , and it 'll never come to such hostile ridiculousness . 
  [ some further reading . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39280813 ) tl ; dr if we pay , it 'll be because of politics not legality . 
  as such , the eu is going to have to compromise just like the uk will . 
  aka , a negotiation . 
   none of our concern right now of course it is . 
  it 's internal british politics which got us to vote out of the eu . . as much as it must pain you to hear that we have relevance , our internal politics is of your concern when you have things you want from us . 
  [ some interesting reading . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39280813 ) tl ; dr it 'll be politics that is used to get a payment , not law . 
  ya wo n't be getting 60 billion euros . 
   the legal grounds for having to pay are as solid as the scottish highlands . 
  they 're really not . 
  article 50 is very very brief and open ended . 
  it specifically says that after 2 years that unless an agreement is reached all treaties cease to apply . 
  it 's those treaties that require us to pay our fees , sooo ... 
   leaving the eu does n't suddenly absolve you of legal liabilities . 
  actually , it does . 
  it 's the entire point of it , in fact . 
   ** the treaties shall cease to apply ** to the state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or , failing that , two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2 , unless the european council , in agreement with the member state concerned , unanimously decides to extend this period . 
   the gibraltar situation does n't matter that much as it was stupid comments made by someone with little influence on the government . 
  [ huh ? 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/02/eu-will-not-go-soft-on-gibraltar-brexit-talks-diplomats-say-spain )  the eu will not back down in its support for spain 's demands when it comes to the rock of gibraltar in brexit negotiations , senior european diplomats have said . 
  sounds like some pretty important people are making it an issue to me . 
   you signed up to pay , so you will pay . 
  the legal grounds for having to pay this bill are somewhere between extremely shaky , and non-existent . 
  so yeah , internal politics of the uk is the concern of the eu if they ever want to see that money . 
  if we pay it , it 'll either be as an act of good will or more likely a bribe for a comprehensive transitional deal . 
  it wo n't be because we 're actually required to . 
  i sense you will be quite upset in the coming months . 
  anyway , i 've given you a heads up . 
   it was definitely a miss opportunity on the uk 's behalf . 
  2008 would have utterly fucked us without the ability to devalue our currency , do our own qe , etc. 
  we were the worst hit of the major economies by far . 
  not if they 're remotely sane , no . 
  i think you really do n't understand the political environment in the uk if you genuinely believe that . 
  paying that money is political cancer in the uk . 
  you 'll see how impossible the situation will become for may soon enough . 
  only way it happens will be a transitional deal akin to full single market membership until 2022 ( 3 years after leaving eu ) , which we pay for yearly which amounts to the # 30bn that the eu thinks we owes . 
  but that 's seriously stretching her domestic political good will . 
  add in any concessions , and she 's on the ropes . 
  and you have spain bitching about gibraltar . 
  paying the money , and sailing gibraltar down the river ? 
  rip her political career . 
  it could make logical political sense for her to just tell the eu to fuck itself , and that 's something people here really do n't understand . 
  if the divorce bill does n't torpedo negotiations , then gibraltar will . 
  ready for hard brexit , boys ? 
  itsa coming !, 
  within 3 months , utter stalemate and hostility .
