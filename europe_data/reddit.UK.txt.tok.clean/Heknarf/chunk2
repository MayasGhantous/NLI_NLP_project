  lock and key that shit . 
  only maintenance crew should be able to insert a usb device into it . . 
  if we brexit , immigration will not be any part of any trade deal we negotiate . 
  we 'll sooner just not be in the single market . 
  on the flip side , the boe said the other month that uninhibited immigration drives down wages . 
  so who knows , maybe we could see an increase in wages anyway due to lack of supply of workers . 
   14 % to 75 % lies , damn lies , and statistics . . 
  i genuinely think the core members could have become a full fledged federation by now if they 'd just stuck to the original 6 . 
  the eu expanded too quickly . 
  do you really think the current eu is the best we can manage as a continent ? 
  that 's depressing . 
   sail into a past dream every time with this meme . 
  you guys on here talk about the empire more than any brit does . 
  do n't you remember when we started ww1 and ww2 ? 
  could give up on the eu and start again using what we 've learned . 
  when i read the title i figured they meant i 'd lose a months wages * every year * in 4 years time . 
  as in my wage will be 11/12th of what it was . 
  maybe that 's what they 're attempting to get into the publics mind . 
  you can find solid arguments for both remain and leave . 
  in the end , this really comes down to sovereignty and immigration . 
   only 21 % of legislation came from the eu only ? 
  controversial opinion , but the amount of people who ca n't weather a < 2 % pay cut is as near as matters no one . 
  we 've got the best overall coverage , imo . 
  militarily speaking . 
  that looks * really * costly in pretty much every way imaginable . 
  how much does it output , because maintenance on that thing is going to be insane . 
   however , the old friends from the bullingdon club that prepared themselves to their political leadership trashing restaurants and college rooms are not qualified enough for such a task . 
  do n't worry , though . 
  corbyn and his two e 's at a-levels is on the case !, 
   a britain leaving , on the other hand , might do away with the need for a multi-speed europe altogether as the `` core integrators '' lose the biggest opponent both in economic terms and the wish for security autonomy biggest opponent , but not only opponent . 
  surely it 'll just put the smaller euroskeptic countries on the back foot as they 'll be without an important and influential ally . 
  what absolute cunts . 
  what 's the point , even . 
  it 's fucking bottled water . 
  no one 's going to buy it from you , and you all have taps . . 
  [ we gave it to them willfully . . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tizard_mission ) and they repaid us by not sharing how to make a nuclear bomb , even though it was the tizard mission that originally told them it could even be done . 
  still , we got back at them at a later date when we detonated a gigantic a-bomb and said it was a h-bomb . 
  then america shared their h-bomb plans with us and we built a real one . 
   with not much going on upstairs .

  i feel like that last one breaks a shit ton of laws , but nothing came of it . 
  \\ #yourenicked, 
  generally it 's one of these two : http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/27/section/1 take your pick , they both allow the same bullshit prosecution of people on twitter . 
  both deem ` being offensive ' as breaking the law . 
  clearly these prosecutions are n't in the spirit of the law at all , and it just goes to show you how a poorly drafted bit of legislation can cause havoc . 
  it 's absurd those two laws have n't been ammended , but so far no one has argued their side in court . 
  they take the # 200 fine or whatever and call it a day . 
  until someone rich and famous is tried under such laws , nothing will change . 
  i 've been reporting celebrities tweets whenever i think they offend me , but so far no luck . 
  very much one law for us , another for them . 
   if the uk implements a border policy as in a border between ni and ireland ? 
  we would n't . 
  it 's completely pointless . 
  no one is asking for that , and no one wants that . 
  sometimes you need an arsehole . 
  we just did n't really need one in 1951 . 
  i 'd be happy with leaders who can simply run the uk , tbh . . 
   the eu makes britain even greater # ** stay in the eu . 
  mukga ** # ** high energy obama ** # ** farage is a mess **, 
   have you anticipated however , the eu leaning on ireland to not reach a bilateral free movement agreement with the uk ? 
  no , [ because there 's already an existing one in place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_travel_area ) and the eu did n't manage to lean on ireland to join schengen . 
  ireland is also already going to be pissed off that the eu is impacting trade with the uk , so strong arm tactics will go down in ireland like a lead balloon . 
   i was just answering this question , and not in relation to the entire comment chain . 
  ok . just fyi , that 's a confusing thing to do . 
  my comment was clearly in context to all the comments and the general discussion that came before it . .  uk -- eu-wide free movement , however , will be unlikely to happen without a separate negotiation . 
  yes , i am not arguing otherwise . 
   if the uk and ireland want to continue free movement of individuals ( just between the two ) , then they can do so via a bilateral treaty in the context of international law . 
  we are in full agreement then . 
  i do n't think you understand the arguments being made here . 
  i am arguing that in the event of a brexit neither ireland nor the uk will have to monitor their border with each other . 
  freedom of movement does n't come into it . 
  that 's a completely different issue . 
  disagree .

  directing me to a 47 page document is not adequate , btw . 
  at least give me a page number to look at . 
  i think there 's a general misconception about what the ` control our borders ' rabble is really about . 
  a lot of the argument comes down to anyone from the eu being able to rock up in the uk , get hired for a job , and start getting various benefits , using the nhs , etc , etc. 
  now ignoring the validity of those fears , all that can be achieved without actual border controls . 
  simply being an illegal immigrant rather than a legal immigrant means it 'll be harder to find work , and they will have no access to the benefit system . 
  and if caught , we can chuck them out no questions asked . 
  that satisfies the brexiters 9 times out of 10 . 
  there 's no political will for a ni/ireland hard border in the uk . 
  everyone knows ni is a bit of a basket case , and we do n't want to stir up shit . 
  the vast majority would be happy with simply turfing out illegals perpetually . 
  did you see my edit ? 
  we could make it double barrel like unmarried couples do with their babies last name . 
  the british-irish isles . 
  i guess i 'd ask how an external border is defined . 
  seems to me they 're talking about the shengen border , in which case irelands existing border would constitute an external border and is protected by normal border controls . 
  [ this seems to back me up , in that it specifically mentions a common border policy only for the schengen area . 
  ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_5.12.4.html )  a single area without internal border checks -- the schengen area -- requires a common policy on external border management . 
  the union therefore sets out to establish common standards with regard to controls at its external borders and to gradually put in place an integrated system for the management of those borders .
