  cameron has blocked that . 
  but that has n't happened . 
  that 's my point . 
  i 'm 27 . 
  sex education started in primary school for me . 
  just the very basics when i was about 10 or 11 . 
  then we had some more when i was about 13 , and we watched a video that explained more detail . 
  mostly about the reproductive cycle really . 
  then we played with condoms and bananas when i was about 15 or so . 
  fairly fine sex education , imo . 
  highlight was this exchange when our teacher showed us a femidom : ** friend : ** ` i 'll never fill that ! ', 
  ** teacher : ** ` maybe when you 're older . ', 
  ** friend : ** ` i 'd have to do it 20 times to get it even half full ! ', 
  literally nothing has changed from yesterday , but people are making out that this is a step backwards . 
  it 's not a step backwards , it 's just not a step forwards . 
  i 'm ron burgundy ? 
  no shit . 
  wants something from us . 
  same reason most of the countries are opposing it . 
  it does n't explain if they were meant to or not . 
  has n't our tactic from the very start been against isis infrastructure ? 
  we have altered the crossiant , pray we do n't alter it any further . . 
  good lads . 
  busy making their own country more prosperous . 
  france you absolute bantersauruses . . 
  to be expected . 
  man , i 'm surprised we 're so low . 
  everyone i know eats pasta all the time . 
  i probably eat it 3-4 times a week for dinner . 
  pasta and rice are my carb source 95 % of the time . 
   you realise this shit predates twitter ? 
  yes , that 's why i said :  it was written in 2003 before social media was a thing , and really is n't fit for purpose any more . 
  literally the second sentence i wrote . . 
  reminder that the law includes something as vague as ` offensive ' . . 
  it was not well thought out . 
  it 's not talking about ownership , it 's talking about access . 
  should be interesting to see if her case is used to get him off . 
  i 'm no lawyer , but it seems to me that it 's highly relevant and i think it was the first time the communications act was actually challenged . 
  everyone before was some sap who just accepted the charges no contest to get it all over with quickly and cheaply . 
  the eu is a collection of countries only looking out for their own best interests while talking the big talk on ` unity ' . 
  when you realise this , the dysfunction of the eu makes total sense . 
  we used to . 
  i remember eating them as a kid . . then they stopped selling them . 
  tried them again a few years back . 
  they 're fucking disgusting . 
  eh , it 's poorly worded but in context it 's much more reasonable . 
  also , this law has nothing to do with dc . 
  it was tony blairs government that created it . 
   communications act i fucking hate this legislation . 
  it was written in 2003 before social media was a thing , and really is n't fit for purpose any more . 
  they [ use section 127 ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127 ) to prosecute twitter users for saying dumb shit . 
  all because of the inclusion of one little word , that should never be used in any legislation ever because of how subjective it is . 
   a person is guilty of an offence if he --  ( a ) sends by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly ** offensive ** or of an indecent , obscene or menacing character ; or it was meant to prosecute prank callers , essentially . 
  but now people can put out a tweet and they have no idea who is going to read it . 
  anyone can find anything offensive , so it can be used by pretty much anyone to get anyone arrested for anything . 
  apart from i 've been reporting celebrities to the police ( katie hopkins , nick griffin ) for their dumb and offensive tweets in an attempt to get one of them arrested and bring some much needed attention to how crappy a law it is . 
  possibly one of them will have enough money to fight their case and win . 
  but the police always say they 're not going to do anything . 
  because they 're scared their plebian silencing law will be revoked . 
  fucking hate this shit . 
  how many are irish americans ? 
   india , brazil not in our lifetime . 
  they both have huge cultural and social problems which is going to hamper their growth . 
  no shit . 
  but that 's ultimately their problem . 
  if we leave the eu , it will only negatively impact us and them as much as they allow it to . 
  [ actual reason for joining . . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l9i2rw1.jpg ), 
  there 's definitely a very odd sense of entitlement from polish people on this sub about what happened during and after ww2 . . we watched hitler invade and conquer how many countries before we picked poland as the line in the sand that should n't be crossed ? 
  should be glad we even put a line in the sand . 
  could have easily ignored it like we did with every country before it . 
  poster above has it a bit right . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letters_of_last_resort one of the possible options is to not retaliate . 
  i thought it was a bit silly , and they 'd not followed the logic all the way through . 
  first off you have to set an example for the world going forth . 
  everyone must know that a nuke is met with a nuke . 
  deterrence likely failed in this scenarios because mad has never been tested . 
  putin tested it , and it was shown as a fraud . 
  an empty threat . 
  not firing back makes the world a more dangerous place in the future because everyone who subscribed to mad doctrine will unsubscribe and now see their nuclear weapons as offensive weapons , not just defensive . 
  that 's a very scary would to live in . 
  secondly , neutralize the threat . 
  russia was willing to nuke us , so who else would they be willing to nuke in the future . 
  hit every military installation we know about plus the kremlin to reduce their capacity to fight anyone else . 
  the nuking of our carriers was ridiculous . 
  that 'd just never happen . 
  is our energy expensive ? 
  currently on a ` green ' energy plan where 20 % is renewables , and 80 % is natural gas . 
  so one of the more expensive energy plans . 
  ~ 13.5 p per kwh . 
  i barely use any electricity anyway . 
  last months bill was # 22 , and i do n't have gas . . 
  i wonder how people use so much energy , tbh . 
  then again , i 'm not scared of just wearing a jumper in the house when it 's cold and my flats insulation is pretty good . 
   this is what the vote is for : the vote is out of the eu , remaining in the eea but exiting the eu as is what the swiss have . 
  page number to back up that claim ? 
  everywhere would be a radioactive wasteland , but at least this patch of radioactive wasteland has a moat . 
  of course , you 're all unwelcome . 
  bloody eastern european mutants . 
  coming over here and taking hard working british mutants rations . 
  i doubt the british public will allow us to stay in/rejoin the eea if they vote out of the eu .
