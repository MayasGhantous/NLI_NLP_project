  ca n't imagine a worse idea . 
  islamist extremists should be completely isolated from the general prison population . 
  it 's well known that lots of conversions happen in prison , and that should n't be allowed to happen . 
  the only people the extremists should be able to have contact with is prison employees who are atheist or at least do n't mind pretending to be atheist around the prisoners . 
  i 'm not saying solitary , btw . 
  i think there should be a lot of staff readily available to talk to in these prisons . 
  they should just have no access to other prisoners . 
  damn , 1535 is long enough ago that they might just be a standard part of the uk with an english speaking population had it happened . 
  weird . 
  cheers for the info . 
  when was the offer made ? 
  i 'd never heard of this . 
  i wonder how it would have changed iceland , if at all . 
  well they won in that there were no real lasting repercussions for them , even though there really should have been . 
  then again , we did some seriously shitty shit too . 
  i think it 's best we call it a draw and never discuss it again . 
  that seems to be the current tactic , and it seems to be working well . 
  americas the black sheep of the family who ends up a rockstar because they 're a jammy cunt . 
  haha , weird . 
  clearly this was before we realised how much cod were in your waters . 
  precious precious cod . 
  it 's got to be france , has n't it ? 
  we have a sibling like relationship with each other . 
   mutual enemies historically a terrific way to bond . 
  hell , i 've made friends that way . 
  i 'd say it 's true for most countries , yes . 
  certainly the uk . 
   in terms of help , it 's more of a matter of the uk not asking for help , than the us not providing it . 
  worth noting that we were banging the ` bomb syria ' drum pretty fucking hard in 2013 , and the us followed our lead . . 
  but then cameron lost the vote in parliament and the whole thing was put on ice for a year or so . 
  it 's not as one sided a relationship as people like to make out . 
   did n't the us offer the british an aircraft carrier during the falklands war as well as missiles and submarine detectors ? 
  even if they did , it does n't excuse their current ( and long standing ) refusal to come out in support of the falklanders right to self determination . 
  also , reagan and thatcher had a very close relationship , which is likely why the offer was made . 
  the reagan/thatcher era was a bit of a golden age for the ` special relationship ' post ww2 . . 
  but even then he 'd [ sometimes go behind her back if it was in the us 's best interests . . ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/nov/10/ronald-reagan-apologises-margaret-thatcher-grenada-audio ), 
   ` america has no permanent friends or enemies , only interests . ', 
  \\ - kissinger, 
  in ww1 , yes, 
   europeans do n't deserve the eu . 
  i think we 're in agreement , but for different reasons haha . 
  we do n't deserve the eu like we do n't deserve getting kicked in the bollocks . 
  ` we 'll just leave all the bulldozers here and turn our backs ... aaaaand , they 're on fire again . ', 
  because it can just as easily be used to remove information that is in the public interest . 
  i do n't trust it at all . 
  this is such a tactical blunder if obamas intentions are what he says they are . 
  people here have a phobia of listening to american presidents since the iraq war . . 
  the # 87bn seems likely it 's the gross , not net . 
  so a bit dishonest . 
  adding up the figures in the last graph of your last link , that 's # 49.8 bn . . add another ~ # 10bn for this year and that 's ~ # 60bn of net contributions . 
  so it 'd have possibly countered austerity by a large margin . 
  austerity is ideological , though . 
  not practical . 
  so nothing would have changed . 
  i ca n't read that language , but i do see the date ' 2010 ' in there . 
  bit out of date , no ? 
  especially as there was a change of how payments are calculated since then . 
  also , our economy has grown substantially which means our payments will have increased . 
  papers were reporting # 8-10bn as our net contribution ( as in , money we do n't get back ) recently . 
  edit :  [ britain will make a net contribution to the eu budget of ** # 10.4 billion ** this year , up from a forecast of # 9.9 billion in march . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11727741/budget-2015-cost-of-eu-member-to-be-3-billion-higher-than-expected.html ) that 's 13.4 bn euros . 
  way more than what you claimed . 
   an fta will economically set you back though even the worst case scenario predicted is < 4 % of gdp . 
  that 's with the eu making an example of us and not even allowing a fta of any kind . 
  that 's us operating on standard wto tariffs with the eu . 
  with a fta ( which we 100 % would get ) it 's sub 2 % impact . 
  one years growth at current rates . .  trade will not be as easy as it was with the eu , that is true . 
  [ but a lot of this map is still grey . . ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/eu_free_trade_agreements.png/1280px-eu_free_trade_agreements.png ) , so it could also become easier with countries outside the eu . 
  i do n't think it 'd be anywhere near as doom and gloom as most people on here seem to make out . 
  that 's true enough . 
  it may be worth it for us to just have a normal fta and not be inside the common market . 
  my mistake . 
  fyi , the official options are going to be ` leave ' and ` remain ' . 
  that 's because they value the freedom of movement of labour . 
  we do n't , so it wo n't be part of ours . 
  bit confusing :  as usual , absolutely zero mention of what happens after a `` no '' vote . 
  did you mean ` leave ' by ` no ' , then ? 
  for fuck sake . 
  why would you attack an 81 year old man ? 
  stupid mouth breathing dickheads . 
   the eu will not sign any trade agreement that does n't preserve the four freedoms . 
  they already do . 
  here 's a list of them : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements  every single trade deal with the eu ( for europeans ) ends up with the same precise four freedoms built it . 
  no it does n't . 
  see : turkey . 
   only on worse terms than we currently have what are you basing that on ? 
  the referendum is status quo vs leave . 
   they want to leave . 
  they want to stay !, 
  where does this meme come from ? 
  we 're having a referendum in the next 2 years for certain . 
  until we have that referendum no one can say if we want to leave or stay , so these accusations of flip flopping are baseless . 
  she did a bbc show where she tracked down someone trolling her on twitter and confronted him . 
  it was hilarious . 
  talk about butthurt . 
  i see this * constantly * . . 
  this and the annoying cookie shit are the two bits of eu legislation that annoy me * literally every day * . 
  when people ask me what eu legislation really impacts my life in any meaningful way , well there it is . . those two . 
  not what we 're arguing here though . 
  we 're arguing whether that womans actions were nefarious or not .
