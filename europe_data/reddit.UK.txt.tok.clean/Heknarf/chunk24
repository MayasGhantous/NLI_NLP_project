  that 'd be embarrassing . 
  the government can not set the precedent that if you 're high profile you can avoid the law . 
  their hands were tied . 
  had he been a nobody , they 'd have been able to get away with not going after him like they have . 
  yeah , but pancake means something else to the vast majority of people . 
  we call it pancake day , but we eat crepes . 
  sweden is apparently a banana republic to assange supporters . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
   true he is in the uk but not under uk ` jurisdiction ' in the sense the uk can not just go in and do what they want . 
  we can . 
  we just do n't because it 's poor form and opens us up to the same bullshit abroad . 
  that 's why it 's convention , and not law . 
  he 's still guilty of skipping bail in the uk and costing us # 12m of bullshit police work . 
  iirc , that 's a 5 year max sentence that he 'll almost certainly get . 
  an example will need to be made . 
  you ca n't just hide from the law because you 're famous . 
  biggest problem here is that due to the way that [ european arrest warrants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_arrest_warrant ) work , if the usa asked sweden to extradite assange to the usa they 'd have to ask permission from the uk government first . . 
  which makes this entire convoluted conspiracy theory presented by assange completely absurd . 
  usa have to get us to agree to the extradition even if he 's in sweden , so why did n't they ask us directly for extradition . 
  why add another country and another legal system into the mix ? 
  it just adds needless complication . 
  [ swedish extradition treaty with usa ] ( http://www.mcnabbassociates.com/sweden%20international%20extradition%20treaty%20with%20the%20united%20states.pdf ) just for confirmation . 
  yes . 
  read the article , and the linked to tweet . 
  i really ca n't see any country involved in the brexit kicking anyone out . 
  we 'll likely introduce some form of extradited residency visa for eu citizens that already live here . 
  there 's 2.4 million eu citizens living in the uk . 
  turfing them out would impact the economy and wider society too greatly , so it wo n't happen . 
  peoples neighbours getting deported is politically toxic . 
  i imagine most eu countries will have a similar policy . 
  that would backfire so bad . 
  especially if they were hard on us and then we did okay . 
  nothing ceases . 
  that idea is completely mad , and i do n't understand why people keep repeating it . 
  it just becomes more costly . 
  that will obviously have an effect , but you 're looking at a relatively minor one . 
  it 's not like 40 % of our trade just ... 
  stops . 
  is n't this a bit of a sore spot , because services are n't part of the common market anyway . 
  at least not to the same extent as heavy industry , farming , etc is . 
  no , if scotland became an independent country it would impact international relations . 
  there 'd literally be an entirely new nation . . 
  someone recommended bacon and cheese the other day , so i 'm going to give that a go this year . 
  usually i go for sugar and lemon . 
  we do this on tuesday next week , and we eat crepes . 
  we also call it ` shrove tuesday ' . 
  life is a tom clancy novel to you . . 
  well the bbc found out before it was officially announced . 
  makes sense that assange would probably have a good idea of which way they were going to rule . 
   why did n't they agree that he would n't be extradited to the us no country can give that guarantee to someone . 
  countries ca n't make wildcard promises not to extradite people when they have extradition treaties in place . 
  what if it turns out that 15 years ago assange raped and killed someone in the usa . 
  dna matches and everything ... 
  but now he 's had a promise from sweden not to be extradited . 
  now he avoids punishment . 
  that 's why you ca n't hand out promises you wo n't extradite . 
  typical assange . 
  he knows how to push all the right buttons for his supporters . 
  starts off with the ` why ca n't they interview me in the embassy ? ', 
  even though he knows that 's not how sweden does things . 
  [ sweden eventually gives in and bends over backwards for assange and ecuador . . ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-14/sweden-reaches-preliminary-deal-to-question-assange/7025526 ) sweet , he can finally be questioned !, 
  [ ` haha , j/k . 
  changed our minds . 
  ' ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecuador-sweden-assange-idukkcn0uz18s ) now ecuador have be the ones questioning assange . . 
  which is obvious bullshit and no sane country would allow that . 
  how can anyone be on the side of assange after the amount of bullshit he 's been spewing ? 
  [ here 's another article for those who are still on the fence about assange . 
  ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/media/2012/09/legal-mythology-extradition-julian-assange ), 
  sweet , they can go back and tell all their mates how shit europe is . 
  why not ? 
  they 'd do it for the same reason we 'd do it . 
  kicking people out of a country who are established and have tried to make their home there is politically toxic . 
  newspapers would have a field day publishing about ` olga the nurse who married brit john smith , had twins , and is now getting kicked out of the uk . 
  david cameron , why are you splitting up familes ?! ' . . 
  also , it 's bad for the economy to kick out hundreds of thousands of people . 
  it 's bad on basically every level . 
  they 'd likely get the same treatment as eu nationals living in the uk would get . 
  expedited residency permits of some kind . 
   our [ canada ] politicians are not much better what complete and utter shit you are talking . . 
  that is a noble stance to take if you 're in a proper democracy that has fallen on hard times . . 
  but the hard times you'e experiencing are the fault of the actions of one man . 
  putin . 
  as it is , all you 're doing by staying is letting yourself get taken advantage of by your corrupt government . 
  all you 're doing is lining their pockets . 
  when putin has an estimated plundered fortune of $ 40bn + , think how much more money has been paid out to his cronies to keep quiet about it all . . 
  there 's nothing noble about that , imo . 
  if you 're a programmer , you could try doing some remote freelance work on a site like upwork.com . 
  build up a portfolio . 
  you write in english very well which sets you apart from the 50 % of people on that site . 
  why the hell are russians putting up with this shit ? 
  i could excuse them for ( broadly ) supporting putin if he was at least good at running the country . . 
  but he 's not . 
  just just a scumbag who is bleeding russia dry * and * running it into the ground . 
   many do the jobs british ( same can be said about other countries ) people do n't want to do ^ * [ * at the low prices businesses get away with paying immigrants . . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3xr98c/bank_of_england_report_concludes_that_mass/ ) if the jobs needed doing , the pay would just go up until brits wanted to do them again . 
  no one wants to end immigration . 
  the entire argument is about * low skilled * immigration . 
   david cameron makes zero sense . 
  he 's trying everything he can to keep us in the eu . 
  literally what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  stop making shit up .
