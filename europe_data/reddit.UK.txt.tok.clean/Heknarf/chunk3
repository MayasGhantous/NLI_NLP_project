  and it references article 77 of the lisbon treaty . 
  ** edit : ** [ some further reading ( pdf ) ] ( http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/98771 )  it is imperative to realise that due to the opt-out of the united kingdom and ireland , the external borders of the schengen area do not coincide with the ` external borders ' of the area in which there is free movement for persons having this right under community law . 
  likewise , the external borders of the schengen area , because of the association with the schengen acquis of norway , iceland , switzerland and liechtenstein , as well as the exclusion of the non-european territories of the schengen member states , do not coincide with the external borders of the eu . 
  it is the schengen external borders , as initially defi ned in article 1 of the schengen implementing convention ( cisa ) that form the object of community competence . 
  whilst at the schengen external borders , border procedures are regulated by ec law , ** at the non-schengen eu external borders it is the national law of the member state in question that determines the procedure to be followed ** , albeit within the limits imposed by eu law .8 it is also important to point out that the schengen external borders are defi ned by reference to the member states ' external borders . 
  the new article 69 ( 4 ) feu underlines once more that the powers currently contained in article 62 ec leave the competence of member states unaffected as regards the geographical demarcation of their borders , in accordance with international law . 
  ireland is not part of shengen . 
  the eu has no say in how ireland controls its borders . 
  it could have freedom of movement of people with america if it wanted . 
  the border argument is full on fearmongering , and nothing else . 
  make better arguments . 
  but i do n't get it . 
  ireland has a protected border with the rest of the eu , so why does it matter what they do internally ? 
  this * really * seems like a shengen issue to me , which ireland is n't a member of . 
  ** edit : ** [ this seems to back me up . 
  ] ( https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/brexit-theresa-villiers-misleading-on-return-of-border-controls-1.2613920 ) would only be an issue if ireland decided to join shengen , but i ca n't see why they 'd randomly do that after a brexit they 've been so opposed to it . 
  sometimes i just sit and stare at my wall . 
  if someone lives in ireland for 5 years just to get to the uk , then they 're welcome . 
  that 's a lot of time to live somewhere you do n't want to live , just to get to somewhere you do want to live . 
  they 've earned it . 
  why ? 
  i like ireland . 
  got family connections over there . 
  the tories are even bad at being tories . 
  nationalization of industry ? 
  the fuck am i reading ? 
  i have no clue . 
  well some of the british public are . . 
  can you point at any eu legislation , minus shengen , that tells eu members what to do with their borders ? 
  i feel like people value the ability to chuck people out more than actual border control . 
  i ca n't imagine any borders being put up . 
  eu citizens becoming illegal immigrants solves a bunch of brexiters qualms : 1 ) no benefits 2 ) harder for them to find work 3 ) can chuck them out, 
   it 's not simply about schengen . 
  it really is . 
  not in schengen ? 
  can literally do whatever the fuck you want with your borders . 
  we already have freedom of movement with ireland dating back since long before the eu even existed , and that would remain in place . 
  the eu has no say in uk/ireland borders . 
  in or out makes zero difference . 
  why would it become a hard border when ireland is n't in schengen ? 
  countries not in schengen can have or not have whatever border controls they want . 
  what if there were no dingos about ? 
  we promise to try to not be cunts . 
  same here . 
  ` what about ireland ' is actually quite high up my list of concerns . 
  last i heard a brexit is predicted to have a worse impact ( as percentage ) on irelands gdp than the uk 's . 
  business plan . . 
  both leave the eu , reform the uk to be a federation , ireland joins . . reuinite ireland and the british isles . 
  welcome , the united kingdom of great britain and ireland . 
  we wo n't be cunts this time . 
  nus is always doing stuff like this . 
  it 's full of fucktards , and only has members because its cards can get you money off drinks . 
  i 'll get in early and post this comment from another thread :  i wonder how many people commenting have actually read the article . 
  this is n't some check you are subjected to and now their not . 
  banks are required to do a lot of extra checks to `` politically exposed people '' and their families , to the point where a lot of banks wo n't offer accounts to these people because it 's too much hassle . 
   this is mainly aimed at dodgy officials in dodgy regimes around the world who try to use london to embezzle government money . 
  the uk government does n't really have an embezzlement problem as money is properly accounted for , departments audited etc. 
   however despite this mps had ended up on the list . 
   this just removes them and means they are subject to the same checks as any other uk citizen .

  i only use netflix for its originals , tbh . 
  i download everything else of torrent sites . 
  by the time it gets to uk netflix , i saw it 3 years ago . 
  i 'd cancel , but my brother and sister both use my account lol . 
  that does n't explain the bad council vote figures . 
  no ukip involvement there , but we 're much more often in the minority . 
  i 've seen york get mentioned a lot to tourists , although i 've never been . 
  york comes highly recommended too , although i 've never been . 
  guy 's an idiot . 
  i lived in brighton for 5 years and still work there . 
  we generally get a decent 3 months of summer . 
  we 've got bright blue skies today , for example . 
  best fish and chips is [ bankers ] ( http://www.bankers-restaurant.co.uk/ ) , imo . 
  brighton is way overpriced for what it is , though . 
  housing is extortionate , wages mediocre , and it 's losing a lot of its soul as it becomes more and more of an artisan shop mini london by the sea wankfest . 
  its fate was sealed when my banker uncle came down from london and said ` brighton is actually quite nice now . 
  not the dump i remember . ', 
  i honestly think someone will just take our place as the loudmouth euroskeptics . 
  in the ( imo , unlikely ) event of a brexit , there 's no winning play for the eu . 
  there 's no way to quell the euroskeptics . 
  * the eu is harsh on us , denies us everything , and we end up worse off economically ... well that shows hostility , and euroskeptics will feel like hostages and at least resist further integration . 
  * the eu is harsh on us , denies us everything , and we end up doing okay outside of the eu ... euroskeptics will start asking why the hell they 're even in the eu if it 's not needed to do well economically . 
  * the eu gives us everything we want after the exit . 
  remain in the common market , but with significantly reduced responsibilities ... euroskeptics will want the same baller deal . 
  if a brexit happens , the eu is checkmated to fuck . 
  yep , it 's a ridiculous prospect . 
  the snp will never even ask for a referendum if there 's a brexit because the cards are stacked so heavily in the favour of the ` remain in the uk ' camp . 
  1 ) scotland has a deficit bigger than greeces 2 ) scotland would have to either unilaterally use the pound , or create their own currency . 
  they could n't adopt the euro because there deficit is too high . 
  3 ) to bring down their deficit to acceptable levels to join the euro they 'd need to enact roughly 3 times the austerity that the tories have . 
  4 ) scotland hate the euro anyway 5 ) scottish people will likely be * really * fucking sick of referendums by then , and it 's possible people will switch to ` no ' to make sure another referendum does n't happen for a longer amount of time . 
  6 ) 65 % of scotlands exports go to england , wales and ni . 
  only around 15 % of their exports go to the eu . 
  so in the event of a nasty brexit , with tariffs imposed and all that jazz , scotland would be completely shooting itself in its foot by leaving the uk . 
  tariffs being applied to 65 % of their exports wo n't help with getting that deficit down !, 
  7 ) they 've got more powers to govern themselves now than they had in 2014 when they had the first referendum . 
  8 ) oil was at ~ $ 100 during the last referendum . . 9 ) lots of scots are now wary of claims the ` yes ' camp made , because they realise it 'd have been economic suicide if they 'd gone through with it and they 'd undoubtedly be worse off right now if they 'd voted to leave . 
   it 's not unthinkable that between now and the referendum , there will be one or two major terrorist attacks in europe . 
  what , in like 8 odd weeks ? 
  talk about a pessimist !,
