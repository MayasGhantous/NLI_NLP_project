  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_expeditionary_force_ ( world_war_ii ) #deployment read that and it might explain why we did n't go to war instantly after declaring war . 
  spoilers : we had nothing to go to war with . 
  we had a navy , and that was pretty much it . 
  [ like this post ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/424iet/calais_migrants_given_green_light_to_use_european/cz7ma0z ) educate * yourself * , son . 
  based on decisions from the echr , no ? 
  as in we made a law to conform to the echr rulings . 
  and i guess we can nullify the laws , and then just accept the fines from the echr . 
  farewell , goodbye , auf wiedersehen and goodnight . . 
  i wonder how bored i 'd have to be to try some paedophilia . . 
  the first example given :  if you want something at any price , you will do whatever you have to do in order to get it . 
  so :  paris would not agree to a deal with the uk at any price . 
  can mean :  ` paris would not agree to a deal , and they 'll do whatever they need to do to make sure of that . ', 
  they 'll do whatever they need to get ` it ' . . 
  the ` it ' being ` no deal ' . 
  and one of them is [ literally paedophile island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pitcairn_islands ) ... 
  oh , that 's really confusing . 
  sounds like a literal translation that 's gone a bit wrong . 
  if someone says ' i would n't do x for any price ' here in the uk it means there 's nothing you can give them to do it . 
  ` there is no price at which i would do what you want me to do . ', 
  for example : ' i would not stick my dick in a bears mouth for any price . ', 
  confusingly this : ' i would not stick my dick in a bears mouth for any old price . ', 
  means that there is a price that you could pay me to do it . 
  now the french have refused everything regardless , he might as well add the cap onto his list of demands . 
   that does not mean other countries have to accept all uk demands . 
  of course . 
  but flat out refusing them all with no discussion is pretty ridiculous , though . 
  especially when a lot of them are so minor that cameron only put them in for a symbolic win rather than them actually mattering . 
  yet the french wo n't even entertain those ones . 
  just a flat out no . 
  never going to happen . 
  26 military bases in european countries ? 
  [ it 's happppeeennnniiiinngggggg ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/the_british_empire_anachronous.png ), 
  well , looks like we 've secured polands vote on reforms . 
   as cameron said he is prepared to wait until next year to secure the right reforms , his french counterpart said that paris would not agree to a deal with the uk at any price . 
  why are the french always so fucking french about everything ? 
  we should just ignore it and accept the fines . 
  less costly in the long term . 
   in the past two weeks yeah , i do n't think the lady who wrote the article was complaining about behaviour that happened in just the last two weeks . . oh , and of course , if you do n't want to live in shit conditions then do n't illegally enter a country . 
  their entitlement is zero , as far as i 'm concerned . 
  if they 'd taken the legal route , they 'd probably be housed and living well . 
   that 's precisely what happens if you allow people to buy expensive tickets to europe . 
  that 's a very good point . 
  hahaha . 
  not hard to deport a refugee ? 
  that 's a good one . 
  watch the video above . 
  he explains it better than i ever could . 
  there 's other ways to deal with that though . 
  postal votes , for example . 
  they 'll probably use some of the weapons . . ugh . 
  and the winner is ... ` moot ' by a landslide victory !, 
  i do n't trust online or electronic voting at all . 
  i think [ tom scott ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oadmi ) makes a terrific argument against it . 
  and to get away from the technical argument against it , from a more human argument . . should people who ca n't even be bothered to visit a building near them once every 4 years even get a say ? 
  it 's just lazy . 
  if you ca n't even be bothered to do that , then you clearly do n't even really care either way . 
   i think that the complete exclusion from the international banking system that would be caused by removing a country from swift would only strengthen the resolve of people of that country . 
  it would also give said country a huge motivation to become a self sufficient economy , which could make them more powerful in the long term . 
  largely aligns with my opinion too . 
  mine is basically that if we used swift as a weapon then countries will start developing their own comparable systems . 
  and that would reduce * our * power . 
  that said , i 'm still suspicious of just how much you comment about russia lol . 
  ~ 165 mention of russia in a month of your comments . 
   swift should n't be a political tool . 
  why not ? 
  i mean , i agree . 
  but i 'd be interested to hear your reasoning . 
  we should have removed their access to swift and then whispered in his ear ` litvinenko sends his regards ' . 
  when did germany get a minimum wage ? 
  thought they were famous for not having one . 
  to be fair , you 're a french person attempting to downplay our significance . 
  i guess we 're a pair of walking stereotypes . 
  are medical degrees exam based ? 
  they could sit the exams . 
  whoops . 
  * industrial revolution * adam smiths economic theory * english is the worlds lingua franca, 
   before the british showed up , india 's economy was nearly 25 % of the world economy . 
  after the british , india dropped to 2 % . 
  china 's economy was nearly 32 % of the world 's economy . 
  after the british showed up , china dropped to 2 % . 
  but we started the industrial revolution . 
  how much of that drop in market share was them producing less , and how much was us producing more ? 
  seems disingenuous to just dump the figures like that when there 's clearly more to it than that . . 
  yeah , but we had 250 + years to rack up our stats . 
  the nazis had 13 , and had control over far less people . 
  the fact the stats are even comparable shows how bad the nazis were . 
  the scale was pretty impressive . 
  as was keeping it a secret . 
  we seem to be doing okay , to be honest . 
  how can it be ruining us when we have pretty much ideal levels of unemployment ? 
  was n't syria a decent functioning country up until quite recently ? 
  is a syrian degree from 2010 really worthless ? 
  we take in a lot of doctors from pakistan , for example . 
  pakistan does n't seem that much better than syria pre civil war . 
  camerons demands agreed to . 
   the latest german upgrade introduced among other things new cockpit hardware that is apparently too bright for night-time operations . 
  could surely be fixed with # 10 worth of tinted sellotape . . 
  boring and characterless home counties accent master race . 
  shittiest accent in the uk , imo .
