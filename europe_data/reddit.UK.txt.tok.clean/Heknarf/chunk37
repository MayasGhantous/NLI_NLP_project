   things are more expensive in canada and usa what bizarro world do you live in ? 
  no they 're not , unless you live in alaska or buttfuck nowhere canada . 
  if you 're earning $ 100,000 a year in the usa , healthcare is n't a worry . 
  your job will almost certainly be providing it for you . 
  the fact of the matter is , wages are just much lower in europe in general and certainly in the uk . 
  most professionals in the uk could cross the ocean and have a better quality of life . 
  snows in syria . 
  nice . 
  is ireland doing any tidal schemes ? 
   because it happened on new years , and most of the professional world does n't work on the 1st .

  well we spectacularly crashed out of the erm , lol .

  thank you based gordon brown . 
  dolla dolla bills y' all, 
   but implying there 's a relation is a bit far fetched . 
  no it 's not . 
  it was one of the features promised directly after the ellen pao drama . 
  can someone translate the code of conduct please ? 
  they mention it , what more do you want ? 
  do you want it to be the focus of the article ? 
  that 's not the bbc . 
  they do n't really do opinion pieces . 
  they just present the facts . 
  new feature added after all the ellen pao drama . 
  a much looser construct with nowhere near the power of the eu . 
  [ pretty sure mine was . . ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@50.8280822,-0.141321,3a,75y,148.86h,85.13t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sre9n92pv1ssaaaqqmufvjq!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ), 
  maybe it 's lost in translation , but it almost sounds accusatory . 
  as if it was the mayors fault . 
  er , one of the policewomen got attacked so there was a police presence . . 
  problem is that without riot police you do n't have a hope in hell of controlling 1000 men . 
  and the freaking guardian . . oopht . 
  given that the eu came into existence in the early 90 's , i do n't think that 's true . 
  it 's also been growing in power gradually since then . 
  because i 'm young and do n't get ill . and up until recently i could just walk into a walk in clinic and get seen . 
  although there 's not one of those where i live now , so i guess i should sign up to a proper doctors . 
  i 'm not really sure of the process . 
   and as a sovereign nation we have rights to pooh pooh them . 
  if we do n't mind racking up millions in fines . 
   brussles passes very few laws that effect the uk not true . 
  sad times . 
   how much do prescriptions cost ? 
  about # 8  do doctors treat you well ? 
  i very rarely go to the doctors . 
  last time was probably 5 years ago , and yes i was treated well . 
  i just walked into a walk in clinic looking like hell and without an appointment . 
  got seen 2 hours later . 
  this was because i 'd not signed up to a doctor , and i 'm still not signed up to one . 
  if i was , i could have got an appointment . 
   is universal healthcare worth the higher taxes you pay ? 
  it will be when i 'm older and i start falling apart . 
  i think even disregarding per capita we 're not in the top spot . 
   we are not being governed by brussles yes we are , to an extent . 
  just like scotland is governed by westminster , to an extent . . for someone complaining about people being ignorant of what the eu does , you seem to be pretty ignorant about what it does yourself . . 
   these people need to be kept out of europe or imprisoned for life . 
  do they ? 
  why ? 
  there 's tons of stories of people turning their backs on radical islam . 
  properly done , deradicalization should n't be too hard . 
  not when you can control every aspect of these peoples lives for a few years . 
  ah , good point . 
   maybe uk newspapers should focus how come that uk si currently largest supplier of isis terrorist after arab countries ? 
  not true . 
  it 's belgium . 
  also pretty sure that france is above us too . 
  glasgow ? 
  i know it 's gradually getting better , but surely it 's got to be edinburgh if you 're going for a scottish city . 
  i 'm sure we can create prisons/programs to stop this . 
  for example , only give them access to members of staff to talk to . 
  not other prisoners . 
  it was meant to be . 
  it was an analogy . 
  who will they trade with ?
