  i imagine if they 'd been told ` actually , a small province of 3 million people in fucking belgium can scupper the entire deal in the last few days before it gets signed ' they 'd probably have run the other direction . 
  i think it 's unrealistic for canada to be expected to know a rather strange quirk of belgiums government could lead to such a situation . 
   [ gdp annual growth rate in european union averaged 1.70 percent from 1996 until 2016 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/gdp-annual-growth-rate ) 1.7 % . . 
  does that even outpace population growth ? 
  ` look at all these things we 've always had that have never interested you ! ', 
  - every city trying to steal londons business, 
  i would like to personally thank wallonia for proving all the brexiters right . 
  and so promptly after the vote !, 
   and we 're doing fine erm . 
  surely wallonia will be just as keen to block ttip , if not keener . 
  if ceta is dead , ttip surely must be too . 
  or maybe they 're pissed that 7 years of effort was wasted when they could have put all those man hours to work on getting a trade deal signed with other less retarded countries/unions . . 
  racism means whatever nowadays . 
  should i compare my comment karma with vat or without ? 
  almost never . 
  dunno , but it melds pretty well with reddits definition since the vast majority of my comment karma comes from shitposting for laughs . 
  it 's the internet . 
  i was n't downvoting you until you mentioned it , now i 'm doing it because i know it gets to you . 
  sounds pointless for gauging the impact of the weakening pound . 
   good to see you have n't changed . 
  never , baby . 
  both ... for the uk ? 
  huh ? 
  the comparison between the usa and the uk is the entire point . 
  ca n't because sales tax varies all over the usa . 
  definitely wo n't be the same for commodity electronics . 
  only premium brands . 
  yes , but should tax really be included in the price ? 
  because last time i showed these workings with vat everyone bitched at me that i included vat . . 
  so i really ca n't win . 
  i think minus tax is probably the fairer way to make the comparison and represents the true cost of the product in the uk . 
  the fact that the government slaps on another 20 % is the governments fault , not external influences fault . 
  20 % , not 22 % . 
  it 's historically been more expensive in the uk . 
  it 's actually significantly less expensive now than with previous generations . 
  ** i actually did the workings at the time , and i 've updated them with todays rates : ** [ the 5s 64gb was # 590.83 ex vat ( # 709 ) on launch , which was september 20th 2013 . 
  ] ( https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/library/2013/09/16iphone-5s-iphone-5c-arrive-on-friday-september-20.html ) [ the 5s 64gb was $ 849 ex tax on launch , which was november 22nd 2013 . 
  ] ( https://9to5mac.com/2013/11/22/apple-starts-selling-unlocked-sim-free-iphone-5s-in-the-u-s/comment-page-1/ ) [ on november 22nd , 2013 the exchange rate was $ 1.62 to the # 1 . 
  ] ( http://uk.investing.com/currencies/gbp-usd-historical-data ) that means $ 849 represented # 524 . 
  that means we got a 12.75 % mark up compared to the americans . 
  now lets look at the us and uk iphone 7 . . [ top model iphone 7 ( not plus , not fair comparison ) is 256gb , and costs # 665.83 ex vat ( # 799 ) in the uk . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/09/07/apple-iphone-7-full-spec-key-features-uk-price-and-release-date/ ) [ in the usa , the same model costs $ 849 . 
  ] ( http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-7-price-how-much-will-apple-s-new-iphone-cost--1328097 ) $ 849 to gbp is # 695.91 . 
  that represents a mark * down * of 4 % for us brits . . 
  so we 're now paying much less than the americans , whereas we historically used to pay a lot more than the americans . 
  the reason for this is because apple products are a luxury brand , and they do n't adjust their prices based on exchange rates . 
  they price the iphone at the maximum their customers will buy it for . 
  exchange rate does n't come into the thought process . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i actually have no idea where it comes from , or what it means . 
  pretty sure it 's based in black london culture . 
   i will let someone else explain yoy why convenient , or lazy . 
  you decide !, 
  the more i hear about this wallonia place , the less i like it . 
  say that to my face and i 'll merk you fam . 
  or anywhere , liverpool or rome . . 
  protectionism wo n't work . 
  the world has moved on . 
  that can be fixed . 
   it 's not , nothing is illegal when you make the rules . 
  you literally have no idea what the wto is , do you ? 
  we 'd be the lowest tax rate major economy by a big margin . 
  that counts for something . 
  the eu ca n't single us out due to wto rules . 
  they 'd have to raise the tariffs uniformly for all countries they trade with via wto tariffs . 
  it 's not . 
  we wanted to sign trade deals without being held hostage by other countries on issues that do n't impact us . 
  the common example was italian tomato farmers holding up the australian trade deal , when we do n't give a fuck about tomatoes . 
  nope , argument is consistent . 
  you just misunderstood what i was saying originally . 
  we wanted to be able to sign ceta and ttip like agreements without having to worry about the concerns of a fucking province of belgium . 
  ah , the ` being a bunch of useless cunts ' tactic . 
  a classic government tactic . 
  that 's a crazy statistic on its own . 
  what 's the government doing to bring that down ? 
  we have different minimum wages depending on age . 
  helps encourage companies to hire younger people . 
  maybe that 'd help if you 're not already doing it . 
   it 's a sign that the people in europe want to keep their own faith in their own hands yet when we brexit for the same reason , we 're the bad guys . . 
  i really expected us to be ranked badly on this . 
  i 'm surprised the number is so high in so much of europe . 
  at 25-29 years old ? 
  the fuck ? 
  i do n't think a50 has anything to do with trade deals . 
  that 's always going to be separate unless we opt to remain in the single market . 
  scary things . 
  woooooooooooooo free trade . 
  wooooooooooooo, 
  trudeau dishing out some truth bombs . 
   no other country will sign a trade deal until we 've sorted out our relationship with the eu . 
  this just means a50 . 
  once we 're outside the single market we can get started on trade deals with everyone . 
  5 years is too optimistic . 
  i reckon that could be true in 10 years . 
  it 's a good thing that they take a long time . 
  we could likely stop following any eu laws we want now and there 'd be no chance of the ecj ruling against us before a50 was finished with . 
  we wo n't , but we could . 
  about 60 years late for that to still be true . 
  pls no ... 
  before , of course .
