  much more accurate analogy . 
   dr. oetker best frozen pizzas , imo . 
  and they 're # 1.50 on special offer pretty much always . 
  http://britishseafishing.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rs-european-union-eez-c-robert-laymont-1.png in terms of water , that seems to be incorrect . 
  but i guess some water has more fish in it than other water , so who knows . 
  yeah , i 'd be a getting a multi million pound pay day and probably front page retractions . 
  i could just fuck off to another country with my millions and retire . 
  there 's places in the uk mainland which could fall under the definition in that wiki article . 
  ask a yorkshireman what he thinks of yorkshire , for example . 
  i do n't know the ins and outs of what caused the u-turn , but i think it 's fair to assume it was the french . 
  maybe because it 's not a real thing ? 
  this is / r/europe not / r/eu . 
  i 'm not leaving , lol . 
  oh , and we 're not even the biggest nationality on this sub since it became a geo-default . 
  that is a very poorly sourced wikipedia page . 
  it uses 3 newspapers as its sources . . 
  i dunno , to me it sounds like he 's describing parliamentary sovereignty . 
  out of the 28 member states , only a few operate a similar system . 
  therefore i think there 's some truth to it beyond simple self-image . 
   we 've only ever got involved to prevent europe from uniting against us . 
  other than that , we 've always tended to leave them well alone . 
  seems like an argument to remain in the eu and meddle with it to try and morph it into something useful to us . 
  are you not a little worried about the impact leaving the eu will have with ireland/ni relations ? 
  and what about funding ? 
  eu sends a lot of money ni 's way . . do you trust westminster to allocate a similar amount using the eu fee savings ? 
  seems to me they 're more likely to just use it to help remove the deficit . 
   fishing - we have large and ( had ) resourceful fishing grounds . 
  screwed up under the eus watch . 
  it would be nice to see some of our dead seaside towns come back to life . 
  the impact of not having to be in the cfp is certainly something i 'm considering strongly when it comes to how i vote . 
   given britain 's success in the past , there is a certain arrogance where people assume our country will do well no matter what ( this is particularly prevalent on the political right ) . 
  this leads to a more take it or leave it attitude to the eu . 
  because we always tend to land on our feet . 
  we 've never had to behead our leaders ( france ) or lose two world wars ( germany ) . . 
  it 's one of the advantages to having a rather obvious ruling class . 
  no matter what us plebs do , they 'll sort it out somehow because it 's in their interest to . 
   it 's government has taken a thoroughly hands off approach at nearly everything . 
  tony blair attempted to force some reform on the cap by voluntarily giving up 20 % of our rebate . 
  then the eu was like ` haha , just kidding dickheads ' . . 
  it 's not really though lack of trying . 
  more through lack of will to get mugged off repeatedly . 
   at the same time it 's thoroughly involved with us spying operations . 
  psh , the us is involved in * our * spying operations . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b077nrb1/europe-them-or-us-1-an-island-apart get yourself a vpn and watch that . 
  explains it really well , imo . 
  are you kidding ? 
  what is jeering/laughing then ? 
  it possibly emphasises our cultural differences , if anything . . 
  very counter productive . 
  if anyone attempts this on me , i 'm voting out . 
  or it 'll strengthen the resolve of the no voters who do n't want neverendums . 
   oh , i know things are looking bad for them if they leave . 
  but what makes you think logic will prevail ? 
  because it did last time . 
   it was neck and neck before 45 % for , 55 % against is not ` neck and neck ' . . 
  i also forgot to mention the oil price , which was at ~ $ 100 a barrel when the referendum took place . 
   i mean , looking at the economic reality for the uk as a whole in the case of a brexit , things are uncertain at best exactly . 
  the scots would n't be biting at the chance to double down on the uncertainty . 
  scotland is n't going to leave the uk in the event of a brexit . 
  that 's just scottish nationalist and / r/europe boner fodder . 
  the snp wo n't even ask for a referendum in the event of a brexit . 
  not when you look at the economic reality of it all : * scotland has a larger budget deficit ( as percentage of gdp ) than greece * around 65 % of scotlands trade is with england , wales and ni . 
  the eu makes up just 15 % of its trade . 
  * currency issue still exists . 
  could n't join the euro due to the < 3 % budget deficit requirement . 
  * scotland has had more powers granted to them since the last referendum . 
  even less reason to leave . 
  scotland are not going to leave the uk just because they supposedly have a boner for the eu . 
  especially not when this boner for the eu only happened after the snp said that a brexit could trigger a referendum . 
  literally just nationalists trying their luck for a second referendum . 
  there 's no other reason for the opinion of the eu in scotland to rise between 2014 and now , when across the rest of the eu euroskeptisim has only grown with issues such as migration and greece . 
  that 's not an answer . 
  why would the uk break up just because we vote out of the eu ? 
   basically as of now the government can make a bill ( without vacatio legis ) saying that every member of the opposition should be publicly executed . 
  that seems like an overly emotive example . . 
  requiring a simple majority would have likely avoided the iraq war . 
   the empire !, 
  tired meme . 
   which is why i belive that if brexit happens , the eu will give britain a really shitty deal , to keep other countries from even thinking about exiting the eu . 
  that will enrage countries that deal with us a lot ( like ireland ) , and also just give euroskeptics more ammo . 
  same way people think what david cameron did was tax evasion . 
  the public do n't know shit about shit . 
  but they 're still willing to have strong opinions on stuff . 
  haha , and * we 're * seen as the troublemakers in this sub . . 
   it should be unanimous only when eu goes to war terrible idea . 
  basically means the eu never goes to war . 
  reminder , there were many european countries who appeased the fucking nazis . . 
  there 's no chance of getting a unanimous decision to got to war from that many countries , all with differing foreign policies . 
  ** reporter : ** ` there 's cars over turned , they 're on fire , it 's carnage here in paris . ', 
  ** news anchor : ** ` yes , yes . 
  but what about the terrorist attacks ? ', 
  that 'd get me to watch the superbowl . 
  well . . 
   you are free to control your borders as you wish . 
  can we deny access to eu nationals ? 
  i for one am * shocked * . . 
  the ties between scotland and the rest of the uk , both culturally and economically , are vastly more than the ties between the uk and the eu . 
  i think ` stay ' is going to win , but your argument is shitty . 
  2 leads to 1 . 
  that 's good .
