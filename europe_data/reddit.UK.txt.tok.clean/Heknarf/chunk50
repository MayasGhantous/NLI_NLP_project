  filthy casual . 
  it 's more fun to joke about how many presidents the eu has . 
  for the record , it 's 4 . 
  and one is a country . 
  bore off , nicole . 
  no we 're not , we 're a service economy ( 80 % ) and only a small percentage of that ( 10 % ) is finance . 
  also , the value of a currency does n't matter much in finance . 
  everything is an opportunity . 
  the vote is a start , in real terms . 
  75 % of businesses ? 
  that 's clearly ludicrous . 
  the vast majority of our economy is domestic . 
  only a relatively small ( about # 400bn iirc ) amount of our gdp is exports . 
  and only some of that is even to the eu . . 
  how many presidents does the eu have ? 
  i swear it 's a new name every time . . 
  yes , eu countries were n't stealing londons business purely because we 're mates . . lmao . 
  do you actually believe that ? 
  the reason they did n't steal londons business is because they could n't . 
  it 's the same as any industry . 
  whether or not they can now claw some business away by introducing regulation is to be seen . 
  but the idea that it was friendliness that allowed london to become so powerful is utterly ridiculous . 
  it happens in no other industry . 
  germany is n't the chief car maker in europe because every other eu country decided to let them be . 
  they have that status because they earned it by being the best . 
  same for london and finance . 
   who does care about the `` city '' ? 
  we can build the new financial hub anywhere within the eu . 
  alternative viewpoint : [ brexit : london can safeguard its global city status - ft.com ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/0ba694ba-4a9f-11e6-8d68-72e9211e86ab ) ( open in incognito to get around paywall ) relevant extract , although entire article is worth a read if you 're interested . 
  it 's not too long . 
   the global city function is made over time , and the process of making it is complex and multi-faceted . 
  and , even though it is highly digitised , it is situated in concrete places . 
   this also explains the proliferation of global financial centres . 
  we could have moved towards one global superfinancial centre , as many in the late 1980s thought we would . 
  i did not . 
  at the time , i saw three rising global financial centres -- new york , london and tokyo -- that were , crucially , quite different from one another . 
  eventually we saw a proliferation of global financial centres , each with its own specific specialised strengths . 
  in europe alone , london , frankfurt and paris are the leading centres , but they are very different in terms of specialist capacities . 
   it makes one think that it is to frankfurt 's advantage to keep london 's most complex financial functions in london .

  how do you think we feel ? 
  no matter what happens in the next 20 years , 48 % of the country will be claiming it 's brexits fault . 
  for you , it ends after a50 . 
  brexit is going to be our generations thatcher . 
  we got a proxy war on our hands boys !, 
  $ 1000 sleeping bags exist ? 
  how do they differ from , say , a $ 100 sleeping bag ? 
  a50 being invoked right away makes no difference . 
  a50 is going to be invoked , theresa may is clear on that . 
  as such , the level of uncertainty now is actually * higher * than if a50 had been invoked because we ca n't discuss what 's going to happen properly . 
  and it was uncertainty we were told was going to kill our economy as investors stop investing , businesses stop hiring , etc as they wait for certainty . 
  that has now been proven to be rubbish . 
  quizzing on no-go zones starts at 2:20 for anyone who wants to save some time . 
  still adds to the statistics , though . 
  probably worth it for you to keep filing the reports so that those statistics can maybe create policy in the future . 
  is a hassle though . 
  it very much is , to be fair . 
  it 's no longer even got a print edition . 
  it 's gone full buzzfeed , but with a hard lefty slant because that 's the buzzfeed demograpuc . 
  was n't that an increase in reports ? 
  apparently the violent crime rate in the uk in general is ~ 2000 per 100,000 people . 
  but the definition of ` violent crime ' is quite wishy washy . 
  saying threatening words is a violent crime , even if you never touch them . 
  and there was that famous case of someone throwing a biscuit at someone , which got recorded as a violent crime . 
  also included is stabbing someone in the neck with a broken bottle . . our statistics suck . 
  not really how nuclear weapons work . 
  no nuclear aggression , no nuclear response . 
  like how chemical weapons were n't used in ww2 , not even when things looked desperate . 
  i got you fam . 
  [ the hotline for reporting islam-phobia recorded a total of 158 cases of violence against muslims in the netherlands last year . 
  in 90 percent of these cases , women wearing headscarves were targeted . 
  ** 29 percent of those incidents involved physical violence . 
  ** in most cases the perpetrators were white men , according to the hotline 's annual figures . 
  ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/04/15/muslim-women-frequently-targeted-netherlands-hate-crimes/ ), 
  purely because they 're our biggest eu immigrant group . 
  they 're more likely to be around a cunt or gaggle of cunts that is looking for trouble . 
  i very much doubt these idiots know the difference between the languages . 
  [ sharp rise in racist incidents in the netherlands ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/12/sharp-rise-in-racist-incidents-in-the-netherlands/ ) yo wuddup . 
  [ `` racist '' : youths sorry for throwing baby formula at chinese people ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/01/26/racist-youths-sorry-for-throwing-baby-formula-at-chinese-people/ ) ayy , look at that . 
  [ turkish mosque vandalized in the netherlands ] ( http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2016/06/25/turkish-mosque-vandalized-in-the-netherlands ) gang of 15 smashing up a mosque ? 
  lovely . 
  [ syrian refugee 's calm response to dutchman 's racist rant ] ( http://observers.france24.com/en/20160530-video-syrian-refugee-racist-islam-calm-response-dutchman-rant ) i 'm sure he 's no real dutchman . . 
  i could certainly find * many * more examples if i could read and type dutch . 
  that 's the advantage the rest of europe has when demonizing us . 
  they can read our media , we ca n't read theirs . 
  i feel like we 've always had an underclass scum problem in this country , and brexit has just given them all some focus on who to target . 
  i 've been in fights because of the colour of my fucking hair before . 
  this country is littered with cunts that have nothing going for them , so they just walk around looking to make everyone elses lives miserable . 
  was n't it reports that increased ? 
  i think the jury is out on convictions . 
  could just be people reporting the crimes more , since brexit brought the issue of racism/xenophobia to the forefront of the british zeitgeist . 
  people who might have shrugged off ` fuck off home ya polish bastard ' before might feel more inclined to report it . 
  lots of the reports are merely verbal , for example . 
  33.5 million tourists visit the uk every year . . 
  your odds of getting hurt are minuscule . 
  there 's been a concrete increase in reports to police . 
  do n't think there 's any evidence convictions have gone up . 
  no doubt that the media is paying a closer attention as well . 
  it 's ` all the above ' basically . 
  hone your chav english accent for maximum safety .
