  david davis is . 
  he does n't seem any more competent than boris though , so your point probably still stands . 
  in practice , it will be a rubber stamping procedure from what i can tell . 
  if you read between the lines , it 's clear the power during a50 does n't lie with mep 's and the parliament . 
   well this basically removes any chance the uk will be in the single market without freedom of movement . 
  was never a realistic possibility , tbh . 
  and i say that as someone who voted leave . 
  we 'll be leaving the single market . 
  maybe we can get in on ttip as a third party if we 're shrewd and get the americans on our side . 
  i can see verhofstadt pissing off way more countries than just us , though . 
  germany tried that before . 
  did n't end well . 
  they used to be more like average labour voters until mass entryism when membership was opened up to anyone with # 3 . 
  i think people were pissed that labour managed to run a significant deficit during one of the biggest booms in british history . 
  it was very short sighted , and on top of that brown publically stated that the times of boom and bust were over . . 
  we can all agree he made some pretty big mistakes . 
  and why does this matter ? 
  politics is n't everything . 
  yeah , but it takes about 5 seconds to report this thread . 
  it 's hardly a high energy action . 
   every attempt to fix this gets destroyed by progressives . 
  the id card system was an utter shitshow . 
  they wanted to link it to iris , finger prints and dna . 
  and they wanted to cross reference those things to solve cold cases , which if you know anything about how shoddy finger print evidence really is , should worry anyone progressive or not . 
  on top of that , they wanted to sell the data to private companies . 
  shit . 
  show . 
   they have relatives in the uk not convinced of this , although i hear it repeated often . 
  in all the videos i see of interviews , it almost never comes up . 
  speed . 
  i 'm fine with paying for it . 
  a 10,000 person detention camp would be huge and expensive , no ? 
  where do you put it , and how much does it cost ? 
  i imagine those are the driving factors . 
  also , ` papers please ' will have the left foaming at the mouth . . 
   we have nothing in common with them hyperbole much ? 
  we 're incredibly similar . 
   law not entirely true . 
  implying i can only be angry at one person or institution at a time . 
  no , the uk is . 
  thought that was pretty obvious . 
  hard not to be uptight over the potential breaking up of my country , to be fair . 
  article was given flair that said :  sexit  brexit, 
  appreciated . 
  can we at least keep the flairs non-politically motivated ? 
  irks me a bit that a subreddit is officially supporting the break up of my country . 
  you got any more information on that ? 
  # 8.4 bn seems way too high . 
  scotland does n't only generate # 3.6 bn in taxes . 
  our moat kept hitler and his war machine out . 
  i 'm sure it can keep out a few migrants . 
  i think he meant send them back to germany . 
  hon hon hon. 
  put them on a plane to a friendly safe african country we bribe with a few billion in foreign aid . 
  they 'll soon make their way home when they realise they 're not getting to the uk . 
  the snp are a bit fishy if you ask me . 
  the economic case for leaving the eu was kinda shitty . 
  the economic case for leaving the uk just simply does n't exist . 
  not all referendums are born equal , and you really ca n't compare the two if you genuinely know anything about either . . 
  it 's risk/reward . 
  leaving the eu is n't anywhere near as risky for the uk as leaving the uk is for scotland . 
  it 's a whole different ballgame . 
   would you say most scottish people identify themselves as british , not scottish ? 
  or both ? 
  i think the majority identify as scottish/british , then british/scottish , then just scottish . 
  i think the first two make up the bulk of people in scotland though . 
  people who only see themselves as scottish are in the minority . 
  to be fair , that # 12bn or so is n't just a gift . 
  scotland pays taxes to the uk , then the uk gifts the money back via the barnett formula . 
  the problem is that while scotland raises more taxes per head than the ruk , it 's not enough to counter the much higher government spending in scotland . 
  so there 's still a good gap of a few billion . 
  just not the # 10bn you made it sound like . 
  well london clears more dollars than new york city does , so it clearly has something to offer outside of the eu . 
  hard brexit makes it so much harder for sturgeon to win a second referendum . 
  scotlands trade is 65 % with the rest of the uk , and only 15 % with the rest of the eu . 
  the economics of scottish independence are already incredibly shaky in the eye of the electorate . 
  add tariffs being imposed on 65 % of trade and it makes the referendum damn near unwinnable . 
  she 's trying to * really * sell the importance of the eu , but she 's going to get absolutely destroyed by reality if she calls a referendum in a hard brexit scenario . 
  scottish love for the eu is not ideological , it 's practical . 
  as soon as it 's not practical , support will plummet . 
   independency has never gone wrong for any country in the last century in europe . 
  usually because it meant escaping the clutches of fascists and/or communists . 
  [ who do i believe ?? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/nicola-sturgeon-shelves-quick-second-scottish-independence-referendum-bill ), 
  rely is a strong word . 
  obviously it 's advantageous , but even outside of the eu we 'll still be the financial centre of europe for a long time . 
  this is why i find it kind of stupid how people were using * fifteen * year predictions by economists to try and win the argument for remain . . 15 years is a ridiculous amount of time to attempt to predict something as chaotic as an economy . 
  i said the best , not the wurst . 
  there 's nothng wrong with wanting to be the best . 
  just bandwagoning . 
  black live matter exists in sweden too , so i guess not . 
  all these protesters were white , lmao . 
  one black bloke , and it was a taser accident . 
  they did n't mean to kill him . 
  and one white bloke , who was waving a handgun around so hard to feel too sorry for him . . 
  well it can certainly ban brits from coming without jobs . 
  kicking out brits already in the eu would be scummy as fuck and not at all a ` like for like ' response . 
  ** mp1 : ** 4.1 million is less than 17.4 million . 
  ** mp2 : ** i concur . 
  ** speaker : ** alright , that 's a wrap .
