  if we start fining eurostar for every illegal immigrant that gets on board it 's the french government who will ultimately be picking up the bill . 
  going to be honest , i know a few nigerians and they 're the friendliest people . 
  just so fucking jolly . 
  no idea what their politics is like , mind . 
  but from a superficial stand point , they seem pretty cool . 
  turks seems a bit more broody . 
  it takes 2 years to tear up the treaty that puts our border in france . 
  we 'll create a processing facility for them in that kind of time frame . 
  they wo n't be allowed to mince around free like in france . 
  they 'll be detained . 
  i love how the eu is apparently this amazing marvel of a thing , but the idea of giving us a mutually beneficial deal is allegedly enough to kill it . 
  if us getting an acceptable deal is enough to make other members leave , then what the hell is the point of the eu ? 
  it seems ridiculously fragile , if what that german minister says is true . 
  the economic case for leaving the uk has been mostly destroyed though . 
  that will counter any eu love , and i 'm not even sure that the eu is loved enough to swing the vote much anyway . 
  scots just like to play it safe in general . 
   the only reason i have n't already been living in sweden fill time is coming back to university in scotland to get my degree . 
  so it actually has nothing to do with brexit , you were always going to move to sweden but you wanted to pretend it 's because of brexit to make it seem more important and righteous ? 
  enjoy your greener grass . 
  we never elect pm 's though . 
  we elect mp 's of parties who elect their leader who becomes pm . 
  it 's representative democracy . 
  on the internet , one does n't know you 're a queen . 
   you are n't important enough you ca n't know that for sure . 
   people have to justify themselves to you now ? 
  now , and always . 
  this is such a stupid line of fucking questioning . 
  i 'm going to stop replying . 
   practical use ? 
  like what ? 
  what practical use do ** sun ** glasses have ? 
  are you retarded ? 
  because they have a practical use . 
  i live in a flat . 
  not getting an electric car any time soon . 
  burqa is awful . 
  literally puts up a physical social barrier . 
  utterly counter productive to integration . 
  i do n't mind the other ones that show the face , though . 
  not really any different from a hoodie . 
  are n't school shootings usually by students ? 
  so you teach the students what to do , you inevitably teach the shooter what to do too . . 
  so sad that these are the times we live in . 
  #high energy norway, 
  can confirm . 
  i broadly supported it , and now i think it 's fucking dumb . 
  this seems just really odd . 
  surely it only matters if it 's covering the face , otherwise what 's the difference between wearing normal clothes on the beach and wearing what that womans wearing ? 
  hey guys , here 's some fun threads to read through from back when david cameron proposed this exact same thing , which was then touted as ` banning encryption ' to much mocking on here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bqs65/david_cameron_is_going_to_try_and_ban_encryption/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2sx5po/eu_body_enisa_recommends_strong_encryption_the/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3r9na1/uk_internet_firms_to_be_banned_from_offering/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ukbr8/uk_surveillance_bill_includes_powers_to_limit/ some particularly fun comments :  sorry , it 's too late . 
  we can only hope for a timely brexit so your idiocy wo n't infect the rest of europe . 
  - german . 
   another reason we should never leave the eu . 
   the uk is becoming more and more disgusting . 
  - cyprus . 
   as if there were n't enough reasons to kick him out of the union . 
   brits must have skipped orwell during learning course . 
   uk never cease to amaze me with their clear guilty before proven innocent lawmaking and political agenda . 
  cctv everywhere , storing users data for a long time , no privacy for any citizen , no foreigners please etc. 
  what is going on over there ? 
  i am a norwgian that once contemplated moving to england ( because i like brits ) , but the last years massive survellance and auto incrimination and foreign hostility have firmly made me stay away , even for vacation purposes . 
  - norway feel bad for that last guy . 
  not going to be able to go to holiday anywhere good in europe :(, 
   and do n't even get me started those stupid track-cycling events . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  track cycling is amazing to watch . 
   women 's soccer  events the people care about are you trolling ? 
  i liked the funny aussie article about our team :  and the really worrying thing ? 
   none of the poms over here are giving us a hard time about it . 
   they simply could n't be bothered . 
  they 're too busy playing with the whales to engage in childish banter with a minnow . 
  oh ok , so we 're not a minnow quite yet . 
  a cod maybe , or a small bream . 
   seriously , when i looked up australia on the medal table we were n't on the first page of the official website . 
  i had to click on `` other countries '' . 
  since when did we become an `` other country '' for crying out loud ?

   the french want a turnaround ahead of the 2024 games , which they hope to get for paris . 
  this is going to be fun . 
  i 'd like both . 
  wonder when we 'll give up on this sticky . 
  no one ever posts in it . 
  [ y u do this .

  you did n't really answer the question . 
  would you say grenada has better athletes than the usa ? 
  if someone said that you had to find some world class athletes , would you book a plane to grenada right away ? 
  no , but if i had to then it 'd be ireland most likely . 
   field hockey denied . 
  as is tradition . 
  i did n't want to know anyway . . 
  [ i got you fam . 
  now you 're talking !, 
  but would you say grenada has better athletes than the usa ? 
  does n't the ferrari have launch control ? 
  did n't hear it . 
  there 's nothing wrong with scripting the break down , because it never broke down on the show . 
  they quite clearly say it run out of battery . . 
  whether it actually ran out of battery is completely irrelevant , as the point they were making is that battery tech has limitations . 
  and one of those limitations is that when it runs out of juice , you 're a bit fucked as there 's no quick way to get it going again . 
  he called that bigoted women a bigot .
