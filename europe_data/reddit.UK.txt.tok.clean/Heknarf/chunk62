  ` when you nut but she still suckin ', 
  reminds me of the ` transport ' section of corbyns website that is literally just a picture of a train . . http://jeremycorbyn.org.uk/priorities/transport-2/, 
   does he not realise that - let me explain . 
  he is jeremy corbyn . 
   did he really think we could get away with putting he warheads on an icbm ? 
  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/17/jeremy-corbyn-trident-compromise-no-nuclear-warheads he said they do n't have to have nuclear warheads , so unless he 's insinuating a chemical warhead he must have been thinking of traditional he . 
  stop jinxing it , stop jinxing it , stop jinxing it , stop jinxing it , stop jinxing it , stop jinxing it . . 
  most in totals , or as a percentage ? 
  uk/france/italy / germany will always win on totals . 
  either spanish or german , imo . 
  i 'm going entirely off my tinder , to be fair . 
  people on there claiming to be swedish are always distinctly average . 
  german or spanish , they tend to look nice . 
  i live in a tourist city , so i get a decent spread of europeans . 
  not really . 
  ~ 80 % is completely average . 
  currently third on the front page ( 43 points ( 81 % upvoted ) ) :  https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4yhvor/jeremy_corbyn_refuses_to_say_he_would_defend_nato/ and with 45 upvotes :  yeh if he 's still in charge in 2020 there 's no way i 'm voting labour . 
  and all the upvoted top level comments are criticising him . 
  [ the only demographics in the uk that favours corbyn over may , is the 18-24 demographic and scotland ( only by a bit ) ... ] ( https://twitter.com/britainelects?ref_src=twsrc%5egoogle%7ctwcamp%5eserp%7ctwgr%5eauthor ), 
   but her track record on privatizing public services is outright atrocious . 
  such as ? 
  i 'll take the tories over a corbyn lead labour 10 times out of 10 . 
  no competition . 
  also , may looks genuinely promising as pm . 
  she 's posturing to take a centre ground that labour once inhabited . 
   we really need to get corbyn in a fucking room for few hours to bring his ass up to speed on some things , because this shit ai n't helping . 
  please do n't . 
  the longer he keeps saying idiotic shit , the less electable he becomes . 
  hindsight is 20/20 . 
  the german military was vastly overestimated at the time , which is why that did n't happen . 
  that 's really not fair on chamberlain . 
  even churchill respected chamberlain for what he achieved . 
  welcome to the british left . . where nothing is thought through , and the policies do n't matter . 
  corbyns fans have come to the rescue when it comes to that blunder and said we could put standard he warheads on the trident missiles . 
  which is stupid on so many levels . 
  1 ) a sub based ballistic missile system is expensive as fuck . 
  there 's much better ways to deliver standard high explosive . 
  2 ) a ballistic missile looks like any other ballistic missile . . 
  there 's no way to tell if they 're carrying a nuke . 
  they all look alike on radar , and that 's obviously dangerous . 
   why do so many people in your country love him ? 
  that 's what i do n't get . 
  they do n't . 
  he 's polling spectacularly badly . 
   / r/unitedkingdom is essentially / r/corbynislife . 
  / r/unitedkingdom has never had an election or referendum go their way . . 
  in a survey during 2015 , there were more green voters than tory voters . . that said , / r/unitedkingdom is n't particularly pro corbyn . 
  to all europeans out there , do n't worry too much . 
  this stance is political cancer in the uk . 
  basically no one is on his side on this , so he 'll never make it into power . 
  literally the entire cycling team is white british . . 
  there 's no difference . 
  those two words mean the same thing , essentially . 
   nobody is wishing for a bad outcome . 
  [ reading comments on this sub determined that was a lie . . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tivzcgq.jpg ), 
  define ` best ' though . 
  lots of our cyclists do n't do that well on the world stage outside of the olympics . 
  jason kenny has almost no accolades outside of the olympics . 
  would they get picked by any bureaucratic eu department with biases ? 
  then there 's relative unknowns who just happen to medal . 
  no one expected our gymnasts to do as well as they have , for example . 
  not even our gymnasts . . then there 's sports where luck plays a big role , and the difference between gold and bronze is very small . 
  where it really depends on form on the day . 
  entering a shit ton of athletes gives a * huge * advantage . 
  oi , get our medals out of that total !, 
  they 're ours !, 
  also , this is bull . 
  how many athletes has the eu entered ? 
  i 'll tell you ... a fuck load more than we 'd have been allowed to if we 'd entered as a single eu . 
   this isnt about banning encryption , this is about regulating a defacto communication service like a well like a communication service . 
  that 's * exactly * the same as what our government is trying to do . 
  the media and reddit just spun it as ` lol trying to ban encryption ' . . 
  i want us to leave the eu and do well , just for the salt i can mine from this subreddit . 
  we took one for the team twice , if i remember correctly . . 
  no one knows what the reality of brexit is yet . 
  we 've not even defined what brexit will even be . 
  when you gunna leave the eu and come join us ? 
  haha , i remember people on here laughing because our government was supposedly ` banning encryption ' because they were attempting this . . now what , / r/europe ? 
  ignorance of the law is n't an excuse for breaking it . 
  it 's on them to get clued up , just like i do when i go to other countries . 
  boxing is pretty working class and we do alreet . 
   that we care about the empire . 
  i see it discussed on reddit all the time , but it 's very misguided . 
  only time i ever bring it up is for the banter . 
  there was also a hell of a lot of people who supported the vichy government . . 
  okay , we do have some shit food . 
  but our cuisine is still better than a fuckload of other european countries !, 
  i fully agree with you . 
  more people you put in , the more chance of getting medals you have . 
  the olympics is full of randomers no one rated getting silver/bronzes and sometimes golds . 
  do n't think anyone expected our trampoline gymnast to get gold , but she did . 
  happens all the time . 
  more people you get to enter , more of those ` performed best on the day ' people you get . 
  i 'd like to see a table that weighs them : gold = 3 silver = 2 bronze = 1, 
  it 's all about the golds . 
  it was a guaranteed gold and silver for team gb . 
  it was gb vs gb in the final , lol . 
  looking like the same might happen for the womens sprint too . 
  i think we 'll do better than that . 
  still come in third of course , but i think we can rack up more than 19 golds .
