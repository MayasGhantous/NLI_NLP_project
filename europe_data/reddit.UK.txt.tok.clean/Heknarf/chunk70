  man , you have such a chip on your shoulder . 
  every . 
  thread . 
  well we apparently grow about 50 % of our food . 
  is the drop from 50 to 25 % ( or whatever ) really going to make us any less fucked if the world decides to blockade us ? 
  that sounds complicated and expensive . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jersey_barrier could just install a bunch of those in a way which makes picking up any kind of speed impossible . 
  however it requires you to know well ahead of time where crowds of people will be , and from what i can tell protests and such tend to crop up quite fast and without warning in france so there 's always going to be a vector of attack for a nutter with a lorry who wants to do damage . 
  driving a lorry into the crowd . . how can you even respond to that ? 
  the barrier to entry is so incredibly low for such an attack . 
  you only need to either buy , rent or steal a lorry and drive it into a crowd . 
  takes maybe a few days of planning and a grand or two . 
  maybe hollande should just come out and say ` look , there 's no reasonable way to defend against such low effort attacks . 
  truth is , if someone wants to kill a bunch of people it 's pretty easy to do and there 's no policies i can make which will stop them . ', 
  they 'd pull a jaime lannister for sure . 
  they were actually all zeros for a period of time , haha . 
  they 're apparently not any more . 
  yeah . 
  he 'd have a nato missile up his arse in under 2 hours if he ever attempted such a thing . 
  spoiler , the code is the same as my luggage . 
  we might be a joke , but we 're at the top of the food chain . 
  if we 're a joke , everyone else is a bigger joke . 
  were the jets even under control of the coup-ers ? 
  did n't they end up shooting down a helicopter that was part of the coup ? 
  can you explain the ar-15 meme to me ? 
  first step of any half decent coup is to shoot the current leader square in the face . 
  if you 're not willing to do that , you 've already lost . 
   getting your news and opinions only from reddit do n't do that . 
  ** america : ** that 's cute . 
  short shares in vw . 
  i believe it is a blanket rule . 
  there 's no exceptions as far as i 'm aware of . 
  bruh ... we ca n't support coups of democratically elected leaders any more . 
  it 's not the 50 's . 
  why start a coup with the president out of the country ?!, 
  first step is to detain or kill the president , no ? 
  you need to create the power vacuum to fill . 
  i mean , there must be times where the president visits the military . 
  use that chance . 
  during article 50 ... would we get the option not to leave ttip if it was completed before we leave ? 
  it 's like riding a bike for them , i imagine . 
  so so fucked . 
  step 1 ) coup step 2 ) install puppet government step 3 ) rush through needed eu reforms , and apply for membership step 4 ) get membership to the eu step 5 ) ` see , i was n't lying ! ', 
  - boris johnson, 
  tbh , we 're long over due for masterminding a coup . 
  everyone does * not * like corbyn . 
  every time before , it 's worked . 
  because no one 's ever been so stupid as to try and be the leader of a party where literally 3/4 of the mp 's want them gone . . 
  corbyn is like that dog in the ` this is fine ' comic . 
  that 's not how we do it this side of the channel . 
  we create problems with ideas , and then find solutions . 
  how much of that is because of recent arrivals ? 
  it 's generally not the immigrants that are the problem , it 's the kids they have . 
  i voted leave and do n't give a fuck about immigration . 
  i 'd be up for eea membership . 
  got a bunch of europoor gold in our vaults , if that sways you . 
  make you a good deal . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm an ideas man , dammit . 
  no shit . 
  we 've not had to negotiate trade deals for 40 odd years . 
  give us time to get our cheque book out . 
  if only there was some english speaking country just off the coast of the eu , but not in the eu . . 
  no flags ?!, 
  2 more before the year ends ? 
  i think it 's possible . 
  never had much trouble with this in the uk tbh . 
   empire foreigners are fucking * obsessed * . . 
   i 'm not sure you can complain about that because as a recent example the uk vetoed raising duties on chinese steel imports , even though the chinese have been aggressively dumping it and with it jeopardizing thousands of jobs in the uk . 
  this is why i find the people on here claiming we 're going to revert to protectionism outside the eu mad . . 
  this is such rubbish . 
  it 's clear from the context of those tweets that he was just making a point that individual eu members have a vested economic interest in us striking an eu wide deal . 
  sometimes i can see the way the conversation and votes are going , and i just help it along a little . 
  oh my god . 
  for fuck sake , it 's taking the piss now . 
  do you know where i can see dougan talk in at the select committee ? 
  ** boris : ** ` can you hear them ? 
  they 're shouting my name !, 
  booooo-ris , boooooooo-ris , they 're saying ! ', 
   well then you lot should 've voted the other way then , you bunch of plebs !, 
  why ? 
  the referendum was a decision on which way to steer our country . 
  it did n't say ` leave the eu in 2 years time exactly ' . 
   i do n't want to hear anymore about fucking england and brexit . 
  you 're fucking my country up too !!, 
  relax . 
  so what , you might only get 18 % gdp growth next year instead of the 25 % odd you got this year . 
  you 'll do fine . 
  we need to tread carefully around the issue of ni too , so maybe yolo leroy jenkinsing this shit is n't the best plan ? 
  not forever , obviously . 
  december is way too quick if we want it done properly . 
  i was thinking april or around then . 
  melds well with our financial year , and we should have been able to hire the required civil servants by then . 
  not even factoring in coming up with a fucking plan . 
  the eu should have thought about that before they offered no concessions to cameron . 
  this was all preventable . 
  even the smallest of leeway probably could have swayed a mere 2 % to vote differently . . 
  civil service is nowhere near ready according to most in the know . 
  aggressive how ? 
  3 years tell this guy ' i told you so ' .
