  she 's going to attempt to go for eea with a limit of freedom of movement , but she 'll get nowhere . 
  she 'd be silly not to try , though . 
  so yeah . 
  a fta with the eu wo n't be ironed out in 2 years , so wto for a while seems quite possible . 
  * another * possibility , and something the americans have suggested , is that we could join in on ttip . 
  we 've already helped craft it to 95 % completion . 
  david davis is one of the most rebellious mp 's in the house of commons . 
  not sure that goes well with a cabinet position . 
  oh look , we 're getting compared to ( the precursor to the ) nazis . . how novel . 
  that low ? 
  leave almost entirely consisted of fringe mp 's , mep 's and random non politicians . 
  gove and boris were the only people who had a chance of actually implementing any plan they created . 
  boris did n't have a plan because he 's fucking boris . 
  a dumb cunt , by most accounts . 
  and gove might have had somewhat of a plan , but his party hates him . 
  he never stood a chance of being leader as long as people opposed him . 
  3 years make sure to mine this guys salt . 
  has merkel shown interest on continuing as chancellor past 2017 if elected ? 
  if so i reckon we 'll just wait until after the french elections and then invoke article 50 . 
  do n't see merkel losing . 
  so salty . 
  so so salty . 
  i mean hold off on invoking article 50 all together . 
  i do n't mean invoking it and then attempting to make it last longer . 
  corporation tax is regressive shite anyway . 
  multinationals structure themselves to not pay it , and the little domestic businesses have to pay it . 
  i 'd be quite happy seeing corporation tax fall to 0 % . 
  we might use those elections to string it out a bit longer . 
  could see may committing to invoking article 50 a week or 2 after the elections , for example . 
  that gets rid of a lot of the uncertainty . 
  no one really expected ` leave ' to win . 
  especially not cameron and co. . plus the government not having a plan for brexit was * meant * to sway people to vote remain . 
  coming up with a plan and preparing risked having more people vote ` leave ' . 
  we 're not denmark . 
  yeah , article 50 wo n't be invoked this year . 
  going to take us until early to mid next year to bolster our civil service enough to handle the workload . 
  we wo n't invoke article 50 until we have the capacity to deal with it . 
  no it did n't . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_customs_union, 
  smaller percent of a bigger pie . 
  there 's no need for corporation tax reduction to reduce tax income . 
  members of the eu customs union : 32 members of the eu : 28 i think we 'll be alright . 
  no need for a border . 
  jeez . . 
  i remember manchester getting blown to fuck if that counts . 
  the good friday agreement is n't going anywhere , because no one wants it to go anywhere . 
  we 've had peace in ireland for 15 + years now . 
  no one 's interested in going back to how it was . 
  we 'll draft a new slightly altered agreement if the eu is really as pivotal as you make out , but i 've not seen any proof it is . 
   if you 're truly an ally then why do you still occupy part of ireland ? 
  the internet brings out all the crazies , eh ? 
   uk ad eu close allies ? 
  of course we do , you muppet . 
  your country is one of them . 
  you think you can get every country in the eu to vote to remove us just because we 're stalling for time ? 
  ireland would never go for that for starters , and our allies in the eu do n't end at ireland . 
  normal speed it is then . 
  normal speed being entirely up to us as no one 's ever done this before . 
  no , how many have to agree to kick us out . 
  and in terms of the deal negotiated during article 50 , it only needs a qualified majority to approve of it . 
  55 % of member states representing 65 % of the population of the eu . 
   why do the eu have to offer anything . 
  because they want it done fast ? 
  i thought that was obvious . 
  ** if ** they want it done fast , they must offer something in exchange for that . 
  if they do n't , then we 'll just got at our standard pace which can be whatever we like because there 's no precedent . 
  not that wee . 
  about half the size of london . 
  how many have to agree ? 
  no need to get bent out of shape . 
  i 'm just telling it how it is . 
  the eu can make this happen very fast if they want , but they 'd have to offer something . 
  otherwise it 'll be a drawn out affair like all such negotiations are . 
  we 're setting our country up for decades to come with this deal . 
  we can afford to wait for as long as it takes to get the deal we need . 
  a few extra years of economic woe is peanuts in the grand scheme of things . 
  2 years is not a lot of time to negotiate such a thing . 
  it 's almost like governments differ . . 
  lol , kicking out a country because of the result of a non-binding referendum . 
  haha , okay . 
  best of luck with that . 
  proper negotiations like this naturally take a long time . 
  only way to shorten them is to offer one party everything they want . 
  either we can do that , or the eu can do that . 
  we 're not going to , so if the eu wants it over fast they 'll have to . 
  otherwise we 'll just go at standard governmental snails pace while we get everything in order . 
  i 'm sure may would be willing to go at breakneck speed . . 
  but the eu will have to give her a reason to . 
  if the eu wants to get this over and done with asap then it 'll need to offer adequate concessions . 
  this is quite the departure from cameron and thatcher . . 
  literally only ever hear french people on here shitting over gdp as a measure of success . 
  ** closing loopholes : ** https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-avoidance-general-anti-abuse-rules https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/google_tax ** one time deals : ** https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/29/googles-tax-deal-with-the-uk-key-questions-answered-chancellor-taxes, 
  bit of all of that . 
  reducing tax does n't necessarily reduce tax income . 
  the tories have been cutting taxes consistently during their 6 years and tax income has only gone up each year . 
  daaaamn . 
  nice . 
  i 'm guessing there 's a lot of business based around servicing the multinationals . 
  lawyers , finance , etc. 
   consumer spending rose by 4.5 per cent last year . 
  is n't that quite a lot ?
