  presumably that means if someone does decide to sue , you 're e fucked . 
  i 'd rather get easy sued , i think . 
  that 's the likelihood , imo . 
   ** if and when ** these companies do move some jobs to ireland i like you . 
  i think you 're the first person on here to recognise that it 's not as certain as people like to make out . 
  have you considered building a wall ? 
  make the east berliners pay for it . 
  i know a guy who can hook you up . 
  is that why it 's considered to be quite poor ? 
  londons population is , what , 30 times bigger than icelands ? 
  could be dangerous . 
  how easy is it to set up a company , pay taxes , etc ? 
  and whats your legal system like ? 
  can legal issues be resolved promptly and fairly ? 
  one of the biggest draws of the uk is english common law . 
  london must fall . 
  disregard logic , act on emotion . 
  are you exaggerating or is it really that bad ? 
  could have been a homeless man on the street calling us dumb and it 'd have got upvoted on here . 
  it 's one of those internet may mays . 
  beat * that * tony blair !, 
  i 'm suspicious of anyone who says ` plain and simple ' when discussing the law . 
  same . 
  i do n't understand it at all . 
  it 'll be funny if someone legally challenges having their eu citizenship taken away and wins . 
  stranger things have happened . 
  would be funny to see this sub collectively lose their shit as all brits born after x date get to keep freedom of movement , but it would n't be reciprocal . 
  referendums for everyone !, 
   which now appears no one wanted . 
  the 52 % who voted leave does n't real ? 
  i 'll miss seeing them all in their weird fluffy hats and trench coats when i visit north london . 
  they seem to never be going anywhere , though ? 
  they 're the kings of loitering . 
  so not even all the remain voters ? 
  lol . 
   pessimism [ . . ] almost doubles after eu vote see , already we 're getting our britishness back . 
  why does cameron get lumped in with johnson and farage as ` brexiter rats ' when he campaigned to remain in the eu ? 
  really the only rat of those three is johnson . 
  he was the only one who had a chance of being in power post brexit , and he still campaigned for it , then bailed when he thought he could n't win the leadership election . . 
  nigel achieved his aim to win an in-out referendum on eu . 
  not sure where he was meant to go from there . 
  he 's not even an mp . . 
  it 's not legally binding . 
  any government in the future can remove that law . 
  the problem is that if they do , the tories will be able to shout ` irresponsible ! ', 
  at them over and over from the dispatch box . 
  clever bit of political manoeuvring , but utterly pointless legally . 
   `` a rate cut looks inevitable '' from the boe either this month or next remortgage next month . 
  wheeeyyyyyy . 
  talk about lucky timing . 
  going to fix for as long as possible . 
   without an agreement with the eu you 'd be breaking international law why is the eu the gatekeeper ? 
  why not an agreement with the usa , or china , or india ? 
  why does our refugee policy need the okay of the eu ? 
  a current government ca n't bind a future government . 
  it 's one of the best parts of our political system . . 
  they even say as much here :  the junior home office minister james brokenshire said the government could only reassure eu nationals they could remain in britain for now , and that their status in coming years was a matter for a new prime minister . 
  we really should n't be criticising the government who ca n't promise do anything that happens more than 3 months from now . . 
  no need to revoke them , just amend them . 
  it 's dumb to keep laws the same when people decide to abuse them . 
  it helps no one . 
   on 31 december 2009 , eurostar ( u.k. ) ltd changed its name to eurostar international ltd and on 1 september 2010 , we completed the legal transformation to become one unified business owned by three shareholders : ** sncf ( 55 % ) ** , sncb ( 5 % ) and lcr ( 40 % ) . 
  lcr 's holding was transferred to the treasury in june 2014 . 
  so , lets look up what sncf is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sncf  sncf ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale des chemins de fer fran\u00e7ais ; `` national society of french railways '' or `` french national railway company '' ) is ** france 's national state-owned railway company ** and manages the rail traffic in france and the principality of monaco . . 
  british law is ever changing , and anything is able to be revoked or altered . 
  ha , i forgot that we do n't actually have any skin in the game any more . 
  well , other than it being a cool and quick way to get to france . 
  presumably france will still maintain its coast guard . . not like that 's just for our benefit . 
   [ in 2014 , britain committed # 12m over three years to tackle the problems at calais , and part of this is being used to build a 15ft fence along the motorway leading to the port . 
  as well as the three-year calais investment , the uk announced # 2m extra for detection technology such as the heartbeat and carbon dioxide detectors , and # 1m for more dog searches . 
  in august 2015 , the uk and france a fresh agreement on new measures in calais , including a `` control and command centre '' and the deployment of 500 extra british and french police . 
  the uk agreed to pay # 7m over two years towards the new measures , in addition to money previously pledged . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33267137 ) does n't * feel * like we 're dragging our feet . 
  no , the vast majority of trade deals do n't require freedom of movement . 
  as far as i know , the eu is unique in its desire to shoehorn freedom of movement into one . 
  look at tpp , for example . 
  12 country trade union , no freedom of movement . 
  build a wall . 
  ten feet higher !, 
  that can happen now , anywhere on the french coastline . 
  pound shop thatcher . 
  to pull off this heist they have to create some rather protectionist regulations . 
  protectionism is n't much liked by investors . 
  it 's unpredictable and arbitrary . 
  they do n't like being told where to put their money . 
  lets see if the eu decides to pull the trigger on itself over this issue . 
   before he started he asked did anyone in the room believe that there was n't a negative reaction to brexit . 
  that was approximately 30 minutes into his speech , during the q&a section . 
  was n't even the first question . 
  i take you merely watched the 30 second clip from the tweet that was going around the other day , which was in response to a question from a reporter asking him if he was going to resign . 
  essentially he said no , he wo n't resign because he was spot on with his predictions . 
  if you watched the entire thing you 'd have seen he was extremely professional and was n't talking down to anyone . 
  he actually started the speech with a glowing review of britain . 
  why would you not get your house in order before inviting more people to live there ? 
  i do n't generally call people i 'm employing ` strangers ' . . we appointed a canadian as the governor of the bank of england and he 's been amazing . 
  he 's not tried to ruin our economy for the benefit of canada . . 
  it 's quite funny to watch remainers be suspicious of foreigners now . 
  haha . 
  if we can limit eu immigration , we can remove that stupid requirement . 
  the only reason it exists is because the british public wanted reduced immigration so we had to go hard on non-eu immigration , as its the only immigration we control .
