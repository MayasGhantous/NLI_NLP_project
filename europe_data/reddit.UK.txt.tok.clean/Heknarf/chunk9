  what rocks has he been living under ? 
  not much . 
  you 'd need a bomb much bigger to do anything much to a nuclear power plant . 
  they 're also built like fort knox in general . 
  well her and her party will be out of power given enough time anyway . 
  i mean , i ca n't see this new set of imported north african and middle eastern immigrants voting for the ** christian ** democratic union . 
  sweet , tell me what you think . 
  okay , hypocrite it is . 
  noted . 
  anyway , there 's a decent documentary on netflix called ` being ginger ' . 
  it follows a ginger american around scotland as he attempts to get a date . 
  he interviews a bunch of people about their opinion of red heads . 
  [ you 'd be surprised how completely flagrant the prejudice against red hair in the uk is . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7fxlmlnrh4 ) that 's a 2.5 minute clip from the documentary . 
  while watching that clip , in your mind , change the word ` ginger ' to ` muslim ' or ` black ' and what do you get ? 
  that 's a rather extreme case , admittedly . 
  but similar opinions are found in other interviews he does . 
  [ there 's also the new statesman article . 
  ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/nelson-jones/2013/01/should-ginger-bashing-be-considered-hate-crime ), 
   i am a caucasian american . 
  so you do n't even live in the uk with ginger hair ? 
  how can you discount a narrative just because you have n't personally lived it ? 
  you 're in a bit of a pickle here , lad . 
  you 've just admitted that you yourself hold a dismissive opinion about the issues faced by a minority group , without being a member of that minority group . 
  so either you 're a hypocrite , or i 'm fine to make my argument without being a muslim . 
  which is it ? 
  you 're the one that made it about me , mate . 
  you decided to go for the ad hominem , saying i 'm white therefore i ca n't have an opinion and have never experience prejudice . 
  do n't cry when i start talking about myself . 
  may i ask what your race and nationality is , please ? 
  haha , the irony of accusing me of dismissing prejudice against one minority while at the same time dismissing prejudice against a minority . 
  you are an absolute riot . 
   trivial and similar to yours . 
  yes , trivial . 
  i mean [ it 's not like there 's literally a day of the year dedicated to kicking us . . ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/pupils-start-kick-ginger-day-6904298 ) . 
  is there a ` kick a muslim ' day i 'm not aware of ? 
  also , maybe you 'd [ like to tell the parents of this kid ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/443002/popular-teenager-killed-himself-after-being-bullied-about-his-ginger-hair-inquest-hears ) that ginger prejudice is trivial . 
  at least it 's not like gingers have abuse scrawled on walls about them . 
  [ no , wait . 
  yes they do . 
  ] ( https://www.rt.com/uk/313699-police-ginger-hate-crime/ ) we 're getting way off topic now . 
  but you started it . . 
  the idea that minorities beyond reproach is ridiculous . 
  also , fyi my muslim mate laughed when i said i regularly get shouted at by passing cars . 
  says he 's never got that level of random abuse . 
  i 'm a ginger haired person in britain . 
  people literally shout at me from car windows if i 'm walking alone . 
  drunk people try to fight me for it , and school was n't exactly a walk in the park . 
  just because i do n't have brown skin does n't mean i 've not experienced prejudice . 
  what a difference 3 years makes . . [ gchq surveillance : germany blasts uk over mass monitoring ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/25/germany-uk-gchq-internet-surveillance ) foresight and always being prepared for the worst does n't seem to be the germans forte . 
  edit : haha , downvotes without comment . 
  says it all . 
  i am white british . 
  to save you some time , [ i watched this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dijnybk0mw ) and took his argument on board . 
  the article is by the spectator and written by a british journalist . 
  he references the ` tell mama ' bullshit that happened here in the uk after the paris attacks . 
   the point is that by scoffing at the idea that muslims living in europe could be victims , you 're removing any pretense of treating them as human beings , thereby adding to the conflict rather working to solve it . 
  no i 'm not . 
  yes . 
  i am scoffing at the idea that muslims living in britain are victims of a terrorist attack that happened in brussels . 
  because it 's absurd . 
   why ca n't we start treating muslims as human beings ? 
  wait , we 're not ? 
  since when ? 
   victims of all terrorist attacks we 're not talking about all terrorist attacks , and we 're not talking about muslims living in the middle east either . 
  yes , most victims of islamic terrorism are muslims . 
  that 's because there 's a bunch of variations on the theme , and some think it 's fine to kill others . 
  it 's muslims killing muslims in the middle east . 
  over in belgium and paris it 's muslims killing everyone else . 
  western muslims are n't the ones being specifically targeted , are they ? 
  could go visit stone henge on the way , though . 
  make a day of it . 
  fyi :  refusing citizenship/residency ( which equates to kicking them out ) is a right that they do have though . 
  that 's not what people are trying to promote . 
  people keep saying we should remove peoples * citizenship * and make them stateless . 
  are anonymous recognised as a terrorist organization ? 
  this is what i do n't understand about the ` cancel their citizenship and kick them out ! ', 
  line of reasoning so many on here prescribe to . 
  fuck that !, 
  they 're fucking isis fighters . 
  put them on trail and imprison them for life so they ca n't do any more harm to anyone . 
   what are current politicians , who merely inherited the situation , supposed to do exactly ? 
  how about :  ` sorry , no more refugees from muslim countries . 
  we 're finding it difficult to integrate them . 
  we will start accepting refugees from muslim countries again when we 've fully integrated the ones we already have . ', 
  facts are pointless here . 
  everyone 's thrown themselves into a hysterical hissy fit . 
  [ look how well my comment was received . . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bj3u2/a_terrorist_attack_has_happened_in_europe_let_the/d19nmix ), 
  how do you figure ? 
   when his parents realised they could not dissuade him from travelling , they told the police `` anti-radicalisation cell '' in molenbeek , believing the authorities would stop their son leaving . 
  for fuck sake . 
  she did the right thing , and the authorities did nothing . 
  unreal banter . . 
  weekend / r/unitedkindom is insufferable . 
  it 's generally not so bad though . 
  one of the more sensible subreddits on this site , i find . 
  ** day 16 ** the rotting corpses of the oppressors have been cut free and left to fall into the thames . 
  theresa mays body sunk instead of floating , which surprised everyone and lost me # 10 . 
  our new leaders have finally decided on the name for their party . 
  they 've gone with the democratic peoples republic of country mccountryface .
