  so i 'm voting out . 
  sweden sucking off a black man . . 
  the memes write themselves . 
  bit peeved he described the eu purely as an economic union to his audience . . that 's a gross misrepresentation . 
  literally could n't give a shit about being more or less relevant , tbh . 
  he looked like he had tears in his eyes . 
  apparently a minor roasting is normal at these debates , but fuck that shit . 
  do n't bring up the chin !, 
  was the first thing i noticed to be fair , though . 
   the uk seems to be opposed to any and all measures . 
  what are you basing this on ? 
  the best speaker we have on the leave side . 
  shame he said some dodgy bollocks about the nhs on american tv so now everyone can ad hominem him easily in any debate . 
  ** edit : ** needs to fire his tailor . 
  ** edit2 : ** what is the girl at the desk writing , and how can i marry her ? 
  ** edit3 : ** god damn ... [ she 's stone cold . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/fwiz6npks5s?t=132 ) straight up calls a guy out for having no chin . 
  do people genuinely think we 're the only country in the way when it comes to further integration ? 
  quite want us to leave just to see who you guys latch onto next as the scapegoat . 
  the truth is that there is a * huge * amount of euroskeptism in the eu . 
  around 1/3rd of all mep 's are from officially euroskeptic parties . 
  if you think it ends with us , you 're mistaken . 
  i 'm voting out , but i 'd still quite like england to be broken up into smaller states . . 
  he 's got you there , tbh . 
  obnoxiously likable . 
  humiliation and embarrassment is kind of our thing . . 
  just look at the polls . 
  you wo n't get a representivie sample on here . 
  welsh are basically same as the english , with almost perfect 50/50 . 
  scotland and ni are much more pro eu , both favouring remain heavily . 
  she 's banging to be fair . 
  still strikes me as a * bit * aggressive , though . 
  circling a woman and singing at them en mass ... no one else ? 
  obviously it 's all with best intentions , but i think lots of people would find it very embarrassing . 
   a uk outside of the eu is significantly less useful to the united states . 
  less useful , maybe . 
  but still very useful . 
  one of the guys that killed lee rigby was a paranoid schizophrenic , for example . 
   now it turns out that a major slice of the leave camp what , one guy ? 
  ** uk ** * bob geldof got wet after spotting some seamen in the thames * the polls for the referendum shifted , but the boredom did n't . 
  * mp got shanked by racist nutter , everyone from all sides of the debate tried to score referendum points . 
  * tim peake came back down to earth to vote in the referendum probably . 
  asked what the hell we 'd done with the place since he 's been gone . 
  * our football fans have been disgracing us all week , much to the delight of every newspaper . 
  i fully expected tear gas regardless . . 
  regulating elections is very different to regulating what people can and ca n't say . 
  if i want to say immigrants are ruining our country , i should be able to . 
  not really . 
  you 're underestimating how bad 2008 was . 
  also , stop moving the goal posts . 
  you 're talking utter shit , frankly . 
  nato is n't going to disband because of a bit of economic trouble , as demonstrated many times over the past 60 years odd . 
   every country in europe would go into economic recession this already happened in 2008 . 
  the only eu country that avoided recession was poland . . last i checked , nato still exists . 
  nothing . 
  it predates the eu by decades , and is something eu members join or do n't join on their own accord . 
  it has nothing to do with the eu . 
  i do n't think putin fears the eu . 
  he fears nato . 
  like i said , stifle political discourse . 
  i 'm not okay with that . 
  if that invokes usa comparisons , so be it . 
  banning various forms of speech is clearly way way way worse than the usa refusing to ban guns , because somewhere someone has to decide which speech is banned . 
  not sure about changing their minds , but plenty of posts in my facebook feed saying do n't vote leave because that 's what jo cox 's murderer wants . 
   people like farage are to blame too . 
  oh come on . 
  the thing is ... 
  so what ? 
  there 's no plausible solution other than ` stifle political discourse ' , so what is there to even discuss ? 
  it was tragic , but ultimately unavoidable . 
  i feel like making one of those / r/the _ donald button pushing images for this sub . 
  one one side would be ' a single muslim does n't represent islam ' and on the other side would be ' a single leave voter does represent the entirety of leavers ' . . 
  which bit specifically do you think is me exaggerating britain 's level of power ? 
   there were two clear pledges made by all three westminster leaders at the referendum . 
  a ) the best way to protect scotland 's eu membership is by staying part of the uk and b ) that scotland would get ` devo-max ' or the maximum amount of devolution of powers to scotland . 
  this is utter bollocks . 
  they were talking points , and that 's it . 
  and devo-max was never on the cards . . that was repeatedly made clear . 
  ` the vow ' was not about devo-max . 
  that 's no different to just using the pound unilaterally , and comes with all the same problems . 
  explain yourself . 
  how do people cook at work , though ? 
  or are canteens the norm ? 
   and when they make lunch around noon interesting . 
  so in germany it 's normal to cook a lunch ? 
  over here we generally have cold food like sandwiches , fruit , etc. 
  only hot meal will generally be dinner . 
   no one cares . 
  you are wrong . 
  the scottish people care a lot about currency , and it was a very big issue during the 2014 referendum . 
  the snp had no real answer for what currency an independent scotland would use . 
  they said that the ruk would enter into a currency union with scotland , and they 'd be able to keep the pound . 
  everyone in any position of power said that was absolutely off the table , and the bank of england said a currency union would not happen . 
  so the options were : * euro ( very much disliked by all brits , including scots ) * unilateral use of gbp ( no control over monetary policy ... 
  going independent with your hands tied behind you back , basically ) * new currency ( george soros 's wet dream , economically very risky . ), 
  they were all shit options , and the scottish people realised that . 
  the euro was the least shit option . 
  i never said scotland could n't join the eu . 
  i said they 'd never be allowed to be the continuing state like some seem to believe . 
  they 'd have to join on equal terms ( no opt-outs ) , same as everyone else .
