stagnation caused by no competition , such as what is happening in the eurozone currently , if countries such as spain , green and france could quantitive ease their way out of recession , they would not have to suffer from austerity . 
  copyright rules can be a way to separate yourself from competition and remain attractive to companies . 
  if you are trying to compare the us to the eu then i am afraid that there is far more difference between the richer areas and poorer areas here than there is in the us . 
  there are also different laws & tax systems in us states although i 'm not familiar with them . 
  it is just something which does not need to be harmonised . 
  i fail to see the benefits . 
  i have never come across `` this content is not available in your country '' but i know lots of people in germany who do on most videos . 
  surely copyright laws are something which should be up to a member state to decide , not the eu ? 
  harmonising it will stop competition and create stagnation , but if that is the tactic some countries are using to further their economy , by all means it will tackle `` the problem '', 
   maybe you want to make no payments to the eu , get double representation in the european parliament and only participe in european programs you like ? 
  if that 's what you 're offering then yes sure we 'll take it . 
  also we want fish and chip vans across the eu to ensure we get suitable food , not that native stuff you keep trying to sell to us .

  free markets are great up to a certain point . 
  that point arrives when a company is large enough to create its own closed market .

  england and wales are one criminal jurisdiction , scotland has its own as does northern ireland . 
  the only other way they could 've split it down is in police force areas but i doubt they 're organised enough to have statistics on that level since they usually overlap .

  our empire was better than your `` empire '' .

  northern ireland is a wonderful place to live as long as you do n't try to dig up the past . 
  the vast majority of people could n't give a rat 's arse about religion , britain , ireland or even the old firm , they would just like to live their lives to the fullest , sorry if this seems a mess to you . 
  i do n't agree with any country using subsidies to make themselves more competitive - it kills off the chance of innovation in new farming techniques , technologies and most importantly crop development that does n't include gm/buying stuff in from the us . 
  i would be more than happy if uk farms went bankrupt because of cheap spanish produce ; if spain can produce items cheaper they should be able to control the market . 
  farming , in my opinion , should be about progression and not about farming the same crop year in year out . 
  larger farms mean that farmers can get better prices for produce , as they have more to sell they can demand higher prices . 
  they can also get better prices for seed , fuel and equipment because of the bulk they buy . 
  i personally do n't agree with having too large farms , but also would prefer to see arable farms of 150-250 acres which can provide work for a `` farmily '' and several workers . 
  if cap ended i would expect france to subsidise their farmers due to the amount of poverty/stuff being dumped in paris . 
  cap is a lifeline for many small farms but on the other hand , a very large farm near me brings in over # 50,000 a year in subsidies which is a pittance for them as they have a ridiculous amount of turnover . 
  it would be better to provide grants for farmers to diversify , gain support and get loans at cost to provide them capital to buy more productive animals and more economical equipment . 
  it 's similar to giving a man a fish and he can eat , teach him how to fish and he can provide food for his whole family ( and hopefully export to countries outside of the eu ) . 
  the cap is seen as a waste by many people in the uk , especially those who work in agriculture . 
  it is basically free money for them , but also subsidises uncompetitive farming practices ( mainly stereotyped as french farms , sorry ) . 
  [ here 's a telegraph article that explains the issue . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1434217/a-bloated-beast-that-spawned-beef-mountains-and-wine-lakes.html ) in the uk we have some of the largest farms in western europe , which means we can compete on a large scale to reduce costs , whereas traditionally french farms are small , maybe 10 acres or so which means they ca n't produce the same amount of food at the same cost . 
  all commercial british farmers would not mind seeing the end of cap payments as it would actually give them more market share in the eu - it would also allow african farmers to compete , but that is a different story . 
  what british farmers would be against is the end of free movement of people as many brits see agricultural work that of someone below them . 
  mainly eastern europeans come across here to pick berries/eating apples and the majority of brassicas - most of them have degrees and are very intelligent but it is the only work they can get - it also pays well , for someone who picks quickly , and well they can earn # 100 + a day . 
  bulgarians come from a country called `` bulgaria and romania '' , there are 29 million of them waiting to move to the uk and take our jobs . 
  but really bulgarians are alright , they 're good at picking strawberries and their caravans usually have the largest flags . 
  have n't come across bulgarians in any other way as i live in a farming county in england . 
  england did vote tory and we got a coalition . 
  we 're stealing their jobs before they steal ours . 
  maybe a few people in the uk would be happier in the eea , some would prefer the uk to be in the middle of the atlantic but the vast majority would prefer to be in the eu . 
  after reading the article the only thing david cameron is trying to do is delay the dpr until after 2015 , the year of the uk elections . 
  only 65 % of the uk voted , and 36 % of them voted tory . 
  the uk does have a [ constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_the_united_kingdom ) , just we choose to keep it unwritten so it saves money on paper . 
  iirc this is her way of blaming landlords , and or businesses , for allowing illegal immigrants to legally rent a property or do anything in the uk . 
  overall pretty stupid as it 's her job to ensure her colleagues , the police force , have got the correct equipment and intelligence to track illegal immigrants down and either let them claim asylum or get deported . 
  but when you cut down the police force you have to find other people to blame , in this case it is business owners and landlords . 
  uk - i like the queen , it 's nice to have someone impartial that represents the country . 
  if shit hits the fan she can effectively close down parliament and have absolute power if she wanted . . but without good reason we 'd be a republic over night . 
  it 's strange to think she was there when we were winding up the empire . 
  the cost of her is pretty negligible considering she represents our country , allows the crown property to be used by government . 
  also prince phillip is amazing with some of the things he comes out with . 
  i despise that we have to pay for her offspring who will not be kings queens , such as the one with the stupid hat when wills and kate got married . 
  i really dislike charles who seems to stick his nose into planning laws and lobbies mps constantly , and well camilla should never really have happened . 
  i do n't really like william either , although thats unfair to say considering he 's not really done anything so far . 
  i would like prince harry as king as he seems to contribute to worthwhile charities in the uk , commonwealth & us and is a bit more ` real ' . 
  part of me thinks the current queen should be the last , but the links to royalty , and links to other anglicised countries , would be forever lost and we 'd end up with a president , which i do n't really like the idea of and they would probably be oliver cromwell v2 .0 . 
  at least with charles you would know where you stand . 
  the royals are also head of the anglican faith which is pretty important to a lot of people . 
  sort of , through [ quantitive easing . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantitative_easing ) the us is prohibited from directly printing money to pay off debt . 
  the quantitive easing allows central banks to create money to stimulate the economy . 
  basically by increasing the amount of money there is , it makes it worth less . 
  this then means the stuff that country exports becomes cheaper to countries which use other currencies . 
  the flip-side is that imports become more expensive .
