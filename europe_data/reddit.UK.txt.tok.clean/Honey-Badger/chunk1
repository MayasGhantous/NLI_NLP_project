pretty sure there is enough to represent all deaths from the commonwealth so there will be a lot more than 850k, 
  not enjoying a hostile country flying nuclear bombers above oyur country is not a circle jerk, 
  lots of cathedrals and such here so im gon na go contemporary . 
  in the uk , [ the sis ( mi5/6 ) building ] ( http://d1hw6n3yxknhky.cloudfront.net/025333601_prevstill.jpeg ) basically because it is exactly what i picture the base of an intelligence service to look like . 
  abroad i would say [ the guggenheim in bilbao ] ( http://img.groundspeak.com/waymarking/log/d17c0eb4-db48-40b9-a3bd-dd06c26c75c2.jpg ) for its sheer creativity, 
  well lets be honest , he wrote down the word ebola and threw what he wrote on in the bin . 
  yeah mate , as im coming bristol itd cost me about # 7 in fuel to go all around it so im stuck with it . 
  today i had to pay # 7 to get into wales . 
  they should be paying me ... ... well i suppose it was for work so they kinda are . 
  pretty much all good trip hop is . 
  tricky is also from here if you know who he is, 
  you quite clearly made your origional comment to refute the comment from pres klaus saying he wished us sports fans got as hyped up as european fans, 
  english . 
  heres some stuff from the city i 'm from , bristol .

  might as well put the version from [ cafe del mar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzlubudevpc ), 
  an american refusing to believe that the us isnt the best in the world at something ? 
  well i never . 
  [ bring it the fuck on ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/12/article-0-0a69feda000005dc-668_634x406.jpg ), 
  britain have a better track record than most ... `` britain became the first country among the group of 7 industrialized nations to meet the target last year , helped by a $ 3.95 billion boost to its aid budget '' basically , the best track record . 
  well considering france and germany will be receiving the biggest pay out and the uk will be putting the most in . 
  you kinda will . 
  do you have any proof whatsoever ? 
   and i remember hague as a boring , humorless guy who did n't even have enough charisma to hold the tories in line . 
  what . 
  all of my what . 
  hague is by far the best politician at pmqs , ever . 
  his wit is razor sharp . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opy16szdegk - an example from a situation much more nerve-wracking than pmqs, 
  i believe that story actually involves churchill dropping a towel, 
  god thats a shit title . 
  i dont know why i added ` as a whole ', 
  well whats romania doing ? 
  what has romania ever done to help others ? 
  northern [ england ] ( http://www.northnews.co.uk/res/uploads/pictures/oct2012/211012/autumnal_lake_district_17.jpg ) [ and this is what its like around the corner from my house in the south west ] ( http://www.bristolphotoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ag_late_autumn_02.jpg ), 
  germans are such lovely people , always happy to talk to and generally really easy to get along with . 
  im going to be in berlin next week and cant wait to see all your lovely faces . 
  france is beautiful , i find the people have the same sense of dry humour as us and always good to get drunk with ( as are all europeans really ) . 
  dutch , seriously if i wasnt an englishman i would want to be dutch , i honestly cant think of a bad thing to say about you guys and i thinks its safe to say everyone else in europe would agree that the dutch are always welcome wherever they go . 
  we 're talking about a single year of difference here . 
  the light red areas are still 79.4-80 .4 life expectancy , there is nothing wrong with that . 
  in scotland they deep fry pizza, 
   pieces of northern england you mean scotland . 
  its also not necessarily only their diets ( although i am told in scotland you can buy deep fried pizza ) but also heavy alcohol and drug abuse, 
   you seem to assume that we would be sad . 
  you personally may not be but everyone agrees it will harm the eu . 
  i also assumed nothing , if you 're going to speak our language then learn to do it better, 
  you 're missing the point . 
  france breaks the deficit rules , nothing happens and everything goes on . 
  greece cooks its book , we all ( especially germany ) bails them the fuck out , no one gets in trouble everything goes on . 
  if the uk refuse to pay this ridiculous sum then if we look at the past im guessing nothing will happen . 
  if the eu imposes fines then the referendum will suddenly be pushed a shit load more forward so the uk can rush its way out of a toxic relationship, 
   then again it also means that the uk has been performing better than previously thought . 
  this is where the anti eu argument comes from . 
  in the uk huge cuts are being made and people are struggling but its doing well for our economy and its basically time to just hold tight and get ourselves back on our feet . 
  the uk is being rewarded by its success by having to give money to other countries who dont know how to run their own economies . 
  how about the countries who dont perform get punished and those who do perform get rewarded . 
  anyone who thinks that isnt a ridiculously large number of people coming into a tiny island is an idiot . 
   it was a totally different organisation it was different . 
  it was in no way ` totally different ', 
  i think there is maybe like a 60/70 % chance things would fuck up . 
  then again i also think things will also get worse if the uk stays in . 
  best case scenario reforms happen and the city is allowed to continue pumping money , worst case the eu moves financial trade away from london to help other economies . 
  [ i think this article raises some decent points ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10793681/without-reform-it-would-be-best-for-britain-to-leave-eu.html ), 
  at the end of the day he does make a fair point , i dont fully agree with it but its a decent point none the less, 
  mother fucker that video is an hour long . 
  what sort of attention span do you think you 're dealing with here . 
  i support the idea of the eu but i dont really think it works particularly well nor do i think it has the uk best interests at heart therefore i still believe there should be a referendum . 
  there is currently a thread at the top of this sub saying how true it is about the uk threatening to leave as illustrated in a comical cartoon . 
   oh then nobody would come , thats the idea, 
  aye but the only way immigration laws would change is if the uk leaves the eu . 
  so im talking about a hypothetical situation where to work in the uk , eu citizens would need to apply for citizenship in the uk . 
  a system where you give citizenship to people based on their merits rather than their nationality would surely benefit said society more , no ? 
  surely a points based system would be more beneficial ? 
   and that allows many skillful people to immigrate to uk . 
  but it also allows those with no skills whatsoever in favour of people who have skills but are not from europe . 
  the current laws would rather have a french criminal than a indian engineer . 
  but technically looking at the amount of people in the eu who speak english there is an argument to say french is inferior . 
  in the english definition * none of the buildings in ops link are castles . 
  * a large building , typically of the medieval period , fortified against attack with thick walls , battlements , towers , and often a moat . 
  [ this is a castle ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/bodiam-castle-10my8-1197.jpg ), 
  you call those castles ? 
  all those `` castles '' must be in need of desperate repair . 
   million dollar question dont you mean million euro or even million pound question ? 
  and everyone i know is fine . 
  i dont know anybody who is struggling , this in including all my mates who live in london . 
  then again i 'm sure if i lived in different areas i would know people are struggling , anecdotal evidence means nothing . 
  i never said forbidding languages . 
  why are you jumping to conclusions ? 
  i just said one language . 
  a primary language . 
  a default language . 
  maybe you dont have this problem very much where you 're from but its quite prevalent in certain areas of the uk . 
  there are communities here that refuse to integrate with the rest of the country , they 're happy to live here and reap the benefits but refuse to learn the langue and adapt to the culture , they create their own little worlds inside areas of cities and wont adapt at all . 
  its party because of the language barrier ( but mainly because of a religious barrier which i should have listed in my utopian europe , one that is secular ) , if you cant communicate with someone you are separate from them , separation causes divides , divides cause mistrust , mistrust causes hatred . 
  ironically i think we 're hitting a language barrier here or something ? 
  i said divides . 
  languages create divides . 
  what ? 
  either split up more or do the opposite and come together more .
