  wine is actually the most popular alcoholic drink in the uk http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/shopping-and-consumer-news/11381369/wine-overtakes-beer-as-nations-favourite-drink.html, 
  but they 're kinda wrong and pretty confusing to be fair, 
  i dont think we have a word for ` lieblings ' in english . 
  theres a doc on netflix at the mo called fed up and its about these fat kids and how much they exercise and what they eat and their parents think like like bowls of `` low fat '' cheerios or whatever will make them loose weight . 
  they generally think a product labeled as low fat will make them loose fat . 
  lib dem , i live in a university town and they were a libdem safe seat but now the nus is very anti them so i dont think they will get it , fingers crossed though, 
  to be fair if they actually campaigned properly in bristol they would have probably gotten a seat here , so much focus was on brighton that they just seemed to have forgotten that they have a pretty big following in bristol, 
  im voting libdem and i dont care that they failed with tuition fees , free university is a bad idea imo . 
  i blame it on lack of education , so many people just dont realise that carbs are fattening . 
  a lot of fat people hate is generic bullying but the majority is taking apart the health at any size argument, 
  yeah living in a southern wealthy city ( bristol ) i cant imagine being fat or knowing fat people . 
  for me being fat is something of a class thing , its always been seen as something the working class are . 
  i work in a very middle class environment ( television ) and i never see any fat people . 
  eu human rights laws dont allow that, 
  are we not meant to trust anything coming out of russia ? 
  you 're right , but it would be pretty fucking odd to want to start a war with the eu and still like europeans, 
  [ 2 months ago it was 86 % ] ( http://time.com/3724564/putin-approval-rating/ ), 
  that doesnt really address my point that the russian people dont really like europeans after you said they do and that its just their leaders . 
  also [ bush 's approval rating was 60 % in 2004 ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/116500/presidential-approval-ratings-george-bush.aspx ), 
  putin has like an 80 % + approval rate . 
  this is a different leak . 
  did you read the article ? 
  none of this article is to do with spying on citizens , did you read the article ? 
  wait what ? 
  gchq obviously spies on everyone , there are loads of leaks we all know about . 
  im talking about this case , its another example of american spy agencies using european spy agencies to give up other european firms so the us can sue them for doing trade with countries the us doesnt like . 
  id like to start seeing european spy agencies spying on us firms so they can be sued for breaking laws as well . 
  its not the 5 eyes , its just the us . 
  the cia also spies on british banks to try and find ways to sue them for trading with countries the us doesnt like, 
  but pedants none the less, 
  uk/overseas territory same fucking diff . 
  owned by the british people . 
  i fear that putin may give them some shoddy boats or planes or whatever which will only result in young naive argentine lives being lost as they get over zealous . 
  urr hate to be a dick about this as the message is lols but the first image is a digital render . 
  may i suggest something like [ this ] ( https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5809/leu-unclass-20120912-0850-181.jpg ) or perhaps a bit more subtle with the [ silent world destroyer next to the most advanced ship in the seven seas ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/nuclear_submarine_hms_vanguard_passes_hms_dragon_as_she_returns_to_hmnb_clyde,_scotland_mod_45152118.jpg ), 
  yes they did . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 how do you not know how to use google ? 
  are people aware that most people in northern/western europe are atheist and that almost all agree with gay marriage and that it is legal in lots of the western european countries ? 
   i 've met as of yet ( along with the scottish cant tell if sarcasm or hasnt been to glasgow ... 
  not completely , but mostly . 
  you 're children probably should do it completely - that doesnt mean they cant also learn things from your culture, 
  what makes you think sharing the currency will make us at the heart of europe ? 
  there are plenty of countries using euros that were very much on the outside . 
   of course you would n't well , yeah i would actually . 
  they 're not studying to learn the language , they grew up speaking it . 
  the whole point of exam results in reality is proving how hard you can work to learn a curriculum . 
  `` but in actual fact , the numbers who actually choose the subject at a-level and sit the exam are very low , '' well then it should be dropped, 
  ive gone on a youtube adventure and realised almost no hotels make a good video . 
  even [ the ritz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rwg49n2lpm ) looks shit . 
  dat blue neon . 
  its like one the most upsetting songs , why would they choose this !?!!?!? 
  whats stopping you from taking one ? 
  sure does , many i have met will also take a year out after national service as a sort of gap year, 
  i really like his haircut, 
  treason, 
  even as an englishman i think its almost offensive to call them french . 
  they 're only french on paper , not culturally . 
  i mean they dont even use guillotines , savages . 
  i think im right in saying the majority of countries who celebrate an independence day are celebrating the end of british rule so in theory we are most independence freedom having people are we have dispensed the most independence in history . 
  they do invest . 
  you are forced to learn a language in school , it is one of your gcse 's , it carries the same weight as maths / english / science or whatever in regards to exam results . 
  the problem is the average student in germany for instance is going to hear and see a lot of english growing up from film/tv/music or whatever , walk down a street in berlin and you will see english words in shop windows and on signs , the english language is inescapable . 
  whilst say in the uk i the only experience i ever had of hearing or seeing german was from watching films about the second world war . 
  this is obviously going to lead to students in germany speaking english way better than students in england speak german . 
  it also means that when traveling i find germans would much rather speak english to me than to have a conversation with me in my broken german , it didnt take long for me to loose all motivation to really learn it . 
  cant wait till the internet reaches ireland , im sure they have lots more funny stories to tell us . 
  no but taking the piss is fun, 
  thats not completely mental . . 
  i mean wayne rooney plays football and makes more than all those people in a week . 
  you apparently dont know how businesses work . 
  literally seems to be all we talk about here, 
  ive been to thailand , i even have a bunch of thai cousins and other relatives . 
  the food is no different in the uk . 
  also i find curry way hotter in the uk that i do in india , my mother is from india so i 've spent a decent amount of time there . 
   small vietnamese and thai places they are quite literally everywhere, 
  i dont actually think he/she lives abroad and is just trying to make a point, 
  i think it can be good in some situations but it some situations its pretty bad . 
  i didnt realise 25-50 meant mass , the uk went up 400 thousand last year alone , so i dunno what we would call that . 
  i think in the uk its gone a little too far , well especially in london . 
  the large majority of immigrants here only want to live in london and the city has now just become ridiculous , house prices are just insane there and also the culture of the place has changed so rapidly in the last 20 years its almost unrecognisable . 
  britons are now a minority in their capital city which , i dunno , personally i thinks its excessive . 
  i do think immigration from muslim countries has got to stop , this will make me sound like a white supremacist but they have quite literally bread themselves into a majority in many areas of the uk and they refuse to become a part of british society . 
  why did you cross out british and write english ? 
  since when is hitting a jewish person suddenly antisemetic ? 
  hit him * for * being jewish is but just being a chav and attacking random people doesnt make you antisemetic, 
  thats not my point . 
  just look at them and listen to what theyre saying clearly a bunch of chavs, 
  from the videos it looks to me like drunk dicks being drunk dicks and not an anti semitic attack . 
  when im in asia i suppose i feel kinda european as europeans tend to stick together in far flung countries, 
  no you say the country that you are from . 
  does jp morgan count as a tech firm ? 
  its a financial company . 
  im sorry , im still waiting for the source citing glasgow as having the most it jobs outside of london, 
  well according to this ; http://www.theguardian.com/cities/datablog/2015/jan/19/uk-cities-ranked-jobs-migration-house-prices-broadband-speeds-data glasgow is doing very poorly for jobs . 
  according to this ; http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/16/bristol-smart-city-future-technology bristol is `` the uk 's most technologically smart urban environment '' - im guessing that means great for it ? 
  i dont where you read the stat saying glawgow was good for it jobs . 
  i cant find anything about glasgow having any sort of it sector, 
  hows the job going ? 
  if you want to work in it i doubt scotland is a good place to live, 
  that would be fucking awesome !,
