  it 'd benefit your home country best to work in the field you studied in there . 
  yeah i * think * we should stay in but comments like that make me want to leave as a big old fuck you . 
  so why not have it ? 
  again im guessing this down to english being a second language for people . 
  i said striving for perfection . 
  this means trying to reach it , endlessly improve . 
  i said striving for perfection . 
  it means trying to reach it . 
  but its not perfect it is . 
  the argument against that point is that in terms of security for europeans we should be striving for perfection, 
  i doubt other eu countries would want the likes of mi5/6 and gchq spying on their citisens, 
   gb is a industry nation that lifes from producing and shipping things no its not . 
  we hardly make anything . 
  we rely on global finance, 
  pretty sure thats not the case here, 
  the old horseshoe affect, 
   it would devastate the uk rental market to expel 800,000 polish people . 
  cant help but think is might be a good thing . 
  rental prices are ridiculous, 
  not usually one for wishing death upon another but i hope their house burns down . 
  mmmm bacon . 
  but no seriously , thats fucking catastrophic . 
  there has clearly been some major fuck up if an entire factory is able to burn down , i wonder what preventative measures they had if any ? 
  why do the polish like italians so much ? 
  i 'm just surprised as i view them as very different countries . 
  how about we do the opposite ; we dig a trench, 
  its about as secret as us having a monarchy . 
  the question was if women ever asked for it . 
  im saying they * kinda * did . 
  read the link `` many argued that veiling should be restored to stop further dissolution of the iranian identity and culture , [ 52 ] as from an iranian point of view the unveiled women are seen as exploited by western materialism and consumerism . 
  [ 46 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] wearing of headscarf and chador was one of main symbols of the revolution , [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 62 ] [ 64 ] along with the resurgence and wearing of other traditional iranian dresses . 
  '' ... ... `` and even many secular and westernized women , who did not believe in wearing them before the revolution , began wearing them , in solidarity with the vast majority of women who always wore them . 
  [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 52 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] wearing headscarves and chadors was used as a significant populist tool and iranian veiled women played an important rule in the revolution 's victory '', 
  kinda . 
  headscarves were outrightly banned in iran in the 30s when they were viewed as a status symbol , many women fought to be allowed to wear them again https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hijab_by_country#iran, 
  in the modern world we dont consider an unborn fetus human because they arent human . 
  you 're literally living in the 20 's . 
  by not allowing them to abort ... . 
   one of those options free to be discussed as well is adoption , there are millions of people in the world who can not have children if adoptions laws were changed to make adoption an easier process this is something that solves the issue of people having kids they do n't want . 
  that doesnt help the declining birthrate in poland if their unwanted children are being shipped overseas . 
  perhaps looking at post ww2 when there was a massive shortage of manpower in poland the measure the government took then to increase in the birthrate the same as in the uk , and france where many benefits were gained from having kids such as tax breaks and the like . 
  encourage your populous to breed , dont enforce it . 
  also dont dismiss opinions based on emotions when we 're discussing brining people into our world . 
  having a child should be a decision based on emotion . 
  how the fuck do you think unwanted children are going to help the countries low birthrate . 
  parents dont want to be forced to raise mistakes , those kids will have miserable lives, 
  its seems to me that many people here believe that germany was happily taking in so many refugees that it couldnt cope is because germany really wants to show the world how un-nazi they are these days . 
  or / r/unitedkingdom, 
   protestant or anglican branch of the same tree , no ? 
  the uk is not in the us . 
  your freedom of speech laws dont exist here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_speech_by_country#united_kingdom, 
  basically in the uk we have an independent organisation called ofcom who regulate what it shown on tv . 
  news has to be independent , if they have an interview one party member they have to show the interview with his/her opposite number . 
  the newspapers are exempt from this regulation so they just end up going fucking ham . 
  fucking guardian are so embarrassing . 
  fry did , its attenborough im talking about . 
  eh , maybe . 
  i feel like as he hasnt done much in a while he may not be at the top of everyones lists, 
  which doesnt make him an actor, 
  daniel day lewis ; i do have dual citizenship , but i think of england as my country . 
  he coincidentally learnt to act about 3 mins from where i sit now at the bristol old vic theatre school, 
   he learnt his trade and started his career in dublin . 
  according to wikipedia he learnt the trade in belfast at the lyric theatre, 
  growing up in the 90s bombing were a very common thing , actually way more common with the ira , eta . 
  nobody also seems to remember the madrid bombings in 04 or london in 05 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_the_european_union and seeing as for some reason wikipedia doesnt list the ira as a terrorist group https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_terrorist_incidents_in_great_britain https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_bombings_during_the_northern_ireland_troubles_and_peace_process why are peoples memories so short ? 
  i just got back from traveling around central and south america , i have never seen our flag so much before . 
  it is everywhere . 
  like i cant even begin to describe . 
  you will see it at least a dozen times a day , no exaggeration . 
  even in cuba , actually especially in cuba , it is like the most popular fashion statement . 
  i very nearly decided to do a little photo album of people wearing our flag as it was just so common . 
  theres a very prominent music scene thats genre/culture is pretty unique to the city . 
  no idea what youre talking about . 
  bristol is great . 
  maybe if youre a bit older and just want to go see landscapes then yeah its not for you . 
  if youre a young person there is a lot of fun to be had, 
  i think ireland gets more rain on average a year but only little more and yeah is very similar , norway is much colder and gets way more snow, 
  weather here isnt actually that bad , i think you were perhaps unlucky . 
  what ? 
  we dont use dollars . 
  i am shocked by how many europeans think the uk just looks like london . 
  i like to travel and when i meet other europeans they will often say something like `` actually i went to the uk for the first time a few years ago and i had no idea you had pretty cities and villages '' or something to that effect or that we have good looking countryside , its really surprising . 
  i also think of when the tour de france went through england and many french fans were saying they thought the uk was just grubby concrete towns and empty countryside with no views . 
  pics ; [ bristol ] ( https://www.specialistuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bristol-152495731.jpg ) - that is literally 5 mins walk from where i sit now [ bath ] ( http://www.bath.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/riverside-walk-bath.jpg ) [ lake district ] ( http://cdni.condenast.co.uk/1920x1280/k_n/lake-district-conde-nast-traveller-26sept13-alamy_b.jpg ) [ oxford ] ( http://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/styles/ow_large_feature/public/field/field_image_main/aerial_oxford.jpg?itok=jq67g78g ) [ snowdonia ] ( http://www.mountain-images.co.uk/mountain-images-pictures/snowdonia/fullsize/snowdon-spring-reflections-sw_20060322_209.jpg ), 
  if this was in the us we would all be making fun of fat/lazy americans, 
  i love how you have completely edited your comment after i replied . 
  it originally said ; and london is ? ', 
  less of a tax haven as the corporate tax rate is almost 10 % higher . 
  12.5 % in ireland and 20 % in london - although it will drop to 17 % by the end of this year, 
  its becoming something of a corporate tax haven edit ; before you patriotic irish downvote me to oblivion do some research http://www.forbes.com/sites/taxanalysts/2013/11/06/if-ireland-is-not-a-tax-haven-what-is-it/#1d90c99a3355 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement - theres even a fucking wiki page on it . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/business/international/ireland-tax-rate-breaks.html http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/24/corporations-dodging-tax-havens-pfizer-allergan-ireland, 
  the language is confusing because of homophones , as in various words that are the same but mean differenct things ; there , their , they 're / which , witch / night , knight / no , know / to , two , too - [ the list goes on ] ( http://www.singularis.ltd.uk/bifroest/misc/homophones-list.html ) but what i think really makes our language ( british english ) hard to learn is that we say we things that dont make sense as by our own rules in a weird game we play of not actually meaning what we say but expecting you to pick up on certain subtleties to understand what is actually being said . 
  yeah you could say you go regularly , frequently or often which all mean basically the same thing . 
  hmm , must have just been me missing them . 
  also i dont want to be rude but ` im going to ' means you have not been but will go to those places . 
  i believe you meant to say ' i went to ' meaning you had been there . 
  those types . 
  chinese have an increasingly bad reputation but i feel that in the uk we just lump all tourists into one pile . 
  we 're also aware of how the rest of the world views our tourists ( this thread being a prime example ) so we know its hypocritical to complain . 
  where do the french travel ?
