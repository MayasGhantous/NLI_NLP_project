  [ theres actually 3 shakespeare coins ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j4bw5ueh6mi/vo1f3v1syui/aaaaaaaabzo/qnvsmpzygxw/s1600/shakespeare%2bcoins.jpeg ) . 
  never watched it in my life , dont know anyone who does, 
  good point . 
  playing dota has taught that apparently obama is gay, 
  but if you 're talking to someone they 're not going to say you have bad teeth unless you do . 
  they might say ` why do brits have bad teeth ', 
  if i was loosing id probbs pretend not to care, 
   why do you have bad teeth ? 
  mate you have no excuse for having bad teeth . 
  im quite surprised by the comment , i have never heard of spainish engineering being at all good . 
  if anything if i heard someone say ` that looks like its been designed by spainish engineers ' i would think they were saying it 's poorly made . 
  then again northern europeans tend to look down on southern europeans in just about anything . 
  i had no idea . 
  how come ? 
  ` the thick of it ' is our version of the west wing, 
  is it eaiser to illegally get a job in the uk bar the rest of the eu ? 
  or am i misreading what youre saying ? 
  i honestly dont think the eu is what is stopping europe having wars . 
  i think the nukes stop wars happening all over the globe . 
  completely with you . 
  i 've always felt like a giant in spain at 1.82 which actually feels more average in the uk . 
  there is no way the average spanish person is taller than the average brit . 
  i feel like a giant when im in spain, 
  im only taking the piss mate . 
  i 've spent a fair amount of time in india and notice the difference between the two . 
  which is the point im trying to make . 
  in the us and in the uk we pick up on different things , judge people in different ways . 
  sometimes , usually its just when they open their mouths . 
   i mean , race and religion are often the two most defining features of a person . 
  it 's impossible not to acknowledge . 
  im gon na disagree with you there . 
  maybe for you in the us but where im from class is a more defining feature, 
  we dont really ` do ' mayors in the uk . 
  its a pretty new thing for us . 
  the city i 'm from is a little over a thousand years old , we got our first mayor 4 years ago, 
  go anywhere else on this site and all stories about khan have been focused on his religion . 
  just about everyone i know has been to portugal . 
  i highly doubt they were your typical middle class types . 
  if it sees you get more money in return then why not . 
  and pretty much every other city . 
  where i 'm from ( bristol ) was like 75 % remain, 
  exactly . 
  the uk is the bad guy and has been for ages . 
  this government is happy to fight dirty as many previous governments have been for centuries . 
  the eu ca n't claim to be a morally superior institution whilst stooping to the uk 's level . 
  i 've seen plenty of comments here about how much we 're wanted to fail . 
  look i really hate brexit but i hope it works in some way because well i do n't want my life to fucking fall apart . 
  whilst plenty of other europeans here really want to see us suffer i dont really get it . 
  i like being in the eu and all but if say another country was to leave and we were n't i doubt i 'd pay much attention to it , i 'd think it was wrong but their choice and all . 
  unlike some people who really like the idea of us suffering and it just comes down to being vindictive, 
  but we 're not somewhere else , we 're at home, 
   if that happens , eu will bend them over and spank them hard . 
  and then make a proper example out of them . 
  post trade talks that would be impossible . 
  also i doubt the eu would be willing to risk citizens lives out of revenge . 
  french and swiss make beer ? 
  you dont need a fucking spoon to get to our beer , its great . 
  i imagine many far right le pen types in europe will argue so . 
  yes, 
  i swear sweden keeps telling us that they 're leading by example and we should take a leaf out of their book . 
  imo that doesnt look like the best of ideas . 
  i believe quite a few irish also joined british regiments before the irish regiments were formed . 
  its more of a parisian thing and even then its not the norm, 
  i suppose its more the roma who many romanians basically claim arent actually romanian but if they come from romania to us then they are romanian . 
  walk around london and you will see many , many , many roma panhandling on the streets . 
  i could walk out of my work right now and around the corner sat outside tesco is a dumpy roma woman asking for money , guaranteed , i walk up the road to the sainsburys there is a roma guy asking for money , a little further up the road there is another bloody sainburys with another dumpy roma woman . 
  i can guarantee you they are there as i walk past them everyday . 
  the biggest group of foreign homeless in london are from romania , they are currently on track to overtake homeless people from the uk . 
  whilst its easy to say ` but they are going there to work why dont brits want them ? ', 
  the people coming here to work arent the ones you see everyday , you dont notice them as they look just like everyone else . 
  but everytime you go to the supermarket you are asked for money from someone sitting on the street dressed in traditional roma clothes that is the image you get of people from that country . 
  you 're literally defending blasphemy laws . 
  saying its alright denmark has them because the uk only fully got rid of them in 08, 
  it was abolished a decade ago . 
  we stopped prosecuting people long before that . 
  [ last successful case was in 1977 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blasphemy_law#united_kingdom ) . 
  whilst in denmark you are * still * prosecuting people . 
  im sorry that you think its acceptable to prosecute people with blasphemy laws in this day and age but its not . 
  my point . 
  and in denmark ? 
  yeah find someone being prosecuted under any of them and i 'll be impressed . 
  but denmark * are * prosecuting people on out dated laws . 
  we have laws here that protect people from outdated laws , as apparently thats easier than getting rid of old laws, 
  the feelings mutual . 
  literally trip over romanians asking for money everytime i leave the supermarket . 
   northern ireland is complicated . 
  protestants are evil , and have yearly marches to remind everyone of that vitriol . 
  i mean , there probably is a reason brits dominate on / r/ladyboners and / r/gentlemanboners . 
  sarcasm , not irony, 
   their beaches are full of stones instead of sand .

  you know scotland is part of the uk ? 
  i dont know why you 're singling out the scottish entries . 
  i 've met well traveled americans who think eating any organ is gross . 
  you guys are pretty soft when its comes to variety in your dishes .
