  being a tourist in turkey is exhausting , constantly grabbed by people trying to pull you into their bloody restaurant . 
  or you could go to really non touristy places and have such a language barrier its pointless trying to communicate . 
  what are you talking about , germany is great . 
  the cities are beautiful and the people are lovely . 
  im going back in just over a month and cant wait . 
   try going to other parts of the country you would be suprised how different amsterdam is compared to the rest . 
  oh god the endless fields , its like being trapped in a colourful purgatory . 
  i think you will shocked at how everywhere in northern/western europe is pretty much the same culture . 
  i suppose the brits and irish drink more and the germans and dutch a generally nicer but thats about it, 
  boring as fuck, 
  why is man u placed over london whilst arsenal is placed over manchester ? 
  im calling bullshit on you not being able to find news on these 1400 rape cases , this has been huge news in the uk over the past few weeks and had been bbc frontpage news over that time also its not the only case.i wrote `` 1400 rape '' into google and i got thousands of links . 
  ive included links to other similar ` sex gangs ' that are mainly from pakistani heritage , there is a guardian article somewhere that says that at least 80 % of these gangs are pakistani and 11 % are from other muslim countries . 
  i cant find them right now but somewhere this an article about an iman that promoted the rape of white women to punish them for their sins , . 
  this is all nation wide and has been happening for decades . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochdale_sex_trafficking_gang http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derby_sex_gang http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxford_sex_gang, 
  either way the vote swings they will still be british . 
  scots are british . 
  they are from the island of great britain, 
  music festivals are very important . 
  to go a year without going to at least one major festival is very odd in my group of friends . 
  fashion is kinda important , its weird as no one really talks about it that much but people do always put an effort in and try to stick to ` their ' style . 
  i dont know if i would quite say we ` love ' fashion but it is important to lots of people gin and tonic . 
  i know we are famous for our love of tea but we also do love g&t presuming the worst about everyone and everything especially when regarding politics . 
  sunday roasts . 
  im not sure to what extent the rest of europe have sunday roasts and if they 're aware that we do , but we fucking love them . 
  drinking just a few pints with colleagues after work . 
  those two pints are bonding . 
  seeing as its near bath , bristol , wells and various other things i think its worth dropping by . 
  you can hit all those places easily in a day, 
  scots and brits are the same thing . 
  you 're thinking of english/scots who are both british as well as the welsh and northern irish depending on who you talk to, 
  i really should n't be so sensitive over such trivial things but god fucking damn it . 
  its ** our ** language . 
  probably less recognisable than kernow which is just silly . 
  the home counties , bristol and bath are all very wealthy places . 
  im a little bit sceptic , economically i believe the rest of the eu dont like london 's hold on fiancee markets and want to spread it out to other countries markets for a move even distribution i dont believe this is fair . 
  [ for example trying to take trading into the eurozone was a pretty blatant and illegal move ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/14/european-central-bank-treasury-court-action ) . 
  i also dont really like the immigration laws , i view them as unfair and if anything a little racist . 
  the uk currently has to try and cut down on immigration because we 're getting full , the eu 's current laws says we have to accept every eu immigrant so basically those from other countries outside the eu have a much , much smaller chance on getting in . 
  you could be a young dr from india/china/us and have shit loads of prospects but a french/german/spanish or whatever person who maybe a criminal or something is seen as more important because they are from our little bubble . 
  i believe a persons merits should be taken into account when applying for immigration not their current nationality . 
  i basically think without a bunch of reforms the uk should leave , [ this article sums up a lot of the economical stuff ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10793681/without-reform-it-would-be-best-for-britain-to-leave-eu.html ), 
  still not correct . 
  im guessing lots of royal marines as they 're usually the first into the fight ? 
  uk here from a southern city . 
  most of male friends will exchange a kiss when pissed or havent seen each other for a while, 
  views of the people have nothing to do with the stance of the government . 
  you are aware that we hate ourselves and government right ? 
  nobody thought the germans were quite as stark raving mad as they were . 
  we all learnt not to trust the lunacy of germans back then . 
  there nothing socially awkward about hating everyone . 
  human rights issues including racism and homophobia as well as rampant corruption . 
  2 are on the way to joining and one is one the way to ( potentially ) leaving . 
  both have one foot out the door , not really ironic . 
  til wtf the council of europe is . 
  a lot of those agin bring up points about tokyo being one of the most densely populated cities in the world . 
  i thought it was ridiculously expensive . 
  yeah apparently acknowledging this is raciest according to those on the left here, 
  i think f1 is more popular than snooker and maybe even tennis except when wimbledon is on . 
  surprised [ bath , uk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bath,_somerset ) didnt get a mention . 
  you 're right apart from the beef . 
  why import argentine beef when we have aberdeen angus right here ? 
  still bloody expensive though . 
  [ just look at the prices ] ( http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/food-and-wine/food-to-order/lunches-and-dinners/main-courses ) - 43 euros for a stuffed chicken . 
  he was just so damn clever , [ the foerign land speech still speaks volumes today ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_hague#.22foreign_land.22_speech ) , i suggest you keep reading past that and read about his ` skill in debate ', 
  oh yeah people forget that ` blair mania ' was a very real thing , people adored the bloke . 
  just look at the footage of when he came into power , i cant find it now but there is footage of him and cherry hugging scores of people outside no . 
  10 , and i mean there was shit loads of people there to congratulate him . 
  it 'll be a long time before you see the public so happy to welcome a new pm into office , we 're a much more cynical bunch now . 
  the thing is though no matter how great a speaker blair was he was always categorically shown up by the lyrical genius that is william hague , that man just absorbed the quick wit and sharp insults that public school boys get like no other . 
  im sure this has nothing to do with the eurozone facing massive losses due to the sanctions . 
  whilst being a massive tawt blair [ didnt do half bad in pmq 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azumeghmcy8#t=246 ), 
  i think thats just the affect of graphics , the [ shard ] ( http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/multimedia/dynamic/00261/p2_shard_261200k.jpg ) , [ another pick ] ( http://www.theiet.org/membership/member-news/31/images/640_shard-640.jpg ) does kinda fit in but its [ graphic mock up looked odd ] ( http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/internet/geographies/europe/news/images/shard_london_uk_mainimg.jpg ), 
  why is the base smaller than the top ? 
  they look dangerous . 
  how is lidl viewed in other countries ? 
  here it is generally viewed a very cheap and somewhere where the lower classes shop . 
  i think our list from poor to expensive goes something like aldi / lidl / iceland / asda / tescos / sainsburys / waitrose / marks and sparks - its be cheaper to eat out every night than shop there . 
  i find driving on the continent pretty easy if im in a foreign car , the only thing is giving way to the left on roudabouts rather than the right is easy to forget . 
  im sure you wont find things too difficult here if you 're using a british car . 
  im loving this trend of lists of european things, 
  kinda busy being the last line of defense . 
  what about ` the war on drugs ' or ` the war on terrorism ' ? 
  old mushy peas have the texture of pure unadulterated hate . 
   the british working environment is so shit, 
  id refute that . 
  i get paid pretty well and really like the people i work with . 
  pretty common in bristol . 
  the clifton suspension bridge is kinda edited . 
  the water there is actually a mucky brown , [ like this ] ( http://carhirebristolairportonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/clifton.jpg ) i 've lived in clifton all my life and i 've always loved the bridge , especially at night . 
  i 'd go for [ wells ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/wells_cathedral_west_face_exterior,_uk_-_diliff.jpg ), 
  your point is solid but in my limited experience of talking to jewish people about israel every single jewish person i know says that our media is biased and that israel is good whilst every muslim i know vehemently condemns the actions of any extremest muslim group . 
  so your point about the uk leaving whilst we 're ` facing russia ' is mute ? 
   they should focus more on educating , integrating and promoting humanist reform for immigrating peoples . 
  they are . 
  the immigration being controlled isnt down to reasons of not wanting certain cultures , it is down to the uk being overpopulated, 
  so in reality your problem with the uk maybe leaving is over the fact russia is edging towards a war , you are aware that the uk is the largest force in the eu ? 
  europe 's military might would dramatically shrink without the uk . 
  pretty sure most europeans are,
