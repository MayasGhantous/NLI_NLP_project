  most people in the uk hope that charles will be skipped and the crown will go to wills when elizabeth kicks it, 
  athens is in greece mate . 
  prince charles ? 
  what ? 
  like our royals is one thing but he is the most disliked royal of them all . 
  the indian food you ate in london is most likely not traditional . 
  it mostly anglo-indian . 
  i 've spent more time in india than any other country bar the uk and i barely saw any of the dishes that i have grown up with here in the uk . 
  also my mother is anglo indian ( english parents but was born and grew up in india just after the raj ) and her side of the family all cook what us westerners presume to be indian food when in fact its a british take on some indian dishes . 
  a pub lunch on a sunday will be getting a roast dinner at your local , strongly recommend you do this if you ever visit . 
  probably france . 
  big fan of the alps and i like the people , i just wish i was better at the language . 
  its just called england mate , new england is a state in the usa named after england, 
   pub demographics . 
  what do you mean ? 
  well the one my father teaches at is about 5/10 mins walk from my house which is in the middle of a big english city , i regularly see the students around my area . 
  i think before 6th form they are confined to certain areas in the city but after that they have free reign . 
  i went to a different school but i had friends who went there when i was in school who i met through mutual friends , these guys were all brits though . 
  from what i can tell they tend to spend most of their time on the school grounds playing sports when they 're not doing homework , the school runs 6 days a week and they have all have a bunch of out of hours activities like sports clubs and homework/revision clubs etc. 
  so i suppose they dont spend much time in society but what teenagers do spend time ` in society ' they do obviously ingest british media and spend time with british students and teachers who hopefully project a different image of our country than the one where they are from . 
  `` are n't they just together with other rich kids with similar backgrounds ? 
  that can be said for all private schools . 
  we 're not talking just about university we 're talking about boarding schools so the kids are going to pick up on more of the society whilst here than if they just went to university . 
  my father teaches at a very highly regarded boarding school , it costs about # 30,000 a year to send your kid there . 
  lots of the students are the sons and daughters of chinese diplomats but there also a lot of russian kids who parents are in high ranking government roles . 
  hopefully a western education can perhaps stop these kids being dicks like their parents when they inevitably go into russian politics . 
  this article is acting like war memorials are something that praise war when in reality they are there as a sign of remembrance of the dead , statues to remind us of the causalities of war and the horror of war . 
  quite the opposite of praising war in . 
  you 're forgetting places thorpe park , drayton manor , oakwood ,, 
  do you even rollercoast ? 
  i hate the fact in the uk lots of people think that if we leave the eu we will suddenly have to get visas to travel there and such . 
  so many people are n't aware of the positions that countries like norway and switzerland who are not in the eu hold . 
  the same goes with trade , it wont just stop all together as that wouldnt help anyone . 
  the video decided to avoid the question as why russia ` had ' to invade the ukraine . 
  the dutch monarchy are the largest share holder in shell which is a company thats incorporated in the uk so the money shell makes they have to pay corporation tax on meaning that the dutch monarchy are paying taxes to the uk gov. 
  so it turns out the dutch monarchy are paying corporation tax to the british government #gittaxed, 
  an organised and longer list [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_european_companies_by_revenue ), 
  shell is incorporated in the uk so i think whilst its hq is in the netherlands its tax monies go to her majesties government . 
  - i think , tax laws are deliberately confusing . 
  is this in bristol ? 
  if so , where ? 
  you do have a point but the government saying that you can name your kid a foreign name is bloody ridiculous, 
  well technically christmas time is actually yuletide and here in the uk the word yule is still used although i dont think most people know why, 
  wales, 
  also camps in the uk but richer families will send their kids to the south of france, 
  that stat actually comes from ; ` in the uk there are 10,459 rough sleepers and 98,750 households in temporary accommodation ' - some they 've been given shelter but are rescribed as homeless because they dont own the shelter they have been given . 
  compare this too ; netherlands ; an estimated 30,000 people are homeless in the netherlands italy ; an estimated 17,000 people are homeless in italy hungary ; approximately 10,000 people are homeless in budapest - budapest alone !, 
  greece ; homelessness in greece has risen from 17,000 in 2009 to 20,000 in 2010 germany ; an estimated 254,000 people are homeless in germany france ; an estimated 1 million people are homeless in france - an estimated 100,000 people live on the streets in france http://www.homelessworldcup.org/content/homelessness-statistics, 
  you are completely mental . 
  what like being one of the largest contributors to the eu ? 
  giving 4.7 billion more that it receives . 
  being one of the most charitable countries in the world ( 5th ) despite have a population that pales in comparison to many countries . 
  it must be because we 're really right wing , i mean its not like we 're the most friendly place to live if you 're homosexual , wait no we are actually . 
  what humane democratic values are we talking about here ? 
  http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union https://www.cafonline.org/media-office/press-releases/2011/dec-2011/uk-fifth-most-charitable.aspx http://iuwest.wordpress.com/2012/05/18/uk-earns-ranking-as-most-gay-friendly-country-in-europe/, 
  the american multinationals dont make up most of london 's finance jobs, 
  essentially you 're putting someone in power who you believe will lead the eu down a path you disagree with for the sake of saving face and making the eu look more unified . 
  what the point of making something look stronger when its heading in a direction you disagree with ? 
  better to be driving a dirty looking car where you need to go than be driving a fancy looking car the wrong way, 
  supporting a new pres of the eu who will do things they disagree with so that they can continue to be in the favour of the parliament . 
  the system is ridiculously bureaucratic and backwards . 
  i must admit i dont know a great deal about how the eu parliament operates but the more i know ( i hate to say this ) the more i understand some of farage 's points . 
  none of the men in ww1 fought for an eu . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  why dont you answer ace 's question rather than posing a different one . 
  no matter the uk 's wishes why would france be given the right to not listen to them because more of its citizens died during ww1 ? 
  same in uk ( where i live anyway ) . 
  we all know they are brothels , they have been there for decades and they keep the pros off the streets so they might as well stay, 
   why would it have to be one single evil force at work ? 
  what the comment you 're replying to should have said was ` military industrial complex ' , its what eisenhower feared would happen when leaving office and [ he made his fears very clear in a farewell speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg-jvhynp9y ) . 
  the military industrial complex has contributed to glorifying war in the us off the back of the 2nd world war . 
  for example ; the world was in peril from a terrible evil , we needed to stop it so we created a huge army and saved everyone , thanks to our massive army we stopped terrible crimes . 
  this does not mean we 're safe , we need to keep funding our army to stop more evils ( new evils being the war on terror ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military%e2%80%93industrial_complex, 
  shit over the course of 5 years he changed his opinion ? 
  god damn what a flipper flopper . 
  actually he has n't changed his opinion the conservatives still want a referendum . 
  here he is sayong he believes that we should stay in the eu , but people want a referendum , so we 'll have one . 
  that does n't mean he wants to leave , that means he 's putting it up to the people of the uk to make that choice , you know ? 
  democracy . 
  also he has good reason for wanting to stay in the eu compared with 5 years ago when the opinions were a little more grey . 
  the recent eu elections have show a huge increase in anti eu opinions that the uk has had for years but have now spread across the continent . 
  before when it was just the uk asking for reforms he knew on their own change would not happen but now he has the attention of everyone else like france for example who have seen parties like the fn gain loads of support . 
  thats actually more accurate . 
  i think its pretty fucking disrespectful to call the man medals tacky when he is attending a remembrance service for a military action . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knight_grand_companion_of_the_new_zealand_order_of_merit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/companion_of_the_queen%27s_service_order http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venerable_order_of_saint_john http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_zealand_operational_service_medal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_zealand_general_service_medal_1992_ ( non-warlike ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_timor_medal he earnt every single one of those and should wear them with pride . 
  really ? 
  there was an applause when he arrived the same as everyone else . 
  the big screen showing all the public and dignitaries what was going on showed a split image of obama and putin and everyone laughed including the two presidents who then looked at each other and nodded . 
  have you been under a rock all day ? 
  ex nz sas , hence the medals . 
  kinda hard for the uk because there are some pretty big differences between the average house in the north and south . 
  where i live ( south west england ) the average house looks something [ like this ] ( http://media.rightmove.co.uk/10k/9265/34413616/9265_2569461_img_00_0000.jpg ) or you get flats from split up georgian houses like [ this ] ( https://a2.muscache.com/pictures/26347608/x_large.jpg ) - i actually grew up in one of those . 
  modern apartments look [ like this ] ( http://media.rightmove.co.uk/17k/16974/42378494/16974_348091582b_p2891_img_01_0000.jpg ) and modern houses look [ like this ] ( http://www.bristolextensions.com/wp-content/themes/gazette/thumb.php?src=http://www.bristolextensions.com/wp-content/woo_uploads/2-new_build_-_domestic_properties.jpg&amp;h=280&amp;w=595&amp;zc=1&amp;q=90 ) - absolutely disgusting imo, 
  its 4 times the size of bucharest , its pretty fucking big . 
  being a european capital does n't automatically make it a major city . 
  i would be wiling to bet that the majority of european adults could n't tell me what the capital of romania is . 
  there is an amazing documentary called dark days about those who live underground in ny , the making of is also worth a watch . 
  also bucharest isnt exactly a major city . 
  it only has 2 million people , whilst large its still compariable to the likes of ny, 
  i think that polling is always done towards an older crowd .
