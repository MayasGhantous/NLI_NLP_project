  students and other young people cant be fucked to answer polls . 
  again from my link . 
  `` only polling companies that are members of the british polling council , and therefore fully disclose their findings and methodology , are shown in this section . '', 
  the other sections are irrelevant . 
  from my own link . 
  yes in may 2011 = 37 % no = 45 % yes in may 2014 = 34 % no = 46 % where are you getting your numbers ? 
  the ` threat ' has n't really grown at all since the start . 
  polls have barely changed . 
  if anything the yes voters have gone down since the start of the campaign https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_scottish_independence_referendum,_2014, 
  reddit is not in the us ? 
  our hate speech laws are fucking ridiculous but `` the question of whether michael hess 's statement is true , or at least for michael hess appeared to be true , is irrelevant to the proceedings . '' is utter madness . 
  if the truth hurts then you cant say it ? 
  that is insane . 
  no idea we ever even won it, 
  can you even source that ? 
  i dont know much about comic books but apparently he is a half decent character . 
  quadcopter . 
  you mean [ captain britain ] ( http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100324031452/marveldatabase/images/f/fc/captain_britain_vol_1_27.jpg ) ? 
  years gone by ? 
  are n't golden dawn the strongest they 've ever been ? 
  twice the population of canada it would be expected . 
  italy is a member of the g7 and has an economy thats about as strong as wet paper towel . 
  the more i learn about credit ratings the more i realise they 're as corrupt as a russian working for fifa . 
  these are the same companies that told investors/banks to put their money into mortgagees that were falling apart . 
  i dont know why you 're being downvoted . 
  everything you 've said is entirely feasible . 
  you want us to be like the usa ? 
  it just wouldnt work anytime for next few decades , there are countries in the union that are still developing and are n't comparable with the countries that have massive infrastructure / finance / manufacturing . 
  maybe in 50 + years things will be more equal and then it could have a chance . 
  yeah but this is / r/europe so whatever makes the uk look bad is always relevant, 
  i do agree , i dont think ` tests ' are a fair way to measure ones intelligence . 
  no i was acting like it was n't ` bullying ', 
  theres a difference between being given money and then being fucked up for not repaying and just being given money, 
  kinda , i have two accents ` bristolian ' and ` middle class southern ' . 
  i wouldnt ever speak bristolian if was n't talking to another bristolian as its hard to understand if you 're not from here . 
  yeah , im bristolian but from a very posh part so normally i have a typical southern middle class accent , there is a currently a builder working in my house and the west country definitely comes out of me when i speak to him . 
  because everyone already knows everything about us . 
  our tv shows are some of the most watched in the world , particularly our factual tv and it basically has given the rest of the world an a fucking great big insight into our culture . 
  wallah is a arabic/hindu suffix for someone doing something . 
  i think he was making a pun on the armies of the raj that were mainly comprised of hindus, 
  what !? 
  surely our fights were better though ... . 
  what about those of us who are europeans and spend our time partying in other european cities ; barcelona/berlin/amsterdam / munich/krakow/prague / budapest/london/dublin all cities that have many options on having a good time - where do we go to party in france ? 
  mate ... . you just let the queen 's be corrected by a frog , please sort your life out . 
  i 've never heard of bullying that involves being given [ 14 billion pounds ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9813358/british-taxpayers-funded-irelands-14bn-bail-out.html ), 
  only if they chose to come here in boats rather than fly , perhaps the weather could do us another favour . 
  no k is a completely different drug . 
  k is ketamine which is a tranquilliser commonly used for horses and other livestock and can be used as a alternative to morphine in humans . 
  the drugs comes as a liquid but once heated ( simply chucked in a frying pan on low heat ) it turns into a white powder which can be snorted . 
  its very cheap and highly addictive and imo really shit but lots of my friends love it . 
  why should immigrants be expected to leave everything behind ? 
  because they 're leaving everything behind by emigrating . 
  i 'm going to put it bluntly , you 're american you dont know what you 're talking about . 
  i cant fathom why anyone would bitch about getting coke instead of kay . 
  not even london but yeah london is ridiculous getting on the underground is like walking into a spanish call centre . 
  i live in bristol which seems to attract the spanish with the dreadlocks and massive gage earrings and drugs , they fucking love our drugs . 
  where i went to uni ( bournemouth ) was also ridiculous as its only a small city but its got a few language schools so about 40 % of the population is spanish . 
  it does seem like every recent grad from spain is currently sitting in the parks of my city . 
  freedom of speech doesnt technically exist in the uk . 
  you can be imprisoned and or fined for being offensive . 
  people like the wbc and kkk are banned from entering the uk . 
  its not like we 'll lose our visa status , the swiss and the norwegians can freely travel in europe . 
  the main problem is unskilled jobs that are normally taken by young people are being taken by immigrants who are more skilled , you have students who cant get a simple bar job to help fund their university course because its been taken by someone who has years and years of experience in some field and has moved to the uk to work but ended up having to forget their field and take a minimum wage job . 
  i 've met many spanish people who are unhappy that their degree cant get them work in the field they want to here , they instead get part time work around 10 hours a week so that they can also get housing benefit . 
  i 've been to croatia a few times and never noticed any sausages , everyone was eating pizza . 
  i take it you wont be vaccinating your kids or even taking any sort of injection , using anything thats been made with a hydraulic press ( all mass manufactured good , buildings made using cranes ) anything that uses and electric motor , telephones , light bulbs , television , carbon fibre , jet engine , world wide web ( what are you doing on reddit ? ), 
  penicillin , toilets with a flush , fizzy drinks , [ the list goes on ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lists_of_british_inventions ) we 're sorry . 
  sausages , well done germany . 
  whilst changing policies and generally pandering to their audience to try and swing them back to the tory party . 
  i take it putin is just another us puppet ? 
  if burning your money is too slow , why not greek bonds !, 
  well done lad, 
  there is a comment in / r/unitedkingdom where a guy uses it properly and without trying to bend the conversation to it as it was relative to the subject , it was glorious . 
   it 's very rarely used not really . 
  do you have any siblings ? 
  where are you siblings ? 
  what is your sibling doing ? 
  where did he get that lighter ? 
  why is he burning things ? 
  why did you let him climb up there ? 
  what it he doing ? 
  are you going to stop him ? 
  are all very common phrases . 
  i feel like these photos show the same pictures as the other album . 
  am i missing something ? 
  spot ? 
  his trousers are soaked . 
  nuclear is obviously not being included . 
  which is obviously not reusable but a darn site better than burning coal . 
  i thought the whole point about this post was saying `` look , serbia used to be bad but is now good come visit '' . 
  op even says `` when will you accept us ? 
  when will you start visiting us and start realising that we 're , in fact , very nice people '' and now you 're saying we should accept that they 're not as accepting and as open to different types of people as us , pretty contradictory . 
  what ? 
  i think theres also things like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgrade_anti-gay_riot ) that basically make serbia look backwards . 
  also i have been to serbia once , i have also witnessed genuine violence/hatred towards a black person once ( guys to kick the shit out of my mate for being black/foreign ) - seeing things like that basically brings back the old views of seriba . 
  want people to look at serbia in a new light ? 
  then dont accept raciest , homophobic thugs . 
  i 've im sure ive seen the beeb do it the long way recently . 
  uk still does . 
  there have been huge numbers of mass immigration in the past a lot of these immigrants have refused to become a part of british society and that resulted in generations divided .
