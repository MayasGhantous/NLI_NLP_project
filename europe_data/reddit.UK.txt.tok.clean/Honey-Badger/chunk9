  i just want to see what happens, 
  the fact that the uk has given multiple times more in aid to the region around syria than anyone else in the eu is being ignored whislt we 're told we 're bad people for not letting in refugees when multiple other countries have let in way less than us gets on peoples nerves . 
  no point of being in a union of countries who endlessly find reasons to make you be the bad guy, 
  where im from ( bristol ) was the biggest port during the days of the new world , lots pirates and sailors came from here most notably blackbeard . 
  anyways , in school we learnt loads of sea shanties almost all of which i have forgotten now . 
  no , few years later, 
  not actually from ireland . 
  about an irish bloke and very much adopted by the irish but written in london by an englishman to an american tune . 
  see if someone told me that was a form of gaelic i wouldnt doubt em . 
  things like [ scarborough fair ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg7okbjgz3c ) , [ greensleeves ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rrmojc-djg ) - yes we all know it wasnt written by henry the 8th . 
  also got the [ sea shanties ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulwxvzl6nua ) and all that business . 
  theres a few military based ones like [ grenadiers march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oivspy8xy9i ) which was basically exactly what the title says it was . 
  i think my favourite of all our old songs would be [ jerusalem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=041nxaan714 ) - there is an argument for this to be the english national anthem as well as [ land of hope and glory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpewpk_dl7m ) , i think jerusalem would be better, 
  cafes and bars are pretty different, 
  yes im aware of how it is possible . 
  im not aware as to why youre on reddit in public . 
   in a random street bar of lille , i do believe i have it nicely . 
  i was quoting him, 
  probbs norway . 
  amazing landscapes , nice people , wealthy, 
  so nice youre on reddit whilst in bar ? 
  that is not normal, 
  many people in london arent british citizens and also i suppose no , i dont think i 've ever seen a black person refer to white people as there people . 
  there are huge racial divides in the uk , multiculturalism has failed , i really think people should watch the channel 4 doc ` things we dont say about race ' . 
  when minorities are actually in the minority they tend to adapt to the country/culture that they are in but when they become the majority in their community they adapt that community to their way of life and view the rest of the country as completely different to their community, 
  the majority of london is no longer white british . 
  i dont mind lots of people from different part of the world moving to my country if they have something to give but i dont like the idea of my capital city no longer being home to my people, 
  or jordan if he fancied going south, 
  `` 3 some results from key partners , including un agencies , are not yet included due to a lag in reporting . '', 
  - so no . 
  well i suppose so . 
  leaving those people to die in their homes isnt very peaceful . 
  the point you are really getting at here is the situation of are we going to send people in to sort this mess out ? 
  and to that no one knows what the best idea is . 
  i cant see any decisions having a happy ending, 
  you 're welcome . 
  oh and , cameron announced another 100 million today brining it up to a nice rounded off # 1billion for the area surrounding syria, 
  lol . 
  taken in many times that of greece , spain , ireland , belgium , croatia , romania , the list goes on, 
  it is . 
  the uk list the sort of things the money is spent on . 
  this is what # 900million of the now # 1billion was spent ok ; https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/455330/dfid_syria_crisis_response_summary__2015.08.20_.pdf, 
  someone 's got to be the go to bad guy . 
  it just happens to be us, 
  the billion that has been spent in the region around syria is making huge changes . 
  the uk gov site lists them all https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/455330/dfid_syria_crisis_response_summary__2015.08.20_.pdf, 
  more will/have settled in the uk than spain , greece , ireland , denmark , belgium , romania , croatia etc etc, 
  i like how the eu loves to ignore the fact that the uk has given multiple times more aid than everyone else to the region around syria since the start of the conflict . 
  we are now on # 900 million worth of aid , germany in 2nd place spent about a third of that . 
  we 're still the bad guys though for some stupid reason . 
  the bbc 's job is to be as neutral as possible and dictate the events in an unbiased way and thats exactly what they did here . 
  to be honest i saw that early today and immediately presumed the guys had jumped on the tracks and the police are getting them off . 
  is it meant to show something different ? 
  the guy is leaning away from the officer hugging the rails , not trying to get up . 
  if it could be argued that they fell in a awkward way and the bbc said they were jumping on the tracks then the bbc gets in shit . 
  from what i 've seen many irish people write about the uk on reddit i wouldnt be surprised if a good amount of them believe that the uk would leave the eu just to fuck with them . 
  yeah because france * really * wanted us to the join the eu didnt they . 
  i sometimes need to remind myself that the average european doesnt hate me for being british . 
  i swear so many people here think the uk created all their problems . 
  rather than new member states electing to join nato the russians view more as nato taking over countries near them . 
  they view the growth of nato not as countries making diplomatic decisions to join the organisation but as the organisation conquering their neighbours, 
  its the argument that because we are ` lucky ' to be born in x country why should people who are ` unlucky ' to be born in poor countries have a worse life than us ? 
  which i think is stupid . 
  my island is in a good state because my ancestors worked hard for it to be this way , it wasnt luck , it was them providing for further generations . 
  if migrants keep fleeing their failing countries those countries will only continue to fall apart . 
  if they really cared for future generations they would fight to make things right where they are . 
  well it looks like we will be * forced * to tell sweden to get fucked . 
  you clearly have never drunk real cider . 
  the stuff you see outside of the west country would be like calling lambrini a wine . 
  that 'll get you a fucking slap where im from . 
  its not exactly crystal ball levels of prediction to presume that mass levels of immigration will be met with mass levels of hostility . 
  well it 'd be a stately home . 
  actually the full quote you want is ; * upon it depends our own british life and the long continuity of our institutions and our empire . 
  the whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us . 
  hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war . 
  if we can stand up to him , all europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad , sunlit uplands . 
  but if we fail , then the whole world , including the united states , including all that we have known and cared for , will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister , and perhaps more protracted , by the lights of a perverted science . 
  let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties , and so bear ourselves that , if the british empire and its commonwealth last for a thousand years , men will still say , `` this was their finest hour '' . 
  * continuation of british life ? 
  check . 
  free europe ? 
  check . 
  the world moving forwards ? 
  check . 
  stopping the rest of the world including the us falling into abyss ? 
  check . 
  [ we get beer and cheese on fridays ] ( http://imgur.com/mchx9s7 ), 
  i was telling a mate about the west african squadron a few weeks ago and he didnt believe me , none of my mates did . 
  they were all convinced we were nothing but dicks during that period . 
  yeah they knew about us obviously , however they couldnt seem to understand that despite the fact im white my mother was born and grew up there . 
  i chose to talk too much about the history of my mothers family in that regard as its a bit embarrassing . 
  they just viewed the uk as this far away land where all the other white people live . 
  no real knowledge of europe and north america , these were people in some very deprived place though , the indians you meet in cities like bangalore / delhi / mumbai ( or bombay as my mother calls it ) are very informed on such matters . 
  trying to think to shows that you forrins may not have heard of , the big ones being dr who , sherlock , downton abby , top gear . 
  less known shows maybe ; luther , the it crowd , peep show , the fall , peaky blinders , shameless, 
  yeah i have , in rural india . 
  to be fair i was the first white person some of these people had ever met . 
  i had to explain it was nowhere near the us, 
  oh , * thats * why you invaded poland and gassed millions of jews . 
  til,
