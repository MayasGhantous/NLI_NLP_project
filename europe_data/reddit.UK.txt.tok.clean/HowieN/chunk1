something something , british food . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of us do n't think our referendum was rigged . 
  i hope that 's the case anyway ... 
  do yew now ? 
  if it does n't understand you , your vote counts ? 
  yes , so you did ( presumably responding to someone saying something , agreeing with them ) syrians drinking in gambas ( as it is capitalised , i 'm assuming its a place ) tonight . 
  typing drunken scottish slang , with the obligatory spelling errors in any rant . 
  or being disabled ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ ^ hits ^ ^ ^ ^ particularly ^ ^ ^ ^ close ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ home ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ me or not being heterosexual or being a jehovah 's witness or lots of other reasons, 
  http://i.imgur.com/k5zyuom.gif thanks for the conversation , it 's mostly been fun . 
  but it 's late . 
  my pc needs to sleep . 
  yeah , the islands are a part of those nations , but technically they 're not a part of great britain . 
  i said that though because you said she was queen of one kingdom ignoring the commonwealth , when it is two kingdoms ; the united kingdoms of ** great britain ** and ** northern ireland ** , as long as you do n't count the kingdoms of scotland and england ( which sort of i think do n't exist any more ) ( wales is/was a part of the kingdom of england ) [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnu8xdbsn10 ) video helps explain some stuff , it also talks a bit about the commonwealth and former crown colonies and other awkward places that are sort of part of the uk . 
  i am awfy slow , but can i use the time as an excuse just now ? 
  ah fair enough , the crowns were joined . 
  * but * you 're not only ignoring the commonwealth , you 're ignoring northern ireland ; * the united kingdoms of great britain and northern ireland * ( also all those islands that are parts of the 4 nations but not great britain or ni , like the isles of white and anglesey , plus the many many scottish islands . 
  as gb is only mainland england , scotland , and wales ), 
  i was just saying i was used to being called silly , nothing else . 
  i think i have some skin , my veins and muscles are n't visible to all the world . 
  edit : woosh, 
  people say that ? 
  well they need to look at a history book . 
  you could say ( my dad does , anything to one up england : \u00fe ) the royal family is more scottish than it is english , since liz i of england ( as a side note , why is the current queen not elizabeth the i & ii ? ), 
  gave england to james . 
  by this logic they are also a lot more german than they are scottish since the hanovers moved in . 
  oh , i was sighing at the way the said ( they have since editied ) they said english monarchy . 
  forgetting the other 3 countries ol liz is also queen of . 
  i was n't sighing at the existence of england and her people . 
  this time . 
  as always . 
  the only thing about reddit you need to know is to never come here . 
  since that failed , have some more whisky . 
  there , there . 
  i 'm sure you 'll learn in no time at all !, 
  i think you should know better than me , you 've been here longer . 
  meh , i 'm used to it . 
  doubt is easy , and if i sound so unsure then people will be less likely to insult me if i am wrong . 
  i knew about the renting the lands , but for some reason i was n't sure who was renting from who . 
  neither was i sure about which brought in more money . 
   the english and dutch monarchies  the * english * and dutch monarchies  the * english * sigh ... but yeah , they bring in a shitload of tourism money . 
  its the taoiseach that does everything though is n't it ? 
  ( in the same way we have liz as the head of state that does nothing , you have your poet ? ), 
  or am i completely wrong like usual ? 
  it 's a reference to a monty python sketch , they have mr hilter ( and some other nazi high ups with subtly different names ) in a hotel looking at a map ( of stalingrad ) planning a walk . 
  another guest tells them its not of the nearby countryside and gets out his map to help them plan his walk , oblivious to who he 's really talking to and why they had a map of stalingrad . 
  evidently i should have posted a link to said sketch , but the only copy i could find was very low quality . 
  or i should just go back to lurking , its much easier . 
  haha , had n't heard that , to the victor goes the wreath ? 
  to the roman empire ? 
  how ? 
  he 's adolf hilter , a brit , and has absolutely no relation whatsoever to adolf hitler . 
  yeah , i was meaning them too . 
  the mods that love balls from your country . 
  yeah , i 'm an active lurker there , so i know that / r/europe has almost 20x the limit for mentioning/x-posting / r/po ... * that * subreddit . 
  and the mods really strict about mentioning elsewhere , but i can understand why , especially when a post gets into / r/all . 
  it has quite a unique brand of humour , that some people from / r/all may take offense at . 
  can we say that here ? 
  but yeah , like that - but maybe just as self posts ? 
  or even just / r/countyjokes or / r/nationaljokes !, 
  it 's also the same in the uk , but maybe not to the same extent . 
  please tell me i was n't the only read this as `` map of putin 's next approval rating '' ? 
  in the fist joke unless the scot is from aberdeen , we should swap the wishes the scot and the welshman say . 
  edit : saw your flair , maybe leave it then ? 
  and drunks , do n't forget the drunks . 
  of course they 're drunks because of the racists and were there first . 
  aah , does your human ( ? ), 
  government have any plans to retake the central territories ? 
  well , at least we now know whats in them ... 
  it , uh , could be worse ? 
  i thought you ceded the central territory to the emus after the war ? 
  not the spiders ? 
  but whiskey is irish , and whisky is scottish . 
  i should know , i have both in my veins . 
  literally . 
  so long as the english are the savages , then you 're basically right . 
  or even further , the entire holy roman empire . 
  that great big blob , or massive mess , in the middle of europe . 
  it , uh , could be worse ? 
  seems a bit weird getting someone to finish creating a language like that . 
  although the [ korean alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hangul ) was also written by one man . 
  we 've been going back an forth for thousands of years , i believe the scots spent quite a bit of time in ireland before coming ( back , probably ) to what we call scotland now . 
  ooh doric , have you seen the disney/pixar film ` brave ' ? 
  that 's what the young guy no one understands speaks ( after looking it up , he 's [ young macguffin ] ( http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/young_macguffin ) ) . 
  okay , so it seems ulster scots is more similar to the scots dialect then ? 
  similar in scotland , we have the scots dialect , and the scots language ( which is nearly dead , and found in small isolated pockets ) many people ( including myself , until a recent post involving the highlands and the appalachian mountains ) think they 're one and the same really , due to the small amounts of scots speakers . 
  perhaps ulster scots is/was the same as this ? 
  and many of the scots that went over to ulster where speakers of the scots language ? 
  here is a series of comments from that post mentioned above , but about scottish scots . 
  ( comments 1 and 3 are from the same person . ), 
   hell , in scotland we speak 3 languages . 
  my own language scots has lots of different dialects and they are very localised . 
  when i leave my area ( which is a bunch of villages ) people struggle to understand me so i have to switch to english to be understood . 
   so even we do n't understand each other a lot of the time . 
   just a heads up to non scots , scots isnae really a proper language . 
  over time it 's merged with the english language and is really a dialect now . 
  do n't get me wrong , it can sound like a different language if you 're not familiar , but it is n't anymore . 
  another example of this is the black country dialect . 
    what you 're the thinking of is scottish english , the scottish dialect of english that takes some influence from scots ( which is this merging you talk about ) . 
  scots the germanic language is different from the more widespread scottish english and is recognised as a minority language by the eu . 
  the scots language is dying out though with not many speakers left , i did n't even speak english till i was 5 ( for context i 'm 20 ) .
