  they 're not foreigners , an irish citizen can theoretically become british prime minister . 
  they 're not citizens though if they 're polish , we just want to treat them like foreigners, 
  i 'm making the distinction between ni and the country th republic of ireland . 
  ireland is the island . 
  nobody wants to go back 100 years mate . 
  they dropped mountbatten, 
  haha ... jacobites still exist ? 
  yes and ? 
  it 's windsor, 
  she is n't german . 
  where is this meme coming from ? 
  her great great grandmother was german . 
  the peace is because of nato and trade not political union but i 'm not debating . 
  you 're free to leave mate , auf wiedersehn, 
  lol, 
  i read that article , and generally dismiss anything the guardian says . 
  i know an irish cabinet minister was on rt\u00c9 talking about no tariffs . 
  i did n't vote leave because of syrian refugees , the uk has an opt out . 
  i voted out for many reasons . 
  my country is taking 20k over 5 years too much but whatever , the number let into europe ( over a million ) is insane . 
  i would be more amenable to the whole of europe letting in like 100k children under 4 , no adults . 
  that way they can be raised and assimilated . 
  alas , not my problem anymore . . 
  you 're english ? 
  i 'm english , glad you 're leaving with an attitude like that, 
  a `` certain number '' was me being euphemistic for `` a lot '' now i bore of going back and forth with a luvvie loon continental bye, 
  did you actually open the article , the roi government is talking about a customs check not going [ back to this ] ( http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/39851000/jpg/_39851523_aughnacloy203.jpg ), 
  i 'm saying that the eu 's border agency frontex should be securing land and sea . 
  if you let a certain number of non european peoples it ceases to be a union of european peoples . 
  zimbabwean dollar omg lol, 
  i did n't say that , i replied to someone who brought up india after someone said it . 
  we did stand up for proper democracy and self determination , in india , in south africa when we opposed apartheid in 1960 , in ireland where we granted them independence instead of sending the army in and crushing it and yes in europe when we saved you all from hitler . 
  i 'm talking about the eu . 
  thought it was supposed to be a european union for the peoples of europe . 
  most of us are proud of the empire , polling reaffirms that and indians in wwii are n't a footnote in the history books we learn all about them wtf ? 
  that paragraph contradicts itself , were they celebrating a festival or rising against the government ? 
  the border controls would be to keep them out . 
  neighbours neighbour you . 
  the eu 's neighbours are ukraine , belarus , russia , turkey , norway , switzerland and soon to be the uk . 
  so is farage 's salary , but i see you complaining . 
  i propose throwing money at the countries that neighbour them to keep them there , and beefing up border control . 
  not one european country borders syria , or iraq or afghanistan . 
  not one . 
  not neighbours . 
  yes , showering them with money . 
  free shelter , free food , free language classes , access to healthcare . 
  do you know how much that costs ? 
  they get the benefits of being european without being actually european . 
  it 's customs checks , the same as the norway sweden border . 
   because you 're a fucking human being . 
  if your neighbour is being blown up , you try to help them by at least giving them shelter . 
  i am baffled as to why i need to explain this to you . 
  are you really that inconsiderate ? 
  they 're not neighbours they 're foreign citizens nobody is talking about syria joining the eu , but showering them with money and giving them visas is just the same . 
  not european should n't get the benefits of europe . 
  absolute madness . 
  mad mad mad mad mad . 
  yes , peaceful . 
  i 'm not talking about 18th century battles and rebellions im talking about the movement to give india independence was peaceful . 
  they participated in civil disobedience and we did n't suppress them . 
  we granted them independence when we did n't have too , because it was the right thing to do . 
  i know it 's shit on britain day out in europe but you can find accurate criticisms of us , pierre . 
   of course they should be allowed in . 
  they 're dying in their country , it 's our duty to help them . 
  especially since we 're part of the problem . 
  holy shit . 
  why is it your duty ? 
  that 's insane . 
  literally insane . 
  then why is it a european union ? 
  why not a world union ? 
  why has madagascar not been offered membership ? 
  this is the beginning of the treaty of rome  his majesty the king of the belgians , the president of the federal republic of germany , the president of the french republic , the president of the italian republic , her royal highness the grand duchess of luxembourg , her majesty the queen of the netherlands ,   determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union ** among the peoples of europe , **   resolved to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide europe ,   affirming as the essential objective of their efforts the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of ** their peoples ** , now it 's the ever closer union part that bothered me which is why i voted to leave , but if you 're going to call that the founding document of europe at least follow it . 
  you 're all mad , mad mad mad . 
  i 'll take the economic hit for awhile just to rid of such madness, 
  yes , the transition to indian independence in the 40s was mostly peaceful . 
  the deaths were indians killing other indians during partition and the population transfers . 
  i know it 's `` shit on britain day '' in euroland but at least be historically accurate . 
  customs checks are n't the same as a hard border, 
  he 's telling him to get off the tram , calling him an immigrant , trying to fight him , yelling racial slurs ... 
  i do n't think that refugees should 've been allowed in . 
  if it 's a european union it should be for europeans no ? 
  every country has killed innoncent people , and ? 
  did you read the statement before posting ? 
  they do n't need it . 
  just like meps should n't get a salary just living expenses while in brussels . 
  by virtue of geography of course we will . 
  why do i hear an american accent ? 
  what does that have to do with immigrants ? 
  he 's speaking manchester it 's quite easy to understand, 
  of course it is , it 's a real job with a salary . 
  he 's calling them professional politicians . 
  not the hundreds of billions of euros spent on refugees ? 
  have fun paying mme le pen 's salary , 
  the country we peacefully gave independence too in 1947 ? 
  yes , the rhetoric about older people is really disgusting . 
  my generation had the numbers to swing the referendum they even had the registration deadline extended but they did n't vote . 
  you do know the petition is being investigated for fraud because there were 10s of thousands of signatures originating in north korea and vatican city right ? 
  farage did n't lead the campaign , vote leave excluded ukip . 
  he 's not in government , he has no power .
