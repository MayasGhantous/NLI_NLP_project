  you make less than $ 1500 a year ? 
  cause universities free there for a guess, 
  surprised it doesnt say spain for the uk, 
  polish people put sugar or custard on potato for some reason, 
  how did you work out he 's a briton ? 
  he 's talking shit about the uk , has an eu flag as his flair and his username is written in elvish or some shit . 
  i do n't know if it 's true that paddington bear drinks with david cameron . 
  i do n't follow football but my favourite i 've heard is `` two world wars and one world cup '' against germany . 
  even if we lose , we 've still won . 
  i 'm really happy that our joke in the uk has become globally known . 
  what a world we live in where even the taiwanese know that the welsh are sheep-shaggers . 
  bliss . 
  `` pouring popping candy under my foreskin was the biggest mistake of my life '' wowwwww, 
  that 's the face of a hero hahaha , love it . 
  nice to see we 're still going strong with the population displacement in ireland, 
  he 'll get assasinated way before that !, 
  ahhhh shes so shittttt . 
  i cant even watch i 'm cringing too much . 
  asking for trade deals to hurry up now is n't gon na make them hurry up any faster than theyve been going for the past couple of decades . 
  the eu doesnt need to suddenly wake up , it 's perfectly awake its just completely dysfunctional . 
  i think the only parties that were pro eu were snp and green . 
  tories were divided , labour were divided , lib dems were divided before they realised they could get opposition votes , and ukip were anti-eu . 
  if you had ever spent an extensive period of time in europe you would not be calling it europe , you 're a total liar . 
  took me so long to get positive karma in / r/unitedkingdom, 
  i hope you do , i would love that . 
  cheer up mardybum . 
  mr pole , us brits do n't want to start wars . 
  we live in a democratic society , we 're very leftwing despite what you may think from recent events , and we do n't believe in war . 
  we 'll do as we 're told we promise !, 
  right now i think that people think that any deal is a good deal , especially an early one that helps us bargain with the eu once article 50 has triggered . 
  maybe trump will give the uk an okay deal , he seems to be quite proud by the fact that his mother is scottish , maybe he 'll just carry on not making decisions with his brain and give the uk a good deal . 
  a big part of the vote for me in brexit was ttip . 
  everyone who i spoke to knew nothing about it , it was quite frustrating to be honest . 
  it 's a shame it did n't really get brought up often in the debate . 
  hey the uk 's pretty stubborn . 
  maybe we 'd end up adding our own trading regulations since we 've always been very against the american standards of health and safety ? 
  you implying the queen ca n't out-cheat trump ? 
  `` keep your friends close , keep your enemies closer . '', 
  we 're not stupid , we have to try and at least cooperate with him , we all do . 
  we 'll sign a free trade agreement, 
  i only realised a few years ago how the weather is n't solely dependant on how close to the equator you are . 
  it 's pretty weird the way it all works . 
  if some geography whizz can explain to me why the fuck the uk is just constantly raining that would be great . 
  lets all agree that theresa may 's a fucking bitch . 
  assuming surgery after some brain damage or something , the clues his tshirt . 
  the dirty 50 % you dirty dutchman !, 
  this is a joke made by someone from finland right ? 
  nope , i 'm just surprised cause compared to uk universities , american universities are so fucking easy it ' a complete joke . 
  compared to uk sixth form and college , american universities are so fucking easy it 's a complete joke . 
  compared to uk compulsary school , american universities still look unprofessional and childish as shit . 
  hey i heard a rumour that when you 're in school in america , part of your grade is dependant on how often you put your hand up ? 
  could you just confirm this for me please ? 
  also could you explain to me what you 're actually supposed to do with an american degree ? 
  i 've really never understood ? 
  like , so you specialise in nothing , and also spend less time specialising in nothing . 
  who does the jobs in america where you actually need to be educated ? 
  i honestly do n't get it ? 
  do you just get taught everything after you 're employed or what ? 
  how do doctors and engineers and scientists get by when they spent 90 % of their time at university doing about stuff that is completely fucking irrelevant to the job they went into ? 
  maybe you do n't understand ? 
  well when i was in school i did every lesson , when i was 13 i dropped pretty much all the humanities , a couple of arts , dropped foreign language and dropped religion . 
  when i moved to sixth form i dropped everything except maths and the sciences . 
  when i went to university i dropped down to only electrical engineering , electronic engineering , computer science and maths . 
  in my third year of university i cut even more so that i 'm only doing electronic engineering , and computer science . 
  if i choose to stay on another year i 'm probably gon na go even more specific , probably just nanoelectronics or vhdl ( chip design ) or something . 
  tell me , why in american universities , if you want a degree in physics . 
  why do you have to do english , maths , biology , chemistry , physics ( twice as much though so its okay lul ) , it , history ( taught badly apparently ) , geography ( taught badly apparently ) , religion , fucking art , fucking god knows whatever the fuck else you have to do . 
  that 's some of the most retarded shocking shit i have ever heard about this planet . 
  why do you need to learn about religion if you want to be an physicist ? 
  why do people with physics degree in america do so little physics ? 
  that 's absolutely fucking retarded . 
  american degrees are fucking worthless and i do n't believe for a second that there is a european degree no matter how undeveloped and behind the country is , that is worse than an american degree . 
  american degrees barely scratch the surface of any subject taught , there 's absolutely no way that a european degree is going to be easier than an american one . 
  shut up , you absolute fucking liar . 
  before tribes apparently the forest in britain was really really really dense , does n't surprise me with the amount of rain . 
  it had to be cut down out of practicality when the people learned how to farm . 
  since there are very few wars right now i do n't think there is a true number , i think 2 % is decent as it shows your commitment to the cause , what makes it correct though is just simply the fact that they all agreed to it . 
  i say we do n't defend them when russia invades them if they are n't hitting the target . 
  i love this trend of lieing about the uk to make you own country look less shit . 
  we have constantly active nuclear detterant subs circling around the britain and ireland . 
  we maintain nuclear weapons . 
  we 're hitting the targets without having to fiddle with the numbers . 
  well if you are n't prepared to meet the target then you shouldnt have joined nato whilst agreeing to reach the target . . 
  & greece , the uk , estonia and poland 's good will . 
  2 % is tiny , the reason that 's the number is to make sure everyone actually pulls their weight which clearly has not worked . 
  its just the number they agreed on yeah . 
  nato is supposed to be about protecting each other and being able to peacekeep for the world . 
  i think people just find it a kick in the dick when countries do n't return the favour . 
  its skanky at the end of the day . 
  uk was just one huge forest before the people learned how to farm . 
  the tribes that were there used to worship trees before some bugger told them about jesus ffs , what happened ? 
  you 're being sarcastic right ? ... 
  well for scotlands size its population doesnt touch the rest of the uk , so they have a lot more room for it . 
  i actually think miss `` england '' , maybe our standards havent changed as much as you 'd think .
