  i thought he was joking , used to throw the occasional silly jew joke at him . 
  met his dad who was a teacher , turns out that they were n't joking and that they actually really really hate jews . 
  i 'm not trying to be contradictory , i 've never heard of racist event happening involving an english person . 
  never ever . 
  worst things i 've heard from english people are football chants at the germans in the euros , which genuinely is light hearted fooling around . 
  i did n't want to leave the eu , but at the same time i thought that it needed improving a lot . 
  it 's a shame that one of the greatest trade alliances ever had to be ruined by power hungry people who felt the need to turn it into a political alliance . 
  i 'd love political alliances with most of the eu ( probably all , just know very little about some of the countries ) , but forcefully through a trade agreement is not how you make political alliances . 
  there 's huge problems in the methodology of the eu , and it 's ruined the entire thing . 
  like , why ca n't the eu comission just be elected ? 
  maybe it does n't matter that they 're unelected , but for the sake of methodology and future and the `` fuck dictators mentality '' , why could n't they have just been elected ? 
  why does angela merkels opinion on immigration have to forcefully consequently allow immigration into britain ? 
  why does angela merkel get to make a decision without any sort of democratic vote that then affects every other eu country ? 
  it 's not democratic . 
  you guys need to tear it down and start again . 
  just stick to the trading , make the political alliances separately . 
  our right wing politicians are more left wing that the us 's left wing politicians though , maybe they like us more than they like the us ? 
  yeah my mate went to live there for 2 years , apparently everyone loved him and kept making a fuss because he was english . 
  by the sounds of it , on the political spectrum they 're somewhere between the uk and us . 
  i do n't know why this guy thinks that australia does n't like us . 
  tell me about the label `` made in germany '' , never heard about this . 
  when in history has china 's huge population made them superior to the uk and its offspring ? 
  i 'm not saying they ca n't compete but your reasoning does n't exactly seem like a strong argument . 
  because it would benefit both sides ? . . 
  maybe the us does n't care about being powerful ? . . 
  `` they ( uk and us ) are also countries of reference when it comes to integrating immigrants or encouraging cultural diversity and religious tolerance . '', 
  you 're right , we are !, 
  if you accept this and also accept that we are not suddenly xenophobic , then will you believe us when we say too much immigration too fast can not be integrated and divides society ? 
  it also hammers your socialist services and when uncontrolled kills your ability to control the job market . 
  solution : do n't stop immigration but control the levels of it . 
  that is n't true . 
  la tene was a culture not people , so essentially just knowledge and way of living . 
  probably was taught through the britons who used to regularly travelled between britain and brittany . 
  the actual people who first settled in the british isles there is evidence of from 10,500 bc , these people eventually became the britons , scots and gaels . 
  la tene culture was 500bce , so about 10,000 years later . 
  yknow i 'd heard loads of stuff about how the people from the netherlands were really nice and friendly , and that it was a really good place to go to basically . 
  i went on holiday there probably about 2 weeks after the brexit result was announced ? 
  a group of 10 of us , lots of us go to university or had been to university , all of us 23 or younger , so the demographic that voted remain , and we all did vote remain . 
  it was aalso a mixed group of boys and girls , none of us are rowdy , do n't fit the dickhead tourist category . 
  literally every person we spoke to was really rude . 
  i got started on in the hotel by 6-ish 40-50 y/o men in the hotel when they heard my accent , i was only with my girlfriend so had to awkwardly talk myself out of it with some next level sarcasm and self deprecration . 
  a lady who worked in a cafe said something like `` ugh english '' glared and then fetched someone else to serve my friend . 
  i know you and the people you talk to probably feel that way , but that 's not the vibe i get from the internet or actually visiting the netherlands . 
  lets go sell some heroin to the chinese !, 
  the britons , scots and gaels were descended from the people who arrived in the ice age . 
  they were first there as far as people know . 
  doggerland still existed for a while after the ice age though ( which was a land between britain and scandinavia ) , we share some of our weird evolutionary traits with them ( [ blue eyes ] ( https://www.earthsdna.net/img/store/product/chromo2-blue-eyes-european-distribution-map.png?1422893584 ) , [ ginger hair ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pmm80ds3uc4/uka-wvq9cwi/aaaaaaaaasu/z3w3oamvpeq/s1600/red-hair-map-of-europe.png ) ect . 
  ) , so you can probably assume that a lot of scandinavians were in the mix for a while too . 
  our country does n't really work like that for a start ... but there 's lots of rich people and politicians who wanted brexit anyway soo . 
  but he did n't campaign ? 
  there is n't a party strong enough to contest conservatives they 're all in a mess , so it 's not very likely we 'll have a vote anytime soon . 
  how many incidents ? 
  how many incidents of mindless violence do we have on the daily anyway ? 
  how many incidents of mindless violence does your country have on the daily ? 
  you 're talking to someone in / r/europe , the hate/dislike in our newspapers is far far far less than the hate we see on here . 
  no it really fucking didnt . 
  if after all these months you think that brexit is about disliking europeans or some retarded shit then you really are a moron . 
  if it went down again , brexit would win by a huge amount . 
  the referendum has shown the eu 's true colours and we do n't like em . 
  we 've also seen the bag of countries that wants to get a trade deal going with us - sounds a lot better than essentially just france and germany ( no offence ) . 
  i 'm sure people in the uk would still like friendly relations with the eu , but i think the aftermath of the brexit vote has made us all even more brexit . 
  they 're demonstrating the ` sovereignty ' of countries in the eu, 
  hahaha , you raise a good point . 
  hmmm . 
  what if we upped the level of snark somehow to make it more obvious ? 
  nothing new then ? 
  ** joinnnn usssss **, 
  i want to take this opportunity to gloat that we beat france . 
  i hate the term `` anglo '' when referring to the uk and it 's offspring . 
  the natives to the uk were britons , scots and gaels , not anglo-saxons ( germans ) . 
  such a stupid term to use . 
  there are people who think that women have more rights than men . 
  the people who did n't put ` very important ' probably did n't want their opinion on `` whether women deserve more rights '' to be misinterpreted . 
  i know that that was n't the question , but that 's how a lot of people work i think . 
  i thought the pope died ? 
  people in the right in switzerland apparently . 
  the uk did n't say anything of the sort no . 
  we 've got ta invite some old commonwealth buddies in too , that cool ? 
  does somebody need to splash water over your face for you to see that the uk wants to leave the eu ? 
  why are you deluding yourself so much ? 
  try living in a part of england that is n't london and then say that, 
  i do n't really understand why people view it as a nationalistic english idea to want to trade with the world rather than just europe ? 
  just asking like . 
  i do n't know who any of these people are and i think i 'm okay with that, 
  yep, 
  whoah whoah whoah , indians and pakistanis are commonwealth , they fought with us in ww1 and ww2 and we have old cultural ties with them . 
  i was n't saying that we wanted more `` anglo-saxons '' ( i wan na point out that i actually hate that term . 
  the natives to britain were n't anglo-saxons , they were britons welsh scots and picts . 
  anglo-saxon are germans who came over who only actually contribute to about 5 % of our dna , calling british people anglo-saxon is totally inaccurate ) . 
  i think that those people actually make it here through loopholes to do with family , or by actually owning business 's , or by being skilled in a profession we need , they 're contributing well to our economy and we 're thankful for them . 
  i do n't really understand your point ? 
  we want less `` anybody '' and more `` skilled that we need '' . 
  it 's a pretty simple logical approach to take no ? 
  it 's because you 've been mislead by a badly labelled/named graph . 
  this graph is imports and exports ** within ** the eu . 
  so imports from the eu by the eu , and exports to the eu from the eu . 
  [ here is belgium 's trade with the world , ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/blx/ ) notice how they import more than they export and that almost all of their export is to th eu assuming the years difference between the data hasnt accounted for much . 
  `` its because its imports from the eu and exports to the eu . '', 
  http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/blx/ look at belgium, 
  a bit part of the brexit campaign was that it was unfair that eu citizens were given special treatment over our ex-commonwealth friends , also every other country , even over skilled workers that we need .
