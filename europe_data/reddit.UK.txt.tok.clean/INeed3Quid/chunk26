  a friend just told me that people aged 18-25 in amber valley , derbyshire , nottinghamshire , keale and newcastle are being `` turned away from voting sam even though they had email confirmation that they were registered and a you gov reference number shady huh huh '' anyone have any source for this or heard anything about this ? 
  what ?!, 
  are people just buying it for paper mach\u00e9 projects then ? 
  i only just finished uni today i do n't even have a job yet !, 
  all u ' shottin ` h 'm lads are rate classy ai ` ere, 
   take money from rich country to give them to `` poor '' country/region of eu is what you said . 
  i see a pretty big difference the uk gives foreign aid to countries that need it . 
  the majority of us do n't give a fuck about countries in the eu , but we do care about ourselves . 
   and dont forget eu fund many project in uk poorest region less than the eu takes in the first place . 
  we could just not give it to the eu and give more to the poorer regions without the eu . 
   you overestimates a lot the power of ecj on the ability of uk to fix their own problem . 
  no i do n't . 
  i 'm fully aware of the problems that the uk causes on itself and then blames on the eu . 
  but that does n't stop what the eu does to the uk from being bad . 
  the eu took power away from the uk ( uk 's highest court is europe right now ) , then took money from the whole of the uk ( including and consequently the poor ) and gave the money to other countries . 
  exactly what you just said no ? 
  i see in colour not black and white . 
  i know all of this and i did n't vote for brexit , just wanted to point out that your arguement was massively flawed . 
  you know that you were educated in a marxist school system right ? 
  ( apparently they did n't do a very good job , so i can see why you might be annoyed ) you have marxist healthcare , you have marxist public services and a marxist local council . 
  the problem is n't really that the youth turnout is low , the problem is that we have fuck loads of old people, 
   semi democratic meaning what exactly ? 
  [ 47 % misrepresentation nationally ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rgx91rq5i ), 
  i think we have some funky genetics honestly, 
  so do a harder job , get paid a bit more but also get taxed more . . 
  were you trying to make it sound worse or better hahaha, 
  i finished uni today . 
  fingers crossed for wiping my # 27k debt and saving the nhs , if i find out my parents voted against me they 're going in a home . 
  not that you said that , but that voting the opposite to the sun is a valid reason to vote that way, 
  we probably are compared to them tbf, 
  we 've been pirates since before the romans came my friend, 
  you fuckers, 
  it 's pronounced maiy-ork-a right ? 
   but tend to think of the telegraph and guardian as both being at least quite decent , i 'm left wing too , so i usually like what they write . 
  but the brexit debate made me realise that guardian lie just as much as every other fucking newspaper . 
  they 're all trash , it only took me until brexit to realise cause i 'm young so have n't been politically awake for very long . 
  know your enemy . 
  it 's the same reason i 'm on / r/europe reading through this . 
  i agree , that graph is interesting , but do n't the sun endorse conservatives as well as ukip ? 
  putting them at 66 % of the people voting for what they endorse . 
  i read lincolnshire , my bad . 
  you know that the nhs is fully-fuckin marxist right ? 
  the system we 're most proud of in the uk is marxist , and you think it 's terrifying that a marxist with a peace award is running for prime minister ? 
  do you know what marxism is ? 
  do you know what communism and socialism * actually * are ? 
  : thinking :, 
  you seem to say the most controversial things whenever you can on here , but yeah i totally agree . 
  people who can still remember ww2, 
  i really wish they would keep their noses out . 
  we seem to be too polite to them . 
  maybe we should start doing it back ? 
  hey germany , hows that rampant racism going ? 
  still not got rid of it after 100 years , losing both world wars and a world cup ? 
  still trying to unite all the white european countries too ? 
  well we were almost a planet by that standard, 
  or mr speaker right ? 
   the sun , the most popular tabloid , has a circulation of 1.6 million and of those 1.6 million , 1.6 million of them only buy it for page 3, 
   ran through a cornfield what ? 
   if you look at the covers , they do n't even take sides actually . 
  top right hand corners, 
   remember before the international media and the internet i find it weird how everyone else seems to know a lot about us , but we still know fuck all about everyone else . 
  i still do n't even know what you mainlanders are about . 
  people in the uk are usually only about 5 % continental and your blue eyes and fair hair more than likely came from the 5 % viking or the 90 % british/irish, 
  it 's * always * been high . 
  it 's complicated tbh . 
  i also live next to it and i 'm wondering if you 're joking ? 
  you 've clearly never been to skegness on holiday that 's for sure . 
  the eu did exactly that to the uk too though , only difference is that we did n't vote for them . 
  if 12 angry men is what i think it is ( are n't they american and therefore in a different system for a start ? ), 
  then i saw it in school years ago yes and does n't that end with a good ending ? 
  films are very black and white and do n't give a very true representation to life ya ` know ? 
  real life is a lot less polarised . 
  sounds like a fact lol , in a court does the guy always say they 're telling the truth while the detector thinks they 're lieing ? 
  do you understand what i 'm even saying though ? 
  i was proposing that they only be convicted all all people in the jury think he 's lieing as well as a lie detector . 
  this map made me realise how little i know about ww1, 
  of course a liar would say that lie detectors lie !, 
  you got a source ? 
  i was trying to find chance of error but ca n't find . 
  we can be better than normal countries . 
  we 're the ones who introduced courts to a lot of countries , we should continue to improve the system . 
  yeah okay , lets see if 12 people and a lie detector all think i 've done summat . 
  i do n't know why you think it 's radical , there is almost no chance someone would get wrongly imprisoned under these conditions . 
  they 're selected randomly from anyone over 18 that is able to , why would n't they be independent ? 
  this documentary highlights a really serious flaw in our law system which i fully understood even as a little boy . 
  if theres no evidence , you get away with it . 
  i think that if every fucker in the jury thinks a guy is lieing then we should put him to the lie detector to be sentenced , rather than relying on fuckin gods word that he 's telling the truth ( a god that these guys dont even believe in ) . 
  just say humans only have a 50 % chance of telling when someone is lieing - must be closer to 99 % in this guys case . 
  then that would be 0.5 ^ 12 that everyone is wrong , which is 0.024 % . 
  if we then add in a lie detector which are supposed to be 98 % correct or something right ? 
  then that would be a 0.00049 % chance that everyone including the lie detector is wrong . 
  if that is n't left wing enough for you all , then how about 12 random people and 12 lie detectors ? 
  it 'd have a lower likelihood for error than our nuclear power plants . 
  if they 're found guilty then `` god '' clearly is n't on his side and throw him in a tiny cell with no human interaction where he ca n't brainwash anyone else with his lies .

  terrorist - `` because it 's something that i ca n't answer . 
  if i answer in any way then it could ... nah what i mean ( you understand what i mean ) . 
  dude i dont agree with it at all , i 'm just telling you how it is . 
  in the uk you can say the most obvious lie in the world , even if the lie was so bad that nobody on the planet believed you , you 'd still get away with it if there was no concrete evidence .
