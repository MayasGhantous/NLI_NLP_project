  and thats exactly whats happening in this documentary . 
  interview guy - `` do you support isis ? '', 
  terrorist - `` no comment '' interview guy - `` why no comment ? '', 
  terrorist - `` because it 's something that i ca n't answer . 
  if i answer in any way then it could ... nah what i mean , so . '', 
  channel 4 is one of the biggest channels in the uk , and if you watchthe doc , the police did find them , they just couldnt convict them . 
  uk law is all about technicalities , you 're innocent until proven guiity . 
  they didnt admit they were supporting isis and there was no evidence that they were so they couldnt be prosecuted . 
  isis flags are probably technically ' a sharia law flag ' , so they get away with it . 
  they were n't preaching radical islam they were ` preaching a different kind of islam ' , so they get away with it . 
  seriously why ? 
  channel 4 are based in the uk, 
  make all preaching illegal ? 
  i like you, 
  however he did it , he did it in a way where he avoided doing anything that would get him locked up . 
  if the law changed then he would continue to do that . 
  if we caught him lieing with the question of `` are you supporting isis '' , then that would be enough to get him locked up . 
  `` nonsense '' hahaha , it 's the same mathematical system that stops our nuclear power plants from blowing up mate . 
  there 's no true electrical system to stop nuclear power plants from malfunctioning , but we still use this mathematical system to try our best to stop that from happening . 
  0.00049 % chance of error in a nuclear power plant is better than what we aim for in the uk . 
   you solution is that we should arrest people even though there is no evidence because some randomly selected people think this person did something wrong . 
  no my solution is the arrest people from what randomly selected people think and lie detectors . 
  lie detectors are good enough to work majority of the time if you read about them , we could just add more lie detectors into the mix if you 're not happy with that percentage change of error . 
  what about 12 random people and 12 lie detectors ? 
  there 's probably a higher likelihood that fake evidence is used so i do n't see what your problem is really ? 
  we make other decisions in court based off of what 12 random people think so why not this ? 
  especially when it 's being backed up by lie detectors ? 
  i 'm sure it 's much easier to fake a whatsapp conversation than it is to rig a jury and rig 12 lie detectors . 
   it 's quite scary how people like you do n't even seem to understand the most basic aspects of law . 
  it 's quite scary to me how little the majority of people trust science and understand basic maths . 
  using my method , only 1 in 200,000 people would be wrongly inprisoned . 
  how many people do we actually take to court for this kind of thing and out of those people , how many would you expect a full jury to wrongly suspect that they are lieing ? 
  normal in the british meaning of the word means that you riot when a person is oppressed , i was n't just talking about them either , i meant that everyone would be rioting edit : you read american all over mate , maybe you should just keep your nose out of our business ? 
  just so you can wise yourself up , [ here 's what happens when a black guy gets shot for no reason by the police in the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_england_riots ) also you spelt super wrong in your username, 
  c'mon then genius what would you do ? 
  do you have any idea how integrated into normal society the majority of muslims are ? 
  we 'd have riots across the entire country if we banned islam or started locking people up for being muslim . 
  if i were to say that i wanted to see a communism flag over parliament it 's not a crime , same for any ideology , it extends to sharia law or whatever . 
  what he 's doing is only illegal if he gives hate speech ( which religious speech like `` burn in hellfire '' does n't fall under ) or if they had some kind of evidence that he was supporting the terrorist groups . 
  our law needs updating , gods word is n't enough to check if people are lieing . 
  did n't make her realise that she should n't be slashing the shit out of our public services though . 
  no it is not fake , seriously are you joking ? 
  with the amount of good ordinary muslims we have , we 'd have much worse problems if we banned islam and oppressed them all , it would probably convert a few more people at the same time too . 
  because our law is fucked . 
  if there 's no evidence , you get away with it . 
  the guys never said they support radical islam or isis so in the eyes of the law , they had n't done anything wrong . 
  it 's quite clear that they * were * supporting isis , but there was no evidence so the courts can do nothing about it . 
  i do n't want to be spamming with multiple walls of text in the thread but [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fd5rm/the_jihadist_next_door/dihdxzr/ ) what i think we should do about it . 
  do n't want to be spammy in the thread but [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fd5rm/the_jihadist_next_door/dihdxzr/ ) what i think we should do . 
  make sure the cunts actually get put in jail in the first place . 
  this documentary highlights a really serious flaw in our law system which i fully understood even as a little boy . 
  if theres no evidence , you get away with it . 
  i think that if every fucker in the jury thinks a guy is lieing then we should put him to the lie detector to be sentenced , rather than relying on fuckin gods word that he 's telling the truth ( a god that these guys dont even believe in ) . 
  just say humans only have a 50 % chance of telling when someone is lieing - must be closer to 99 % in this guys case . 
  then that would be 0.5 ^ 12 that everyone is wrong , which is 0.024 % . 
  if we then add in a lie detector which are supposed to be 98 % correct or something right ? 
  then that would be a 0.00049 % chance that everyone including the lie detector is wrong . 
  if thats the case then `` god '' clearly is n't on his side and throw him in a tiny cell with no human interaction where he ca n't brainwash anyone else with his lies . 
   why is it always my fellow brits who do n't know how to use apostrophes ? 
  found out a few months ago that i 'm dyslexic . 
  that apostrophe was alright right ? 
  they didnt have spitfires though, 
  he was off duty if you read it, 
  i hope the guy managed to find a kebab shop that was still open once he managed to get away, 
  the guys that were fighting the nazi 's in the battle for britain were hungover apparently, 
  shhh, 
  keep digging your grave may, 
  we 'll see if our people want the pm, 
  the people of the uk do not want the uk to become a police state or end up like the us . 
  for people who have n't already seen it , really good eye witness account from a bloke that was following them round throwing pint glasses at them and stuff https://twitter.com/marklobel/status/871170664203419653 https://twitter.com/marklobel/status/871174073560248320, 
  i hope your friends are all safe, 
  watch four lions , it 's a black comedy but i do n't imagine it 's too far from the truth . 
  idiots , nutjobs and the brainwashed . 
  in the targeted area they * are * armed, 
  can you link to his story please ? 
  fair enough , you make a really good point . 
  how do those figures compare to number of business ' and population though ? 
  how do you avoid paying tax in the us , i 've never heard of that before ? 
  from what you 've said it does clear stuff up for me , i do n't know why the conservatives did n't defend themselves by telling me that , but it still does n't sound like the full picture . 
  edit : hang on , i thought you said 6th highest in the world . 
  6th highest in the eu is n't exactly great when we 're one of the most developed countries and have the 3rd highest population in the eu surely ? 
  it has been longer than a month now i think about it and no i had n't seen anything about him at all , last i heard about him was when he first got elected . 
  i have adhd so when i 'm trying to do work i try my hardest to keep away from stuff like reddit or i lose hours and hours . 
  i 've been trying to keep off of / r/europe inparticular , end up in long discussions a lot on here . 
  i 've googled it now yeah . 
  i only found stuff about him calling germany nazis , did n't see anything about him calling the whole of europe . 
  i 've lost interest now though , just a child acting up by the looks of it . 
  wow , i was joking aha , i did n't think you were being serious, 
  the website wo n't load for me :( how 's the rest of europe doing ? 
  bout time we had proportional representation anyway . 
  vote for a minor party to help push the opinions in a direction you want them . 
  lots of people started voting ukip and even though there was no chance of them winning , we ended up with the tories giving us a referendum for the eu . 
  ( i 'm not saying vote ukip , just trying to show how their popularity gains changed the politics of the uk even though they had no chance of winning ), 
  his economic plan is n't to borrow like crazy his plan is to raise corporation tax . 
  the uk 's is currently 17 % according to the debate last night , [ 19 % according to this source ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/corporate-tax-rate ) [ for other countries from this source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_rates ) * united states  35 % * belgium 34 % * france 33 % * pretty much * japan 32 % * germany and india 30 % * australia 29 % * italy 28 % * china , netherlands and spain 25 % * norway 24 % * denmark and sweden 22 % * finland and russia 20 % i 'm not pro-labour but not gon na sit back and watch people lie to each other about policies . 
  has boris johnson had a haircut ? 
  do people in sweden often tie their doors down ? 
  doesnt the wind slam them against the house though ? 
   you 've wanted to push for the chapters to get opened and closed faster i think that was in regards for ** everything ** that the eu does to be fair . 
   and frankly the `` let turkey join at all '' is already a major outlier among eu countries , most of which are strongly opposed to it .
