  i 'm just begging for something that is n't pop music . 
   you make as much sense as complaining about the lack of j-pop artists in a heavy metal festival . 
  it is n't a pop festival though !, 
  it 's a continentwide competition , who * actually * likes the music that 's in eurovision ? 
  for real does anybody even like pop music ? 
  edit : [ for reference this is my favourite song atm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxgza5497h0 ) . 
  if spain did some kind of take on their stereotypical classical music i would genuinely love it . 
  i just want to hear something that is n't pop music and i 'm sure other people do too . 
  [ like c'mon nnn , look how many people watch eurovision just to make fun of it . 
  the music is terribleeeeeeeeeee .

  where do you think you inherited it from ? 
  if you promise to vote for the uk you can join, 
  germany is one of the uks favourite countries in europe haha, 
  jist cringey and shit sorry . 
  if you 're gon na play rock actually play it . 
  having a full list of pop music entries and then a poppy metal parody is just as unfulfilling as a full list of pop music entries . 
  who also happen to have huge cultural ties with us, 
  so the impression i get off this subreddit is thaf brits should be guilty about the british empire 's misdeeds , most of the ones we 're talking about were over 100 years ago , so all the people who did them are long dead . 
  this also conveniently forgets all the good that the british empire did . 
  what the fuck was the rest of europe dooing while britain was doing the good stuff ? 
  but the germans are totally forgiven for the nazis and genocide , the irish are completely forgiven for all the terrorism in the british isles , and all the racism and dirty fuckin opinions that most of europe still has is forgiven also . 
  makes no fuckin sense , it 's blatantly obvious people just do n't like brits . 
  brits do n't idolise churchill , brits idolise the symbol of churchill . 
  which was standing up to fascism and stopping it , very different from the actual man . 
  `` median wealth '', 
  french and german only make 5 % of the dna of modern day brits anglo is a really annoying term to me aha , not accurate at all, 
  english people, 
  [ or like this ] ( http://gkrage.com/hearthstone-cards/slam.jpg ), 
  they missed `` did '' between `` when '' and `` the '' i think, 
  but if snow is over 0 \u00b0 it melts ? 
  so surely rain is always warmer, 
  and all the best have common law !, 
  english are descended from britons picts and gaels, 
  it was pigfucker saying one thing , nigel farage next to him saying the opposite , one of them had to be lieing !,

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_with_left-hand_traffic#/media/file:countries_driving_on_the_left_or_right.svg ) would be a lot safer keeping your dominant hand on the steering wheel at all times eh ? 
  cool map but does anyone know what year this was ? 
  it seems a little undetailed and wrong for the most part for the british isles edit : to elaborate on why i think it 's wrong . 
  ( from memory ) people settled in britain and ireland in the ice age . 
  once the ice had gone , the people remained . 
  ended up with 5 groups ? 
  a group of boat people between northern ireland and western scotland called scots . 
  rest of ireland was gaels . 
  rest of scotland was picts . 
  england and wales were britons . 
  southwest england was cornish who then made a settlement in brittany ( from cornwall to brittany ) who were bretons . 
  yeah i 'm trying to come up with an explanation or time period where this would make sense but i ca n't also if this map is as old as it looks , who the fuck travelled to all these places and took note of the racial characteristics hmmmmm ? 
  if he was just making it up then how did [ the spread of ginger hair ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2013/11/25/1385384333335/e4dd6e16-d96f-4ebf-a5c6-78fe01d49592-620x513.jpeg?w=620&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=60d7f5355358d07b5895c3122fca81ed ) not come into this map somehow ? 
  you 'd think that 'd be a pretty obvious racial characteristic to make up shit about . 
  judging from [ the map of blue eyed people ] ( http://www.apparentlyapparel.com/uploads/5/3/5/6/5356442/533478686.png ) , he did n't even bother making up shit with that !, 
  another obvious as fuck racial characteristic from `` the earliest times '', 
  i hate people who are happy on the first day of snow, 
  i think your analogy is taking it out of context really . 
  http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-eu-members-net-contributions-and-net-funding-2016-12 2011-2015 only 4 countries in the club contributed more than the eu funded them . 
  uk has already paid for itself , it 's also helped pay for poland , france ( surprisingly ) , spain , italy , belgium , greece , hungary ect . . you 're right about the main course , that is debatable . 
  * special snowflakes law, 
  yea but the us are stoopid, 
   the same could apply to brexit you 're right , i wonder how much money the uk has paid into the eu in total that it will never get back ? 
  i am joking , we agreed to pay that and we were a member at the time , so we do n't have any right to ask for it back but an exit bill ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  as democratic countries the military should only be used for defence anyway really, 
   but with the west 's influence as a whole in decline honestly , it can only go down . 
  we had the british empire running the show , then colonial europe and then the us took over , unrealistic to ever expect that to last forever . 
  beautiful, 
  i thought it was n't a political union cause david cameron kept telling me it was n't, 
  i feel the same , i do n't think it 's island mentality though . 
  i feel as emotionally far away from europe as i do america or asia , but not scots , welsh or irish . 
  i think it 's because i feel part of the same culture and feel that i am living in the same country as welsh , scots and irish , but i dont feel that way at all with the rest of europe . 
  i do n't feel any bias towards europe , so i do n't see them as better than any other continent . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eclycuj8ewk ), 
  every guy on reddit is a political and economic expert with a degree in computer science, 
   a country built from special snowflakes ? 
  do the laws of nature not apply in the uk ? 
  why are you arguein if you 're gon na be unreasonable . 
  we 're already leaving , it 's already done . 
   but i have n't heard any brexiteer argue for that so far that 's cause i 'm not a group of people . 
  i 'm an individual who thinks for myself , just like most other people who you 're trying to classify under one group . 
   so the rest is underrepresented ? 
  why not an enxit away from london then ? 
  nice idea but it would be theft . 
  for thousands of years through hundreds of shitty leaders we 've been moving our assets into london . 
  the city is england and the uk 's property unfortunately for londoners . 
  there 's a lot of changes i want , it 's no dis to the eu . 
  just brexit was a good start and it would 've probably been my only opportunity . 
  3.5 % in terms of the 28 members who get vetoes . 
  12.7 % in terms of european parliament , who arent even worth mentioning since those guys have no power . 
  i think we are underrepresented yeah . 
  our opinions and economy is too different from the rest of the eu for it to ever represent us properly unfortunately in the uk i think many regions are also underrepresented and i would lkke that to change also . 
  i want northern england , midlands and southern england to all have their own parliaments like scotland wales and ni do . 
  london arent underrepresented in the uk , theyre the only ones who are represented . 
  anyway , why be 3.5 % represented when you could be 100 % represented ? 
  3.5 % of the eu, 
  the thing i find most impressive is how fast he must have needed to be to make that . 
  how do you do it so accurately so quickly without ever being caught by the police seriously ? 
  well honestly i 've not been alive or politically aware long enough to observe the tariff argument specifically , but i 've heard it used in terms of bakeries , butchers and places like sandwich shops - so really on the local level . 
  not in my area , i also heard something along the lines of cornish pasties having to be protected by the uk gov through a mini fight with the eu , which diddd go through . 
  but cornish pasties are culturally important , it 's one of the only things cornwall still has it 's language is almost extinct already . 
  i find it silly that they had to fight for that , it should have been a simple snap of the fingers to protect them . 
  in terms of big business , my dad 's worked at thorntons since he was 17 .
