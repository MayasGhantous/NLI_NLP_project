  northern ireland voted to remain in the uk . 
  the rest of ireland voted to leave , what 's wrong with that ? 
  the people all got what they wanted , are you saying that those people who wanted to remain in the uk should have been forced to join the rest of ireland ? 
  nooo i 've never heard of that . 
  in school a lot of the time i would learn how to answer a question as i was in the exam aha , especially with things like maths . 
  now i 'm in uni i have loads of strange techniques i 've learned to help me learn , but it usually takes me a lot longer than the people who can just memorise the instructions . 
  i always used to say that i 'm a good learner but a slow learner haha . 
  edit : absolute worst subject i found for it was psychology . 
  you had to learn about theories that have been disproven and do n't even make any sense , you had to memorise the different studies , the dates , who did the study . 
  had to go through a list of different criteria and apply each of it to the study . 
  absolutely loads of keywords to remember . 
  absolutely none of the questions were reflective of the persons ability to understand/apply psychology , literally all of it was memory and ability to write essays , and most of the stuff you were writing about was bollocks or disproven or a flawed conclusion from a flawed study , making it less easy to remember ( because you ca n't logically follow the path to help you remember if you get me ? ), 
  yeah i 've noticed that sort of stuff through education for my whole life , i 've always been really intelligent , but really incapable of doing the `` grindy '' school work . 
  so it really stands out in my grades when a subject is like that . 
  i actually found out through university that i have adhd and dyslexia , so i guess that was why . 
  there 's certain modules/teachers/subjects that are really guilty for this kind of stuff . 
  i actually sat gcse science with two different exam boards , the `` hard '' one ( where you had to udnerstand and intelligently apply the content , and where the average in my class was a c ) i got all a 's and a * 's , and in the `` easy '' one ( where you had to memorise and regurgitate loads of shit , and where the average in my class was a b ) i ended up with a c overall . 
  it was n't the actual consequences , trump handed us a deal straight away, 
  but then trump comes in and hands us a trade deal within the first few weeks of his presidency, 
  local elections are n't a big deal really . 
  the only guys who bothered to push leaflets through my door were conservative and labour . 
  i knew the conservative guy and he is sound . 
  the labour guys leaflet had numbers which i 'm certain are a fuckin lie , he was offering to spend # 300m in two bulletpoints on his leaflet for an area that only included half of my town , and my town only has 15k people . 
  absolutely obvious choice in my area , regardless of how much i hate the tories . 
  i do n't think an american degree is worth much in the uk . 
  in the uk the education system forces you to become very specialised . 
  when i was 13 i stopped doing spanish , religion , geography , music , design tech , home ec , physical ed and maybe a few others ca n't remember . 
  when i was 16 i stopped doing everything except media , psychology , physics and maths . 
  when i was 18 i was only doing electrical and electronic engineering and computer science . 
  i 'm now 23 in my last year of uni and i 'm only doing certain aspects of electronic engineering . 
  they have 2.5 's in the uk too where majority of people stop ( my 2.5 before university was an extended diploma in eee ) . 
  i actually did the 2.5 twice before i went to university because i was n't happy with my choice first time round . 
  i bet that 's hella ineffective unless you 'd rather have the hardworking people at your universities over the smart people . 
  my university seems to be full of italians , they 're the main europeans i see there apart from other brits and irish . 
  we 're trapped on a rainy island together and we all hate each other, 
  why do you think cars are expensive man ? 
  out of my friendship group ( all working -  middle class ) at school only 2/8 of us did n't get a car when we were 17 ( including me , and i have and run one now i 'm 23 ) . 
  you are n't trying to buy one brand new are you ? 
  that 'd be crazy ahha ca n't you drive to the yorkshire dales when you wan na be on your own ? 
   unless you have the luxury of owing a car ( which are incredibly expensive to own/run/maintain here ) so you 're living in london ? 
  if you 're after happiness in the uk , london is the last place you 're going to find it . 
  come up north and the people are friendlier , the drinking is better , everybody has a car , it is n't anywhere near as densely populated , there are lots of places within driving distance that are just empty . 
  genuinely dude , try out a different part of the uk , you 'll like it so much more . 
  i would never ever move to london and i 'm from within a 20 minute drive of shottingham . 
  americans just have more money in general though , so having to pay for yourself while you 're on maternity leave , paying for child care and health care is n't as bad as it seems . 
  i prefer it our way but it is n't as bad as it seems for the us . 
  our maternity leave is double 2nd place though , ca n't just dish out holidays when our mothers are taking an extra 20 weeks off !, 
  ughhh , the sausage rolls clearly if you did n't even bother mentioning them !, 
  i 'm saying that a greggs sausage roll will blow your mind, 
  highest in the world according to that list on wikipedia i linked to ; j,

  [ i edited us back on ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pkernk7.png ) the uk 's statistics ; [ life expectancy = 81.06 ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=life+expectancy+uk&amp;oq=life+expectancy+uk&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3380j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) [ happiness = 6.71 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_happiness_report ) [ paid vacation = 28 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_minimum_annual_leave_by_country ) [ maternity leave = 40 ] ( http://d35brb9zkkbdsd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maternity_leave_2014.jpg ) [ time not at work = 14.83 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_time_devoted_to_leisure_and_personal_care ), 
  i bet it 's really beneficial for companies when the queens husband comes in to look around for a day edit : big fan of your username btw , not sure if i 've told you before, 
  i 'm not joking man, 
  how did the eu cause that to happen out of interest ? 
  edit : my questions a bit confused cause there is n't a monopoly on bakeries where i live , there 's still successful local places and only 2 nationwide companies as far as i know . 
  i know i 'm just curious what they actually are, 
  but the `` benefit '' is a mutually beneficial deal . 
  that is n't what a benefit is . 
  you didnt watch the video, 
  but bacon , sausage , black pudding and greggs, 
  it 's one company , trying to push their luck . 
  uk citizens have n't backed it and the uk gov has n't backed it . 
  seriously though i feel sorry for you guys cause you do n't have greggs . 
  you 're seriously missing out so bad , quality of life would zoom all across the eu i swear . 
  its not our logic is it ? 
  its just a company trying to push their luck . 
  i dont think theyre talking about a `` law '' they 'll be talking about trade tariffs right ? 
  anybody know the statistics for the uk ?

  he 's just a stay at home dad really, 
  ... that isnt technically a lie is it ? 
  cameron was high in government at the time , so what he said was relevant . 
  and boris johnsons lie did not make the eu look bad so it is also irrelevant to this thread . 
  because a good deal is hugely beneficial to both sides and the first thing the eu officially did in making a deal was create movable goal posts . 
  another lie to make the eu look better right ? 
  we have the 5th highest gdp in the world right and we 're supposed to be keeping alive through a state owned healthcare . 
  it 's bad . 
   could a vote that might as well de-stabilize the whole european union might be taken as personal you know you do n't fucking own us right ? 
  you know it is not our job or responsibility to look after you ? 
  the entire time we 've been in the eu , we 've been unhappy with it but still contributed positively and paid positively , and now that we 're leaving you ' r mad ? 
  hahah fuck you , you deserve to miss us with that attitude . 
   what you call `` teaching a lesson '' i call treating the uk as a 3rd party state , which is exactly what the uk wants you 're right , we do want that , only most of the eu right now has realised that treating us as a third party state is n't a punishment at all , so their minds have changed and they want to punish us instead . 
  the uk just wants to be independant and friends but the eu is acting like a mardy immature child over the whole thing . 
  i think economic punishments on the list too if it goes too far . 
  the strongest members of the eu are reliant on the uk . . 
  who in the uk government said what lie about the eu ? 
  gim me one example . 
  only one i can think of off of the top of my head was david cameron saying that the `` uk is not moving towards an ever closer political unification with the eu '' , but this was a lie to make the eu look better right ? 
  i personally thought that the eu was more grown up than it behaves . 
  they just seem to be acting like mardy children at every opportunity they 're given . 
  seriously how is the uk so bad on here ? 
  smoking ? 
  you 're making it sound like a mythical beast i 've never met . 
  whats british culture then ? 
  derby nottingham sheffield, 
  yes , and worms and pigs are both pink . 
  what culture are we talking about then ? 
  the more important parts of british culture have already spread all over the globe . 
  only things we need to spread further are fish n chips and shit beer right ?
