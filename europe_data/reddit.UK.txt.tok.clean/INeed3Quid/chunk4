  thanks for the fancy graph , what are the colours about ? 
  for britain 's under 28 's 9.2 % are religious , that 's wayyyy higher than i expected , i 'm wondering what % of that is for each religion . 
  i think you have to believe in magic somehow, 
  thats exactly what we 're asking for haha seeya later mate, 
  the small percent of the young , part of the small percent of the young at a good university too, 
  why are you so mad ? 
  i do n't know and i do n't care ? 
  what country are you from ? 
  that country is different to the rest of the eu , so if you do n't like it , then just fucking leave the eu there 's no need to get upset bloody hell !, 
  we left because we do n't like the way you do things . 
  we want to make our own laws about our own country , we would rather do stuff our own way , its not personal . 
  the guy did n't ask for free movement of people . 
  he just said he 'd like to `` visit and even move to other eu countries '' . 
  the uk does n't have free movement with india but 9 % of people currently living here were born in india . 
  you do n't have to have free movement to do those things , the guy was just literally asking for a healthy relationship . 
  the argument of the brexiteers was that eu workers were coming to the uk , being paid the uk 's minimum wage ( because they 're in the uk ) and taking the unskilled jobs from british people . 
  not that they were in another country doing it cheaper than we could do it hahaha . 
  anyway , i repeat , the eu is n't allowing the uk to have free trade without free movement of people . 
  the problem with trying to set up a factory in bulgaria to make cheap tacky shit , is that those bulgarians can just get on a train and work in germany for 10x the amount of money doing a similar job . 
  also good luck hiring engineers and business people to work for bananas in your bulgarian widget factory . 
  i meant he was right that we 're different , sorry i should have been clearer . 
  which benefits are you talking about ? 
  `` trade , visit , and even move to other eu countries '' `` science co-working and space exploration and the other good things that nations working together can achieve ( like the lhc ) '' these things that are good for all of us , and are frankly just part of two countries having a healthy relationship with one another ? 
  hardly fucking reaping the benefits :'), 
  the uk is not allowed free trade without free movement of people , and besides your argument works vice versa anyway . 
  honestly i did n't see anything about `` dirty/cheap european imports '' or anything like that . 
  the uk relies heavily on imports , we are n't self sufficient or anything like that , so i genuinely do n't know what you 're onabout mate . 
  i was just pointing out that having a trade deal and having a free trade deal are two completely different things . 
  free trade is good for both of us , it just means that we do n't tax each other over it being a foreign sale and therefore both get more economic growth out of it . 
  pretty irrelevant to what i was pointing out . 
  obviously we will have to follow the regulations to sell to the eu , you will also have to follow our regulations to sell to us , every country selling to every other country has to follow that country 's regulations . 
  he said that the average brit does n't understand that `` not much will change for them '' if we have a trade deal with the eu . 
  this is incorrect . 
  we would not have to do free movement of people or follow the laws of the eu if we had a trade deal with the eu . 
  it would have been correct if he had said `` if the uk remains in the eea '' or `` if the uk has a free trade deal with the eu '' however . 
  `` do n't seem to understand that if they want to have a trade deal with the eu , not much will actually change for them '' wrong . 
  correction : `` do n't seem to understand that if they want to have a ** free ** trade deal with the eu ** ( join the eea ) ** , not much will actually change for them '' apparently you 're another who does n't understand . 
  to have a trade deal with the eu we do n't have to follow the laws of the eu ( obvious one being free movement of people ) only the regulations , which is the same for selling to anywhere in the world , and will also be the same for you guys selling to us . 
  to be honest i do n't see what that has to do with what you quoted from me and daily mail do n't speak for most of us , just feel the need to say that, 
  yeah he 's right but what 's wrong with that ? 
  we are n't saying that yours is bad , just that it 's not for us . 
  he didnt say that at all . 
  and when you 're in a political union , it is to do with politics . 
  uk and eu are better off as just friends , i agree . 
  who knows , if we have a little too much to drink one day . . just saying it 's not all bad , we 're still single, 
  you 're the one who does n't understand here unless you 're just being lazy with your terminology . 
  trading with the eu , having a trade deal with the eu , and being a member of the eu economic area are 3 completely different things . 
  everyone trades with the eu , not much question about if we 're gon na carry on doing that . 
  you dont need to accept the freedom of movement ect to get a trade deal with the eu , you need to do that if you want to join the eea . 
  you have trade deals of different degrees with probably all of the world . 
  well from the figures everyones been throqing about for the last year , punishing the uk punishes the eu back , so this should n't be surprising . 
  i guess we 're actually gon na get a nice trade deal ? 
  damn i actually started to think the eu wasnt making empty threats at one point . 
  i didnt say that , the guy asked how we got here . 
  yeah about half i think , quite a lot from china too . 
  the uk 's immigration laws are actually very very strict , so people who manage to emigrate here from outside the eu are either in a profession that we need ( doctors , engineers ect ) or own a business here , or have family here , sooo they 're always bringing a lot to the table . 
  with this in mind ; when the problem of too much immigration came up , it was the eu 's fault . 
  since we ca n't say no to eu immigrants and the other immigrants are needed/have a right to be here . 
  when the problem of `` immigrants taking working class jobs '' came up ( which is complete bollocks ) it was again the eu 's fault since the immigrants from outside the eu are all doctors and small business owners . 
  when the issue of our immigration policies being too strict came up , it was the eu 's fault because we can only allow in so many people and since we are n't allowed to say no to the x amount of eu immigrants we have to say no to some of the immigrants from outside of the eu that we do need/want . 
  i 'm at university right now . 
  it 's in the top 1 % of universities in the world . 
  got a friend here doing electrical engineering , he 's probably gon na end up with a 1st . 
  if he does n't manage to find a job by october ( 4 months after we graduate ) where his employers will have to spend a shitload of money to sponsor his work visa , then he 's going to be sent back to nigeria despite the fact that a big chunk of nigeria has basically been taken over by isis , and despite the fact that he 's going to have a really good degree in an area that the uk needs more of . 
  nigeria are supposed to be our commonwealth friends and we treat their citizens like that ? 
  our immigration policy genuinely does fucking suck , it does need changing . 
  haha what you onabout ? 
  do the uk and northern ireland need the eu to give permission for this to happen ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they do since ireland basically has had its authority of this issue to be taken away from it by being in the eu . 
  correct ? 
  well i dont think the uk wanted to leave free trade , it just wanted to leave the eu . 
  it isnt quite the same though right ? 
  germany for example would have the option of either trading to ireland who would then use their free trade to trade to the uk , or trading with tariffs directly with the uk . 
  money would still be lost in ireland and on things somewhere along the line by taking the indirect route . 
  but when it comes to specifically northern ireland and ireland trading , it would just be very convenient for both sides . 
  basically it would be very beneficial to ireland and slightly beneficial for everyone else right ? 
  with free movement i guess it 's an easy loophole for people trying to sneak into the uk . 
  but ireland like the uk , is n't in the schengen area , so there is at least some checks and eu citizens who are n't irish in the uk who had not gone through the proper channels would be classed as illegal immigrants , so there 's actually a detterent there to stop them . 
  the uk currently doesnt have a problem with illegal immigrants , it 's legal ones that have sort of caused the problems . 
  by law , no , realistically , they could have , but david cameron thought that remain would win and it turned out that lots of tories were brexiters so i guess they went ahead with it because some of them wanted it and so they didnt damage the tories reputation for honesty ( ha ), 
  [ here ya'ar ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/governments-eu-leaflet-introduction/ ) tldr : they fiddled with the numbers a lot , like assumed net migration would be 0 to then help improve some of their other figures , stuff like that . 
  the whole remain campaign was very shallow to be honest . 
  they were trying to fight immigration , socereignty and economic arguements with solely economic arguements , they 'd totally lost on two fronts from the get go because there was no counterarguement . 
  their economic arguement was `` lets play it safe '' which was stupid because the average brit is fucking poor really , and leave arguement for economy was `` take a gamble '' , obviously all the people with no money to afford a house would rather take a gamble . 
  honestly the majority of remainers i 've spoken to were either people that were really shitting it over the economy , or were just completely naive to what the debate was about and just thought `` i 'm not a racist so i 'll vote remain '' . 
  i started off in that bracket , `` i like europe , i 'm not racist and i do n't care about immigration , so i 'll vote remain '' . 
  but then after listening to both sides i moved to the fence . 
  but remain were also lying too , infamously on the leaflets that they pushed through every door as an example, 
  omg thats so generous the other # 8 is for not taxing each other and all the immigrants they supply us with i take it ? 
  why not haha . 
  i was born in 1994 , i had 4 male great-grandparents alive in world war 2 . 
  1 worked in the mines , 2 were engineers that worked at rolls royce and 1 was in the army and got blown up on a bridge in france . 
  they were all dead before i was born so i did n't meet a single one of them , what do those people 's actions in world war 2 possibly have to do with me ? 
  go even further back to my ancestors from all the bad stuff in ireland , what do those people have to do with me ? 
  i ca n't even name them . 
  should i be angry at them because they didnt revolt against the monarchy ? 
  seriously , you say you do n't subscribe to that point of view , so what ? 
  do you view yourself as a monster because you 're descended from nazis ? 
  do you see me as a hero cause i 'm descended from people who helped create the spitfires that defended the uk from the nazis ? 
  it 's a completely irrational point of view to have , i really dont get it at all ?
