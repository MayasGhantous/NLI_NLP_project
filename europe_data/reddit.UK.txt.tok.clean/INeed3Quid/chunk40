  why would you think less of us for wanting a more localised government ? 
  or are you saying the publics response to brexit ? 
  have you ever been to the uk or ? 
  ahh thats cool  what did you study out of interest and how long ago was that ? 
  my year was the second year to be paying the # 9k a year aha . 
  i 've never heard about canadas health system before , should 've assumed you had one similar really haha . 
  in europe i 've only ever been uk , ireland , france , switzerland , spain , greece and turkey and only in the touristy parts so do n't know what to say about that . 
  in greece there was a lot of dead cats on the street from what i remember and in turkey the people kept making an uncomfortable fuss over my little sister for being blonde and blue , but they were nice places other than that . 
  i wan na elaborate more on the education and economic side cause my examples too good and sad i didnt think of it straight away . 
  in school i had a smart friend who was from a really poor family , his dad painted houses for a living and his mum was disabled and couldnt work . 
  they lived in a council house given to them by the government . 
  when he went to college the government started giving him # 40 a week making him better off than i was at that age aha . 
  he then went to university , did well , now has a pretty good job and has just brought a small house and moved out . 
  well i 'm a working class ( from a poor family ) 23 year old from the uk and i 'm writing this from a world top 1 % university . 
  we also have the nhs which is probably the most left wing system in the world right ? 
  yeah i do n't think we 're as left wing as canada but we try to be and i think sometimes we do manage to get there before you on a few things ( needs citation ) . 
  our right wing governments are left wing on a world standard , no doubt . 
  judging by the maps shared on this subreddit where we usually end up in the top 5 for stuff like minimum wage , attitude towards gays , quality of schooling . 
  yes . 
  not more left than finland or canada , probably on bar with netherlands and sweden from what i 've seen . 
  snoopers charter, 
  lib dems probably gon na do better than labour though right ? 
  did you ? 
   that will be tested in june ... 
  it 's hardly a fair test . 
  you ca n't blame someone if they choose not to vote for a man who single handedly tears apart his own political party . 
  if he was pm the fucking midlands would end up going independent or something judging off of what he did to labour . 
  for me personally . 
  it 's not to do with his policies , i think corbyn is an idiot for refusing to back down on his position in labour despite it causing the party to become unelectable . 
  i 'm not really sure how he did it , i think it was just by being oppositional to his fellow labour mp 's and a lot of the labour voterbase . 
  labour did not have a position in brexit officially . 
  i didnt hear anything from corbyn but the labour mps i did see were voting both ways . 
  well i think y' all idiots , green has the best policies . 
  now is the time to vote for them . 
  he 's a stubborn old man and keeps refusing to leave , even while his party crumbles around him and because of him . 
  i think it 's doubtful he will leave . 
  okay thanks !, 
  does that make it less worrying regarding le penn then ? 
  you better hope macron does n't do what the conservatives did in the uk , where they promise a frexit referendum to try and blow le penn out of the water . 
  when would the second round be ? 
  immediately with the same set of votes ? 
  sounds stupid if it is n't but i 'm imagining a voting system wherr you put the candidates in order, 
  le penn being 2nd place is bad news from what i 've seen . 
  like with trump and brexit it 's going to rally more people who are n't sure , want change and think `` it will never happen '' . 
  you should use a french flag as your flair . 
  people who want le penn and frexit on this subreddit are probably more likely to listen to you if they know you 're from france . 
  probably worse than that really . 
  le penn probably means frexit which would probably cause the eu to break down and also take down anyone stubborn enough to stay in it ( probably germany ) , and we all know what happens when germany 's failing the economic game . 
  yeah no pressure . 
  guys how does your election system work ? 
  if le penn gets the most votes does that mean she 's guaranteed to win ? 
  i think the majority of the uks democratic history has been run by the tories and we 're still very left wing compared to the world and the majority of europe . 
  i know the narrative looks bad but it really is n't , i think the uks standards are just different . 
  2nd biggest city in the uk in what looks like the poorest region of the uk based off of this map . 
  share it out london for fucks sake . 
  i like that they had the wrong coordinates for airstrikes on london for the entire war . 
  like seriously how did they not know ? 
  why do they like us ? 
  i 'm starting to feel like we 're the bad guy in a pantomine or something . 
  yeah i vote green but conservatives are n't evil like people on here like to suggest . 
  i think people have changed from remain to leave because of the response from the eu , not posters on this subreddit . 
  you 're quite clearly twisting that part . 
  i get you and i 'm not voting for may , but i think they 're hardly compatable tbh , she 's just a bit of a bitch, 
  yeah theres nobody to oppose them and its scary tbh, 
  i would agree with this prediction but i 'm hoping green can take some of labours seats too, 
  i do n't understand . 
  what did she change into ? 
  like fuckin hell though , does netherlands have no cultural influence ? 
  maybe if the people ask their dictator nicely enough he 'll set a load of them free ? 
  world tensions going up pretty fast , starting to wonder whether i should flee to ireland or something . 
  it does genuinely feel like the pieces are being moved to get ready for some kind of war . 
  russia took crimea . 
  uk leaves european federation . 
  us elects trump . 
  turkey becomes a dictatorship . 
  france on the verge of electing le penn. 
  russia 's starting to soar ahead in nuclear capability . 
  agression between us and north korea . 
  i havent been alive long enough . 
  is this how stuff always feels ? 
  when i was little i was n't aware of this kind of stuff . 
  at least you know who your friends are now . 
  the turks in germany france and netherlands also ` voted ' to leave . 
  the ones in the uk us and canada did n't . 
  do n't like us - offended do n't trust us - not offended, 
  * and the irish , maltese , cypriots and anyone else i 've forgotten,

  haha . 
  i 'm from very-near nottingham so i 'm kinda bias , but nottingham is covered in good bars , like covered . 
  it 's a bit boring for me compared to the others , because it 's home so there 's nothing new or different about it , but it is a good night out for sure . 
  honestly the majority of the uk is crazy good for drinking , out of the 5 i said , edinburgh 's probably the worst for clubs from what i saw , but edinburgh is really really cool so i would n't write it off because of that . 
  when i 've been drinking in manchester i 've only gone to mostly clubs so not sure what the bars are like , but the clubs are good . 
  liverpool was really good all round with good bars and also really cool , same goes for york . 
  liverpool was probably my favourite for drinking to be honest , discluding nottingham . 
  also just to point out , in the uk clubs cover different types of music and they all have different people in . 
  it is n't just `` club music '' is what i 'm saying . 
  there 's usually a rock music club in each city , and there 's ones for other genres , ones for old people ect . 
  for nottingham it 's [ rock city ] ( http://www.rock-city.co.uk/ ) , and they have gigs there too .
