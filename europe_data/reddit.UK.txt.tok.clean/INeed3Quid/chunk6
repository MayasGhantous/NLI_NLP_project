  whats the debate about english language ? 
  i had an irish great grandma , 9 kids or something i think, 
  id have thought it 'd be a good way to warm up in finland, 
  so not one country in europe is having enough births per woman to replace it 's own population ? 
  i did n't notice finland to be honest . 
  very strange . 
  i 'd welcome a chimpanzee if it could create an opposition to the tories, 
  how come germany and germans always seem so leftwing to me but whenever these polls come about they fair so badly . 
  is the older generation still a problem or something ? 
  my friends are in dublin today and i 'm really jealous :(, 
  just imagining nigel farage in an underground factory full of nazi-scientist-cyborgs designing anti-eu propaghanda, 
  to be fair to the scots , it being hilly isnt the biggest problem , the biggest problem is that the bits in between the hills fill with rain and form giant puddles . 
  [ mountains explain the majority of the borders tbh ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/europe_topography_map_en.png ) . 
  i think its that way in most old civilisations . 
  [ comparing this with mountains in europe is quite interesting ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/europe_topography_map_en.png ), 
  yeah i grew up in the uk . 
  with scotland having such a powerful voice and seemingly as much land as england i always assumed that their population was about the same size . 
  i think i only realised when i was reading about the origin of my surname ( which is scottish ) when i was in my teens . 
  scotlands population is only a tenth of the englands , the majority of it is mountains . 
  it 's why they do n't get their way in parliament . 
  [ its all mountains ] ( http://gepeskonyv.btk.elte.hu/adatok/anglisztika/49pint%e9r/lrsetup/uk/geography/images/uk_topo_ok.jpg ), 
  is n't english one of ireland 's official languages ? 
  i 'm pretty sure more people speak english in ireland than irish . 
  and cornwall and all the crown dependencies, 
  this is n't / r/europeanunion, 
  for serious though ca n't you tell what they 're saying ? 
  edit : seriously why downvote ? 
  i was only asking a question . 
  i 'm actually triggered, 
  there are gangs in the uk too but the difference is that it 's very hard to get guns here . 
  [ gun deaths comparison ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3492710/thumbs/o-gun-deaths-570.jpg?7 ) [ `` gun ownership in the u.k. is far lower than in the u.s. as well . 
  on average , britain has 6.5 guns per 100 people , compared to america , which has 101 guns per 100 people '' ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/06/16/gun-violence-united-kingdom-united-states/85994716/ ), 
  that one day a year where the suns out we wo n't be able to capitalise on it !, 
  does n't seem to stop you guys from shooting each other \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  over 50 % drinking strongbow on park benches by age 14. , i 'm surprised it 's that low tbh . 
  im confused why uk 's is so high on this scale ? 
  withagun, 
  it 's cause we 're full of good universities and engineering companies which is probably where the most innovation happens . 
  out of all the posts i 've seen on this subreddit , this is the one thats made me feel most patriotic . 
  i 'm in last year of uni doing electronic engineering , 3 of my grandparents were engineers . 
  i feel like i 've contributed even though i have n't yet . 
  british electronic engineer here , feelsgood, 
  you 're so nice to us !, 
  genuinely i think the reason we view ourselves as collapsing/failing is because it 's weirdly part of our culture to be pessimistic and that we set the bar way too high because of times like the industrial revolution and the british empire . 
  we have high standards, 
  what the uk did was wrong yeah , the eu is a bit of an economic warzone though so this kind of stuff probably happens often . 
  its in the eus interest to say this now because it is no longer desirable for the rest of the eu 's public to look at the uk positively . 
  i guess this is why it took them 9 years to admit what they found . 
  if the eu had not destroyed the uks steel industry then it would not have been desirable for the uk to do this . 
  play fair and people will play fair back . 
  sweden got ta bite of scotland, 
  bullshit , we make more jokes about the frogs, 
  i think saying you miss communism and saying you miss the soviet union are two completely different things . 
  you should care because if you do n't the wolves will come for you, 
  oh shit that sounds like a problem . 
  are n't they taught about the period in school ? 
  but how many quids do you get from a yen ? 
  interesting that uks looks so boring and small compared to other countries , yet uk are the ones that have taken the most serious `` populist '' decision lately . 
  that dip at christmas where all the factories are closed, 
  yes france, 
  i hope you 're joking , but if not you need to watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnu8xdbsn10&amp;app=desktop, 
  i didnt know northern ireland had different laws to the rest of the uk so i googled . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_northern_ireland whats illegal ? 
  seems that it 's the same except that gay marriage is still called civil partnership or whatever . 
  why are you scared of gays ? 
  the fuck germany ? 
  when are your elections ? 
  is it between 4 candidates ? 
  weird how the amount in the uk has gone down, 
  i 'm proud of my greatgrandparents in ww2 . 
  never met them but 2 of my grandads were engineers at rolls royce , 1 got blew up in france and the other disappeared once his wife was pregnant ( the rascal ! ) . 
  theres nothing wrong with being proud of your ancestry is there ? 
  without our ancestors none of us would be here , and their success is our inheritence so we should at least be thankful for that . 
  i think it says a lot that quite a few of the things on this list just seem to be really really bad accidents . 
  the british empire was around for a long time and people did n't know how to do stuff properly back then . 
  seriously who knows how they should 've drawn the line to divide india and pakistan cause i do n't have a clue . 
  someone should make a video explaining how that british bloke should have drawn the line to divide india and pakistan . 
  there 's got to be an experienced country divider/line drawer somewhere right ? 
  shit !, 
  he must be immune to our accents !, 
  i think the people who have been fairest to me on this subreddit are irish , even over the british . 
  all about opinions , and it 's pretty hard for people to see our point of view if they do n't live here or have never been here . 
  there is a lot . 
  til what `` fucking gurkha '' is a reference to . 
  my grandad said it once when i was little and it stuck in my head for some reason . 
  western europeans and north americans who enjoy traveling or need to travel for work . 
  i was actually really impressed because i thought the bear was the dog on the karelian link . 
  my friend used to have one and it just used to stand there barking and occasionally take a shit in the kitchen . 
  ahh cool thanks , 
  [ english dogs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:dog_breeds_originating_in_england ) i do n't know if people outside the uk are familiar with [ yorkshire terriers ] ( http://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23132_yorkshire-terrier-460x290.jpg ) but they 're ugly little arseholes . 
  i 'm looking for shaw . 
  this is tricky . . 
  kind of strange that uk is so low when [ london is the city with the most billionaires . 
  ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/12/which-city-has-the-most-billionaires-london.html ), 
  my point is , i 've heard a lot more anti-american and anti-french stuff than i 've heard anti-russian . 
  i do n't actually think i 've ever met anyone who said they did n't like russia , but you would n't say that the uk is anti-american or anti-french would you ? 
  i think he probably will to be honest , i 'd imagine he 'd lift them once we 've left the eu but yeah, 
  i do n't think we 've ever been to war against them , and i 've never heard of any grudge against them or anyone shittalk russia or russians . 
  i do n't think most brits even know a relative amount about them to be honest . 
  i know the us and then central and eastern europe are very anti-russia , but never heard anything like that from the uk .
