am i being trolled ? 
  why should i be forced to move all over my own country just to avoid them ? 
  why do you have to avoid them ? 
  why not learn how to live with them and integrate them into your society ? 
   in 2009-10 blacks were 2.7 % of the population aged 10 or above in england and wales . 
  they were 13.7 % of the prison population . 
  they received 6 % of sentences for burglary , 9 % of sentences for violence against persons , 16 % of sentences for drug offences , 19 % of sentences for robbery , and 22 % of sentences for fraud and forgery . 
  crimes committed by blacks were more severe as shown by longer sentence lengths . 
  they 're black , not foreigners . 
  i do n't know what it 's like over in the balkan states but over here in the u.k black people are just as `` british '' as me or anybody else . 
  and again , it 's not because they 're black . 
  it 's because their socio-economic status is so bad and the areas they live in are predominantly bad neighbourhoods . 
  of course they 're going to fall into bad habits . 
  why does n't the society take a bigger responsibility in improving these people 's living standards instead of just pointing a finger and going `` hah !, 
  of course they 're doing something bad , they 're black/immigrants / ( insert something ridiculous here )  the re fell because it became decadent . 
  foreign soldiers in their military serving as mercenaries , people indulged themselves in whatever pleasures they could find and ignoring dangers that were surrounding them ... nero was known as an emperor who fiddled while rome burned for a reason . 
  do you know the origin of the word vandalism ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen any historian attribute the fall of rome to one single factor . 
  i seriously doubt you 've done more research than they have . 
  also , foreign mercenaries ? 
  these people were slaves , of course they could n't care less if rome did well or not . 
  i do n't think the comparison to nero or rome is doing you any good here so please move on from this argument .

  these are all events that are caused by various things . 
  most of these events have nothing to do with racial issues . 
  you 're clearly trying to clutch at straws and even if you were right , these are just protests . 
  these protests are n't going to unravel the western world as we know it , you know that . 
   i 'm afraid you still do n't understand me . 
  i 've clearly stated that they are not my people and that i do not wish to live with them . 
  that 's just egoism . 
  of course you 're entitled to live with your own people but that does n't change because your country takes in immigrants . 
   http://www.numbeo.com/crime/gmaps_rankings_country.jsp and i quote ...  numbeo is the world 's largest database of ** user contributed data ** about cities and countries worldwide . 
  ...  numbeo is a collection of web pages containing numerical and other itemizable data about cities and countries , ** designed to enable anyone to contribute or modify content ** . 
  yeah . . great source you 've got there mate . 
   the same way the tribes from europe and north africa abused rome 's blind generosity once , which of course ended with rome getting sacked . 
  no , the roman empire fell because of completely different reasons . 
  not to mention they were different times and civilizations could be toppled much easier than now . 
   it will live for some time but if the current trend continues it wo n't in a few decades . 
  two races/cultures can not live together inthe same place , one will eventually swallow the other and eliminate it completely . 
  again , you have no factual ground to stand on whatsoever other than `` i just know it 'll happen '' even though it 's never been documented in modern times . 
   this is more proper . 
  pathological altruism is essentially a form of masochism . 
  if you 're constantly helping someone who obviously does n't respect you or appreciate you clearly there 's something wrong with you then . 
  does n't respect you ? 
  you 're talking as if these people owe us something . 
  of course they respect you but what do you want them to do ? 
  sing praise-songs and dance along to your name ? 
  they 're appreciative ( maybe not all , but that 's good enough for me ) . 
  you ca n't seriously be against helping refugees and immigrants because some of them are idiots . 
   you know there 's something wrong when balkan countries have less crime nowadays than britain , france , sweden ... ( i 'm not saying you 're definitely wrong but i 'd like to see actual numbers on this ) if what you 're saying is true ( which i highly doubt ) it could be for many reasons . 
  immigration does n't have to be the main reason and there is no actual research to prove this . 
   people segregate themselves , both native europeans and immigrants . 
  as i 've said , it 's an instinct . 
  people want to live with their own kind . 
  what a very dishonest and disingenuous thing to say . 
  it 's easy to criticize immigrants but when thousands and thousands are thrown into suburbs away from the central part of towns without any contact with the native people it 's easy to see why they 've become segregated . 
  this was not a personal choice . 
  the governments of these countries needs to take bigger responsibility in having a good integration-politic and a good plan on how to make the immigrants a part of society . 
  shoving all these different foreign cultures and people in one place is n't the right solution . 
   it will definitely make western europe peaceful and homogenous again , as it ought to be . 
  turning countries and cities into multi-racial and multi-cultural clusterfucks never ends well . 
  it is not diversity , it 's forceful assimilation . 
  i 'll answer you with the same thing again . .  again , you have no factual ground to stand on whatsoever other than `` i just know it 'll happen '' even though it 's never been documented in modern times . 
  also , `` forceful assimilation '' ? 
  this contradicts your whole point . 
  you 're saying these people have segregated themselves and yet in the same post you claim it 's forceful , implying you do n't wish to be mixed with them . 
  you refused to answer my question when i asked you how the western world would n't live on . 
  you 've reiterated this logic by saying ;  at the cost of hurting and slowly wiping your own people from existence ? 
  you can not help everyone , it 's a cold reality . 
  all you do is actually hurting these countries . 
  and i 'm not sure what your video is supposed to prove . 
  admittedly , i did n't watch the whole thing but i get the basic message . 
   there 's also a fine line between empathy and pathological altruism . 
  the latter one is dangerous and self destructive . 
  pathological altruism ? 
  i 'm not sure you know what that means . 
  altruism implies you 're helping someone else at the cost of your own well-being or helping someone without an ulterior motive . 
  that 's not what 's happening here . 
  helping immigrants and refugees does not equal a worse standard of living . 
  what equals a worse standard of living is underlying issues such as segregation , racism , alienation , ignorance and bad social-economic standards . 
  if you think shutting the doors on these people is going to help the world or your country i can tell you with absolute certainty it wo n't . 
   ergo , they 'll live on , the west wo n't if something does n't change . 
  what are you basing this on ? 
   we 've also sent a lot of supplies and donations to japan when they suffered because of the earthquake just like every other country did . 
  having priorities does not imply lack of empathy . 
  i 'm not saying this way of thinking is connected with a lack of empathy . 
  on the contrary , i think it 's a fantastic thing that your country was able to send help . 
  imagine if these people needed somewhere to go though ? 
  if you close the doors for these foreigners you are figuratively denying them help . 
  that is what i believe is a lack of caring and a lack of humanitarianism . 
  we need to be taking care of all human beings , whether they 're japanese , somalian , ukranian , syrian and so on . .  i do not support fascism and i if you wish to brand me a racist simply because i wish to live with my own people , go right ahead . 
  i would n't call you a fascist , but i consider your way of thinking being a form of nationalism and history has shown there is but a fine contrast between the two . . edit : wrong word, 
  nonsense . 
  this kind of logic only further legitimises the ideas of nationalism and racism . 
  we lived in tribals thousands of years ago and indeed , in those days it was important to be wary of outsiders and to take care of your own . 
  today we live in a globalized and multicultural world . 
  it 's foolish to accept the tribal thinking in a society and age where it 's more vital than ever to take care of eachother . 
  the very fact that you 're calling fascism and racism an instinct is disgusting to me , i 'm sorry . 
  racism is not a human instinct . 
  you can not be born with hate , it 's taught .
