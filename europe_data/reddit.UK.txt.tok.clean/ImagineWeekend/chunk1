for as long as the power to keep it free remains in scottish hands . 
  can you imagine the importance of that river into which the rhine , thames , and seine flow ? 
  in edinburgh , scotland , the tram/bus service is cheap , efficient , clean , and , best of all , publicly owned . 
  you can get anywhere you need to go using that service and if you ca n't then you can take one of the struggling-to-compete privately owned buses . 
  in most other scottish cities a private company will have a monopoly on bus services , and so you 'll probably have to re-mortgage your house if you want to go anywhere , assuming that the company even runs buses on that route , and they wo n't if its not profitable . 
  i imagine it exists to serve tea . 
  i 'm no expert though . 
  what have we done to you to deserve this :( :p, 
  what do they call a virgin in [ insert country/region/city here ] ? 
  someone who can outrun their siblings . 
  compared to anything else ... yeah , its really bad . 
  it does n't actually taste of anything . 
  but its cheap , and people get used to the taste over time , and people do n't like to try new things . 
  ** scotland ** when you get on a bus ** do n't ** strike up a conversation with the driver about his route , other people have places to be and there are lots of handy publications , both online and physical copies , with all this information . 
  ** do ** have your fare ready . 
  when on the bus ** do n't ** talk to your friends in an overly loud manner . 
  tip on volume : if people can here you on the opposite end of the bus , you 're way too loud . 
  ** do n't ** talk to strangers , unless they initiate , of course ... but they probably wo n't initiate . 
  when walking down the street ** do n't ** zig-zag or dawdle . 
  it irritates people to no end . 
  stay on the left if you want to window-shop . 
  if there is little or no traffic ** do n't ** bother pressing the button and waiting for the lights . 
  just cross the bloody road , everyone else does ( though this varies depending on the city ) . 
  tip if you want to , but its not expected . 
  if you watch a street performed during the edinburgh festival period , it 's the decent thing to give them some money . 
  ** do n't ** talk politics or religion . 
  ** do n't ** call us english . 
  ** do ** compliment our accents :p . ** do n't ** drink the `` national '' beer , tenants . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  seriously , ** never ** drink it , it tastes like urine and smells worse . 
  you 'll know it because you 'll see the red letter `` t '' everywhere that sells alcohol ( bartender uniforms , taps , pint glasses , coasters , chairs , random decorations on the bar , etc ) . 
  drink one of the local craft beers or something . 
  ` bullshit ' , i think is the technical term . 
  i always wanted to drive it , that way i could take my time and see as many sights as i wish . 
  just me and some friends and a few phrase books would be awesome . 
  i 'd never considered hitch-hiking before , but that sounds like a great idea , you could really get to know people and make some friends along the way . 
  that 's on my bucket list . 
  we get it , the soviets were pretty bad . 
  iran is also a democracy . 
  auschwitz is in poland, 
  he mentioned wildlife / s, 
  whoops . 
  i should have spotted the troll earlier . 
  oh well , i guess i 'll just paste it into a document and use it when the next one comes along . 
  fascist . 
  cuba is so much more than your standard banana republic . 
  cuba has a democratic elections . 
  `` single party state ! '', 
  i can hear you cry already . 
  yes , this is true , but i did n't say it was a liberal democracy . 
  the communist party does n't put forth candidates , all candidates are nominated by the constituency , from the constituency , and a lot of these people are independents . 
  sure , the executive is the same guy and has been for a long time . 
  nobody voted for him , etc , etc. 
  but considering the turnout in western countries , and considering the state of the island , i 'm going to say that the castros have been great for cuba , better than batista , better than any us president ever was . 
  cuba has a 99 % literacy rate ( highest in the world ) ; free , high quality , universal healthcare - probably the best in the western hemisphere ( perhaps coming second to canada ) which also includes gender reassignment and cutting edge bio tech industries ; free , universal , high quality education , which also goes to thousands of international students ; racism and sexism are quickly becoming things of the past , as they should be , and at a much better rate than in the western world ; poverty , while in existence , is being stamped out . 
  cuba has the most humane foreign policy in the world . 
  it sent hundreds of doctors to tackle ebola , compared to the world 's superpower 's paltry sum , it has 55,000 doctors and nurses working across the developing world , when haiti suffered its earthquake , cuba sent massive and immediate aid . 
  compare this to russia , the us , or the uk , these countries send bombs and exploitative corporations abroad , not doctors . 
  capitalism caused the mass murders in the belgian congo , irish potato famine , bengal famine , trail of tears , slave trade , cia murders . 
  the fact that we have the capacity to feed the world , yet people starve is capitalism 's fault . 
  ever hear of the british empire ? 
  capitalism . 
  any and every colonial empire ? 
  capitalism . 
  the dutch ran their colonies like companies , where the inhabitants were squeezed for every penny . 
  r\u00e9gimes have been toppled for daring to not kow-tow to the us ' corporate agenda ( see : allende in chile , where the puppet us backed dictator , pinochet , enjoyed throwing dissidents from helicopters , amongst other niceties ) . 
  the us has funnelled weapons to various insurrectionary groups and these actions came back to haunt them with 9/11 ( which the american state absolutely deserved ( not the people mind you , just the state ) ) . 
  this goes beyond state actions too . 
  nestl\u00e9 is just one example of a horrific corporation , they literally starve babies to death - they give free formula milk to new mothers as a one off , the mothers use it and stop lactating , so they 're forced to buy the milk , yet they ca n't afford it and have to use filthy water . 
  the result is dead and sick babies . 
  that 's beside their water issue . 
  corporations assassinate trade unionists in latin america , etc. 
  beyond state and corporate atrocities , there is also the issue of alienation and the destruction of the fabric of society , the constant , unceasing cycle of boom and bust , and the rampant , unceasing disregard for the planet . 
  capitalism comes second in terms of malice only to the nazis . 
  yet it also far exceeds the nazi 's body count . 
  it 's entire raison d'\u00eatre is the oppression and exploitation of others . 
  supporters of the system are either ignorant , narrow-minded , or malicious cunts . 
  either way , many of the elected syriza members are cowards . 
  they were also elected to remain within the eu . 
  it 's sort of a clash . 
  i ca n't pretend to know what was going through tsirpas ' mind , but i expect this choice between the two options was why varoufakis resigned and rode off into the sunset . 
  without funds , there was little else to be done the rest of the world wo n't help . 
  i believe that much of syriza was simply too demoralised and too broken to do anything else . 
  they were forced to bend over and hope that lube was to be used . 
  they ignored their electorate because that 's always what happens in liberal `` democracies . '', 
  that does n't make their choice the right choice or even a good choice or even the least bad choice . 
  these countries get these high standards of living for a portion of their population by oppressing everyone at the bottom . 
  freedom from regulation is connected to starvation , privation , suicide , and the degradation of human mental health . 
  capitalism promotes greed , avarice , and malice . 
  syriza just voted to implement austerity . 
  this idea has been implemented very few times . 
  and where it has , the capitalists and authoritarians have always come in to crush the movement . 
   capitalism , human progress and reduction of human misery goes hand in hand . 
  hahahahahahahaha !, 
  you 're serious ? 
  i see . 
  i hope you meet somebody who is inclined to cure you of those opinions soon , comrade . 
  maybe one day you 'll see the value in liberty and equality . 
  austerity leads to an increase human suffering . 
  that 's not functional , in my books .
