lies !, 
  they stole it from a bunch of dead norwegians !, 
   * dairy farmers oppose a long-standing proposal to extend the shelf life of milk to 10 days , as is common elsewhere in europe . 
  *  * this could be done relatively simply in the pasteurisation process , but skordas said cattle breeders feared - unnecessarily , in his opinion - that this would open the door to increased competition from imported milk . 
  * that must make a massive difference to the cost of distribution and losses due to waste . 
  that and there 's a lot of snobbery about taking coaches . 
  inter-city travel in the uk is cheap if you 're willing to go by coach at the less desirable times of day . 
  it just depends how much you value your time/convenience . 
  usually the swipe is to get into research areas or for out of working hours access . 
  sports and library facilities are available to the public with an id . 
  unfortunately at our university there have been a lot of thefts . 
   `` of the 70 billion euros we pay in taxes to rome , we get back about 50 billion euros , directly and indirectly . 
  we are losing out on ** 20 billion euros a year ** -- that 's a lot of money for five million people , '' said professor pizzati . 
  the total construction cost of the mose project ( which i assume you are referring to ) seems to be around $ 6 billion , with an annual mainatainence cost of around $ 8 million . 
  i 'm not italian , so it 's none of my business , but i thought i should point this out . 
  well , this is interesting . 
  the erasmus budget for the academic year 2010 and 2011 is this :  [ in 2010-11 the total budget was around $ 460 million , of which $ 435 million was dedicated to support for mobility . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/pressreleasesaction.do?reference=memo/12/310 ) in comparison to an above inflation increasing annual eu budget :  [ the overall budget for next year will amount to eur 129.1 billion ( 1.86 % increase ) in payments and eur 147.2 billion ( +3.8 % ) in commitments . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/2012/2012_en.cfm ) however , as the article linked to by the op says :  * french conservative member of the european parliament , alain lamassoure , who heads the budget committee , said that `` the european social fund is bankrupt and ca n't refund member states . 
  *  * `` next week it will be erasmus , the student programme , at the end of the month , the research and innovation fund . 
  '' * which makes the part toward the end of the article where britain is denounced for trying to put the brakes on the budget rises  * britain , which led efforts to trim the 2012 eu budget , was shooting itself in the foot , he added , denouncing what he termed `` an absurd situation . 
  '' * sound a little bit cheeky to me . 
  personally i am not sure about erasmus , i can see what it is trying to do to increase the mobility of labour in the eu , and at least there are more than a handful of people benefiting from it . 
  however , in my opinion , for those deciding the eu budget to decide that the response to not getting a budget increase is to completely wipe out a relatively popular ( by eu standards ) 25 year old program , they do appear to be making a somewhat poor decision of what to cut . 
   do its supporters believe other ethnicities besides their own are to blame for the current crisis ? 
   do its supporters believe kicking other ethnicities besides their own out of europe will help solve the crisis in a meaningful way with a constructive outcome ? 
  one of the issues is that unemployment is very high in many countries ( and within those countries , in certain regions it is much worse than others ) , and that the welfare programs to support those who are out of work and undergoing economic hardship are being stretched by the large increase in those needing its support . 
  it is a natural `` us '' and `` them '' response to feel you need to protect `` our '' jobs and `` our '' welfare system '' from the mostly poor , recent migrants ( that compete for jobs and welfare ) who appear very different to `` us '' , and therefore you do not identify with them . 
  add in news sensationalism about the crimes commited by immigrants , and it is very easy for someone who ; ca n't get a job , is being excluded from stricter limits on welfare support , and knows ( or is ) a victim of a crime that is blamed on immigrants , to resent immigrants and wish for them to be removed  do its supporters believe only enslavement and/or killing of other ethnicities besides their own will achieve this ethnic agenda ? 
  in almost all cases it is a matter of ; expulsion of migrants/asylum seekers , strict border control or legislating integration . 
  i 'm sure there are people within the xenophobic political groups who believe in using violence , but i must stress in most places it is not an openly expressed opinion . 
  i live in south-east england , so i 'm not exactly in a position to comment from first-hand experience , however . 
  let keep the metaphor in badly-poured-pint/half-litre territory . 
  that is too far for my liking ... 
  it seems to be all head , and no beer , still pretty appropriate, 
  and they did manage to fit in a `` wind in the willows '' reference on the overflight of the thames near the start . 
  cartoon mole and rat in a boat superimposed on the river , was very brief though . 
   so you say that my example is weak . 
  somehow , i do n't think that cameron wanting to `` renegotiate terms '' of eu membership and using the weight of tory dominance in the uk to influence a `` popular vote '' in the uk is politically neutral language -- at all . 
  if/when to have an eu referendum and what the question ( s ) will be , is a major upcoming political issue in the uk . 
  if anything , that part of the article is n't about the writers opinion of the weakness of the eu ; it is about the divided nature of the uk parties , and the hole they 've dug themselves by trying to buy off the eurosceptic parts of their parties ( and the public ) with vague promises of a referendum . 
  for the most dogmatically eurosceptic conservatives , the biggest issue of the eu has always been one of sovereignty , not economic reasons . 
  i 'm not sure how it works in other european countries , but in the uk it 's done by a regional party list system . 
  you ca n't vote on candidates . 
  only thing you can do in that situation is let their political party know that there are a lot of people willing to change their vote due to their meps decision , and hope he gets bumped down/off the list . 
  ah , so west wales would be a bit difficult to fit into that , which is a pity , because the landscape is utterly beautiful ( shite weather though ) . 
  i 'll still [ recommend bristol ] ( http://visitbristol.co.uk/ ) for its good transport links ( rail and coach network hub ) and a good mix of historical/natural features with the contemporary arts . 
  although thats only if you go south anti-clockwise to liverpool . 
  oxford is admittedly a stereotypical tourist place to go , but it 's beautiful , and as a major university city , it caters to entertaining those in their early 20s pretty well . 
  if you are n't going to see the pembrokeshire coast , there are plenty of [ other national parks ] ( http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/ ) worth looking at . 
  i know the uk does n't have landscapes on the scale of north america , but its still beautiful in my opinion . 
  i guess this is one to leave down to what the weather is like . 
  the past few septembers have been quite warm and dry here , so maybe it 'll be great . 
  another stereotypical tourist one ( so maybe not for you ) is [ kew botanical gardens ] ( http://www.kew.org/ ) since schools will have started , i 'd say that week-days they should n't be too busy ( getting in on a sunny weekend is a nightmare ) . 
  i 've been there in spring/early summer before , so i 'm not sure what they have in september , but it may be worth a look . 
  how are you getting to ireland ? 
  if you 're going by ferry from wales i can suggest taking a ( cheap ) coach from london to bristol , checking out bristol ( a lot of good stuff there , you should also be at a good time for cider , maybe a bit too early ) , then on to wales and pembrokeshire coast national park is a beautiful place to visit ( also near where you can get a ferry , i believe ) . 
  the armenian genocide can be brushed under the rug pretty easily . 
  cyprus however ... 
  i do try and stand up for irish/scots who get trouble in shops , though they usually stand up for themselves , it must be said . 
  you can usually guilt shop staff by pointing out it 's called the `` british pound '' , not the `` english pound '', 
  the whole paragraph  to begin with , past virtue counts for little at the moment : if the euro collapses , then germany will suffer hugely . 
  the downgrading of some of its banks this week was a portent of that . 
  moreover , the undoubted mistakes in greece , ireland , portugal , italy , spain and the other debtor countries have been compounded over the past three years by errors in europe 's creditor countries . 
  the overwhelming focus on austerity ; the succession of half-baked rescue plans ; the refusal to lay out a clear path for the fiscal and banking integration that is needed for the single currency to survive : these too are reasons why the euro is so close to catastrophe . 
  and since germany has largely determined this response , ** most of the blame belongs in berlin ** . 
  that is ; the blame for the focus on austerity and weak rescues without considering other options , which means that we are as near as we are to a euro-zone disaster , belongs in berlin . 
  pretty misleading headline there . 
   but the funds came at a high cost , with the 10-year bonds fetching more than six per cent - a rate widely regarded as unsustainable for the state over the longer term . 
  this is mixed news , not good news . 
  i guess at least spain has more time . 
  this is n't a historical one , and i 'm not sure if it 's already been posted , but i found this contemporary-fictional [ ww i map ] ( http://www.keiththompsonart.com/pages/grandmap.html ) and its reasoning quite interesting . 
  which context is this in ? 
  there are plenty of issues which there are disagreements on . 
  long term disagreements on the speed and limits of eu expansion and integration ( `` depth '' and `` width '' ) ? 
  the differences between the mostly wealthier northern european members , and the disparagingly termed `` pigs '' ( portugal , italy , greece and spain ) ? 
  or the newer , eastern , former-soviet countries . 
  the more recent disagreement between eu members about how to approach the sovereign debt crisis ? 
  drugs companies will be wary selling to a country in a free trade area at a significantly lower price than they sell in the rest of that area . 
  in 2010 when the pound fell against the euro ( to a lower degree than the drachma would inevitably after a greek exit ) , we had problems with drugs bought for the nhs being resold in europe for a higher price . 
  reported in [ the guardian ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/feb/10/nhs-drugs-shortage-europe-sales ) and [ the telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7274646/one-in-10-pharmacies-illicitly-selling-nhs-drugs-abroad.html ) drugs companies might be able to work out assurances that this wo n't happen , but that might take several months to put in place . 
  several months is a long time for a patient with a serious illness . 
  there will always be regional sporting competitions . 
  in the uk there are the different national teams for most sports ( explicitly referred to as such in the name of `` six nations '' rugby ) , there is even the [ county cricket ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/county_cricket ) . 
  however , i guess there is `` team gb '' for the olympics . 
  so my prediction might be continued national sports teams , but a collaboration for olympics teams at some point in the distant future . 
  [ his later life section is pretty grim reading ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mathias_rust#later_life ) however this bit made me snicker . 
   in 2009 rust described himself as a professional poker player . 
  most recently , in 2012 , he describes himself as an analyst at a zurich based investment bank . 
   in the case of strong and unexpected migratory pressure , ** or ** the failure of a state to protect the external borders of the eu . 
  grammatically the `` or '' is the key part . 
  surely the same way half of western europe did after the enlargement , [ or france did when it stopped the tunisians coming in on the train via italy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area#controversies ) . 
   at the request of france , in may 2011 the european commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstr\u00f6m proposed that more latitude would be available for the temporary re-establishment of border control in the case of strong and unexpected migratory pressure , or the failure of a state to protect the external borders of the eu . 
  if france can get away with it , why not the uk ? 
  mind you , i suppose france getting an exception is what led to the euro sovereign debt crisis in the first place ... ooooooh controversial ( i jest ) . 
  maybe not , remember [ the uk is n't part of the schengen area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area#eu_member_states_with_opt-outs ) . 
  my issue is , yes it 's fair enough to have a plan ready , but do n't publicise it . 
  falling economic confidence is self-fulfilling . 
  i was replying to point out that scotland should take a proportion of the debt , as the attitude that it was run up by westminster so westminster should keep it is not completely accurate . 
  an independent scotland could levy its own taxes and issue its own bonds , absolutely , but that 's not what i was arguing against .
