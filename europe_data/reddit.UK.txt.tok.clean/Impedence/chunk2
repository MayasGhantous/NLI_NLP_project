  [ this is the scottish governments report on scottish revenue and expenditure ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/2012/03/9525 ) the executive summary has this :  in 2010-11 , total public sector expenditure for the benefit of scotland by the uk government , scottish government and all other tiers of the public sector , plus a per capita share of debt interest payments , was ** # 63.8 billion ** . 
  this is equivalent to 9.3 per cent of total uk public sector expenditure . 
   in 2010-11 , total scottish non-north sea public sector revenue was estimated at # 45.2 billion , ( 8.3 per cent of total uk non-north sea revenue ) . 
  including a per capita share of north sea revenue , total scottish public sector revenue was estimated at # 45.9 billion ( 8.3 per cent of uk total public sector revenue ) . 
  when an illustrative geographical share of north sea revenue is included , total scottish public sector revenue was estimated at ** # 53.1 billion ** ( 9.6 per cent of uk total public sector revenue ) . 
  the uk spends more on scotland ( or on its behalf ) than scotland generates in government revenue ( including its full geographical share of oil wealth ) , by scotlands own figures . 
  it puts scotlands share of the deficit at # 6.4 billion for 2010-2011 , which is proportionally smaller than the rest of the uk , but not by a massive amount . 
  the oil revenues are n't a magic bullet . 
  ^ english it 's not up to me , it 's up to the opinion of a majority of the scottish people ( though , whether a majority of voters is needed , or a minimum amount of the electorate , like 1979 , this time will be debated hotly ) . 
  personally , i would rather there was just increased devolution . 
  seperating the debts ( not just sovereign debt , but the bailed out bank of scotland liabilities ) , the nuclear deterrent ( based in scotland ) , the military ( scotland will want bits of it , and future naval contracts ) and the public sector in general would be an absolute nightmare of bitter recriminations . 
  edit : oh and the other big argument will be the maritime border . 
  scottish nationalists believe that the 1999 change to make the maritime border perpendicular along the coast instead of on the 55 degrees line of latitude ( as was decided in the 60s ) was a plot to rob them of fishing and oil in the event of independence . 
  that one might get nasty too . 
  my point was you should n't blame the greek cypriots for being in a situation where there are foreign bases there . 
   there is the british base and apparently soon a israeli too . 
  go and give your soverignity away . 
  why not let . . let 's say another foreign country have a base there too ? 
  i feel i should point out that the uk bases on cyprus are a result of a [ deal the uk made with the ottoman empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_cyprus#1849-1878 ) to oppose russian expansion . 
  the cypriots had no say in it . 
  the weird thing is , the reason turkey invaded was the concern that cyprus was going to be integrated with greece . 
  by their own standards , they should celebrate cyprus acting as its own state in international affairs . 
  the trouble is , since the ethnic cleansing of the second turkish invasion , and subsequent settlers brought over from the turkish mainland , the north is something like 99 % turkish . 
  ignoring the fact that turkey is a reasonably militarily powerful country and a member of nato . 
  if you `` took back '' northern cyprus , it would be impossible to reintegrate the two parts , without massive deportation of mainland turks . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  it 's not just the risk of relocation , it 's about attracting financial services business as the bric economies grow , and the eu 's share of the global economy shrinks proportionally . 
  the uk has a massive trade deficit , and trade ( including in financial services ) outside the eu is an important part of reducing that [ trade balance non-eu ] ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/noneuoverseastrade/pages/noneuots.aspx ) [ trade balance eu ] ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/euoverseastrade/pages/euots.aspx ) the loss of business , loss of future industry growth and the increase in money flowing out of the country are big problems with the proposed ftt . 
  the financial sector already contributes over # 63 bn ( $ 75 bn ) in taxes and 1 million jobs in the uk . 
  the financial sector also has a # 40 bn trade surplus , one of the few areas of the uk economy . 
  you can surely see why endangering that is a bad idea for the uk ( [ source ] ( http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/corporation/lgnl_services/business/business_support_and_advice/economic_information_and_analysis/research+and+statistics+faq.htm ) ) . 
  i updated my post with the calculation that the uk will be paying in $ 20 billion extra a year , even if we keep most of the rebate . 
  considering the uks net contribution at the moment is $ 3.5 billion , that is quite an increase . 
  edit : [ a quick search also turned out someone elses calculations on the subject , which were broadly similar ] ( http://fullfact.org/factchecks/eu_treaty_veto_financial_transactions_tax-3185 ), 
  the us financial sector spends large amounts on candidates and lobbyists for both sides . 
  it 's not a matter of which party is in power . 
  london is attempting to maintain global market share , for example by moving into [ yuan denominated financial transactions ] ( http://online.wsj.com/article/bt-co-20120418-702036.html ) . 
  it 's one thing trying to avoid losing eu business overseas , it 's another trying to attract it from abroad . 
  i meant to put secondly when i explained that the eu does already effectively levy harmonised taxes on imports . 
  i chose the explanation there because that was something under active discussion in parliament , but if you want something from the european commission , [ here is their march press release ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=5836&amp;lang=en ) as you can see , the european commission proposes that the eu takes 2/3 of the tax . 
  they claim $ 57 bn total revenue from the tax , of which the eu takes 2/3 ( $ 38 bn ) . 
  the uk is estimated to end up contributing 72 % to the tax , so that is $ 27 bn the uk gives from this tax to the eu , they would reduce $ 7.7 bn from the uk 's eu contribution by other means , however , it is likely that the rebate ( currently around $ 3.2 bn ) would be changed . 
  that looks like an additional $ 20 bn from the uk economy to the eu every year . 
   the only reason some want it to be a european-wide taxation is to avoid having everyone going to trade to the untaxed place ( and they hope/believe that the eu is too big to be avoided ( especially if the us join ) ) . 
  the usa dislikes wealth taxes , and withdrew from the kyoto agreement on the basis of loss of competitiveness to the far east . 
  i ** really ** doubt they will join , and even if they did , it would be hong kong , singapore , and zurich that the business would go to , instead of new york . 
  that 's a terrible argument . 
   but nobody said anything about giving this money to the eu ( you know they ca n't levy taxes , right ) firstly , there are plenty of people who would like to use this money on an eu level , for example the mep [ anni podimata ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/39317/anni_podimata.html ) certainly does , whose report on a ftt is being voted on in the european parliament soon ( [ the amended report is here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=report&amp;reference=a7-2012-0154&amp;language=en ) ) in [ an interview ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/content/20120521sto45442/html/financial-transaction-tax-discouraging-risky-financial-speculation ) with the europarl news she even says at the end :  * the potential of the tax as en eu own resource is impressive . 
  the commission has calculated that should two thirds of the financial transaction tax revenue be managed at eu level , the national contributions based on gross national income could be reduced by up to 50 % . 
  * that sounds a lot like giving the money to the eu . 
  oh , and no the eu does n't levy tax directly , but they do make member states levy taxes on their behalf . 
  under the [ traditional own resources ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/budg_system/financing/fin_en.cfm ) section you see that the eu delegates the collection of its import taxes to the member states . 
  just because the cheques are made out to the nation state , does n't make it not an eu tax . 
  if there is one thing in europe that is too big to be allowed to fail , it is the euro , what can be done , must be done . 
  however , i am a little sceptical of how buyers will respond to euro-bonds . 
  how cheap the rate on them will be , will be linked to how stable investors feel a fiscal union is . 
  for the euro-zone at the moment , that would mean a significant premium being paid , especially for germany with the 0 % yields it 's getting at the moment . 
  what exactly is the end of punishment ? 
  if the debt swap goes through , massively reducing the amount of debt the greek government has , and how much it has to pay to maintain it , will that be the end of punishment ? 
  how would the rest of europe end punishing greece ? 
  you really are n't making it clear . 
  that is interesting . 
  if a full debt swap happens , and tax evasion is reduced , greece could pull it off . 
  to be fair to ireland , it was n't sovereign debt accumulated by an irresponsible government , it was bailing out their banks when the property values sunk . 
  ireland 's sovereign debt to gdp ratio was under 30 % in 2008 ( [ bottom graph ] ( http://www.esri.ie/irish_economy/ ) ) , it 's just the government committed to bailing out the irresponsible banks too hastily . 
  the level of personal and commercial debt was crazy-bad though . 
  while i am broadly supportive of the greek debt restructuring , ( despite the injustice to other indebted nations ) , the fact still remains , greece has been running a growing structural deficit for a long time , even in the `` good '' years , and now its economy has shrunk , exacerbating the problem . 
  no , i do n't believe that this gap should be closed purely by tax rises and budget cuts , but with the low investor confidence ( causing capital flight ) , and the degree to which greece 's economy is linked to the sub-par performance of the rest of europe , expecting greece to grow its way out of its scary debt/gdp ratio is at least as fanciful as greece spending more within its means, 
  i disagree with that on two points . 
  firstly , there is already large tax-based transfers of wealth within the eu . 
  greece is already one of the largest net recipients of eu money both per capita and in absolute terms , and has been pretty much since it joined . 
  what is being asked of here , are large open-ended commitments to guarantee a countries debt . 
  if a friend of mine asked me to mortgage my house to help him with serious financial problems , it would be reasonable to get some commitment from them first . 
  this is n't a simple case of the rich north pulling up the drawbridge , even germany is running a budget deficit at the moment . 
  the uk and france have an even bigger one . 
  when in domestic politics you are trying to mediate between those saying we should raise taxes and cut spending to reduce your deficit , and those who say you should borrow large amounts of money to grow your economy , it does sound like the worst of both worlds to be asked to borrow large amounts of money to give to someone else . 
  what does the end of punishment mean ? 
  punishment is innaccurate . 
  what has happened is that the markets will no longer buy greek debt , and greece is currently running a budget deficit of nearly 10 % , while it had increased its structural deficit after joining the euro . 
  it is not unreasonable to want an end to a structural deficit as a condition to step in and start systematically lending money , otherwise you are postponing the inevitable . 
  i disagree on two points with an eu only ftt : firstly , i do not see why the unilateral introduction of such a tax will be any different to what [ happened to sweden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_financial_transaction_tax ) . 
  the revenues were vastly lower than predicted due to a massive reduction in transactions , avoidance , and an exodus of the financial sector to more tax-friendly locations . 
  the long term beneficiaries of a unilateral eu ftt are new york , hong kong and zurich , which will attract business from london and edinburgh . 
  the harmful derivative trading does exactly the same damage if it happens in new york as it does when it happens in london . 
  secondly , of course this has wide support in europe , because the tax will mainly be raised in the uk . 
  [ it is estimated that 75 % of eu financial transactions occur in london ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/europe/newsid_9721000/9721462.stm ) . 
  over 10 % of uk taxes are raised from the financial sector ( even more before 2008 ) , and it employs over a million people . 
  considering the uk is in recession , it is crass of the european commission to average their estimates of medium term economic damage over the entire eu , and claim that that makes its impact negligible . 
  this assessment is by the european commission itself , so i would n't be surprised if it was a little overly optimistic ( like the comically optimistic growth forecasts from the supposedly relatively independent bank of england we 've had over the past few years ) . 
  those most in favour of it are those with the least to lose . 
  what is especially true of young people in the smaller , northern , countries ; norway , sweden , finland , denmark , iceland and the netherlands , is that there is so much anglophone tv , music , books and games ( online particularly ) , they end up inadvertently practicing it outside the classroom a lot . 
  the other major european countries ; france , italy , spain and germany have a lot more of their own high-quality entertainment output , or at least get things translated into their languages a lot more ( because their language is quite widely spoken , worldwide spanish speakers compared to norwegian , for example ) . 
  by my perception though , of the other large european countries , the germans tend to have remarkably good english ( i feel more to do with their internationalist oriented education system than apparent linguistic similarities ) . 
  david mitchell iirc though i believe that was read off the autocue . 
  ... which is great news , good for them , lucky lucky old germans , could n't have happened to a nicer country, 
  indeed , i 'll admit i was a little blunt , but reflex downvotes do n't help . 
  the [ euro convergence criteria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maastricht_criteria ) and the [ stability and growth pact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact ) were introduced in recognition of the risks of monetary union without fiscal union , but then they were ignored . 
  the only possible explanation it was expanded so rapidly , to such unsuitable countries so quickly ( instead of being limited to the old ecsc countries ) , is integration based on ideology , rather than realism . 
  if one did n't exist , the other would be sidelined and ridiculed . 
  as things are , the existence of salafists preaching the islamisation of europe makes anti-immigrant/islam groups seem less crazy and more rational than they would otherwise be , increasing their sympathisers .
