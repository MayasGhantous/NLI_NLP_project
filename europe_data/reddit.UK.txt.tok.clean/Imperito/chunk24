  we settled people in africa , as did everyone , including the dutch for example in south africa . 
  there was never an organised genocide really , people died in every colony owned by anyone back then australians were still aussies when they discriminated aboriginals . 
  anyway , we were far better colonial masters than many other nations . 
  belgium in the congo for example . 
  when you do n't understand what it really means , waterboarding in guantanamo bay sounds fun . 
  australia . 
  back in the good old days we just sent em all there . 
  who cares how many they shut if they 're extremist ? 
  i 'm not saying he was a good ruler , but i do n't think he and his family deserved to be shot . 
  disgusting what happened to nicholas ii and his family, 
  we did n't exterminate them all . 
  95 % of native americans were dead when the french and english touched north american soil . 
  do n't forget , you held land in n.america , and that land is mostly european occupied now . 
  in africa , we did n't exterminate them , or india . 
  in fact the only ones you might have a point about is australia , but even then the aussies did most of that themselves . 
  that does n't disprove what i said though , she is more related to him than me , and most people - obviously there are living people that are more directly related than her . 
  heathens the lot of them . 
  no but she is his x22 great granddaughter , it 's more direct . 
  i do n't think government organisations would lie about things so traceable . 
  shes more related to him than most . 
  of course there is living descendent 's of previous kings and queens of other houses , such as richard iii . 
  i always found it a pain in the arse to learn german with their der , die and das, 
  it 's not really rip though , there 's 5 nations classed as anglo-saxon nations , and you 're one of them . 
  yeah french and germanic do make up a similar number though . 
  fucking normans , 1066 was a bad year - williams great granddaughter ( x22 ) is sitting on the british throne , that bastards ( quite literally a bastard ) line is hard to shake . 
  but hey , at least we do n't have gendered language . 
  true , but it does make me somewhat proud that we have given birth to multiple stable democracies , especially the english speaking ones . 
  an anglo empire !, 
  i fart in your general direction !, 
  your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries !, 
  god i hate this . 
  nothing makes me more angry . 
  other than people who put milk in tea before the water . 
  make english old again !, 
  i 'm talking about turkey haha . 
  he called him the kim jong un of europe . 
  which is hard when you 're in asia . 
  id hate to think what english hell looks like . 
  i 'm thinking you 're sat on a bus and forced to talk to people in it , all the while someone is sad behind you tutting . 
  german hell is probably being forced to sit through a comedy or a `` history of the 20th century '' documentary . 
  swiss hell probably contains swiss army knives that never have the tool you need on . 
  and a lack of toblerones . 
  i agree with your first point - i would n't volunteer to fight for the country in a war i did n't want . 
  but on the second point , if you 're not forced , you 're ok with being occupied if your army loses ? 
  what if someone like isis invaded ? 
  i wouldnt want to fight either , but i would because there 's nothing worse than being the first generation in a thousand years to let the country down and lose to an invader . 
  for me though , if someone was coming to invade my country ( especially someone like the nazis ) and they actually touched down in england , i would happily try and defend the country . 
  not for the government , the queen or anything else political . 
  just because i do n't want britain falling to foreign invaders . 
  i could n't live with the idea of being an occupied nation really . 
  if you actually value the country you live in , you should be prepared to defend it . 
  of course , by defence i mean purely from a legit invasion , not going to france or afghanistan to fight . 
  i like the swiss approach , they have their citizens trained and ready to fight off invaders , which is how it should be . 
  these people need to go in a mental institution . 
  it 's absolutely mad, 
  what they really should have asked in that third question is `` would you be willing to fight a foreign invader '' - if people are n't willing to do that if we actually had invaders on the shores , i 'd be a bit concerned . 
  your country is n't going to exist for long if nobody is willing to stand up for it . 
  i think western europe is less willing to fight because it generally means ending up in some desert in the middle of nowhere and getting blown up by an ied . 
  swedish hell does n't have any flat packed furniture i take it ? 
  cyprus is a great place to go , i ca n't believe they actually let you walk on roman mosaics there . 
  in the uk you 'd get lots of tuts and head shaking if you had the nerve to touch it . 
  it is a nice place in general , the locals all speak english , they 're quite friendly , it has nice scenery . 
  i can imagine it would be a nice place to retire if you like living in that climate . 
  i also like the lizards there , they 're cool . 
  not really european , but yeah , having him on europe 's doorstep is fucking bad . 
  your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries !, 
  better than being french everyday, 
  scotch eggs are fucking brilliant . 
   ** spray ** about a third of a can of ** cheese ** my god ... but that 's just ... 
  yes , it does seem to be a very british thing to get wankered in some foreign city and beat the shit out of each other whilst totally trashing the place . 
  it 's like cultural heritage or something . 
  sweden have flat packed dildos fyi, 
  that would pit turkey against every member of nato . 
  my favourite picture is this : http://imgur.com/a/07u1i, 
  i 'm glad i do n't live near any big cities !, 
  norfolk fuck yeah, 
  maces do a good job on plate armour . 
  edit : downvoted ? 
  you know blunt weapons can still do huge damage to knights in plate right ? 
  a mace could easily shatter your ribs or knock you out . 
  what we need is the colours and symbols to be from the heraldry of the nation !, 
  and we also killed chivalry at agincourt , 
  got to amuse yourself in between conquering the world , 
  i 'm crying patriotic tears !, 
  land of hope and glory !, 
  it 's cool , you 'd have the whole eu behind you :d maybe you can finally get constantinople back ? 
  [ just check this out , it 's pretty cool ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hliurd7d1q ) medieval armour was quite easy to move in , and the plate itself was almost impenetrable by stabbing weapons ( maces are a better choice ) . 
  just be thankful the axemen did n't have a pommel , otherwise he might have [ ended them rightly ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chex1luaaiy/maxresdefault.jpg ) ( yes , that is an historical manual advising you to throw your pommel at the enemy ), 
  it 's fine , i can understand that , 
  come to [ norwich ] ( http://www.outsidestudio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/norwich-skyline.jpg ) !, 
  it 's a fairly small , quiet city with a great university !, 
  there is a lot of pubs here too ( and churches actually ) , and the surrounding countryside is awesome !, 
  seriously , norwich is an awesome place . 
  it 's also a unesco world city of literature !, 
  oh , and it is not too far from london , its a couple of hours away by car - and there is trains there too . 
  i was playing around mate  i genuinely was n't accusing anyone , just playing along with the viking thing , as has been said , let 's wait and see what happened . 
  you can not deny this is another case of radical viking beserkism . 
  even the thought of it makes me feel uncomfortable . 
  we 've fought wars for our tea . 
  they 'd have to pry my tea from my cold , dead hands .
