  you can look, 
   that 's ridiculous . 
  like with any person / company / organisation / country / union , you make changes to your spending if your budget is changed . 
  it 's not a disastrous reduction given that there are many net contributors to the eu budget . 
  the uk is 12 % of the eus budget income . 
  a 12 % reduction in total income is a massive hit , simple as that . 
   so dream on if you think that the eu is going to bow down to the uk 's demands for a bit of extra money . 
  what the fuck . 
  i 'm not saying this , i never said the eu is going to have to bow down to the uk . 
  jesus christ stop putting words in my mouth because you have some weird punishment fantasy . 
   fine if one island wants to detach itself and become irrelevant . 
  lol . 
  ok , whatever you want to think buddy . 
  you 're a special little guy , keep doing you . 
  the world was in a right state till we discovered gravity let me tell you that . 
  do we get any thanks ? 
  typical .

   1 ) that the eu needs the uk 's contribution . 
  firstly , are many eu countries and other contributors to the eu budget , like norway and switzerland , that are much richer than the uk . 
  in fact , the uk is the poorest member out of the northern european countries . 
  second , the uk 's departure means that there will be a loss in the uk 's financial contributions but also a loss on the eu funds that go to the uk . 
  it does n't `` need '' the uks money , but it will seriously hurt without it . 
  the uk is one of the biggest * net * contributors in the eu . 
  [ the left side of the graph is countries that take more money out of the system than they put in . 
  the right side are the countries that pay in . ], 
  ( http://i.imgur.com/ht3xpgv.png ) the uk is a net contributor , that means it sends more money into the eu than it ever receives back . 
  it 's a net contribution , some of that money is spent back in the uk , some of it is spent to secure the countries that are n't net contributors . 
  the eu not having to send any money back in the uk does n't mean anything , because again , the uk is a net contributor . 
  it spends more than it gets . 
   there 's absolutely no reason why the eu should negotiate with the u.k. before article 50 is triggered . 
  that would just mean giving the uk a head start . 
  why would anyone agree to that ? 
  it 's the uk that wants out , it 's not being kicked out . 
  the u.k. has to come to the table and say what it wants . 
  it ca n't horse trade behind the backs of various countries ( countries that will have to sign off on any agreement ) . 
  cool thanks , that 's exactly what i was saying . 
  given that sch\u00e4uble stated `` 40-60 billion '' it seems to me like that the `` precisely '' part i mentioned is far from being worked out . 
  a 20 billion gap is a huge gap . 
  it all comes down to how hard defined the legal obligation to pay this bill is . 
  the parts with loose wording and obligation will be heavily contested . 
   why should the eu facilitate its own destruction ? 
  i 'm not saying it should . 
  i said i understood why it does n't . 
  i am not advocating that the eu should have engaged in pre-negotiations before article 50 was triggered . 
  what i am stating is the repercussions that have happened due to their decision not to . 
   the chaos in the uk is entirely the result of ambiguity in british domestic politics , which is trying to square the circle by claiming the benefits of the single market without the cost of the eu . 
  yet the two can not be separated . 
  right . 
  the chaos is purely because of british domestic politics . 
  so schaeuble saying `` you 're in , or you 're out '' when that is truly not the case with the eu is n't adding to the chaos ? 
  because it 's not as simple as schaeuble wants it to be . 
  you can be out of the eu and be an efta member , you can be out of the eu and be an eea member . 
  you can be out of the eu and have a custom made deal like switzerland . 
  you can be out of the eu and be an efta member * and * a eea member . 
  one size fits all has never been the operating standard of the eu . 
  and believe it or not `` you 're in or you 're out '' makes no fucking sense when it comes to the eu , and is not clarity . 
   chaos and lack of clarity are not the consequence of refusing pre-negotiations because the position of the eu is entirely clear . 
  ah , the eus position is entirely clear is it . 
  go ahead then , tell me , what is the eus goal relationship with the uk after article 50 has been concluded . 
  this should n't be a problem for you then . 
  does the eu want the uk in the efta&eea ? 
  does it want it in just the efta ? 
  does it want a custom made deal like switzerland ? 
  does it want a custom made efta deal , an efta + so to speak ? 
  does it want no deal at all and to revert to wto rules ? 
  out is out , right ? 
  well all these are options of `` out '' so which is it . 
  about as clear as opaque . 
  what has the eu made clear at all outside of populist statements from various government leaders , of whom tend to be contradicting each other on what they want in the first place . 
  the only thing i can think of is the refusal to negotiate on the 4 freedoms . 
  the eus position is refusing to say anything about it until article 50 is invoked and anything they say is weighed in their favour as much as possible in negotiations and that 's fine , really , that 's understandable within the eus rights to do . 
  but how can you sit there and simultaneously say that they 're the ones promoting clarity . 
  clarity would be pre-negotitations on good faith . 
  that is n't the case because the world is n't sunshine and rainbows . 
  the uk is in a blurred and chaotic situtation because may needs to get approval from parliament to invoke article 50 . 
  so she needs to go to parliament with a plan of what she wants from the eu . 
  so hypothetically let 's say she wants to seek with the eu a custom made efta deal . 
  something that is completely possible but will require hard negotiations . 
  so how does she promise that to parliament if the eu refuses to comment , negotiate or do anything until article 50 is invoked ... which requires permission from parliament . 
  british politicians ca n't promise any sort of deal with the eu when the eu has made no indication on what type of deal it itself wants to seek . 
  so again it all just comes down to everyone throwing out demands at one another , that 's all that can be done right now until negotiations begin . 
  you demand , then you negotiate . 
  this all comes back to the fact that the eu refuses to talk or do any sort of pre-negotiation with the uk government over what each country wants out of article 50 . 
  it 's well within the eus right to do this , but it has consequences . 
  i said the chaos right now over brexit is caused by the fact that the eu has forbidden pre-negotiations . 
  if you think the current situation has solely been caused by british politicians well , i just do n't really know what to say . 
  part of the chaos is due to incompetence from some cabinet members * cough boris cough * but the `` blame '' is shared for certain . 
  that does n't mean the position the eu is holding is wrong to do so from their standpoint , and i 'm not blaming them in the sense of `` how could you '' i 'm just saying what the situation is . 
  if you want to take my position of `` because of this , this is happening '' as me blaming them , well , that 's up to you i guess . 
  i personally do n't view it that way , and i do n't blame the eu for taking any of the choices they have for brexit negotiations . 
  actions have consequences , and the actions the eu took also have consequences . 
  chaos and lack of clarity is a consequence of refusing pre-negotitations . 
  do you really disagree with that ? 
  i 've never looked at this from a view of trying to assign blame , i 'm just trying to explain how we got here . 
   schaeuble is absolutely correct because it does n't make any sense for the uk to stay in the customs union since it will limit the uk 's ability to do trade deals with the rest of the world . 
  eea membership is just one of many options . 
  it 's the one i would most like but it 's definitely not the only one . 
   and stop blaming the eu . 
  how many times do i have to write `` by the way , i completely understand the eus position here and am not contesting if they should have done x or not '' it 's like talking to a wall .
