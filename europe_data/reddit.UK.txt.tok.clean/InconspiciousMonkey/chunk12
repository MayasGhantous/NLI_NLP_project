  \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af different perspectives i suppose . 
  the difference is we can control who from india and pakistan enter and stay in our country . 
   be a man and face up to the situation instead of weasling out and pretending the uk isnt a capitalist corrupt shithole i 'm pretty sure it is n't though . 
   op gave several examples of parts of britain being sold to foreign investors i must have forgotten when we sold london to the russians . 
  well at least something good came out of this dup shitstorm . 
  bonus points if this pisses off the dup so much they break their agreement . 
  the biggest difference is bad news for the uk vs bad news for other eu countries . 
  people love any story that involves the uk getting its comeuppance for voting for brexit . 
  here 's some examples in terms of vote and comment differences when it comes to bad news for the uk vs other eu countries . 
  looking at events pretty much just this week . 
  bad news : [ nomura announces they 're moving 100 jobs to frankfurt ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6is7i0/brexit_japanese_bank_nomura_chooses_frankfurt_for/ ) 2400 upvotes and 400 comments . 
  now let 's compare what happens when an article about brexit effecting other countries gets posted ? 
  [ post-brexit u.k. 
  car sales slump seen risking 18,000 german jobs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6j87yf/postbrexit_uk_car_sales_slump_seen_risking_18000/ ) 36 upvotes and 12 comments . 
  the difference in votes when it comes to bad news for the uk vs bad news for other eu countries is insane . 
  and i just wanted to link stuff that has just stuff that happened this past week , it 's a trend that very much runs for more than just this week . 
  here 's a ` good news ' post . 
  [ deutche bank buys building space in london for 400 million pounds ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6jn8iz/deutsche_bank_fund_buys_london_office_buildings/ ) 17 upvotes and 6 comments . 
  the exit deal actually requires a qualified majority , it 's only extending the negotiation period that requires unanimous agreement . 
  that means individual countries can not veto it , just vote ` no ' on whatever terms the eu and the uk come to after negotiations . 
  the uk needs 55 % of member states making up 65 % of the population of the eu to get any brexit deal through . 
  meaning you could have say ireland + poland + romania ( for example : maybe the final deal did not satisfyingly deal with the issue of citizen rights ) vote no and still achieve the deal as long as a qualified majority is reached . 
   `` that agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with article 218 ( 3 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  it shall be concluded on behalf of the union by the council , ** acting by a qualified majority ** , after obtaining the consent of the european parliament . '', 
   this could perhaps be a matter of semantics as i can for example also state that i am under no obligation to brake when driving towards a wall a 100km/h but the consequences of doing so are clear . 
  that 's only the case if you think that there will be a 100 % chance the uk gets a deal if it agrees to continue its commitments , which i do n't believe is a guarantee at all . 
  the consequences for the uk not agreeing to pay versus agreeing to pay are cloudy at best . 
  if the uk agrees to pay its past commitments but at the end of the 2 year period finds itself without a deal on its future relationship with the eu - that would be a worse situation than if the uk just refused to pay in the first place . 
  i think what this ultimately comes down to is if you think there will be a complete break-down of brexit talks and a no-deal situation . 
  in any situation where the uk & the eu successfully negotiate a new arrangement before brexit talks conclude then it will obviously involve some form of payment from the uk to the eu to settle the now continued legal obligations . 
  but were the talks to break down and the uk leaves with no type of advanced deal , the uk would be under no legal obligation to continue to uphold its previous commitments . 
  and it would be extremely politically unpopular for it do so in exchange for literally nothing . 
   why the fuck do you think these fiscal commitments are the treaties mentioned ? 
  the uk is part of the eu , as part of the eu it makes its contributions agreed upon within the eu . 
  when it is no longer a member of the eu , it no longer has any obligation to do that . 
  it 's literally that simple . 
  article 50 ends * all * treaties the uk and the eu have made together , that includes the uks obligation to pay member fees . 
  but you know , do n't take my word for it . 
  let 's see what the house of lords eu financial affairs committee said `` although there are competing interpretations , we conclude that if agreement is not reached , all eu law - ** including provisions concerning ongoing financial contributions ** and machinery for adjudication - will cease to apply , and the uk would be subject to no enforceable obligation to make any financial contribution at all . '', 
   not even your own gov says these commitments will all dissapear as if they never existed but will try to get them revised or argue to end some of em as well as to gain as much as possible in assets . 
  really ? 
  because publicly quite a few times david davis has stated the uk will not pay anything it does not legally owe . 
  and as we went over above the status of legally owing anything is quite in question . 
   do you think every journalist speculating on the endresult just pulled everything out of his/her ass ? 
  who should i trust ; a bunch of journalists copying the work the financial times did or a bunch of lawyers with expertise in eu law ? 
  tough one . 
   you 'll be rid of most laws , neither party will be ever be rid of the fiscal dealings till resolved . 
  well , not quite . 
  2 years from now if no deal is reached the fiscal dealings will be resolved - the uk will have no legal obligation to pay anything because the treaties that made the uk have to pay will no longer be in effect . 
  now the uk and the eu could make a deal in negotiations for the uk to continue funding things it has no obligation to continue doing so - but the question is what will the eu give up in return for that ? 
   that 's bullshit and you know it . 
  `` when we said that all treaties cease to apply , we did n't mean the ones where you have to give us money ! '', 
  the eu probably should have written it that way then . 
  the uks position is following the protocol set by the eu itself . 
  did you skip history class ? 
   my point ( which pretty much alignes with mr. gaventas opinion ) was that this is one of the many cases where the uk chose to obstruct the eus progress for no obvious reason . 
  another one would be a common military , explicitly without the uk , for example . 
  those are not obstructionist for the sake of obstruction though . 
  these climate regulations matter a lot . 
  and even then this is just the uk lobbying for lower regulation , the uk has not blocked them or said that it would veto or anything like that , it merely has a difference of opinion on how strict they should be set . 
  the common military the uk disagreed with as the uks position is that it would weaken nato . 
  which it would . 
  it still went ahead just with minor alterations to its status . 
   `` this smells of obstructionism , '' he can say it smells of it all he likes , the uk has not obstructed it . 
  it has not even gone to vote yet . 
  lobbying your position is not obstructionism . 
  vetoing it would be , but the uk is n't . 
   all those little things will backfire in the brexit talks . 
  i highly doubt michael bernier is going to look for payback because the uk dared to lobby that the upcoming vote on eu climate regulation should be a vote on a target that is 3 % lower . 
  i do n't think it 's going to be in his mind in any way shape or form actually . 
   then i gave you the latest statements from eu leaders which also confirm my point , that in fact alienation is already happening . 
  the eu already published its negotiating guidelines that michael bernier would be seeking on behalf of the eu . 
  they were pretty alright . 
  i 'm going to trust the official eu negotiating position over assumptions you 're making based on words said in election season . 
   right ... what was your point again ? 
  that lobbying for lower climate targets is not obstructionism and that i sincerely doubt that anybody in position of authority within the eu is going to be out to punish the uk because of it . 
  and that ultimately brexit has nothing to do with the position the uk holds and is not holding it to try and annoy the eu nor do i think is it viewed that way in brussels . 
   are you really that dense ? 
  we were talking about the eu playing hardball with the uk , because of them being a constant pain in the ass . 
  the climate change targets issue was only one of many other reasons why this will happen . 
  it 's a simple discussion really , should not be too hard to follow . 
  ` constant pain in the ass ' no bias here at all . 
  here 's the thing , the uk having a difference of opinion that the targets should be -3 % lower is not being a pain in the ass , it 's a minor difference of opinion that will get resolved . 
  it 's how the eu works , this type of stuff happens all the times with every country . 
   damn , son . 
  maybe read the stuff that you are replying to , here i 'll make it really simple for you , so you do n't have to read the whole discussion thanks man , really appreciate it . 
   because i literally mentioned the brexit talks in my first reply . 
  and people disagreed with you , and still disagree with you . 
  the only arguments you 've presented so far was a comment by a london based environmentalist think-tank . 
  your opinion was that the uk taking a stance that eu climate targets should be 3 % lower will backfire in brexit talks . 
  my opinion is nobody will give a shit about what the uk lobbied for the targets to be because it 's an extremely common thing to do and is how the entire eu works . 
   stop claiming anything else , because i just rubbed your nose into it try not to oversell yourself buddy . 
   i guessing you just can not handle the facts i provided in the actual discussion we have you 've literally provided no facts . 
  and no - statements from a think tank is not a fact , and neither is months old statements from eu leaders . 
  the eu leader statements had jack shit to do with any backfiring over this climate regulation debate . 
   as i said : you 're in denial uh , denial of what ? 
  that hard brexit is happening ? 
  why would i be in denial about that ? 
  may said she wanted to leave the single market like 5 months ago . 
  it 's old news .
