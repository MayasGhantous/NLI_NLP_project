  because if he has left the invoking of article 50 to his successor , that means it has yet to be invoked , and until it is invoked the uk is a member of the eu . 
  it does n't matter what you respect or feel , the only thing that matters is the law , and by law the uk is still a member of the eu until article 50 is explicitly invoked by the government of the uk . 
   no it does n't . 
  intent is enough . 
  no , `` intent '' is not enough , let 's quote shall we ? 
   `` a european council spokesman reiterated on saturday that triggering article 50 was a formal act which must be `` done by the british government to the european council '' . 
  `` it has to be done in an unequivocal manner with the explicit intent to trigger article 50 , '' the spokesman said . 
  `` it could either be a letter to the president of the european council or an official statement at a meeting of the european council duly noted in the official records of the meeting . 
  the uk has to officially go to the eu and make an official statement that it is enacting article 50 . 
  the uk government has yet to do this , article 50 has yet to be invoked and so the uk is still a eu member . 
   no , cameron had said once brexit was passed he would instigate it . 
  does n't matter what he said in campaign , article 50 needs to be invoked officially . 
   he uk is gone . 
  the eu now has 27 members . 
  no it is n't , article 50 has to be invoked for that to happen . 
  honestly you should just stop talking because you 're digging yourself deeper and deeper into bullshit . 
  until article 50 is officially declared to the european union by the government of the united kingdom the eu has 28 members . 
  until article 50 is invoked the uk is still a part of the eu , simple as that . 
   are we just going to ignore the mountain of evidence that proves otherwise ? 
  what mountain of evidence ? 
  a european country ignoring the results of an advisory referendum when it comes to eu matters ? 
  shocking . 
  they 're labeling it a victory for democracy because they 're voting to leave an institution they view as un-democratic . 
  why would you do this op . 
  why . 
  give me text or a video , the fuck is this shit . 
  the worse of both worlds . 
  in this moment , i am euphoric . 
  there was some worry the extreme weather in london would effect voter turnout . 
  been pissing it down here today . 
  this thread has 2 responses from people with british sub-flags , and both of them were from the same guy talking to somebody from ireland about visiting ireland .

  in / r/europe there 's definitely a lot of butthurt that 's for sure . 
  though maybe not from the side your insinuating . 
  legally though it 's a british overseas territory and with my poor law knowledge i think there 's some law voodoo magic things going on with that status . 
  for example because it 's bot spain can veto whatever brexit deal is reached from applying just to gibraltar , where as if it was a part of the full uk it would have to be vetoing the entire eu-uk deal . 
  or say the fact that gibraltar is n't a part of the customs union . 
  easy solution ; make gibraltar a place within the uk or merge it with england ... or wales , wales could use it i 'm sure . 
  the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ gibraltar * see , flows right off the tongue . 
  til, 
  * but why *, 
  fascinating , i 've never seen a photo showing the great colour transition . 
  it must have been distressing for the poor girl ; having to live her childhood half in colour and half out of it . 
  poor thing , but it had to be done . 
  but no seriously why is only half of the little girl and nothing else in colour , every other version of this photo i 've looked up is just normal black and white . 
  where did you find this frankenstein monster of a photo . 
  the eus statements from the beginning have always been `` absolutely no bi-lateral deals . 
  the eu is one '' to change from that is quite a big deal , because now they 're saying it 's completely okay for spain and the uk to make a bi-lateral deal together without the eus involvement . 
  you ca n't exactly say the british government is being stupid for believing the eus few talking points the entire run-up to brexit . 
  unless i guess if you think the eu has so little credibility the uk should have anticipated that the few things the eu have said was complete bollocks , but that 's a little unfair do n't you think . 
   or maybe you 're finally seeing how the rest of / r/europe sees you , think about it before dismissing it . 
  i fixed that for you . 
  you know i 'm not sure what it is but i suspect the author of this piece perhaps held a slight tad of bias . 
   they want to leave now , before the consequences of brexit catch up upon them . 
  you 're living in delusion if you think scotland would be able to leave the uk before brexit is finished when sturgeon was calling for a referendum about 6 months before brexit concludes . 
  the uk and the eu have been in a union for 40 years and it 's going to take 2 years of negotiations to leave . 
  scotland the ruk have been together for 300 years and are far more integrated in multiple ways , if you think that process of dis-entanglement can be completed in 6 months * and * somehow region the eu before the ` consequences ' of brexit happen , that 's just not going to be possible . 
  scotland will leave the eu and face ` the consequences of brexit ' regardless of if there was a vote on sturgeons timeline or not . 
  are you seriously trying to argue that applying for a work visa is harder than learning a new language and culture . 
  there 's more brits living in australia than every eu country combined after 40 years of free movement . 
  that alone should tell you that , no , requiring a work visa is not a big boundary for british citizens considering emigrating . 
  so i have nothing to get mad about now ? 
  dammit . 
  well yeah , that 's what i just said . 
  even then , unless scotland decides to become a efta member and forgoes eu membership it ca n't negotiate its own deal with the ruk . 
  it 'll have to take whatever is negotiated between the eu and the uk in brexit i do n't think there 's anyway shape or form that a iscotland will be able to leave the uk and re-enter the eu in time to be a part of the brexit negotiations , so the trade deal between the uk and the eu will not be crafted in any way to aid scotland-uk trade relations . 
   because we almost certainly wo n't get one . 
  so the uk in your opinion wo n't have a trade deal with the eu . 
  and the case for independence is so that scotland can remain a member of the eu . 
  so how exactly do you plan on reconciling the uk somehow getting a free trade deal with scotland , but simultaneously not having a free trade deal with the eu ? 
  the only way the above scenario is able to work is if scotland joins the efta instead of becoming a full eu member and negotiates its own separate trade deal with the uk , but i 've certainty not heard anybody campaigning for that . 
  and i would be quite surprised to given that the whole point of indyref 2 is because scotland voted not to leave the eu . 
  if you think scotland should be an eu member and that the uk will not get a trade deal with the eu post-brexit , then surely you recognise that scotland as a result will not have any trade deals with the ruk . 
  fair enough , sorry for being a bit of a dick about all this . 
  to be the biggest trade block does n't mean to be the biggest global exporters . 
  in 2016 the eu 28 had a gdp ( nominal ) of 17.1 trillion , the us had 18.5 trillion , canada had 1.5 trillion and mexico had 1.1 trillion , meaning the combined total gdp of nafta is ( roughly ) 20-21 trillion . 
  these figures are based on the [ imfs 2016 figures ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=32&amp;pr.y=19&amp;sy=2015&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=512%2c672%2c914%2c946%2c612%2c137%2c614%2c546%2c311%2c962%2c213%2c674%2c911%2c676%2c193%2c548%2c122%2c556%2c912%2c678%2c313%2c181%2c419%2c867%2c513%2c682%2c316%2c684%2c913%2c273%2c124%2c868%2c339%2c921%2c638%2c948%2c514%2c943%2c218%2c686%2c963%2c688%2c616%2c518%2c223%2c728%2c516%2c558%2c918%2c138%2c748%2c196%2c618%2c278%2c624%2c692%2c522%2c694%2c622%2c142%2c156%2c449%2c626%2c564%2c628%2c565%2c228%2c283%2c924%2c853%2c233%2c288%2c632%2c293%2c636%2c566%2c634%2c964%2c238%2c182%2c662%2c359%2c960%2c453%2c423%2c968%2c935%2c922%2c128%2c714%2c611%2c862%2c321%2c135%2c243%2c716%2c248%2c456%2c469%2c722%2c253%2c942%2c642%2c718%2c643%2c724%2c939%2c576%2c644%2c936%2c819%2c961%2c172%2c813%2c132%2c199%2c646%2c733%2c648%2c184%2c915%2c524%2c134%2c361%2c652%2c362%2c174%2c364%2c328%2c732%2c258%2c366%2c656%2c734%2c654%2c144%2c336%2c146%2c263%2c463%2c268%2c528%2c532%2c923%2c944%2c738%2c176%2c578%2c534%2c537%2c536%2c742%2c429%2c866%2c433%2c369%2c178%2c744%2c436%2c186%2c136%2c925%2c343%2c869%2c158%2c746%2c439%2c926%2c916%2c466%2c664%2c112%2c826%2c111%2c542%2c298%2c967%2c927%2c443%2c846%2c917%2c299%2c544%2c582%2c941%2c474%2c446%2c754%2c666%2c698%2c668&amp;s=ngdpd&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ), 
  well , sorry , but that 's wrong . 
  click it yourself and find out ? 
  you ca n't just blindly trust your first google result . 
  click the link yourself , it compares the eu to the usa . 
  not the eu to nafta , which is the us+c anada + mexico . 
  which is bigger than the eu as a trade block . 
  the source is the european commissions website , which compares trade blocks and compares the eu to the usa , instead of comparing the eu to nafta ( because you know , then they could n't claim it 's the biggest if they did that ) . 
  the us is part of nafta , so just looking at how your trade block compares to just the usa , is , well , stupid and trying to spin figures . 
  if you 're talking about the biggest trade blocks in the world why would you compare the eu to the usa ? 
  because if they compared it with the eu to nafta , the eu would be smaller . 
  that does n't really go well on a website to promote to the eu . 
  oh , and the figures from the european commissions website are 4 years out of date . 
  not going into the fact all these figures for the eu are all based on the uk being inside of it , which is a bit redundant when the uk is leaving . 
  nafta is the biggest trading block in the world . 
  just saying . 
  i hear the queen also lay eggs inside them to breed more lizard people once their term of service is done . 
  think about it , where are the previous last pms in the news ? 
  david cameron ? 
  tony blair ? 
  gordon brown ? 
  all mysteriously absent from the public eye . 
  if they were n't still under the control of ` her ' then how come they are n't protesting against brexit with the people ? 
  checkmate .
