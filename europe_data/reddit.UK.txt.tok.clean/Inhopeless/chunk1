what ? 
  okay . 
  thank you for clearing that up for me . 
  in that case , surely there should be coverage partners ? 
  besides this wo n't really matter for the big players ( vodafone , orange , t-mobile , telefonica , three ) because they have a lot of eu states in their coverage range . 
  well , they can fuck off . 
  i can buy finnish bread if i wanted to , no british bread maker can stop me . 
  this is the modern world , and i 'm sorry if it will hurt their eeny-weeny profits if i use my rights as a european citizen to get the cheapest deal possible . 
  if telcos are willing to shaft me without remorse , then i will shaft them . 
  it 's their fault that they ca n't be competitive with other european networks , not mine . 
  they can fuck off . 
  if roaming fees get abolished permanently , would that mean i could ( theoretically ) get a plan from another eu state that is cheaper than here ? 
  what is this madness i feel so happy . 
  lumia master race . 
  well , it 's going to be a tough debate , but i am sure there are some things we can agree on , eg schizophrenia , cystic fibrosis , that need to be gotten rid of . 
  sure . 
  but not for cosmetic reasons . 
  it is unfair for people to `` design '' their baby 's genes because they have money , although that future is a long way away . 
  but to get rid of genetic diseases and hereditary disorders ? 
  yes . 
  your canadian girlfriend is commonwealth , and can therefore vote in any and all elections that are held in the united kingdom . 
  including eu and local . 
  we should bribe the anti-eu parties with \u00e9clairs . 
  `` look guys !, 
  if you leave , you 'll miss out on these fucking tasty \u00e9clairs ! '', 
  should 've thought about that before you tried invading , no ? 
  i have been told that birmingham ( uk ) is rather like a chicago . 
  except without trams . 
  will this mean that , in 2015 , i can get a ( relatively ) cheap sim from another state and use it in my phone here ? 
  excellent . 
  i will look forward to undercutting uk operators . 
  its amazing , some of the talking points pushed around . 
  i especially like the one about eurocrats . 
  except that there are more civil servants in one government department in the uk than there are in the entire eu establishment . 
  ... well , it is thanks to putin . 
  i am curious about the state of mobile telecoms in other eu states . 
  i think the city of birmingham symphony orchestra does free shows every once in a while . 
  you have an interesting question here . 
  i ca n't speak for all eu countries , i can only speak for britain , but ( as far as i am aware ) most eu states have a general consensus about things . 
  in america , for example , welfare seems to be split between the democratic position of `` expand it '' , and the gop position of `` restrict it heavily/get rid of it '' . 
  in europe , there 's that consensus of the welfare state being good for society . 
  the only disagreement is * what role * it has . 
  let 's take abortion . 
  in america , that debate is incredibly muddled and fraught with danger . 
  even the democratic party wants to lean rightwards upon it . 
  in most eu states , abortion is supported by ( at the least ) the major right-wing and major left-wing parties . 
  by the right-wing as a necessary evil ( backstreet abortions are very dangerous ) and by the left-wing as female choice . 
  america has a lot of debates that europe does n't have , because european states never needed a reason to have those debates ( decriminalising abortion in the uk had enormous political support - * in the 1950s * ) . 
  in america , the democrats are blue . 
  in britain , the conservatives ( centre-right ) are blue . 
  they have very similar positions on things ( except economics ) , so i guess the democrats still would be `` blue '' here . 
  in that sense , you could say the red of the republicans are as if they so right-wing that they warped all the way around the colour spectrum and ended up in red . 
  :p i find it ludicrous that obama is painted as some sort of socialist sympathiser . 
  if obama is considered socialist , then you are welcome to see what britain is like ( i would argue that britain is one of the more right-wing countries in the eu ) . 
  another point to make is that the debate in europe is mostly economical * with social elements * , whereas the us is a very social debate * with economical elements * . 
  i am saying that here , political platforms diverge on financial/economics with their social implications . 
  like i mentioned earlier with the welfare state , ( at the very least ) the major right - and left-wing parties will have similar social policy , but divergent economic platforms . 
  for example , in the uk , labour ( left ) supports stimulus . 
  the conservatives ( right ) support austerity . 
  both parties will make a case for their viewpoint but say things like `` but with austerity/stimulus the other party will be allowed to eat your babies ! '', 
  in the us , however , there is a fiscal/economic similarity . 
  both parties support a heavily free-marketed , limited-government ( it may not seem like the democrats do that , but trust me , they do ) , with minimal safety nets . 
  the divergence is their social issues * and the economic implications * . 
  a good example is welfare . 
  the democrats support it ( kind of ) and the republicans do not ( kind of ) . 
  that 's the social divergence . 
  the implications would be like `` the welfare lack/overfunding will mean that hard-working americans wo n't be able to buy giant pizza cakes ! '' . 
  i hope this ( admittedly long-winded ) post helps clear up what you want to know . 
  i 'm a little bit tired , so some of the language might not make sense , but ask more questions !, 
  ** birmingham , uk ** the second-largest city in the uk , and the largest local authority in these european states . 
  we have just over one million people , which is a seventh of that of greater london . 
  i would argue its the home of the industrial revolution , what with us inventing the steam engine . 
  we 're also home to one of the world 's largest ammunitions factories ( ironic , considering britain does n't do guns ) . 
  good : very diverse , in terms of people . 
  its also very easy to travel around ( via commuter rail and bus ) . 
  there 's also a lot to do , especially in the summer when the four squares ( victoria ; centenary ; chamberlain ; oozells ) have events going on . 
  besides that , we have two world-class orchestras , three theatres , and more cinemas that i can be bothered to visit . 
  oh , and i will not leave out the amazing library of birmingham , which is the largest municipal library in europe . 
  bad : budget cuts are digging deep , mostly because the central government hates cities , and has hated non-london cities since the 1960s . 
  the city council is incompetent at everything , and is also being sued for underpaying female workers . 
  the city ca n't expand because we 're surrounded by other urban areas to the east and west , and we only have suburbs in the north and south , so if we expanded out , we 'd only expand them . 
  other britons love to make fun of us , which is entirely stupid . 
  the council was going to launch city-subsidised fibre broadband to everyone a few years ago , but the private infrastructure oligarchy ( bt and virgin ) sued the city and stopped it . 
  fun fact : we also invented the bus timetable . 
  i can only speak for my urban area , but chinese and e asians are seen as hard working people who make delicious food . 
  i do n't think they are perceived as negatively as other racial groups . 
  in britain in general , they are seen as well-off ( i have never heard of poor chinese britons ) . 
  england ** good ** * education is focused on rounding an individual , as opposed to rote learning . 
  * inquisitively is encouraged . 
  * our universities are world-leading , and even the ones that are n't world-leaders are good at *** teaching *** things . 
  ** bad ** * university is expensive . 
  while there are grants and loans available , it simply is n't enough to subsist upon . 
  * the current government are insistent on pretty much killing state schools . 
  history and english have effectively become jingoism studies ( my niece in secondary school has been learning ** solely ** about great british figures in history , as opposed to having an awesome , well-rounded view of how the world came to be . ), 
  * money is tight for schools . 
  * the government 's pet project , free schools ( schools set up by organisations or parents groups using state money ) is incredibly shady . 
  ** mixed ** * we have a tripartite system of schooling ( in select cities ) . 
  state comprehensives/state grammars/independent . 
  grammar schools are those who are academically-gifted , but bear no different to regular state schools except being for middle-class people and having better teachers than regular state comprehensives . 
  if you 're sensitive about cost , long-distance coaches/buses are amazing .
