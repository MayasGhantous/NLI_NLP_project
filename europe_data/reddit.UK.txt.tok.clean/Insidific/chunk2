  this entire thing will be a non story in a week . 
  sure and that 's what 's going to happen . 
  i 'm not refuting the economy will suffer but i do n't think they wo n't survive . 
  of course and everyone thought the uk would n't care about the falklands and just let it go , but it did n't it stuck to it 's commitment and defended it . 
  that 's what should be remembered from that horrible conflict . 
  yes . 
  it 's a hypothetical and i do n't think scotland would need convincing , it would n't be a new treaty , countries have been added and removed from the uk for centuries . 
  scotland may be one of the countries removed in the near future , 
  i do n't think them becoming part of the uk would actually be any different than what they are now , it 's just under a different name , `` british overseas territory '' . 
  i do n't think they 've ever been on good terms with spain . 
  but a nation wo n't fall because it does n't have access to the eu , gib was blockaded before the eu was formed by spain for years . 
  trying to find anything that brings up the falklands in my comment . 
  i ca n't seem to see anything , perhaps you can quote it for me ? 
  really , does the rest of the world just disappear or are you just talking about the little bit of the world that is europe will disappear ? 
  i never said not allow , i said the uk wants gib to be included , they do n't want them to be excluded . 
  but it 's going to be up for discussion like everything . 
  but they might just make gib part of the uk , and give them all the powers they already have so that the deal the uk gets will apply to gib as part of the uk . 
  but that 's unlikely but possible i 'd think . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/635u2f/spain_tells_uk_to_calm_down_over_gibraltarbrexit/dfrnk47/ saying it was in the same comment thread , when it was n't but you know it 's fine , do n't worry about it , 
  nope clearly not , as argentina has been rebuffed regarding discussions on sovereignty since the war as they refuse to have them with the falkland islands , though i 'm not sure of spains position on have gib in discussions . 
  of course and that 's why the uk wants gib included in the uk wide agreement rather than having a deal with a separate bi-lateral agreement with spain which has been discussed by the eu . 
  as they 're taking the point that gib is a separate entity . 
  to gib , who has regular incursions into there waters , they know spain wants sovereignty of them . 
  they 're not the enemy , but still assurance needs to be given that it wo n't ever happen unless they want the change . 
  it 's very simple politics  enemy is very black and white , when really spain and the uk are allies , but issues like this occasionally bubble up to the surface . 
  you just need to look back a couple of years and issues pop up every now and again . 
  yeah exactly , i usually write the way i 'd pronounce everything because it 's easier , but never usually grammatically correct , just one of those things . 
  if i 'd read what i 'd put i would 've noticed it . 
  but it 's fine to call me out on it , only way i 'll learn , i have n't made the mistake since i do n't think , 
  link to what ? 
   i 'm sorry you seem pretty stressed , these threads would be easier to partake in if you 'd link in the original comment that you already answered the question here , than after i called you out , 
  it likely will never be hostile , the uk government will just do what they do with the falklands , unless gibraltar is party to any discussions then none will be happening . 
  the discussions will just be , gibraltar wants to be british and unless they change there mind will remain so , it 's an easy position to hold . 
  his words are n't wrong , in the event of attack gib would be defended , but the media has gone wild with every sensational piece of news . 
  the views of the government are nothing new and i do n't know why everyone is so shocked . 
  if your fingers are constantly being told they belong to someone else , i imagine they 'd be worried one day they 'll be chopped off and need a reassurance that wo n't happen . 
  well anything that comes out of his mouth should be interpreted as his own and not what the government thinks . 
  that 's why all the headlines over the weekend have n't been that the uk government said this rather michael howard . 
  if you 're going to make a untrue comment that 's fine but do n't expect not to be called out on it . 
  you had n't made the comment in the comment thread , link to the comment , `` i answered that already here '' , that 'd sort it , 
  better for the fingers to hear it directly from the body though rather than from the hand . 
  well there you go then . 
  so it was a hypothetical question asked , with a clear answer given and unlikely to ever happen . 
  but everyone knows the position the uk government would take and that 's all that matters . 
  but he does n't speak for the government and his views are strictly his own . 
  then intredasted 's limbs start thinking whether they 'll actually be protected since he wo n't give a straight answer . 
  it 's not the same comment thread . 
  wish i could avoid discussion and say i 've already answered something after all the commenting i 've had to do in this thread . 
  ah but that 's not how it happened . 
  it would go : person : `` would you attack insidific if he attacked you ? '', 
  intredasted : `` of course i would '' person : `` oh ok then '' then it 's more like all the children in the play ground hear that there might be a fights and start talking shit , but there wo n't actual be a fight because insidific and intredasted wo n't fight each other but everyone 's still trying to shout the loudest so people will pay attention to them . 
  you know , i think i am, 
  where ? 
  i 'm looking up the thread and you have n't discussed what he should say at all ? 
  which is exactly what was said in the interview and has been the position of the government the whole entire time . 
  war was n't on the agenda . 
  what enemy ? 
  an enemy is not being invented , a hypothetical question is being answered . 
  a question which ca n't be dodged and needs a clear answer . 
  will the uk government defend gibraltar from physical attack . 
  which of course the answer is yes , it 's never going to happen but of course it 's a yes . 
  now the uk government has moved on , it no longer cares , but media outlets are getting a lot of traffic from this so attempts to stir the pot as long as possible . 
  but really no one cares . 
  as long as gibraltar gets to do what they want as a little outcrop near the mediterranean no one really cares . 
  but the uk government did n't say the `` if you punch me '' how you should word that is . 
  other person : if spain punches you will you punch them back ? 
  uk : of course . 
  i 'm sure i 've linked the video multiple times on this thread , but the question was posed and the incredulous reply was the uk would defend gibraltar . 
  it 's not a question of rebuff , you need to reaffirm the commitment to gibraltar , that they 're sovereignty will be protected . 
  it 's not a dodge-able question because then the headline read `` uk governments dodges question on defending gibraltar '' . 
  so the uk government has discussed invading spain then ? 
  or was it a hypothetical question posed by a journalist regarding spain attacking gibraltar and they answered accordingly . 
  because the two mean rather different things . 
  maybe you need to do some more research then , because war has n't been mentioned by the uk government . 
  they have answered like they do every-time something happens with spain and gibraltar , that they would defend gibraltars interests . 
  exactly , i do n't understand why people ca n't understand that concept . 
  the uk government has said repeatedly , they will ** defend ** gibraltar , there needs to be an attacker to defend against , so they are n't being aggressive . 
  in the event of an attack on gibraltar the uk government will ( again ) ** defend ** gibraltar . 
  all they 've done is answer the same questions repeatedly regarding would the uk government defend gibraltar and they 've all answered yes they would defend gibraltar . 
  case closed do n't worry about it , we now know the position of the uk government . 
  but oh wait here 's some inflammatory headline we can use to get traffic and sell news papers . 
  are you taking actual quotes or just being hyperbolic . 
  i 've replied to a lot of your comments , so i assume it 's all just hyperbole . 
  the uk government did n't discuss war either , they repeated the phrase they will defend gibraltar . 
  which does n't mean war . 
  spain would have to forcefully attack for defence to be forceful in anyway . 
  generous regarding what , he specifically said  starting a war with our allies i argued against that saying war is n't being declared . 
  problem with that ? 
  why weaken the tone , they need to be clear that they would defend gibraltar . 
  as again any government in the world would do . 
  which of course you 'd do . 
  would your government not defend your territory ? 
  was it , he seems quite shocked that it was even a question at all . 
  you can watch it here . 
  this is the defence secretary speaking , someone in actual government . 
  they did n't reiterate his words , they 've all just said they will defend gibraltar . 
  which any government would give that answer to defend territory . 
  i think you just do n't like the british , when you run out of things to say against the points i 've made you just start name calling . 
  spain position has never been just that they want the tax haven gone , after the referendum they wanted joint sovereignty which was rebuffed . 
  sorry and you 'd know that how ?
