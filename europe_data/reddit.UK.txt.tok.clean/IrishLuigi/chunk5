  there 's no love lost here . 
  you are definitely correct for the short-term . 
  for me , the appeal is in the thought of the most thin-skinned and intolerant of my peers leaving . 
  akin to a 5 year old throwing a tantrum and pretending to pack up . 
  i wish they 'd actually go . 
  whatever you say , it is an opinion held by a part of their population . 
  if you want to learn anything from brexit and president trump , it 's to acknowledge and engage those voters in debate instead of pretending they do n't exist . 
   there is 0 support in leaving the union in france . 
  has turned into  33 % will vote to leave . 
  my job is done here , thanks for the clarification . 
   there is 0 support in leaving the union in france . 
  stop talking out of your arse m8 . 
  take a look at [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36471989 ) , or more specifically , [ this ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/7756/production/_89905503_how_europeans_view_eu_gra624.png ) . 
  the french are more or less about as euroskeptic as the brits . 
  burying your head in the sand on this will only just create even more manufactured outrage if it happens , whether in the next year , or a few years down the line . 
  it might be more of a. . . final solution . 
  looked it up . 
  the filter itself is made of plastic . 
  self-defeating , is n't it ? 
   i would love a globalized world with a lot of decentralization . 
  so what 's wrong with this world , then ? 
  you sound like you basically want nation states cooperating together via a global body ( the un ? 
  so we might have federal sanctions `` for promoting degeneracy '' to look forwards to , then ? 
  authoritarian globalists ? 
  god save us . 
  it is the inevitable end result of the process . 
  globalisation is also a threat to our way of life . 
  just imagine . 
  there is one world government . 
  every citizen on this planet gets a vote . 
  every single citizen . 
  we 'll be welcoming back the death penalty for gays and other archaic , backwards aspects soon enough . 
  are you replying to the right person ? 
   cromwell is another such figure that is controversial in the modern sense , but also a very good leader . 
  modern lens or no , cromwell is the guy who single-handedly convinced the uk to restore the monarchy . 
  that 's how much people did n't like his leadership . 
  the meme that cromwell was a great leader needs to die . 
   that would be unacceptable today . 
  for people who would rather spend it on the poor . 
  i say we disregard the poor and acquire national wonders . 
   ended up being useless not for me . 
  thanks m8 !, 
  perhaps it 's cheaper in the longer term . 
  i can see other countries ignoring the unstable soil and constantly spending money to repair their roads . 
  indeed it is fortunate for them . 
  if they did the same thing in almost any of our past ages , they 'd be dead . 
   insane and massively contradictory lies is your country not the insane one ? 
  and are the lies not actually symbolic of your current situation ? 
  does the ship blocking result into a deliberate death of an european seaman ? 
  if not , then i expect the captain would know the best thing to do . 
  perhaps use our superior turbines to circumvent them . 
   hurr male circumcision just like fgm lol amirite guys, 
  perhaps if sweden got its shit together , poe 's law would no longer apply to you guys . 
  otherwise , you 're just complaining about a symptom , not the cause . 
  if they kill an european in their attack ( if they are ever stupid enough to do that ) , then i of course expect war . 
  the problems begin when almost anyone from shithole countries can be classified as `` refugees '' . 
  * something something * ** human rights ** * something something *, 
  you seem to have selective blindness . 
  77 cents to a dollar ** for the same work ** . 
  77 cents to a dollar ** over a wide section of the general employent market ** . 
  other people have pointed this out to you in this thread , yet you still continue to fail to address it . 
  i see this as a disingenuous method of consent by silence . 
  when you reframe the issue , you fail to acknowledge or even clarify that the `` for the same work '' bit is , indeed , total horseshit . 
   2 percent sounds plausible , but 4 or 7 less so . 
  what happened to the 23 % figure ? 
  are you accepting that it 's bullshit ? 
  why keep defending the `` 77 cents to a dollar for the same work '' lie , then ? 
   the israelis would be happy to live in peace . 
  yes , peacefully building settlements all over palestine . 
  the difference between 40 and 50 pushups may very well be vital when you 're trying to drag the body of an injured colleague , both in full battle gear . 
  this . 
  i always wanted to be a soldier when i was a kid . 
  i found out that , as a deaf person , the army would n't even consider me . 
  it was difficult , but i have come to terms with it . 
  i am not going to jeopardise my colleagues on the battlefield by demanding that they lower standards for this special little snowflake . 
  and then i see this shit . 
  they have the audacity to lower standards to allow in a whole category of people who are so self-centred that they do n't care about potentially jeopardising their colleagues on the battlefield . 
   these would include possible benefit to group dynamics by having a more diverse group i do n't see how one leads to the other . 
  what 's to stop the men responding to their instinct by being protective of the women ? 
  the primeval forest is not a self-contained ecosystem . 
  what happens in the forests around it , whether natural or man-made , will affect the primeval ecosystem in ways beyond our comprehension . 
  however , i do n't see his point that we absolutely have to leave the whole forest alone . 
  if the polish want to try out logging to stop the woodworm reaching the primeval forest , let them . 
  only a few decades later , will we know who was right in this argument . 
  it is something which has arisen out of the american educational system . 
  it seems that they have lost the ability or thinking capability to identify higher forms of humour , such as sarcasm . 
  this leads to unnecessary arguments , so to keep the peace , they pre-emptively kill their jokes with a well-placed / s. 
  this has unfortunately spread to some of the lower-form droolers and knuckle-draggers in europe . 
  be vigilant . 
  downvote all instances of / s. 
  stop importing more muslims and encourage an ahmadiyya reform amongst british muslims in the uk . 
  at the moment , the muslim brotherhood wants the uk government to ban the ahmadiyya sect . 
  ahmadiyyas are basically the islam equivalent of a moderate christian sect : pro-gay rights , pro-choice and all that . 
  i 'd say it 's sublimely ironic . 
  then , we imposed our culture onto other countries , and justified it as the morally righteous thing to do . 
  now , we are marginalising our own culture , and we are justifying it as the morally righteous thing to do . 
   minorities are n't trying to force theirs on the people there no need . 
  they 're outbreeding the natives . 
  i disagree with both of you . 
  if there is a hard border , it will be because the eu decided to impose it , in response to negotiations .
