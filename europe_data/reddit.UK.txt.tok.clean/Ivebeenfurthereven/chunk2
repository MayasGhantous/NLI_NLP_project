  that high up , there is no sensation of depth , so they look like swimming pools rather than vertical structures . 
  yellow swimming pools the size of cities . 
  it took me a long time to work out what i was looking at . 
  10/10 would keep my window blind open again, 
  fascinating reading , thank you !, 
  that sounds interesting , when did this happen ? 
  most icbms - including trident - have a star-tracker for celestial navigation . 
  after all , they 're designed for a hot war , so they always work without gps - it 'd be stupid to assume that vulnerable system is still functional in a nuclear war . 
  the submarines themselves can easily position-fix without a gps signal . 
  if i trust anyone 's sextant navigation work , it 'd be a naval officer 's, 
  what yougov poll was this and what statement were they agreeing with ? 
  i realise that the plural of anecdote is not data , but i do live here , and that seems high . 
  i mean the petition to ban the guy from entering the uk for inciting racial hatred has become the most popular of all time on parliament 's website . 
  over half a million signatures , which is practically unheard of . 
  yes , many british people have right-wing views , but he 's everything we hate in a politician ; that shiny , sycophantic american-dream bullshit is looked down on over here . 
  you realise the man is literally unelectable right ? 
  the republican party can only stay relevant by picking up hispanic and black votes . 
  neither demographic will ever vote for him . 
  and it 's impossible to get to the white house without taking these demographics with you now - just ask mitt romney . 
  huh , i did n't know that was a thing . 
  quite a good idea really . 
  still , this thread is an unbelievable echo-chamber of far-right views . 
  i just got an orangered saying that banning all muslims from entering europe would be a considered response to a `` serious issue '' , and chiding me for the ` ad hominem ' of making a donald trump joke with no apparent irony ... do these people not realise how utterly unacceptable their views are to most of the `` silent majority '' of the population they claim to represent ? 
  i do n't know * anyone * in britain who agrees with trump , it 's just nutters and fruitcakes , but this thread would fucking love him . 
  as well as attacking the police , disrupting a democratic hearing , and claiming it 's justified because it was `` all decided ahead of time and just for show '' apparently . 
  we 're a default now ? 
  i thought / r/europe had been brigaded ( / r/ukpolitics used to be a centre-left-ish subreddit , until 4chan 's / pol / repeatedly brigaded the place , did something with the moderation team and , long story short , totally took over with rabid ukip supporters . 
  it 's been pretty right-wing ever since ) . 
  but why would you want / r/europe to be a default ? 
  americans everywhere ... 
   alright , i think all european nations should stop taking in permanent residents who are muslim . 
  found donald trump on reddit , everyone, 
  this thread is really fucking weird . 
  it seems a * lot * of commenters are comfortable with a neo-nazi riot - fuck off with your ` will of the local people ' , that 's * exactly * what this is by definition no matter where they lived - and are pretty keen to defend it . 
   because they truly are the little closet racists and fascists that they pretend not to be . 
  props for voicing your opinion in this cesspool . 
  the fuck happened to / r/europe ? 
  it never used to be like this , for example ( quoted from above ) :  there has never been true `` asylum seekers '' in europe , only economic migrants . 
  even shoud there be some , they may never flee to europe , i do n't want my tax money be spent on people i 'm not related to and culturally alien . 
  if europe should take refugees , i think only people of european descent should be let in , for example white south africans who are currently being marginalized by the majority of the population in their homeland . 
  let them return to the netherlands instead what the fuck is going on in here ? 
  source : shit 4chan 's / pol / says , by the sounds of it . 
  ( i 'm guessing . 
  i 'd rather like to emigrate to the netherlands next year and i 'm hoping it does n't become an immigrant-bashing enclave . ), 
  i used to hate it when i was young , but i 've realised it 's not so simple as that : countries with consistent sunshine tend to be very dusty without much greenery ( to pick on spain particularly , even the human-planted grass is far less pleasant underfoot , it 's scratchy instead of soft ) . 
  britain could not have such beautiful landscapes without a heady mix of sunshine and rain , which i now appreciate more . 
  britain is almost unique in the world for its constant change and unpredictability in the atmosphere , which has contributed hugely to our national culture , and adds a certain romance . 
  yes , it rains , but it never rains for * long * : next week will always be different , which is somehow genuinely good for my mental health when i otherwise feel stuck in a rut . 
  awe-inspiring weather that 's never monotonous and continually in flux gives you a sense of appreciation for the world outdoors . 
  here is a good example of what i 'm talking about : http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07bpbyp, 
  will trade for your chefs . 
  definitely < 3, 
  as a dirty europhile who loves france i 'd be in favour , actually . 
  better food , better language , prettier girls , more culture , hilarity while everyone learns to drive on the wrong side of the road ... 10/10 please come and take over westminster, 
  huh , did n't know that !, 
  til . 
  it bears little relevance to the argentine railings on the diplomatic stage today , though , as in the article i linked . 
  thatcher is dead , and so is the military junta . 
  we 'd like friendlier relations but they refuse to drop this ridiculous idea that something has been * taken * from them, 
   i suppose it 's cool if indonesia start capturing uninhabited islands off the british coast and patrol the waters with their navy ? 
  if they 're 300 miles off the coast , then they 'd be a long way out in mid-atlantic - so yep , sure , that would literally be fine . 
  they were never argentine territory . 
  why do you think the people who call the falklands home do n't deserve a voice ? 
  for someone arguing against war and nationalism , you seem pretty keen to support the fact that argentina 's dictatorship started a war and overthrew their democracy by force . 
  i too was hoping for a hell of a lot better to be honest , but it 's the only one i found at all . 
  come on / r/europe , roast me ( us ), 
   it 'd look like a damn stupid flag with a dragon on it do you mean * ' a flag suitable to conquer a quarter of the world with ' * ? 
  what could have been ... 
  this one 's pretty good actually : [ piss off southern england - well , the south west at any rate - by saying < * other country *  makes much better cider ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4k27q7/how_to_irritate_a_citizen_of_each_european/d3bmeac?context=30 ), 
  absolutely , but the question was `` how to irritate a citizen of ... [ the uk ] '' . 
  this one works !!, 
  even over in / r/argentina they are constantly asked how they feel about ` las malvinas ' ... and the general consensus always seems to be that the gov ' t is using a pointless , irrelevant non-issue to try and distract people from problems at home . 
  but then again , the userbase of reddit does n't represent what the general population thinks . 
  what 's really maddening is that in the midst of the argentine invasion , the usa maintained a policy of ** neutrality ** during the falklands war . 
  imagine if us territory was invaded , their citizens controlled by foreign troops , and [ britain was secretly planning to support the other side ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052702303816504577313852502105454 ) . 
  in fact , [ hillary clinton and barack obama are decidedly lukewarm on this , offering to ` mediate negotiations ' that neither britain nor her subjects consider fair or reasonable . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1253878/falkland-islands-oil-row-hillary-clinton-steps-argentina-stand-off.html ) `` special relationship '' , ** my arse . 
  ** ^ ( this is why we should n't ) ^ ^ leave ^ ^ the ^ ^ eu ^ ^ ^ ... 
  always wondered : do your caribbean possessions have the same excellent cycle tracks everywhere and people riding bikes ? 
  how similar or different are they from the netherlands in europe ? 
  that 's pretty much it , aye . 
  most of us have no problem with argentina * per se * - certainly not with the residents , who often hate their government 's fiery rhetoric and obvious propaganda to distract from domestic issues like a freefalling economy - but the fact that a military dictatorship made an ill-judged gamble in the 1980s on invading some british islands , and got kicked out , was embarrassing . 
  the fact that the current democratically-elected governments keep doing things like [ banning the only commercial airline route between the islands and south america ] ( http://en.mercopress.com/2012/02/03/uk-warns-argentina-on-cutting-off-the-air-link-of-falklands-with-south-america ) ; [ harassing marine traffic that wants to trade there from going elsewhere on the continent ] ( http://en.mercopress.com/2011/12/21/mercosur-supports-argentina-bans-access-to-all-falklands-malvinas-flagged-vessels ) ; [ banning cruise ships that have called at port stanley from visiting argentina at all ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17184955 ) ; rabble-rousing at the un about ` decolonisation ' and [ accusing us of threatening them with nuclear weapons ] ( http://en.mercopress.com/2013/02/26/argentina-accused-uk-of-sending-submarines-with-nuclear-weapons-capacity-to-the-falklands ) ... ... that 's more than exasperating , it 's like banging your head against an aircraft carrier 's bulkhead wall . 
  bonus round : [ all public transport in argentina is now legally required to display signs saying '' * las malvinas son argentinas * '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30149799 ), 
   it would be like if venezuela tried to take aruba or cura\u00e7ao from the netherlands simply because they are closer to the islands than amsterdam is perfect example . 
  cristina fernandez de kirchner regularly went on the record at the un saying that her government 's policy was that the people living there ( who have been british for a little under 200 yrs ) had no rights to stay, 
  ok , like i said , triggered : the residents were never argentinian . 
  we did n't capture the islands from argentina - there were no aboriginal peoples subjugated or colonised - the falkland islands were uninhabited when they were discovered by european sailors in the 1700s . 
  britain , france and spain quarrelled over them for a few years in the early 1800s , culminating with a small spanish military garrison being forced off the islands by british soldiers ( no civilians or permanent residents , literally just a limited spanish military outpost on some empty islands ) . 
  after that , we founded some towns , with red phone boxes , driving on the left , god save the queen , you get the idea . 
  the only permanent residents have been british people for the past ~ 200 yrs , with all of our culture , and strong ties to the mainland . 
  argentina did n't exist at this point . 
  basically , it 's a standalone place with very little to do with argentina . 
  in fact , it 's 300 miles off the argentine coast - and their * only * claim is `` well they 're nearby our coast '' . 
  by that logic , japan should be ` returned ' to the russians , alaska to canada , the uk to france ... it gets really stupid really quickly . 
  3,000 people have lived there for something like six generations now , and their culture is as british as any of our islands closer to home . 
  islanders were asked in a referendum in 2013 whether they wanted to be solely a british territory , or explore power-sharing with argentina . 
  99.7 % voted against any form of negotiations . 
  some people in argentina believe that population has no rights to their homeland because they were `` implanted '' , and should be removed by force . 
  for what , exactly ?
