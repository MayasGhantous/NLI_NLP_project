  i prefer it to normal milk , and not just because i 'm lactose intolerant . 
  i genuinely prefer the taste * and * it takes so much longer to go off . 
  people have been referring to almond milk as almond milk since at least 1300 . 
  i * know * i 've seen roman references to it , but i ca n't find it . 
  [ look at this 14th century french cookbook ] ( http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26567/26567-h/26567-h.htm ) : et se voulez faire orge monde entier sans broyer mettes du laict damande laict d'amande is almond milk . 
  it is a generic term .

  or `` milk of magnesia '', 
  eh , when you 're lactose intolerant it does n't matter . 
  i 'm not sure i like this . 
  almond milk has been called almond milk for centuries . 
  at this point the term is entrenched . 
  i love art deco , but i also love french neo-byzantine, 
  dhul is `` entry '' from \u062f\u062e\u0648\u0644 , mhux is `` not '' from \u0645\u0634 also , most signs in arabic would translate `` no entry '' to '' \u0645\u0645\u0646\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u062e\u0648\u0644 '', 
  at their age , it 's impossible anyway . 
  frankly , it would have been difficult event when he was 18 , she 'd be 42ish . 
  but the same is true for the red states and democrat voters ... 
  i have n't decided how i feel about this law , but i 've never had a problem with my dick getting squeezed when i sit . 
  and i do n't normally cross my legs on public transport because it takes up too much forward space . 
  labour is unlikely to achieve a majority because of the snp . 
  all people need to do is deny the tories the majority . 
  and whether that means labour or libdem depends where you vote . 
  the students are n't able to congregate in bigger crowds because they 're on holiday . 
  if you 're using adblocker , they 're not getting money anyway . 
  so not really sure why it 's any worse than the current situation . 
  mage , no ? 
  we have magi too . 
  that happened to be the result this time . 
  that did n't happen with bernie sanders or jean-luc melenchon . 
  irrelevant . 
  the small parties remaining small is one of the consequences of giving big parties more airtime . 
  actually , that makes sense now that i see alexandria too . 
  what 's the significance of the city names on the ceiling ? 
  i see washington , paris , berlin , byzantium and florence . 
  not enough gold . 
  yes , but there 's something poetic about the elysee . 
  for all it 's pomp , it also now represents the promotion of the common man over the nobility . 
  a common man chosen to lead by common people to become the most powerful man in the country , no less . 
  he was british born . 
  it 's a meme . 
  a joke on `` this is why trump won '' . 
  somebody needs to revisit sex-ed ... 
  thinking babies can be made that way ... , 
  cher is the same in french . 
  it 's a very annoying part of the lgbt community , as a gay man myself . 
  bi-erasure is a prevalent and serious phenomenon . 
  they 've still stuck on to the left hand side of the board so not a total disaster . 
  the song was actually a fan favourite . 
  also , alma was the best looking female performer that night by far . 
  and i say that as a gay man . 
  i got a lot of schadenfreude from it . 
  i 'm not a very patriotic man haha, 
  i genuinely laughed when the televotes pushed france above the uk and pushed the uk back to the right hand side . 
  austria got 0 . 
  france has been marianne since the revolution . 
  britannia was britain during the empire . 
  uncle sam iirc only eclipsed columbia as america 's personification around wwi . 
  / r/le _ canard of course . 
  you did n't see the poll numbers then . 
  macron was always at least 10 % ahead of melenchon in the 2nd round, 
  `` i am the state '' is a very famous quote , even in english . 
  if only obama were still around . 
  he 's such a handsome dude . 
  i love the republic . 
  hillary won with 62 % in ca, 
  the polls were wrong !, 
  in macron 's favour !, 
  tbf , you did n't need to count the votes to know hillary won california . 
  it was never not going to go for her . 
  the 20 point gap was based on 75ish percent turnout . 
  dropping 5 percent entirely of macron voters is still only going to get her to 43 % . 
  because they do n't think she 's rotten . 
  it 's simple ... clearly she must have done something to make people like her , people she 's certainly amassed her fair share of fans . 
  she 's had diehard supporters ( not saying he is ) since her days as first lady . 
  they are n't going to fade the same way gore 's , mccain 's or romney 's did . 
  the guy was was n't originally muslim ... 
  he converted . 
  nyc utterly despises trump . 
  but hillary is big in her own right . 
  during he primaries , bernie had a lot of trouble trying to find somewhere to hold a rally in harlem , because the neighbourhood is so pro clinton that nobody wanted to rent him a room . 
  harlem was also one of the few african american areas in the country that did n't swing to obama during the '08 primaries . 
  it 's ugly , smelly and irritating and it gets everywhere . 
  i do n't recall any of the dnc ones being fake . 
  but the podesta ones were riddled with edits . 
  emails missing sections to make them look more incriminating etc, 
  france today is only about 3x bigger . 
  in the middle ages , france 's population was around 20 million . 
  around the time of the revolution it was 30 million . 
  so in 200 years , it 's only just doubled . 
  i think england 's increased by a factor of 11 in the same 200 years . 
  the philippines is around 103m right now . 
  which is 12.4 x larger than it was 100 years ago . 
  5th grade facts often have a way of turning out to be ... 
  incorrect . 
  trump lost all three debates against clinton . 
  by margins of at least 10 % in debate polls . 
  this has great meme potential . 
  it 's the split between the `` old left '' and the `` new left '' . 
  it needed to happen , neither side seem to be happy with the current arrangement . 
  if the sun 's not out , 25c is jumper weather .
