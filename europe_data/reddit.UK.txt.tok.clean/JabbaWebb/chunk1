  gay-hitler-druggy-american-devil . 
  hmm . 
  yup , sounds about right . 
  cheers mate, 
  nope , i have never seen that law before : / i am ( i was going to say ` saddened but no i feel more pissed off ) with my country and this law , especially even more so considering that homosexuality was only decriminalised in the ' 60 's . 
  but i 've got to ask - surely these sort of acts become catalysts ? 
  or at least motivators for as you say - less controversial gay rights activists to take stand ? 
  i do agree with you that on the big scale it is a pointless gesture but when trying to dislodge something like homophobic laws i guess you need to start with small gestures like this , like the belgium kissing and the swedish flags etc. 
  to merely show that there is global support for the idea , that way then it can begin to get the governments interested in actually trying to make a change . 
  or am i being young and na\u00efve ? 
  here you go : ** ingredients ** * 450g/1lb dried mixed fruit * 250g/9oz brown sugar * 300ml / 1/2 pint warm black tea * 2 tsp mixed spice * 450g/1lb self-raising flour * 1 free-range egg , beaten ** preparation method ** 1 . 
  in a large bowl soak the fruit and sugar in strained tea and leave overnight . 
  next day preheat the oven to 170c/325f/gas 3 . 
  line a 900g/2lb loaf tin with baking parchment . 
  mix the remaining ingredients into the fruit mixture and beat well . 
  pour the mixture into the loaf tin and bake the oven and bake for 1 1/2 hours or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean .

  aye i think it can be eaten as a dessert  only really tried it once ... it was * alright * . 
  i kind of assumed it was a bread because `` bara '' in welsh means ` bread ' but hey , it 's welsh so through some sort of odd national blood thingy i am proud of it .

  i do n't think it is better . 
  aye , no worries mate . 
  but turkey is an associate member of the eu as well ... 
  so , i guess , when a country in the eu starts having protests then the rest of the eu should ignore it ? 
  and nothing should be posted on / r/europe ? 
  i mean , there are riots in sweden right now , marches in the uk , spain , greece . 
  additionally , turkey is an associate member already . 
  * edit : * might i also add - these people are protesting against a government/regime . 
  what gives you the right to say ` nope . 
  we 're not gon na recognise them ' ? 
  i dare say that these are the sort of things that * should * be discussed in / r/europe - people 's liberties and rights . 
  [ turkey has been trying to be part of the eu , and as such i guess that they deserve some recognition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union ) on / r/europe, 
  well that is disappointing , someone should complain . 
  very possible mate , i pop round / r/europe from time to time and as i said - rarely see more than 1 or 2 welsh flags, 
  i 've never noticed as many welsh people on here before . 
  i am very sorry friend , i have corrected my mistake . 
  thank you for your illspent money and vote , 
  congrats denmark , well played .
