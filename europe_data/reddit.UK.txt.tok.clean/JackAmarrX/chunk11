  it was a referendum on the last 30 years , people wanted change and voted that way . 
  either the continued instability in the middle-east continuing to displace people , creating more conflict etc , or trade wars fucking the little guy by driving up the costs of every day items and services . 
  there are so many !, 
  what happened with that anyway ? 
  did the policeman just make it up ? 
  edit : oh shit the guy went to prison ? 
  make mercia viking again, 
  the only mention i can remember from history in school was that the crusades was something richard lionheart was off doing whilst king john was fucking shit up here . 
  my second name is of norse origin , i 'm blonde and my family originate from yorkshire . 
  i 'm happy under the ( likely false ) illusion that i 'm a viking . 
  ah - yes compared to poland london definitely is prohibitively expensive , especially in the booze department . 
  i do n't suppose free museums are much help when you 're up to your neck in a pub in central . 
  north of england , scotland and ireland have everything you need though and can all be done on the cheap . 
  it 's worth a look anyhow . 
  ** billions **, 
  i do n't know about the pound - it 's not something i really keep abreast of . 
  i do know it 's much cheaper if you 're converting from euros and dollars than its been for many years mind . 
  london is seen by most of the uk as you said , prohibitively expensive , northern england will as cheap as any other part of western europe generally . 
  the only thing that can rack costs up is train travel , but renting a car is straightforward and cheap if you 'd rather not . 
  as a side note , london is n't that expensive if you know where to go . 
  out of interest what made london insanely expensive for you ? 
  castles ? 
  scenery ? 
  mostly edible food ? 
  we 've got it all in the uk !, 
  with our long history of fighting each other and indeed ourselves and inability to invest in infrastructure outside the m25 we have literally billions of castles and vast tracts of rural landscape unspoiled by serviceable roads or reliable train services !, 
  we can also boast a cuisine that 's either like french but with less ingredients , or borrowed from cultures we used to own/operate/subjugate !, 
  in all seriousness , the north of england/scotland is worth a shot if you do n't mind a flight from germany . 
  lots of castles , lots of history , modern cities and national parks up the wazzoo .

  cool - cheers for answering . 
  i agree , but i suppose what i meant was that would you feel any less pride or connection to a european country that did n't have the euro , or was n't in the eu at all . 
  would/are these countries less ` european ' in your eyes ? 
  ( again this is n't a challenge , simply a friendly enquiry ), 
  not a criticism , but would n't that be more to do with the eu and the eurozone , rather than europe as a whole ? 
  african union is quite an interesting institution , and has made some strides especially in regards to security . 
  i think many parts of africa would benefit from a system similar to the eu , as the concept of a nation-state has n't really taken hold there , at least to the same extent as it has in europe . 
  depends , uk is pretty evenly split in two now so it depends who you ask ( though i think the idea that the uk is two nations has existed since the victorian period , but brexit has pushed it to front and centre ) . 
  it definitely did n't but it 's still funny . 
  london can officially become the 6th biggest french city by joining france . 
  you can give us cheap wine , hyperu and eu membership . 
  we can give you beer , fried chicken and oyster cards . 
  charge them excessive train fares and make said trains really shit to put them off coming here . 
  wait . . 
  we prefer the term ` borrowed ', 
  we snubbed the eu at first but we would have been in much sooner but de gaulle was on top form . 
  he made one of our pm 's have a nervous breakdown after he vetoed our entry for a second time after suggesting he would n't . 
  there have been a few over the past 10 years . 
  mp 's expenses : basically a lot of mp 's were putting a lot of [ questionable stuff down as expenses ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1248648/mp-expenses-shaming-389-greedy-politicians-went-far.html ) ( which are paid for by the public ) including second homes , lavish meals , cars , porn and in one case , a house for ducks . 
  basically defrauding the public purse . 
  liberal democrats break promise : in 2010 the uk could n't make its mind up on who should be the government so we had a coalition of conservatives and ( at the time ) left wing liberals , liberal democrats led by nick clegg . 
  during the election he promises to make university tuition free again , but the government , that he was deputy leader of , instead trebles it . 
  lots of students vote for him and get angry . 
  he apologises , [ people turn it into a meme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudjrz30sno ) . 
  liberal democrats lost 50 odd seats in the 2015 election . 
  pig-gate : a disgruntled tory party donor wrote a book about previous pm david cameron after he would n't let him buy a cabinet position . 
  in the book it 's suggested that at university mr cameron had an intimate and public moment with a dead pigs head . 
  most people knew it was a load of shit but it was funny to pretend it has actually happened . 
  [ lots of memes ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/020/249/879.jpg ) . 
  biggot-gate : in 2010 incumbent pm gordon brown , [ a man who looked like a tesco bag full of cold porridge ] ( http://www.un.org/news/dh/photos/large/2015/march/625890gordon_brown.jpg ) , did a meet and greet and a woman who complained to him about immigrants . 
  after he got back in his car to go to his next appointment , he said she was a biggot . 
  he had forgotten to take off his microphone and sky news picked up the comment . 
  he later apologised live on tv in some excruciating scenes . 
  was the final nail in the coffin for the one-eyed iron chancellor . 
  this morning when i bought a pint of milk on the way to work . 
  he said two contradictory things , essentially calling it both useless and important . 
  it 's hard to really form a judgement based on that . 
  i do n't think he knows how he feels about it . 
  i swear a lot , which i get from my dad . 
  my mum will tell me off if i accidentally drop a hard f or c bomb , but i think she secretly finds it just as funny as me . 
  i felt so smug about remembering the double n as well . 
  come to london . 
  you 'll be aggressively ignored . 
  stop badly conceived and ill thought through reforms that end up with greater emphasis on testing and less emphasis on education being shat out by the education department every 5 years . 
  are there any countries specifically you 're interested in seeing ? 
  the differences between germany and spain , or poland and greece make the question difficult to answer . 
  you mention nightlife , any major european city has a vibrant and diverse night scene to get stuck into . 
  if you want to keep costs down i 'd recommend you stay in central and eastern europe , in particular berlin ( germany ) , talinn ( estonia ) krakow ( poland ) , and prague ( czech republic/czechia ) . 
  i 'd recommend trying to see paris , london , rome etc though , they 're the most popular destinations for a reason . 
  i 'm a native english speaker and still get tripped up by ` specific ' and its derivations like ` specification ' and ` specifically ' - i usually give up and use another word . 
  as thus : `` that sounds spaficicly ... speficik ... spa ... sp ... sp ... spe . . spurcific ... spu ... spa . . ( swearing ) that sounds exactly like what we should be doing . '', 
  double post - please ignore, 
  reuters is a news wire , so they do n't tend to inject opinion into non-editorial content . 
  that 's where other journo 's get there news from , and other wires like ap do the same . 
  the ft is quite well regarded , and do a lot of news on europe , they tend to look mostly at market impacts but not always . 
  i 'd argue against the bbc being left wing . 
  the fact that the left rage just as hard as the right against it 's perceived bias suggests it 's doing something right . 
  in any case , reading news from a political angle other than your own is quite healthy , and makes it easier to from your own informed opinion , rather than just hardening pre-existing opinions . 
  i 'd try to avoid over indulging on one side of the argument . 
  as long as we leave afterwards . 
  we lived in a house with no walls , floors or ceiling . 
  we worked 25 hours a day with no breaks and nothing to eat but cold gravel and when we got home our dad would chop us in to little bits and dance on our graves . 
  ** luxury **, 
  uk - all my life france - i lived there for 7 months and have been on holiday there a bajillion times exactly . 
  switzerland - i lived there for three months poland , ireland , czechia , germany , spain , italy , hungary , croatia , portugal , bosnia and belgium all less than a month or two in accrued holidays . 
  i sense some goalposts being moved here . 
  none of your answers here seem to relate to anything you said in your original post . 
  i 'll leave you to it . 
  economic benefit : if a computer engineer born , educated and trained in romania gets a job for a firm in the uk , the uk gets all the benefits of his training ( tax revenue , productivity etc ) without any of the costs ( costs in education , training ) . 
  you basically ` steal ' the fruits of another countries education system .
