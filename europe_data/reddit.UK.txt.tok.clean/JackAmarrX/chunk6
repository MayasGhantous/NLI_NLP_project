  this is seen by some as a unionist/loyalist flag however . 
  the red hand a symbol of ulster , was/is used by groups like the uda so it has a difficult political connotation . 
  st patrick 's cross ( diagonal red cross on a white field ) is sometimes used , though it does n't pertain directly to northern ireland , its pretty much a royalist flag for all of ireland with connotations of the empire . 
  some people use the flag of ulster , which is a bit off because northern ireland does n't quite include all of ulster . 
  its a red cross on a yellow field with a red hand . 
  some people use the irish tricolour as well . 
  vietnamese food is pretty well established in london . 
  places like deptford and hoxton have vietnamese communities and lots of restaurants . 
  it 's not nationwide though . 
  you 're more likely to see nepalese or thai in any given town in the uk . 
  mate , boss , pal . 
  all three can be used passive aggressively/sarcasticly . 
  homebrewing is very loosely regulated in the uk . 
  most of the regulations are about selling it . 
  this is cider and beer mostly however , not your traditional moonshine . 
  were you hiding under a rock during the referendum ? 
  with the rebuilding of the hop there 's a massive opportunity to move parliament/politics out of london . 
  london can easily survive without it , and the country would probably do better if the political centre was moved further north - i.e. 
  manchester . 
  too early to tell . 
  personally i think cameron will be seen as a business as usual kind of pm and i think may will be remembered for whatever disaster kills her premiership , be it brexit or indyref related . 
  may is fucking insane but she 's not far gone enough to override the scottish parliament . 
  first the eu and now potentially scotland . 
  that 's some legacy she 's building for herself . 
  peanut butter is n't hugely popular . 
  it 's still stocked pretty much anywhere , but no where near to the extent of things like jam or marmelade or even yeast extracts like marmite or bovril .

  when i was doing a-levels ( ages 16-18 , about 10 years ago now ) we did a module on british decolonisation which was absolutely fascinating . 
  it ran from the second boer war 1899 up to hong kong in 1997 - which is obviously pretty recent . 
  tennis , rowing , cycling , rugby , athletics . 
  we 're ok at cricket . 
  we 're fucking arse at football . 
  heroic individual players , but pure sunday league pub team when it matters . 
  people expecting england to beat iceland was more surprising than iceland actually winning for me . 
  m&m world . 
  i mean , it annoys me that tourists only want to see buckingham palace and big ben , because there 's much more to see than this . 
  but why does every tourist seem to be carrying bags from the m&m world gift shop ? 
  [ brain blessed ] ( http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1736236.ece/alternates/s615/actor%20and%20adventurer%20brian%20blessed.jpg ) it 's not a rough equivalent , but it 's probably the closest thing we have . 
  wake up at 8 , brush teeth , pick up bag that i pack the night before . 
  walk to the station and get a train into town ( london ) which takes about 15 minutes . 
  normally pick up a 99p coffee on the way in . 
  get in about quarter past 9 . 
  drink my coffee as i read emails and the news . 
  day can be anything from drearily slow to pant shitting busy . 
  usually break for lunch around 1 - i make my lunches from left overs of dinner . 
  in the summer i 'll go and sit in the park but during winter i 'll either eat ` al desko ' or in the canteen . 
  normally get out of work around half 5 . 
  then depending on the day i run home , go to the gym , or meet a mate or the other half for a pint nearby . 
  normally try and keep my weekdays busy . 
  train home , pick up dinner from the super market , cook , eat , shower , film or some gaming perhaps then pack my bag and lunch for tomorrow and to bed with an audiobook at around half 11 . 
  i 'll make sure to sample more next time i 'm there, 
  a labour mp standing against the pm in his constituency did an ama during the 2015 election . 
  it was quite interesting but because of how our elections and party system works , was basically doomed to lose that particular contest . 
  nice to hear just a guy talking about why he wanted to be an mp and not having a party communications strategy obscuring their frankness none-the-less . 
  edit : found the link https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/2su16i/i_am_taking_on_uk_prime_minister_david_cameron_in/?st=izrc6fuw&amp;sh=9aaf0602, 
  fish and chips , from a chippy by the sea , preferably somewhere in the north , like whitby . 
  water or if i 'm feeling particularly fancy fizzy water with lime cordial . 
  rillettes from france . 
  why have butter on toast when you can smear on congealed salted pork ooze ? 
  the chicken variety is nasty though . 
  the second biggest party in england and the uk as a whole is the labour party , it 's not doing great right now , but it 's still head and shoulders above any other party bar the tories . 
  limestone and chlorine . 
  i 'm used to it but it means going elsewhere is like having evian on tap . 
  i work just off trafalgar square . 
  getting lunch is like a scene from 300, 
  i was talking about coldplay, 
  [ notting hill carnival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/notting_hill_carnival ) is the largest of it 's type in europe . 
  it 's essentially a west indian cultural celebration but in recent years its just a big street party in london attended by all sorts . 
  i more think of myself as being from london rather than from england . 
  uk -  london -  european, 
  i think you just have to say they ( edit : coldplay ) are shit . 
  i do all the time and think their first two albums are top notch . 
  i mean , i get what you mean but labour is still the second largest party and he won the leadership vote twice . 
  so much this . 
  as some one else mentioned , the suez crisis . 
  basically , in the mid 1950s the egyptian ruler nasser wanted to nationalise the suez canal , at that time still a major strategic shipping lane for the french and british , who still held colonies in asia . 
  they teamed up with israel to attack and seize it after other less aggressive tactics failed . 
  the invasion went swimmingly but there was a colossal diplomatic fall out . 
  immediate aftermath - ussr threatened nuclear attacks on the uk and france if they continued . 
  - usa also demanded both countries stop , and applied some hefty economic pressure to push the point - france and the uk have to pull out . 
  - british pm anthony eden resigns in disgrace . 
  long-term - many european countries which relied on the us for military guarantees were very shocked , especially germany . 
  seemed the us could not be relied upon for defence , even if the ussr threatened 2 founding nato members with a nuclear attack . 
  led to a big push for a euro-centric defence body . 
  - linked to this , france becomes very skeptical of nato and it 's allies . 
  franco-american relations never really recovered and de gaulle blamed eden for the failure . 
  france takes a step back from nato and tries to build up a european defence body instead . 
  - anglo-american relations also took a hit . 
  one of many reasons the uk did n't support the us in vietnam was because of suez . 
  - some have argued suez was the last of many nails in the coffin of the british empire , as well as basically taking the uk out of consideration as the 3rd actor in the cold war . 
  us were easily able to put tremendous economic pressure on the uk , undermining it 's status as an independent power . 
  tl ; dr british and french invade egypt . 
  france and the uk make seismic shifts in their geopolitical outlook as a result . 
  a great bunch of lads . 
  for some reason , i 've always thought that if there was an apocalypse , i 'd die in a really anti-climactic may . 
  falling down the stairs or choking on some food . 
  we 'll take any excuse for a drink . 
  there 's no major stigma here . 
  it 's half of our political dichotomy . 
  bless you .
