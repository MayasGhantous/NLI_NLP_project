or they are describing the manner of the attack . 
  but no , it 's a mass-media conspiracy to try and hide the fact that there 's terrorism despite the fact the fact that this very same mass media has plastered first the attack then his nationality and now religion all over the place . 
   only, 
  [ correct !, 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36306681 ) it 's funny how now the teflon-coated bastard 's gone from that to `` remoaners going against democracy '' , is n't it ? 
  we got a more developed eastern europe which would be able to stand economically on it 's own , producing stronger allies ( and , if you 're a anti-immigration type , less incentive to move to western europe ) ? 
  i. . . what the fuck ? 
  you do n't exist . 
  you 're a troll . 
  surely ? 
   and it was also caused by immigration in some way , because the guy who did it was mad at the leftist politicians , same with breivik . 
  you sound like an abusive lover , who , after pummelling their so , suddenly gets angry , going `` look what you made me do ! '' . 
  kind of scary people believe that shit , really . 
   also i like how you edited your link only edit i made to the post was changing a bracket so the markdown was n't broken . 
   but separatist terrorism is different than islamic terrorism since it can be stopped by some kind of compromise , look at eta , ira etc. , they all stopped . 
  the muslim terrorists will never stop . 
  and the anarchists ? 
  and the far-right nutters ? 
  and the communists ? 
  they 're not something you can compromise either . 
  are they muslim too or do they not count ? 
  there are still ira splinters that are active ( if not very ) . 
  there is also a rise in far-right groups such as - over here - national action ( decreed a terrorist group in november ) . 
   if there were just a few muslims in europe there would be no terrorism [ what ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eta_\\ ( separatist_group \\ ) ) [ the ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provisional_irish_republican_army ) [ actual ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulster_defence_force ) [ fuck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) [ are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_liberation_front_of_corsica ) [ you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/an_gof ) [ actually ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_angry_brigade ) [ on ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_greece#revolutionary_organization_17_november ) [ about , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donetsk_people%27s_republic ) [ you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_norway_attacks ) [ muppet ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_jo_cox ), 
  i really , really hope that the deaths do n't rise . 
  my condolences to everyone affected . 
  punishing an entire group over the actions of a few is ** exactly ** how we got into this mess in the first place . 
  it 's not wrong . 
  [ here 's the fn winning local elections a month after the paris attacks ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35018849 ) to give just one example .

  you definitely should n't share this . 
  look in their comment history :  . . even if it were true , what 's the problem ? 
  the eu sucks . 
  it 's destroying europe and turning it into an islamic ghetto . 
  if putin wants to stop that from happening then good for him . 
  -  why should this be everyone 's country ? 
  why does every group except white people get to have their own countries but our countries must be for everyone ? 
  -  outside of stem , western universities are mostly just seminaries for political correctness . 
  anti-white viewpoints are one of the core theological tenants of pc . 
  they 're a white nationalist . 
  they might not be explicit about it , but they are still a white nationalist . 
  thanks for your input , _ / u/marsaljosipbroztito _, 
  are they arresting them and putting them to trial or are they ignoring them because they 're scared of appearing racist ? 
  make your bloody mind up . 
  [ let 's not talk about the east and south . 
  and the reforms implemented and lessons learned are irrelevant , are they ? 
  the acid attacks ** do not mention a race in the article ** . 
  you ** can not ** conclude a certain race is doing them , because , once again , ** there is no race mentioned in the article ** . 
  you are taking a completely irrelevant article , sprinkling in some racist bollocks , and then saying `` hey look it agrees with me ! '', 
  it 's also not a new thing . 
  the word `` vitriol '' means [ both sulphuric acid _ and _ `` to attack or injure with or as if with vitriol '' . 
  ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vitriol ) , and with crackdowns on knife crime by the met , people are turning to easier stuff to get . 
  you use this stuff in secondary school labs , so it 's not like it 's difficult to get ahold of . 
  but sure , the person labelling themself as `` yugoslav '' knows more about the city i live in than i do . 
  edit : here 's an article from _ just yesterday _ showing crackdowns on these abuse gangs , this time in oxford : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-39466980, 
  so your first article is totally irrelevant ? 
  the example you 've just given now being in the past , has had people arrested , on trial , and charged , a process which is _ still _ continuing , in addition to reforms :  following the report 's publication on 4 february 2015 , pickles stated that the local authority was `` not fit for purpose '' , and announced proposals to remove its control from the councillors and give it to a team of five appointed commissioners , including one tasked specifically with looking at children 's services . 
  after the report 's publication , files relating to a current councillor and a past councillor identifying `` a number of potentially criminal matters '' were passed to the national crime agency . 
  the leader of the council , paul lakin , resigned , and members of the council cabinet also stood down . 
  [ 16 ]  on 16 february 2015 labour party leader ed miliband said that the casey report was `` deeply troubling '' , and that the leadership would `` learn the lessons '' of the scandal . 
  he said he was `` deeply sorry for what happened in rotherham and we are determined to have a fresh start , a fresh start in terms of the people of rotherham most of all . 
  the labour party did let people down in rotherham , absolutely . 
  '' [ 60 ] that 's not to say it happened and was wrong , but 2002 is closer to the berlin wall falling than today ... 
  referendums only work when you properly educate the masses and ensure that the messages spread by both sides are true . 
  for instance , while painting any old shit on the side of a bus with a wildly misleading statistic and driving it up and down the country will gain you votes , it does n't exactly lead to the most informed decision . 
  [ what 's your point ? 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/6ssgp ) also , that 's saying they 're not _ reaching trial _ which is different to being arrested . 
  also , the reasons given are victims not wanting to pursue charged or not being able to find suspects . 
   plenty of policemen in uk for example do n't arrest their compatriot islamists even when they commit a crime , if it 's against a women or a gay men . 
  you 're chatting shit mate,

   usa is a republic ( part of the reason you ca n't vote to leave ) , not a democracy you what ? 
   eu is less demographic than us , that i wo n't disagree with . 
  one of the reason why greenland left . 
  have you gone completely mad ? 
  our government 's not planned anything beyond `` we want the leftover sandwiches from the meetings '' . 
  `` we can have bendy bananas now , _ bitches . _ '', 
  people tend to realise breitbart 's a heap of shite , though . 
  with the daily mail , well , it 's the most read news website of them all ... 
   the daily fail and the sun are among the very worst examples of ~ ~ british ~ ~ journalism .
