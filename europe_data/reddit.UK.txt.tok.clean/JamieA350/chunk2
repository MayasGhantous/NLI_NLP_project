  type of thing , too . 
   what if two heterosexual men would like to marry ? 
  then ... they can ? 
  who the fuck am i to judge ? 
   both have a right to marry an opposite sex ( regardless of each 's sexual orientation ) , both are forbidden to marry the same sex ( again regardless of each 's sexual orientation ) . 
  why should we prevent two people who are able to consent from marrying ( no , `` i do n't like bummers '' is n't a reason ) ?

  sure . 
  in 2011 , 59.49 % of the uk put `` christian '' as their religion on the census , but in a 2011 yougov poll , `` 34 % of uk citizens said they believed in a god or gods . '' . 
  the term [ cultural christian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_christian ) comes to mind . 
  no clue who made the image itself . 
  quick google suggests it 's from the babadook . 
  as for the website , you probably nicked it from 9gag or some other thing like that , did n't you ? 
  be honest with us . 
  my favourite part about this is later in the film you hear that someone died in the tower . 
  then they 're stupid . 
  australia 's the mountainous one beneath germany . 
  not too sure about td , but r/conservative will ban you for mentioning the southern strategy . 
  one of their rules is explicitly `` trump supporters only '' .

  not even remotely comparable . 
  [ it 's not like the moment segregation/colonialism/etc fell everyone suddenly shot to being equal . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cycle_of_poverty ) this happens on the scale of small communities ( such as black areas in america ) and the colonised-and-further-exploited nations ( i.e almost all of africa ) . 
  i was referring to america ?

  - flag is basically romania with a shield - catalan is the official language beyond that , nothing , sadly . 
  a lot of reddit says it . 
  i thought sweden was being overrun by refugees and was 99.99 % muslim ?

  what ? 
  i wonder if the `` being slaves for 100 years then segregated for 160 '' thing has anything to do with it . 
  visors are n't glass , it counts, 
  nationality is n't ethnicity . 
  try again . 
  are the no camp abstaining because they see it as illegitimate or voting in it ( or split between the two ) ?

   the report accuses 49 members of the catholic church of carrying out the abuse between 1945 and the early 1990s .
