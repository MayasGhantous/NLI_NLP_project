  this referendum was : * illegal under both ukrainian and international law * [ used transparent voting boxes , but did not use envelopes , compromising the idea of a secret ballot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#procedure ) * [ did not have any option to remain as-was ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#choices ) * [ had observers turned away ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#osce_and_un_absence ), 
  the majority of overseas territories are either [ too small to function as countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pitcairn_islands ) or [ voted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 ) [ to ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bermudian_independence_referendum,_1995 ) [ remain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar_sovereignty_referendum,_2002 ) as they are . 
  of course , not all are right ( the bases on cyprus come to mind ) . 
  again , this does not make annexing crimea okay . 
  sure . 
  in the case of russia , georgia was 2008 and ukraine is right now . 
  on this map , sudan was 1898 and china 1860 . 
  a colonial empire in the past does n't make annexing crimea today okay . 
  aggression towards russia including `` crimea existing nearby '' and `` being georgia '' . . ? 
  fine , you win . 
  but _ vertical _ bars ... 
  france , surely ? 
  sinn fein do not take their seats . 
  mlp and farage do , but then do n't do anything despite reaping the benefits of them . 
  not comparable . 
  temporarily . 
  social democrat ? 
   free trade you are aware you 've pretty much voted to leave ( one of ? ), 
  the largest free trade markets in the world , right ? 
  please france , do n't fuck this up . 
  do n't vote her in . 
  \\  flair is nationalism for two long-gone white african republics \\  post history is full of far-right and ultra-conservative stuff \\  polls disagree with everything you say [ mfw ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bvznnzh.gif ), 
  sure they do . 
  * bring back smoking in pubs * give everyone a free bulldog * seize the means of production for red , white , and blue bunting, 
   [ he likes to shake them ] ( http://fiscalkombat.fr/ ) oh my gosh this is the best thing ever, 
  that 's the kind of ignorance you 'd expect a from random person who has n't really looked into the eu . 
  not the `` leader of the free world '' . 
  edit : a word, 
   and mlp 's campaign is hardly anti-lgbt since philippot , mlp 's main man is full on gay the two are n't mutally exclusive . 
  it 'd probably be cuter and funnier if i did n't have to live through it . 
  was n't the press or politicans on the mainland that was chatting about war with spain within a week or two of a50 being triggered ... 
  scotland 's ... still part of the uk ( for the moment ? ) . 
  let 's cross that bridge when we come to it . 
   the conservatives ' plan for a deep and special brexit * it 's red white and blue * ~ ~ 350 million for the nhs weekly ~ ~ * will mean brexit what else ? 
  speak for yourself, 
  anyone willing to adopt me and get me out of this mess ? 
  polls are n't totally accurate . 
  in america 's case they were n't far off . 
  hillary won the popular vote by a pretty solid margin . 
  however , because america uses the most backwards version ( the electoral college ) of a backwards system ( fptp ) ... 
  very strict gun control combined with crackdowns on knife crime in london . 
  sulphuric acid is used in school science labs , so it 's not the most difficult thing to get . 
  that 's an expensive toilet . 
  we do n't take well to those `` expert '' things around here . 
  _ the british people are tired of listening to them . _, 
  especially when it was the same bollocks tactics of dehumanisation and the like that lead to an mp getting murdered ... 
  [ he 's claiming it , either way ... ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/donald-trump-vows-deport-11-million-undocumented-immigrants-mexico-will-pay-wall-1579058 ), 
  i 'm glad we can have a slight bit of smugness again . 
  brexit was a massive cockup , but not like this !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gggigtjk7ma the british people are tired of * experts * ( fucking hell , how did people trust this man who looks like his own caricature ? ), 
  and denmark !, 
  there 's a joke in here about how this is because of how fucked greece is . 
  i ca n't be bothered to think it up . 
  pretty much everyone on this subreddit knows who jean-claude juncker is , you fool . 
  fucking experts . 
  the british people should be listening to pint-swigging , union jack waving , redcoat wearing bulldogs , not some bloody expert from china !, 
  i ca n't tell if you believe this nonsense or not,

  do you not remember the sopa and pipa blackout ? 
  during the referendum a lot of people voted for it : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_independence_referendum,_2014 the main party for this is the scottish national party who have all but a handful of the seats in scotland . 
  worked for us ( thanks hadrian ! ), 
  why is everything splattered in paint ? 
  those guns sure helped in the streets of derry and belfast , did n't they ? 
  what the fuck are you on about mate ? 
  there 's a joke to be made here about stockholm syndrome . 
  seems less and less so every day . 
  no we do n't . 
  i 'm not going to say we have perfect race-relations here ( toxteth and brixton come to mind ) but we do n't have our police shooting dead , well , anyone really . 
  we 'll build a wall and make the french pay for it !, 
  these days you 're thrown into prison just for saying you 're a ford cargo . 
  our royal family is always something that 's great for tourism . 
  send george and his sister i do n't know the name of off to some commonwealth country and the media print constant headlines about how adorable they are and so on . 
  you called ? 
  does everywhere have a place where everyone is meant to be a sheep-fucker ? 
  i mean , we have wales ... 
  it 's funny how people said * we must leave because appointed eurocrats * has lead to the leader of the country being appointed without any public vote ( not even a party one ! ), 
  us and brexit . 
  if it goes smoothly , it encourages more to leave . 
  if we stall it , it 'll cause tensions and problems . 
  if it fucks us over , it 'll cause issues with scotland and ni . 
  has it gone to penalties yet ?

   i once asked rupert murdoch why he was so opposed to the european union . 
  ` that 's easy , ' he replied . 
  ` when i go into downing street they do what i say ; when i go to brussels they take no notice . ',
