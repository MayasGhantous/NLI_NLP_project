hahahahaha, 
  in my school we had a very heavy emphasis on the slave trade and studied it for over a year . 
  german nationalism , unification and rise of the nazi 's are all taught extensively . 
  in scotland we also teach about the wars of independence , battle of stirling bridge and bannockburn etc. 
  civil rights movement also features, 
  as far as i am concerned , the yes campaign lost and he simply can not believe it . 
  he has been so set on one goal all of his political career and not to get it has really hit him hard . 
  he is being quite bitter now and is trying to guilt trip no voters . 
  i am not impressed, 
  salmond just ca n't deal with being defeated, 
  i believe it was , as traditionally it was more of a whole body outfit, 
  a fair few people know what clan they are from but your surname is no guarantee of being from a specific clan . 
  clan tartans were introduced in the victorian era and most people do not associate with their own tartan . 
  not at all really . 
  many clans still exist today but usually just having a meeting once a year . 
  some clans still own their own castles but most have gone into ruin or have been given to the national trust as they are too expensive to upkeep, 
  it 's just a stupid stereotype that people on facebook spout forth about, 
  in scotland we wear kilts not because we have to , but because we can,

  i was one of the contributors and i visited it quite regularly , it was quite good,

  ** how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  ** daily for 2-3 hours and about double that at the weekends ** how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  ** daily ** what country are you normally resident in ? 
  ** united kingdom ( scotland ) ** do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? 
  ) ** no ** what interests you about europe ? 
  ** diverse politics , culture and people . 
  no country is the same yet most europeans have a sense of a european identity ** what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  ** my favourite is the huge variety of topics that get posted and debated about on the sub , i discover something new every time i come here . 
  my least favourite is the frequent brigading of anyone who disagrees with majority or is of a certain nationality . 
  really annoys me how someone 's opinion can be drowned out by the crowd . 
  ** do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  ** yes , i moderate / r/funny and / r/gadgets . 
  i remove rule breaking posts , respond to mod mail and approve links on both of the subs . 
  ** why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  ** from my own experience i have enjoyed moderation duties immensely and see it as a way of giving something back to reddit . 
  ** why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  ** i do my best to be fair when responding to users or removing posts and if i am unsure about anything i always ask for a second opinion from more experience mods . 
  ** do you have any experience with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  ** i do n't ** what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  ** i think that it went wrong as such a huge news story was confined to a single thread and people felt that their opinions were n't being heard . 
  i think that we should just accept that immigration is a big deal right now and continue to allow people to post stories about it on the front page . 
  ** what 's one weakness you have ? 
  ** identifying weaknesses ** would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  ** a hundred duck sized horses , without a doubt . 
  a duck and i had a bit of an altercation when i was three , leaving me with two scars on my left hand . 
  ** what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why ** noun . 
  all of the words are nouns, 
  what if you cause yourself to crash ? 
  i am actually in orkney right now and have been to see skara brae , which is really cool . 
  unstan chambered cairn is literally five minutes walk from where i am staying and i am really looking forward to going to crawl in and explore the inside . 
  seriously , if you are interested in archaeology you have to spend some time in orkney , the islands are just packed with historical structures . 
  if i was a parent there sadly i think i may be forcd to heed their advice out of fear of what may happen to my children . 
  how ? 
  teachers were n't allowed to state their own opinion or influence others but the majority of them just did anyway and we had a couple of days where all we did in class was debate the issue . 
  i had had discussions with other people about it beforehand but it was only until the last couple of weeks where everyone seemed to be talking about it in the corridors . 
  i tended to keep my opinions quiet as i did n't really want to start an argument with anyone . 
  i live in moray . 
  the most adamant yes supporters that had multiple placards in their garden and drove around the town with saltires hanging out of their windows were mostly english . 
  i found that really strange as i would certainly never do that if i moved to england . 
  i get your point about making friends with those who hold the same opinion but to be honest most people only started to discuss it publicly on the week before the referendum at school . 
  it is very likely that more young people voted yes but i know that in my area we held a mini referendum beforehand and about 60 % said they were going to vote no . 
  this is probably in part to do with the large english influence in the area but most people i know voted no . 
  that will never be proven, 
  i think that pensioners who have a certain amount of earnings should get no state pension or at least a reduced version of this . 
  if later on they went under this threshold they could again claim a state pension , hopefully saving a lot of money from people who do n't need it . 
  hello , i am / u/jamie _ maclauchlan , i 'm from scotland and i would like to become a moderator of / r/europe do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator [ 5 ] ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox [ 6 ] ) ? 
  i have no experience with automoderator , some basic knowledge of css such as setting up flair and backgrounds and i have used mod toolbox quite a bit with the other subreddits that i moderate . 
  i would be willing to learn how to use automoderator and improve my css knowledge what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  generally from about 4-5 .30 in the afternoon and then from 7-10 in the evening . 
  i also have bacon reader on my phone so i am able to respond to messages at near enough anytime during the day . 
  what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe [ 7 ] i love being able to compare how things are in my country with other people 's . 
  i have learnt so much about other countries since joining here and it is fun to have discussions with my fellow europeans . 
  i do n't like the down vote brigading that happens sometimes and legitimate opinions get hugely negative karma scores , putting people off contributing . 
  this is of course something i would seek to improve if i was moderator . 
  what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  more discussion threads for users to be able to learn about each others culture by asking questions and interacting with people who actually live there . 
  the standard of moderation is quite good but i think there needs to be more of it so that certain opinions are n't down voted and users are n't intimidated for having a different view on a certain issue . 
  this will improve the tone of the subreddit and will encourage more people to engage in the community . 
  what would make you a good moderator ? 
  i will seek to enforce the subreddits rules , moderate fairly and will be active on reddit everyday that i can be . 
  i understand that moderators can receive abuse but i will always try to be impartial and explain any decisions that i make to anyone involved . 
  i will always seek to be a good moderator and will try my utmost to increase the quality of this subreddit . 
  not mandatory , no, 
  anywhere but britain, 
  woop woop,
