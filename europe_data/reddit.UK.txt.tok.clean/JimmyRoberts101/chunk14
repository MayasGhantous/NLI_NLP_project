  i think you are underestimating uk and france and overestimating germany and italy . 
  germany has economic power but has absolutely no global projection because of a lack of military . 
  they also have very little cultural relevance . 
  france and uk are the two strongest in the eu as they have strong militaries and can project themselves around the world . 
  they also have cultural relevance , especially the uk . 
  italy is no where near the level of these three . 
  it is in the bracket below the three european powers ( uk , france , germany ) . 
  it shares this bracket with spain , sweden , portugal , holland etc. 
  since when do women fare better in academics ? 
  i think so . 
  it will be europe or china . 
  the us is on their way out in this regard . 
  china is surging . 
  if europe can come together and adopt a better attitude to industry and innovation then it could be us . 
  the rest of the europe should strive to be more british in this regard imho . 
  dude , you 're scottish . 
  scotland is one of the most patriotic and jingostic countries going . 
  love that bit, 
  the guardian can piss right off . 
  we all know they dodge tax like there 's no tomorrow . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87xkr8z3leo this or anything else churchill . 
  this one as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soqwa73kxbs ( 3:26 specifically ) or this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g95g0vztaki makes me patriotic seeing us get one over on the french . 
  or of course this beauty https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geafpbfm3_c ( 2:03:45 for patriotism overload ), 
  again , it 's not what i want . 
  i do n't have a bone in the fight . 
  it is what all the experts and authorities say on the matter . 
  so far i have provided you with comprehensive proof i am correct but all you have done is state a random heavily politicised opinion . 
  i am ( much like everyone in the world ) open to being convinced if you can provide proof you are right . 
  but you ca n't , therefore everyone will continue refering to them as the british isles . 
  * whatever you want to tell yourself chief * i 'm not telling myself anything , i am just reading what all respected authorties say on the matter . 
  i will always trust and believe the oxford dictionary , the online dictionary and the ordanance survey website over an irate irish nationalist on the internet xd, 
  right now i think france is more relevant . 
  but the way things are going italy certainly has the potential to replace france as one of the ` big three ' of europe . 
  yes and it also seems all the facts agree with me . 
  [ have a read here ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/british-isles ) [ and here ] ( https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/2011/08/whats-the-difference-between-uk-britain-and-british-isles/ ) [ also here ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/british-isles ) to quote the oxford dictionary * ' a group of islands lying off the coast of nw europe , from which they are separated by the north sea and the english channel . 
  they include britain , ireland , the isle of man , the hebrides , the orkney islands , the shetland islands , the scilly isles , and the channel islands . 
  ' * no matter your degree of butthurt , geographical facts will remain geographical facts and schools the world over will continue teaching this correct terminology that has been in use for thousands of years . 
  facts are on my side xd keep fighting the good fight though , even though no one will listen to you, 
  * by a fat british imperialist for political reasons * you can keep being bitter and denying facts all you want xd me and the world will continue calling our wonderful islands the british isles as we have done for thousands of years . 
  my mistake , greeks not romans . 
  but my point still stands . 
  several sources from around 150 bc to ad 70 include fragments of the travel writings of the ancient greek pytheas around 320 bc , use the terms albion and ierne [ 26 ] [ 27 ] and have been described as referring to the british isles , including ireland , as the prettanic or brettanic islands ( \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 ) or as \u03b1\u1f31 \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9 , literally `` the britains '' the british isles ( originally the brettanic islands ) has been in popular use for over 2000 years . 
  a few left wing nationalists having geo-political issues with the term in the 21st century is not going to change anything . 
  just because some irish nationalists dispute the term does n't change fact . 
  the collection of islands have been reffered to as the british isles since the roman times . 
  this is not going to change now . 
  right , i am not concerned with what is currently politically correct so say or not . 
  [ read here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles ) . 
  no matter how much it annoys you , you ca n't change facts . 
  you guys are n't very talented with it though . 
  what makes this funnier is that is the official name for them xd, 
  care to elaborate ? 
  but why does locational differences in property prices make a chart of wealth per adult irrelevant ? 
  property is worth what ever people are willing to pay for it . 
  i want us to remain . 
  but let 's be honest , britain will alway be a scientific trailblazer . 
  from evolution to gravity to the big bang , it 's in our culture . 
  uk strong performer as always, 
  why does that make it not relevant ? 
  whah ? 
  uk stronk, 
  the refugees wo n't make * that * much difference . 
  sure they will give germany a bit of a boost , but they ca n't change the long term demographic forecasts of a country of 80 million . 
  it 's because france is n't very relevant, 
  * of course letting businesses treat workers poorly * that is a hugely negative view to take of enterprise and wealth creation . 
  zero hour contracts give companies the tools to employ workers for the actual workload the company has , rather than doing a big job with too few employees or a small job with too many . 
  on top of this zero hour contracts provides workers with vital experience that can then in turn lead to a full time role in the future . 
  when i was a student zero hour contracts were a god send as i could turn down paid work as it suited me depending on my university workload . 
  * why on earth would a company hire a person full-time * this is not just about one company though . 
  just because a worker does work with a company on a zero hour contracts does n't mean the worker is shackled to that company . 
  the worker can take the skills and experience they have gained and apply for other jobs as they choose . 
  i think this could be a cultural thing . 
  i 'm from the uk , we are the inventors of capitalism and it was here where the industrial revolution began . 
  we understand the net benefits of a free and liberated employment market , in my country we have seen the net benefits of this first hand . 
  it creates wealth , and sure the wealth is n't spread evenly , but in the long term everyone in the country benefits . 
  yeah , but what thatcher did was initiate long term vital change to the country . 
  the uks lowest ever unemployment rate was in 1973/74 . 
  but large parts of the country at this time were employed in outdated , enviromentally damanging and unprofitable industries . 
  these industries were kept alive by incredibly strong and efficient unions . 
  thatcher got rid of these unions and industries , much to the annoyance of large parts of the country . 
  at times she bordered on draconian in the way she went about it , but the changes needed to happen . 
  since then succesive governments have been re-building into the country we are today , by getting people into modern and profitable industries , predominatly in the service sectors . 
  this is the reason thatcher is often ranked by academics as one of the best prime ministers in british history . 
  yeah , maybe soon is an overstatement . 
  but most forecasts put british gdp exceeding german gdp in 10-15 years . 
  much of this is down to demographics . 
  britain has a young and growing population , whereas germany does n't . 
  a relative minority are zero hour . 
  but zero hour contracts are not the boogey man the left often pretends they are . 
  they are hugely beneficial to business and often act as a bridge for the unemployed to become full time employees . 
  i thought the spanish economy was going well atm ? 
  lol , that evil thatcher . 
  making necessary changes to allow our country to go from the sick man of europe to the second largest ( soon to be largest ) economy in europe . 
  how dare she . 
  i do n't assume anything , you are the one painting it as an economic wasteland where everyone is locked into their low pay job with no prospects and they ca n't change careers/jobs even if they want to . 
  0 hour contracts are vital for an economy . 
  they are hugely useful for employers and they often act as a brige for the unemployed to become the employed . 
  * what would you say a guy can do to change careers if they 're a janitor , with barely a highschool degree , from an immigrant background and with a family to support ? 
  * take evening/weekend classes and get a highschool degree , take a government loan and get a degree through evening/weekend classes or distance learning , then once earned go into the appropriate field and start paying back the government loan once you are earning over a certain amount . 
  it 's not easy , but it 's absolutely possible for anyone .
