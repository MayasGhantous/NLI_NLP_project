  it 's happening in our backyard i would agree if this article were about ukraine , but it 's not . 
  it 's 90 % about america 's increasing production due to china 's emerging economy . 
  and slightly hints at russian difficulties . 
  yup , things have really changed here . 
  perhaps more noticeably than any other already large sub . 
  i do understand that europe is tangentially related to any west-russia conflict . 
  but in the world we live in , it 's easy to make any argument that europe as a whole is somewhat affected by any global events . 
  whether that 's in the spirit of the subreddit is another question , i feel . 
  i feel as if / r/europe is becoming / r/worldnews . 
  super well explained . 
  i 'd give you gold but my bermudan reddit account has all my money . 
  too much tax i reckon . 
  i hear they 've got rid of phones in san marino since it 's annoying to hear your neighbour through the wall while you 're on the phone with him . 
  the executive and legislative branches of power are very muddled in the constitution of the united kingdom . 
  i would but i 'm scared you 'd pay me with that shit, 
  as i opened this post , my girlfriend said `` wait !, 
  what 's that picture ? '', 
  and showed me this on her instagram : http://i.imgur.com/yxucm1u.jpg, 
  that 's staggering , thank you . 
  and we did n't want av , we wanted pr . 
  yep , hence `` other political factors '' . 
  i made no mention of `` fair '' . 
  democracy is n't fair . 
  i meant for pr , but you 're quite right . 
  i agree , but ukip has its own strong areas in the east of england , but they pay extremely harshly for appealing parts of the whole of the uk , and the snp is extremely well-rewarded for only appealing to a certain part of the country . 
  the point this illustrates is that our voting system values geography far more than other political factors . 
  there are myriad other voting systems , and you 'd be hard pressed to find one as favourable of big parties as fptp . 
  it would n't be a simple transition , we need constituency reforms ( single-member districts do n't work , as you implied ) to have it work properly , but i 'd like to see a form of proportional representation . 
  not sure if a joke or not but in english we do n't quite have the grammatical propensity germans do to concatenate words , so just `` children 's names '' or less naturally `` child names '', 
  honestly , this is absolutely disgusting and is the biggest blight on our country in my eyes . 
  some choice figures : the green party gets over one million votes , representing over a tenth of labour 's total votes . 
  labour gets 228 seats . 
  instead of getting a tenth of that amount , the green party gets one seat . 
  one single seat . 
  one 228th of labour with 10 % of their vote . 
  meanwhile , the snp gets half of ukip 's votes , and 56 times as many seats . 
  counting every party from ukip down reveals that around 5 million 200 thousand votes are represented by 2 seats . 
  that means approximately one 8th of all voters are represented by one 325th of the seats . 
  i did n't do the whole thing once in the uk , then the whole thing again in france . 
  er , nope . 
  this raises more questions than it answers . 
  i 've studied in france and the uk , france was a lot more francocentric than the uk was britannocentric . 
  well , that is the most talked about objection people have to the ttip is the isds component . 
  i do n't think people are ignorant for not having heard of isds , but it 's impossible to have an informed opinion on ttip without knowing about isds . 
  is that an english city ? 
  he says he has biscuits and tea you fuckwit, 
   want to be the leader or want to earn a few bucks ? 
  i just wan na watch my daytime dramas and absurdly difficult quiz shows in peace , really . 
  you guys even had snow this month ... 
  in april . 
  sort it out . 
  i think we got over the bulgarians and romanians pretty quickly . 
  it 's the bloody syrians now . 
  one day norway or the netherlands is gon na overtake us . 
  beethoven . 
  well , he was the viktor . 
  my dad is nearly `` living in poverty '' according to this . 
  absolutely hilarious . 
  ( he 's retired , has a pensions , no mortgage or debt and big savings ) . 
  meanwhile , somewhere like greece has a rate around a quarter of switzerland 's . 
   despite what others may say the uk is a very centrist country . 
  while i agree with you , we do have a history of redefining what `` centrist '' is , through a series of influential economists , politicians , etc. 
  in another era , it 'd be another story . 
  and the welsh enjoy it because the englishman gets caught, 
  cheaper than a taxi . 
  i 'm not defending recent uk policies , but people really do throw the word fascism around too easily . 
  i see . 
  time to convert it into a roller-coaster then , it 's already most of the way there . 
  why does it cost 500k a year to keep open ? 
  missed out on h\u00e4scht\u00e4g . 
  all lithuanians i know who are n't studying in the uk hate brits because the ones who come to your country do so for stag dos and partying . 
  you can tell they 're the shitty kind of brits straight away . 
  if they do n't drink tea , leg it . 
  [ satyrical , you say ?

  i do n't know who you 're quoting there , but i never said anything of the sort and i do not deny male rape . 
  `` in the us , more men are raped than women . 
  that 's without counting all the prison rape '' `` do you have evidence that more men than women are raped outside of the prison system in the us '' how is that different ? 
  i looked into it . 
  he 's talking about this bit of statistic-mining ( google search the stats he mentioned ... 
  i ca n't link it because automod deletes comments linking to tumblr ) which belongs in / r/badstatistics . 
  it says that the 12 month weighted percentage of `` other sexual violence  men  made to penetrate '' is the same as the 12 month weighted percentage of `` rape  women '' ignoring that the actual values are ~ 21 million vs ~ 5 million , ** and ** that the same study says just above this table : `` nearly 1 in 5 women in the united states has been raped in her lifetime ( 18.3 % ) [ and ... ] approximately 1 in 71 men in the united states ( 1.4 % ) '' even accounting for the probable relative under-reporting of male victims of rape , this is not the `` more than '' figure he 's coming out with . 
  no , but he did .

  sorry , do you have some evidence that more men than women are raped outside of the prison system in the us ? 
  ninja edit : downvoted twice within one minute for asking for evidence . 
  hmm . 
   implying europe is gay  national mascot is literally a bear, 
  that 's a great recipe for an ineffective military and a massive waste of money when nato already exists . 
  other letters might not be hard consonants , but they still often change the pronunciation of the word . 
  like mangeas is different to mangeant . 
  other times , the spelling change is just to reflect grammar . 
  like mangea to mangeas . 
  i suppose c is unusual in that it does n't form part of a verb ending , so if it forms part of a word 's spelling , it 's there to reflect pronunciation ( and etymology ) . 
  there is no mangeac . 
  it 's the same with f , for example . 
  as to why many other terminating hard consonants `` disappeared '' , you 'd need a historical linguist for someone qualified to answer that , 
  because hard c is always pronounced in french .
