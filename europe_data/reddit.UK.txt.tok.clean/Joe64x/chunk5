  it 's the same with leopold . 
  just accept it as a piece of history . 
  i can be proud of my friend achieving something without having directly contributed to it . 
  yeah , you do n't even need to simplify them for them not to make sense . 
  at the end of the day the election was won on discontent with the status quo on many levels . 
  and discontent is n't tempered by rationality . 
  that being said i appreciate that you do n't assume everyone who voted leave was just doing so because they 're braindead morons ; there has been a well-oiled campaign of disinformation that is difficult to understand if you do n't live here and difficult to accept if you do . 
  i still say it , but it different ... like in the uk you 're not expected to say hello to people you walk past in a block of flats or a hotel , but in france you are . 
  then when you go to a shop you have to say bnj/bonsoir first . 
  whereas in the uk you can still say it , but it wo n't necessarily get a response and it 's not treated as an interaction in the same way , it 's just like breaking the silence . 
  at least that 's my experience in wales , ymmv of course up north . 
  in oxford where i live during term time people are friendlier still ( but it 's still not a ritual interaction in the same way as france ) . 
  the uk seems to have a more sensible balance . 
  you wo n't get the grovelling `` have a nice day ! '', 
  all the time but you are expected to be polite and friendly . 
  tip culture is n't a very big thing so most of the time the friendliness is authentic . 
  some of us have loose leaf tea but i reserve that for special occasions . 
  the rest of the time clipper and twinings is enough for my daily fix . 
  i 'm not using a strainer and teapot thrice daily ; tea is for destressing !, 
  do n't get me wrong , i still massively prefer service culture in the uk to france , and the reputation for rudeness is deserved , but i do miss the ritual bonjours when i 'm in the uk . 
  there 's actually only one school of thought : teabag , water , milk . 
  the others are schools of mistakes . 
  same in japan . 
  do you provide slippers too ? 
  or are visitors expected to wear socks/go barefoot ? 
  this was a reverse culture shock for me . 
  going back to the uk from france and nobody returning my `` hello ! '', 
  the vast majority of french people do not call it un computer , i can assure you of that . 
  maybe kids trying to be cool/kids visiting anglophone countries do . 
  but in france people do n't talk like that . 
  that 's because l'ordi is the desktop not a laptop , which is portable/laptop/notebook etc. 
  i have no idea where you went to school but we learn modern standard french in the uk . 
  it 's a bit textbooky and formal at times but it 's not a dialect or particularly old-fashioned . 
  native english , fluent french and advanced japanese . 
  i also speak an appallingly shitty amount of finnish because my girlfriend is finnish . 
  but that 's the infinitive , 
  a lot of my friends speak welsh english . 
  it has some strange quirks : second person and first person conjugation can be replaced by third : you knows i loves you . 
  the preterite can be replaced by the past participle : i seen him coming but i did n't turn quick enough . 
  and a bunch of phrases and words : scram is a scratch from a cat . 
  cwtch is a cuddle . 
  now ( in a minute ) = soon . 
  `` see ? '', 
  is used to confirm the second person is listening : so i said to him , see , that he had better watch himself later . 
  no anglosphere represent ? 
  i think the geographical distance makes things difficult though . 
   i understand your anti-immigration stance who is `` your '' ? 
  opinion is far more heavily divided than just what you read in the press . 
  anyway i agree with the / u/kunstfr , and french society in general : personal faith/religion is fine but it 's a private thing and has no business interfering in politics or the public sphere ( beaches , for example ) . 
  i personally do n't like islam . 
  i do n't like any faith much and i like the abrahamic ones even less than the others , so it 's not something particularly against islam . 
  obviously the cultural interpretation of islam that many hold in the usual-suspect-countries is reprehensible and i 'm glad that eastern europeans tend not to go for that wahhabi bullshit . 
  other than that i do n't care what you believe if you keep it to yourself . 
  beautiful , thanks . 
  first of all i love this thread idea . 
  can i cheat and do one for japanese ? 
  since i doubt anyone else will and japanese is an astoundingly beautiful language at times . 
  i 'd nominate [ yui - namidairo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szu5c_qyw50 ) which is quite beautiful in its simplicity and almost conversational style and an * old * classic : [ kawa no nagare no youni ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kzhfehga7q ) sung by the late great hibari misora , who successfully blended traditional enka and western-style pop . 
  i 'd also nominate [ la cible ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mmt4eebwq0 ) for canadian french in memory of [ genevi\u00e8ve castr\u00e9e elverum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genevi%c3%a8ve_castr%c3%a9e ) . 
  and for my homeland , [ calon l\u00e2n ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qutbsjyn7uu ) . 
  eon is british and so is most of the cast . 
  the departed . 
  kinda ironic that it happens to be a remake of a hk film but there we go . 
  another great one is inception : both directors treat the viewer as if they were as smart as the directors themselves , which is rare in american cinema . 
  this is what happens when you have a powerful credit lobby that strongly believes americans are incapable of remembering four numbers . 
  are you in the eu ? 
  and will you be for the foreseeable future ? 
  cool thread idea op .

  i tend to miss living in strasbourg when christmas comes around . 
  they take it pretty seriously there . 
  complete with garish decorations and a pretty massive christmas market . 
  pembrokeshire in general has some great coastline . 
  i usually go near the blue lagoon which has diving and swimming spots : http://www.mayberrykayaking.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/the-blue-lagoon.jpg if you prefer to go further north then there 's portmeirion in gwynedd , modelled after italian villages : http://www.visitwales.com/~/media/0957dfd88b704d77bc39dbe1c6967a0a.ashx?as=0&amp;h=350&amp;w=1024, 
   i really like nature and the outdoors cheeky plug for the welsh coast !, 
  not as overrun as the better known tourist spots , but should have decent weather , peace and quiet and beautiful scenery , 
  i did , and mine has ipads now . 
  that 's actually one of the best ways to tell a shit school , when they prioritise stuff like that over teachers . 
  could well be . 
  honestly i 'm just surprised and nerdily excited that the reflexive pronoun works so similarly in dutch . 
  til dutch is just drunk english . 
  no one told conchita wurst that !, 
  i never knew austrians were so charming , 
  threaten to leave ... by stepping half way out of the door and letting everyone else get cold and pissed off . 
  then staying anyway . 
  or one of those baseball caps with the peak at the back ? 
  why limit it to the netherlands ? 
  the official symbol of eu to become a bicycle . 
  all in favour say aye . 
  as a brit , are n't stereotypes supposed to at least be slightly exaggerated ? 
  the philippines is apparently the most pro-american country . 
  britain has the world 's most respected `` soft power '' , particularly because of its former colonies . 
  colonialism brought great terror and pain , but also great reform and liberation . 
  in wales there are a few different systems , but most people go through a state school system where the medium of education is english , so i 'll talk about that one . 
  basically everybody has some welsh classes from infants school ( aged 6ish ) to 16 . 
  welsh is a growing language , so in a generation or so , this will be fine as there will be enough welsh speakers to go round . 
  when i was in school however , welsh speakers were spread extremely thinly , and the quality of education in most schools was appalling . 
  i can honestly say there was basically no welsh education . 
  classes were on the same topic ( talking about yourself and hobbies , school etc. ), 
  for all 10 + years of my welsh education and i came out of school 99 % illiterate in welsh .
