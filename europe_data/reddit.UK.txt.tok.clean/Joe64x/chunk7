   dutch very impressive  . 
  seriously though his french and english are very good . 
  it 's not that well known here but our deputy prime minister , nick clegg , is a cunning linguist : [ dutch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vzmmh1geau#t=100 ) [ french ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrk5uysjua ) [ spanish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cypvkvklfk8 ) [ english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudjrz30sno ) also apparently speaks german , but i have n't found much evidence of it . 
  in the news last month : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29426733, 
  continentals usually have different words for ground floors and first floors . 
  french has rez-de-chauss\u00e9e which is like `` floor at the walking level '' type thing . 
  for anyone as confused as i was for a second : american first floor = ground floor . 
  ah do n't worry i got downvoted too . 
  if so hope you enjoy it as much as i enjoyed catalonia , beautiful country . 
  sweden says stuff now ? 
  mostly shadows , but also because the sandstone it 's made from is n't cleanable without damaging it . 
  nah i totally understand what you mean . 
  and you could be right . 
  still not my particular preference but i can appreciate it from that sense . 
  i think you 're right . 
  checks and balances are important in many more ways than people realise . 
  that 's why two party systems come up again and again with `` democracy '' ; there always has to be someone big enough to counter the opposition . 
  your link does n't work for me , [ here 's one that does ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/strasbourg_cathedral_exterior_-_diliff.jpg ) it 's a beautiful landmark at night , since it 's faintly illuminated and towers above everything else in the city . 
  also , greetings from strasbourg !, 
  i loved the sagrada familia till i went there . 
  maybe it 's because i 'm welsh but it does n't feel like a castle or palace in any sense i recognise ; looks a bit disney to me . 
  my nominations are [ milan cathedral ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/45726799.jpg ) ( i might 've said cologne cathedral if you had n't already ) . 
  and my favourite in the uk might be [ culzean castle ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=culzean+castle&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=beltvmbke8kqabhggfaf&amp;ved=0cakq_auoag&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=585 ) in scotland , although [ the palace of westminster ] ( http://www.britain-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/westminster-palace-01.gif ) is stunning too . 
  in wales , if i 'm banned from nominating the millennium stadium for its atmosphere , i 'll mention something a lot less conventional , the [ * eglwys bach y mor * ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/aerial_view_of_st_cwyfan's_church.jpg ) , the `` little church on the sea '' , which is accessible by foot when the tide is low , and dates from the thirteenth century . 
  thank you , i 've read up on it some more now . 
  so it turns out france does have an extradition treaty with the states and often uses it , but it became some fetishised cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among the french political/artistic class to defy it in polanski 's case . 
  honestly the amount of high-profile support he got is pretty worrying . 
  at least 70 % of french people were in favour of him being extradited , though . 
  what a peculiar case . 
  ah i did n't spot tigra 's flair , it all makes sense now , thank you . 
  can someone fill me in on a few details ? 
  essentially why he is n't extradited from france , where he lives ? 
  why issue an extradition request while he 's in poland ? 
  i do n't get it ? 
  ah yeah get that all the time in the minor league baseball . 
  ( i do n't know how to american ) . 
  bu-but ... what about simo hayha ? 
  i do n't think b\u00f6rk is halal !, 
  you 're welcome to your opinion but please do n't express it in a way that 'd get you punched in the mouth in real life . 
  you hear that ? 
  that 's the sound of confused continentals :d, 
  thanks !, 
  i see you , hidden dutchman, 
  what if i told you it 's a `` dutch '' company now ... do you hate it yet , swede ? 
  that 's actually mentioned in the article . 
  although i think ikea is in reddit 's bad books at the moment for tax evasion . 
  it 's pretty much a direct quotation from the grauniad , dry your eyes m8 . 
   `` vors '' ( american russian mafia ) can you expand a little , please ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  i have only met and spoken to one guy from georgia , which was when i was in high school . 
  so my questions are based on that hilarious time in my life : * are you all ridiculously well built teenagers ? 
  like seriously huge ? 
  ( although quite short ) * do you really have some sort of tradition of making people sit on champagne bottles or something i ca n't really remember ? 
  * are you all extroverted enough to frighten british schoolchildren , but friendly enough to assuage those fears without much effort ? 
  * do you have any idea why this guy 's tongue was really cut up ? 
  or lewis hamilton ... yeahhh british nationalism so convincing, 
  c'mon alex you should 've got that one . 
  all these vowels are overwhelming , give me words like twyndyllyngs any day . 
  that pizza was all over the news here and i never realised it had such an interesting story behind it , thanks !, 
  bunnies are cute , but we have n't eat them much since the 1950s ( awful story to look up if you 're interested ) . 
  i 've seen it work first hand in grottos . 
  there is little difference in my mind between decorations and actual reindeer . 
  yeah they 're really not domestic toys !, 
  but that 's the first thing people think of here , which is why we do n't eat them . 
  reindeer farms would look pretty cool though . 
  are you / u/gradual _ swede 's alter ego ? 
  we think of them as cute little santa pets . 
  although we do have reindeer in the uk too , it 's just not popular and it 's eaten as a `` wonder what it tastes like '' type thing . 
  i remember seeing diced reindeer on sale at lidl last winter . 
  i found it pretty hilarious that lidl decided to promote christmas spirit by grinding up rudolph in a blender . 
  bless you all . 
  temporary diversion , i can hear ewe calling for me !, 
  edit : i fucked up a sheep joke . 
  i am ashamed of myself . 
  polish people are hardworking , helped us immeasurably throughout history , and then came to britain just to get slagged off . 
  i say fuck that , thank you poland . 
  ireland , some of you may hate britain but the fact that some of you do n't shows that people can put aside history and just be humans to one another . 
  your contribution to literature , language and humour is far too often overlooked . 
  and your accents make me hibernosexual . 
  france , i live here and your food is great , so is your language . 
  and bonjour/bonsoir are better than hello . 
  germany has what i 've discovered to be a totally undeserved reputation for a lack of humour . 
  i suppose sitting on piles of money * can * make you happy . 
  greece , i 'm sorry . 
  your people do n't deserve what 's happened to your country . 
  i think it was expertly proved that no one is worse than the english . 
  undercover transylvanian printers ran out of black ink . 
  ca n't really blame them . 
  y' all got any of them links ? 
  seeing as it 's not / u/savannahjeff, 
  being concerned about immigration has no bearing on the veracity of the holocaust , though . 
  maybe i 'm weird but i do n't really mind seeing absolute bullshit . 
  as long as we all get to talk about it and educate each other , i 'd rather people say it here than anywhere people ca n't tell them not to be such a twat . 
  can someone fill me in on who the hell savannahjeff is ? 
  more than that : the uk and other rich economies pay what can be thought of as a membership fee to the open market . 
  the advantages of free trade between the states are worth many times the costs of membership in straight financial terms . 
  in other words the net contribution stats that show the uk paying in more than it gets does n't take into account the whole point of the eu 's open market . 
  they are n't real-people-reactions so much as political-figure-in-political-climate reactions . 
  anything less from cameron would go down very badly right now ( because of the recent trend towards euroscepticisim in the uk that cameron 's trying to appeal to ) . 
  itt : people who do n't know the uk 's gdp .
