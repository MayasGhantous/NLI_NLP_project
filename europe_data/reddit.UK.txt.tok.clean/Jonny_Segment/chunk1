i agree . 
  so do i. 
  anyone else ? 
  if it was a bald eagle , i think it would have been more ... dramatic . 
  i get the impression we in the uk are very far removed from news of political happenings in europe . 
  rightly or wrongly , our media thinks british people are both uninterested and fed up with the eu and simply does n't report on it . 
  actually , that 's not quite fair . 
  a chart of uk news articles on europe containing the words `` interference '' or `` legislation '' would look quite different from the ones in this article . 
  most of our media would have us believe that the eu is taking all our money and doing nothing for us except dictating the shape of our bananas and forcing us to give luxury houses to terrorists . 
  i think of myself as being fairly well-informed about world affairs , but i had n't heard of jean-claude juncker until cameron started complaining about him . 
  i wish there was more coverage of eu matters in our media , but apparently i 'm in the minority . 
   submitted 9 hours ago by / u/kim _ jongun er ... is this an ambition of yours , mr kim ? 
  hmm ... 
  i guess i can kind of see the logic of that ... 
  yeah , it generally does n't take many eviscerations for an issue to become quite contentious . 
  hmm , now you mention it ... we do have such a problem with obesity in this country . 
  maybe that 's the solution . 
  bears . 
  i do n't know , i quite like the way that we britons can go for a walk anywhere in the country without the risk of being mauled to death by bears . 
  four more beers !, 
  that is unbelievably relevant . 
  i know him as georg v. bushsson . 
  the ambulance one is the right height to be seen in a car 's rear-view mirror . 
  the police one is too low and if you 're already in a car then it does n't matter enormously if you ca n't understand what a taxi 's sign says . 
  i vote we stick with ambulance . 
  what could be simpler than describing the vehicle as a ` walking ' ? 
  so there 's a chance that if you drink too much , they might instantly make you president of the united states ? 
  ^ ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ ^ four ^ ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ beers !, 
  is the prosecution submitting this gallery as evidence ? 
  why is slovakia famous ? 
  come on now , you knew from the start that it was going to be controversial . 
  well to be fair , how do you think bob the apple-eater got his nickname ? 
  the english one is [ staithes ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=staithes&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;prmd=minv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjb3vu-vybmahxdqq4khdebb3mq_auiccgc&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=559&amp;dpr=1.5 ), 
   iceland yep , checks out . 
   l do n't like this \u222a ca n't trick me , that 's not a real ` i ' !, 
  i do n't know why that 's so hilarious to me . 
  probably because it 's a funny thing to say . 
  ^ ^ ^ funny ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ true . 
  way ahead of you . 
  i think the fourth word went in my eye . 
   apologies , it should be ` should ' not ` shall . ', 
  worrying either way , but that makes an awful lot of difference . 
  what you wrote is probably fine really . 
  maybe you could have said it was written ` phonetically ' , but perhaps there 's no meaningful difference in putting that . 
  i was just hoping to read some ipa , 
  \u00f0\u00e6t \u026az n\u0252t f\u0259n\u025bt\u026aks . 
  you mean , like , satellites ? 
  you may have gone a bit too deep with the metaphor . 
  [ damn it . 
  well this made me laugh . 
  which is very welcome , because we 're completely screwed . 
  marxism does differentiate between state-ownership ( nationalisation ) and social-ownership ( socialisation ) . 
  i honestly do n't know about other forms of communism , so you may well be right about them , 
   in communism all means of production belong to the state the means of production are not * owned * by anybody , they are shared by the people . 
  well , in theoretical communism anyway . 
  * top of the line in utility sports * * unexplained fires are a matter for the courts !, 
  someone with ` satire ' in their username makes a comment about satire ? 
  damn , that 's / r/bestof material right there . 
  fair points . 
  in retrospect , i did n't mean to suggest that the american way is ridiculous/stupid/dangerous and the european way is best . 
  the only thing i 'd strongly disagree with is this :  the duty of a government is to do the ebay for the citizens if i want to sell a few old dvds , i sure as hell do n't want government interference . 
  they 'd probably set the but it now price way too low . 
  oh i know , and i did n't mean to be disparaging ( although some people have taken it like that , which is my fault for using the words i did ) . 
  as a general point , politics in the us is a lot more emotive and partisan than it is in the uk . 
  you get much more excited about politicians than we do , whether it 's trump or obama or bush or anyone . 
  and that 's not good or bad , just interesting . 
  true , but the examples of royal ceremonies were put to me in the sense of , ` you think our ceremonies are weird ? 
  what about yours ? ' . 
  yes , they 're weird too . 
   you 're like a full blown alcoholic criticizing a guy who is having a glass of wine at dinner . 
  i 'm more like a teetotal guy who lives in a hotel where some of the guests enjoy drinking wine , and i 'm visiting another hotel where the entire dining room is full of people drinking wine and being very vocal about how much they are enjoying the wine and crying about how good it is . 
  it 's fine , enjoy your wine . 
  but i do n't see what 's so good about wine . 
  that 's now ~ ~ three ~ ~ four americans that seem to think that just because i 'm british i 'm also a monarchist . 
  in the uk , we are able to disagree with elements of how our country operates . 
  yes . 
  sorry , yes , i do feel the same about the obama inauguration . 
  and i know ` weird ' and ` creepy ' have similar meanings , but ` creepy ' does specifically mean unpleasant . 
  i did n't say ` creepy ' . 
  i largely agree with you about royal ceremonies . 
  and i 'm not defending royal ceremonies , but presidential inaugurations are on a much larger scale , and therefore more noteworthy . 
  i was mainly talking about the lead up to the speech , all the choral singing and euphoric crowds . 
  i 'm not very familiar with how other european countries do things , but the way americans feel about their highest elected officials is just so alien to me as a brit . 
  we get a new prime minister ( granted , not a head of state ) , and it 's just like , ` meh , whatever , what 's for tea ? ' . 
  i do n't really mean to say one way is better than another ( though i probably did imply it ) . 
  it 's just strange . 
  is anyone else watching this and thinking , ` this is so goddamn weird ' ? 
  it 's like a ceremony of some enormous religious cult . 
  i thought/hoped there was maybe something more to it . 
  i 've been saying ` mozzarella ' to myself in a range of accents while looking for a pun but i 'm still not sure what the joke is . 
  well if you put it like that , i suppose browsing reddit is ` improving my proofreading ' , 
  apologies if your flair is meant to be ironic , but if you genuinely want your english corrected :  why ** are ** bulgaria and moldova ~ ~ are ~ ~ `` more red '' than the others ? 
  i have absolutely no idea . 
  if someone could actually explain , that would be great . 
  i 'm no expert on tolkienism , but do n't elves think themselves better than the rest of middle earth and tend to distance themselves from what 's going on there ? 
  that fits us pretty well . 
  then we have the constant threat and brooding menace biding its time in the faraway lands beyond the mountains ... 
  not russia ? 
  interesting , we may well be a month or two away from something very similar here in the uk . 
  that 's interesting and everything , but are you going to finish that platter or what ?
