and so they fought with the free syrian army and not isis ... 
  so does that mean we are 0 % ? 
  as a briton , whenever i look at these kind of maps i feel like homer in the `` kamp krusty '' episode . 
  * do n't be the boy , do n't be the boy ... 
  i 'm english and i live in sweden . 
  i think your country is one of the most wonderful places in europe , but it 's nice to hear that you enjoy the uk also !, 
  gothenberg : cool guys and fishers called glen ? 
  ah very interesting , thanks for clarifying !, 
  i would guess that people are better at reporting crimes in ireland and that this affects the crime rate , though i 'm not sure if these maps account for this . 
  i know the ons in the uk tries to estimate unreported crimes also . 
  also , some countries may count certain breaches of the law as a crime whereas others do not . 
  life in the nordics !, 
  oh dear now that i look at it , it obviously was a joke . 
  i guess i left my sense of humor at home today ... 
  well i see what you 're saying but it is n't really true . 
  we have adopted lots of french words into our language though . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  i think you may have confused ` scots ' and ` scottish gaelic ' which are two different languages . 
  still it 's a great start !, 
  phew , just about made it !, 
  the statement i refer to is the implied irony , not the fact that thousands of british people retire to spain . 
  perhaps the word was an unfortunately broad term . 
  i get your point , but in order to point out the irony , you never the less had use a broad statement about the uk . 
  btw i did n't for a minute think that you actually thought these people represented the uk , i justed wanted to register my digust !, 
  these idiots do not represent the british people . 
  is n't the whole point of ` the city ' to sell these financial services to the super-rich of the word ? 
  i agree with you , why would they ever give up money printing schemes such as these ? 
  i 'm reminded of what the late george carlin once said ; `` it 's a big club ... and you ai n't in it . ', 
  [ how i felt coming into this thread ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_-3wecpwg&amp;t=0m51s ), 
  * oof * , right in the national pride . 
  this is just my experience , so maybe still anecdotal , but at my ( pretty average ) school we visited the menin gate and thiepval cemetery among others and also some of the german cemeteries including langemark . 
  nah , i genuinely think that the uk would n't have been the same world power without things like the scottish enlightenment . 
  btw i 'm also pro union . 
  but what about all the awesome stuff we did together ? 
  i uh ... well yes i suppose we also have pork . 
  there , now you know how to say ` hello ' . 
  [ finland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjvfglsctjy&amp;t=0m5s ), 
  as an emotionally repressed brit , this it hard for me to admit . 
  this thread made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside ... 
  i 'm not crying ... 
  ` looks like they 're drinking tea again ... ', 
  haha !, 
  of course in a comment about correct english i made a typo !, 
  i was thinking ` we had noticed ' , i 'm not sure if ` we did ' can be contracted to ` we 'd ' . 
  actually both of those are acceptable . 
  dutch people never fail to supervise me with their fluency !, 
  c'mon finland , we have whisky !, 
  ^ ^ for ^ ^ now ^ ^ at ^ ^ least, 
  the uk does n't need to fail in order for the eu to still be attractive , it 's a huge trade bloc . 
  it may even be that the uk leaving was unavoidable in the long term . 
  we were always a reluctant member , hence ( to put it mildly ) the resentment in your comment . 
  i 'm not sure what the outcome will be but it 's possible that the uk leaving ( at least for now ) may be for the betterment of both parties . 
  i saw ~ ~ norwich ~ ~ cambridge and bath in there too . 
  i 'm not sure why we are doing stuff like this when we should be winning favour with the rest of the eu ... 
  who 's ` they ' ? 
  all brits ? 
   the proposals , which are subject to consultation , have also been questioned from within the conservative party . 
  lord finkelstein , the tory peer , told the bbc it was a `` misstep '' , while tory mp neil carmichael , chairman of the house of commons education select committee , said the policy was `` unsettling '' and would `` drive people , business and compassion out of british society and should not be pursued any further '' . 
  well i certainly hope this silly idea comes round to bite the government in the arse . 
  is just it me , or do these market ` shocks ' only seem to manifest themselves when we all collectively decide to panic ? 
  look at me ... we are the baddies now . 
  wait what ? 
  ` how is that not someone 's facking thing ? ', 
  no not really , they are some of the best neighbors you could ask for . 
  here 's hoping this was n't a racially motivated attack , although ( disappointingly ) it probably was . 
  what 's wrong with sweden ? 
  dude , i do n't agree with a lot of what israel does in palestine but to say that they are entirely to blame is lacking a little perspective . 
  gloves with it ? 
  ah good to see brum on reddit . 
  it 's no florence or granada but i think england 's second city deserves a bit more love , especially from other britons !, 
  well to be even more pedantic ( sorry ! ), 
  it would make it a double negative : * i do * ** not ** * see * ** nothing ** * wrong with those ... * would therefore mean * i do see * ** something ** * wrong with those ... * but loads of native speaker make this mistake all the time . 
  please do n't hate me . 
  who are you ? 
  and where 's my horse ? 
  but that does n't sell newspapers dammit !, 
  this is a survey of the british public , not the political class !, 
  or are they in on it too ? 
  oh come on dude , take that tin foil hat off . 
  also i do n't think brexit was about the dissolution of the eu !, 
  u wot m8 ? 
  i whole heartedly agree , however i think i 've managed to find it : http://www.eva.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eva_arvio_onnellinen_suomi_260716.pdf ... it is in finnish though !, 
  i do n't know if you ever visited northern ireland during those times but i can tell you that it is not something the people living there would ever want to see again . 
  only if they 're outside the eu . 
  do n't worry , we probably donated them . 
  well cpg grey stated that it was merely speculation , so he already admits that no-one is really sure of what will happen next . 
  he then continues to say that if the uk had a ` full brexit ' ( which he puts at a 15 % chance ) then there is a 97 % chance that scotland leaves the uk . 
  should scotland leave the uk then under this scenario there is a following 45 % chance that northern ireland also leaves the uk . 
  i short he 's saying that the likelihood of these events occurring is dependant upon the preceding events . 
  er . . you 're welcome ? 
  do n't worry dude i got that you were joking , and i 'm glad that you 're bringing a bit of humour to these threads as i 'm finding the whole situation rather depressing !, 
  non of the pro-leave parties ever proposed ` throwing out the polish ' as a result of a leave win . 
  i understand you are upset by the poor treatment of your countrymen ( an act i find shameful and embarrassing ) but i assure you the british public are just as upset about this . 
  does anyone know why germany is always loads cheaper than almost anywhere else in western europe ? 
  * blushes *, 
  is this tiergarten ? 
  visited a couple of years ago , now my favorite city park . 
  cheers bud !, 
  we gon na need it !, 
  hey do n't worry pal it 's still gunna be there !,
