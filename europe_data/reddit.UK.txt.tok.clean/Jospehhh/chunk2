  just a short train ride away !,

  come on man , the bbc is a perhaps one of the best international news institutions . 
  we just also have a lot of crap to balance it out :d, 
  from the bbc article on the same subject :  a subsidiary office will be opened in brussels with the intention that it will be operational for the january 1 renewal season in 2019 . 
  he was 1 out of 78 representatives , he just made more headlines than the other 77 . 
  farage \u2260 uk, 
  you should see it as an opportunity to wash your hands anyway . 
  it 's not a bad thing to have clean hands ... 
  not just the logos , but they won a [ design award ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/govuk-wins-design-of-the-year-2013 ) in 2013 . 
  i think that he was actually using danish/norwegian . 
  the swish for million is million :d, 
  i like helsinki , dodging trams is thrilling . 
  a deceptively peaceful start to the day !, 
  would domestic trips still cover trips to a different a property still owned by the same individual ? 
  yes that would be my reasoning , and also conversely it explains why england would not make a good member of the nordic council even though they share more heritage . 
  i 'm not sure why scotland is considered more of a nordic nation than england ( aside from politically ) on this sub . 
  when compared to england , scotland had relatively little [ nordic settlement ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/viking_expansion#/media/file%3aviking_expansion.svg ) . 
  not saying that they would n't make a good member of the nordic council though . 
  well , swedes seem to prefer to stay at home . 
  from my experience they all seem to go to \u00d6land ( or their respective summer houses ) in the summer !, 
  we however , do both !, 
  hey , we may be drunken yobs !, 
  and yeah we may piss in the gutters !, 
  but we are n't ... well we are n't , wait what was that third thing you said ? 
  wealth-equal , not income-equal . 
  i would imagine income inequality is higher in the uk than in france still . 
  i remember when i first saw this film , very odd but i thoroughly enjoyed it . 
  the fall ( 2006 ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_fall_ ( 2006_film ), 
  i think most people agree with you on that one !, 
  i had a feeling the results were a bit iffy but i thought posting it would produce an interesting discussion !, 
  yeah , it is just people 's opinions . 
  interestingly the us fell quite a few places this year , perhaps indicating a change in the rest of the world 's perception . 
  yeah i think the results are more about perception than anything else , so take it with a grain of salt !, 
  exactly , and thanks for lending us a king !, 
  1667 worst year of my life .

  ` look at me , look at me !, 
  we are the immigrants now ! ', 
  top work northern ireland . 
  hey , be nice !, 
  spot !, 
  with prevailing wind directions , should n't it be the other way around ? 
  would n't english nationalists want an independent england ? 
  in what sense ? 
  wales is a modern country . 
  is it the architecture ? 
  personally i love the old mix of architecture we have in the u.k. 
  i would like to hear your opinion though !, 
  well ... this comment section went about as well as it could have : /, 
  me too pal ( though i 'm not so sure about may ) . 
  i 'd like to think that , even though we 're leaving , most of us want a strong and successful eu as it would be beneficially for both parties . 
  ` the eu should be less reliant on the us for protection ' . 
  uk suggests increasing defense spending . 
  ` quiet you american puppet ! ', 
  props for being a gent there pal . 
  whoa there lad , insult our food or our physical appearance all you want but you leave the beer out of it !, 
  oh well then that sucks :(, 
  pretty sure that it 's part of cern which i do n't think is part of the eu . 
  probably not much therefore but i could be wrong . 
  is n't it [ malbrock ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malbork_castle ) ? 
  edit : same place but marienburg is the german name , my bad !, 
  there is , shall we say , a friendly amount of banter between the two nations ... 
  well sandi * is * danish, 
  let 's hope then some sensible agreement can be reached without both sides getting vengeful . 
  good luck fellas !, 
  crickey that is worrying then . 
  fingers crossed things go better than expected : /, 
  yeah , currently the difference is too vast for a freedom of movement style deal . 
  i would want to start with canada , australia and new zealand and then work from there . 
  an interesting point there , thanks for explaining . 
  if i may ask , what do you think the future relationship between the uk and roi will look like after brexit ? 
  are you hopeful or worried for the future ? 
  hahaha swedone was great !, 
  oof , right in the cellar cooled best bitter !, 
  well i 'm not saying it does n't happen , just not that it 's really commonplace or considered even remotely acceptable . 
  i could be wrong though , it 's just that this article in particular seemed a bit misleading as it was mostly about swedes concerned with their right to live in the uk , and yet they went with the title ` swedish minister ` shocked ' by xenophobia ... ' . 
  and as a brit living in sweden , i can only think of good things to say about swedes and sweden in general !, 
  i dunno man , that whole article seems a little like hyperbole/nonsense to me . 
  was it his jacket that interfered with the tasers i wonder ? 
  fair point there , ca n't argue that . 
  while i agree overall , i think that one could argue that the regimes you mention ( including british company rule in india ) often employed the use of violence as a means of control and therefore did not truly represent ` peace ' in it 's broadest sense . 
  this applies especially to periods such as the great leap forward was more like a purge than true peace . 
  maybe clement atlee should n't have appeased hitler , though i 'm not sure this would be clearly better than trying for peace as it led to war anyway . 
  but even in those worse off places , was peace the main thing that what was wrong with them ? 
  yes the quote is rather broad , and so it can really only be interpreted in the sense that peace , overall , is much more preferable to war . 
  [ er ... no it is n't ?

  ` there never was a good war or bad peace ' . 
  angels ? 
  or winged hussars ? 
  jesus , is n't war just the stupidest thing you 've ever heard of . 
  is that frued in the window ? 
  lol wtf uk . 
  now gib karma pls, 
  but once we 're at sea our cock can piss proudly into the wind !, 
  i would say check out edinburgh . 
  top city and a really well regarded university . 
  plus no fees for eu students like yourself !,
