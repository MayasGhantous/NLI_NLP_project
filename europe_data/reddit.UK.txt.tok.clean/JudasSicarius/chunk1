saint-marcellin and saint-f\u00e9licien might be my favourite cheeses of all time !, 
  though there are so many fantastic french cheeses it 's hard to decide . 
  oh really ? 
  what felt unsafe to you about marrakech ? 
  i 'm curious because i 've been planning on going there on holiday . 
  i think it 's used for tablet too !, 
  at least my flatmate used some for the tablet he made , which turned out shite , so maybe it is n't meant to be used . 
  [ no it is n't . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32451429 )  can i vote if i 've been drinking ? 
   yes . 
  polling station staff can not refuse a voter simply because they are drunk or under the influence of drugs . 
  only if the voter is disruptive will they be asked to return when they have sobered up . 
  `` there are ( or were ) christians living in all these beleaguered countries . 
  how many christian suicide bombers have there been ? 
  where are the pakistani , iraqi , syrian , egyptian , and palestinian christians who are blowing themselves up in crowds of noncombatants ? 
  have there been any ? 
  i 'm guessing there must have been a few , but the muslim supply of such people is apparently inexhaustible . 
  in every case , we 're talking about the same people , speaking same language , living in the same places , enduring same material deprivation . 
  in fact , the christians of the middle east have it worse . 
  they 've not only suffered the legacy of colonialism , they 've been hounded out of their countries and often killed outright by their muslim neighbors -- and they still have n't organized themselves into a death cult . 
  what 's the difference that makes the difference ? 
  religion . 
  we can also look outside the muslim world to see that injustice and inequality rarely produces this kind of extraordinarily destructive behavior . 
  many countries in latin america have legitimate grievances against the u.s. where are the guatemalan suicide bombers ? 
  where are the cherokee suicide bombers , for that matter ? 
  if oppression were enough , the tibetans should have been practicing suicidal terrorism against the chinese for decades . 
  instead , they practice self -- immolation , for reasons that are totally understandable within the context of their own religious beliefs . 
  again , specific beliefs matter , and we deny this at our peril . 
  if the behavior of muslim suicide bombers should tell us anything , it 's that certain people really do believe in martyrdom . 
  let me be very clear about this : i 'm not talking about all ( or even most ) muslims -- i 'm talking about jihadists . 
  but all jihadists are muslim . 
  if even 1 percent of the world 's muslims are potential jihadists , we have a terrible problem on our hands . 
  i 'm not sure how we deal with 16 million aspiring martyrs -- but lying to ourselves about the nature of the problem does n't seem like the best strategy . '', 
  - [ sam harris ] ( http://www.salon.com/2015/11/25/harris_and_illing_correspondence/ ), 
  it just is n't including eastern europe . 
  you have parties like [ attack ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/attack_ ( political_party \\ ) ) in bulgaria and [ svoboda ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/svoboda_ ( political_party \\ ) ) in ukraine . 
  that 's absolutely awful and my thought go out to the victims and their families but there 's collateral damage in every war . 
  much like there is collateral damage in the allied airstrikes on syria despite civilians not being the target . 
  tak are not a pkk group , they are a rival group that splintered from the pkk due to their disagreement with pkk policies . 
  they thought the pkk were too conciliatory towards the turkish government . 
  one of the main differences between the pkk and the tak is the tak have no problem with attacking turkish civilian targets , whereas the pkk targets the turkish state . 
   men can already decide not to have children no they ca n't , which is why this law is necessary . 
  oh fucking hell , must immigration be brought up in literally every thread in / r/europe no matter whether it 's at all relevant ? 
  i had never heard of it referred to as carnival before !, 
  oh okay , i have heard of it then !, 
  i had always referred to it as lent . 
  well that 's very true , but it turns out i had heard of it . 
  i just knew it as lent . 
  i was born and raised catholic and i 've never even heard of carnival . 
  definitely agree with that , i was in t\u0103rnovo in september and it made me absolutely fall in love with bulgaria !, 
  probably because they 're a socialist party in name only . 
  maajid nawaz ( founder of a counter-extremist think tank ) is one , though he is a former islamist himself . 
  it 's a lebanese newspaper ... 
  i 'm so glad morris dancing exists because it gave us [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfndkuiipck ) sketch . 
  by zooming in , it 's a high resolution photo . 
  yet the text on the page is clearly french . 
  then why is the text in french ? 
   the uk is a bigger trading partner for them than europe is . 
  the same used to be true for ireland . 
  just because that 's the way things are now does n't mean it can not be changed in the future . 
   i 've been converted from a staunch no to a strong yes . 
  same here , and i know a few other people that have made a similar switch . 
  actually the [ new-right \\ ( nouvelle droite \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nouvelle_droite ) is one subsection of the alt-right . 
  iranian people actually look a lot more european compared to other ethnic groups in the middle east . 
  it 's understandable for there to be confusion in the heat of the moment . 
   mix with about half a can of mayonnaise . 
  i threw up a little in my mouth . 
  the most widely-read newspapers in the uk absolutely had a pro-brexit bias , if not an outright right-leaning bias . 
   isis claims every attack asap now that 's not actually true . 
  there is a lot of nuance to how isis claim attacks . 
  nice for example took a day and a half to be claimed , this is likely because isis were waiting to ascertain whether bouhlel was linked to them as it appeared he had no prior contact with isis ( in syria ) . 
  contrast this with the normandy attack ( claimed within 3 hours ) , isis claimed this quickly as they had prior knowledge of the attackers link to them . 
  the normandy attackers had sent videos to isis 's amaq press/propaganda wing in advance of the attack . 
  you can read more about the various nuances of isis 's claims [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/26/when-isis-claims-terrorist-attacks-its-worth-reading-closely/?tid=sm_tw ), 
  as time goes on the number of non-islamist rebels is dwindling . 
  al-nusra front ( al-qaeda 's franchise in syria ) has worked hard at bringing many of the rebel groups under their sphere of influence . 
  this came to a head in late 2014 when [ nusra fought with moderate factions of the fsa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-nusra_front\u2013srf/hazzm_movement_conflict ) in the north ( the fsa and nusra had been and continued to cooperate in the south during this time . ), 
  as current estimates stand , nusra and ahrar al-sham ( the largest rebel group after the fsa ) combined have as many fighters as the fsa ( 35,000 ) . 
  my ex-girlfriends dad was killed by a neighbour with a machete , the culprit was a white brit . 
  this is actually quite surprising , it is very rare for a terrorist attack in europe to be carried out by a shia muslim . 
  i 'd actually assume it was not religiously motivated due to a ) him being iranian and likely shiite . 
  and b ) him committing suicide . 
  suicide is very distinct from suicide bombing in radical islam and absolutely unacceptable . 
  the problem is that the kurds are not a unified entity but hold many political ideologies ranging from the far-left ( syria and turkey ) to the conservative right ( iraq ) . 
  this makes supporting the kurds as a whole fairly inviable . 
   people like him and gaddafi were assholes but their worst enemies were islamists and the like . 
  that is just utter bullshit . 
  saddam and gaddafi were huge sponsors of terrorism outwith their own borders . 
  same with assad who was sponsoring terror groups who fought against coalition forces in iraq . 
  croatia looks lovely !, 
  i think i 'm skipping it this year though , it seems more expensive than most of the other balkan countries and i 'm on a tight budget . 
  as an alternative i might do coastal montenegro . 
  yeah i can only see this situation working out well for the balkans . 
  i myself am planning a trip around some of them in august . 
  the digraphs are exactly what throw me off !, 
  though it 's probably just a case of having to get used to it . 
  as a foreigner i much prefer cyrillic . 
  i find serbo-croatian using latin script confusing , whereas reading/pronouncing words from cyrillic is much easier . 
  yeah i was quite surprised that bulgaria was n't on the list , the bulgarian wines i 've had were really fantastic .
