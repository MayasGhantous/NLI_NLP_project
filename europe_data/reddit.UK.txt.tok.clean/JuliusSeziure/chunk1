ill say this , it 's incredible . 
  game of thrones is by far the best show i 've ever watched . 
  it gets really good , and that 's saying something considering how amazing it was in season 1 . 
  to be fair have you seen what the night king can do ? 
  does n't matter if it lasted a second or a year it happened . 
   eu map lost all credibility here , even though you had none to begin with . 
  btw , username checks out . 
  you are correct , ill change it to the updated version . 
  [ police confirmed there were three separate explosions near the coach , bursting the vehicle 's windscreen and injuring one player , identified as defender marc bartra .

  just to update - [ police confirmed there were three separate explosions near the coach , bursting the vehicle 's windscreen and injuring one player , identified as defender marc bartra .

  every year i always feel slightly optimistic that australia gives us 12 points for old times sake . 
  then i realize that our entry was so shockingly shit they would n't want to embarrass themselves by doing so . 
  because we always send the x-factor rejects , and insist on giving them a boring ballad to sing . 
  i think we may be the only competing nation to hate our entry every year . 
  the only reason i still watch it is because graham norton 's commentary is by far better than any other broadcaster . 
  that was a bit harsh ... :(, 
  ca n't wait to see the amount of points we get at eurovision this year . 
  think we may be the first in history to get a negative score . 
  especially on r/europe ever since we voted to leave :(, 
  to be fair , the caribbean has better weather , i would n't mind if we attached jet engines to the east coast and rocketed off there . 
   british people still think they 're special my mum does n't lie . 
  just saw an image of istanbul under snow . 
  looks incredible . 
  one day a year , they join europe to be able to participate in eurovision . 
  [ proof ] ( https://gyazo.com/8dfc8db7c3ffc034f8f4ae08d41ee066 ), 
  i know that it is commonly used as jokes on eu4 . 
  but it is * also * used a lot here . 
  you only have to look at a few controversial posts to see it for yourself . 
  it looks like italy is about to launch sicily to south america . 
  from what i gathered ( over reddit atleast ) , there are a lot of people who are still bitter about being under the control of the ottomans for a long period of time . 
  hence why you always see some crazy idiots at the bottom of posts spamming `` remove kebab '' `` lets retake constantinople '' etc etc. 
  people seem to alter facts to fit their agendas and bias . 
  if two people have mild or severe autism , they are both classed as being autistic , irrelevant of the severity of it . 
  just because only part of turkey is in europe , does n't mean it is n't classed as european . 
   but yes , you are right , it is partially in europe that is what i said ... 
  i do n't quite get that analogy . 
  but yes , you are right , it is partially in europe , aswell as asia . 
  therefore meaning it is european . 
  well that 's because australia is ** also ** european . 
  please refer to a map of earth . 
  eurasia = europe + asia . 
  thus it is european . 
  it 's not that hard . 
  western turkey is very similar culturally to greece ( from what i 've seen ) . 
  i ca n't speak for the east . 
  but cities like izmir in turkey could easily be * mistaken * to be european . 
  they were a big player in europe . 
  world war 1 itself shows that . 
  a large number of people under their control were european though . 
  they did n't all just get up and leave when the ottomans came . 
  that 's why modern day turkey is a huge melting pot of different ethnic groups . 
  the west is generally more european , and you 're likely to find people who you would see and consider to be european . 
  whereas the east , you 'd see a lot of people you 'd consider asian/arab/persian etc. 
  pretty much this . 
  i always see the same question hovering around , as if it changes every other week . 
  then again , if people put their emotions/bias to one side the answer would never change . 
  ( such as people still bitter over the ottoman empire ), 
  i honestly do n't understand how anyone could 've claimed they had removed the word easter . 
  it was plastered all over their posters/site . 
  does nigel farage embarrassing us ( the uk ) in the european parliament by calling them ` the mafia ' count ? 
  also , the church of england attacked cadbury for * removing * the word easter from chocolate eggs ( even though they did n't ) , leading to theresa may condemning it whilst on a trip to saudi arabia , where they chop peoples heads off . 
  i 've visited them in real life . 
  something about the sky scrapers there having odd shapes . 
  looks amazing from a distance though , especially on the other side of the city across the aegean . 
  in my short time on this earth i 've visited many european nations . 
  it 's been fun being able to travel visa-free , i hope we would still able to do so post-brexit . 
  i also sometimes wonder if the uk could potentially rejoin in the future , considering us , the younger generation , voted heavily in favour of remaining in the eu . 
  well i guess the * only benefit * of brexit would be that he ca n't embarrass us anymore at the european parliament . 
  ( sadly for the wrong reason in my opinion ), 
  i know many turks who despise erdogan . 
  its a real shame seeing what he is doing to turkey , considering the stature of their founder , ataturk . 
  it kind of embarrasses me when nigel farage stands up in front of the european parliament and insults them , such as calling them the mafia . 
  i will always support and champion freedom of speech , but there is a time and a place . 
  all he seems to do now is go to the ep to insult other meps and leave a sour taste in their mouths about britain . 
  completely agree with what you said . 
  it felt at times after brexit as if brits were n't welcome ( obviously i know this is n't the case ) . 
  its as if people forgot that half of britain voted to remain . 
  london ( where i 'm from ) voted in majority to remain , as did many other parts of the country . 
  it 's almost become certain that those who carry out terror attacks are known to the security services of the countries in which they are carried out . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  i just do n't see why people refuse to realize this will make our goods and services less competitive . 
  it really will hurt us if we are out of the single market . 
  i think access to it should be the priority for our pm . 
  yep . 
  i know , the rhetoric she is setting out that `` no deal '' is better than a `` bad deal '' is complete nonsense . 
  no deal = bad deal and if we do get no deal , its obvious who will be blamed for it . 
  i think the irony of the whole situation is boris johnson recently coming out and saying that eu immigration will continue after brexit , because if that 's the case , whats the point in brexit ? 
  i got the feeling the main argument leave were giving ** was ** immigration . 
  i 'd be interested to see the general opinion once a deal has been decided . 
  i still hope that we 'd be able to get some sort of deal giving us access to the single market . 
  i believe no deal would be a horrible conclusion to brexit . 
  really would 've preferred if we stayed in and worked with other member states to improve the union for the better , rather than leaving . 
  and british companies that rely on exporting will suffer if we leave the single market due to tariffs imposed on their goods , making them less competitive . 
  i understand the eu itself is n't perfect and needs work , but surely you can see the benefits it gives to the united kingdom , by being a member of the largest trading bloc ? 
  the eu is one of our biggest trading partners . 
  access to the single market makes it easier for us to trade with them . 
  access to the single market ? 
  a few people i know who dislike the eu ( and hence voted in favour of brexit ) tend to have nostalgic views of the `` good old days '' .
