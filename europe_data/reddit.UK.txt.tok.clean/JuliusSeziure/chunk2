  i personally really like the eu and supported remaining in it . 
  it has its faults but i think the benefits heavily outweigh them . 
  anyone with any basic knowledge of biology knows that the main argument against vaccination ( causing autism ) is false . 
  it 's not hurting you , it 's hurting your children and their future . 
  get them vaccinated . 
  i believe the queen owns most of the swans in the united kingdom . 
  that comment section is something else . 
  to be fair he has n't called us nazis , * yet * . 
  no we ca n't . 
  although its almost become rhetoric for us to look at them in a bad light due to recent events , we seem to forget what they actually do . 
  turkey has nearly 3 million syrian refugees , far more than any of us , when in reality , they have as much responsibility as we do , as well as taking back the refugees * we do n't want * . 
  they also have a very important geopolitical location , and whether some of us like it or not , are a part of europe , geographically and historically . 
  having a turkey that works positively with the rest of europe rather than isolating them , creating more tension , is only a good thing . 
  however , this requires erdogans compliance aswell ( so no more `` you 're a nazi ! '', 
  claims ) . 
  i know its a very unpopular opinion to have here , but if we can get erdogan to get onboard and try to cool down the recent hostilities , there is no reason we why ca n't work together for the greater good of europe and generally the world  have a nice day . 
  pretty much . 
   all 78 crew aboard the liman were safely evacuated , the turkish coastal authority said in a statement ( in turkish ) on its website . 
  welcome to r/europe, 
  we all know why it was downvoted , does n't fit the subreddits agenda , 
  yeah its mental . 
  i thought we passed the point of judging people by their appearance . 
  you only have to look at the comments on posts related to turkey/russia/brexit to see the hypocrisy . 
  every nation has their fair share of idiots to be fair . 
  but i think it makes you a bigger idiot to assume all people from a country are represented by them . 
  it 's a shame people are so clouded by emotion they fail to remember that . 
  but i guess maybe in time it will cool back down . 
  honestly , i ca n't speak for the germans , i do n't know how immigration works there , or if people stick to their own communities or join existing multi-ethnic ones , but in the uk , there really isnt a problem with turkish integration . 
  to be honest , when i see a post like this , im not even surprised anymore when i read the comments . 
  its gone that far , it 's almost become normal now to expect it here . 
  i do n't know what european society you are referring to , but they integrated really well here . 
  did you know boris johnson has turkish roots ? 
  it 's not a single post though is it ? 
  just search turkey in r/europe and look at all the comments . 
  fair point . 
  this . 
  anyone who denies it is just lying to further their agenda aka `` remove kebab '', 
  does n't matter if its a blade of grass or a mountain . 
  just because you dont agree with the politics does n't mean you can change the geography . 
  the turkish government _ does not _ represent all turks , which was shown in the referendum . 
  stop the bashing . 
  since when did morcov1 of reddit decide the geography of a country ? 
  whether you like it or not , part of it is in europe . 
  it does n't just suddenly all fuck off into the middle east because you disagree with their politics . 
  i have n't met many turkish cypriots , just mainly turks , all from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds . 
  my point was never about that , my point was i keep seeing people generalizing about turks on reddit ever since the referendum , talking about them as one group with one mentality . 
  that is wrong . 
  that does n't really answer my question , but the people who commit these attacks ** did not immigrate illegally ** ( or their parents rather ) . 
  so how do we deal with that ? 
  how do you send back people who were born there ? 
  most of the terror attackers were born in the country they committed the attack in . 
  turks here voted 81 % no , so i do n't think its a `` european '' problem . 
  just one for individual countries . 
  lets try _ not _ to band all turks together again ( seeing as its become pretty common here ) , 
  it 's exactly like that . 
  it 's incredibly unreasonable , just look at these comments . 
  honestly it 's just incredibly toxic now . 
  look at some of these posts . 
  it was clear why they were posted , and the comments are just as bad , if not worse . 
  it 's as if we 've suddenly lost all our values because we didnt get the result we wanted . 
  i didnt get the result i wanted in brexit , i didnt go around the streets calling leave voters fucking backwards and giving them shit , i just respected the fact they had their own opinion and got on with my life . 
  the comments that are starting to become more common here are nothing short of crass now . 
  i 've been to turkey . 
  it 's absolutely ** nothing ** like the middle east and north africa . 
  for a start , a majority of the women i saw there did not wear a headscarf , and you could easily mistake it for somewhere like greece . 
  however , sadly due to the referendum , and people 's ignorance/bias , people are portraying it is a saudi arabia v2 .0 here , and just bashing on anyone who identifies as a turk . 
  just look at some of the top comments , `` good riddance '' . 
  it 's clear all they read was the bloody title !, 
  i 'd read comments on here that were basically just derogatory and rude , but '' _ it was fine because brexit is stupid so the british are also stupid and this is what they deserve _ '' . 
  well atleast , that 's what i understood from all the hate . 
  it was very awful for me when we voted for brexit ( i supported remain ) , and it made me feel very unwelcome here , so i guess you can say that is why i am slightly sympathetic towards the turks who are getting similar treatment now . 
  yep , i definitely understand some aspects of peoples thoughts here . 
  for example when brexit was voted for , i 'd say we got more than our fair share of bashing here , but you did come across the odd comment that you 'd think `` well yeah , i can kinda see that way of thinking about it '' . 
  ** but really , it 's just becoming tedious . 
  ** for example , how many more posts are we going to have on turkey , with the typical `` fuck them '' comments and mentality ? 
  i get it , the vast majority of us did not receive the outcome we wanted in the referendum there , but at the end of the day , this is turkey it will be effecting , not us ( well not directly atleast ) . 
  people seem to forget 49 % of people ( probably higher if we exclude fraud ) did n't want this . 
  81 % of turks here in the uk did n't want it . 
  yet due to our utter and complete * hatred * towards the turkish government right now , we seem to be as a group , banding all turkish people along with it . 
  just troll through these comments , its basically people saying `` good , let them fuck off '' kinda thing , just because of the vote . 
  im all up for friendly debate , but it is neither friendly nor a debate at this point . 
  just one big circlejerk of people hating on things they dont agree with . 
  totally agree . 
  truth be said , it 's one of the main reasons i 've become a less frequent reader of r/europe . 
  i respect people have their opinions , but recently the bashing towards certain groups has been getting out of hand . 
  i long for the day literally fuck all that is controversial happens in europe so we can get back to friendly discussion rather than `` well fuck them '' kinda posts . 
  ( and i thought we got it bad because of brexit , imagine being russian/turkish here lol . 
  on another note , anyone who feels the same , r/askeurope is incredibly more friendly and * tolerant * for anyone that is interested ), 
  pretty much summed it up . 
  i do n't know how to take this but i got erdo\u011fan . 
  ^ actually ^ got ^ rutte, 
  i do n't recall it ever being so . 
  to be fair , if we get evicted from eurovision this year , we 'd still somehow end up with more points than if we were actually competing . 
  was the song really that bad ? 
  both sets of fans just as guilty . 
  this is n't a one sided affair . 
   just look at cyrpus i do n't get this bit . 
  ataturk was long dead when this occurred . 
  what has he got anything to do with turkey 's invasion of cyprus ? 
  was n't it in response to greece 's attempt to annex the island ?
