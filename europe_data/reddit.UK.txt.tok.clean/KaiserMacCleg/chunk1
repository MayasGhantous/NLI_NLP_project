deservedly . 
  even in english , both w and y are considered to be [ semivowels ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semivowel ) . 
  y is often employed to represent what are unambiguous vowel sounds , as in * my * , * myth * , * hymn * , and * rhythm * . 
  w is similarly employed to represent certain dipthongs , as in * bow * , * cow * , and indeed , * vowel * , though it is not used to represent whole vowel sounds in its own right , except in welsh loanwords . 
  i 'd be the first to agree that welsh orthography is screwed up ( largely , it must be said , as a result of the choices of a certain [ english printer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christopher_barker_%28printer%29 ) who first set to type william morgan 's welsh bible in the sixteenth century ) , but really , using the letters w and y to represent vowel sounds should not be all that mystifying to an english speaker . 
  welsh has seven vowels . 
  if anything it 's english that 's a bit short . 
   w and y are vowels in welsh . 
  w sounds like english `` p ** u ** t '' , unless accented - \u0174 sounds like `` z ** oo ** m '' . 
  y is a bit weird as its pronunciation can change dependent on its position within a word . 
  sometimes it sounds like `` s ** ee ** '' and sometimes it sounds like '' ** a ** bout '' . 
  the title of this post is pronounced : `` deeth guyl dew-ee hap-is paub '' where the * au * of * paub * sounds like the * ou * of * around * . 
  a few things . 
  1 ) western britain and ireland are anything but dry - in fact , they 're infamous for being extremely wet . 
  there 's not much groundwater in those areas because most of the rainfall becomes surface runoff . 
  as such , those areas generally draw their water from lakes and rivers rather than boreholes . 
  2 ) the celtic languages quite happily survived the roman empire , and were the most widespread spoken languages everywhere in britain after the legions ' withdrawal . 
  their retreat to the west began when germanic-speaking peoples - the precursors of the english - became dominant in the east after the roman empire 's fall . 
  you are right to draw the connection , though . 
  i 'd say the most important factor in the current distribution of the celtic languages is geology . 
  the oldest , most resistant rocks in britain and ireland ( which also happen to be mostly impermeable ) are to the west and north , and consequentially , that 's also where you 'll find our most rugged landscapes . 
  those landscapes served as bulwarks for the celtic-speaking britons while the anglo-saxons , and later the normans , advanced across the low-lying plains of england . 
  ermm , yep , we did . 
  to the extent that pennsylvania was almost called `` new wales '' . 
  the real reason is that ignorance breeds ignorance . 
  comparatively few americans knew much about wales in the first place , so comparatively few bothered to find out about it . 
  most of the time , yes . 
  in those instances where it acts as a consonant , however ( eg . 
  * cywir * ) , it is pronounced the same as an english w . the map is broadly correct , it just lacks a bit of context . 
  i suspect you 've got a better idea than i do there !, 
  i 've always thought that a uk without scotland would pose something of an identity crisis for your ulster scots , but perhaps i 'm being overly simplistic . 
  not in the foreseeable future . 
  plaid cymru tend to poll around 20 - 30 % of the vote in assembly elections , and their vote share has fallen over the last few terms to a low of 19 % in 2011 ( in my view , primarily due to lack of exposure but also due to the absence of charismatic leadership ) . 
  in the longer term , it could certainly happen . 
  wales is n't innately less nationalistic than scotland is - in fact , as recently as 1999 , plaid cymru secured a larger proportion of the vote in wales than the snp did in scotland . 
  if scotland leaves ( and in my view , it will , sooner or later ) , then i do n't think wales will be that far behind . 
   europe seems less like a geographic region , which is what it is , no , it really is n't . 
  europe 's boundaries have been defined over the centuries as much by politics , culture and religion as they have by geography . 
  they are in many respects as arbitrary as national boundaries . 
  the only geographically honest approach would be to conclude that europe should not be considered a continent at all : eurasia ( or even afro-eurasia ) is the true continent . 
   i have heard of other definitions but i have n't heard of one where cyprus is included and turkey is excluded . 
  i just gave you two in my above post which are every bit as valid as the one you offer from wikipedia . 
  one , from the bbc , includes both cyprus and turkey in its definition of europe . 
  the other , from the cia 's world factbook , [ includes only cyprus ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/wfbext/region_eur.html ) . 
  what about the greek islands in the aegean ? 
  many , such as lesbos , samos and rhodes , are quite clearly parts of anatolia , geographically speaking , and yet i know of no definitions of europe that would place them outside of it . 
  europe really is closer to being a cool kids club than it is a continent . 
  i am familiar with the situation . 
  the snp are certainly going to surge in terms of westminster mps this year , but 50 + mps is an overly optimistic prediction . 
  here is the most recent full-scale scottish poll for the general election :  snp 45 % ( +4 )  labour 29 % ( -2 )  conservatives 14 % ( n/c )  ukip 4 % ( -3 )  liberal democrats 4 % ( +1 )  greens 2 % ( +1 ) on a uniform swing , this gives 46 snp mps , 12 labour and 1 lib dem . 
  the unionist parties can reasonably hope that the result will not be quite as bad as that , as well , due to strong local candidates and incumbency effects offsetting part of the national swing ( for example , with charles kennedy in ross , skye and lochaber ) . 
  regardless , the snp * will * be the thrid largest party in the parliament , and they * will * wield an enormous amount of influence . 
  one thing they will not use that influence to secure , however , is another referendum , at least in the initial negotiations after the election . 
  regardless , westminster is n't the important institution when it comes to the holding of another referendum . 
  holyrood is . 
  that was perhaps the most significant effect of the edinburgh agreement : there can now be no argument that there is a legal route to independence , and that route is via a plebiscite that can be called for by the scottish parliament . 
  whether another one is held will not be decided in the house of commons but in the debating chamber of the scottish parliament . 
  another snp majority is far from assured in holyrood . 
  the party undeniably remains at the height of its popularity , but remember that it must fight against an electoral system that was purposely designed to avoid absolute majorities . 
  it managed it once , but it 's far from certain that it will happen again . 
  a pro-independence majority , however - including the green party - is more likely . 
  i agree that the snp will be in a very strong position , going forward , but i still believe that a second referendum in the next five years is impossible without a ) a pro-independence majority in holyrood and b ) a game-changing event , such as a vote for brexit . 
  in the event of : a ) another snp majority ( or at least a pro-independence majority , split between the snp and the greens ) in the scottish parliament after 2016 and b ) a vote to leave the eu in a uk-wide referendum i think it 's pretty certain another independence referendum would be held in pretty short order . 
  the tough part would be securing another majority , however . 
  that 's hardly a universal view . 
  many definitions of europe include cyprus , such as those given , for example , by the [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17217956 ) and the [ cia ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cy.html ) . 
  europe is not defined by geography alone . 
  it 's not a true continent , which is why definitions of its extent sometimes disagree . 
   england and france are not really a great deal better than ireland or wales ... 
  they 're not any better . 
  ireland , england and wales can all beat each other on a good day - they 're pretty much on a par . 
  france is demonstrably worse than all three . 
  i do n't trust the tories . 
  i do n't trust labour . 
  i do n't trust the british state or the westminster system . 
  nor do i particularly trust the european union . 
  but i * do * believe that it has been a moderating influence on the decidedly neo-liberal doggerel coming out of westminster for the past fourty years . 
  it 's not just a healthy dislike of the tory party that leads me to my grudging vote to remain , and a reading of my posts beyond the word `` tory '' would have made that clear . 
  the median wage in the us was $ 28,851.21 ( after tax ) in 2014 [ according to the office for social security ] ( https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/central.html ) . 
  that 's equivalent to # 20,295.03 . 
  the median wage in the uk was # 19,500 ( after tax ) in 2013-14 , [ according to hmrc ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/percentile-points-for-total-income-before-and-after-tax-1992-to-2011 ) . 
  so not only is the differential in us - uk pay completely irrelevant to any debate on the eu , it 's also rather unimpressive . 
  i quite agree it 's desperate , and that it has n't been the most successful policy of the british left . 
  the eu has hardly proven a vehicle for workers ' rights . 
  but at the same time , i * do n't * trust my government . 
  not in the slightest . 
  moreover , i would not be able to place any trust in * any * of the governments that have held the reins over the last 37 years * at the very least * . 
  i am not moved to vote for an exit when i hear that the government would like to take us out of the human rights act because it got in the way of deporting abu qatada . 
  i am not moved to vote for an exit when the government seeks to restrict one of the fundamental cornerstones of democracy : the right to strike . 
  i am not moved to vote for an exit when considering the utter contempt for democracy shown by both the main parties in westminster , in refusing to countenance electoral reform or reform of the house of lords over a period lasting decades . 
  many of the same problems plague the european union . 
  there is the same contempt for democracy . 
  the same adherence to neo-liberal dogma . 
  and yet , for all that , the much-maligned bureaucracy and lawmaking of europe has provided something of a moderating effect on the right-wing tendencies of our own governments . 
  i would be loathe to relinquish that in favour of misplaced trust in a narrow ruling class that has rarely held the best interests of the wider population at heart . 
  that 's the only reason i 'm voting to stay in . 
  i have serious doubts about the eu , particularly its undemocratic tendencies ( the concentration of powers with the commission and council of ministers rather than the parliament ; the very worrying suspension of democracy in greece ) , but they are as nothing compared to my absolute certainty that a tory-dominated uk set adrift in the mid atlantic would be a very bad thing for your average worker . 
  ahem . 
  the artillery is being fired blind - turkey does n't have any spotters within syria calling in the attacks . 
  they 're just shelling towns and villages which the sdf control .
