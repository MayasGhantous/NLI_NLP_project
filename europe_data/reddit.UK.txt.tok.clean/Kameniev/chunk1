that was exceptional , although probably funnier if you can understand more than the bits that sound like russian . 
  this seems to be a [ popular ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34173252 ) option ... 
   most refugees fleeing syria are fleeing assad , above all else . 
  `` eughh why have u got to make this aboat dearest assad eughh u skrub u are bullshid '' ok . 
   do you actually believe this ? 
  you do n't think it might be isis they fear most ? 
  isis is a threat , particularly to yazidis etc. 
  as we 've seen , but there are areas in the country that are safe from isis ; the same can not be said for assad , whose air force intentionally bombs civilian areas -- the closest thing to ` safe ' areas that exist in syria right now . 
  assad accounts for more than 95 % of civilian casualties so far ; isis for about 2.5 % . 
   assad ca n't account for all the ~ ~ iraqis and ~ ~ afghanis seeking asylum . 
  iraq is a little different , as you could argue that each has fed into the other , but i should have clarified : those refs * fleeing syria * are fleeing assad above all else . 
   we are constantly hearing from eastern europeans how they are doing there part by taking in ukrainians i 've not heard this myself , though i do n't doubt it . 
  russia is taking in the ` ethnic russians ' ( etc. ), 
  which , for some time now , it has declared its intent on ` protecting ' ( even if that means killing many of them and destroying everything that they own ) . 
  like you say , they started this conflict , it 's only right that they pay the price . 
  the west ( read : the us and to a much lesser extent , europe ) was obviously complicit in the destruction of iraq , but that should n't be used ( as it is ) to tar the whole arab spring , which * began * ( and ended , in some places ) without any western interference . 
  saying the west has ever had a `` pretty big hand '' in syria is an overstatement . 
  pretty much . 
  telling europe that it alone must deal with the refugee crisis ( when most refs are fleeing assad 's barrel bombs/russian-supplied air force ) ; funding european anti-refugee parties ; vetoing tentative measures to address the refugee crisis . 
  russian leadership must be having a whale of a time -- they thrive on cynically exploiting crises and 2014 -- 2015 's already been a bumper year -- though , remarkably , it 's not making them many friends . 
  `` non-interference in domestic affairs of other states '' . 
  say what you will about what shitters their government are , they 're * reasonably * consistent on this front ( would n't support russia in georgia or in ukraine , for example ) . 
  totally agree . 
  learning a phonetic ( ish ) foreign language ( russian ) has really opened my eyes to the nightmare that must be learning to pronounce english correctly . 
  the [ exemplar ] ( http://www.thepoke.co.uk/2011/12/23/english-pronunciation/ ) as ever . 
   consistently with their pronunciation   english, 
  lol do you even know what revanchism means ?? 
  let me guide you : reclaiming ` lost ' territories or former constituents of one 's old empire , whether you call it the return of the ussr ( as some have ) or disguise it as some conservative mission , * russky mir * , a eurasian empire , or whatever -- * that 's * revanchism . 
  agreeing a trade deal with a close neighbour ? 
  not so much . 
  sorry if this upsets you . 
   i assume cee is not that much of a hot topic in uk , but i do n't think all this anti-nato sentiment would find much support in uk , right ? 
  prepare to be surprised . 
  never underestimate the degree to which the common man gives no fucks about foreign affairs . 
  those of us who * do * are going to have a serious fight on our hands ( speaking as a 2015 labour voter ) and , pessimistically , i * really * ca n't see the masses rallying against corbyn 's nonsense in the way they did over iraq , or some tangible event . 
  as a ( almost ) green voted i did n't know that . 
  wish they were still an environmental party * before * a labour contender ; you know it 's bad when you 're left with lib dems or spoilt ballot alone . 
  i prefer `` useful idiot '' ( cold war term ) or `` useful cynic '' ( modern equivalent ) since it embodies negative connotations even to those who do n't really know what these are . 
  versteher also implies that nobody else understands putin , when the opposite is likely more accurate . 
  russia 's war in donbas does n't cost * that * much , and is such a high priority that whatever damage sanctions could inflict probably would n't have any effect . 
  ( swift expulsion would have , and that 's why it was threatened , shortly before russia started winding down its donbas operation ) . 
  more custom might alleviate * some * of the low-oil-price-pain , but with europe finally getting sensible about russian energy politics -- provided it can stick together -- this matters less . 
  the above truths still hold . 
   germany has gotten out of control again . 
  no , it really has n't , not in any way you 're implying . 
   the franco-german relationship was what kept the union alive , and that balance is now dead . 
  no , it 's much as it was before . 
   with the uk leaving now your ignorance is really showing . 
  it 's a referendum ; care to look at some polling ? 
   no one will follow germany 's lead when they 're such uncompromising leader : see this case , the greek crisis , no transfer union and now the refugees crisis . 
  in the last 5 years germany has managed to destroy all trust the rest of europe had on her . 
  that 's all exaggeration . 
  * some * wo n't ; * some * have lost * some * trust . 
  might make for * ez karma * \u2122 but at least try and keep things in proportion . 
  germany ( and much of europe ) needs gas to support the economy that underpins the european union . 
  russia remains the only cost-effective source of this energy . 
  these remain true irrespective of how many people die in the donbas . 
  a europe that remains unified and resists potential inter-member shit-slinging ( looking at you , / u/rordigy ) is the * best * counter to russian energy politics -- and they know it . 
  not that i dispute the genocide charge at all , but your post makes ( or implies ) a common mistake which is to think that simply lots of deaths = = genocide , when the charge itself does n't require that many deaths at all , but simply that the killings were committed with the intent of wiping out an ethnic group , however defined . 
  therein lies the never-ending controversy . 
   what changes do you think would satisfy the no-camp ? 
  the collapse of the european union . 
   i think it is very unfair , and , well , strange and weird , to fuck us over just because dutch dislike their own government welcome to foreign-policy-by-referendum . 
  whereby some insignificant fraction of 1 % of the eu 's population can demand a veto on a policy they scarcely understand and the rest of europe takes them and their country seriously . 
   epicentre means something that 's below the centre . 
  rekt  do you actually believe that ? 
  post-soviet eu countries still are or were ruled by the communists , it was leszek miller , former party secretary who got poland in the eu . 
  yes , i clearly believe that , as did georgians and ukrainians , who rightly recognised that the only way to actually change their political circumstances lay to the west , right up until russia bombed them into backing down . 
  you are , of course , right about the communist leaders in the early expansions , where total revolution was unnecessary . 
  i was referring more to the transitions in georgia and ukraine and what should have happened in russia in the 1990s . 
  i think the media is incredibly sensitive to reporting on things that , at the time , were difficult to verify and , almost inevitably , would be construed as inciting hatred , which is exactly what happened . 
  they made a mistake , sure , but a pretty understandable and expectable one . 
  russian media has a mission ; they have * missions * , each deriving from their own interests ( their owners , their target audience , their funding/advertising , etc. ) . 
  edit : though i will just point out that not * all * russian media is utterly toxic , just the stuff that most russians actually read and believe . 
  are all reasonably independent still , even places like russia direct , which is funded by riac , still published some good stuff and some reputable names . 
   eu is not the centre of universe and it 's not a real threat to russia . 
  no , it 's just the largest market on earth , the ~ ~ epi ~ ~ centre of western democracy and liberalism , and the bloc that , secretly , all of russia 's vassals want to slip the leash and associate with ( they already keep everything they care about there : their money , their houses , their kids ) . 
  it epitomises the benefits of enduring short-term suffering by throwing out your soviet cronies , re-inventing your economy and your democracy , including : truly democratic governance , stability , and gdp growth not beholden to a single natural resource . 
  you do n't think russia worries that it 's people , like those of its neighbours , might one day want this ? 
  i think u mean the * lame * stream media , m ` gentlesir, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.levada.ru/eng/ukrainian-crisis ) one of them i 've found . 
  plurality 's pretty slim , but stands nonetheless . 
  particularly insightful russian poll data from a few months back : are russian soldiers fighting and dying in ukraine ? 
  about 3 % say `` yes '' , maybe 7 % say `` probably '' . 
  then some huge proportion , not a majority but a plurality , said `` yes , but denying this is the right policy for the government '' . 
  that 's not how isis works anyway ; it does n't have the command structure of al-qaeda so attacks come from the brainwashed indigenous , not highly co-ordinated saudi plotters ( we 've killed and disrupted all of them already ) . 
  islam is already ` under attack ' in the formers ' eyes and we 're already a prime target ; the difference made is likely non-existent . 
  nevertheless , your answer : give into their medieval ideology ; let them stone adulterous women , throw acid in the faces of the unveiled wherever they may be , execute christians * en masse * , have it * their * way ( by which i mean the islamists ' way -- there are plenty in the mena that want to live civilised lives ) . 
  then let 's just * hope * that this is enough ; that they 'll be happy with what they 've got and that they * do n't really mean * what they say about eternal global jihad and an ever-expanding caliphate . 
  then just maybe we can live our lives in peace . 
  maybe . 
  pretty contemptible imo . 
  more than anything , he actually knows what he 's talking about . 
  i get that democracy 's fab and all , and is n't it great that we had a good chinwag for all the nation to see before dropping the bombs , but really , most of them did n't have the faintest idea what they were talking about . 
  odd , they usually go for gurdwaras ... 
  did someone say maidan ? 
  * russky bots engage *, 
  those are extraordinary . 
  is he ? 
  i know the russians banged their airspace the other day , but i assumed erdogan was still muting his unrequited love in daytime while masturbating furiously over shirtless pictures of vova at night .
