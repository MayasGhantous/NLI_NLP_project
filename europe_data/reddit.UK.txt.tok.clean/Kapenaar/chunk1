i never was . 
  there 's no argument here . 
  you seem to think that it 's either open borders or death i say we should be like canada and take what we need, 
   tell me , do you believe in that little thing called human rights ? 
  tbh , not really, 
  there 's housing shortages everywhere in occident because a few landlords are speculating like hedge funds on land value instead of using it to offer habitable land at normal price . 
  that 's true . 
  but why make a bigger problem by adding to it . 
   and it might as well have not existed under tatcher . 
  was that the poles ' fault too ? 
  `` you had strained resources in the 80s so why should n't you have them now '' such a fucking race to the bottom  calling average eu citizens `` unskilled dregs of society '' is n't exactly the best way to make friends with others . 
  there are some good ones but a large amount of those who come here are the ones who could n't make it at home, 
  who said anything about autarky ? 
  canada is doing absolutely fine and they do n't have an open border for every unskilled person they take in workers they need . 
  it 's not `` open borders or death '' i would n't mind having to flash my passport to go to italy nor do i think it 's right that italians have to fund englishmen, 
  if polish computer programmers or scientists etc wanted to emigrate to the uk they could easily get a visa , but it 's the unskilled masses who come here . 
  how does britain benefit from the witcher 3, 
   statistically you do understand there are millions of british citizens that come in other eu countries too , and we got half a million brits getting welfare , retirement and healthcare worth hundreds of thousands a year in france and spain , that never contributed a buck to our tax system ? 
  say , if i apply your logic and kick them back to the uk or cur their shiny 1k/mo that fall from the sky , how would you react ? 
  because , at least people who work contribute to the system 's economic life . 
  meanwhile , your pensioners that squat my beachs by the busload certainly do n't . 
  if you want to kick them out kick them out , or make them apply for visas i welcome them home . 
  ** when ** we leave we wo n't kick out those already here but we wo n't take more . 
   raising artificial boundaries is a pipe dream , mate . 
  want a better life ? 
  be competitive , do n't just rely on the fact that your grandfather and your father were . 
  the world is only getting smaller , isolation if not the way to stay ahead of the pack . 
  you do n't need to flood the job market for no reason . 
  no other places have open borders and they 're doing fine . 
  we are literal island . 
  we should take the skilled . 
   yes , eu would be weaker without the brits , and in that sense it would be sad if they left ... you should be happy , it 's clear that we do n't want to be part of the federal state that europeans want  but while important , they are not crucial to the eu project ( and they 'll find out soon enough that they gain nothing by leaving eu - with any luck , they might even serve better eu outside as an example to the eurosceptics ) . 
  our sovereignty and control of our border . 
  no they come here for work which is finite, 
   you understand it was like always like that since wwii ? 
  `` we have housing shortages lets compound them with more housing shortages that makes sense '' the nhs did n't exist in ww2  okay . 
  what would have happen if the us said the same to the uk instead of extending the marshall plan ? 
  `` i do n't want to use our tax money to fund the lifestyle of james , william and smith when i could just use it on me . '', 
  please , tell me . 
  completely different situation , and is that supposed to be an appeal to emotion ? 
   now the irony seems quite lost on you i 'm a skilled south african , i think we should welcome skilled immigrants not unskilled dregs of society we have enough of our own . 
   seems more and more it 's headed that way , true enjoy free movement with merkel 's new germans, 
  it 's decreased from poland but increased from bulgaria and romania . 
  i just do n't see why we should shoulder that responsibility, 
  nice pictures , still does n't convince me that they should be allowed to move to england by the millions, 
   ooooh ... poor little native britons ... they have to compete . 
  life is so unfair for some people , right ? 
  :( why should they have to though ? 
   you 're right , uk must exit , and be done with all this `` compete '' nonsense . 
  i agree, 
  fictive burden ? 
  pressure on housing ( we have a shortage ) , pressure on schools , more competition for work , more pressure on the nhs . 
  it 's not `` xenophobia '' i 'm not even indigenous english it 's simply too much , and no my tax should not fund foreigners if i wanted to contribute to pawel or ivan 's lifestyle i would have moved to eastern europe not the uk . 
  it 's simple . 
  i want to live in england around english people that 's why i 'm here . 
  you can have your eu without us . 
  i do n't post there . 
  and no i have never been to eastern europe and no desire too . 
  the uk has enough poor and terrible places that 's true we do n't need more segregated ethnic enclaves . 
  okay ? 
  the uk was poor and now it 's not . 
  that does n't mean we have shoulder the burden while the east catches up . 
  go to london and see what 's happened in certain districts - it 's too much to fast . 
  we need skilled people not everyone in eastern poland who knows how to fix toilets . 
   do frenchs also build `` little paris '' and spaniards `` little madrid '' in the uk too ? 
  fulham and parts of kensington are filled with french people and certain little towns how been filled with portuguese people , and bedford is like 25 % italian . 
  do n't know about spaniards . 
  fwiw i 'm not originally from england but the thing is so many come from the east , unskilled , and swamp entire neighbourhoods . 
  it 's too much . 
  i do n't blame them there are jobs here but it 's not right for poor native britons to have to compete with them . 
  also , gypsies are a plague . 
  not being jihadists is not really a high bar . 
  yes these nations will develop in the long term but between then and now millions of people will come here and frankly if i wanted to live in a mostly polish neighbourhood i would be in cracow not england . 
  [ * i was just standin here , and tom cruise locked himself in the closet ... * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxsqpkirrv8 ), 
  i just want more reasons to leave . 
  the eu only worked with free movement when it was with other fully developed countries like france and the netherlands and germany and denmark not these post soviet poverty cases . 
  for whom ? 
  not for britain where they will flood into by the millions and turn entire neighbourhoods into `` little kharkiv '' where no english person is to be found just like the poles , bulgarians , romanians , balts , and gypsies from czechoslovakia have done . 
  yes i would think putting tom cruise in a camp is appropriate, 
  like turkey , ukraine in the eu is not worth the burden . 
  but hey one more reason to vote out, 
  i want a belgian job !, 
  we can send them to the most miserable place on earth and wall them in ... . . ** glasgow ** * shudders and gags a bit *, 
  they were given a mandate to fulfill their policies , i 'm sure their voters do n't mind . 
  also , pure democracy is n't always the best the government needs some teeth . 
  most art since that time is total kak mate, 
  he 's going to continue in vain , and be forced to come back empty handed with egg on his face - and then have to resign when we vote out . 
  or , he will have to campaign for brexit, 
  holland is a colloquialism but it 's not a nation at all . 
  people from holland are not distinct from people in utrecht or wherever . 
  england is a nation within the uk - only morons call the uk england, 
   ** welcome to the great nation of holland : ** where the tulips grow , the windmills turn , the breakfast is chocolatey , the people industrious , and the sea tries to drown it all . 
    ** except , this country is n't holland . 
  ** it 's time for :   the difference between holland , the netherlands ( and a whole lot more )   ** the correct name for this ** tulip growing , windmill building , hagelslag eating , container ship moving , ocean conquering ** nation is the netherlands . 
  ** i bolded to make it simpler for you, 
  it 's devils island still available ? 
  holland is not a country you moron, 
  yay for cheap labour for cdu 's corporate friends !, 
  fuck the german working class and their wages getting broken amirite ?!?!!, 
  the netherlands is the country holland in the netherlands is a region split up into north holland and south holland amsterdam is a city in north holland rotterdam is a city in south holland,
