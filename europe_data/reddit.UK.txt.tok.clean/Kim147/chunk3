  however it can also be looked as being a tax on output - ie . 
  revenue . 
  if the taxation point is made at the revenue stage then the implementation becomes very easy and low cost - vat is very paperwork heavy , revenue tax is not . 
  a revenue tax is very broadly based so it 's amount is much lower . 
  it 's like a profit ( corporation ) tax but operates irrespective of whether a profit is actually made and how much that profit is . 
  hence any company operating in the uk but tax domiciled in another country would still be paying uk taxes at a reasonable level . 
  the big problem is the complicated and badly designed taxation system . 
  it really needs to be rethought out thoroughly in all respects - corporate and personal . 
  it should be greatly simplified and made much easier to deal with . 
  on the large multinational company side a simple solution is to replace vat with a revenue tax for all revenue above # 1m - it would be a small amount - a few % . 
  this would greatly simplify administration and greatly reduce associated costs . 
  it would also catch any company trying to export their tax liability by techniques such as transfer pricing and management fees . 
  on a personal side the combining of all taxes - paye and nic - is a good first start . 
  however in addition all claimables can be eliminated if the taxable income is applied to all dependants - ie . 
  husband and wife together , where only one is working , would be paying less tax than they would be as individuals .

  software contains nothing novel in itself . 
  patenting software stifles innovation and new business - it prevents progression of technologies and of techniques . 
  it 's like patenting the rock & roll riff and beat - there would be no rock & roll industry and not much music industry . 
  keep a professional distance - do n't blur the line - but be nice about it . 
  they are just trying to be ` french young men ' . 
  hollande is a disaster . 
  carrefour is a place that it is very easy to be very quickly pissed off with . 
  peugeot lost the magic quite a few years ago . 
  having said all that i love france and spend a lot of time there . 
  i hope the french manage to recover the magic that makes france such a great place . 
  i have never had any major problems going into france , belgium , luxembourg , the netherlands , switzerland , germany nor ireland . 
  i have only had some very minor problems going into france from switzerland - there is an ikea smuggling problem there . 
  i do a lot of travelling - both for work and for holidays . 
  i drive , go by train and fly . 
  the only place where i have had problems is the uk and i have had problems there many times . 
  it has been mainly the channel tunnel and i would accept that there is a particular problem there . 
  i never had any problems travelling via the ferry . 
  and what job have they been paid to do ? 
  because the inane questions seem absolutely useless and anyone can give any answers . 
  the french do n't seem to have any problem letting anyone through with the right documentation - are the british creating problems where there are none ? 
  benny hill was very popular in france . 
  i 'm a brit and i travel to and from the continent a lot and i would certainly agree with the term `` police state '' . 
  i usually travel via the tunnel . 
  going over , at folkstone , the french border officer just glances at my passport and very pleasantly waves me through . 
  coming back is almost always one massive pain in the butt . 
  the british border control ask all sorts of inane questions and without any real effect - they do n't bother listening to a lot of the answers . 
  if they think that it is suspicious that i travel every month or two to the continent and back then i can only think that it 's suspicious that they visit the supermarket once , twice or three times a week - are they trying to steal from the supermarket ? 
  or even worse ? 
  apart from massively pissing off people what use are they ? 
  what good do they actually do ? 
  the petty bureaucrats , however , also exist in town councils - they can be a right pain in the butt - assuming everyone is out to steal money off them when it 's probably only them doing the stealing . 
  i find the continent a very civilised and pleasant place . 
  the french are very welcoming . 
  likewise the germans and the italians . 
  i always dread returning to britain . 
  look at how the allied powers - uk \\ western europe \\ usa \\ australia \\ nz \\ canada etc. 
  solved the great depression post wwii - how they set up their economies , what legislation they introduced etc. 
  and why and how it produced the post wwii boom that lasted right through until the mid 70 's and beyond . 
  proper free markets - * democratic capitalism - bottom up capitalism * - work by providing * a highly diverse , highly creative and highly adaptive environment * that ** quickly adjusts to new and changing market situations ** . 
  this is what makes countries rich and the opposite - top down command economies - is what makes countries poor . 
  i have put it very clearly - to put it in other words - give the customer what they want and they will buy your goods and you will become rich . 
  otherwise you will become poor . 
  this is not the conclusion , it is the mechanism - which if you read my comment is clearly stated . 
  proper free markets - democratic capitalism - bottom up capitalism - work by providing a highly diverse , highly creative and highly adaptive environment that quickly adjusts to new and changing market situations . 
  this is what makes countries rich and the opposite - top down command economies - is what makes countries poor .

  poland does not need to be a part of the euro zone in order to influence .

   early heat wave ? 
  it 's the middle of summer and high 20 's are not hot for that part of europe at this time of the year . 
  naples has a lot of problems with corruption and organised crime - hence the [ ongoing sanitation problem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naples_waste_management_issue ) . 
  i used to own a peugeot . 
  i got massively sick of being ripped off by the car yards when i got it serviced and mot 'd . 
  when i bought my current mazda i did n't consider peugeot as they looked all flash no dash - just show ponies . 
  the mazda goes very well . 
  sounds like hollande is saying [ ' i do n't know what the f $ % k i 'm doing get me out of here !, 
  ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9r7tnxs3hc ) . 
  or - let 's all have our own currencies and be responsible for ourselves - ie . 
  the ` uk ' position , and france not foot the bill for the other failing countries . 
  and will they default ? 
  a soft default ? 
  like greece has already been doing ? 
  value is what the customer pays . 
  it took the soviets over 70 's years to understand that . 
  i do n't disagree , however the debtor is still responsible for their debts . 
  and it all comes down to economic management and that has been poor since the mid 70 's and extremely poor over the last decade plus . 
  and who has taken on the debt ? 
  - surely there 's responsibility there ? 
  are the germans footing the bill ? 
  if so - ask them . 
  and i 'm talking primarily about the people . 
  because if they are then every german citizen is giving hours worked for free to the portuguese - after all money does not grow on trees . 
  suppose , for example , each portuguese person was required to spend 20 % of their hpw - ie . 
  an extra 8hpw - doing work for the country for free - this being instead of getting , say , the germans to hand over the cash . 
  the fact is the world , particularly the western world , is almighty-ly stuffed up and it needs creative thinking and courage to be sorted out . 
  at the moment all we 've got is a mass of politicians and consultants hiding up their arses and getting nowhere . 
  perhaps this is a question you should direct to the germans . 
  i did n't say that hours worked had equal value - you are making invalid assumptions . 
  if you look at any alternate currency - ` acorn currencies ' - all they are are a trade in hours worked . 
  they allow \\ facilitate this trade - this barter - to take place .
