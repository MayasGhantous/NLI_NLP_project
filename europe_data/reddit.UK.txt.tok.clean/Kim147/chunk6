  sorry if you have had a bad experience - it 's very much the exception , not the rule . 
  they need to solve the problems themselves . 
  a good way to start would be a high end property tax - basically any property valued at $ 2m or more would be taxed 1 % of it 's value per year .

  the key to getting out of the economic mess is flexibility - both business flexibility and labour market flexibility . 
  this means small government , minimal regulation and full diversity . 
  at the moment the uk has far more flexibility than the continent and , as such , is strategically positioning itself to take on a lot of the work that the other countries are missing out on \\ ca n't handle \\ do n't have the workers for etc. 
  if the economy is going very well then the social protections required for the work force - eg . 
  the social chapter - are very minimal . 
  concentrate on the economy and everything else will take care of itself .

  as such the causes will be further burried , they will not be addressed and the people who caused the mess will get away with it . 
  the french were actually very brave during wwii . 
  they had to deal with the reality of being overrun by the germans but they mounted strong behind the scenes resistance - [ les maquis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maquis_%28world_war_ii%29 ) - sabotage , intelligence etc. 
  they worked very close with the british [ soe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_operations_executive ) etc. 
  see - [ nancy wake ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nancy_wake ) . 
  it 's a matter of having a well designed economy and adjusting the levers as necessary . 
  things are very much out of balance and inflation is a lever that can help - [ see post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tgi0l/breaking_a_german_taboo_bundesbank_prepared_to/ ) from / r/europe . 
  it 's a simple calculation - take the sum of all the capital and divide it by the sum of the population and the resulting figure per person is not all that large . 
  savings are poor investments in low interest rate economies . 
  it 's far better to invest in new business investments . 
  there are also a lot of investment moneys safe harboured . 
  moderate inflation - about double what we curently have - encourages the movement of this money into new business investments thus stimulating the economy whilst , at the same time , making the debt easier to pay off . 
  and where do they propose the money comes from ? 
  - the magic fairy ? 
  out of the frying pan and into the fire . 
  i 'm watching m6 . 
  the socialist commentator has basically talked about an all out war taking down the establishment on all sides including the church - egalitie being the key word . 
  the europe of peter mandelson is the factory gate europe . 
  it is the staid and decaying europe . 
  it is not the entrepreneurial moving ahead europe , the europe that is adjusting to new realities . 
  sorry - it says nothing - just a bit of waffle . 
  a top down europe does n't work . 
  it ends up brussels trying to adjust the externals - the people , the individual countries - to their vision , their ideology - ` you will do it this way and it will work because i say it will work ' . 
  bottom up - a europe adjusted to what the people - the europeans - want will work . 
  in ` designing ' europe it has to take full account of both the desires of the people and the reality itself . 
  to ignore either is to court disaster . 
  i think one must look at how disastrous a socialist administration would be for france and europe - whether it is led by dominique strauss-kahn or francois hollande . 
  it would be out of the frying pan and into the fire . 
  if the government takes on debt it has to source that debt from investors and it then has to pay back the investors with interest - so it costs the tax payers . 
  however if the government does n't take on debt the investors still have their investment moneys but they have to look elsewhere to place them . 
  if the government creates good conditions for new business investment this will attract the placement of investment moneys , will stimulate the economy but wo n't cost the taxpayers anything . 
  business people are far better capable of successfully applying investment moneys than government . 
  government is likely to be very ineffective - ie . 
  unproductive - in it 's application of any investment moneys . 
  i would warn - to assume `` left = = good '' and `` right = = bad '' is a very wrong assumption to make . 
  there is good and evil on both the left and the right . 
  the big danger is not to see the evil that is in the left - because of an assumption of it not being there . 
  and to assume that there is not good in the right is a further big mistake . 
   i suspect that the realities of the eurozone have reached a point where only two options exist :  1 ) the folding together of the eurozone states , with a debt pool , shared budgets , joint taxation , and fiscal union . 
   in other words , the nation states must abolish themselves ( leaving only the shell ) , and germany must cease to exist in any meaningful form . 
  this was always the inherent logic of emu . 
  we are coming close to the moment when it must be decided . 
   2 ) the system blows apart . 
  from a german point of view , target2 means if the deed were done `` twere better it were done quickly '' . 
  perhaps very quickly . 
   all else is quatsch and wishful thinking . 
  whatever the cloak of foggy rhetoric , mr weidmann seems to understand that elemental point perfectly . 
  should we cheer him on , or should we tremble ? 
  it is not uncommon for member states to tell brussels to go jump . 
  france is a classic on this - look at french history over free trade between states with regards to gambling for example - france requires any company providing gambling on the internet to get french approval before trading in france ( this includes the euromillions lottery ) . 
  it 's been taken to court by brussels several times and lost each time but does not budge . 
  of all the states the uk is probably the most law abiding . 
  personally i think hollande is a nasty little shit and he will try to govern with smoke and mirrors and produce a lot of damage at the same time . 
  the other candidates , except sarkozy , are n't in the ball park . 
  i would go for sarkozy as : - i ) he is moderate to right - he will maintain a balance and he will do what is necessary to advance france forward . 
  ii ) he is not confused with ideology - he will be pragmatic and he will not subvert france to ideology . 
  iii ) he has good experience . 
  this is very important . 
  europe is not the usa . 
  a one size fits all approach does not work with europe - this approach is one of the reasons why the eu has so many problems at the moment . 
  the eu needs to revert to the eec in form . 
  most of the fonctionaires and much of the funding needs to be repatriated \\ got rid of . 
  europe 's strength is in it 's diversity - it needs to maintain and maximise this . 
  i see myself and british and as european both in terms of identity , i also see myself as australian and as international . 
  i do n't see europe as a single nation - i think that that is the wrong approach to the whole eu question . 
  i do see it as a collection of somewhat like minded nation states . 
  not here - the local council have doggy ` loos ' - sandpits . 
  the singer - [ arnold george dorsey ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0401887/ ) . 
  the real - [ engelbert humperdinck ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0401886/ ) . 
  no problem . 
  get all your members together , ` tax ' them as individual people and then spread the anti-austerity around . 
  eurovision is a complete piss take anyway so best to go all the way for once and put in a serious act . 
  the op has touched below on cross boarder issues of taxation and the application of that taxation re . 
  health etc. 
  if i can give a couple of examples of ` inventiveness ' : - there are a lot of workers who spend large amounts of time outside of their own home countries . 
  contractors are a classic example . 
  if they work more than 183 days in most continental countries they have to be no longer working via their own ltd. co. 's - ie as a small business person - but by a local umbrella company . 
  their costs - specifically their taxes and charges more than double - and likewise their rate is greater . 
  in our current economic conditions they get screwed from all sides . 
  so much so that many uk contractors will not work continental contracts . 
  and because of this great labour market inflexibility the economies of many of the euro zone countries are suffering . 
  this is a classic example of a top down solution that has not been well thought out . 
  when a contractor finishes a contract he \\ she goes back to their home country - it 's from there that they derive their benefits - not some other country where they have only been working a short to medium time . 
  it would have been far better for people to nominate their own home countries to whom they pay their taxes , from who they derive their benefits , including retirement benefits . 
  another area is currencies . 
  we operate on a fiat currency basis . 
  the euro is a currency union but not a full financial union . 
  the individual countries need to have full control over their economies - hence full responsibility over their economies . 
  this means having their own individual currencies and having these floated and freely traded .
