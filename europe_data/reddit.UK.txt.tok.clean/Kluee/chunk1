the uk has ** by far ** been one of the most anti-russian countries in the past few years . 
  the fact that people even thought this possible is somewhat upsetting . 
   i agree with boris johnson here . 
  that 's certainly not a sentence you hear very often . 
   they would be kicked out of nato for attacking an ally surely it would be a war of self defence , as the uk is unlikely to ever attack spain unless they militarily and illegally take gibraltar . 
  why does everyone seem to think of the uk as the aggressors in this case ? 
  we have no reason to ever go to war with spain , and we 've never said otherwise . 
  half is a bit of an exaggeration . 
  a quarter , at most . 
  ... what ? 
   50 % of the islands in this supposed `` geographical region '' actively dispute that term . 
  again , there 's more than just 2 islands in the british isles . 
  unless you 're accounting for the thousands of other islands in your comment ? 
   people have fought and died for this shit . 
  i very much doubt it was solely the naming of the isles that caused those people to fight . 
  that 's mostly because people did n't understand the other option nor did they care to learn it . 
  it does n't need a new name . 
  the area is referred to near globally as the british isles . 
  there is no need to change its name because some nationalists get offended by the word `` british '' . 
  i was merely saying the two names are not interchangeable . 
  my point was never to include every island in the geographical name . 
   i prefer the dutch system for democracy than the british one with their crappy `` first past the post '' system that generates a binary bullshit government . 
  i think that 's pretty universally agreed upon . 
  the first pass the post system is bullshit and most people already know this . 
   it simply takes less tongue-gymnastics to say `` british isles '' than `` great britain and ireland '' . 
  the british isles consists of more than just great britain and ireland . 
  the isle of man , for example , is neither part of great britain nor ireland , yet it 's still part of the british isles . 
  ah yes , the snps could never do any wrong . 
  it 's not like they are threatening to leave a union in which over 60 % of their exports are to . 
  the eu and uk make up nearly 80 % of scottish exports . 
  if scotland leaves both , what on earth could investors ever see in scotland ? 
   how do you explain that ? 
  it 's simple , it 's westminsters fault / s, 
  well , they have been constantly threatening to leave the uk , not many people are gon na invest in a country that will leave both the uk and the eu , 1 is already a major hit on your economy . 
  in what way are they mutually exclusive ? 
  why does the uk have to fail for the eu to succeed ? 
  that 's not a very good mentality to have . 
  what a stupid thing to say , a war is the last thing anybody should be asking for right now . 
  fun 's certainly not the word i 'd use . 
  it was tough , but we got there in the end . 
  we got botted to shit by r/globaloffensive to the east , though . 
  take us back , take us back !, 
  this is literally like the first week of negotiations , of course it 's gon na start with ridiculous demands . 
  give it time , i say . 
  i hope you 're joking ... 
   as an example , romania got canadian visa exemption or else about ceta . 
  one for all and all for one . 
  those are two completely different circumstances and you know it . 
  london 's a big place . 
   you could also present it like this ; `` the people they are governing '' includes anyone they have power over , mening anyone within their borders . 
  the government governs its citizens . 
  i 'm not an american citizen if i simply walk over their borders . 
  governments are supposed the look after the people they 're governing , not fuck them over in some heroic attempt to solve crime in other regions of the world . 
  i think it 's helped us , though , the iras constant attacks forced us to update and improve our counter-terrorism measures , and until very recently we really had n't seen a terrorist attack on our soil because of it . 
  everyone 's playing checkers , but erdogan 's been playing chess for years . 
  wales better get running . 
  lancashire . 
  i guess us northerners do n't get it too bad after all , eh ? 
  uk media has always been dreadful , what are you talking about ? 
  hey , this sub is still better than r/unitedkingdom , that is truly a pathetic sub . 
  that 'd be greedy . 
  i have the slightest sense you are n't a great fan of the u.k. 
  both sides were calling for a second referendum at some point . 
  you must be fun at parties . 
  i do n't pay much attention to turkish politics , but is erdogan popular among voters ? 
  everything i 've heard him do seems pretty terrible . 
  uk stronk my friend, 
  the internet is non-essential for human * extistence * , so get off of it . 
   marriage is the legal basis for starting a family . 
  if you 're not going to produce children you do n't get married . 
  you 've just achieved the ** dumbest thing i 've heard today ** award !, 
  it 's not just any food , its ** bagels ** . 
  i 'm not sure you understand what a meme is . 
  this ship just screams ** rule britannia ** . 
  its brilliant . 
  you can , i can see multiple discussions in this thread alone that have n't mentioned brexit . 
  you 're kidding ? 
  60 billion is a huge amount , the uk spends 80 billion on education , and 55 billion on military . 
  asking for over a years worth of military expenses just to start the negotiations is rediculous . 
  why the fuck did you have to make it political . 
  it 's a pretty street , just leave it at that . 
  it 's a national pass time . 
  considering northern ireland is n't even classed as part of the uk on this map , it seems pretty unprofessional . 
  also , thats poland , not ukraine . 
  why is northern ireland separate to the rest of the uk ? 
  oh dear , it appears we 're stuck with him . 
  not really a surprise , the guys a damn fool . 
  not a surprise , our national sub is a depressing shithole . 
  at least you are n't london . 
   the people not allowed or unable to vote , outnumber those who voted to leave . 
  you do realize that is completely irrelevant , right ? 
  that 's not how ** any of this ** works . 
  i very much doubt its england , either . 
  y' know , seeing as 60 % of all english people would have to be following 1 direction on twitter for that to be the case . 
  this is one of the most retarded things i 've ever read on reddit . 
  england and the uk are not the same thing . 
  forgetting ireland ? 
  europeans have had enough of experts !, 
  chavs are like their own breed of people at this point . 
   is n't it the 6th ** now ** if you can find some trustworthy sources for 2017 that place france infront of the uk , be my guest .
