  we 're doing the sane thing of funding the refugees that are * staying * in their country , rather than telling them to take a thousand mile journey and trespass through tens of countries to reach us . 
  the tories do n't understand how the internet works . 
  they 're all oldies who have no idea what they 're doing when it comes to technology . 
   enough people did believe it for brexit to actually happen yes , because # 350 million going to the nhs was the only reason brexit happened . 
  lmao , were you in a coma or just not paying any fucking attention ? 
   ya cos it keeps being a valid point time and time again it 's not a valid point , it was already proven false before the fucking vote . 
  barely anybody believed # 350 million would go to the nhs every week . 
  it 's a shit joke you can post on pro eu subs for a quick bit of karma , nothing more . 
  lmao , i fucking voted remain . 
  what in the fuck have i actually done ? 
  the guy said a shit joke that has been posted on literally every thread about the uk for over a year now . 
  quit crying you fuckin ' doof . 
   i 'll hang around for the wingy pommy bashing . 
  the fuck do you have against british birds ? 
  this subreddit is such a fun place to be sometimes . 
  copy + paste, 
  yeesh , no fun allowed , eh ? 
  they all do , hence the political shithole we 're in at the moment . 
  give us a few years , we 'll be back on our feet in no time . 
   can anybody explain the stance of labour on the single market and free movement of people ? 
  fuckin ' god knows , mate . 
  well , things * are * looking up for labour , their numbers are steadily climbing . 
  the lead would be significantly smaller if ukip did n't just collapse in on itself and give the tories a big boost . 
  seems reasonable , no doubt if they did hold inderef2 while brexit was still being processed and voted remain , the snp would be demanding inderef3 once the effects of brexit have kicked in . 
  i never said it was . 
  i said europe loves * hearing * about him . 
  it 's a fucking goldmine for our journalists . 
  he 's literally irrelevant , he simply has nothing better to do . 
  europe loves hearing about his idiocy so the media keeps reporting on him . 
  stop giving his elderly rambles attention and he 'll sod off . 
  leading the way , as per usual / s, 
  head on back to r/unitedkingdom , lad . 
  you do n't belong here . 
  you can delete comments , ** captain turd sandwich ** . 
   it does n't like having to actually pay people though . 
  fucking lol , the uk has some of the highest wages in europe , * wage growth * being down has nothing to do with actual wages , hence why so many people emigrate here for the higher wages . 
  that 's simply because you have n't been looking , the current front page of r/europe : 1st post .

  ah yes , * spanish people * must 've been the reason london was a remain area !, 
  this is literally the most retarded reasoning i 've read to date . 
  leave the queen out of this . 
   we beat the english [ impossible ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854xqcfcy ), 
  that was n't my point . 
  he said :  honestly after scotland and n.ireland jump the ship england will be left all alone . 
  i was pointing out that he forgot wales existed . 
  he also appears to have forgotten that wales exists . 
  i honestly would n't take any sort of prediction about the uk that seriously at the moment , and yes , ** that includes the positive ones ** . 
  the country is simply too volatile for these things to be relevant . 
  roosevelt had been pushing to get in the war for ages . 
  they were buying military bases in the uk for christ sakes . 
  public support for joining the war was over 70 % before pearl harbor and they had been beefing up their military since the outbreak of the war in preparation for their intervention . 
  pearl harbour merely gave them a reason to join the war in the eyes of their isolationist policies at the time . 
  probably because they were practically enemies with us even during the war . 
  they started ww2 along with germany by attacking poland , and would have likely stayed out of the war if the germans did n't attack them . 
  people give the us shit all the time for joining the war late , but at least they joined on their own accord . 
  it 's pointless to have these `` who did the most '' discussions . 
  if you take out any of the big three , the war would have likely been lost . 
  they specialised in different fields of warfare , and quite frankly , trying to compare them is a bit stupid . 
  do n't worry lad , you 're german , it 's only natural . 
  how dare you ? 
  that river is a national treasure !, 
  shame on you !, 
  farage is constantly up trump 's backside , yet nearly every brexiter i know despises trump . 
  farage was n't even in the official leave campaign . 
  it 's nothing like that . 
   people got duped we 're never going to get anywhere with that mentality . 
  the russian empire in 1916 was huge though , a lot bigger than present day russia . 
  which country is riddled with corruption , censors the internet and imprisons its journalists ? 
  which country is fucking communist ? 
  how am i even having this conversation right now ? 
  so many questions . 
  wait a second ... did you just say the us ' government is more alien to us than fucking * china * ? 
   the uk wants only the free trade part of the single market , while ignoring the freedom of movement part . 
  many countries have free trade agreements with the eu , or are in the process of getting one . 
  she 's absolutely retarded . 
  seriously , i can stand corbyn , he 's a bit dumb , but he 's got a good heart . 
  abbott though , fucking braindead , she is . 
  here 's just a few of her genius interviews over the passed week : [ 1 . 
  on recruiting more police officers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnebbkrve7a ) [ 2 . 
  on self defence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvajc8_mqem ), 
   what someone wants , expects and positions for are all separate things . 
  that was literally my entire point . 
  you 're the one acting like what we want is even remotely relevant . 
  free trade and the single market are not the same thing . 
  well , no shit it 's what we want . 
  why on earth would n't we want that ? 
  what a dumb point to make . 
   we wo n't know the actual uk position until the eu leak it to us during the actual negotiations . 
  [ theresa may stated what she expected in her letter to the eu , keep up lad .

  it 's gon na be painful , maybe we should have a quick war to pass the time , for old times sake , eh ? 
  i 'd hope so , seeing as it was a damn joke .
