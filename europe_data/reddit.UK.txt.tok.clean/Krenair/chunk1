yes , pretty much : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_great_britain_and_ireland `` the united kingdom of great britain and ireland was the formal name of the united kingdom between 1801 and 1927 , reflecting the fact that until 1922 , all of ireland was a part of the state . '', 
  it was a merger of the kingdom of great britain ( england - including wales - and scotland , which had merged from two separate kingdoms themselves in 1707 ) with the kingdom of ireland , hence `` united '' kingdom . 
  just slightly . 
  if they 're sorted alphabetically , i 'm guessing there 's a dropdown and he forgot to change it . 
  or , y' know , using a redirect . 
   drownings yes , these do generally cause people to drown, 
  this one : http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/uxndo/gay_marriage_is_one_of_worst_threats_in_500_years/c4zi8ki, 
  does n't / ca n't really apply to a democratic sovereign nation changing things by direct vote of the population . 
  the other way around . 
  we automatically qualify because we are one of the top 5 financial contributors to the ebu . 
  i do n't think princess madeleine is a head of state or a diplomat though . 
  also / u/frivilligt ( further up in the thread ) said the baby will get swedish citizenship * later * - if the baby does n't have citizenship in either country from birth , wo n't it be stateless for a while ? 
  i think they have some kind of german accents , as his friend at 1:19 says `` aaah schei\u00dfe '', 
  it 's presumably to stop ambiguity between the island ( part of the british isles ) and the independent country . 
   - british cars are not that awesome . 
   scotland has a great deal of self-governance , including its own parliament . 
  wales and northern ireland also have their own parliaments ( national assemblies ) . 
  only england does not have one . 
   it turns out you can lose your driving license for rowing under influence what 's the story behind this ? 
   there has been some weather . 
  i think you missed a word here . 
   or perhaps even do some other combination , like this grouping of the scottish , english , and french ones : http://i.imgur.com/van8pli.jpg not sure northern ireland would like that , 
  i do n't really care about what the un thinks of self-determination . 
  you suggested that the ideas of `` territorial integrity '' and `` decolonisation '' are as important as self-determination . 
  i 'm not sure what other reaction you expected from people in basically democratic countries . 
   equally valid legal basis , spain under territorial integrity and decolonisation , britain under self-determination i. . . what ? 
  how are these ** equally ** valid ? 
  and also probably `` had a sexually transmitted disease '' one as well . 
  10-100 % lol, 
   the people who want out of the eu are doing it for economic changes , they are doing it for social ones i think you accidentally a word . 
  color ? 
   we are all so beautiful -- / u/shiningtesticles, 
  for all sides ? 
  who do you think it 's good for and who do you think it 's bad for ? 
  sigh . 
  am turning 18 in mid november of that year so i guess i 'll miss it . 
  how old do you need to be to vote in ep elections ? 
   like he did before can you expand on that please ? 
  i must 've missed something ... 
  derekjdurant said the bishops ( the sentence was specific to the bishops ) all voted against the gay marriage bill , and in response you linked to a page showing that the majority of lords ( a much larger group ) supported the gay marriage bill . 
    they all voted against gay marriage   what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  [ 1 ] you deliberately misinterpreted that . 
  all of the ** bishops ** ( who voted at all ) voted to deny it a second reading in the lords : http://www.parliament.uk/templates/lordsdivisions/pages/lordsdivisions.aspx?id=51023&amp;epslanguage=en&amp;date=2013-jun-04&amp;itemid=1&amp;session=2013-may-08, 
  did n't include northern ireland either ... 
  `` sideshow bob '' on ukraine 's voter . 
   that argument does n't sound right to me . 
  i actually ca n't believe that someone could buy such a weak argument . 
  if a company operates in germany , the company must follow german laws . 
  it 's as self-evident that i do n't understand how someone could question it !, 
  maybe they do n't have any offices in germany . . ? 
  edit : oh , they do : http://www.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20100220-25389.html#.ur6i515lx84, 
   the us is n't about to start flagrantly ignoring wto rules [ umm ] ( https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130129/11040821818/us-still-warning-antigua-that-it-better-not-set-up-piracy-hub-even-as-wto-gives-approval.shtml ) ... 
   though this is / r/europe and it 's the uk that 's in the eu , not just england . 
  this is / r/europe not / r/eu, 
  sort of . 
  some idiots associate it with bnp/edl members , but i 'm basically the opposite to them . 
  i just picked it because it 's more specific than the uk one . 
  edit : i 'm not a conservative if that 's what you were thinking . 
  the tories are divided on it . 
  i 'm not sure about the others . 
  the more i think about this year , the more i realise that making such definitive predictions is ridiculous . 
  i agree you have to draw the line somewhere , but is 2 years really enough ? 
  yeah . 
  though i think drawing the line at 2 years specifically may have been a mistake . 
  i think it 's difficult to blame lord kerr for brexit . 
  well , he has pretty much made ( or is in the process of making ) his position irrelevant i guess  edit : i think there has to be some votes on the eu side of any exit deal however - i 'm not sure how that will play out . 
   in his defence : he is not really elected in britain he 's an mep for south east england . 
  i think what we 're talking about here is that same-sex marriages are now * legally recognised * . 
  you think we 're inherently in a worse position than germany ... because we have devolution ? 
  does n't work . 
  edit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yrowsb9ku0 seems to work in the uk edit # 2 : argh , now it does n't anymore, 
  list of things : * tory + labour coalition in the uk list of things that will happen in a million years : ... 
  the point you bring up about the problems with a con-dup coalition is interesting . 
  do the tories have a majority of english or english + welsh mps ? 
  i do n't think labour can put together a coalition to form a majority now , as the lib dems wo n't participate in another coalition after the last one left the party in ruin , and i heard the snp wo n't either . 
  and dup are expected to form a coalition with the tories . 
  which leaves what , the greens , plaid , and some independents ? 
  i do n't think it 's enough . 
  on the other hand , although these parties wo n't form a coalition , sone of them might back a motion of confidence in a labour government to attempt to oust the tories ? 
  informal *, 
   it was called about 7 weeks ago by the prime minister theresa may from the conservative party ( tories ) . 
  technically the house of commons called it , because of the fixed term parliaments act . 
  12 to portugal though . 
  lena , who won it in 2010 ? 
   with the prime minister , ** can force through laws ** unless parliament votes no confidence no one else seems to be bringing this up but it sounds significant . 
  the president and prime minister together can have the same effect as an act of parliament ? 
  fuzheado already did that , before money_on_the_table commented . 
  yeah , i do n't think wikipedia is going to disable logged out editing . 
  people make accounts to vandalise all the time , that would n't solve any vandalism . 
  wikipedia does actively block people/ips who vandalise . 
  sometimes it takes a few warnings on the talk page of the bad user before someone reports to the administrator intervention against vandalism page , and an admin steps in to issue a block . 
  what more do you think could be done ? 
  i was not given an option to do programming at gcse . 
  it may be because of my school though . 
  we 've been looking into sixth forms and it looks like the sixth form attached to the school does not offer computer science ( but instead a more advanced version of the gcse course , still basically doing office stuff ) - another nearby one does computer science . 
  only recently did my secondary school install chrome . 
  it 's not even on all of the machines though . 
   it education in britain used to be how to use microsoft office i 'm taking an ict gcse at the moment . 
  it still is . 
  it 's not possible ( thankfully ) .
