  lovely city , cheaper than expected but far too many roads for my liking and i could never get used to the idea of pies being primarily a desert . 
  the number of south africans currently living in the uk and claiming to have fled from anti-white witch hunts tends to give that impression . 
  the number of horrifying articles that come up when you search for `` south africa anti-white '' does n't boost my confidence either . 
  it 's one example of * many * . 
  this is a story only from earlier this week for goodness sake . 
  how about the story from today about a mexican food place that was shut down by protestors in portland , because the owners were white ? 
  or the shooting in fresno last month where three people were shot dead at random just because they were white ? 
  this shit is happening at an alarming rate , and the sooner you wake up to it the sooner you can avoid becoming the next south africa or zimbabwe . 
  so in your eyes , something like this recent story about a hawaii professor [ demanding her white peers all resign because of their skin colour ] ( https://www.campusreform.org/?id=9197 ) is n't racist ? 
  come on lad . 
   medical science of which there is none . 
  or is this the same kind of pseudo science that bill nye had been peddling recently ? 
  though the misuse of the term ` liberal ' is irritating , that 's no strawman . 
  racism against white people is a worrisome trend that 's gained a lot of traction in the us . 
  if you build the retirement homes , they will come . 
  well , they did try to leave , which ended up with the american civil war . 
  shortly afterwards , the inion made leaving the united states illegal . 
  is that we we have neither a united eu or a strong un ? 
  like europe , it really depends on which state you go to . 
  there 's a reason why the ` rebel flag ' is so popular in the south . 
  it 's certainly outside the realm of possibility . 
  farage can do far more damage in brussels by trolling juncker into making more cockups . 
  surely a shotgun would be more patriotic ? 
  as someone who is currently the biggest controversial political figure in britain , i 'd be worried if gchq did n't have him on some sort of list . 
  if they really did agree on the issue , them why is the number of redistributed migrants so low ? 
  does n't look like agreement to me . 
   because internationally nations agreed that if someone flees from a war torn country you offer refuge . 
  that 's why border countries ca n't blankly send them away . 
  once they 're ** in ** the eu they 're a european problem that ca n't be brushed off to border states . 
  brilliant , except the eu does not share borders with syria or iraq . 
  by your own definition , this is not a european responsibility . 
  it 's the responsibility of israel , saudi arabia , and turkey . 
  the moment they leave those refuges for better standards of living , they cease to be refugees and become economic migrants . 
   what we need in order :  pretty much unconditional unity that eu borders are a ** common ** problem for every single member state . 
  agreed . 
  now if only we could stop certain dominant eu members from ignoring that and sending out mass invitations for migrants ...  border states willing to at least jointly work on the security of outer eu borders with some type of supranational body . 
  yes , this includes giving up some national sovereignty . 
  why does there need to be a supernational body ? 
  why is giving up more sovereignty a necessity to secure the borders ? 
  what is wrong with simply coordinating a multinational eu effort to give help to those members who need it ? 
  cooperation is the answer here , not orwellian ` supernationalism ' . 
   re-evaluation of how refugees are handled in general . 
  the solution to , as a random example , a civil war in the us ca n't be expecting mexico and canada to shelter 300 million people . 
  why is that an unreasonable expectation ? 
  these are n't people who are fleeing war , they 're people fleeing turkey because they 're unsatisfied with the refuge given . 
  they are economic migrants by definition , not refugees . 
   trump is impeached for not being trump unfortunately , trump is very much definitely trump . 
   european ~ ~ solidarity ~ ~ tyranny ftfy, 
  eh , the polish are alright in my book . 
  the ones living in the uk are just as much victims as we are , after the eu promised them loads of low wage jobs that we just did n't have . 
  i fail to see how that is europe 's problem . 
  why should we pick up the bill when wealthy neighbouring muslim states to syria do nothing to help ? 
  and i learned that scotland has a new parliament building , which looks utter shit compared to the lovely old gothic one . 
  bloody scots , always finding more ways to disappoint us !, 
  congratulations , [ you 've inspired me to make this . 
  [ here 's a shot from a different angle . 
  ] ( http://the-void.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/maul__sidious.jpg ), 
  that just goes to show how insufferable and useless they are . 
  they think you are supposed to cook pizza in a deep fat fryer , for god 's sake . 
  the bbc used to get away with it by having a monopoly on the news as well , those days did n't last forever . 
  we 're starting to see it in the us too , with anything outside the traditional mainstream media being smeared as ` fake news ' . 
   i always wonder how much of these exploitation rings are left invisible within countries where you would not expect it . 
  hollywood is one of the big ones that everyone knows exists but feel powerless to do anything about it . 
  it 'll be interesting to see what names appear in the headlines when that ball finally drops . 
  i for one , am in full support for scotland declaring independence and attempting to join the eu . 
  it 's only then that the rest of the world will find out why we have such little patience for the entitled buggers . 
   but the eu did at least prioritise spending that money in provincial areas , whereas previous governments have left anywhere outside of london to rot . 
  if that were true , those areas would n't have voted to leave . 
  even if the eu did prioritise funding in those areas , it mostly went on projects to make the area more attractive for wealthy investors , and not to directly benefit the people that live there . 
  macron is doing what france does best , surrendering to germany . 
   what is dead is your little hope that france be taken over by neo nazi 's . 
  no , instead it 's being taken over by [ actual nazis . 
   you 're just a sad internet troll who will hopefully be back in his little xenophobic hole in 6 years ' time . 
   you have n't been paying much attention to the polls in the uk then ? 
  comrade corbyn has killed the left over here , we 're not going away for a very long time , 
   not sure why you care . 
  because it means we 'll be back again in 6 years with the u.s and russia to clear up your mess , [ just like last time . 
  ] ( http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/57/91757-004-a6a7afd6.jpg ), 
  he gave me an out to cuck and bow down to our glorious masters in brussels . 
  sorry to disappoint you , but we voted to leave !, 
  you 'll take our smug superiority as we watch the downfall of europe from a safe distance ( again ) , and you 'll enjoy it . 
  but do n't worry , like last time we 'll be back in 6 years with the u.s and russia to clear up the mess and give you another shot . 
  so you / r/politics and / r/marchagainsttrump brigaders keep saying . 
  brigaders go home pls . 
  you think dropping bombs makes a difference ? 
  intelligence shows that it 's ` degenerate ' western culture and the spread of saudi funded mosques that is responsible for the most in isis recruitment , miley cyrus 's twerking has created more terrorists than bombs ever have . 
  how do you explain homegrown terrorism ? 
  or their medieval practices ? 
  how does dropping a bomb make someone want to throw acid at women and throw gay people from buildings ? 
  military action has nothing to do with it , medieval culture and a fundamentally violent religion is what causes these people to commit atrocities . 
  enough with the self-flagellation already . 
  there 's nothing we can do to reverse the stupidity of our weak predecessors except keep a close eye on potential radicals and throw them in a hole if they buy too much fertiliser . 
  this is thankfully something the uk excels at , though i wish i could say the same on the other side of the channel . 
  other than that , the uk is already doing what needs to be done . 
  leave the corrupt european union that treats it 's members as resources to be exploited rather than sovereign nations , and put a halt on this sort of mass immigration from ever happening again . 
  turn a blind eye to the islamisation of france , and be a good lapdog to his eu masters ? 
   local citizens haha , is that what you continentals are calling them now ? 
  be real here , all these attackers have been from middle eastern origin , calling them ` local ' is only to make it sound like they 're natives when they are clearly not . 
  i 'm just going to assume it 's not enough drugs until / r/politics stops brigading this sub . 
  not enough drugs ?
