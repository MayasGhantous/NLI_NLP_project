   his name is nigel fuck , should have known that . 
  and the problem with people like farage is that they 're like a trojan horse . 
  you vote them in for their good policies , and watch as they unleash all these other ones too . 
  farage is anti-nhs , anti-gay rights , and pro-animal cruelty . 
  he 's right on europe , but dangerously wrong on everything else . 
  corbyn is exactly the same too , just on the other side of the political spectrum . 
  correct on some things , but a threat to national security elsewhere . 
  i keep saying this , but of all the people in europe the one who predicted this would happen was ~ ~ nicolas ~ ~ nigel farage . 
  fucking farage , some half drunk racist that has no idea who most of his party members even are , saw this coming all the way back in april . 
  it 's a damning state of affairs , and it 's going to feed far-right attitudes . 
  it 's routinely accused of being a government mouthpiece . 
  it 's bias usually goes with whichever party is in government . 
  the bbc during the blair years was unbearable . 
  securing their border from the illegal migrants . 
  you should take a leaf out of their book . 
  sovereignty that was totally handed over freely and willingly . 
  there was n't any bullying of smaller states whatsoever to join the union . 
  nope , none at all . 
  and now what we 're seeing with the migrant crisis is smaller countries are finally standing up to the big bullies of europe . 
  as said elsewhere , the whispers of ` we told you so ' are sweeping across the channel . 
  the ww2 reference was also half meant as a joke . 
  do n't get your drindls 's in a twist jerry . 
  it seems the german government have somehow forgotten they lost the second world war , and have been acting like they won the conquest of europe . 
  and upset our fragile freddo based economy even more ? 
  why would you want such a thing ? 
  i 'm sure that 's * real * easy for you to say from the comfort and security of the us . 
  it 's one thing to watch something happen on the other side of the planet , and another to have it happen on your doorstep . 
  how would you like the us to respond if canada declared free citizenship for any mexican immigrants that could successfully smuggle themselves over the us , only to change their minds when they they were halfway across the country ? 
  and better yet , if canada were then to threaten to cut of trade with the us unless they accepted them all ? 
  1917 , 1944 , and do n't forget 1966 !, 
  but we * do * have hobnobs . 
  ** naturally ** change , yes . 
  but what 's happening now in europe wholly unnatural , being forced on by austria and germany who seem to have forgotten they lost ww2 again . 
   except the uk , generalising brits is always fine chi beth m8 ? 
  i wonder how long it 'll take for your government to figure out that the vast majority are n't refugees . 
  i would n't call mama merkel centre-right . 
  migrants will move onto croatia , who will be pressured into closing their borders as well . 
  then serbia . 
  and it 'll keep going back until migrants are unable to enter europe at all . 
  merkel does not get to dictate all of europe . 
  ahem . 
  iirc , the man starting beating his wife and threw her on the tracks . 
  the police then tried to pull him off her , and he resisted while making it look like the police were the ones beating his wife . 
   then explain me why they stayed in power and gone to war . 
  if majority of people would be opposed to that they would be ousted from position of power . 
  he was . 
  tony blair was ousted from power in 2007 , and replaced with gordon brown . 
  he then promptly fled the uk . 
   aside from that like i said parliamentary democracy means that gov represents its people and whatever gov does is what people agree on regardless if few of them does n't want that . 
  again , that 's not how it works at all . 
  especially with a multi-party and multi-state system like the uk . 
  you ca n't take a protest of one million people in a single city , and spin it as only one million people opposing the war . 
  it simply does n't work like that . 
  and the thing is , nobody really expected labour to be pro-war . 
  it 's not what the party stands for . 
  it 's like if greece were to vote in golden dawn , only for them to change their mind and say the love the eu . 
  nobody expected the left-wing labour party to veer off to the right and get so deeply in bed with bush post 9/11, 
   did n't these people come here fleeing these conflicts to begin with ? 
  that 's what happens when you hand over immigration control to organised gangs instead of the proper authorities . 
   when shit hit fan there were ** only 1mln people ** on streets out of all people . 
  not even your cake day can save you from how dumb this is . 
  1 million is a huge number for a protest in a single city . 
  literally the most unpopular newspaper in britain . 
  for good reason too . 
  it 's not britain 's fault that france has decided to let migrants build a shanty town in calais instead of processing them . 
  yes , because blair had the complete backing of the country at the time , thus ` deserving it ' . 
  there was n't a massive protest of one million people in london against the war , and he certainly did n't have his term ended early amid calls to put him on trial for war crimes after it ended . 
  and after that , he definitely never fled the country altogether , never to be seen again . 
  good on him . 
  he 's come up with solutions to these issues that have both kept the euroskeptics happy , and have gone above and beyond the idiotic short sighted plans of merkel . 
  as much as i hate him , he deserves every good scrap of press he gets . 
  if there was some way to combine cameron and corbyn , keeping the foreign policy of the former and the national policies of the latter , we 'd have the perfect leader . 
  from itv as well . 
  hardly the fucking guardian . 
  you guys must be a hoot at parties . 
  but nazism is a german thing . 
  that 's the joke . 
  or worse , leave the eu and join putin 's * other * eu . 
  germany has a pretty poor history with nazism ? 
   especially when the countries you refer to are the ones who only stay afloat with the help of those funds . 
  greece perhaps , but the uk ? 
  hold on a second . 
  [ here you go !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fopyrhhlt3m ), 
  if you think the uk is reluctant to leave the eu , you have n't been paying attention . 
  farage is being worshipped as a prophet right now . 
  and i thought you had a better sense of humour . 
   to illegally cross the border only becomes a felony after the 15th . 
  okay , so this has been bugging me these past few weeks . 
  why are countries on the continent so bad at securing their own border ? 
  i know we 're cheating a bit with the 20 mile channel and 350ft cliffs , but even we are putting effort into it . 
  it 's like everyone else is n't even trying . 
  unless it 's publicly funded , then it should n't . 
  i fail to see how this migrant crisis will help poland fly into space . 
  and that 's what happens when you take people from illegal traffickers and not un camps . 
  you 're not rescuing people from war , you 're bringing it to your own doorstep . 
  sorry germany , switzerland , you 've brought this on yourselves . 
  in terms of people allowed to vote , no . 
  david cameron did though , and ukip got enough votes to establish themselves as the fourth main party of the united kingdom , upsetting the balance of having three main parties . 
  that 's ** huge .
