definitely , i remember having to do a short essay on whether haig was a ` butcher ' or ` hero ' during my year 9/10 history lessons ( which imo is a loaded question , but * c'est la vie * ) . 
  there 's certainly a glimmer , but the blackadder narrative still pervades the popular consciousness . 
  the main problem was that they had to fight 20th century defensive technology with 19th century offensive technology . 
  better artillery was needed to shell trenches , tanks were needed to storm trenches , and radios were needed to exploit openings . 
  these things did not for the most part exist until near the end of the war , and without them it was n't particularly possible to fight the war any other way . 
  it 's rather hard to summarise history into narratives , but very basically : generals did not spend all their time 40 miles behind the lines ; trench warfare * was * often successful , the problem was communications technology did not allow these tactical victories to be exploited ; there was little practical alternative to trench warfare again , due to technology - there was nothing available that could counter or outmanoeuvre entrenched positions ; generals like haig were fully aware of the casualties and bloodshed of the war , but as i said , there was little practical alternative to massed assaults until technology caught up . 
  there 's some great threads on / r/askhistorians , especially by / u/nnw that go into the subject in far more depth than i can that i recommend you to check out .

   never have happened if the likes of gladstone , disraeli same with the invasion of egypt or the first boer war , they would never have happened if gladstone were in charge . 
  the second anglo-afghan war would have likewise never happened if disraeli were in charge . 
  of course though , these wars * did * happen under their ` statesmanship ' the amount of ignorant worship of gladstone and disraeli and the do-no-wrong attitude many people assign to them is completely unwarranted . 
  they were n't mystic men leading britain to greatness - they were flawed men that made right decisions along with very wrong ones . 
  to treat gladstone , disraeli , or any other leader as saints is to do history a disservice . 
  as for british leadership at the start of the first world war , i 'll just point out that h.h. 
  asquith is often called ` gladstone without religion ' , it 's really quite humorous that you would decry him in favour of gladstone when they were very much built in the same mould . 
  the ` lions led by donkeys ' narrative is just as flawed as cameron 's hero-worship , if not more so as it 's still taught in schools along with that horribly misleading representation in blackadder . 
  the narrative you 're propagating is harmful and it 's a shame you 're being upvoted for spreading it . 
  i do n't know why they 're coloured differently , they 're just the bits of the ottoman empire that are/were in europe, 
  i do n't particularly trust iso on what constitutes a country - as you said , they thought wales a principality when it has n't had that status since 1542, 
  the government of the uk [ considers ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/administrative/the-countries-of-the-uk/index.html ) northern ireland a country, 
  nhs wales [ suffers ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10621931 ) from underfunding and fares badly in almost all metrics compared to nhs england . 
  it 's really not too grand . 
  financial services actually only make up 9.8 % of the uk economy and 3.6 % of jobs - manufacturing makes up a larger percentage of uk output at 10.8 % [ gross value added ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gross_value_added ) source : [ ons pdf ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;ved=0cgeqfjaf&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.parliament.uk%2fbriefing-papers%2fsn06193.pdf&amp;ei=e1ktustzlzo5haexzyhibg&amp;usg=afqjcnezicnqqfofygl83b22onddpz4_iw&amp;sig2=fyqw5kth4wcxrpdamvajzg&amp;bvm=bv.50952593,d.zg4&amp;cad=rja ), 
  there are quite a few treaties at paris , but i was referring to the [ 1814 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_paris_\\ ( 1814 \\ ) ) ( which reduced france to its 1792 borders ) and [ 1815 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_paris_\\ ( 1815 \\ ) ) treaties ( which reduced it to its 1790 borders and forced france to pay reperations ) . 
  it did until it lost to them and had most of its conquests revoked in the treaty of paris, 
  england [ has been ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_england ) invaded plenty of times since 1066 - louis the lion in 1216 , plenty of invasions by scotland , the deposition of edward ii by isabella of france in 1326 , the glorious revolution , glen shiel etc, 
   yes , italy ruled europe , for a while that 's probably the most anachronous sentence i 've ever seen on reddit . 
  rome was a city-state and was not synonymous with italy - the fact that being from a city on the ` italian ' peninsula did n't grant roman citizenship and the subsequent social war is evidence of that . 
   i like how during the french revolution , foreign countries tried to take advantage of it and started wars against france it was france 's declaration of war against austria that started the revolutionary wars ( using the declaration of pillnitz as justification ) , which resulted in prussia and the smaller german powers declaring on france in retaliation ( they were allied with austria ) . 
  france 's execution of louis xvi resulted in spain and portugal declaring war on france . 
  in 1793 france then declared war on the netherlands and britain . 
  the idea that france was a victim of countries taking advantage of its instability is simply untrue . 
   perhaps also that the romans built hadrians wall rather than take on scotland . 
  hadrian 's wall was built to demark the border of roman britain and to control trade , it was [ not built ] ( http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/09/roman-walls/curry-text ) as a defensive barrier or to keep the ` barbarians ' out, 
   moving from absolute monarchy to constitutional with parliament having more power the uk was not an absolute monarchy under james ii - he may have been * moving * the monarchy to absolutism , but this alleged process ( there 's historiographical debate over whether this move to absolutism was policy at all ) was never actually realised . 
  edit : repeated myself . 
   ( 1881 ) you mean 1871 , right ? 
  i swear / r/europe is just [ / r/crosspostthingstodowitheurope ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe ) at this point , you did n't even bother to change the incorrect title, 
  of course , but the sheer amount of cypriots that go to uk universities is odd considering it 's such a small country that has such a large presence . 
  to be fair , there 's been no reason for invaders to hold the whole of scotland - the northern extreme is useless mountains . 
  scotland had a big advantage in that for the most part the land just was n't very desirable . 
  or elba , if you want a choice of ` exile islands ' . 
  he was born and raised on corsica so that makes the most sense . 
  he 's on corsica , that 's the right island . 
  he 's guaranteed a referendum before and not delivered - remember the ` cast iron guarantee ' ? 
  i do n't think that would ever happen , the labour backbench would tear the leadership apart for even contemplating getting into bed with ukip . 
  labour is divided enough over the eu , never mind immigration . 
  ukips stance on climate change and gay marriage does n't make it a credible party for labour to form a coalition with either . 
  if this happens then i 'll be absolutely shocked - it 'd ruin the reputation of labour among moderates . 
  the largest northern irish party that 's conservative/unionist is the dup and they only won 8 seats in 2010 , even a dilapidated libdem party will likely win more seats than that . 
  if the tories are in a position as to need the dup , then it 's more likely that labour would coalition with plaid/snp/ld / alliance/green and form a government . 
  i would n't say the libdems face certain destruction , they still retain their 8 % core vote that 's not going away any time soon . 
  that 8 % is pretty concentrated in a few regions too , so translates well to seats - it 's quite likely they 'll end up with quite a few more seats than ukip , even if ukip beats them at the polls . 
  i thought it was a jibe at how many ukip flaired users there are . 
  it 's for the most part an indicator that the place was a roman encampment ( manchester , colchester , chester etc ) , though it 's not wholly the case . 
  - cester or - chester means either camp , fortress , or ( in anglo-saxon ) town . 
  manchester should either be breast-like hill camp or mother camp ( supplement camp with fortress , town , or marching camp ), 
  [ norway has adopted three quarters of eu legislation ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16594370 ) [ norway implements roughly 75 % of eu laws ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/matspersson/100022087/brixit-why-the-norwegian-model-simply-wouldnt-work-for-the-uk/ ), 
  under the eea we 'd still have to enforce around 70 % of eu legislation without any voice , and we 'd have to pay for it without the rebate . 
  the map is n't correct in that . 
  south tyrol wants to unite with north tyrol and become an austrian state , not independence . 
   once the uk managed to get some democracy and affairs ran by no longer just the aristocrats the majority of the people were for irish home rule . 
  not really . 
  irish home rule nearly destroyed the liberal party and helped destroy the reputation of gladstone . 
  it was not at all a popular policy and is one of the reasons the conservatives were in power from 1886-1905 . 
  the governments of gladstone himself after 1866 were propped up by the irish parliamentarians and would n't have seen power without them due to the home rule bills . 
  it 's a perfect example of the anachronistic policies of the liberal party , it was not a vote winner and not popular among the largely unionist general public . 
  it 's not particularly accurate to say that the majority of people were in favour of home rule - at the most you could say they 'd rather home rule than independence . 
  i did n't claim that wales was particularly diverse - in fact it 's the least diverse country in the uk , i merely pointed out that ` ethnically ' wales is not homogeneous . 
  this fact will likely not make it through to you however , as you seem to have a bee in your bonnet about ethnicity being a synonym of race . 
  i do enjoy your shifting of the goalposts vis-a-vis welsh ethnicity though . 
  74 % of people in wales claim welsh ethnicity , with 30 % being born outside the country . 
  what were you saying about homogeneity ? 
  switzerland , belgium , and spain are also more ethnically diverse than the usa - of course ` generally ' is a nice save when what you mean is n. america is more diverse , except when it is n't like in most carribean islands . 
  but please , continue to tell me that nationalism is n't about nations , continue to argue that ethnicity and the nation are not inexplicably linked . 
  so what you 're saying is american nationalism is based on the nation , while all other ** nation ** alisms are in fact based on ethnicity . 
  i do n't think i need to point out how little sense that makes . 
  you also conflate ethnicity with race , ignoring that a large part of what makes up ethnicity is the experience of nationhood ( though not necessarily of a nation state ) . 
  regardless of how nonsensical your post is however , it 's also completely wrong . 
  arguably the first truly nationalist state was france during the french revolution . 
  france however was not a unified ethnicity , it was n't even a united language - less than 50 % of ` frenchmen ' actually spoke the language in 1789 . 
  occitan , flemish , picard , catalan , breton , alsatian , franonian et al were all disparate ethnicities united by the idea of the ` french ' nation . 
  nationalism in the prototypical nationalist state was n't about ethnicity at all , it was about ignoring individual ethnicities in favour of the larger nation . 
  american nationalism is n't unique because it 's about the nation , all nationalisms are about the nation - it 's in the name . 
  because the kingdom of england does n't exist . 
  it 's not pedantry - someone asked a question and you were wrong , and it 's only right that someone corrected you . 
  not really true , do you have any evidence on that besides your feelings ? 
  that does n't align with any polling or [ census data ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/2011censuskeystatisticsforwales/2012-12-11 ) i 've ever seen . 
  58 % of people in wales describe their national identity as ` welsh only ' , 7 % as ` welsh and british ' , 17 % as ` only british ' , and 13.8 % as any kind of english identity . 
  hardly the kind of numbers you 'd expect to find for a region of england compare with cornwall where only [ 13.8 % of people ] ( http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_290558.pdf ) living there identify as cornish at all ( either solely , or alongside another identity ) . 
  in scotland the figures are only slightly higher than wales - 62 % of people in scotland describe themselves as ` scottish only ' . 
   it problems are of it 's own making care to elaborate ? 
  plaid have been the second largest party in the senedd in all but one assembly election since it was founded almost 20 years ago - nothing to do with the current situation with the libdems or labour , the latter of which is relatively resilient to corbyn 's unpopularity . 
  i would n't conflate voting for plaid as necessarily wanting independence though, 
  no , not without something quite drastic happening . 
  if you look at polling for independence 5 years ago in 2012 [ around 10 % ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/voters-would-say-no-independent-2040972 ) of people supported independence in a straight yes-no poll .
