  yes voter here . 
  [ how i 'm feeling right now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1tjjo_pvvq ), 
  sorry , but i 'm sceptical of anything coming out of london atm , as they may be a * little bit biased *, 
   scotland will be seen as a risky investment citation ? 
   `` when we 're independent , the first thing we 'll do is demand england underwrites all our debt in a currency union !, 
  if it does n't , we 'll just default ! '', 
  default is not the right term as scotland will have no legal obligation to pay . 
  uk has stated it will assume all debts and treaties . 
  [ response from alex salmond ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=6jo113ljqb0 ), 
  osborne and better together have brought us here . 
  a currency union was the best option for everybody and it was ruled out purely to try intimidate scotland into voting no . 
  sorry am i causing you to stray off message ? 
  do n't worry you can keep telling everybody this is just scotland 's problem and we 'll all just pretend your boy osborne is n't fucking the whole of the uk here . 
  scotland wo n't be independent till 2016 , what happens in the meantime ? 
  i 'll take them over the fucking austrian school idiots like cotton any day . 
  did you read this part of the article ? 
   deutsche bank economists warned of the impact a yes vote could have . 
  `` it could at worst lead to a ** destabilising crisis in the whole british banking system ** , '' they said , `` and at best leave the rest of the uk with an unstable currency union in which the bank of england is ** forced to continue to provide liquidity to scottish banks while westminster thrashes out a fiscal and monetary arrangement with a new scottish sovereign government holding all the cards ** . 
  a yes vote could easily derail the uk economic recovery . '', 
  osborne is going to run the ** uk ** economy over a cliff to prevent scotland leaving . 
  i wonder why they have the comments off on that article ? 
   you are a representative democracy . 
  not representative or democratic enough . 
  hence the referendum . 
   you do n't think that 's going to be hurt ? 
  you do n't think our closest ally loosing not only a good chunk of their hard power , but a good chunk of their soft power as well is n't going to adversely affect my country ? 
  [ not really ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2013/04/blogs/graphic-detail/20130420_gdc836.png ), 
  the problem is maintaining that `` massive influence and economic clout '' is taking a toll on the people of the uk . 
  we are unwilling allies , literally millions took to the streets to protest against the iraq . 
  our healthcare , welfare and education have been sacrificed in order to provide that clout . 
  the scots simply have a way out of this mess , and we may well take it . 
   our strongest ally could be crippled . 
  you 're just being melodramatic here . 
  yeah lets blame the pregnant woman for letting cops beat the shit out her . 
  he 's married to a german , so i suspect it 's probably a family member or friends business . 
  he 's probably skiming party funds into a swiss account . 
  it really is staggering to me how people can completely fail to grasp the very basics of how the internet actually functions and yet they have the authority to make decisions like this . 
  they 're poor horrible deformed things . 
  thankfully , i 've never actually seen one in scotland though . 
  shirley you must have fuckwitted racist morons in canada as well ? 
  the industrial revolution . 
  rtfa . 
  grumble grumble grumble, 
  scotland would be very different . 
  stop feeding them . 
  if someone is being a dick , just downvote them a move on . 
  if no one bothers to reply to their shit they 'll get bored and move on . 
  ignoring these fuckers is hellish for them . 
   stay home glasgow bros. . no chance . 
  anyway , this is a complete load of shite . 
  when has a terrorist attack ever appeared in the papers before it actually happens ? 
  how 's is this relevant to / r/europe though ? 
  / r/paris sure , / r/france maybe , but / r/europe - no way . 
  the only reason to post this here is to try and stir up shit . 
  is / r/europe being infiltrated by far right groups again ? 
  hooray , i love any excuse to post [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpn69cv1le4 ), 
  mate , you do n't have a fucking clue what you 're talking about so just leave it . 
  [ i hate reddit nazis . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ukfavyp3uu ), 
  we had no mass media to cover them , so what would be the point ? 
  that 's because we nipped it in the bud . 
  hungerford saw the ban on semi-auto rifles and dunblane brought about the handgun ban . 
  i agree , but i do n't mean to say that i think the us wants a weak eu , just an eu weaker than the us . 
   american taxpayer is increasingly inclined to let europe pay for its share of defending them militarily . 
  american taxpayers wo n't get a say in this , this is in the strategic interests of the us . 
  if the eu had the capability of defending itself then what would they need the us ( and their bases ) for ? 
   let 's be honest , many muslims do n't want to assimilate i do n't think assimilation is really such a big deal , the chinese , indians , and caribbean migrants did n't have to abandon their culture and traditions to to live peacefully and happily in western societies . 
  all our problems with muslim immigrants stems from wahhabism . 
  it 's probably best described as weaponized religion , funded by saudi / opec oil money and aimed at the west . 
  the real question imo is why do we let them get away with it ? 
  imo , * < puts on tinfoil hat  * europe is to dependant on me oil to take unilateral action ( e.g sanctions ) and the us is quite happy to see a divided and weakened eu ( not too weak mind you , just not in a position to challenge the us globally ) so it does n't bring any real pressure to bear on the saudis . 
  sounds similar to the stasi technique of [ zersetzung ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stasi#zersetzung ), 
  the mods are n't and most of the original users are still here so there is still hope . 
  provocation ? 
   it 's unbelievable that the police was afraid to go inside this plaza literally . 
   i 've seen situations where tv-journalists are attacked in a similar manner here 's how aussie journalists normally get attacked : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_5xb-9ww_w,

  i recently took part in a sleep study run by cambridge researchers which allowed me to get the 12 week plan from https://www.sleepio.com/ for free . 
  it 's not the sort of thing i 'd normally ever consider doing , but i was pleasantly surprised how effective it was . 
  it 's sort of a mix of learning good sleep hygiene and some cbt techniques .

   `` women should in general not go out on the streets at night alone , they should avoid suspicious looking areas and also when in pubs and clubs should only accept drinks from people they know . '' is the one of the blandest , most common sense non-statements i 've ever read .
