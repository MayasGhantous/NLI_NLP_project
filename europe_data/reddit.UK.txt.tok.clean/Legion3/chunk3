  in this modern civilisation , nationalism is on the decline , especially in europe , which is why in my opinion , the european states should unite like the american states did . 
  it would be beneficial for all . 
  but , the commemorations and ceremonies were created in such a time when nationalism was one country . 
  however , anyone can draw from the sacrifice that they made . 
  hell , i 'd say everyone involved in that war had a `` stiff upper lip '' and that any person could , and should draw from the sacrifice and determination the soldiers had , not the commanders and leaders . 
  anyone . 
  that 's why the ceremonies are open to all . 
  we are n't limiting it to just britions . 
  the ideal is , `` this is what our citizens have done in the past , this is what we as a nation , and as a planet/society/people / species can do . 
  humans can overcome adversity . 
  they died for british people . 
  yes they died for britain , but to them britain was the people . 
  the country and people were one . 
  the millions were n't there to push imperialistic standpoints . 
  they were there to defend their towns , their villages their families and communities . 
  lest we forget means that we must not forget their sacrifice . 
  their sacrifice shall not be in vain means that we must not repeat the sins that led up to that . 
  i do not see the glorifications their , i do not see the love of war there . 
  i see the people commemorating the men who , naively gave their lives for their families . 
  the pm during ww1 is hardly remembered , nor the cabinet , kitchener is known by some . 
  it 's not the same as monty , churchill , or even the american generals . 
  the honour that is given to the dead and commanders of ww2 is vastly different to ww1 if you said that the commemorations of ww2 are glorifying war , then you would be right . 
  because their was a clear right and wrong . 
  the nazis were evil we were good . 
  there 's no debate . 
  but the commemorations , ceremonies of ww1 are vastly different . 
  i 'd say it was austria 's fault for both wars ... 
  i mean hitler was austrian . 
  and the austrian deceleration of war on serbia triggered russia to come defend , which triggered france , then austria called upon germany to aid , and because of alliances germany came , but they invaded through belgium , which drew britain into the fold . . 
  you do n't understand . 
  the image that many britons get from ww1 of what it means to be british is to have a stiff upper lip and to struggle through the hardest of times . 
  now the knowledge that war is fucking horrible and should be avoided at all cost is engrained . 
  you want to know the reason for appeasement with hitler ? 
  ww1 and the way the british , belgium , french and the rest of the world interpret it . 
  but critically the british , in this case . 
  it 's not romantic the `` mates too the end '' it defines what it means to be british . 
  but overlayed with it all , from our schooling , is that war is fucking crap and must be avoided . 
  is that these men were living in despicable conditions that no person should endure . 
  and we commemorate the people for enduring that . 
  because they were able to endure that . 
  that they stood for what they believed in . 
  we do n't romanticise it like shakespears henry v at agincort , where death on the battle field is to be desired . 
  death in such a manner is to hated , and despised . 
  however , when a person is faced with the situation of do or die , the british nationalism is trying to instil a stiff upper lip and endure . 
  but , we want to avoid being faced with the circumstances that make us have a stiff upper lip , we 'd rather not be tested on our mettle and courage , but the memorials are there to show our nation that when the test came we rose to the challenge , but let their sacrifice not be in vain , which means , do not let the freedom they fought for be lost to war and violence . 
  to not repeat the sins of the past . 
  lest we forget . 
  do not forget the sacrifices these men gave for the privilege you enjoy , and do n't spoil it by repeating the situations that led up to such a critical point that it was do or die . 
  when we were tested . 
  maybe the governments and the reasons for the war are blurred . 
  but the matter of the fact is that the citizenry , who truely believed in their hearts of hearts that their lives were in danger , their whole way of life , civilisation and nationalism was in stake . 
  they believed the krauts were inherintaley evil . 
  and to the citizens it was a do or die situation . 
  and what happened , when the empire called her citizens came to her aid . 
  the people defended their national interest , but what they signed up for was to save their villages , towns , friends and family . 
  and when these people were facing the `` enemy '' on the front line of a new type of war that no one had ever witnessed . 
  the en mass anhiliation of battalions , regiments , companies , they stood by their mates and died defending their friends and family . 
  that is why they are heroes . 
  that is why they are commemorated . 
  not because the brits were good and the deutsche were bad . 
  but because they stood with their mates too the end . 
  mate ship that can never be broken . 
  yeah , why is it always either the us or russia/china recently . 
  ca n't some people forge their own way ? 
   i think people ~ ~ being unable to process a simple article ~ ~ * believing what the daily mail writes without more evidence * is a bigger threat to society ... ftfy, 
  when i read the first part of your comment i was quite off put . 
  i continued reading and i think i grasp your underlying statement . 
  however , stating that people need to realise the real intentions of islam is a bit off in my opinion . 
  whilst many people of the islamic faith are raving bloody loonies , the religion as a whole does n't have one driving intention to destroy the rest . 
  your sentiment overall is good , i feel , just your first sentence would off put a ton of people and polarise any discussion , again , in my opinion . 
  the mail is not even a bloody newspaper . 
  they do n't give you news . 
  just some biased view point on the news . 
  emperor protect her glorious buttocks !, 
  and so putin does what ? 
  intervene to save a failing dictator from brutal jihadist elements . 
  same shit just a different day . 
  except we do have this funny quirk called responsible government , which basically means that if the government goes against what the people have made clear they want , i.e. 
  a referendum result , the queen gives them a good boot up the arse and we hold new elections . 
  genocide : the deliberate killing of a large group of people , especially those of a particular nation or ethnic group . 
  i believe the rhetoric of slaughtering a good portion of the population of libya is genocide . 
  you mean gaddafi right , dictator of libya ? 
  so when he was saying that the rebels were `` cockroaches '' who needed to be `` stomped out '' we should have just left the state alone and allow a genocide to occur ? 
  the rebels had no air support , minimal aa , not much armour and gaddafi was going to utilise his whole military capacity to utterly crush them . 
  whilst we fucked up ** after ** the libyan intervention , the actual intervention and handling of the intervention was perfectly planned executed . 
  however , the western world wanted to just get out as fast as possible and not commit to actually helping the state rebuild , fill the power vacuum and properly finish the mission . 
  and the reason why our leaders chose that ? 
  because godamn civvies bitch and moan if we committed . 
  it costs money , time and lives . 
  there 's no simple fix , there 's no way in hell you can stabilise a state within 6 months ( as the us said they would in 2003 with iraq ) . 
  it requires decades , huge amounts of resources and actual commitment . 
  no , we never tried it properly . 
  every single time we 've attempted `` nation building '' recently ** everyone ** has wanted to get out before their hands get dirty and before proper commitment . 
  look at libya , we just bailed . 
  iraq , we did n't have enough troops nor enough support or anything which can aid nation building . 
  rwanda we again , just bailed . 
  somalia , bailed when it got too tough . 
  really only timor-leste has become stable after an intervention because they did n't break down into civil war and actually were able to stabilise themselves . 
  however , if we actually put in decades rather than months , actually committed the resources required and not just using the military . 
  because shockingly , the military ca n't build a nation .
