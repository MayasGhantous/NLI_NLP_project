   bribe libya right , after we left their country in a shit heap because we just removed their government , let 's give that unstable state money and it 'll just stop . 
  also what happened to innocent until proven guilty . 
  just because he crashed does n't mean he 's at fault as you say . 
  also he could 've hit a low pressure pocket causing the plane to rapidly descend and gain velocity making a manoeuvre neigh impossible . 
  the stick could 've stuck . 
  the flaps . 
  a million things . 
  and to u/dorfidiot many people crash all the time resulting in fatalities and do n't immediately get hauled to jail . 
  there 's a process and investigations to be done , and even then if the guy is n't at fault ** he wo n't be punished for something that is n't his godamn fault **, 
  wiki leaks is stupid and is n't the god like creation of assange and his glory freedom rousing bullshit like a lot of people like to believe, 
  they already lost it . 
  what else is there to loose ? 
  so we 're gon na just sit there on our bloody moral high grounds and do nothing ? 
  we wo n't even try to defend people , who believe in the same things , from someone who clearly does n't ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  just save us ? 
  everyone else is just what ? 
  americans . 
  not reasonable , have anurisms every time, 
  they also have forced labour camps that double as death camps . 
  aside from the no food issue , it 's fucked up objectively . 
  so stability is the only deciding factor . 
  well shit , that 's good to know . 
  guess we can leave all dictators , facists , racist , and other untoward states alone because they 're `` stable '' . 
  shit , it never occurred to me that people do n't deserve to be treated like human beings , that slavery is fine , and all this as long as the state is stable . 
  ( again , more / s ), 
  because they have a culture it 's not `` wrong '' it 's just their culture . 
  so my family totally has the `` culture '' of going around slaughtering people , and incest ( / s if you have n't caught on yet ) but you ca n't say i 'm wrong , because my familiar culture just `` split '' from yours , and it 's totally not backwards , archaic and stupid . 
  see what i 'm getting at ? 
  oh , so the vietnamese refugees from the vietnam war , who had nothing , who fled to australia , who make up a solid portion of the middle class , were all middle classers and came with everything they needed and not the clothes on their back . 
  the indians who came to the uk , some were upper class , some middle , many lower class . 
  yet they 're not blowing themselves up in our buses . 
  racism :  the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race , especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races . 
  prejudice , discrimination , or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one 's own race is superior . 
  nothing about `` power '' or `` oppressing '' . 
  it is in ** no ** way the `` agreed academic definition '' unless your academics are also the people saying vaccines cause cancer and crap . 
  you got downvoted for making a good point . 
  everyone can be racist . 
  everyone can be horribly fucking racism . 
  and `` affirmative action '' bullshit ought to end . 
  in the end racism is racism , just move along people . 
  americans on the other hand ... 
  economic benefits , safety , rights , liberty and basically everything the west stands for . 
  nauru does n't count . 
  that 's where the australian government process and detains all asylum seekers . 
  whilst you 're sort of right , it 's not just due to social benefits . 
  in muslim cukture , especially the really religious lot , the women do n't work and therefore do n't have to interact with any nationals ( it 's not as i say , it 's a term ) so they just interact with their own people, 
  well hang on a minute here . 
  no one , in this whole thread , complete racists and nutters aside , are saying that all are bad . 
  it 's illogical that statement . 
  but again , anecdotal evidence that you 've given is n't the be all and end all . 
  for example , i 'm from sydney and know a lot of muslim people . 
  they generaly come from western sydney , and in the news it gets bad press because bikie violence , and they have a higher crime rate per capita than any other general area in sydney . 
  the racists and idiots will say then `` all muslims are bad export them . 
  simply not true . 
  i could say `` i know muslims who are great people , all are good . '', 
  again not true ( not the point you were making ) . 
  but the unbiased statistics show there 's an issue that needs to be rectified . 
  and it wo n't come if people either say , get rid of them all , or say armchair generals shit . 
  because you 're also being an armchair general . 
  we need to approach this with the immigrants who have integrated help . 
  well yes and no . 
  if they go and get a job anyway , it does n't ensure that they will integrate anyway . 
  whilst being jobless and loving on welfare does n't help the migrants , or their kids . 
  however , the biggest factor that i 've found to integration is whether they live in isolated communities , thus do n't interact with nationals . 
  to be clear , i 'm not saying that they can have no communities of their home country peoples . 
  but these communities can not be too large that people can live there and not interact , and thus integrate , with nationals of that state . 
  yeah down in australia we do that . 
  we have centres to process them ( whilst not on australian soil i disagree with , yadda yadda ) but there 's a huge fucking stink and kick up about it . 
  whilst the leftists did n't actually do anything or get anything to change , there 's a lot of yelling and screaming . 
  but their solution is just let everyone in and do n't bother with paper work , or background checks or anything . 
  difference is , 100 rounds for the g36 . 
  and a few thousand for the ak, 
  the g36 has a major flaw , and the bundeswehr has repeatedly stated this . 
  not the cdp politicians , or the minister for defence , but ranking bundeswehr officers , and many of the rank and file . 
  fact is the g36 loses accuracy when heated due to the barrel glue melting or some bullshit . 
  and that 's running a few mags through the rifle . 
  that 's completely unacceptable for the primary rifle of a military, 
   desperate lugged it all the way through germany to make it to denmark . 
  sounds completely desperate to me ... / s, 
  frenchman - likes : war studies : war stuff dis german ist nicht correct !, 
  so , turkey shoots down russian aircraft = cold war ... hmm , so why when in the '50s the us and the ussr were shooting down each others aircraft , yet we did n't have nuclear war . 
  invading , yes that is the appropriate use of the word , a sovereign state 's airspace is legitimately an act of war via invasion . 
  which warrants shooting down of said aircraft . 
  if russia in this scenario then tries to hit back at turkey , they will be hit harder by the west for striking a nato state . 
  putin is n't pants on head retarded . 
  he is n't going to declare war over shooting down of one aircraft . 
  so when does planning stop being thinking and becomes the intent ? 
  because even if i had all the plans and the gear to commit the attack , you still can not prove i was intending to do the attack other than just thinking about it , technically ( and oh boy is that one big technicality ) . 
  i agree that change should come from within the system itself . 
  sometimes you need an exterior force to ensure that the system changes and copes with the change effectively . 
  and in my ( worthless ) opinion , these types of people that we need to change , do n't seem to be affected by the attitudes and responses of those within the system , just bullheadedly continuing . 
  so it makes it improbable that the change can come from within . 
  if you 're talking about the attempts at appeasement of britain and chamberlan prior to wwii . 
  you 're talking a lot of crock mate . 
  we wanted appeasement back then , specifically because we did n't want a war . 
  we barely increased defence spending , and was still caught with our pants down . 
  what you said may be a possible reason for appeasement , but that was n't the notion behind wwii british appeasement of nazi germany . 
  for the fundamentalists , yes . 
  for the majority of muslims , islam covers their whole private life , but no the public .
