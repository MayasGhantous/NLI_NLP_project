  [ 5 ] in response , the georgian government cut diplomatic relations with russia . 
  [ 58 ] several weeks after signing the agreement , russia pulled most of its troops out of georgia proper . 
  [ 59 ] in the aftermath russia 's international relations were largely unharmed . 
  [ 60 ] the war displaced 192,000 people , [ 61 ] and while many returned to their homes after the war , 20,272 persons remain displaced as of 2014 . 
  [ 62 ] russian forces remain in abkhazia and south ossetia under agreements with the corresponding governments . 
  [ 6 ] georgia and its western allies consider abkhazia and south ossetia as occupied by russia , in violation of the ceasefire . 
  that 's a shockingly dumb opinion . 
  i 'm not arguing against that , but i think a large part of it is also that decisions inevitably have to be made by somebody , and you ca n't submit everything to a vote . 
  when you say remove all the elites you are talking about removing all people in positions of power though . 
  and i guess , removing positions of power entirely . 
  you are talking about wealth redistribution at this point however , and that 's a tricky thing . 
  i 'm sorry , i just want to be clear on this : the irish famine was the fault of the stupid , greedy irish and england 's hands are clean . 
  that 's your arguement ? 
  that 's what it is , right ? 
  what the fuck are you on about . 
  that 's so fucking beautiful , jesus christ . 
  if he does n't find a way to repair the ongoing damage to his country 's reputation , trade ties and economy this is actually probably the russian people 's first real chance of being rid of putin since he installed himself as tzar . 
  and another thing !, 
  why are n't the chinese sinocrats ? 
  that makes about as much sense as calling us eurocrats . 
  this is far from the truth and anyone who 's been paying any attention to what 's actually being signed knows the ball is not in russia 's court on anything here . 
  and in 5 years you 'll be saying exactly the opposite . 
  what a complete fucking farce of an article indicative of a farce of a writer . 
  there 's a long-promoted culture of apathy there the likes of which the world has rarely seen , coupled with a self-pitying view of their own history where they somehow think their country has * super * suffered more than anyone else you guys , for real . 
  paging / u/vigorous to substantiate this scurrilous rumour . 
  i can see uses for this saying , but not many . 
  do n't feed the shills . 
  yeah , this is so not ireland hosting nazis . 
  this is you realizing you 've talked some shit and ca n't back it up . 
  fuck back off to your paymasters in moscow , shill . 
  i 'm reporting you too . 
  no one believes you , shill . 
  you can just replace all your text with the phrase `` idiot shill disgraces himself '' buddy , everybody 's onto you now . 
  that was completely unreadable . 
  getting started early on our shilling today , are we ? 
  when are you going to drop the facade of being a canadian and admit to being a paid russian shill ? 
  abe lincoln called confederate forces enemy soldiers and sent tens of thousands of men to kill them . 
  he likes whoever he 's told to like and everyone else gets pun names . 
  this is a really great stream of conversation for what is a really black and white arguement , the critical point not being the validity of the elections or the ukranian government but the integrity of several prolific pro-russian posters on these boards . 
  i 'm sorry , but please remember that russia is special , and therefore not culpable to the criticisms it levels at other nations . 
  looking at your post history does n't compel one to treat your arguements with any credibility . 
  there 's no way this makes any sense . 
  i 'm surprised this has been up this long without being called western propaganda and dismissed out of hand in a pile of broken english jargon . 
  the implication being that established political parties are trustworthy ? 
  i 'm an inglishmun and i have no desire to see my country leave the eu and it 's thoroughly frustrating to hear it brought up so constantly . 
  russia 's plan of `` constantly assume everyone else are complete fucking idiots '' seems to be proceeding ahead of steam . 
  they ** fired ** on the russian column ? 
  that ca n't be right , putin would be invading * right now . 
  so they just ... did n't want to go back to india ? 
  i mean , fair play to them , i guess . 
  i woulda picked somewhere less denmarky myself . 
  can we get a reverse of that world series wins by country image ? 
  it 's nice to see him getting some klosure . 
  do you ever just sit and read what you type ? 
  you 're all right , fella . 
  he never actually reads what anybody says before he responds to it . 
  a literal paid russian agent calling me a troll . 
  that 's charming . 
  it 's almost like everyone ignores you because you are fucking crazy . 
  vigorous is a russian shill account . 
  you really wo n't get any intelligent conversation out of him . 
  i had n't actually thought about that , but that does seem rather likely now . 
  i love the random line questioning hilary 's background . 
  where are the birth certificates , hilary ? 
  this guy here , this guy gets it . 
  i 'm so angry i 'm going to refer to your country as holland . 
  a rather great litmus test for any russian poster here is their opinion of thei maidan . 
  if they can accept that an entire country rose up against their smothering interests through the man their government had paid to act against his own country 's interests , then they can be acknowledged as a reasonable person willing to accomodate other arguements and who can potentially sway a debate in his favour through reason . 
  if they argue that the sustained , peaceful protests of 40,000 people in the capital and thousands elsewhere , bringing the country to a standstill and enduring their corrupt russian-bought president ordering his men to ** shoot his own people ** , if they argue that is somehow some bizarre , absurd eu-us fantasy conspiracy ( where for some reason it would benefit the eu to have neo-nazis in power in a neighbouring nation of 44 million ) to bully poor , tiny , defenseless , non-aggressive russia , then those people are shills.they will never acknowledge the faults of their own side because in their world these things ** can not ** exist or everything they 've argued is a lie . 
  you clearly are a shall . 
  you 've set up a world where russia is the lone , heroic crusader against the evil , imperialistic , has-beaten-russia-at-every-stage us , and their vassals ( vassals !, 
  the fucking ** nerve ** of you !! ), 
  the eu ( more populous than the us ) , japan ( went to war with the us ) motherfucking muslim oil nations bahrain and saudi arabia ( surely the simplest reason all these nations are criticising russia is because the us is secretly controlling them , rather than russia ever , ever , ever , ever , ever being in the wrong ) . 
  i mean , that would mean the coup was n't it a coup but an organic protest pushed to violence by moscow 's actions through their crony , and that the following illegal invasion of ukraine was an illegal invasion , and that the lies about `` little green men '' in crimea were lies , and that the trucks full of `` secession '' votes in the donbas implicated russia in the planned , sustained and deliberate destabilization of a neighbouring peaceful state that they share history and culture with in order to fill the pockets of putin and his inner circle !, 
  that would be horrible , would n't it / u/djmedic ? 
  that would make you look uncomfortably at yourself and perhaps make you re-evaluate your hilariously bizarre worldviews . 
  i 'm sure setting yourself up in a russia-versus-the-world mentality would n't warp your opinions or hurt you in the long run . 
  i 've no idea why you think anyone is beholden to provide you with youtube videos , of all things . 
  i * certainly * do n't care what you say you believe or not , you are clearly arguing in bad faith and wo n't address arguements . 
  you are the one arguing it does n't . 
  one of the founding principles of the eu was to prevent a repeat of ww2 through closer diplomatic and economic integration . 
  and sure enough , the greatest threat in the european theatre is a beligerent great power with an outdated political theory who is n't a member of this club . 
  i mean , you probably know this , but it 's obvious looking at your post history you are here to argue an agenda , so i 've already given up on you actually surprising anyone with a cogent arguement . 
  he just got banned from / r/russia last week after ( as the mod put it ) shitposting and sassing a mod after being given a second chance . 
  yeah , he was banned from the subreddit he 's shilling for * twice * . 
  no idea when the / r/worldnews ban happened . 
  military men like former-ukranian army or former-russian army ? 
  you are the one presenting the arguement !, 
  this means you have to substantiate it !, 
  seriously man are russians debate teams just like `` just talk about iraq and assume everyone else gets tired and goes home '' and that 's it ? 
  holy fuck . 
  it 's only good-looking because it 's polished and in a showroom . 
  when it 's out on the streets that 'll look like an 80s cassette player sucking people inside . 
  you have n't proven your point at all ; you 've offered zero rebuttal to the text that i helpfully quoted for you twice and , just like every russian shill here , you ca n't morally argue your point so you 've tried to convince me that `` the west '' ( a nebulous body at best consisting of up to 100 nations depending on how persecuted moscow is feeling on any particular day ) has double standards , as if this in any way justifies ** armed invasion of a peaceful neighbour . 
  ** congratulations , mr shill , you 've failed . 
  oh dear , my post history confirms that i 've got an agenda and now i 'm upset when people are calling me on it . 
  it 's not surprising how you are sounding more and more like just another boring shill . 
  ah yes , an arguement that nobody is making . 
  good to know you are simply an isolated idiot wasting everyone 's time then . 
  defend your point or you concede your arguement as invalid .
