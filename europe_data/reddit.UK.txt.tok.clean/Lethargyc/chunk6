  i agree with you though , he 's really damaging arguements that better pro-russian posters could be making . 
  you 've never addressed a single arguement put forward in your entire history of shilling . 
  you just spam links to whatever unrelated shite you like . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  try and actually answer a debate for once you weird russian shill . 
  ha , i knew we had our heads about us . 
  i agree . 
  that 's the benefit of them being cunts and united , and us being reasonable and divided . 
  we should 've been in there a year ago , we should be in there now . 
  no they wo n't . 
  if nato goes in there , the smell of russian piss mingling with combat linen will be wafting all across the donbas . 
  aside from the fact that russia would never attack a nato country because they 'd get their balls chopped off and hung from the front door of the white house and buckingham palace , i remember a lot of talk about how there 's no reason that russia would ever attack their brothers in ukraine either . 
  ah yes , the infamous `` hive mind '' , long-time nebulous foe of the butt-hurt and poorly-informed alike . 
  any argument for why they are attacking ukraine could be applied to finland with minimal revisions . 
  large country , strategically important , sound , stable economy , longtime ally of nato states , already in several alliances with existing nato states , modern military , modern infrastructure , friendly to nato , potentially at odds with russia : yup , we 'll take 'em . 
  or the *** hms you , outside , now ***, 
  or the recently commissioned *** hms oi , d'you want some ? 
  not enough , at a guess . 
  seriously guys , this is fucking important . 
  boil him in fondue it is . 
  not if you 're a cunt , no . 
  it 's so embarrassing to hear a head of state , a prominent one in the dominant body in europe , talk about `` impressing '' the tinpot dictator of some country somewhere . 
  the spin we hear coming out of it will be * legendary . 
  i 'd back a kickstarter to have blatter kicked in the dick on live television . 
  * ah bloo bla bloo * daddy do n't take me seriously * a bloo bla bloo bloo *, 
  the hyperbole of ** your ** own statement is akin to propaganda . 
  except yours actually * is * hyperbole , considering / u/nilbop is correct in stating that dozens and dozens of far-right groups across the eu receive kremlin funding . 
  but sure go on and talk out of your ass . 
  exactly the same as russia 's military situation . 
  we use it . 
  no conflict in ukraine is in the interest of the eu , which a large , unified army would have deterred . 
  as it is a potentially massively productive member state ( think poland but larger ) is being cannibalized by an aggressor state acting contrary to our interests . 
  if ukraine is to be allowed to get it 's house in order , this conflict must be ended first and we are the best people to look after our own house . 
  and do n't speak for germany , or any other state for that matter . 
  they wo n't leave , and certainly not because you do n't like the idea of an army . 
  wow , you really are having a breakdown . 
  you should probably step away from the computer . 
  ooh , one more !, 
  * i ca n't find any evidence of you attacking amerikkka so i 'm going to backoff from that point and hope nobody notices !, 
  gosh i wonder what it 's like to live in narnia whenever the big , mean real world changes in ways you do n't like . 
  sorry , ca n't hear you over those sour grapes . 
  are you referring to yourself as an island ? 
  you are aware that the echr and the hra are different items and the conflict between them is part of the entire point of this ? 
  good . 
  forcing more engagement with the eu and tweaking international legislation is the way to move forward to a more cohesive and effective eu that 's not mired in bureaucracy , not sticking our fat fingers in our ears and hoping we do n't hear anything . 
  ah , the wonderful ongoing legacy of the soviet union . 
  you 've always got doctor who . 
  islands are special . 
  we are n't . 
  we did n't vote for ukip so you 're party lost . 
  sorry old bean . 
  we 'll be forging a future with the rest of europe and you can return to your magical medieval fief in the back of your own mind . 
  you believe in a britain removed from the eu that castrates it 's political , diplomatic , economic , military and judicial futures at any cost . 
  the rest of us accept that , but disagree . 
  your views seem entirely based on your idealized world view of england sitting alone in a bubble untouchable by the rest of the world and reaping only benefits at no cost , while simultaneously disregarding it 's formative hands in things like the echr . 
  it 's always been ludicrous and now that your future is slipping away from you it only seems you 've gotten more desperate . 
  he 's not big on the history of the echr , which britain had a defining hand in . 
  we 're not going anywhere , but let 's have a few words together ... 
  took you a day to decide you could n't suffer the pain of loss ? 
  goddamn dude , just move to the distant past already and jerk off . 
  get it out of your system . 
  sweet , party on romanians . 
  as we say in my native tongue - happy europe day !, 
  things you do n't like ! = russophobia . 
  the tory part is down in black and white and loudly proclaiming that they are pro-eu , because we all are . 
  the fact that you do n't * want * this to be the case and are scrambling to * maggie thatcher * for succour is * so embarassing * to watch . 
  when we 're 1/14th of our current size and fill the reddit with topics bitching about other subreddits * then * you 'll be right, 
  i 'm not going to cry about ukip losing seats , but yes , everyone knows the system is inherently broken . 
   `` crimes are committed today in the 21st century amid the aggression against my country ukraine , despite the cruelest lessons of the past , '' poroshenko said in the polish port city of gdansk . 
  i wonder when we 'll finally take this lesson on board . 
  it 's in the interests of the eu - as it always is of all strong bodies - to protect and project it 's power and influence . 
  this goes doubly so when it 's our own doorstep . 
  for some reason we 've let russia dictate that it 's * theirs . 
  * we should 've acted to stamp out that narrative * long * ago . 
   sounds like somebody 's doing some mental gymnastics !, 
  do n't feed the troll . 
  he 's probably off somewhere jacking off right now . 
  the lesson is politicized nationalism is only ever symptomatic of deeper underlying problems . 
  case in point : / r/russia . 
  sounds like * somebody 's * doing some mental gymnastics !, 
  i 'll just leave your last 3 comments here :  [ you okay hun ?

  it 's going to be a very simple map . 
  no they do n't . 
  well considering the only other thread in this topic was started by either an idiot or a troll , let me just say a hearty * a votre sant\u00e9 * to our french posters , and everyone else celebrating today while i 'm stuck in the office . 
  i , uh , i do n't get it ? 
  haha , no you wo n't . 
  i 'm sure they 'll find some 300 pound gorilla who 's able to hide his tattoos long enough for a press photo to take the reigns from big nige . 
  nobody 's prying scotland away from the snp for a long time so this would be a wise direction . 
  well she sounds like a lovely lady . 
  you mean the pool of interchangeable public school toffs has run out ? 
   and yet , the only things the putin-controlled media managed to create these days are russian ripoffs of how i met your mother , big bang theory and the rdj-influenced sherlock series ( which is inferior to vasily ilyanov 's portrayal of sherlock holmes ) . 
  someone tell me these are on youtube . 
  and probably a few other things , too . 
  cyrillic letters are the most depressing script in the goddamn world . 
  i appreciate that you jumped on your alt account to post this ; - *, 
  `` i know everyone constantly said i was a monumental disappointment and that they all hated me , but deep down i honestly believed i was still that plucky guy on the outskirts with so much potential to bring change . '', 
  this is so obviously the correct direction to take i 'm amazed anyone felt the need to report it .
