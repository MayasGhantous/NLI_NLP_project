  * ftfy, 
  oo i was making a joke about the typical * modus operandi * of a drunk with a knife , and how this incident in london does n't fit the description . 
  or ... try to stab a person , fall down , accidentally stab themself , bleed a lot , shout obscenities at would-be samaritans , get rushed to the er for a combination of blood loss/alcohol poisoning . 
  pfft , he probably bopped her on the head and dragged her back to his potato-cave . 
  right ? 
  nothing against your filthy goddamned potato-swindling papist irish antecedent , but he probably had some pretty backwards views with regards to anglicans and the proper way to discipline a scurrilous ho-bag of a baby-factory ( wife ) . 
  but we advanced !, 
  ^ ^ too ^ ^ bad ^ ^ there 's ^ ^ no ^ ^ cure ^ ^ for ^ ^ being ^ ^ a ^ ^ piece-of-shit ^ ^ irishman , ^ ^ though, 
   who we do not usually think of as primitives who were living in the dark ages . 
  do n't we ? 
  my grandfather grew up in a one-room home is glasgow for him and his 8 siblings . 
  his oldest sister got to sleep on the stove because it was the warmest spot in the house . 
  he was always amused-as-hell at things like `` oh , your brother has a * coloured * friend '' or `` hey look , out waitress is a * man * !! '', 
  i like to imagine [ these ] ( https://threadtrend.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/large_003_bum.jpg ) were a major motivating factor in the invention of doggy-style intercourse . 
   b. . . but germany ... stop it . 
  just because someone did something atrocious in the past does n't excuse atrocities committed today . 
   `` hey remember that time you called a girl * fatty-fatty-fat-fat * back in elementary school ? 
  ok yea cool , i 'm gon na stab you in the throat . 
  you ca n't judge me . '', 
  you . 
  that 's your argument . 
  i 'm pretty sure every beach was a nude beach in the dark ages . 
  hm ... something must have stalled in the internal mechanisms . 
  did you try saying `` pikachu snackbar '' ? 
  that might kick-start the ol' murder drive . 
  `` off his meds '' god , lawyers must just * love * that excuse . 
  it seems to work every time . 
  '' * your honour , i move that the defendant be found not-guilty , by reason of mis-managed medication * '' '' * agreed , now get out of here , you little scamp , and try to remember to take your meds next time . 
  it was n't his family , it was another family that was staying at a nearby suite . 
  turns out he was [ `` mentally unstable '' ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ec80ca9bacff41ea922095681f574727/germany-5-wounded-stabbing-train-station ) ... smh, 
  but ... we will bring potato !, 
  captain 's log , stardate 9522.6 : i 've never trusted klingons , and i never will . 
  i could never forgive them for the death of my boy . 
  ( [ source from * le parisien * ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/attentats-terroristes-paris/attentats-de-paris-le-procureur-dement-les-rumeurs-de-tortures-au-bataclan-12-07-2016-5962675.php ) ) at this point , there are still accusations and denials , but no final verdict . 
  and i very deliberately * did n't * call those sources `` mainsteam media '' if you look at my comment closely . 
  however it * is * `` in the media '' . 
  if true , the story will spread . 
  for now the msm has more immediate matters to report on , while the investigation continues . 
   `` no state censorship [ ... ] could keep that sort of info out of mainstream media hands . 
  exactly , and so here it is , in the media . 
  it 's in le parisien , fox news , infowars , etc. 
  i thought the same as you , then i searched `` bataclan torture '' on google . 
  there are older articles with the same content . 
  this is n't actually exclusive to this website . 
  i think maybe this coverage is getting buried by the recent news from the south of france . 
  easy votes . 
  the canadian liberals have a 30 + year track record of letting in migrants , who are subsequently married to that party for life . 
  from a political standpoint , it 's a guaranteed way to keep your job . 
  as for the rest of the country ... `` oh , well ... we 'll see what we can do about that ... '', 
  just like how kindly the ottomans treated the christians at the fall of constantinople , right ? 
  everybody hugged , then ate cupcakes . 
  the meat-tubes : it was an early reconstructive surgery method , called the italian method . 
  they would cut a strip of healthy skin from another part of the body , and leave part still attached for circulation . 
  then they would sew it to the disfigured/missing section of the body , and leave it for a period of time . 
  eventually new blood vessels would form connecting the tissue to the disfigured portion of the face . 
  then the surgeons would sever the tissue from the original site , and the patient would have something resembling a normal nose/chin . 
  here 's [ an interesting article ] ( https://thechirurgeonsapprentice.com/2013/09/04/renaissance-rhinoplasty-the-16th-century-nose-job/ ) on the subject . 
  see ( do n't freak out on me ) we 're now inviting in millions of outsiders who do n't believe in those common rules you mentioned . 
  this will have a de-stabilizing effect . 
  we can blame ourselves all we want , but that wo n't change the fact that we 've opened the door for people who do n't give a damn about freedom of expression and equal rights for all . 
  maybe so that - once abandoned - they do n't fill with water and become breeding grounds for mosquitoes ? 
  rape , forced incestuous relationships , domestic violence including rape , being drugged in a nightclub , i could go on . 
  but fuck you for trying to diminish the suffering of others because it does n't comform to your rosy world view . 
  bless you , poland . 
  european salvation will come from within your borders . 
  i will never again make a joke about polish submariners . 
  anecdotally , i can say ( coming from canada ) that every.single.woman i know - who is willing to speak to me as a confidant - has attested to being a victim of sexual violence at some point in their life . 
  and i 'm from goddamned canada , where we 're supposedly better than all that bullshit . 
  ... or capital punishment, 
  fun fact : i 'm not american . 
  i just really appreciate that they had the balls to elect a leader who wo n't sell his country to foreign interests . 
  and i hope you 're right . 
  i firmly believe that europe would win , in a holy war against islam . 
  but i also do n't want it to happen , because the casualties would be catastrophic on all sides . 
  ( except china , who would swan in at the last minute , once all sides were thoroughly depleted . ), 
  i 'm pretty sure at least * some * of the 20,000,000 greek diaspora would n't mind returning to their ancestral lands . 
  gl with the holy wars your country wants to wage :d, 
  because you 're convinced that you are superior , and your urge for confirmation bias drew you dangerously close to the truth . 
  problem is ... you ca n't handle the truth . 
  ... and * i 'm * mad that the mods count turkey as europe . 
  perhaps we can take up our argument on the field of honour , un-blunted larp swords and all !, 
  in what way would the hypothetical reclamation of constantinople be any different ? 
  go back to my posts on this thread . 
  i do n't recall ever espousing killings or deportations . 
   buying a russian missile defense system a system for which the russians almost assuredly possess override codes for . 
  erdogan is russia 's useful idiot . 
  and when erdogan 's usefulness runs out ... 
  that 's a pretty soft definition of genocide , chum . 
  is the annexation of crimea genocide ? 
  nope was france retaking alsace/lorraine genocide ? 
  nope was the reconquesta genocide ? 
  yea ... kinda , but not moreso than the initial moorish invasion . 
  i would be ok with this outcome, 
  no one * is pushing genocide , as such . 
  but we will firmly stand by the opinion that turkey 's '' '' '' `` population exchange '' '' '' '' was a bad idea , and that a lot of good people lost what rightfully belonged to them . 
  to borrow a phrase from the other side of the continent . 
  * we can still rise now , and be the nation again * * ok yes , some people are probably talking about actual genocide , and that 's not cool . 
  red hats . 
  we have the very best hats over here .
