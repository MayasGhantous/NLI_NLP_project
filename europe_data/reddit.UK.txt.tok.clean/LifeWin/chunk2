  those bad dudes wish they had hats as awesome as we do . 
  do n't we have the best red hats , folks ? 
  i 'll tell you what , the british know who has the best hats . 
  13.1 % of the dutch know whose hats are best !, 
  you 're right . 
  i should be helping . 
  we ca n't let that happen . 
  and besides , belgium does n't need our help , they 've got [ jkvd ] ( http://home.earthlink.net/~kczvandammepage/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/king_of_the_jungle.jpg ) ( nsfh ^ * ) * not safe for your heterosexuality, 
  heyyyy ... we have hats , too !, 
  ( also , my intravenous feed of redbull has made it metabolically impossible for me to be overweight ), 
  c'mon greece ... they 're your roomates . 
  why is germany getting the letter-bombs here ? 
  putin is just itching for a reason to swoop in and re-take constantinople . 
  c'mon erdogan , give him a chance . 
  i 'll make popcorn . 
  it 's delicious , and i will go full-on wolverine on your ass if you pull that shit on our side of the atlantic . 
  take your sauerkraut pizza and begone !, 
  because sweden is a lot smaller in the 1000 ad map , than it is on most 2017 ad maps . 
  ( i dare you to say 2017 ce ... ), 
  no , mohammed , you may not explode my goat !, 
  silly reindeer , who let you use the computer ? 
  soon ... 
  that footstool 's name ? 
  suleiman the adequate, 
  no one asked you , pythagoras . 
  go back to your circles while philip of macedon civilizes those funny-islanders to the south . 
  ( i 'll give you an upvote if you can resist the urge to correct the glaring historical inaccuracies in my poorly-executed banter ), 
  have you ever tried using a footstool when your lymph nodes are self-destructing ? 
  come back after you have , or check your privilege !, 
  the important one . 
  with the sparkles , and kevin sorbo . 
  i 'm pretty sure that was a thing . 
  it 's possible i 've got my wires crossed . 
  but have you considered that statements of opinion from anonymous redditors just ** may ** be more accurate than your '' '' `` textbooks '' '' '' and '' '' `` historians '' '' '' ?!? 
  did n't think so . 
  ... not at all . 
  the ottomans ( muslims ) butchered the christian byzantines . 
  are we forgetting that the masses fleeing the ottomans brough the black death with them to the rest of europe ? 
  ... from the swede who would probably be a norwegian or dane , 1000 years ago . 
  so the fact that the greeks are nearly completely absent from western anatolia ... 
  perhaps , but i do know that turkey has been ( by varying degrees ) less than welcoming to christians ( i.e. 
  armenians and greeks ) , so it would n't surprise me at all if a similar exodus/purge took place , with their jewish population . 
  while i believe you why are their numbers higher pre-war ? 
  sooo ... turkey , huh ? 
  imagine hitler and the bubonic plague had sex , then gave birth to plaguestalin and david icke , then those two had inbred cancer-babies !, 
  who * does n't * like being gently rocked to sleep ? 
  i would be ok with that, 
  jacobite here , i can has crown now ? 
   hands off approach ... too soon , man, 
  i do n't do this terrible often , compared to my average sassy one - or two-liners . 
  but every now and again i 'm motivated to create something a bit more . 
  if you check out my comment history , and sort by ` best ' you might find some other stuff that will amuse you . 
  i 'm ok with that, 
  as long as each story ends in `` and then the [ western nation 's ] special services dead-ed them . '', 
  i 'm especially proud of this , tbh, 
  well ... the french have always had a dark sense of humour . 
  i hope they give their quarry a solid ass-grab before the execution . 
  ** [ scene : nighttime at a quiet wadi somewhere in the middle east ] ** ** terrorist # 1 ** : `` hey mohammed , it 's night 's like these , when the moon reflects off the sand , and the breeze comes in from the west , that you really start to think about life . '', 
  ** terrorist # 2 ** : `` i know what you mean , mohamed . 
  just the other day i saw my reflection in the eyes of a crying infidel woman , right before i beheaded her , and i thought to myself , yes , mohammed , truly i am doing god 's work . '', 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ * honhonhonhonhonhonhon * ** t1 ** : `` did you hear something ? '', 
  ** t2 ** : `` what ? 
  when i close my eyes , i only hear the sweet sound of my brothers shrieking * halalalalalalalalalalaaaaaa !!, 
  * when we ride into glorious battle on the back of a flatbed toyota hilux . '', 
  ** t1 ** : `` ah ... it was probably nothing ... '' ^ ^ * honhonhonhonhon * ** t1 ** : `` there it was again ! '', 
  real talk , bruh . 
  you 're not getting that fruity ptsd the infidels are always complaining about are you ? '', 
  ** t1 ** : `` sh -- shut up !, 
  you 're the fruit . 
  i saw you making eye-contact with that goat the other day . 
  [ you hesitated when you killed him afterwards ] ( http://quranx.com/hadith/abudawud/usc-msa/book-38/hadith-4449/ ) . 
  you totally wanted to keep him . '', 
  *** honhonhonhon *** ** t2 ** : `` ok i totally heard it too . '', 
  [ grabs ass , shoots terrorists in face , skulls explode ] ** [ end scene ] **, 
  i dunno ... i often hunt down my wife in epic games of grab-ass that only i know are happening . 
  ... until it 's too late, 
   france is ` hunting down its citizens who joined isis ' without trial in iraq ... and killing them . 
  right ? 
  like , they 're not just hunting them down , then slapping them on the butt and saying `` you 're it '' , right ? 
  i know . 
  the disconnect so many people seem to feel is that it 's very possible to want the best for everybody , while not simultaneously letting them into your home . 
  i do n't want people to be homeless , so i donate to charity . 
  i will not let them sleep in my kid 's room . 
  i do not want muslims to suffer , so i oppose isis ( who ** are ** killing a lot of muslims , along with anyone else they can find ) . 
  i will not suggest the world open up it 's borders , though . 
   subtract the women , the children and the elderly from that 1.5 % [ soo ... 1.4 % ] ( http://static.deia.com/images/2016/03/14/efe_20160314_141428_pa11271refugiadosgrande_9983_11.jpg ), 
   is it just me , or ~ ~ moroccans/moroccan descendants ~ ~ are ** muslims ** a bit over-represented in terror related incidents in europe ? 
  ftfy, 
  i kinda wonder what the sentiment is over in the various - stans . 
  surely kyrgyzstan is n't experiencing a renaissance , under *** their *** new leadership . 
  [ yes ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/11/video-undefined-20748a1d00000578-379_636x358.jpg ), 
  is ... is that assaad sitting in the spanish king 's desk ? 
  just getting ' tea-bagged by caesar 24-7 , but other than that ... 
  b-but dragostea din tei ? 
  surely that song alone is enough to ... ... no i 'm sorry that joke is a failure . 
  i 'm sorry that moldova is having such a rough go . 
  i honestly feel that russia 's break-up has caused a lot of problems . 
  the countries in between main russia and kaliningrad seem very happy to be free . 
  many of the other states seem no better off ( from the comfort of my baby-seal-skin igloo ), 
  i 'll be honest , i thought romania spent some time in the ussr , and i was wrong , so i was really reaching for a filler regime that was also not-so-good .
