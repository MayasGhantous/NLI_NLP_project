the swiss air force currently only operates during office hours . 
  if a hostile air attack were to occur outside the normal working day , switzerland would be utterly helpless to respond . 
  i am not making this up . 
   in what world does it take one month to get to `` eastern europe '' ? 
  one in which any large fighting force depends upon a complex network of supply lines being set up . 
  the bbc thinks otherwise , see [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28770519 ) , for example :  france has received approval from authorities in baghdad for the decision, 
  from wikipedia :  shell topped the 2013 fortune global 500 list of the world 's largest companies . 
  royal dutch shell revenue was equal to 84 % of the netherlands 's $ 555.8 billion gdp at the time . 
  using shell 's 2013 figure for revenue ( $ 451bn ) , according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal % 29 ) list , if it were a country it would have the 27th largest economy in the world , surpassing countries such as austria , south africa , greece or portugal . 
  the eu does not include a mutual defense treaty - simply being a member of the eu provides absolutely nothing in the way of any kind of wmd-backed deterrence . 
  on its own , europe has a frankly laughable capacity to project hard power or use it to influence other states on the world stage . 
  for crying out loud , we 're utterly , utterly powerless to prevent a state on our borders from getting torn apart by russia because it wanted closer ties with us . 
  - deterioration of trade relations between the two nations . 
  - more aggressive policy from russia to preserve what it perceives as its exclusive sphere of influence and counter what it sees as actively hostile behaviour from nato , similar to what we are currently seeing in ukraine . 
  i think there was some less-than-serious speculation about it in the less-than-serious media . 
  prince charles is still the heir apparent , and he 's not going to give that up . 
  unfortunately that 's not the way it works . 
  it 's far more effective for a party to work to appeal to swing * voters * rather than apathetic non-voters . 
  there is no way to distinguish between your relatively informed non-voting , and someone who does n't vote because they did n't know/care it was election day . 
   no party really speaks to me currently do you think not bothering to vote is an effective way to make parties work to try and `` speak to you '' ? 
   something tells me their definition of `` human rights '' somewhat differs from ours . 
  yes . 
  the right to sanctity of religion is valued above the right to freedom of speech . 
  it 's why certain people in countries such as afghanistan get angry at * the usa itself * when people * from * the usa start burning the quran - they ca n't understand why the us is n't arresting these people for blasphemy . 
  well , the polish-lithuanian commonwealth used to be [ pretty big ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:polish-lithuanian_commonwealth_ ( orthographic_projection % 29 . svg ) . 
  as i recall , most of the anger in that thread was directed at the idea that nato was somehow the bad guy for intervening . 
  i mean , the whole thing * started * because the dude was complaining about the bridges being bombed . 
  with a title like `` 15 years since nato bombed the bridges * for some reason * '' you 're not exactly inviting enlightened debate . 
   you 're not really capable of having a discussion , are you ? 
  not with you , no . 
   yes , there was ethnic cleansing in kosovo , but there was no genocide . 
  oh , well that 's alright then . 
  you commit genocide in [ croatia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia%e2%80%93serbia_genocide_case ) , you commit genocide in [ bosnia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_genocide ) , and you start doing the same in albania by committing [ this massacre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suva_reka_massacre ) , [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ra%c4%8dak_massacre ) , [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podujevo_massacre ) , [ this massacre here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_at_velika_kru%c5%a1a ) , [ this massacre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/izbica_massacre ) , [ this other massacre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drenica_massacre ) , [ this massacre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gornje_obrinje_massacre ) , [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuska_massacre ) , [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bela_crkva_massacre ) , [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%86u%c5%a1ka ) and [ others ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_horseshoe ) , along with a whole range of [ other war crimes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_in_the_kosovo_war ) , but now we 're supposed to feel bad because we * did n't let you finish the job * ? 
  you sick , sad , pathetic excuse for a human being . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  it 's logistics and what 's that other thing , prevention ? 
  that 's how the west sees it , right ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
   novi sad is about 500 kilometers away from pristina , so there must be a flow of goods coming from that city yes . 
   let 's destroy the bridges makes sense . 
   and refineries seems reasonable . 
  enemy vehicles need fuel , right ? 
   and radio television novi sad well , communications are important in war . 
   and everything that gets in the way !, 
  exactly , yes . 
  stop at nothing to end a brutal genocide , and send a clear message that this shit will not go unpunished . 
   i ca n't be finnish because my blood is n't finnish the error in your logic is here . 
  europe experimented with ethnic nationalism in the 19th and 20th centuries , and it did n't go down very well . 
  right now , you `` ca n't '' be finnish not because your `` blood '' is n't finnish , but because you spent your childhood growing up in another country . 
  that country was the usa , not italy . 
  your cultural frame of reference is the usa , not italy . 
  your language comes from the usa , not italy . 
  your customs come from the usa , not italy . 
  if you were to spend a few decades living in finland , immersed in its culture , learning its customs , gradually picking up every little nuance of the language and finnish identity , * then * you could call yourself finnish . 
  blood has nothing to do with it . 
  it 's actually rather unfortunate that one of the first american customs you 're going to have to get over is this concept of ethnic national identity itself . 
  you think you ca n't be finnish because your great grandparents ( or whoever , its rather irrelevant ) lived in italy , thus giving you `` italian blood '' . 
  this is not a biological obstacle to becoming finnish , but it is a cultural one . 
  the problem is not your blood but your concept of what makes someone a particular nationality . 
  sure , that might work . 
  it 's not a system that is used anywhere ( yet ... !, 
  ) , though . 
  uh , can we ? 
  the british monarchy seems to do reasonably well ... 
  exactly . 
  oh , i 'm definitely arguing for the existing limited monarchies . 
  absolute monarchies with absolute power only really made sense hundreds of years ago when countries had largely illiterate populations that were n't able to make informed democratic decisions . 
  i think that the more people are able to properly engage with issues and make informed choices about them , the more democratic a society ought to be . 
  on the king 's speech , you 'll note that george vi was n't really properly groomed to be king . 
  he was n't the heir , his brother edward viii was - the abdication crisis was rather unprecedented , and nobody had really envisaged the possibility of `` bertie '' becoming king . 
  hence edward with his years of preparation appeared charismatic and at-ease in the corridors of power , whereas george , ascending to the throne rather suddenly , did not . 
  now , if you ca n't `` realistically argue '' that the type of limited , figurehead-style monarchies we see today are harmful , i 'm a little confused why you want to donate money trying to abolish them ? 
  again , nice sounding idea , not necessarily good in practice . 
  you say yourself that that is n't usually the way it works - if the vast majority of electoral candidates are those born into a more limited privilege * anyway * , then you do not lose much by slightly formalising this process to ensure a much greater level of preparedness on the part of the person in question . 
  remember that all hereditary positions are very limited in power and exist rather like a cross between a figurehead and a check on elected power that is immune to populism - the real political power remains democratic . 
  i see your flag is a european flag . 
  you , a european : - organised the holocaust - organised ethnic cleansing in bosnia - committed awful , awful things in the belgian congo see , i can generalise a person based on nothing more than a flag too !, 
  my point is that a ruling class has the potential to be more effective if it is hereditary , at least in part . 
  with a hereditary ruling class , a person may devote their entire lifetime training and preparing for eventual rule , and that is simply not possible in any other system . 
   i like to think that all people are born equal . 
  obviously all people are not equal exactly . 
  people are n't born equal . 
  being born into wealth is a huge advantage . 
  heck , being born into a good * reputation * is an advantage . 
  i do n't see either of these two advantages being eliminated any time soon . 
   and it is funny we are discussing this , because last night i was discussing with my wife how we need to amend the us constitution to change the bit that says the president must be born in the united states . 
  that provision is needlessly exclusionary ( though it probably made sense in 1789 ) . 
  agreed . 
   to be born into a legally subordinate position ( i.e. 
  commoner ) , because there exists a legally entitled class , the head of which is head of state ( and even head of the church ) eviscerates the very thought of equality amongst human beings . 
  if ( and i really do mean if ) a more effective system of government were achievable by having a very small class of person who was born and trained from birth to govern , would you still object to the existence of that class ? 
  speaking for myself , i have no problem with the existence of a ruling class , provided they are not needlessly above the law ( and that their power is properly limited , rather like the system in my own country ) . 
  this spanish princess ought to be rightly put on trial just as anyone else would be , * but that does not necessarily mean royalty ought not to exist * . 
   it is an offense to human dignity , that people should be born into a legally superior status by dint of birth . 
  why 's that , then ? 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  what i said might not be completely correct , now you mention it . 
  it 's just that , as a native speaker , `` how x are called '' sounds rather jarring whereas `` what x are called '' and `` how x are named '' both sound ( more ) correct . 
  i would * guess * that it 's something to do with the fact that something can be * named * ( `` on thursday , the new country was named '' ) , but has to be * called * something specific ( `` the new country will now be called ` limes19land ' '' ) . 
  could someone with a better understanding of grammar weigh in ?
