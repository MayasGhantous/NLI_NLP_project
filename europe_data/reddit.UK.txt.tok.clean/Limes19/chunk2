  sorry i ca n't be of more help . 
  i tend to find that people whose education has included more of an emphasis on foreign languages tend to be better at grammar . 
  alternatively , `` how different countries are named '' . 
  also correct . 
   by that logic if gbp was considered a commodity like gold in norway and not as a currency then it too would not be a currency in norway . 
  correct . 
  no , it being called a currency by a magazine does not define it as a currency . 
  like i said , if it 's not being taxed as a currency in norway , it is n't a currency in norway . 
  now , now , do n't misquote ( emphasis mine ) :  a currency ... in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form ** when in actual use or circulation ** , as a medium of exchange , especially circulating paper money . 
   a ** much more general use ** of the word currency is anything that is used in any circumstances , as a medium of exchange . 
  if bitcoin is n't recognised as currency by norway , then in norway * it is n't currency * . 
  it 's got a specific legal definition , and is subject to different taxation as a result . 
  in this case , it 's an * asset * , so capital gains tax can be charged . 
  your opinion on whether it is or is n't currency is not going to matter to the tax collector . 
  no , i 'm not twisting your words . 
  you 're twisting your own words , because you 're misunderstanding what a currency is . 
  you can barter with currency , but that does n't mean everything that is bartered with qualifies . 
   no , but people still exchange it hence it 's a currency . 
  people exchange pokemon cards , but that does n't mean i can use them to pay my rent . 
   eu issue-naming crisis, 
  germany abolished conscription a few years ago , did n't it ? 
  i did n't count anything , i repeated the assertions in the report . 
  all i 'm doing here is making the case that the usa was not the most-terroristy country in the world in 2001 . 
  i do n't think school shooters should be classed as terrorists , though . 
  ut\u00f8ya was very much the work of a man trying to better a political ideology . 
  an insane man and an insane ideology , yes , but he was pretty clear that that was what he thought he was doing . 
  school shootings , on the other hand , tend not to be done to make political statements as far as i 'm aware . 
  i highly doubt it . 
  i 'm at work at the moment so i do n't really have time to read it , but [ this ] ( http://economicsandpeace.org/research/iep-indices-data/global-terrorism-index ) might be useful to you . 
  some choice points : - only 31 of the 158 countries ranked have not experienced a terrorist attack since 2001 ; - north america is the least likely region to suffer from terrorism ; - western europeans are nineteen times more likely to be killed in a terrorist attack than north americans ;, 
  i know the difference between the two , thank you . 
  however , aragon the modern autonomous community is not the same as the historical crown of aragon - the latter was a [ personal union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/personal_union ) between the kingdom of aragon and the county of barcelona ( itself an evolution of the [ principality of catalonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_catalonia ) ) . 
  catalonia was therefore not simply some province in a larger aragonese state , and you should n't dismiss it as such . 
  think of it as more of a member of a confederation of separate , well-defined states . 
  [ really ? 
  never ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_aragon ), 
  tell me , what do you regard as an acceptable false conviction rate in death penalty cases ? 
  yes , you are downvoting based upon nationality . 
  and who are you to decide whose opinions are or are not wanted ? 
  just because this sub is for discussions * about * europe , does not make it exclusively for europeans to do the discussing . 
  why do you think a us flag exists in the flair choices in the first place ? 
  they do * seem * much pissier than you do ... 
  actually i have n't really seen that in this thread . 
  most americans seem to have been saying words to the effect of `` i 'm personally not like that . 
  please do n't judge based on nationality '' . 
  `` they '' ? 
  could it be possible that some people are xenophobic idiots , and some are normal , well adjusted people ? 
  which category do you think people who make assumptions about someone based on their nationality fit into ? 
  the problem is not specifically `` they can dish it out but ca n't take it '' , but that it occurs at all . 
  so stop perpetuating it , please . 
  why ? 
  do you think the idea of an american downvoting europeans because they are european would make you angry ? 
  no idea why you were on 0 points when i saw your post , because you 're entirely correct ... 
  you 've browsed a cherry-picked selection of things people have found that are especially moronic , and are basing your view of `` what americans think/know of europe '' upon * that * ? 
  you 're being just as ignorant and narrow minded as the people you hate !, 
  there is , however , a lot of `` soul searching '' in the press about britain 's role in the world . 
  that `` small island '' jibe that some russian diplomat made seems to have personally insulted several commentators . 
  for the love of god man , de gaulle !, 
  how much do you estimate it would cost to send the entire workforce on training courses to learn this ? 
  if someone who uses the software by choice claims the ui is tricky , what do you think your typical mindless office drone will make of it ? 
  it 's hardly like the people there have just arrived . 
  should spain hand back catalonia to the crown of aragon ? 
  or the grenada area to the moors ? 
  the timescale is roughly similar ... why should gibraltar be spanish rather than moorish ? 
  a - there are only a very few select regions of vague importance to europe - flanders , for example , has a strong independence movement . 
  not every european region has its own flag here . 
  b - 99 % of the people viewing them wo n't have a clue what the flag is supposed to represent just by looking at it ... would you have a clue what you are looking at if i were to have an english county flag , or a flag of a specific french department , or a german state ? 
  i think i could just about identify the flags of california and texas , but that 's it . 
  c - also , if we 're opening it out to individual regions of non-euro countries , why should we restrict ourselves to the us ? 
  if we 're adding regions to the us options ( and presumably fleshing out the eu options too ) that 's already hundreds of new flags before we even consider other countries . 
  d - nobody here particularly cares about american `` regional variation '' . 
  you have the same language and ( roughly speaking ) the same history . 
  i do n't particularly want to start a debate about this so we 'll have to agree to disagree , but i imagine a lot of subscribers here would agree with my view on this . 
  tl ; dr - no , do n't be ridiculous . 
  i know it 's unclear who `` first '' set foot on the island , but it * is * clear that in 1690 captain john strong of the * welfare * reached the islands . 
  meaning the british have had an association with the islands since 1690 at the latest . 
  furthermore , the notion that the french may possibly have got there first does n't really change matters . 
  the islanders have the right to self determination , and the british government supports that right . 
  time and again , the islanders have demonstrated their decision to be considered british . 
  if you undermine their right to self determination , it becomes rather difficult in turn to justify the argentine right to self determination in the face of the spanish empire ... 
  erm , this history supports the fact that an englishman first arrived at the islands in 1690 ... did you read the link you posted ? 
  does it matter whether it 's originally european or american or whatever ? 
  does it matter that it 's ( apparently , i see very little evidence of this ) influenced by `` non-european '' culture ? 
  or the quorn products available for vegetarians ... 
  - what if they do n't want to be liberated ? 
  - who is doing this `` oppression and control '' , what form exactly does it take ? 
  - are n't you just redefining what `` communism '' means because you do n't want to be associated with previous attempts to implement what you believe in ? 
  well i suggest that in future you make your points more clearly . 
  i was trying to draw you out on what i interpreted as a racist and xenophobic commentary on european multiculturalism . 
  i did read the links , but , again , misunderstood what you were trying to say by posting them . 
  apologies for the misunderstanding . 
  for the record i reckon the reality is somewhere between what you and that other guy were saying . 
  to imply americans are `` wallowing in ignorance '' is clearly an absurdly sweeping statement , but so is implying that europeans `` look down '' on muslims/turks/whoever . 
  yes , there are extremely vocal minorities that advocate and exhibit evidence for both points , but they are not representative of the whole . 
  he says that americans are unwilling to understand other cultures . 
  you respond by implying muslims and turks are the people who are causing problems in europe . 
  you 're not making much sense . 
  i 'm not suggesting the us is evil , far from it in fact . 
  i was n't a part of the discussion above these comments at all .
