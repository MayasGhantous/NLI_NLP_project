  corbyn is one , no ? 
  ** if ** he gets a successful retirement, 
  touche, 
  unless someone argues that stovl is lame and catobar is better . 
  i mean , you do n't have the money that actually goes to the end products . 
  the questions like `` how many armata tanks will be built '' will give interesting answers . 
  not to mention , those money are not just for developing and building new stuff . 
  they are maintenance ( which will also partially disappear ), 
  just like in the us election . 
  people are smarter this time, 
  they do n't have the money, 
  my theory is that losers love the company of losers . 
  as for the french right wing specifically , these people are old-timers who still think that russia is still a credible counter-weight . 
  at the same time , they have a difficult time comprehending on why china is more credible , due to cultural/racial/historical reasons . 
   he wants a strong and more integrated eu/ez nope . 
  he wants a `` eurozone government '' made up of the governments of the euro currency members . 
  he 's denying the eu some power . 
  deleted . 
  the biggest steaming pile of post-modern shit that came out of the west 's ass . 
  what is the french public 's opinion of russia ? 
  i ca n't decide which one is worse , but my friend did a compelling argument : trump is 4-8 years only , but brexit is permanent . 
  france has been acting on its own accord throughout the cold war and even today with their francafrique . 
  they 've been meddling and puppeting post-colonial african states as if they still own them . 
  i would rate the uk , france , and russia on the same league . 
  us and china are on their own at the top . 
  greenies are n't exactly the most intelligent people out there . 
  have you ever talked to hipsters and environmentalists in your life ? 
  exactly . 
  and where are you gon na get the money ? 
  their judgements are premature as well , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  and you believed them . 
  the media makes a profit by confirming their target audience 's bias and prejudices . 
  this is why i do n't even read papers that are aligned to my views . 
  the betting firms profit by trying to keep the odds accurate as possible to maximise revenue . 
  they still lost on this one , of course . 
  the most pessimistic odds i 've seen on trump is 20-25 % during the last days of the election . 
  i did n't check the betting odds for brexit . 
  the only ones i know that gave that kind of odds are the pundit papers themselves like huffpo 's 99 % clinton win . 
  if you 're reading huffpo , then you 're living in a democrat echo chamber . 
  i rarely bet . 
  but the betting market gives a clearer picture than pundits . 
  that 's good news , but journos are just utterly stupid . 
  ca n't they wait until brexit negotiations have actually concluded ? 
  like what ? 
  the uk would ally china against the us ? 
  you missed his point , mate . 
  being pro-eu is also banned in the socialism subreddit . 
  what does the betting market says ? 
  you already have nord stream 1 , no ? 
  wow . 
  an article that 's neither `` rule britannia '' nor `` doom britannia '' , but a very nuanced article . 
  i 'm surprised , r/europe !, 
  personally , i care about # 3 primarily - the fall of living standards concerns me . 
  at least , the job market is n't bad . 
  i think the pound and the economy would remain lacklustre until the deal is sealed . 
  a deal would mean certainty for businesses , and allows them to make big decisions . 
   it does n't matter what the british do with johnson , because the eu is n't going to agree to any brexit deal with the uk no matter what , because it 's politically impossible for brussels to sign anything that limits the eu 's authority in european geopolitics . 
  wtf ? 
  how so ? 
  deal or no deal , the uk will be friendlier than it is to the eu , because of geopolitics . 
  the eu ca n't really think for itself foreign-policy-wise until it gets that power . 
  tip ( just the tip ) : use imf or wb for figures . 
  also , gdp nominal is better than gdp ppp . 
  ppp distorts it in a way that it makes countries like india and russia to be larger than they should be . 
  yep . 
  that 's how politics 101 works . 
  it 's not about the interests of the country , it 's the interests of the people in charge to keep themselves in power . 
  that 's true . 
  this sub is pretty much an unapologetic circlejerk . 
  at least , r/yurop is fun . 
  yeah . 
  but nationalist sentiments are always romantic . 
  the knife edge scottish independence ref and brexit show us that . 
  two-speed definitely fits britain 's circumstances . 
  it 's still a member , but without obstructing integration - which is needed for the eurozone . 
  let the `` inner eu '' integrate themselves . 
  sure , we are n't part of the inner circle , but it 's obvious that the public does n't want that . 
  the only problem here are the egghead morons among our elites and the plebs wanting to be part of that inner circle because ** britain ** , without the icky stuff like the single currency or integrated defence . 
  you need a good access into the inner circle of the eu to get this . 
  i 'm putting doubts on this , until the eu did show signs of them willing to compromise . 
  i would say 2025 or later for montenegro . 
  the eu have set a freeze on new members until that year . 
  serbia could join with montenegro if they make it . 
  if not , then it 's possible within a few years after montenegro 's membership . 
  that 's , like , your opinion . 
  but really , yes ; it is . 
  the eu have set a accession freeze until 2025 . 
  i think that 's reasonable , especially in this modern world where things go pretty fast . 
  a decade ( or 8 years to be exact ) is a very long time . 
  multiple decades is too pessimistic . 
  i would probably disagree . 
  serbia 's actions are so in opposite to its political rhetoric . 
  they `` like '' russia , they said . 
  kosovo is ours , they said . 
  yet , they are speeding towards the eu opening and closing chapters . 
  they have met with the kosovars where kosovo is pretty much independent but not technically independent . 
  the rhetoric that is delivered to the serbian public is opposite of serbia 's foreign policy . 
  why ? 
  because politicians want the people to vote for them , and foreign partners to make them rich . 
  you forgot the elephant in the room : crimea .
