  so alde candidate will lose each time until the voters get the message and stop voting for them . 
  in fptp only , then yes . 
  uk lib-dems are often the 3rd party . 
  fuck no . 
  electoral college only cements the 2 party system . 
  do you really just want the european people 's party and the party of european socialist as your choice ? 
  i doubt it . 
  neither does it protects small states . 
  if you look at the stats on previous elections , presidential candidates were n't focused on the little states . 
  in fact , the electoral college only benefits the swing states . 
  it 'll be more than a pain in the ass . 
  much needed reform of the eu would be difficult with her as the president . 
  more like `` ka n't be wrong '' amarite ? 
  anti-eu left asserts that the eu is a mere extension of american power and it is a neo-liberal experiment . 
   putin and his cronies will suck every resource which will destroy russia, 
   the us slaps heavy tariffs on eurozone companies because of currency manipulation and grant uk based companies free access to us market i hope you know how wto rules work . 
  i have a bad feeling you do n't . 
  imperial rome was n't like absolute monarchies of europe where dynasties lasted pretty long . 
  if the king died , ** boom ** long live the king !, 
  at least , that 's some degree of stability . 
  this is over-simplification though . 
  imperial rome can be considered a military dictatorship after the julio-claudians . 
  the emperor is the head of the military , and when the emperor died , every ambitious general with a legion claims it . 
  the romans have no proper succession laws because they are so paranoid about kings , even tho the emperor is a king in all but name . 
  edit : also if you average out the civil wars in all of the empire 's history , there 's one in each decade . 
  haha good luck trying to cut off trade between 2 of the 3 largest economies in the world and * get away with it * . 
  i do n't know why this is still a thing . 
  the eaeu exists , but they just put border checks on one another at arbitrary time for arbitrary reasons . 
  blame the greeks, 
  we have a winner, 
  he is not a dictator ; he is just [ `` first citizen '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augustus ), 
  the problem with this is that the eu as an institution * does not * have the means to act like a traditional country with serious hard power . 
  keep in mind that countries like britain and france are not shy on invading countries . 
  if your only tool is a glove ... 
  anyway , i remember years ago i 'm arguing with a french blogger ( who is very well informed btw ) on eu politics and geopolitics . 
  he believes that hard power is not required any more and soft power is what matters . 
  i wonder how he is doing now . 
  if the elites think like him , then this continent is fucking doomed . 
  but thankfully , that does n't seem to be the case . 
  if anything , as the chinese are becoming wealthier , the more they grumble - and that 's what 's happening now . 
  corruption was a serious issue among the chinese that xi and the communist party took it seriously ( but only to some extent ) . 
  sure , they wo n't upend the system because they are still benefiting from it . 
  but like any country , china will slow down on its growth and will experience recessions once chinese economy becomes developed ( as massive as it is today , china is still a `` newly industrialised country '' ) . 
  however , the most likely outcome for me is not revolution , but gradually small reforms that is designed to keep the communist party in power . 
  korea and taiwan started off as dictatorships . 
  democratic japan , through the cold war , was monopolised by the ldp . 
  singapore is still monopolised by the pap . 
  there are ways of doing this ; the usa and singapore are good examples of how repressive their democratic system is - fptp , electoral college , gerrymandering , etc. 
  block voting and party loyalty are good tactics employed within democratic but developing countries . 
  however , i wo n't see china democratising itself now or later . 
  china still has a whooping 6.8 % gdp growth today . 
  he is an old school leftist who is still stuck in the 70s . 
  people will always argue about thatcher 's reforms , but most older people do n't want to return back in the days of the `` winter of discontent '' . 
  some people call it `` elected dictatorship '' . 
  the only counter-balance here is : if a legislation contradicts the echr , a judge may conclude that it is against echr and make that section of the law ineffective - then following judges will do the same because of precedence . 
  but do n't worry , once may repeal the legislation that enforces echr , then our sovereignty will be complete !!, 
  the usa is just one level above everyone on every field . 
  but eu soft power is real and should n't be underestimated . 
  this is the bloc that made eastern european countries reform themselves by themselves . 
  no eu troops on the ground needed . 
  no `` state-building '' occupation needed . 
  hell , ukraine overthrew a president because he 180 'd on the eu association agreement . 
  i really ca n't find a counter example for the americans on this one . 
  ca n't do that with their russian exceptionalism, 
  not really . 
  uzbekistan already left csto back in 2012 . 
  uzbekistan and turkmenistan are pretty independent in international affairs . 
  they are the only 2 former central asian ssrs who did n't join the eurasian economic union . 
   i know everyone has been speaking against cherry picking but there may be a chance of negotiating some kind of immigration cap , i do n't mean to sound like an exceptionalist but the single market is stronger with us inside it and the eu knows that , the four freedoms could be twisted in a brussels back room . 
  again , that 's a tough sell to the eu countries . 
  even with a thin veneer of control like we impose some points-based immigration and eu citizens get an automatic 9,001 points sounds difficult . 
  they have little political incentive on doing this ; on the flip side , they have political incentives to punish us . 
  telling them that we have a yuuuuge economy does n't cut it politically . 
  the huge bribe the eu needs is political , not economic . 
  sounds like a good option !, 
  but what 's worrying are the brexit radicals who wants to get out of the single market because of the freedom of movement and ecj remaining as a higher court on eu legislations . 
  i wo n't call it a superpower until the eu has the institutional means to act like one . 
  if you push the argument far enough , you can consider the eu as a superpower when it comes to soft power only . 
  but relying on soft power alone just does n't cut it . 
  that 's because the us was the only country that has decent economy back then . 
  everyone else got whacked by ww2 . 
  unsurprisingly , [ the new deal ideology starts to crumble ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/ ) , especially with europe and east asia gradually recovers a few decades later . 
  maybe you , too , also shows your ignorance of history . 
  fair enough . 
   just to answer the last part of your post , i really do n't think joining a regional organisation has to be as politically charged as you 're making it look . 
  the fact that a leftist presidential candidate wants to join a left-wing latin american organisation is as political as you can get . 
  i was suppose to say 5 but i forgot ecuador . 
  also i did n't know that some caribbean countries are included , but then how does that help the other side 's point ? 
  alba is a very small group , regardless . 
  your point keeps changing at every post . 
  lol why ? 
  you know that there are lots of other latin american organisations out there that are ** far more inclusive ** than alba , right ? 
  each with their own purpose and scope . 
  the laia and the iberian-american summit aregood examples . 
  alba only has ** four ** members . 
  i am raising the point about venezuela 's suspension on mercosur to show you what 's the political condition venezuela has at the moment . 
  spoilers : not good . 
  we might even see a new junta soon if maduro gets overthrown . 
  it 's cool . 
  they are white enough for the police to control themselves from shooting .
