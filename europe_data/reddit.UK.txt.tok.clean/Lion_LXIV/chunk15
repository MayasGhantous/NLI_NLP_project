  there are many variants of liberalism . 
  the lib dems are the closest thing we have to a liberal party . 
   our system has show to have worked well if you take a long view of history . 
  let 's not take a long view of history . 
  it 's irrelevant . 
  let 's look at the current system and you 'll see that it does n't work . 
   uk is going to continue to grow faster economically and create more jobs than the eu is . 
  source ? 
  and one that is n't based of us still being in the eu and does n't take into account membership of the single market . 
  i support the lib dems . 
  but that 's pointless because fptp means the tories or labour will always be the largest party . 
  our democracy is terrible compared to most other european countries . 
  he 's a tory so he likely thinks the snoopers ' charter is a good thing . 
   people like weber get annoyed and ca n't handle the banter ( this is clearly a positive - they are already at maximum level frustration with the uk because of the referendum and brexit and there is no chance of this changing , therefore there is no downside in continuing to troll them , but there is an upside in the uk because it amuses brits ) this is exactly the attitude that makes me loathe so many people in this country . 
  i 'm glad i was born to european immigrants . 
  at least i have an escape route if this country continues to go down the drain . 
  unfortunately , the same ca n't be said for many of my friends . 
  better regulation under a tory government ? 
  they lobbied the eu to water down its environmental legislation . 
  not a chance . 
  and i do n't see any major issues with current eu regulations . 
  what are the benefits of leaving the single market ? 
  a continental breakfast is a british/irish thing . 
  i would say a lot of brits and irish people only have coffee and a pastry or slice of bread/toast for breakfast . 
  it is n't . 
  irish cuisine is n't any better than english cuisine . 
  i would say it 's worse . 
  [ some of them even cook naked ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-vq5ce5ags ) . 
  why , sweden ? 
  why would you do that to a pizza ? 
  [ they got the idea from sicily ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_pizza ) . 
  her parents were english . 
  she was born in france but left at age 5 . 
  switzerland is what happens when a german , italian , and french person have a threesome . 
  it defies the laws of nature but it somehow exists . 
  what country ? 
   they just widened the income gap between the wealthy and the working class but you must probably be part of the former given how you speak . 
  [ yep ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5deulm/95_of_new_workers_in_the_uk_are_foreigners/da41w7u/ ) . 
   modernist architecture and ideology . 
  not all modernist architecture . 
  just brutalist . 
   the legalisation of gay marriage , and keeping scotland in the union were both pretty nice . 
  most tories voted against . 
  the bill passed due to the liberal democrats and labour voting in favour . 
   some of the things that the tories are doing to the welfare state have encouraged more people to come off benefits and go into work . 
  you 're deluded . 
  here are some of the tories accomplishments .

  it 's pure spite . 
  compromises have to be made . 
  making luxembourg and malta share an mep is a ridiculous idea given that both countries have different needs . 
  malta and luxembourg should n't share an mep . 
  their separate countries . 
  i was referring to our electoral system . 
  i support the liberal democrats and we only have 1.2 % of seats despite having 8 % of the vote . 
  that is not meaningful representation . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  fptp is a terrible electoral system . 
  it favours labour and the tories over the smaller parties . 
  the snp are the exception . 
  fptp resulted in the tories being elected by only 33 % of the electorate . 
  it resulted in the snp 95 % of scotland 's seats despite only getting 50 % of the vote . 
  smaller parties ca n't adequately represent their supporters because they ca n't get fair representation . 
  fptp is not a good democratic system . 
   if you mean a body that provides meaningful representation for the people , then no . 
  the british parliament does not do that . 
  look at our electoral system as well . 
  the tories were elected by 36 % of the electorate . 
  smaller parties are unable to represent their supporters because they only get a small number of seats . 
  the benefits of having fptp . 
  the uk 's democracy is not healthy . 
  it was n't unless the legislation was concerning the [ enviroment ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/12/uk-lobbying-for-even-weaker-eu-air-pollution-laws-leaked-papers-show ) . 
   democratic reasons primarily . 
  the eu was an unbearable imposition on uk sovereignty and democracy . 
  it was n't . 
  nope . 
  many people . 
  we 're not the only ones . 
  i did n't downvote you . 
  do n't be one of those people . 
  we do n't . 
  parliament has supreme power . 
  that 's why people say they are sovereign . 
   i 'm sorry , but i think you 've bought the line that your government knows what it 's doing ... :p nope . 
  our constitution is not unwritten . 
  nothing you say will change that fact . 
  i 'm not a constitutional lawyer so i can go into detail on our constitution . 
  also , it 's uncodified , not unwritten . 
  what ? 
   can you really call it a `` constitutional crisis '' when they do n't even have one ? 
  a constitution does n't have to be codified . 
   if market let company to become monopoly , we shouldnt intervene , however , monopoly will obstruct the market , thus not making it free . 
  which of the problems are we going to adress ? 
  we should intervene . 
  one company assuming a monopoly and therefore having no viable competitors is not a free market . 
  it 's not good for the consumer . 
   libertarianism is a extension of liberal views . 
  libertarians want laissez-faire economic liberalism . 
  that 's on is on the right on the political spectrum in many european countries . 
  lassiez-faire economics will not solve our problems .
