  as you see , kazakhstan is a scene of liberal politics , liberal economics , and we wish that all the countries of the region would follow our example , walk in our footsteps in that we have created better conditions for our people than our neighbours . 
  '' * [ full speech . 
  ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1072923.html )  ok ; however , ca n't this infrastructure be modernized and expanded ? 
  it can but that 's unlikely given the current economic situation . 
   was n't this also true for ukraine before 2014 , though ? 
  they had relations with the west but i would n't say they were anything like the relations between kazakhstan and the west , especially when it comes to business . 
  ukraine has always been in a tug of war between russia and the west but that 's not the case for kazakhstan . 
  russia does have influence in kazakhstan but they do n't have the same grip on the country . 
   did n't ukraine have a lot of infrastructure which was left over from the days of the soviet union , though ? 
  yes but that was n't sufficient to meet the demands of the 21st century . 
  much of ukraine 's infrastructure is dated . 
  although , there are steadily making improvements . 
  the economic situation does n't help . 
  whereas , the economy has been good in kazakhstan since the early 2000s and they have n't suffered any major economic decline which means they are/were able to invest a lot more into their infrastructure . 
  other people have already mentioned kazakhstan 's vast natural resources . 
  but obviously there is more to it than that . 
  kazakhstan promotes itself as the business capital of central asia . 
  it offers good concessions to promote foreign investment . 
  they have also got good relations with western nations such as france , the uk , and the us while maintaining good relations with russia . 
  britain is one of the largest investors in kazakhstan . 
  bae own nearly 50 % of their flag carrier . 
  furthermore , kazakhstan has invested a lot into infrastructure which makes the country attractive to foreign investment . 
   just curious ... do we have to wait for uk 's statistics of hate crimes specifically against immigrants to become very huge to take any actions ? 
  what actions do you want to take ? 
  you ca n't do anything . 
  it 's a domestic issue . 
  not cartoons but the my favourite shows were by gerry anderson . 
  captain scarlet , stingray , and the thunderbirds . 
  also , thomas the tank engine is a british classic and fuck anyone who says otherwise . 
  although , i think it made it 's way over to america since they made a movie . 
  we do that to but in places like school/university/work and at a bar/parties . 
  shocking ? 
  where have you been ? 
  i have no problem with holding a door for someone . 
  i 'm not going to have a conversation with strangers on the tube because that 's just odd . 
  it is a word . 
  do n't lecture me on my own language . 
  catalonian can be used in english as well . 
  and those are poor comparisons . 
   i 'm only familiar with the republican campaign in the uk . 
  unfortunately they are a still a very fringe group , and their thunder has been stolen by brexit . 
  perhaps , with charles ' accession to the throne , it could change a bit . 
  their thunder has n't been stolen by brexit . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  the republicans never had any thunder . 
  they were irrelevant before brexit and they will be irrelevant after brexit . 
  hardly anyone pays attention to them . 
  most british people want to keep the monarchy . 
  charles accession to the throne wo n't have any significant changes . 
  william , kate , and harry are very popular , even among younger people , so they will ensure the monarchy continues . 
  i do n't mind about us having a monarchy . 
  i do n't see any reason for why we should change to a republic . 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  the eu ca n't force a country to be a member against its will . 
  bath or bristol . 
  greece , hungary , moldova , romania , and the slavic countries are in europe . 
  europe geographically ends at the urals . 
  that means part of kazakhstan is in europe . 
  weetibix is good . 
  owned by the chinese . 
  good people . 
  people who have coffee and a cigarette for breakfast make me laugh . 
  they usually start complaining about how hungry and tired they are . 
  have a proper breakfast then . 
  cereal , frys , porridge , and toast . 
  tea and coffee are the most common drinks . 
  some people will have juice . 
  coffee and a cigarette seems to a popular breakfast for many people . 
  i usually have oatmeal , muesli , or eggs . 
  oh come on . 
  we all know those non-tanned ` italians ' are austrians secretly taking over italy . 
  people use caravans but nothing like the huge rvs that you have in america . 
  i personally hate them . 
  holidaying in a caravan is my idea of hell . 
  and i hate driving behind them . 
  i think the scottish elections for westminster is another good example of how bad it is . 
  the snp got 50 % of the vote and 94 % of the seats in westminster . 
  i have things in common with people from all over the world but i 'm not going identify with them because there 's lots of differences as well . 
  united kingdom . 
  london . 
  the second one is n't true . 
  the uk is among the top countries with the healthiest teeth . 
  what freedoms would those be ? 
  a blend between estuary english and multicultral london english . 
  mle is has a lot of differences compared to other english dialects . 
  it 's influenced by the languages spoken by many of the immigrant communities in london . 
  [ doc brown explains it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ympi2mdabum ), 
  what ? 
  there 's lots of [ varieties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porridge#varieties ) . 
  london has warm ( for us ) summers . 
  it hovers around the mid 20s most of the time . 
  the highest temperature we got this year was 33c . 
  i like geography . 
  i 've just heard a lot of those places on american tv shows/games and i have family in america .
