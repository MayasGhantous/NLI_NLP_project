  i felt uncomfortable even clicking a comments link from / r/europe for months , because i knew * exactly * what i 'd find inside . 
  i even had to delete my last account after getting sick of people pming racist abuse at me , largely as a consequence of my posting here . 
  if you did n't even notice a hint of a problem , you just were n't here enough . 
  there are ample funnier things one could say in that subreddit . 
  stuff like that takes genuine malice to concoct . 
  it 's necessary . 
  the place used to have a * huge * racism problem until damned recently . 
  it went way beyond just civil discussion - it ended up derailing just about every vaguely political thread into hateful battlefields for months . 
  drove a fair few people away . 
  i think the mods are doing a great job . 
  if people want to fellate golden dawn 's proposals for the preservation of the racial purity of the hellenic master race , they 're more than welcome to - but they can damned well do it elsewhere . 
  not the best of examples , but [ here 's the first that springs to mind ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/zrd6o/channel_4_in_uk_cancels_islam_documentary/c674n7f ) - i 've had the fellow tagged with a link to that for a while , given his prominence in / r/ukpolitics . 
  that 's relatively mild . 
  there was a phase a couple of months ago where pro-golden dawn comments were hitting net positive vote scores . 
  some of the comments [ in this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/113a2w/meta_on_the_rising_levels_of_racism_in_this/ ) demonstrate how bad things were fairly recently . 
  full credit to the moderators , though - things have improved enormously since then , and they 're doing their job brilliantly . 
  bravo to them . 
  [ somewhere in texas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/earth,_texas ) , apparently . 
  the liberal democrats are a shell of their former selves , but there 's just no other unequivocally pro-european option worth a damn left out there . 
  i ca n't believe i 'm reduced to this . 
  i 've met lib dem meps before - there 's such a vacuum of talent there . 
  i love that this sort of thing is getting soundly downvoted now . 
  / r/europe 's changed for the better . 
  canary wharf would be a start . 
  do you get all your political knowledge from [ spitting image ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reiana459sg ) ? 
   it would be like naming a street of london after berlusconi . 
  most people would find that hilarious . 
  chomsky 's a lot more than just a linguist . 
  he 's not some celebrity amateur warbling on about things he does n't understand . 
  possibly a bit awkward , so long as argentina and the uk remain within their respective groups . 
  i think you do the soviets a disservice there . 
  awful ? 
  sure . 
  a touch far ? 
  africa . 
  it 's ** a ** name for the area . 
  not the only name !, 
  why 's it always finns making these jokes on / r/europe ? 
  odd thing i 've noticed - i do n't think i 've ever seen commenters from the rest of the eu waffle on like this . 
  [ it 's - a wonderful day !, 
  ] ( http://www.oramuoiodammitempo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/silvio_berlusconi.jpg ), 
  a passing glance at your comment history suggests that you are , in fact , everything that you seem . 
  i hope your children all marry africans when they grow up . 
   for the uk to take on all cypriot debt what 's that i hear ? 
  is it the sound of this government , elected on a platform whose sole substantive element was to cut reduce britain 's structural deficit , losing the next election ? 
   i do n't really get why the countries linked above only made male homosexuality illegal but not female homosexuality . 
  because they 're , by and large , led by men . 
  i saw mary kaldor give a lecture a few years ago - absolutely outstanding theorist . 
  thoroughly recommend picking up a copy of `` new and old wars '' , if you 've got access to a university library . 
  [ birmingham ] ( http://maysbrumblog.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/fet-soc.html ) and [ york ] ( http://www.yusu.org/activities/societies/1119 ) have both had similar societies for some time now - ghent 's hardly the first . 
  good idea , though !, 
  if they want it , they 're more than welcome to it . 
  they 're bloody isolated , after all - i can understand their wanting some level of autonomy . 
  something inane to the effect of  would there be all this fracas if the man was black and making the salute ? 
  this is ** anti-white racism !, 
  ** and i am very very angry because my mother wo n't pay for my world of warcraft subscription this month which is obviously another manifestation of reverse racism - help , help - i 'm being oppressed !, 
   so , i was wearing my confederate flag t-shirt at taco bell when the bitch behind the counter was like , `` that shirt is racist . '', 
  i could n't believe it . 
  `` actually , '' i explained , `` the civil war was about states ' rights , not slavery . '', 
  i considered walking out then and there but was really hungry for a chalupa . 
  so , i handed the female my $ 2 bill , but -- and i guess i should n't be surprised , considering the level of education in this country -- she refused to accept it . 
  `` it 's legal tender ! '', 
  i said . 
  `` you can not refuse it !, 
  it is my right to use it ! '', 
  she would n't budge , claiming that there was no place in the register for $ 2 bills . 
  ( for fuck 's sake . ), 
  `` alright , '' i said , handing her my $ 1 coins . 
  i was half expecting her to raise a stink about that , but she did n't . 
  i guess there 's still some hope . 
  `` no need to be so niggardly , '' i said . 
  she flipped . 
  `` niggardly , '' i said , `` not n *** erly . 
  do n't you know the difference ? '', 
  anyways , as i left , i raised my arm in a roman salute , and another bitch behind the counter shrieked : `` nazi !, 
  oh my god , he 's a skinhead ! '', 
  i could n't believe what i was hearing ; i am not a racist , and i am not a nazi . 
  `` actually , '' i calmly and coolly explained , `` before this salute was co-opted by the nazis , it was the symbol of french republicans , and before that , it was a common greeting in ancient rome . 
  but i guess they do n't teach you that in school anymore , do they ? '', 
  seriously , why should world war ii overrule two thousand years ' worth of western history ? 
  anyways , as i left , an older gentleman came up to me , and placed his hand on my arm . 
  `` thank you , '' he said . 
  `` i fought in world war ii , and i 'll be damned if we let the nazis win . '', 
  `` no , '' i replied , `` thank you for your service . '', 
  ( although , i sort of suspected that the us government had placed him there for propaganda purposes . ), 
  i got into my car and ate my chalupa with a feeling of accomplishment . 
  if things actually went hot , we 'd probably send at least a token military presence - the un * would * get involved , given the stakes , and we 'd be all but obliged to lend some support . 
  it would n't have to be a full-scale deployment - we 'd just need to be seen to be there , upholding international law . 
  but it 's nothing to do with the language itself , though - though i 'm sure he 's joking . 
  anglo/american liberalism 's made its way across the world even in the absence of the language . 
  oh , yes - but they 're vanishingly rare nowadays . 
  i 've only ever met two people with accents like that under the age of thirty - the rest are all well into advanced age . 
  i particularly loved the part where he implied that the english language is acting as a trojan horse for liberalism . 
  oh , france . 
  that hungarian mep 's got an astonishingly old-fashioned english accent . 
  quite charming , really - i wonder how he managed to pick up something like that . 
  he would n't be all that out of place in pre-war bbc broadcasts . 
  only the most delusional of activists could deny that the harm done by the average male circumcision is whole worlds less extreme than that of fgm . 
  it 's easy enough to live a fully functional life with no foreskin . 
  you 're implying an equivalence that just does n't exist .
