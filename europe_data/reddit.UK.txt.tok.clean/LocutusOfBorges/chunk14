   not censoring every opinion you did n't like . 
  i never called for that , at any point . 
  objecting to essay-length screeds on white nationalism and every other thread descending into allegations that voting for a vaguely left-wing party entails complicity in child abuse hardly means i want to censor `` everything '' . 
  basic quality control matters for keeping a subreddit readable !, 
   see this is the sort of thing i mean , anyone that you disagree with is a ` far right ' bogeyman , i 'm not a fan of labels , but just in case you were implying i 'm ` far-right ' , i consider myself in the centre somewhere . 
  you 're a ukip supporter !, 
  in what world are they centrist ? 
  i get on just fine with plenty of ukip voters in real life , but the party itself hardly tacks toward the centre . 
  ** edit ** : ... and apparently repeatedly shadowbanned from / r/unitedkingdom and / r/europe in the past , going by your ( extremely short ) user history . 
  i think i have a pretty good idea what your previous account was . 
  oh , christ . 
  i remember that thread - the op was a throwaway of my previous account . 
  it really was getting * bad * back then . 
  i 'd even started getting abusive pms from some of the more hysterical extreme right folks - i ended up deleting my primary account to avoid doxing . 
  the moderation got a lot more effective within a month or two of that post and a few others like it - the place has never quite been like it was at the sub-10k mark since , but it 's still pretty well managed . 
  however obviously intrusive this is , it would n't surprise me to find that this is simply formalising what 's already been happening at a higher level . 
  the uk and usa probably have means of intercepting traffic passing through their territory in place . 
  all this sems to be doing is providing a simpler way for a government to achieve the same kind of thing . 
  i 've helped run / r/britishpolitics for coming up on a full year now - i do n't think we 've had any cases of `` feelings getting in the way '' with regard to the way we 've moderated - certainly not in the way i 've moderated . 
  of course , / r/britishpolitics was built from the ground up with a mandate to moderate heavily for the sake of keeping the place a pleasant community to spend time in . 
  that 's necessitated active moderation - but i think we 've been fairly even-handed . 
  i , and the rest of the team , moderate to the letter and spirit of the rules - that 's it . 
  we have n't once banned anyone at a whim sans justification , and we 've always been open about it . 
  i appreciate that a small number of people on the far right have a problem with me , but their views certainly have no grounding in my moderation record . 
  i was hoping we 'd be spared reference to this drama . 
  for anybody inclined to examine the history of / r/britishpolitics , a brief overview can be found [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/britishpolitics/wiki/whybritishpolitics ) - an archived self post 's linked from there listing a number of examples of why we thought things were in a sufficiently bad state at the time to warrant creating a new community . 
  it 's been almost a year since then . 
  this is dredging up ancient history , frankly - we 've long since moved on . 
   i remember him from / r/unitedkingdom ( or / r/ukpolitics ) where even there he thought the sub was too right wing for criticising islam , immigration and multiculturalism . 
  i suggest that anybody interested in exactly what 's meant by `` criticising islam , immigration and multiculturalism '' examine the linked wiki page above . 
  i doubt many would view the treatment of the topics you now find on / r/european all that innocent - that 's * exactly * what , in / r/ukpolitics , drove us to call for some remedial action on the matter for some time , and finally , in desperation , start up an alternative . 
  actively taking measures to deal with far-right brigading from / pol / and the like is a * good thing * for the health of a community . 
  / r/ukpolitics has improved a bit nowadays , but it was absolutely awful last year - we had good reason to split off . 
  it 's one thing to have open and frank discussion about things like immigration and race , but it 's another entirely to have thread after thread derailed into racist , exclusionary , back-patting circlejerks . 
  it 's what 's rendered a good chunk of this site 's defaults completely unreadable - stepping in and dealing with the issue as places like / r/europe have done is laudable . 
   he then went and created / r/britishpolitics , which is essentially a hard left hug box . 
  / r/britishpolitics ? 
  a `` hard left hug box '' ? 
  ridiculous !, 
  have you ever even set foot there ? 
  we 're run by a lib dem , two unaligned mods , a blairite and a ukip member , and our userbase is , frankly , moderate - we tend towards the centre-left , but that 's more a result of the circumstances of the place 's formation than any active effort on our part . 
  if anything , we welcome right/libertarian-leaning posters with open arms - balance makes debate far more interesting . 
  it 's a `` hugbox '' in the sense that / r/europe is , now it 's shorn of the people that have now congregated in / r/european . 
  ** edit ** : cut back for brevity 's sake . 
  nobody should have to read about this tedious drama all over again . 
   please ensure our new mod is n't a muslim or anything that would potentially influence his decisions as moderator . 
  ... seriously ? 
  what are you after - a team of robots ? 
  i might as well give it a shot - i 've been a regular visitor here for pushing six years now across multiple accounts , and it 's still one of my favourite subreddits by some way - however much it 's changed over the years . 
  i 'm / u/locutusofborges , and i 'm from the uk . 
  as far as the guidelines go ? 
  * ** age ** : this account 's two and a half years old . 
  * ** daily visits ** : easily . 
  i usually check in continually over the day , and monitor my modqueue as often as i can . 
  * ** experience ** : i 've been an active moderator on / r/android ( 547,000 subscribers ) for several months now , one of the founding moderators of / r/britishpolitics ( 2,600 ) , moderate / r/androidquestions ( 19,500 ) , and a scattering of joke/meta subreddits . 
  interview questions follow :  do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  extensive experience with automoderator - we 've been using it on / r/britishpolitics for going on a full year now , and i 've built up some familiarity with its more advanced features going by / r/android 's automoderator configuration . 
  i 've some experience actively using the mod toolbox , and i 've tweaked preexisting advanced configurations ( again , / r/android ) - but i would n't say i 'd be confident of setting up a configuration from scratch . 
  css experience is minimal - i 've modified existing stylesheets in subreddits i mod in the past , but nothing too serious . 
   what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  gmt . 
  i 'm on reddit at irregular hours during the day , but most active between 7pm and 4am . 
  ( i do most of my work at night - having reddit open alongside helps things . ), 
   what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe favourite ? 
  the diversity , overwhelmingly . 
  i 've encountered so many perspectives here i 'd never have had the slightest possibility of finding elsewhere - and having a large , thriving subreddit not dominated by americans makes for some unique conversation . 
  it 's a window into parts of the world you just do n't find elsewhere on this site - and the quality of discussion is * fantastic * in the main , where serious topics are concerned . 
  where it 's actively managed , this is one of the best subreddits site-wide - it 's somewhere that subscribers will learn more about the wider world than in any of the major us/uk-centric subs , simply by virtue of the sheer breadth of its userbase . 
  i 've learned so much about the politics and culture of eu ( and outside ) countries i just would n't have even known a thing about beyond their position just by reading this place over the past few years . 
  it 's really something special . 
  least favourite ? 
  afraid i 'm going to have to be predictable and say the racism - but , frankly , i think the mod team 's done an absolutely fantastic job of dealing with it over the past two years . 
  it 's been cleaned up from a continually-erupting tinderbox to being one of the more pleasant defaults around by some way . 
  where it crops up now , it 's * usually * removed in fairly short order following a report - and the overall quality of discussion has stayed at an unusually high level , given the size of the community . 
  i would n't say it 's a major problem now - it 's being handled pretty well . 
  that said , there are still occasions where surges of far-right folks appear and massively derail threads before they 're dealt with - there 's only so much that can be done about that , but i expect the addition of some more moderators will certainly help there . 
   what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  sticking to your guns on the bigotry/hate speech/anti-personal attack ruleset you put out last month . 
  * bravo * on that - it 's exactly the sort of thing the place needs , above anything else . 
  if the place can be kept a non-toxic environment , i do n't see any reason why it should n't remain a friendly , welcoming place to spend time even when it breaks a million readers . 
  additionally , it would n't hurt to see a little more prominence for the irc channel ? 
  i mostly lurk on #europe , but it could use a bit more prominence in the subreddit stylesheet - irc adds a fair amount to the reddit experience , and the channel does n't really stand out all that much in the sidebar at the moment . 
  on / r/britishpolitics , we 've made the channel one of the centrepieces of the subreddit - we run regular , publicised chat events alongside big national events , and it 's worked out quite well . 
  some more prominence for the `` report '' button in any future css revision would be a good thing , as well - particularly given the recent ruleset revision . 
  reporting tends to work fine for helping the userbase shunt things into the modqueue , but only if they 're actively encouraged to do it - perhaps giving the link a red shadow/outline would help there ? 
   what would make you a good moderator ? 
  i genuinely enjoy moderating in a way that means continual engagement with the userbase - seeing / r/britishpolitics grow into a place with an active community of regulars , regular events , and a positive culture 's been one of the most rewarding experiences i 've got out of this website . 
  i 'd like to give being an active mod a shot on / r/europe - the place is * huge * , but it 's still one of the most interesting subreddits on the website . 
  i used to adore the place back when it was sub-10k subscribers , and the fact that it 's still actually readable at this size is a great sight . 
  i try to be an active community mod , more than anything else - stepping in and defusing flame wars before they get to the point where bans start getting handed out , talking problem users down in pms , and being as transparent as i can in the mod actions i take personally - if i remove a comment or post , i leave a note with an explanation , or follow up with the user in question afterward if they complain . 
  i 've found that if you give things a personal touch , and try and be reasonable with users , most situations can be defused - to the greater benefit of the community . 
  what matters is n't simply thwacking extremists with a stick - it 's making sure the community remains a place where people both enjoy spending time , and * get something out of * . 
  reddit 's morphed into something more complex than the link aggregator it used to be - it 's the world 's largest forum , nowadays . 
  seeing larger subreddits devolve into something as impersonal and unmanaged as a newspaper 's comments section is a crying shame - it 's fantastic to see / r/europe 's still coping with things even at this size . 
  that said , i get through a fairly large chunk of spam/publicity filtering on a daily basis on / r/android 's modqueue - i pull my weight , and try to get to every report i notice within a decent timeframe if i 'm at a computer or an android device ( alien blue 's moderation toolkit still being , alas , a mess . ), 
  additionally - i 've spent the past ten months building up a subreddit defined ( at least initially ) by the same kind of anti-hate speech/bigotry ruleset / r/europe adopted a few weeks back - i know the scale disparity between the two subreddits is enormous , but i 've also spent several months moderating / r/android - substantially larger than / r/europe . 
  after that experience , i still think that an active moderation style can work with larger subreddits - it just needs a fair amount of active manpower to manage . 
  i 'd like to lend a hand in a bigger community centred around a subject and part of the world i 'm hugely interested in . 
  what a contemptible shitstain the man is . 
  i think the mods are doing as decent a job as anyone could hope for , given the sheer scale of the place now .
