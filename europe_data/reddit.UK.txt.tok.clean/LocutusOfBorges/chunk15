  obligatory / r/britishpolitics plug . 
  we 're a fair bit less insane . 
   blocking holocaust deniers is literally the worst thing since the thing-that-didn ` t-happen really . 
  these are damned basic , simple , * lenient * rules . 
  if people want to jerk themselves raw over discussions about racial superiority , they can do so with like-minded sorts in / r/european . 
  til banning holocaust deniers is a bad thing . 
  bravo for doing this . 
  we 've had no end of carping on / r/britishpolitics about our racism/bigotry ban-on-sight policy . 
  so heartening to see a sub as successful as / r/europe manage to stay well run . 
  you clearly do n't remember how bad things got a year and a half ago before the mod team really started tightening up their act . 
  they 've done a tremendous job . 
  that the place has gone from being halfway flooded with racism flame wars in 2012 , to a genuinely enjoyable subreddit with * hundreds of thousands * of subscribers today paints them all in an extremely good light . 
   then why was it upvoted with positive comments if overall you do n't want it ? 
  a passing glance at / r/funny ought to be sufficient to disabuse anyone of the notion that upvotes indicate quality content . 
  let the moderators do their jobs , take the shitposting to / r/yurop . 
  the russians give france a decent run for their money . 
  do you actually lie awake at night in fear of spermjacking ? 
  join us today for another exciting episode of : '' / r/europe or stormfront ? '', 
  if a russian were saying something similar about ukraine , this sub would be absolutely up in arms . 
  so you 're perfectly comfortable with saying that british rule in ireland was * good * for the people there ? 
  consider acting in a way that does n't warrant the label . 
   no need for name calling , at least try to be civil . 
  anyone inclined to upvote this disingenuous arsewipe for the sentiment might want to bear in mind the fact that [ british imperial policy in ireland resulted in the death of at least a * million * of its population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_ ( ireland \\ ) ) , and that the island 's population * still * has n't recovered to pre-famine levels . 
  india was n't civilised before the british arrived ? 
  india had sophisticated urban societies and a rich literary tradition back when the british were still painting themselves blue and shoving sharpened sticks at one another . 
  british imperial policy in india killed millions . 
  [ * wilfully * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_of_1876%e2%80%9378 ) , even . 
  that we do n't even teach children that our policies killed almost as many people as died in the * holocaust * ( substantially more across the duration of british rule , even ) is a tragedy - as is the fact that our children can leave school with some vague , nebulous understanding of empire along the lines of `` we did a few slightly bad things , but we build them * railways * ! '', 
   baltic states have less extreme minorities . 
  25 % of the population of estonia is russian . 
   the united states gains nothing from nato the us gains allies , a permanent sphere of influence , primacy in world affairs , and trading deals with the largest economic bloc in the world . 
   the eu is rich enough to provide an adequate military force for common defense if they want to . 
  it 's not actually capable of it . 
  we do n't have a single unified european army , and we 're too dependent upon nato 's force structure to fight a major war alone . 
  it 'd take a * long * time to build up the infrastructure and forces necessary to stand without the us . 
  tell that to ukraine . 
  not about to disagree . 
  i was hoping that this might spark a bit of debate , given how much anti-nato stuff 's cropping up in certain segments of the uk 's left these days - but eh . 
  [ i 'd just want to ask him if this was actually serious ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ahtyrangag ) . 
  i think it 's okay , actually . 
  teaching quality varies * hugely * , but it does n't take up much of the students ' time - and it 's important to give them some kind of understanding of the wider world . 
  and you post on / r/theredpill . 
  so does england . 
  it 's called `` religious education '' , and it 's been taught in schools for decades . 
  it 's completely and utterly harmless . 
  basic human equality really is n't . 
  but , of course , you post to / r/theredpill . 
  of * course * you 're going to take issue with such * unprecedented * ideas as women being equal to men . 
  why bother ? 
  you post on / r/kotakuinaction - that 's about as big a red flag as can be held up that you 've already made your mind up immovably . 
  that 's my university , and there 's * far * more to it than that than the stock anecdote the kia crowd have taken to using it as . 
  if you want to blame anyone , blame that walking turd yiannopoulos for inflaming the situation to such an extent that he started setting his twitter mob on individual york students . 
  you clearly have absolutely no understanding of what feminism actually is . 
  shockingly , the election of barack obama to the presidency did n't make racial inequality in the u.s. instantly disappear . 
  the same 's the case for thatcher . 
   nothing should be unquestionable . 
  racial and gender equality are , and should be unquestionable in a decent , civilised society . 
  if you think otherwise , i invite you to wander over to / r/european with the rest of your sorry ilk . 
  i appreciate that i 'm probably wasting my breath here , given your history in / r/kotakuinaction , but gender equality is n't up for debate in 21st century europe . 
  and ** that 's exactly what feminism is ** . 
  lovely idea . 
  hopefully it 'll at least make the kids think . 
  use the report function . 
  give the mods a hand . 
  '' [ an independence from europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independence_from_europe ) '' . 
  i 'd call them inadvertent patriots , personally - if only for the frothing rage their existence sent ukip into . 
  i do n't even think their names are especially similar - the only thing they share is `` independence '' . 
  if people could n't tell the difference between that and ukip , they were probably voting at random . 
  also notable for their [ absolutely hilarious election broadcasts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqqooml3qwa ) . 
  really looking forward to this . 
  notably , the only remaining british alde mep after last year 's wipeout . 
  what does morocco gain by remaining morocco ? 
  is n't merging with algeria more important ? 
  you 'll have access to both citizenships , so it would n't change much for you . 
  the borders would be open , you could circulate freely . 
  ... etc. 
  it 's a national identity thing - not to mention the fact that the two sides of the troubles in the north * hate * each other to the point that [ their neighbourhoods within the same cities are walled off from each other to stop them fighting in the streets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_lines ) . 
  i love how this post 's comments are ample demonstration that the answer to this question is `` yes '' . 
  if i were him , i 'd stay as far away from nato states as i could . 
  russia 's about the safest place the man could possibly be . 
  poland were heavily involved as well . 
  it was n't just an anglo-american thing . 
  try refreshing the page ? 
  that worked for me . 
  alternatively , a good samaritan 's [ transcribed the full article over at / r/ukpolitics ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3q1se7/littler_england_the_united_kingdoms_retreat_from/ ) . 
  open it in an incognito/private browsing window - it 'll display fine !, 
  * foreign affairs * is n't really a newspaper - it 's one of the most high-status international relations-centric journals . 
  if it 's good enough to make it into the thing , it 's generally worth reading . 
  i 've no objection to conservatism - i get most of my news from conservative-leaning sources . 
  but it 's ridiculous to say o'neill is n't a contrarian - the man practically revels in his status . 
  if there 's any popular issue hitting the headlines , you can practically set your clock by how long it takes for him to come out with a snarky column about it - whether it 's snowden , fox hunting , cameron 's pig incident kim kardashian 's arse , he 'll find a way to call everyone an idiot . 
   or do you have an example of a ( recent ) piece of his that you consider trashy ? 
  [ this one ] ( http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/09/jeremy-corbyn-isnt-a-man-of-the-people-hes-a-man-against-the-people/ ) was pretty daft . 
  it does n't make a constructive point about veganism or animal rights activism at all - it just jeers and calls them `` killjoys '' . 
  whatever your position on animal rights , that column is idiotic . 
   by contrast , when i attend animal-rights gatherings -- strictly to observe , not partake -- i 'm always startled by the incredible elitism of these middle-class meat-dodgers . 
  vegans are the worst . 
  worldbeaters in smugness , they view themselves as toxin-free , unpolluted by wicked , flesh-selling capitalism . 
  the rest of us maccyd-scoffing masses are , by contrast , corrupted carnivores , in need of saving , who must have images of imprisoned bunny rabbits thrust into our hands as we slavishly shop for more ` stuff ' on a saturday afternoon . 
  i 'd be surprised if he 'd ever actually been to an animal rights related event , let alone actually listened to the arguments involved .
