  does n't sound like it was a decision reached lightly at all . 
  poor woman . 
   ** #europe irc : **   7:40 pm < must_warn_others  i stickied this thread for you guys to shitpost in let 's not disappoint , folks . 
  and khan , quite rightly , told him where to stick it . 
  it 's on the same level as being offered `` honorary white '' status while visiting south africa under apartheid - it 's an insult . 
  a large part of the tory right 's platform for the past thirty years has been rolling back as many of these things as they possibly can . 
  these are the people currently in control of the country , and certain to continue to be in that position until 2025 - * at least * . 
  what do you think the `` brussels red tape '' schtick refers to ? 
   british euroscepticism was reaching a boiling point had it been held in even five years ' time , demographic shifts would have resulted in a fairly strong remain result . 
   contained you mean , of course , incubated . 
  and why do you think they want that ? 
   not even the leadership is opposed to leaving the eu . 
  actually , they are . 
  party policy is still to fight for britain to remain in the eu in any second referendum . 
  worth noting that owen `` unprincipled '' smith is sticking to his word and voting against a50 , while everyone 's favourite tory enabler greases the wheels . 
   can someone eli5 how britain , which is on its way out of the eu , can in any way influence the decision of the eu ? 
  it ca n't . 
  our present government , however , is run by idiots that * think * it can . 
  does everything have to be viewed through the prism of the american elections seriously, 
  j'ai l'impression d'exploser . 
  j'ai une putain de panne . 
  stupid man . 
  the worst foreign policy disaster since suez . 
   i do n't think you get the point of reclaiming do you i have absolutely zero desire to `` reclaim '' a festival i primarily associate with shitfaced racists shouting `` fucking paki '' at people as they walk down the street . 
  the face of acceptable english nationalism is british nationalism - we 're ~ 90 % of the country 's population . 
  english nationalism , in the modern age , is something largely constructed to suit the ends of the person plugging it . 
  st. george 's day `` celebrations '' , in the average english city , amounts to large numbers of dipshits in football shirts getting drunk then pissing up the side of buildings and jeering at passing brown people . 
  it 's not an especially pleasant festival . 
  far too associated with football culture to be worth reclaiming .

  of course they 're the sort of person that has no problem with st. george 's day . 
   it does n't have to though ? 
  in the long term , perhaps . 
  now ? 
  english nationalism is taboo with reason - it 's been largely co-opted by some bloody nasty tendencies in society . 
  i 've got you tagged as a golden dawn supporter . 
  nice to see you playing to type . 
  that 's going a bit too far back to be relevant , i 'd say . 
  the tories have a long , illustrious history of courting the russian right . 
  this is nothing new . 
   the liberal democrats are fucked ( their typical voters will turn to the green party ) not to question the validity of the first half of your analysis - but the greens ? 
  pushing it a bit , surely ? 
  most of them have switched to labour . 
   everyone applying for an ni number has to have an interview . 
  really ? 
  i do n't recall having to do that , and i 've lived here my entire life . 
  move west . 
  we 're not so bad . 
  unionist patriots genuinely scare me . 
  when a politician starts invoking patriotic imagery/waving flags/asserting `` britishness '' on the mainland , people think they 're either dangerously insane or an overt racist . 
  that it 's so damned prevalent in northern ireland is terrifying . 
  nationalism gone insane . 
  tragic business . 
  i just do n't see any problem with this . 
  if this were an exhaustive history of every citizen in britain , from cradle to grave , there 'd be a serious issue - but this ? 
  keeping track of children , entirely under the government 's care for six hours a day for the majority of the year ? 
  if the database does n't keep track of kids after they leave the education system , this is a * good * thing . 
  the private sector 's shown itself time and time again to be entirely capable of managing information security - there 's no serious reason why the government 's necessarily incapable of doing so - particularly after the stick labour got whilst they were in power on the issue . 
   alexandra has been an outspoken member of ukip after defecting from the conservatives in march . 
  she classes herself as an anarcho-libertarian and believes taxation to be legalised theft . 
  it 's so rare to find a genuine , honest-to-god , completely non-ironic commonwealth advocate these days . 
  finding one so devoted to the cause that they delete their account rather than face the shame of being wrong 's even better . 
  europe still in the middle , at the top ? 
  yep . 
  still fine . 
  such a shame opera has n't got more traction . 
  if it were n't for its not supporting true per-pixel trackpad scrolling , i 'd still be using it today . 
  such a lovely browser . 
  less objectionable . 
  it 's not implying that any of them are n't american . 
  excuse me ? 
  these clowns were n't attacking people in the street because they were of a different culture - they were threatening to bash in their skulls with bricks because of the colour of their skin , their accent , and unusual headwear . 
  there 's no justification for the way they acted . 
  you have n't even bothered to read my post properly , you tit . 
  it 's like making a joke about the last u.s. presidential race and referring to the candidates as `` an american and a black man '' . 
  that it 's a joke has absolutely no bearing on how fundamentally shitty a thing it is to say . 
  calling something a joke does n't excuse objectionable content . 
  if i went into a pub and told a joke along the lines of `` an englishman , a scotsman and a black person walked into a bar '' , i 'd deserve a punch to the face . 
  this does the same thing . 
  you 're either spectacularly oblivious to context , or just being an ass . 
  i 've got you tagged as pro-golden dawn . 
  nice to see you 're playing to type . 
   then present unbiased and factual information on the issue and deconstruct the fabrications and myths the tabloids have been creating over the years . 
  a year ago i , and the thousands of other people who campaigned in the last referendum we held , would have agreed with you . 
  no longer . 
  that 's just not how referendum campaigns work in britain . 
  `` democracy '' counts for damned little when disinformation campaigns curry far greater weight with the electorate and are backed by * the entire media * . 
   you ca n't not run a referendum and ignore popular opinion i 'd agree , if the opinions being ignored were held with any measure of sound backing . 
  the overwhelming majority of people who 'd vote against continued eu membership do n't even know what the eu is - it 's so damned fickle , and , more crucially , * any campaign to stay in would stand at an immense structural disadvantage * . 
   because we 're too stupid to decide for ourselves and our representatives are an enlightened bunch ? 
  clearly , you 've never read a british tabloid . 
   do n't you have like free airtime for all parties to expose their views and stuff like that whenever there 's a referendum or an election ? 
  as has been said elsewhere - it sounds like you are n't aware of just how profound an impact * decades * of tabloid propaganda have had on the national discourse on europe . 
  for a voting public so widely apathetic , whose political opinions are drawn almost entirely from the pages of the sun and daily mail , educating themselves on the issue will be too great a stretch to bother with - they 'll just vote `` no '' because they once read that the eu spends some of their tax money - and * heaven forbid that any foreigner should do that !, 
  * there would n't even * be * a `` debate '' . 
  it 'd be like arguing for racial equality in 1950s texas . 
  if you 're leaving the country for the sake of slightly more sunlight and a return to `` traditional values '' , chances are you wo n't be missed . 
   1919-1922 was n't quite `` centuries '' ago this much ought to be obvious - but the point being made 's that vanishingly few people alive today have any recollection of that period . 
  it 's akin to france considering germany its eternal arch-nemesis as a consequence of 1914-1918 . 
  ... although .
