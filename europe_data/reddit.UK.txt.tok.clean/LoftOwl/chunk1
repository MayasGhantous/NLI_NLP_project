holestrip one par 1984, 
   like the rest of europe triggered . 
  i do n't think it officially is , it 's just commonly used . 
  only irish people ever seem to mind but a bit of sensitivity on our side would n't hurt , `` these islands '' or british-irish isles seem to be the preferred terms . 
  summer only lasts a month here , we can handle it, 
  no , only the irish ex we sometimes drunk text and our longtime and eternal ally portugal are worthy enough to bathe in the glorious glow of greenwich mean time . 
  i know reddit loves him but this guy often makes silly mistakes , england , wales , scotland and northern ireland are n't sovereign and the british isles is a term neither country officially uses . 
  how ridiculously pedantic . 
  i 'd assume the poster was referring to the majority of companies buying their offices when london was transforming itself into a service based banking hub , therefore the property was cheaper as demand was lower . 
  scotland is texting france about the auld alliance, 
  huh , fair play actually , that term was used upon further research , although it seems to be fairly unofficial . 
  however , it 's just a name , the uk could completely fall apart and `` united kingdom of england '' would probably be england 's full name . 
  actually , `` united kingdom '' was n't used until ireland was added , it was just the `` kingdom of great britain '' before then so as long as northern ireland sticks around , it 's technically the uk . 
  wales is part of england when it 's convenient, 
  yes , correct , sorry about that, 
  well , fair play then, 
  they 're the second largest party in the scottish ~ ~ government ~ ~ parliament, 
  just like how mean old england was totally gon na vote remain, 
  would you accept those australian terms for a referendum on scottish independence ? 
  would a super-majority and every council area being for yes being the requirement be democratic ? 
  scotland is * incredibly * sparsely populated , that makes it more expensive to maintain than most other parts of the uk . 
  the scottish government also receives a block grant rather than raising its own funds , so the defect in scotland 's budget is covered by the uk . 
  yeah i know , i was mostly just taking the piss . 
  with the way the snp have been talking though , you 'd think the 2 + years they 'd have likely been out would have been the worst thing ever . 
  it 's not to fit my rhetoric at all , eu support in scotland went from 50/50 to up to 70/30 in the polls as it became clear it was an snp red line and a stick to beat the union with . 
  i 'm not saying ** all ** of them voted for that , but do n't act like the constitutional question and tactical voting was n't a factor . 
  the question asked why did scotland vote to remain , and i do n't buy this apparent deep ideological difference between scotland and england as an answer . 
  well , yeah , obviously the uk is not as big as the entire eu , no country is ( except for the us post-brexit ), 
  [ only 15 % of no voters did ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/20/scottish-independence-lord-ashcroft-poll ), 
  some reasons for scotland to vote remain - it receives a tiny amount of immigration compared to england and wales , so one of the biggest arguments has no effect - they have their own government which weakens the sovereignty argument , as any powers would have to be transferred away from the scottish parliament ( * incredibly * unlikely ) and then transferred away from the uk parliament , england does n't have a parliament and wales ' is weaker than scotland 's , so it 's easier to view the eu as a long term threat to sovereignty . 
  - if you 're a nationalist , you 'd vote remain and quietly hope the uk votes out , so you get another referendum on independence - if you 're a unionist , you 'd vote remain hoping to make remain win across the uk , so you can avoid another referendum on independence the appeal to both sides of the yes/no debate ( which is currently dominating scottish politics ) was a huge help to the scottish remain vote . 
  however , you must remember it voted to remain as part of a large country with quite a few opt outs , and even then there was nearly a 40 % leave vote , if it was a vote on whether or not scotland should be in the eu as a small country that must commit to the euro and schengen , the answer may not be so enthusiastic . 
  what interests me is that the snp are horrified now about scotland not being in the eu , when they were perfectly happy to take it out of it by leaving the uk a few years ago , it 's * almost * like this is more about winning independence at any cost than it is being an eu member . 
  settle down mate , it 's still the 5th largest economy , unsc permanent member and has the world 's largest financial centre , even when that slips to second place after brexit the uk will still be `` up there '', 
  many countries were unified through conquest , ours being through shady political dealings is n't perfect but still probably ranks fairly highly in terms of origin stories . 
  surely that desperation shows they were n't planning on going `` nah , fuck off '' if you did vote yes . 
  oh i 'm well aware northern ireland has that right , i 'm more questioning how you feel about that . 
  ah yes , once again it 's history that should define our politics rather than modern democracy , if there 's something europe needs it 's more of that . 
  but i guess that 's a no from you on ni 's self determination . 
  sorry to hear you do n't respect northern ireland 's right to self determination, 
  yeah , one is holding on to events that happened generations ago and using them to criticise a country and it 's people at any opportunity in order to satisfy a giant national chip on one 's shoulder and the other is petty insults . 
  but i digress , i never intended to compare the two , i was just saying that you 're in a glass house when it comes to assuming someone of xenophobia . 
  i never said it was n't hateful , but , pot and kettle ... 
  in all seriousness , if scotland do leave , i hope we take the golden opportunity to officially rename the england & wales part of the union to britannia, 
  accusations of hatred are pretty rich coming from you mate . 
  oh god we 're europe 's scotland . 
  diet britain, 
  they 're not false , britain redirected its trade away from canada , australia and new zealand when it joined the eec , and those countries were forced to realign their trade to the us and china , it was seen by many in those countries as a betrayal on our part . 
  the intention behind those cultural links is the same as the eu , the entire project is intended to link countries with similar cultures , the uk has always felt a bit disconnected to the continent , and finds it difficult to find much common ground with eastern europeans . 
  if you think wanting closer ties with countries you share a lot of common ground with is imperialism , then surely the eu is an imperialist project ? 
  although you said it was the government , so i 'd like a few quotes from them on it , keeping in mind that wanting closer links with our kin is not imperial nostalgia , no one is talking about annexing india . 
  i 'd also like to clarify that an acknowledgment of difference or estrangement is not a form of hatred , and this decision was not one of europe vs anglosphere , it was more europe vs independence . 
  although if forced to pick , we 'd pick the latter in both cases , although that does n't mean we do n't want positive relations and cooperation with europe . 
  here are the strengths of [ russia ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=russia ) and the combined strength of europe 's five largest military powers , [ france ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=france ) , [ united kingdom ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=united-kingdom ) , [ germany ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=germany ) , [ italy ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=italy ) and [ poland ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=poland ) frontline personnel - rus : 766,000 ** eur : 970,000 ** reserves personnel - ** rus : 2,485,000 ** eur : 1,079,000 tanks - ** rus : 15,400 ** eur : 2,833 total aircraft - rus : 3,500 ** eur : 4,083 ** totaly navy - rus : 352 ** eur : 501 ** oil reserves - ** rus : 80 billion bbl ** eur : 4 billion bbl labour force - rus : 75,500,000 ** eur : 151,050,000 ** defence budget - rus : 46.6 billion usd ** eur : 169.6 billion ** ( the uk alone outranks russia in this area ) these numbers are likely imperfect and to save time i did n't do all other european nations and rounded numbers up and down a bit . 
  these numbers suggest russia would be able to hold out for a while if it was a defensive war , but a full invasion of europe is unthinkable , especially when you consider that the war would be fought in eastern europe and most of europe 's strength is concentrated in western europe , so production would be less affected for europe than it would in russia where a lot of the people and factories would be closer to the frontline . 
  russia would also likely be able to defeat any single european nation in a 1 on 1 war , although it would be at great cost and it 's unclear whether russia would be able to force unconditional surrender . 
  although in your scenario , considering these stats only combine 5 of europe 's 50 not-russia countries [ the outcome is clear . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ), 
   but not for the clique that 's running the country . 
  what examples do you have of the government showing empire nostalgia ? 
  i see no reason why the uk would n't let scotland leave , we were fully prepared to last time . 
  and frankly , a lot of us are tired enough of the snp , can only imagine what they 'd be like if we actually legitimized their `` poor oppressed nation '' routine . 
  pretty much every leave voter accepts it is bad in the short term, 
  i 'd add `` still recognisable in black and white '' as a rule of good flag design , which eliminates most tricolours . 
  a lot of them would help with a small symbol to make it unique , like canada 's flag . 
  well obviously , there 's only so many times you can see posts about how terrible leave voters/tory voters/ukip voters/old people/working class people are before you unsub . 
  [ only 15 % of no voters did so because of the eu ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/20/scottish-independence-lord-ashcroft-poll ) besides , the argument was one against scotland having to be outside of both the uk and eu , that was and remains an inevitable outcome of a yes vote . 
  lets wait for sturgeon to actually ask for it before we start assuming it will be blocked . 
  i got it slightly wrong , [ it only applies to attacks in europe or north america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_atlantic_treaty#article_5 ) so basically , only attacks to the homeland count . 
  there is a difference to being out alone and being out as part of the uk , britain is looking at damage from leaving and it 's a large economy , imagine what scotland could have faced . 
  of course , the difference is scotland would be seeking membership , although it is hard to say how long that interim could have dragged on . 
   a vote to leave the eu back in 2014 didnt even exist the snp felt differently : `` if we remain in the uk , the conservative party 's promise of an in/out referendum on eu membership raises the serious possibility that scotland will be forced to leave the eu against the wishes of the people of scotland '' page 80 of the white paper : http://www.gov.scot/resource/0043/00439021.pdf, 
   what you seemingly fail to understand si that nato works the exact same way ? 
  it does n't , nato only applies to attacks in the northern hemisphere and britain acted mostly alone in the war . 
  the argument was that a yes vote would guarantee scotland being out of both the uk and eu for a period of time , that remains true . 
  although that is not relevant to the fact that scotland chose to remain in a union and got a vote on the eu just like everyone else , while brexit is , potentially , an argument for independence , scotland knew this was a possibility when they voted to stay in the uk . 
  while that was probably the nicest rendition of gstq i 've ever heard , i still see it is a weak and rather emotionless national anthem for a country with a history as rich as ours , not to mention it 'll be even worse as `` god save the king '' . 
  so , i see your national anthem and raise you a song that is both [ anthemic and actually about the nation ] ( https://youtu.be/vpewpk_dl7m?t=7m56s ), 
  i think you have to actually ask for a referendum before it can be denied . 
  although the only talk i recall in terms of future referendums was the snp saying it was `` once in a generation '' , argue for indyref2 all you like , but do n't pretend the uk leaving the eu is somehow unfair . 
  two years ago you literally had a vote where you decided to take decisions with the rest of the uk , of which you are 8 % of the population . 
  you 're not going to be on the winning side every time , what was westminster supposed to do ? 
  that 's kinda irrelevant to my point . 
  it 's essential labour find a way to get rid of corbyn , but the party 's rules make it easy for his supporters to sign back up just to reelect him and he 's proven himself to not care at all about his mps by refusing to leave when asked , he cares more about turning the party into a far left protest group than a government . 
  farron is doing pretty good work though , although i see him as more of a `` rebuild the base '' leader than anything more . 
  not to mentionvoting system basically makes a prime minister who is n't labour or conservative impossible , conservative leadership until at least 2025 is almost certain . 
  jeremy corbyn is never going to be prime minister , he has the worst polling of any opposition leader ever . 
  even if he was n't completely incompetent and making his party hate him , he 's said so many things over his career as a backbench contrarian that will deliver an embarrassingly large conservative majority when printed on leaflets or repeated on political broadcasts . 
  you have no idea what the long term outcome of brexit will be . 
  our class divide is not because of our empire , many non-imperial nations have elitism and many non-elitist nations had empires . 
  only six hereditary peers have been created since 1965 and less than a hundred hereditary peers are still entitled to sit in the house , and those were internally elected . 
  i 'm not saying we 're not elitist and divided , but acting like the eu is some poor victim that is undeserving of criticism puts you on the same academic level as those who blame it for everything . 
  are you seriously trying to suggest that the british empire has more of an affect on the modern uk than the eu ? 
  it 's good to see that you 're not completely like them then , just switch `` xenophobes '' for `` classists '', 
  i guess there is nothing wrong with the eu and we 're all just a bunch of racists then . 
  also , the stories of the inevitable banking exodus are all stories of banks planning to open small eu bases , which , obviously , they have to . 
  i know , he 's a fun chap, 
  no only the mighty northern hermisphere may decide your culture, 
  i 'm the same , we 're a continent of beautiful and diverse cultures and while it 's great that we all get along i see no reason to try and merge us in to one national identity . 
  it might be a bit self centered of me but it feels like this kind of / r/yurop talk has been a lot more common here since the brexit vote .
