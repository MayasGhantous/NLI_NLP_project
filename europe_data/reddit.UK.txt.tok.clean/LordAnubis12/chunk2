  anything from # 100 to # 400 outside of london - this is just round the [ corner ] ( http://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/details/31281504?tmad=c&amp;tmcampid=35&amp;utm_campaign=rent-alert&amp;utm_content=contact-type-listing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=alert ) from me . 
  inside london , anything from # x to # x, 
  `` we speak better english than anywhere you 've been in france '' wins it for me ( no offense to the french ) . 
  or just carry on as if nothing was happening . 
  and when that fails , the stiff upper lip will sternly cease them in their tracks . 
  yea is my shop , thanks  cool , let me know if you do . 
  let me know which house she prefers and if she wears earrings i can send a pair of [ these ] ( https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/thehoneycombadam?section_id=13560873 ) across as well . 
  brighton , uk reporting in . 
  let me know if you want a * fabulous * card . 
  added note , does she watch game of thrones at all ? 
  i 'd love to see something like this for london where it 's just a clusterfuck of buildings, 
  eh , i do n't really want to get married , but i 'd like to have the option . 
  2-3 days , on average daily mail pick up times ... 
  this needs to be a map !, 
  `` which country do you dislike the most ? '', 
  i 'm sorry france . 
  as a gay guy going on holiday in a few weeks to croatia with my boyfriend , this certainly puts my mind at ease a bit , 
   [ on oecd \\ ( organisation for economic co-operation and development \\ ) figures , sweden has seen the biggest increase in inequality of any developed country over the past 25 years . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22650267 )  `` many said there was a wider context of a growing gap between rich and poor in sweden . '', 
   '' ... motive of the youths making trouble was anger over joblessness . '', 
  seems it 's a complex mixing pot of problems , similar to the london riots , than just an issue of immigration/integration . 
  we could do what we used to do and just invade . 
  things perhaps are n't that bad but certainly things are [ getting contentious between ukip/tories ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22592805 ) with the hard right tugging more and more at the more centrist leaders , with calls to abandon gay marriage bills amongst other things . 
  a slightly more clipped article than above from [ bbc ] : ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22592596 )  '' `` to britain , membership is estimated to be worth between # 31bn and # 92bn per year in income gains , or between # 1,200 to # 3,500 for every household . '', 
   '' `` we should push to strengthen and deepen the single market to include digital , energy , transport and telecoms , which could boost britain 's gdp by # 110bn . '', 
   `` the benefits of membership overwhelmingly outweigh the costs , and to suggest otherwise is putting politics before economics . '', 
  it 's very ... english ? 
  if that makes sense . 
  it 's quite a small , quiet town with lots of antiques shops and small local places . 
  chipping norton is lovely !, 
  not really . 
  i mean , it 's not all bad but nothing that great . 
  i think people underestimate how much people get stuck in their ways , especially in the modern age where moving and global connectivity is so easy . 
  for example , this subreddit . 
  close - warwickshire . 
  as far as we 're aware i 'm the first person to move outside of the county i was born in for ~ 200 years ( no records before about 1801 ), 
  clearly you 've never been to warwickshire , 
  on behalf of warwickshire , i 'm sorry . 
  brighton has a fairly big techy scene too with a bunch of small comapnies such as the company behind [ dear esther ] ( http://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/ ) and places like [ skiff ] ( http://theskiff.org/ ) and [ wired sussex ] ( http://www.wiredsussex.com/ ) giving it the name ` silicon beach ' . 
  sure , not many of these are hug or big players in the field , but is a very buzzy atmosphere . 
  true , though she had bigger balls than most male politicians since . 
  okay , i 'm not going to be doing much walking . 
  just lots of eating :p, 
  thanks for your help , 
  they 're really not . 
  i assure you !, 
  yea i know , was n't offended as per , just making a point ( maybe badly ! ), 
  i just had a look and a pizza at a restaurant is 25kn , which is about # 3 ? 
  is this true or am i making some sort of mistake ? 
  that 's another question actually . 
  we ca n't speak any other languages ( the downside of living in a native-english speaking country ) - will this be much of an issue or can most people speak basic english ? 
  will we come across as really rude ? 
  okay , will look at bus routes and stuff  yeah true . 
  as i say we should n't get huge amounts of attention , it 's more if we book a double room and things like that . 
  it sounds like just touring a lot of the area is the best plan  we 'll only be there for a few days though ( 4/5 ) . 
  not massively but it depends , i 'm up for one if it sounds interesting/is fairly relaxed  that sounds like a plan . 
  just everything in that area looks amazing . 
  i 'll discuss with the bf and see what we think . 
  flights currently look cheapest to zagreb . 
  what are food/drink prices like in the area ? 
  awesome , thanks for this !, 
  might be that we fly into zagreb so will check it out . 
  yea , i have a close friend here who 's from austria so might plan with her what is best to do , 
  awesome !, 
  check out / r/brighton - we have a very active facebook page with events all the time . 
  there 's one for tomorrow if you 're interested , 
  uhh , wine , food , walking and generally exploring old towns and beaches and stuff . 
  i want quite a quiet holiday so nothing too wild . 
  ideally moving from restaurant to beach to restaurant ... 
  i was looking at going to split but will change plans now . 
  maybe a flight to zagreb then a train to the coast ? 
  i would , but i want sunshine and good food . 
  ahh awesome . 
  i might look into that , though not sure i 'll be able to as i 'm under 21 . 
  thanks , was looking at going to split so will plan otherwise now !, 
  awesome , thanks . 
  when you say hiking , how involved is that ? 
  is it really hard walking and rough terrain , or more just walking in the hills ? 
  it 's not like that i do n't think . 
  in brighton there are a lot of restaurants that just have a rainbow flag on the door , it 's more a sign of it being a friendly space and that same sex couples are welcome without judgement . 
  either that or maybe they just sell [ this stuff ] ( http://www.joecrazy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/penis-pasta.jpg ) . 
  i will when you stop doing straight stuff in public . 
  awesome , thanks for that  i just picked a random country , please do n't feel i was attacking estonia in anyway . 
  i 'll try and resist the urge to skip , though sometimes it is hard . 
  it 's just a more fun way lf walking , 
  and if not then there 's always [ help ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_p0azlnqvn9o/tiqtmdu-5ai/aaaaaaaaafo/6aqjx5nqaxg/s1600/pbf024adunicorn.jpg ) at hand . 
  i 'm not really interested in clubbing etc , so just good food , sights and weather , and not having to work is all i want !, 
  mostly just chilling out and escaping for a bit . 
  nothing too much effort , just sight seeing , nice weather and cheap food :p germany/austria is certainly on my want to go to list . 
  hopefully one day ... 
  that 's the issue with coming from brighton where it 's so tolerant of everything . 
  there was an edl ( far right group ) march here a few months back . 
  4 of the them turned up to a group of a few thousand angry hippies . 
  i was looking at hvar as it seems to get good reviews on travel sites . 
  we 're on a tight budget too , so any recommendations for cheap spots would be much appreciated . 
  we might end up couch surfing it we can and people are happy with couples . 
  any recommendations for things to see/visit ? 
  i know so little of croatia which is why i want to go there . 
  yea , is one i was looking at this morning  as well as brno as it looks quite interesting and cheap . 
  will take a look , thanks  .
