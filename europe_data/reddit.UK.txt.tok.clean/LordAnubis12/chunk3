  we 're not interested really in bars/clubs , it 's more just the safe feeling of not being stared at that we want . 
  i am thinking berlin , wanted to go there for a while and people have said great things . 
  plus it 's not too far so easy to get to and i can speak a tiny amount of german . 
  mm , it 's probably not as bad as i make it out . 
  it 's more i 'd just like to go there and not have to worry about what we do too much and can just relax and enjoy being there , not worrying about the looks we get etc. 
  we could probably pass as just good friends travelling in hotels or restaurants , it 's the consciously avoiding hold hands or little things like that would give us away . 
  i 'm hoping that cities will be mostly young students as that should help with the no-one caring thing . 
  yeah , i 'm thinking scandinavia now but wanted somewhere warm . 
  dammit !, 
  we went to amsterdam last year which was nice and did n't feel that much different to here . 
  i think the difficult thing is that we live in brighton currently which has a massive gay scene and everything is really accepted . 
  so even going to some places here i 'm a bit wary . 
  i think it 's not so much about risk , as it is about response . 
  so while yes , i could be beaten up in germany , it 's more likely to be taken seriously than it would be in another country such as estonia , where it might just be dismissed . 
  thanks for that . 
  it 's nice to see croatia in the top there , was worried after reading the other article as i 'd imagine it to be fairly accepting . 
  me and the bf are n't exactly stereotypical or going to be attracting attention so hopefully it 'll be fine . 
  any ideas for southern/eastern europe are like ? 
  linked simply as `` welcome to europe . '', 
  hopefully this wo n't lead to bullying from the us . 
  eu has been reasonably good recently in standing up against things such as the general electric/honeywell merger in 2005 . 
  it depends really , only in restaurants for me and even then it depends on service/where it is . 
  if there 's a 12.5 % service charge i 'll usually accept it or if it 's a nice local place then i 'll tip , but for anything else very rarely . 
  i think this is the important factor :  ... anti-european sentiment within the british population appears to be diminishing , especially among 18 to 34 year old , a new poll has found . 
   the survey ... found that two-thirds of brits ** within that age group ** would vote in favor of their country remaining in the eu if it were put up to a vote in a referendum . 
  the reverse held true for those over the ** age of 60 ** , a segment of the population in which two-thirds believe the country should leave the european political bloc . 
  also , i am always wary of poll results no matter what the result , as demonstrated by [ this clip . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0zzjxw4mta ), 
  it 's fairly sensible that europe does n't really need to invest in hard power while usa is around and more than happy to help in that regard . 
  however , where europe 's strengths lie is in soft power . 
  really glad there was annotations on that , i 'd have had difficulty picking them apart otherwise !, 
  seriously though , the drawing is amazing and pretty damn accurate ... 
  aaaand suddenly i really really want to go to serbia . 
  have been planning to/thinking about it , now it 's much more certain . 
  i think `` wants '' and `` suggests we should actually do '' are two different things , and people who are slightly scared that there might actually be a left-ist voter base in the uk are rushing to find anything he said and throw it up as him declaring it a serious policy . 
  i 'm not saying that he 's not a bit far-fetched in some cases , but it does seem like there 's a lot if over-simplification and assumptions being made as a knee-jerk reaction from the right . 
  [ for example ] ( https://i.imgur.com/uzldeup.jpg ), 
  hello incas, 
  it 's also interesting the amount of money that was given to the slave owners by the government as reparations for their lost labour . 
  i think the de-slavery situation has been rather cheery picked ( unsurprisingly ) over the centuries ... http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britains-colonial-shame-slaveowners-given-huge-payouts-after-abolition-8508358.html [ estimates place the amount paid out to private individuals between 16 to # 76 billion in todays money ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21587236-pressure-grows-compensation-caribbean-trade-blood-money ), 
  i think the main issue is that you seem to be heavily implying each refugee is a potential terrorist , while also ignoring the reason that they are refugees in the first place is due to disruption in the middle east * due * to terrorists . 
  put him a bucket of weetabix and then let it dry . 
  that fucker is n't going anywhere . 
  thanks !, 
  i cocked up the link anyway so no great loss , 
  the submission thing was being weird when i tried to submit , did n't check . 
  well , there goes my attempt at a well timed karma run . 
  hopefully not !, 
  caroline lucas did turn up at the front door the other day , which was a bit of a shock but she 's the only mp i 've actually seen out and about . 
  voted green , naturally . 
  even if you ignore all of the other policies , we need a decent environmental policy otherwise we 're fucked anyway . 
  the article mentions more specifically the highlands - which are in scotland and far far more remote than say , the lake district . 
  swans are the real danger here in the uk . 
  graceful embodiments of pure evil . 
  not necessarily experts , but id trust people in the commons and lords to discuss and debate on the uk exiting the eu more than a random person working in a super market . 
  not as expert as i 'd like but still ... 
  no it 's not , that 's why we have representatives that are experts rather than just having everyone voting in everything . . 
  just because something is popular , does not mean it is correct , or the best choice . 
  hah , thanks for your honesty . 
  i did layer on the sarcasm with a trowel i admit . 
  yeah but that 's not what the reddit concensus is !, 
  listen to these random people , dammit . 
  and interestingly about 30 years old now ... 
  and finally work on the jaeger program can begin . 
  also ... http://www.twisteddoodles.com/image/112638398692, 
   the failures of states to provide their people with resources , protection and legitimate authority leaves space for non-state actors to gain legitimacy -- especially if , like isis , they provide welfare , services and some semblance of order , even if justice is summary and brutal . 
  the need for resources also blurs the line between some of the non-state political actors and criminal networks . 
   the involvement of europeans in isis indicates the difficulty of containing the ideas of isis within national or regional boundaries . 
  efforts to combat it likewise need to be international . 
  but european governments need to avoid simply allying with every mena government that styles itself as a force against terrorism . 
  this is a bandwagon that virtually every state is jumping on , whether syria or egypt , saudi arabia or iran , and even non-state actors like hezbollah , hamas and the muslim brotherhood . 
   instead , the need is more difficult , and more complex , but more likely to be successful : to envisage a new approach to ** security that focuses on the security of citizens ** more than of governments , whether they are in europe or in the middle east . 
  an ex colony of france is attacked by terrorists , and has gign troops deployed , but is not on topic ? 
  i am a little confused ... 
  i would like to see this also represented as a % of the total yearly deaths by other non natural means . 
  put things into a bit of context for policy making . 
  the greatest unicorn of them all, 
  may have spoken too soon :[ nsfw/l ] ( https://twitter.com/nidalgazaui/status/666024187669123072 ), 
  as well as ` refugees ' who are fleeing syria for reasons not too far from the above . 
  just closing borders to immigration is n't going to change or help anything , and is very short sighted . 
  and the reason they are leaving syria is not germany 's fault . 
  it did not create the syrian civil war . 
  well , considering libyan intervention has been tied to fueling the rise of isis and the refugee crisis , then it kind of is the alternative ... 
  against who though ? 
  isis is a very de-structed and fairly weak ( in terms of infrastructure ) , so the typical state vs state warfare is n't going to work . 
  plus , bombing and destabilising countries is what caused isis to become so powerful and want to attack the west in the first place . 
  more like 99.9 % . 
  terror attacks are extremely rare statistically . 
  plus the knee jerk reaction to increase bombing against is targets and generally not try to understand why this is happening in the first place is extremely distressing . 
   and follow it up by welcoming in millions of uneducated migrants . 
  not all are uneducated 2 . 
  migrants are needed to shore up job market and the problems of pensions and declining pensions . 
  over 80 now ... 
  its okay . 
  we just call sweden denmark instead , makes everything easier . 
  because cornwall would be very upset ? 
  thanks for the detailed reply . 
  while i mostly agree with you i think , the question is more what do we do with those that have made it here ? 
  simply ` sending them all back ' to syria et al is n't going to solve the problem - just moves it . 
  personally i 'd like to see a structured acceptance of them , but make it strict as you say , and provide a lot of support in terms of education of the culture they 're migrating into , and ensure it 's not just a case of dropping a bunch of migrants into a single town/city/area and have a single community created around it .
