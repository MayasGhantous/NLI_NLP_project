  [ almost every accepted map of europe ? ... 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=17gzh1ozcvrfaaab0bhbjeljnrl4&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=45.95114985546978%2c7.2290036250000185&amp;z=3 ), 
  look , scream all you want about it , turkey is technically recognized as part of europe - and i 'm sure that turks have plenty of interesting insight on the question as well ... 
  we \u00b4 ll start a referendum campaign . 
  i think you 're generalizing somewhat , see fig 1a me : - is a lefty ( i.e member of the labour party and voter for the psoe ) - is patriotic to the uk - thinks free-speech is the cornerstone of society, 
  howcome ? 
  - that 's sounds awfully reminiscent of things said by francisco franco or benito mussolini ... 
  i 'd conflate my ` europeanism ' with my regional , personal and national identity - so sort of . 
  the main reason is due to the fact that i have pretty strong ties with spain and feel culturally linked to other parts of the continent - in the way that i lack that link with parts of asia ( as an example ) . 
  being a patriot is about loving your own country - not trying to force other people to as well ... 
  they 're allowed their own beliefs , the same way you are - so maybe re-consider your position ... 
  you all seem to have either : - a boat - a summer house - a sauna - social anxiety - a complete lack of shame about your bodies - a language i still ca n't speak - alcoholism and potentially : all of the above, 
  you must drink copious amounts of alcohol in that case ? 
  - that 's certainly the only way i 'd survive without tea or coffee in my life ... 
  i 'll be honest - i wish the lines were less blurred - i 'd like to see politics relegated to / r/ukpolitics and / r/britishpolitics , with / r/england , / r/wales , / r/scotland and / r/unitedkingdom being a little bit more like / r/london . 
  only with friends following the eu referendum - and it was n't a very serious conversation . 
  as / u/eris-x said , there is no real ` drive ' for any sort of pan-celtic union , because , quite frankly , many celtic peoples do n't really feel united with each other , hence it has never become a topic of debate in mainstream politics . 
  to put it simply , if you asked an irishman or a welshman if they 'd consider themselves a celt , they 'd likely look at you funny and ask whether you 'd been reading too many history books . 
  my personal favorite story had to be from a friend who came to spain a couple of years back . 
  when they arrived at a restaurant , they were given the option of a beef dish or a pork dish , naturally they turned both down , saying that they were vegetarian . 
  the waiter responded to them - ` so , i suppose you 'll be having the chicken then ? ', 
  and promptly left . 
  well , the south yorkshire force here in sheffield has got a lot better . 
  ( that 's compared to the 80s and 90s mind you ) the officers themselves are like any other police in the uk in my experience - it 's just the upper ranks and the way that they are organised which is the issue . 
  for most , [ plenty of acceptance and tolerance . 
  ] ( https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=oip.mbf4c30073941171dbfd841b3b38ded43h0&amp;pid=api ) for others - [ less so . 
  ] ( https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=oip.mc480910163a0ace59cda9f5e87532e71h0&amp;pid=api ) generally , those who actually know muslims already live here have no quarrel with muslim immigrants in the uk , and treat them no differently to any other brit - it 's those whose only experience with muslims has been the right wing tabloid media who are the least accepting . 
  my impression is that you 're definitely not - most of the people i 've known/i know from scandanavia ( swedes , fins and icelanders at least ) have confirmed almost immediately that it is a very common thing to have no regard for clothing the minute the temperature heats up - and are almost never dressed when at home . 
  in the meanwhile , in scandinavia ... 
  it 's definitely tastier - i 've always preferred brown breads to white ones personally .

  well , it 's become a national tradition here in the uk to make outdated jokes about the french surrendering and being dirty . 
  ^ ^ disclaimer : ^ ^ we ^ ^ love ^ ^ you ^ ^ really ^ ^ france a couple of classics ( which i admit are really overused ) include :  `` why do n't they have fireworks at euro disney ? '', 
  `` because every time they fire them off , the french try to surrender ''  `` how do you sink a french battleship '' `` put it in water ''  `` where 's the best place to hide your money '' `` under a french-man 's soap ''  what colours do the british army fly ? 
  red , white and blue  what colours do the us army fly ? 
  red , white and blue  what colour does the french army fly ? 
  white . 
  to be honest , most of us do too ... 
  when the best selling newspaper in the uk needs to withdraw it 's frontpage due to lack of factual accuracy , it 's ridiculous . 
  as for the football team , my personal favourites have to be :  `` osama bin laden recently released a video claiming to still be alive . 
  in the video he is uses the fact that the english football team was recently beaten in an international sporting event ''  `` british intelligence have rejected the footage , as it could have been filmed any time in the last 50 years . . '' or  `` what 's the difference between england and an albatross ? '', 
   `` an albatross has got two decent wings . '', 
  do n't get completely hammered in public and respect the locals ... 
  i live 3 months a year in spain ( more specifically , the canary islands ) . 
  often enough on an evening , you 'll see tourists ( guiris ) charging around , shouting abuse at local families who are out for a meal , or complaining about how these ` dirty spaniards are getting in our way ' . 
  if you 're going to come here , you need to understand , it 's normal for children to be out with their parents late at night - and therefore , if you want to fuck around - go to a club . 
  i 've got plenty of time for tourists who can hold their drink and stay civil , but those who charge around pissed-out of their brains with kids around can shit off ... 
  i do n't think there is any popular demand for it . 
  most gun users in the uk go through a long process to get 'em and we do n't really have a problem with gun crime , hence restriction would just push the weapons trade entirely into the black market - it 's not necessary . 
  i 'd certainly consider myself european , probably more-so than english or welsh . 
  however , i am a biased sample on account of having vested interests in spain ... 
  so far , i 've seen a bunch of videos on / r/publicfreakout and almost no news reporting relating to it ( i think there was one article in the guardian online ) . 
  as i understand , it 's related to controversial labour reforms and has led to protests being infiltrated by anarchists who have been attacking under-prepared riot police . 
  what i 've found from being in spain is that ( and i 'm assuming a similar thing stands in italy ? 
  ) : opinions on cats especially are often a lot more polarized , some people see cats as nothing more than street vermin , whilst for others they are part of the family . 
  are you absolutely sure you are n't a dutch dog ? ... 
  right , most households here in the uk have some sort of pet , they 're relatively common . 
  roughly 14 % of households have a fish ( or multiple fish ) 24 % of households have a dog , 18 % have a cat and around 3 % have a rabbit . 
  as for names the most popular were : male dog : 1 . 
  max 4 . 
  barney 8 . 
  toby 9 . 
  jack 10 . 
  buddy female dog : 1 .

  willow, 
  from my experience of glasgow , usually in the street just left there by some tramp ... 
  right , in terms of birmingham , manchester and bradford , all are quite large cities , the suggestion that they are completely unsafe is absolutely ludicrous . 
  i 'd feel safe walking around any of the mentioned at most points , they are hardly ` no-go ' areas . 
  there are areas , as is the case with any city , which i 'd personally avoid at around 2am , but that does n't mean that i genuinely think something would happen , but rather that i 'd prefer to avoid that risk . 
  a resource which is useful is http://www.police.uk/ which gives crime maps for areas , so you can check out where is safer . 
  what if you fall into both categories ? ... 
   tfw when you were born in oxford , raised in south wales and live in yorkshire ... 
  here in the canary islands , spain , all are at half mast outside the hotels at least . 
  their national flower is also the thistle , it represents the welcoming and friendly relationship they have always had with the english ... 
  we would assume that the uk 's seats in the parliament would be withdrawn , hence many ukip meps would lose their jobs . 
  as for ukip itself , it would likely continue campaigning in the uk on other major issues such as cutting immigration and government reform . 
  depends , i have a friend who was brought up in chicago , as soon as he lost the accent you 'd never know he was american , i would n't say he 's any less british than one of us tbh , perhaps it 's different in other countries ?
