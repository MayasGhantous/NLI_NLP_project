  have you ever read a history book ? 
  spain had the coup in 1936 ~ ~ after ~ ~ when the 2nd republic collapsed . 
  the country is in no mood to go back to dictatorship as i understand it ... 
  you 're telling me . 
  we invented the goddam things !, 
  god forbid if the channel was n't there and we had to share a border with ... 
  the french ... 
  in what way ? 
  is n't the perfect justification for why we would want to work towards leveling out that playing field ? 
  - i 'm not saying it 's something which will just be imposed overnight , but surely a standard wage across the eu is vital if we are going to make sure that some countries do n't experience a drain of workers whilst others see huge influxes ? 
  well , we know for a fact that the only forces who use su-24 model fighters ( http://www.airvectors.net/avsu24_5.png ) are : - algeria : too far away , out of the question . 
  - iran : too far away , out of the question . 
  - kazakhstan : too far away , out of the question . 
  - syria : too far away , out of the question . 
  - sudan : too far away , out of the question . 
  - ukraine : too far away , out of the question and russia : within range and have been known to do it before ... 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb here and say ( assuming these are su-24 fighters ) they will likely be from either : - the 98th reconnaissance aviation regiment hosted at the 6964th aviation base at monchegorsk airbase in murmansk or - the 7000th guard regiment hosted at voronezh malshevo in voronezh . 
  or - the 4th independent naval assault aviation regiment ( part of the russian baltic fleet ) hosted at the 7045th air base at chemyakhovsk air base in kaliningrad . 
  pretty much , it 's a bloody good guess , but if these are su-24 fencers , they are russian ... 
  my friend , if you only saw the state of flood debates and pmqs in the uk , you 'd be applauding this gentleman for not making donkey noises and guffawing while he made the hand gesture ... ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ not ^ ^ condoning ^ ^ this , ^ ^ just ^ ^ saying , ^ ^ in ^ ^ comparison ^ ^ to ^ ^ widely ^ ^ televised ^ ^ uk ^ ^ parliament ^ ^ debates , ^ ^ this ^ ^ is ^ ^ nothing, 
  just remember , the turnout levels at eu elections in the uk are ridiculously low , so what our meps do and say do n't necessarily represent the thoughts of more than something like 10 % of the population .

  well no , but the point i was trying to make was that , in essence , the core members of the eu are less likely to want to quit because ultimately their goal as part of the eu is to ultimately unite and create a ` federal states of europe ' . 
  it 's not due to party name as much as it is party ideology in essence . 
  ( the reason i chose the pp is because they have relatively similar policies to the moderates and also both have adopted names to suggest that they are more centrist - when in fact they fit the characteristics of centre-right conservative parties ), 
  the thing about the eu , is that it is n't necessarily a club , as much as it is the framework for federalization , hence it seems unlikely that the nations who are focused on that goal ( especially france , italy and germany ) are likely to leave the organisation . 
  can someone provide a translation ? 
  i could n't agree more , for example : recently , at the school i 've been working at as an assistant teacher , we had kids playing `` ebola '' where-in they run around essentially playing tag , but screaming rather `` you 've got ebola , you 're dead now '' . 
  they 're kids , they do n't understand the gravity of the situation , it 's not because they genuinely aspire to give people ebola or carry out beheadings - it 's something they pick up from the media and imitate . 
  they are technically the equivalent of spain 's conservative pp ( partido popular ) in this aspect . 
  they call themselves the moderates to try and fit in with the other centrist parties in the blue bloc , but as i understand it , they are the most right wing in sweden bar the swedish democrats . 
  to be honest , i fail to be really persuaded by either campaign , if it were n't for my vested interest in the eu , i would likely be completely indifferent . 
  so far , i 've seen nothing but scaremongering related to immigration from the out campaign and scaremongering related to jobs from the in campaign ... 
  i love the way in stating that i will `` i 'm sure you will cherry pick a sentence or two though . '', 
  you have done the exact same thing ... 
  please note , even in their biased report , migrationwatchuk concedes that the amended report which they cite still concludes : - immigrants from the eea had overall made a positive fiscal contribution - the contribution of recent immigrants ( i.e. 
  those that arrived since 2000 ) was positive with recent immigrants from the a10 countries of eastern europe making a positive contribution of # 5 billion while those from the eu15 made a contribution of # 15 billion - in contrast british born ( ` natives ' ) were found to have cost nearly # 600 billion over the same period . 
  the migrationwatch report then proceeds to cite the figure '' # 148 bn '' without any evidence to prove where this came from and fails to take into consideration the economic growth ( jn gdp ) which migration assists with - which is highlighted in the migration observatory report which i posted before ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/fiscal-impact-immigration-uk and in the ucl report : https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-eu-immigration ) cream , the group who migrationwatchuk source their information from stated in relation to this report : * cream has strenuously dismissed the migration watch use of their data , insisting the think tank 's work is `` based on a serious misinterpretation of the methodology we have used in our work , which leads to fundamental mistakes that invalidate their calculations '' . 
  ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/03/13/immigrants-cost-uk_n_4954341.html ) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- also , please note , the source migrationwatchuk has been called out on multiple occasions as being highly inaccurate or misleading : `` critics have accused green 's migrationwatch uk of failing to be impartial and statistically accurate on the issue of immigration since it was founded by the former ambassador to saudi arabia and syria in 2001 . '', 
  ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/21/david-cameron-ukip-desperation-migrationwatch-uk-founder-peerage ) their previous miscalculations also come to mind ... `` a predicted flood of romanian and bulgarian migrants coming to britain after border controls were lifted in january has failed to materialise - with actually 4,000 fewer now working in the uk . '', 
  - `` the figures fly in the face of predictions such as those by migration watch , which suggested 50,000 more romanians and bulgarians would head to britain every year after the restrictions were lifted . 
  the number has in fact fallen . '', 
  ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21039087 - http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/14/romania-bulgaria-immigrat_n_5321387.html ) ** we 'll try again shall we ? 
  do you have a * viable * source which suggests the eu migrants are a burden on the uk fiscally speaking ? 
  do you have any evidence to the contrary ? 
  - which suggests that eu migrants will be a liability economically speaking ? 
  i can give you the oxford observatory report if you 'd prefer that ? 
  it concludes that migration from the eea and eu have a net benefit in terms of uk gdp and will also help to keep down debt levels as a % of gdp : http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/fiscal-impact-immigration-uk, 
  it is exactly the same with a lyric change , helps us remember the glorious heritage of the motherland !, 
  which un figure are you quoting ? 
  my source ( http://votes-for-expat-brits.com/documents/ippr_globalbrittextforprint.pdf ) suggested 2.20 million in 2010 , hence that was the figure i used - it will likely now be higher i assume ? 
  as for eu nationals , who do not hold a british citizenship , the figure i found as 2.94 , although you are correct in stating 3.3 million currently live in the uk who were born in the eu ( some 400,000 gained british citizenship ) . 
  you refer to the point that eu migrants are not `` net contributor `` s to the uk governmental system , how do you respond to the financial times ' claim that they pay in # 20 billion ?

  do you know what is also lame ? 
  your freedom of speech , now , of to gulag you go ... 
  it 's almost as if the style was taken from / r/russia, 
  the current eu national population in the uk is 2.94 mn ( as of 2014 - http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migration-flows-a8-and-other-eu-migrants-and-uk ) , the uk national population in the eu was estimated at 2.20 mn in 2010 ( http://votes-for-expat-brits.com/documents/ippr_globalbrittextforprint.pdf ) the numbers in this aspect are of course estimates , however all the same , they show that uk citizen emigration is not much lower than eu migrant immigration . 
  however , the eu migrant population in the uk has a higher employment rate than uk migrants in the eu , ( http://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/key-characteristics-of-eu-migrant-citizens-in-the-uk-and-northwest-england/ ) with 79.4 % of eu migrants within the uk being employed whilst only 73.5 % of uk citizens in the eu are unemployed . 
  quite simply put : eu migrants benefit the uk more than uk emigrants benefit the eu . 
  we may need some help with that , can you send some more people over ? 
  although saying that , the added population may annoy / u/breadth _ first ... 
  what is this april fools you talk of ? 
  comrade , such talk will have you put into gulag ... 
  did we just get annexed ? ... 
  revealed : more than 1.26 million migrants from britain have moved to live in the rest of the eu ... 
  something which needs to be understood all over the world : ** you ca n't stop abortions , what you can do is stop * safe legal * abortions ... **,

  europe : ` donald trump rallies are not safe places ', 
  correct , but their perceptions are what dictate their opinions , not facts and figures . 
  i 'll use the experience of a friend of mine who lives in hackney , london : `` when i was born , this area used to be entirely white working class , there were pubs and general stores on the street corners '' - `` nowadays , all of that is gone , they have been replaced by halal stores and pakistani food markets , that 's fine , but it 's different , and people around here do n't like different . 
  they are n't racist , but they are afraid that they are losing their culture and the area they grew up in . 
  they associate their narrow perception with the ` islamification of the uk ' and have that prejudice confirmed by the media '' - `` that 's where the ukip voters come from , it 's badly educated people , afraid of change , who do n't see the big picture not people who are racists '' that was 60 year old resident of the hackney council estate , who i met up in the peak district 's view of the situation . 
  for france : `` conservative think-tank institut montaigne estimated that there were 60 million ( 85 % ) white people of european origin , 6 million ( 10 % ) north african people , 2 million ( 3.5 % ) black people and 1 million ( 1.5 % ) people of asian origin in metropolitan france , including all generations of immigrant descendants .

  that 's a very fair point to make , it ultimately comes down to a good bit of media scaremongering ... 
  i would n't necessarily say so , it 's a segment of the left wing of politics which whilst claiming to push for progressive policies , in truth calls for societal regression ( we are talking the type usually seen in cultural conservatism ) . 
  it 's a recognised political term , although has very negative connotations . 
  i do n't see how it is effective to see a group of people and take those who are vocal as representative of the majority , whether those be protesters or muslims , we should n't take the actions of a minority as representative of a majority . 
  well technically speaking stalin was ` wise ' ( he 's documented to have been an incredible thinker and politician - you only have to look at the way he manipulated members of the party and reached his position ) , in that way the statement is semi-correct . 
  however , he was also incredibly paranoid and de-sensitised person , hence why he felt no remorse despite carrying out atrocities . 
  ideally , the whole world should be nuke free . 
  however , in practice , not right now ... 
  well , the bbc removed the title , however at the same time there were reports of nazi salutes , so interpret it as you will ... 
  i 'd imagine it 's a mainly peaceful protest with some ultra-right elements slipping into the crowd . 
  no hard feelings ? 
  that much i do agree with , the usa should n't feel obliged to act as the `` world police '', 
  just remember , unemployment rates in spain are very deceptive , as most people work in informal sectors , there are loads of jobs here , but the culture ever since the 50s has been one of an informal economy . 
  slight issue , the us is one of the founding members of nato , hence you are bound to help defend your european partners as an extension of that . . 
  he 's sorry , he 's sorry , he 's so so sorry , there 's no easy way to say it , he 's sorry ... 
  i 'd follow up on that , but be careful not to tar all immigrants together : i was a teaching assistant in a y7 ( 10-11 year old ) history class for 2 years ( 2014-16 ) and as much as i wish it was just a stereotype , it quickly became evident that the most disruptive children in the class were young male immigrants , mainly from yemen , pakistan and somalia . 
  however , some of the most attentive and highest achieving and most inquisitive children were female immigrants from the same places ... 
  the issue comes down to culture , young males from the middle east and east africa are generally taught from a young age , that they are dominant and have the right to act however they please , on the other hand , girls are told that they are to conform . 
  this is not necessarily linked to religion ( the most disruptive in the class were muslims , christians and atheists ) but rather due to the conservative cultures of the nations they hailed from . 
  tl ; dr young immigrant boys are the most disruptive , whilst young immigrant girls are some of the most attentive . 
  * ( please do n't call me racist , i 'm just trying to express my personal experience ) *, 
  i did n't know that politicians were allowed that close to children 's playgrounds since the grooming scandals ... 
  did anyone else read this as `` musings of an american * bullfighter * in ukraine ? ...
