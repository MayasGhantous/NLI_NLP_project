  does anyone have access to get past the pay-block ? 
  if the british weather and traffic were n't so bad , we 'd be less sociable than sober swedes at a bus stop ... 
  they are the only things we are able to talk about ... 
  i 'll say this , having grown up in the uk , i can tell you , yes , we do things differently , however the so called ` cultural gap ' between the uk and other north-western european countries really is n't evident to me . 
  i could easily go to a country like the netherlands and find that the only difference is that street signs are a different colour and have more languages on them . 
  yes , there are differences between us historically and culturally , however compared some culture shocks i 've experienced going to places in the usa , there is n't as big a gap as you may think . 
  i would say anti-semetism most certainly has been an issue in the uk , i 'm not sure if you remember , but in the 1930s , a british tabloid called the mail supported nazi anti-semetic policy and encouraged boycotts against jews in the uk . 
  as well as this , in the pre-1800s period , anti-semetism was widespread , especially in protestant communities . 
  also , since when , may i inquire , has discrimination against groups been something associated with dna ? ... 
  i 'm afraid to say , that anti-semetism is a problem in the uk as much as the rest of europe and always has been ... 
  - stop * ping * relationships with french colonies '' - the renegotiation of all economic relationships with former colonies '' '' - a toughening of the requirements to get french citizenship '' '' - banning dual nationality for non-europeans , which would particularly affect citizens of former french colonies in africa .

  if you wo n't listen to me , listen to france 24 , who back up what i 've said : http://www.france24.com/en/20140528-france-national-front-policy-eu/, 
  i apologies for my french , but going through it , those were the policies i noted which i disagreed with , which was what he 'd asked for ... 
  because the point is that , unless you are born in europe , you will be denied the ability to have a dual french citizenship ... to me that seems discriminatory , for example , what if a canadian from quebec ( with similar cultural ties to france ) wanted a citizenship , yet fn policy would likely deny this ... 
  it 's also discrimination against the previous french empire in my opinion , it would be the equivalent of the uk telling the citizens of new zealand that they could not hold a dual british citizenship . 
  what about banning any non-europeans from holding french dual-citizenship ? 
  that is arguably discrimination purely based on birthplace ... 
  the muslim population of the uk in 1970 was 1.25 million [ 1 ] the current muslim population of the uk is around 2.75 million . 
  the projected muslim population of the uk in 2039 is unknown but on the current trend i 'd expected to be around 3.5 million ( out of a projected total 74 million people in the uk ) - i.e it will still remain near negligible minority ... what do i think will happen as that number rises up ? 
  i would expect us to follow a similar trend to that of history ; i.e by the 3rd or 4th generation , immigrants will likely act less like ` immigrants ' and more like brits as they move up the socio-economic ladder . 
  quite simply put , i expect those generations to be less likely to be the purveyors of crimes ... 
  the issue which you pin to islam and immigration is more to do with culture and socio-economics : i.e immigrants are generally poorer , hence live in areas which are less wealthy and due to this are more likely to become involved in crime ... as i 'll always maintain , this is less linked to the religion , it 's the socio-economics which are the more important factor . 
  - it 's the same reason that in the usa , african americans are more likely to be involved in criminality , as they live in poorer areas , yet you 'd never blame that on their race ... [ 1 ] http://www.ijesd.org/papers/29-d438.pdf just to be clear , that 's not saying there is n't a cultural problem with islam today , nor do i agree that open borders are the correct policy to follow ... 
  however , i think the fn approach is rash and under considered ... 
  what exactly does this have to do with russia ? 
  other than the fact that it 's from rt ? 
  well , muslims and people from north african/middle eastern backgrounds represent 7.5 % of the french population [ 1 ] , so it seems unlikely that they will suddenly completely over-weigh the french local population . 
  as for cutting immigration to 10,000 , it would have adverse affects on the national demographics of france , a country already burdened with a growing aging population ( which even it 's pro-natalist policy is failing to combat ) , i do n't believe it 's a viable policy at all ... 
  lowering the level i agree with , but not so extensively ... as for giving tax breaks to the middle classes , i never mentioned that for a reason , i do n't think it is a bad thing , what worries me is the fact that in bringing down the tax threshold ( down to 46 % ) [ 2 ] , fn will in turn give massive tax-breaks to the super rich , who i believe should be contributing more considering the gains they have made following the 2008 economic disaster .

  things which come to my mind include : * overturning of laws on gay marriage and adoption * banning any non-europeans holding french dual-citizenship : i.e discrimination against the previous french empire . 
  * stopping relationships with french colonies * leaving the eu , even though it benefits france * massive cutback on legal immigration to a maximum 10,000 a year * giving tax breaks to high earners and lowering the tax celing for the extremely wealthy . 
  * acting directly against the eu 's free trade ethos ( sourced from the manifesto document http://www.frontnational.com/le-projet-de-marine-le-pen/ ) as someone who would call themself more socially liberal and an internationalist , i do n't think that the fn 's proposed actions in many areas would benefit france in any way , hence why i fundamentally disagree with their national conservative ideology . 
  generally , for want of a better way to say it , large scale immigration happened without a enough integration and the education system slumped , all of this created a perfect storm for the country to have serious issues . 
  agreed , personally , i detest the ideology of the fn , however , i would still fight to ensure that they were allowed to express their opinion about it , as long as they do so in a non-violent way . 
  bloody eu regulations telling us we ca n't destroy our environment , put toxins in our foods and deny our citizens their human rights , we 'll be glad to be rid of them i 'll recon !, 
  after all , all the uk really needs is a good ol' `` long term economic plan '' which involves crippling our services and making people impoverished !, 
  ( / s for those who are n't as cynical as us brits ), 
  you really do have no love for russia do you ? ... 
  the fins are the only people who i 've met who are more anti-social than swedes on weekdays and londoners on the tube ... 
  in that it is possible to argue : a ) israel is a construct of us/uk foreign policy following the 1950s and hence is acting as a puppet state . 
  b ) israel is a construct of us/uk foreign policy following the 1950s and now acts by itself but still follows the lines of the west 's policy . 
  c ) israel is a construct of us/uk foreign policy following the 1950s and now defines uk/us foreign policy in the middle east , it 's actions are mimicked by the west . 
  d ) israel is a construct of us/uk foregin policy following the 1950s and acts as by itself with the west 's support , yet does n't always follow it 's guideline , it does what it wants without accountability . 
  it depends on how powerful you count israel as , personally , my opinion is somewhere between b and d it could be viably argued any way . 
  to be fair , israel is a construct of american and european middle eastern policy , so you could argue it either way ... 
  my point was n't relating to the psoe being referred to as a social-democratic party , as in this article , they are referred to as a * socialist party * , which is n't a title that anyone i know would attribute . 
  especially considering that earlier in the year they were supposedly considering a coalition with the pp ( or at least held talks with them ) . 
  you wot m8 ? 
  do you know who i am ? 
  ronnie pickering !, 
  i 'm ronnie pickering !, 
  be careful when referencing the psoe as socialist , at this point , most spaniards i 've met would call podemos the grassroots socialist movement and the psoe a centre-left party . 
  hey , france , look , i know we 've spent more time at war with each other in the last 2,000 years than any other country and feel the need to berate each other at every opportunity , but all the same , i do admit , you mean a lot to us here in the uk . 
  france is truly a amazing nation , with incredible architecture , passionate people , great food and amazing glorious scenery . 
  we 're secretly proud to be your neighbour and friend . 
  - the uk, 
   cameron : fighting his backbenches ftfy, 
  hey , i thought this was a better deal than the actual one we got , at least in this one there is more than just vague cop-out statements ( which are what the eu is practically built on ... ) and something `` brakes '' which will never be used ... at least you could actually do something with the leftover sandwiches ... 
  i 'll still be voting to remain due to my own personal circumstances , but if i was in the situation of many who are on the fence , i 'd hardly be jumping to the remain camp just because of this renegotiation ... 
  i think that was the election policy of most governments to be fair ... 
  i like the way that came from someone with a tag for england , suggesting you are from the uk , a country which is taking less refugees than finland ... 
  lets put it at this , i 'm a southerner , born in oxford , raised in wales and now resident in the gem of the north , i learned to understand the accent surprisingly quickly , yorkshire is one of the more accessible of the dialects in the uk , compared to some of the things you can find which pass for english in the brecon beacons ... 
  i would n't say that the scientific community is entirely on your side : it has been well researched and it is suggested that air travel is a major contributor to climate change . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sunday-review/the-biggest-carbon-sin-air-travel.html https://www.eta.co.uk/environmental-info/air-travels-impact-on-climate-change/ http://www.aef.org.uk/downloads/flynowfull.pdf http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/06/aviation-q-and-a http://www.flyingclean.com/impacts_airplane_pollution_climate_change_and_health http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150713113257.htm http://www.travellink.fi/images/pc/sdeals/pdf/travel_report_xxxx_080731.pdf http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1654488,00.html that 's not to say that other factors do n't have influence , of course the meat industry is far from environmentally friendly and yes , natural change does have an impact of climate ( to do with solar output , orbit , volcanic activity and other factors ) but it is clear that change is needed to reduce air travel 's carbon footprint ( which could be done by reducing it 's usage ) whilst also making it less polluting and more energy efficient . 
  ` ey up duck , wot 's ` appenin ' round ` ere ? 
  mesen and a couple o ' r ' t lads from ' t mill woz just ` eded dow n't pub through ' t ginnel aft ' r ` twerk at ' t old steel mill and one o ' r 'em just saw that some nut like yasen ` ad posted owt ` bowt sheffield , so we thought we 'd gerrin o n't party . 
  case and point , jeremy corbyn ... 
  i did n't see this , if so , i 'm in the wrong ... do you have a link ? 
  debatable , considering the current leading party in the uk ( the conservatives - the party which is so elite that most of it 's prominent members went to eaton ... ) has argued against taking in asylum seekers and has made pledges to cut down in immigration ... 
  yes , but the point is that then they will be taken on board and processed , rather than reaching greece illegally and drawing this sort of criticism from other nations , or drowning in the sea . 
  i 'd say that if countries like are going to join in criticizing the efforts of the greek coast guard , the least they can do is offer a helping hand to fix the problem . 
  i do think that other european nations could be more involved in terms of patrolling some of the greek islands near turkey , to help find and deal with people , either turning them back or move them into centers for processing , it would take significant stress off the overstretched greek coast guard . 
  ( i 'm looking at my own government here ... ), 
  because for some reason , despite being prepared to give up their internal borders , many countries thought that a combined policing and borders agency would be a step to far ( partially as it would require all involved countries to combining parts of their legal systems and laws , which would be incredibly complex ) and also as it was perceived as a step too far in terms of giving up powers , hence it was never adopted . 
  no america , you ran away from home and we are n't letting you back in !, 
  you were always our favorite ... now all we have is the one who 's obsessed with `` barbies '' , the one with the weird shouty dance , the one who is too close with cows , a couple of islands and canada , who could n't start a war if they tried ... why did you have to leave ? 
  at this point we may as well dig up the corpse of the league of nations and use that to give disapproving looks , considering it would probably have more power and support than the un and the eu combined ... 
  the whole point is , countries like greece and italy would never conform to that , they are already going through economic hardship and processing refugees would mean they have to offer them asylum , hence , they 'd rather leave them to roam free illegally , to avoid having to take them in . 
  it 's suggested that the perpetrator of the crime was between 14-17 , although , as you say , that may have been a fake age . 
  it 's probably the amount of travel that i do which makes me think that , that and the fact that i spend around 3 months of the year in spain and the other 9 in uk , hence i 'm torn . 
  european , british/spanish , welsh , yorkshireman in that order . 
  i see that and i raise you the house of commons : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qu7s-wox0m, 
  they would be correct in thinking that all the same , it 's likely , if they get proper housing , they 'll have less sympathy . 
  however , the australian model is not generally cited as a good one for controlling immigration at all , nor is it particularly humane : `` http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-31827074 '' `` http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23387514 '' `` http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26236157 '' you may note that in 1992 mandatory detention was implimented , yet it failed to have an impact on levels of immigration , which continued to grow up to 2008 .

  he 's ours and you ca n't bloody well have him !, 
  i 'll write you a very strongly worded letter !, 
  and invite you for a tea to discuss the matter . 
  and before you ask it 's called morning tea and not fika !!, 
  ^ but ^ seriously , ^ can ^ yorkshire ^ join ^ in ^ if ^ the ^ scots ^ get ^ to , ^ pretty ^ please ? 
  i 'd just inquire as to how we plan to work out who is and is n't a refugee without many of them holding paperwork and in some cases , many having fake passports ? 
  working out who is and is n't an economic migrant is easier when dealing with countries with well developed and systematic governments , but when many are coming from places with a lack of infrastructure , they remain undocumented , hence why it becomes so much more complex . 
  as for the borders , i think it is something which should be high on the eu 's agenda , yet , as i understand it , there are too many nations who are afraid of giving up sovereignty and control of their borders on the fringes , hence it becomes complex to negotiate . 
  my question relates more to the question of where are we going to put these people ? 
  personally , i hardly think that leaving them there is helping anything in the situation and it is clear that france is n't going to act alone , surely it 's best if we joining with them to try and solve this together , rather than putting the integrity of our borders at risk . 
  what do you suggest we do with them in that case ? 
  personally , i think leaving them in calais where they are right now is creating more of a problem than moving them would .
