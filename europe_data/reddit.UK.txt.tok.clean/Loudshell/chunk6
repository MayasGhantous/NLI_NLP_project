  as well as that , my disagreement with the saudi 's continues on to the fact that they are know to have links with terrorist groups in iraq and syria ( da'esh comes to mind ) who have de-stabilized the region massively and are currently running a brutal active military campaign in yemen . 
  are these the people we really want to call `` our close ally '' ? ... 
  we have a duty to hold places like this to account . 
  in my opinion , human rights and welfare should * always * come above economic interest . 
  yet for some reason , we still have active trade deals with this barbaric state , despite it 's human rights record and inhumane punishments . 
  that 's what happens when your only social interaction is throwing cinnamon at people . 
  you could have titled this * brexit : uk 's growing impatience over uk 's lack of clarity - bbc news * and it 'd still be accurate , literally noone has a clue what the hell is going on ... 
  well , it 's exactly how they 've been conditioned to react - not to mention the fact that for most soldiers it always comes down to - kill them or see my teammates get killed , you can guess which they prefer . 
  all the same , sarkozy has now called for a nationwide ban : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/burkini-row-nicolas-sarkozy-calls-for-nationwide-ban - i somewhat doubt this is going to be a temporary measure , unfortunately . 
  by the same logic , i do n't like the way tracksuits look - and i do n't think they are a presentable way to be dressed when you 're outside . 
  but , i 'm not asking the government to ban them and start fining people in the street for wearing them . 
  government 's place is to better society using soft pressure , but not forcefully direct it in any direction . 
  we should n't set our moral standards in relation to a barbaric regime - we should set them in relation to our own liberal society ... 
  i do n't understand this ... we ( rightly ) criticse groups like da'esh when they go and destroy ancient sites in the name of their batshit crazy interpretation of religion , but the minute it 's to do with profit - ` let the demolition begin ! ' . 
  this is a travesty which our ancestors will never forgive us for - the loss of art and culture is never merited ... 
  funny thing is , they were n't ... 
  the remain campaign focused almost entirely on the economic damage of leaving , with a vague mention of potential reform , whilst the leave campaign obsessed over things like turkey joining and made vague statements like ` take back control ' ... 
  the actual arguments were heavily diluted down by most media outlets , meaning that only a very small number of people were actually discussing the genuine ramifications of voting either way ... 
  well , even if you are against the eu , surely you can still see some positives of it ? 
  i 'm the opposite way - i 'm pro-eu , but i can understand that there are some very viable arguments against it . 
  dammit man , where were you when the uk had it 's referendum ? ... 
  hardly surprising considering ukip 's main political goal was to get the uk out of the eu ... 
  i hate to be that guy , but i 'm a northerner with welsh heritage - and i 'm probably one of the more ` passionate ' remain campaigners around ... - it 's best not to load massive populations all into the same boat for the sake of your strawman ... 
  well , yes and no - there 's a different between not being enticing and favouring a humanitarian approach . 
  i 'll be honest , i do n't think there 's enough there to constitute a clear statement , which is probably why reputable news sources had n't picked up the story and hence why i had n't heard of it . 
  i feel that you may be confusing farage with andrea leadsom ? 
  * the following is much more representative of his views on immigration and immigrants : * http://www.ukipdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ukip-poster-manchester-620x264.jpg http://cdn1.theweek.co.uk/sites/theweek/files/styles/16x9_710/public/140422-ukip-poster.jpg?itok=x79jtlsa http://cdn2.theweek.co.uk/sites/theweek/files/styles/theweek_insert_main_image/public/ukip-builder-poster.jpg?itok=civ-lqmr http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/01/25/nigel-farage_n_6540998.html http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/ten-other-things-nigel-farage-has-tried-to-blame-on-immigration--ey8rkw_kfg http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-we-are-experiencing-a-romanian-crime-wave-8829566.html http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-27459923, 
  it was said that during the 2008 crash , it would have be more effective to drop money from planes than to give it to the banks - in terms of boosting the economy . 
  that principle clearly still stands ... 
  the thing is - for the eu to remain even relatively organised and together - and to avoid other countries pushing to leave , the eu needs to be ` firm ' in it 's negotiations with the uk . 
  i do n't want it to be , but i feel like that may be the only path forward for it ... 
  i dunno , that 's the impression i got from a lot of ukip 's statements during the campaign ... 
  or in the case of many uk voters - voting to leave the eu to show dissent against westminster ... 
  here-in lies the problem . 
  germany is already overburdened , the uk does n't want anything to do with refugees and hence , the cycle continues ... 
  what would be a viable solution would be to pay large sums of money to greece in return for it housing refugees and helping to build camps with semi-hospitable conditions . 
  the issue is the fact that , all of that costs * looots * of money - and many member states ca n't afford to fit the bill . 
  once again , the way the uk justifies it 's actions on cyprus is that it argues that firstly , cyprus provides a strategic base from which it can launch missions into the middle east and secondly , that the uk is helping stop conflict on the island itself , between the turkish occupied north and the cypriot south . 
  ^ ^ [ to ^ ^ clarify , ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ necessarily ^ ^ agree ^ ^ with ^ ^ that ^ ^ position , ^ ^ but ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ how ^ ^ the ^ ^ uk ^ ^ government ^ ^ would ^ ^ justify ^ ^ it ], 
  so you are suggesting that somehow the eu is the driving force behind the movements for scottish , catalonian , galician and basque independence ? 
  the eu has directly told catalonia it would be [ ` no longer able to be part of the eu ' ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-elections-2014/video/brussels-says-an-independent-catalonia-would-need-to-leave-eu/ ) and warned scotland that it would be `` extremely difficult , if not impossible '' for scotland to join the via eu if it left the uk . 
  also , i hate to break it to you , but , every country in the eu has ` cultural faults ' - no state would want to advocate independence movements , as they 'd risk themselves . 
  building onto that , the ` supranational eu approach ' is directly informed by it 's member states ( who choose the commission , form the council and elect the parliament ... ) - this conspiracy you 've created is all in your head ... 
  you 've gone from regional cultural heritage to personally held national identity . 
  those are two * verrryyy * different concepts ... what you seem to suggest that the eu is directly moving with malice to ` force ' this identity upon people , which is hardly the case ... 
  the reason for the growth in the ` european ' identity , is mainly due to the way in which the eu ( and european countries as a whole ) have opened up cross-border travel and trade - hence why countries with close neighbours like luxemborg have such ` europeanised ' populations and also why people in international schools are more likely to identify as european , rather than of their country of origin . 
  right , it 's quite evident you do n't understand the distinction between political union and cultural dissolution ... 
  the tor ' * ever closer union * ' clause , has - and likely always will , relate to the eu 's goal to create a federalised state - something it 's never tried to hide . 
  it does not link to a desire to ` destroy ' or amalgamate each individual region 's culture . 
  the reason that a ` federalised state ' was favoured was because the one of the eu 's other core goals is * `` safeguarding and enhancing europe 's cultural heritage '' * . 
  please , do , provide me with any firm evidence which shows that is ( or was ) the case ... 
  here in the uk , the eu ( used to ) do a lot of good work to conserve local and regional cultures , through cuisine , renovation of historical sites and funding for cultural groups ... - source : local historical conservation society , national trust membership , english heritage membership ( https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/actions/european-heritage-label_en ) ( https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/actions/heritage-prize_en ) ( https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/actions/heritage-days_en ) maybe do some research ... 
  could we have a reliable translation for this article ? 
  - google translate and a vague knowledge of french from 3 years ago are n't quite cutting it for me here !, 
  well , the rock of gibraltar was ( and still is ) the gateway to the mediterranean - and it 's straights are one of the busiest zones for shipping in the world . 
  hence , for a nation with vested interest in global sea trade , it makes sense that we want to keep control of it - that 's why the uk is so protective over it and other places such as the falklands . 
  hold your horses sailor !, 
  we 're not selling them opium ... ^ yet ... 
  can we not ? ... 
  this is the sort of issue which we need to get round a table and negotiate about , before any kind of incident does take place ... - there needs to be a clear guideline for both sides , or else this situation * will * get worse as soon as the uk attempts to leave the eu ... 
  more freedom you say ? ...

  the main issue with a lot of ukip voters is the lack of link between the concept immigration and immigrants as people - it 's something we see all the time in my local area . 
  for example , there is a group of poles who run a fish 'n chip shop and a group of ukip members who like to go and run a street stall across the road from it . 
  at lunchtime , the ` kippers are quite happy to head over to the chippy and chat away with the owners like they are old friends - then not long after , they 're back to complaining about immigration . 
  as for the ` ignoring the facts ' , that mainly comes down to a lack of trust for anything stated by the government - which to be fair , can be quite ` misrepresentative ' at times ... 
  no you ca n't , but when they try to do it through illegal means , then there is a reason to act . 
  the issue is also that , the perception of europe is far from the reality , hence why people can become so impassioned about getting here - and why they proceed to break laws and try and get in illegally . 
  that 's why it 's so hard to deal with this crisis . 
  b. . . b. ... b.b. . but they did n't get either right ... europe makes [ better cars ] ( http://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/quality-comparison-european-sports-cars-vs-american-sports-cars ) than the us and is [ as free ] ( https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/fiw-2016-map.png ) , if not [ more-so in some areas ] ( https://rsf.org/en/news/united-states-ranks-41st-reporters-without-borders-2016-world-press-freedom-index ) . 
  i 'd take iceland with a pinch of salt , considering almost all of their energy comes from geothermal power - hence the expansion of their production has practically no environmental impact . 
  looks to be a [ lockheed c-5 galaxy ] ( http://www.airteamimages.com/pics/122/122189_800.jpg ) - one of the world 's largest planes , literally designed to carry other planes inside it ... 
  the only thing more ` murican is the nimtz class aircraft carrier ... 
  i 'd imagine it 's quite likely that she - like any other migrant or refugee , has heard the stories that places like germany are heaven on earth , with jobs and housing aplenty . 
  that 's the impression a lot of people are given , hence they see it as their ` only option ' to escape poverty/war/social issues in their home country . 
  not yet , but i have been - as a ukip voter , eu is one of my trigger words . 
  * ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ filthy ^ ^ ^ un-sarcastic ^ ^ ^ continentals *, 
  speaking from the uk perspective - our main argument is not that we do n't want to help refugees , it 's that we want to do it differently . 
  the uk prefers the policy of keeping people safe in countries near to the one they have originated from so that , when the war ends , they can go back easily . 
  as well as this , refugees are less likely to experience alienation in countries closer to their nation of origin . 
  due to this , we favour a programme which funds the construction and maintaining of refugee camps abroad , whilst also taking those who can not stay in neighbouring countries ( generally those who are most vulnerable ) . 
  that 's how i can explain my nation 's choices . 
  depends - parts of the uk green party especially seem to follow a similar line to this . 
  however , as you say , i would n't agree that it is a ` mainstream left ' view to say that illegal immigrants should be allowed to continue unhindered in the uk . 
  ( or at least i hope it is n't ... ), 
  ( european ) waves - ruled \u2713 ( israeli ) jerusalem - builded \u2713 ( german ) queen - saved \u2713 ( saxon ) country - vowed to \u2713 what now continent ? 
  the thing with morocco is that , even if it has n't experienced a major publicised attack , there are still fears over the conflicts both in the south and in the east of the country - and the fact that it 's in north africa often means it gets ` lumped in ' with tunisia algeria and lybia . 
  there was a reason i specified ` central ' rather than the outlying districts . 
  you 're correct , 5p is hardly anything in terms of cost , but it 's enough to make people think . 
  the charge was put in place less as a method to produce income , but rather as a method of reducing waste - which it has clearly succeeded at . 
  technically gsg9 is an incorporation of the federal police - however , in terms of practice they are comparable to the us swat units . 
  so no , they are not military , however they do have a comparable level of training to any special forces unit . 
  i certainly hope so as well - the issue is the fact that half of the world seems to believe this shit - and i do n't really understand why ... 
  well , like anything , it depends where you are . 
  for example , if you go to downtown baltimore or detroit , it 's much more dangerous . 
  on the other hand , going to central chicago or san francisco is as safe as any european city . 
  apologies , i came across wrong - the point was that , between 44-88 % of france 's population is catholic and it 's church relies on large transfers of money between it and rome - hence , it seems unlikely that any government would want to risk irritating such a massive voting block , thus i doubt that they would ban all religious institutions from moving money .

  no , we 're not ` cool with that ' - of course we want everyone to be employed and have equal opportunities , but the way we fix that is from the bottom up - by educating both women and men to the same standards , by giving them the same legal rights in terms of employment and by not patronising people with positive discrimination quotas .
