  there was police activity shortly after the attack at a semi-detached house on the fieldhead estate in birstall . 
  thomas mair , 52 , is the registered occupier of the address , according to the electoral roll , vikram dodd , nazia parveen and rob booth report . 
  a police cordon surrounded the house as a helicopter circled overheard and forensic officers in boiler suits appeared to be searching the neat front garden , as well as around garages at the back of the well-maintained property . 
  neighbours on the fieldhead council estate said the man had lived here 40 years with a female relative , who died a number of years ago , leaving him alone . 
  kathleen cooke , 62 , said she and her daughter , emma john , 30 , had seen mair half an hour before the attack . 
  `` i looked out of the window at about 12.30 and he walked past a carrying his bag , wearing a cap . 
  he looked perfectly calm and normal , '' said john . 
  `` he was a quiet person , kept himself to himself . 
  we knew him around here from when he used to do our gardens , '' said cooke . 
  one woman , who gave her name just as karen , said mair did her mother 's garden regularly until a few years ago . 
  he did n't seem to have a job , she said . 
  local teenagers said he was a quiet man unless they congregated on the wall behind his house , which he did n't like . 
  `` he 'd shout at us , '' said a 17-year-old . 
  `` all this we are hearing now is totally at odds with the man we thought we knew , '' said one neighbour . 
  `` we knew him as someone who helped out , who did volunteering . '', 
  west yorkshire police news conference posted at 16:59 west yorkshire police are about to give a news conference on the attack on jo cox . 
  you can watch it live here : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10318089, 
  local resident sam watson told the bbc that people from nearby shops rushed to help . 
  he said : we were outside there and then we heard loads of screaming and then we looked down the corner . 
  there were a woman lying behind a red car . 
  and then when we looked over the road , some of the sandwich and co , from another sandwich shop across the road , were getting another man that was injured and bringing him into their shop . 
  and then the guy had a black hat on , and he was just casually walking away . 
  he were n't running - he was just walking . 
  he walked up through the market . 
  it most certainly looks like the assailant went out with intent to kill her . 
  he shot her 3 times with an improvised weapon and supposedly also swiped at her with a hunting knife . 
  it 's genuinely upsetting the detail they have gone into relating to this absolutely brutal attack ... 
  we 've got the same thing reported by the bbc , guardian and telegraph here in the uk . 
  as for britain first - they are a far right , semi-militaristic fringe group - associated with the alt right and islamophobic movement ( a breakoff from the edl ) . 
  they 've advocated leaving the eu on several occasions , however deny links with the attack . 
  ( that 's not to say that could n't have inspired it ) . 
  jo cox shooting : media briefing at 17:00 oli woodcock bbc local live , leeds posted at 16:04 the latest details about the attack on batley and spen labour mp jo cox will be given by west yorkshire police at a news briefing at 17:00 . 
  we have no clue , but that is the link that people have been making ... 
  the guy is believed to be associated with the far right - though at this time reports are unconfirmed . 
  please note , i 'm not saying that this is in any way condoned by the leave campaign or any people advocating leaving - this is a standalone extremist attack by the looks of it . 
  1 ) because the guy was a crazed violent nutjob ? 
  2 ) multiple witnesses have now cooberated that statement ... 
  we 've just had this eyewitness account of the attack on batley and spen labour mp jo cox in birstall this afternoon from hichem ben abdallah : ben told us he saw a `` river of people running down the road , screaming and running towards the scene '' . 
  he saw a white man of medium height , wearing a baseball cap and grey clothes who was hitting mrs cox . 
  he then saw a man trying to restrain the man who was hitting the mp . 
  then the man wearing a baseball cap pulled a gun out of his bag and pointed it at jo and fired two shots . 
  terry flynn-edwards , who runs the divine hair studio , opposite the scene of the attack , said a man from the dry cleaners had tried to stop the attack . 
  she said : `` she walked out of the library with her pa and he was waiting for her . 
  he stabbed her first and this guy tried to stop him and then he shot her . '', 
  jo cox update : eye witness account posted at 15:35 a local cafe owner clarke rothwell saw what happened . 
  he said she thought jo cox had been shot and stabbed . 
  i could hear a loud popping noise that sounded like a balloon burst - a loud balloon - and when i looked round there 's a man stood there in his 50s with a white baseball cap on and a jacket with a gun , an old fashioned looking gun in his hand , and he shot this lady once and then he shot her again , she fell to the floor , lent over shot her once more in the face area . '', 
  clarke rothwell police are also investigating reports the suspect shouted `` britain first '' , a possible reference to the far-right political party , as he launched the attack . 
  graeme howard , 38 , who lives in nearby bond street , told the guardian he heard the man shout `` britain first '' before the shooting and during the arrest . 
  police were understood to be talking to at least one witness who claimed to have heard the attacker shout words about the right-wing group , and the motivation for the incident will form part of their inquiry `` i heard the shot and i ran outside and saw some ladies from the cafe running out with towels , '' he said . 
  `` there was loads of screaming and shouting and the police officers showed up . 
  `` he was shouting britain first when he was doing it and being arrested . 
  he was pinned down by two police officers and she was taken away in an ambulance . '', 
  notably , they 've also been denounced by every major christian organisation in the uk because of it . . 
  this has been cancelled due to a british mp being shot https://twitter.com/david_cameron/status/743450434224939008?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw, 
  the border tensions have been going ever since around 5 years ago , this looks like a revival all the same ... 
  well , it 's quite likely that spain would abuse gibraltar quite a bit ... i.e they 'd make border crossings even harder and possibly even pursue economic sanctions . 
  - assuming rajoy 's pp retain control of government in the upcoming election . 
  [ warning ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/711/699/155.png ) this account is this account is 3 days old ... 
  not quite - the idea i 've been getting is that the issue is the fact that people have been trying to spin this as ` an attack on western values ' rather than one directly inspired by homophobia and bigotry . 
  yes , yes , yes and yes - but also no . 
  the uk can survive outside the eea ( if it really needs to ... ) , but all major bodies say it 's preferable ( economically ) to stay in - all the same , the british public seem to be putting their tin hats on and ignoring a lot of what they are being told due to fearmongering by the leave side over immigration and regulations . . 
  i dunno , recently , it 's become awfully polarized . 
  - i say this as someone whose been posting there since i first joined reddit more than 2 years ago . 
  - it 's increasingly the case that it disproportionately represents ukip and green voters ... 
  would i be correct in saying it 's similar to the uk 's realtionship with france or germany ? 
  - allies in practice , but the minute the football starts , it 's like it 's 1870 again ... 
  firstly , i 'd argue , for the state to attempt to impose the ideology it supports ( in this case secularism ) and constrain those it does n't is repression of the people ( and we 've seen how well that 's gone in places like turkey ... ) - yes , i agree , the state should not give impartial support to any religious tendency ( i.e separation of church and state ) . 
  however , at the same time , to tell people they are not allowed to practice their religion in a place where they study or work ( as long as it does n't disrupt others ) seems oppressive to me ... and secondly , you have evidence to prove that these are delusions how ? 
  what makes your opinion about the existence of god and the way you carry out your life any more significant or right that that of religious people ? 
  - it 's fine to have an opinion , but to immediately dismiss those of others as ` wrong ' is hardly the way forward . 
  well , personally i 'm biased towards lanzarote ( believe it or not ! ), 
  but it very much depends on what your cup of tea is . 
  as you say , [ tenerife ] ( http://www.rockroutesholidays.com/sites/default/files/guide/2071649431_36ef74bd9b_b.jpg ) and [ gran canaria ] ( http://www.grancanaria.com/patronato_turismo/uploads/pics/grancanaria_lpgc_07.jpg ) are very well built up - and are very clearly geared towards ` general ' mass tourism . 
  - it 's something which some people are all for , but personally i do n't think they quite have the ` charm ' and ` adventure ' factor of some of the other islands . 
  if you want an island which is geared around extreme sports ( on land and sea ) and adventure , with dramatic volcanic landscapes ( [ the lava flows of timanfaya ] ( http://www.rockroutesholidays.com/sites/default/files/guide/timanfaya1.jpg ) are an incredible sight for example ) , lanzarote would be for you . 
  another thing to note about lanzarote is the fact that the island banned skyscrapers and tried to ensure that it would n't end up like puerto de la cruz . 
  hence , there is only [ one on the island ] ( http://www.aghotelspa.com/sites/default/files/styles/flexslider_full/public/localizacion-arrecife-gran-hotel_1.jpg?itok=5xjenueo ) in the capital , it 's successfully retained a lot of local cultures due to the work of artist and statesman cesar manrique , who is regarded as a legend on the island . 
  fuerteventura has some of the [ best natural beaches of all of the islands ] ( https://d1ez3020z2uu9b.cloudfront.net/imagecache/blog-photos/3588_fill_670_0.jpg ) and is in a very similar state to lanzarote ( insomuch as it is relatively [ barren ] ( http://blog.monarch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/b5006_196752_01505_fuerteventura.jpg ) - and not very built up . 
  i prefer this , however , if you are partial to trees , neither of these places will be for you !, 
  - both are completely alien enviroments - which you would n't expect to find on this earth , let alone within the borders of europe . 
  on the other hand , if you want a more traditional canarian experience , i could n't recommend [ el hierro ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/el_mocanal.el_hierro.jpg ) more - it 's the most remote of the islands - and hence has retained a lot of local charm imo . 
  it 's main industries still seem to be fishing and goat farming - [ tourism is hardly established ] ( http://www.canarieonline.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/el-hierro.jpg ) there - which for me , is a draw , but others find it alienating . 
  what i can say that all the canary islands have in common are some of the most welcoming and friendly locals i 've ever met . 
  - the people are half of the reason that i love the islands so much . 
  it 's a beach called playa papagayo on lanzarote in the spanish canary islands - it 's [ here ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/playa+del+papagayo/@28.8426224,-13.7882721,243m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0000000000000000:0xc69613a8f6382eaf!8m2!3d28.8425974!4d-13.7880329 ) on a map !, 
  i ultimately chose it because a ) it 's around 1/2 an hour from my house , b ) i wanted to show that there is a different aspect to europe than just lush pretty mountain forests , rural farming scenes and big cities ( not that i have a problem with any of those beautiful landscapes either ) and c ) it 's one of my favorite snorkeling sites in the world - and fueled my love for the sea !, 
  would n't that be infringing upon citizens fundamental rights ? 
  ( see article 9 of the hra ), 
  i 've got to ask - in relation to your earlier comment `` article 9b : the right to be stupid . '', 
  - what makes your beliefs so clearly correct , whilst those of religious people are so clearly wrong ? 
  alright , then why use that to constrain christians , jews and hindus - who also pray ? ... 
  not necessarily , because voting trends would be different under pr - in that there would n't be tactical voting , hence we may well see libdems coming out of the woodwork and so on . 
  no , what i 'm saying is that the suggestion that leaving would somehow ` boost ' the uk 's economy is completely inaccurate ... 
  i 'm not saying they 'll stop trading , but it 's clear that investors from several countries will be less attracted to the uk than they would be if we were in the eea/eec member . 
  - it 'd be a big loss for the uk economy ... 
  because i won a competition , hence get a shiny - i also chose this weeks / r/europe banner !, 
  care to say which former colonies ? 
  - because canada , australia , new zealand , the usa and india have all suggested preference to the uk remaining in the eu . 
  ( that 's without talking about other countries which also say we are better off in for trade purposes .
