  no , you 're being arrogant . 
  you have no place iin this conversation . 
  i never said stalism was `` true '' communism but you keep acting like a smug bastard , cherrypicking my words . 
  ah , boohoo , you are an educated norweigian boy . 
  good for you . 
  you just want to feel superior to me who is a `` brainwashed capitalist '' . 
  little do you know my mother grew up under stalinism . 
  now sod off and ** do n't ** talk to me again . 
  the discussion about this ended , and you 're trying to seem all smart and intellectual when actually you are arrogant and misleading . 
  i wo n't even continue this . 
  grow up you socialist crybaby . 
  i do n't care about your whining `` but that 's not ideal communism ! '', 
  while never ever saying `` that 's not ideal capitalism '' also , the argument ended . 
  put your entitled arse elsewhere, 
  yeah , i never knew that . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
  by the way - get a flair !, 
  fair enough . 
  just as a small note , it 's spelt `` parliament '', 
  well there 's a difference between being a job hunter and being a neckbeard . 
  it all depends on perspective . 
  i think at 25 it 's acceptable . 
  28 is worrying . 
  30 is bye-bye, 
  you really want to live with a 28 year old dew chugger ? 
  if they are children , sure , but there comes a point where i think : holy shit . 
  by the way , you 're my favourite person on this sub . 
  i love your o_o emoticons and writing style . 
  never change < 3, 
  huh ? 
  no , i meant assuming op was a woman ( steelheart ** ellie ** ) , the thought about me dating her turned me gay , so i would n't volunteer . 
  no need to downvote my swamp german friend , 
  the thought of it turned me gay . 
  op can marry you, 
  indeed it is . 
  do you have steam ? 
  maybe we could play something sometime . 
  hmm . 
  this was a nice discussion anyway . 
  it was nice to have a discussion without resorting to hatred , haha . 
  i think for many countries , the thing of being rich and free  very rich and restricted helps us stay free in poorer countries , this is n't always the case , however , and it is n't so black and white, 
   is it correctly assumed that you are an original liberalist ? 
  i would probably say somewhat , yes , although i do have some conservative elements . 
  i generally believe that more restrictive governments can actually be better for economic growth - at least , in the short term , and such an enjoyable socialist state could actually slow our progress . 
  furthermore , many countries have corrupt governments , and foreign aid is the only money that they can not realistically embezzle . 
  most of our money from benefits system does not come from the wealthy but in fact countries like china . 
  i do n't think we should tax the rich more because - let 's face it , they wo n't pay . 
  at least , get something , rather than nothing , and we may see some results , and use that money to get some trade partners in the process . 
  i think that for any `` socialism '' to work , we need all the world to catch up . 
  the best way for this would be a capitalist based system , which has proven to improve many countries already . 
  once we are at the stage that every country relies on one another , maybe then we can reach a more perfect society . 
  also i do n't think either engels nor marx should followed precisely . 
  their texts are archaic at best . 
  a society , similar to much of western europe , would be preferrable . 
  then once we get robots we can kick back and relax . 
  i do know what socialism is . 
  i know that marxism is n't stalinism . 
  but you have to understand that russia was a very unstable place , and your lovely idea of `` athiesm , everyone gets according to what they need '' would n't work back then . 
  at least , not well . 
  i 'd be pretty damn socialist if every single person had a hard working mindset and we could get luxuries for harder work akin to the ussr and many countries today . 
  you ca n't shun the ussr completely without knowing the context another thing , of course stalinsm is far from communism . 
  because everyone in the world would need to be a communist for it to work . 
  now tell me that the ussr did n't get close ? 
  they could have just reformed if they succeeded , after all . 
  it was a means to an end . 
  if they kept it on the whole time , they still have the same mindset . 
  yes , they weighed it just as high . 
  how the hell would you suggest to run the soviet union without getting overthrown . 
  you ca n't say it 's not communism when they wanted to achieve that . 
  but how can you make people work hard . 
  because they want to ? 
  you believe that ? 
  you 've obviously never worked before . 
  in communism , people never work above average because it achieves nothing . 
  you ca n't say stalinism is n't a way of reaching communism - it 's like saying isis is secular . 
  take responsibility for your own branches and do n't tell someone to read a book as your argument - that 's bloody insane !, 
  no , because they carried on past that date . 
  no , it 's more like demanding that you call america social conservative , another country market liberal , another social democrat . 
  republicanism is a political party , not a branch like you were thinking of . 
  aquitane , and many provencial languages , were almost completely wiped out . 
  something like 65 % of france was aquit\u00e0nian . 
  afterwards , only 15 . 
  basque is mainly a spanish thing , and breton only survived due to much effort . 
  it 's still not that common . 
  washington post ? 
  sorry , but it is pretty much pedantism . 
  no one is going to refer to them by their branches . 
  it 's just a bit silly . 
   the french did n't get rid of bretagne , basque ect erm ... do you literally know anything ? 
  or is this observation ? 
  i do n't know , i would n't be so inclined of my kid was a neckbeardy failure , who could achieve nothing . 
  i do n't think they are . 
  if your child is a neckbeardy failure who brings no good to your life , i see no reason why not to . 
  you ca n't disinherit yout children unless if they try to murder you ? 
  that 's ridiculous !, 
  you do n't know / u/goeie-ouwe-henk . 
  he always does that and it 's kinda funny, 
  what ? 
  i just said bradford is very asian ... 
  you mean #parmageddon ?
