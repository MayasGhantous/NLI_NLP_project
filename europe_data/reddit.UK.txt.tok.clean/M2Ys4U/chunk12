  well , not quite , no . 
  it has to be * necessary in a democratic society * , and iirc ecthr jurisprudence says that it also has to be proportionate . 
   fish and chips ( which they ruin by pouring vinegar on it ) . 
  : o take that back !, 
  the president of the european parliament represents the european parliament in foreign relations , he addresses the european council before each meeting regarding parliament 's viewpoint on the subjects on the agenda , has regular meetings with the commission president on `` key horizontal issues and major legislative proposals '' and takes part in ministerial-level meetings when intergovernmental conferences are called to discuss treaty change . 
  there 's nothing in the treaty on european union or the treaty on the functioning of the european union about the president of the european parliament being obligated to remain impartial , nor is there anything in the rules of procedure of the european parliament ( aside from [ rule 20 , paragraph 3 ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-//ep//text+rules-ep+20130701+rule-020+doc+xml+v0//en&amp;language=en&amp;navigationbar=yes ) which reads `` the president may speak in a debate only to sum up or to call speakers to order . 
  should he wish to take part in a debate , he shall vacate the chair and shall not reoccupy it until the debate is over '' which does n't apply to the broader point ) . 
  if that were true , sweden would be in the eurozone right now ... 
   martin schulz comes out and does n't say that but espouses that he represents all meps schulz is the president of the european parliament , so in that capacity he * does * actually represent all 766s meps , at least as a cohort of parliamentarians and at the very least representing the will of parliament . 
   obviously that 's true of a number of areas already , so the most likely form of a completely federal europe can be worked out by extrapolating those further , and assuming all policy areas become eu competences . 
  i mostly agree , but i think the point at which the eu becomes a federal entity is when the eu has competence-competence , that is when the eu can decide which competencies are vested at the federal level and which remain at the member state level . 
  it 's not necessary to have all competencies at the federal level for the eu to be a federal entity , just the * possibility * to legislate that they are . 
   i do n't have a flag of europe flair because i am not in support of eu as it exists now . 
  well the flag is a european flag , not just an eu flag . 
  it was created by the council of europe, 
   the article appears in a eu funded propaganda sheet . 
  clearly they will not approve of ukip who wants the uk to exit the eu and reduce eu power is that why they published [ an article ] ( http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/3842/uk-taxpayer-may-end-up-paying-mortgages-of-foreign-nationals ) by a ukip spokesperson the day before ? 
  worse is better , to coin a phrase . 
  we already have `` radical '' privacy-protection laws in the eu , when you compare them to the us where there are n't really any privacy laws ( except , perhaps , the 4th amendment ) . 
  the problem is we were too eager to create a loophole the size of the channel tunnel to allow data to cross the atlantic without any real safeguards in place . 
  true , it 's not all down to the eu , but similarly it 's not all down to nato either . 
  i think that without nato the eu would n't have been as effective , and without the eu nato would n't have been as effective . 
  and at what point does confirmation bias set in ? 
   so according to the first quote , 200 % of practicing muslims could be doing ramadan ? 
  and then it 's only 85 % ? 
  it does n't make sense , could you clarify or provide sources ? 
  as a corollary , how many people are there who celebrate christmas or easter but are n't practising christians ? 
  as the op said  there 's two conflicting definition [ s ] here : a ethnic one , and a religious one, 
   my initial view was that it was just an alliance like `` yeah we 're friends no bombing and invading each other , k ? '', 
  though i do n't see how that could change for the uk if we left , we wo n't go to war etc ( worst case ) . 
  what is now the european union was founded as the european coal and steel community in 1951 whose members were france , west germany , italy , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg . 
  it was created to tie the heavy industry of those countries together so that it would be economically infeasible for them to declare war on each other as coal and steel were two of the primary raw materials needed to build weapons of war - as the french foreign minister robert schuman said at the time : to `` make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible '' . 
  you also should n't forget that greece , spain and portugal were dictatorships until the mid 70s , they joined the then european communities ( the ecsc , the european atomic energy community and the european economic community ) in 1981 ( greece ) and 1986 ( spain and portugal ) . 
  then there 's the eastern enlargement ; after the end of the cold war and the fall of the iron curtain , there was a lot of political instability and the accession process has lead to a significant stabilisation of eastern europe , with reforms to the rule of law , human rights , and market economies . 
  lastly , there was war in europe following the collapse of yugoslavia until as recently as 1995 - less than 20 years ago . 
  just this month , one of the countries involved ( croatia ) acceded to the eu and became the 28th member state . 
  so although the eu is probably not stopping the uk and other european nations from descending into war , it is stabilising our neighbourhood - and the uk was ( and afaik , still is ) one of the countries pushing for enlargement to the east . 
  that 's good for our safety , the safety of our allies and our economic well-being . 
   what a do hear that does impact us are the silly rules they make us follow which ca n't be the same for every country as every country is different , green taxes and other stuff , energy costs there are different types of eu secondary legislation ( e.g. 
  directives and regulations , to name two ) . 
  directives are * much * more flexible than other forms of eu legislation as they have to be transposed into national law ( i.e. 
  for a directive to have affect the uk must pass an act of parliament ) - this allows for european law to be implemented in a way that 's broadly compatible with local legal and societal customs . 
  regulations , on the other hand , apply directly to every member state without having to be transposed into national law . 
  a good example is the current proposed general data protection regulation which is being developed at the moment to replace the older data protection directive . 
  this is the law that gives you many of your privacy rights . 
  having exactly the same law across all of the eu means that it does n't matter which company processes your data ( as * any * european company can do business in * any * eu member state without discrimination ) you 'll have the same level of protection . 
   also dumb shit like bananas must be x long and x curved or they 're binned , same for potato sizes and other produce which costs our farmers millions ( they 're super market standards not market ofc ) . 
  and that 's all complete nonsense . 
  for a start , there 's no regulation banning bananas that are n't long enough or curved enough . 
  what there is is a grading system . 
  next tie you 're in a supermarket , look at the labels on produce and you 'll see `` class i '' or `` class ii '' etc. 
  these rules are about what can be classified in which class to give consumers guarantees about quality , but there 's * absolutely nothing * stopping anybody from selling any shape fruit or veg . 
  secondly , these are rules that pre-date the european rules you 're talking about , and are more about harmonising the * existing * rules across all of the eu 's member states so that instead of classifying produce to 28 different sets of rules you only have to do it * once * , and that allows you to sell your produce * anywhere * within the eu without any additional regulatory burden . 
  people who complain about things like that are , quite frankly , stupid . 
  they 're ostensibly complaining about red tape but do n't realise that the regulations * remove * red tape . 
   also we do n't even use the euro and the pound is and always has been strong , i 've never really felt part of the eu , other than geographically . 
  the eu is the largest economy in the world . 
  whether or not you * feel * part of the eu does n't mean you do n't benefit economically . 
   farage never says anything about the economy , other than saying britain spends # 50m per day to be part of europe ( conveniently sidestepping the money back out from trade and stuff ) it 's not sidestepping anything , it 's an outright lie . 
  even * before * eu expenditure in the uk is accounted for , he 's over-stating the uk 's contribution by almost ** $ 10 billion ** a year . 
  when you take in to account the expenditure the discrepancy rises to more than ** $ 15 billion ** a year . 
  ( see my working out [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/16aoxe/what_does_runitedkingdom_think_about_leaving_the/c7uy7l2?context=5 ) ), 
   has no firsthand experience of life before the eu , concludes it was barbaric and loss of the eu will certainly lead to war . 
  audience ends thought with a `` quite right old chap '' puff on their cigars and stare into the distance as if remembering their time in the wwi trenches . 
  ehh , just because people do n't have first-hand experience does n't necessarily mean that they do n't understand the academic evidence around the issue . 
   i read somewhere that nowadays around 80 % ( maybe it 's an exaggerated number ) of our new laws ( at least in france ) are decided by the eu parliament . 
  yeah , these types of figures are complete and utter bollocks . 
  for france it 's somewhere between 3 % and 26 % . 
  for those that are interested , the figures for some other european nations : uk -- 15.5 % denmark -- 14 % austria -- 10.6 % finland -- between 1 and 24 % germany -- 39.1 % ( [ source ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/06/13/europeanization-of-public-policy/ ) ), 
  unfortunately , they still get elected ... 
  it 's cleaner and safer than other forms of baseline power generation . 
  and before anybody mentions fukushima , when was the last time that germany was hit by a large earthquake or tsunami ? 
  i 'm still bemused by germany 's anti-nuclear policy , to be honest . 
  yes . 
  if you 're an eu citizen you can vote ( and even stand as a candidate ) in the european parliament elections . 
  the same is true for municipal elections in your host member state as well . 
  europe is actually becoming more secular , they 're far from taking over . 
  they keep quite what ? 
   they can get married or join the army at 16 , but only with the written permission of their parents actually , 16 year olds can get married in scotland without parental permission , unlike the other jurisdictions in the uk ( for england and wales it 's 16 with permission , and northern ireland is 17 with permission ) . 
  until recently it was the largest item in the budget , but now it 's the structural and regional development funds . 
  the rebate 's not * all * about the cap , though . 
  we reduced the rebate during enlargement , for example . 
  it did n't help that yes to fairer votes were utterly incompetent . 
  i doubt they could 've even successfully campaigned for a yes vote in a `` do you want a pissup in a brewery ? '', 
  referendum ... 
  well , i 'm pretty sure there 'll be a treaty convention called some time in 2015 anyway , so whichever party or parties make up the next government will be able to press these issues . 
  atheism is the lack of religious belief , having both ` atheism ` and ` no religion ` would be redundant . 
  good thing belief is not a prerequisite of something being true !, 
  i do , but generally only when comparing things that are * relatively * similar across europe ( or at least the eu ) . 
  they both describe a geographical area and the corresponding population . 
  at roughly the same time as the ecsc was established , there were also plans for a defence/military union and also a political union . 
  only the ecsc managed to get off the ground though . 
   the leader of the green party , caroline lucas , lucas is n't the leader of the green party any more , she was replaced by natalie bennett last year, 
   the only way france would ever agree to allow agricultural goods into the agreement is if names such as champagne were protected , meaning that american sparkly wine would not be allowed to be called champagne anymore as a requirement for that would be that it was produced in the champagne region . 
  i have not seen the mandate ( yet ) , but i thought that geographical indicators such as that were on the table already . 
  the more equal a society the better things are in terms of health , life expectancy , murders , imprisonment , education etc. 
  in fact , there 's even a benefit for the richest if society is more equal . 
  have a look at [ this ted talk ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson.html ), 
  six of one and half a dozen of the other . 
  yes !,
