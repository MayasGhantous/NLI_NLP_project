  unfortunately for europe , it has [ blue balls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_balls ) . 
  same here . 
  reducing our rebate was n't just about cap reform , it was also about enlargement . 
  it also has to reach a threshold in 7 member states . 
  a certain figure multiplied by the number of meps that country has . 
  we gave away some of our rebate when the eu was enlarged , so it 's not exactly set in stone . 
  although , a fundamental reform of the cap would probably have to happen before it would be abolished entirely . 
  pretty much, 
   e.g. 
  saying the uk must give prisoners the right to vote well , that 's not exactly what the ecthr ruled . 
  they said that it 's unlawful for the uk to have a * blanket ban * on prisoners having the vote . 
  the uk `` wins '' more ecthr cases than any other member state of the council of europe as well . 
  i say `` wins '' because most cases are rejected by the court outright . 
  well the [ tabs ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/1ix1a52xzw/yg-archive-pol-sunday-times-results-18-200113.pdf ) show the voting intention , how they ( said they ) voted at the 2010 election and their age , location and social grade .

  lobby your mp , especially if they are in the government or on the [ political and constitutional reform committee ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/ ) , and members of the house of lords . 
  check out the electoral reform society as well . 
  sorry , i think we may have crossed wires . 
  basically , my point is that the executive of both institutions are incredibly similar . 
  you said  so , we have an executive body , which is not directly elected by the populace and is not accountable directly to the populace . 
  well neither is the uk executive . 
  we elect members of parliament , not prime ministers or cabinet members . 
  and as i said , not all cabinet ministers are even elected in the first place . 
   question : how do i vote out a prime minister i do n't like . 
   answer : by not voting for his political party . 
  and that 's how you vote out a commission president . 
  according to the lisbon treaty , the nomination for commission president must take in to account the results at the european parliament elections ( i.e. 
  the commission president should be from the political party that has the largest number of meps in the european parliament ) . 
  ( article 17 , teu . 
  see the [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014#candidates_for_commission_president ) for the 2014 election )  question : does the commissioner appointed by the eu and my government represent my interests ? 
   answer : no . 
  he represents eu interests . 
  if you elect an mp and that mp ends up in the cabinet , will he represent your interests or the governing party 's / parties ' interest ? 
  does it not make sense for the executive to represent the entire demos ? 
  on that basis , the commons is not part of the executive either . 
  there is no eu presidency ... 
  there is no eu president . 
  open party lists or stv would help . 
  that 's a problem with the media and voter education , then . 
  that 's not true , cabinet ministers are often drawn from the lords . 
  baroness warsi is in the current cabinet and lord mandelson was in the last labour government 's cabinet . 
  i understand where you 're coming from , but how many people in the uk know how westminster actually works and how to affect it ? 
  just look at the whole `` brown was not elected as prime minister '' thing a few years ago , for example . 
  right-alt + 4 works on most en-gb keyboards i 've encountered . 
  the old ( er ) vote more , which is a problem . 
  berlusconi controls a huge segment of the media . 
  network neutrality & repeal of the data retention directive, 
   esa is not an eu institution . 
  the plan is to make it one by next year , though . 
  or they could just use brussels :p, 
  esa 's official languages are english , french and german . 
  so presumably a mix of those three . 
  i 'd love to see israel 's rap sheet on the `` good neighbourly relations '' criteria for accession . 
   anyone who is n't pc accepts that massive immigration from other continents is harder to integrate the uk had a huge indian/pakistani immigrant population ; they integrated very well imo . 
  i do n't think it would open up the doors to north african countries . 
  morocco was rejected awhile ago because it was african and not european . 
  although it is does have enhanced status with the eu that other na countries do not . 
   i said that gender plays a role in risk . 
  and the point of insurance is to pool risk . 
  if you over-fit your models to the data your ( the insurer 's ) profit may go up , but the overall benefit to your policyholders will go down . 
   some countries ( e.g. 
  uk ) have separate inheritance of the crown based on gender [ not for long ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20600543 ) :d, 
  from my own ( probably na\u00efve ) reasoning , businesses should pay women more , to act as an incentive to return to work after having a child . 
  childcare ( and children in general ) is expensive . 
   there are loads of court decisions ( which this is , not a law ) well , that depends . 
  in common law jurisdictions , case law is just as much law as statutes are . 
  big ben is n't square , it looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/big-ben-modern.jpg ), 
   the uk is very skewed towards london business wise . 
  it 's very skewed towards london full stop . 
  not uniquely belgian , though . 
  check out this [ pathetic motorway ] ( http://pathetic.org.uk/current/a57m/ ) ( yes , we have a website dedicated to `` pathetic motorways '' in the uk ) in my city :  ** what makes this a pathetic motorway ? 
  **  this is possibly the lowest standard dual carriageway motorway in the uk . 
  there are some at-grade junctions along some of its sliproads , there 's no hard shoulder along any of its length . 
   you can tell it was originally just plain a57 , and the ( m ) bit got tacked on later . 
   oh , and it has the most ridiculous piece of motorway in the country : an unfinished sliproad . 
   ** an unfinished sliproad ? 
  surely there 's plenty of those up and down the country ? 
  **  not like this one , there are n't . 
   ** what are you on about then ? 
  **  well , firstly it 's twenty feet up in the air when the sliproad suddenly stops . 
   ** and ? 
  **  you see , if it was finished , it would go the wrong way up a one-way street ... 
  now just think what [ jtrig ] ( https://theintercept.com/2015/06/22/controversial-gchq-unit-domestic-law-enforcement-propaganda/ ) can do as a highly funded and organised effort . 
   i personally hope he never sees the light of day again . 
  i 'm thankful it was an agent he was telling to bomb a crowd and not a real crazy . 
  tfa says that he managed to convince two people to go - armed - to an event who later shot a security guard and were themselves fatally shot by police . 
  do you have a source for that claim ? 
  12 is n't a [ perfect number ] ( https://oeis.org/a000396 ) . 
  besides , the flag was created before the eu was , so representing the perfection of the eu can not have been a factor in why the number was chosen . 
  exactly my point . 
   you 're the one who saw fit to mention it , presumably to show how unpatriotic you are no , i mentioned it because if you want to assert that something is the greatest ever , then there must be some metric by which you have to compare those things . 
  the was no metric offered - only ancestry - which is a problem as * nobody * has an unbroken lineage stemming from a single country ( except , perhaps , somebody who 's entire lineage has lived in the same modern country where the first homo sapien was born ) . 
  so logically , if ancestry is the only reason why one should consider a country great ( or the greatest ) then what happens if your ancestry is mixed ( as it is for * everyone * ) ? 
  that was the reason i mentioned it . 
   and as a reason you would n't defend our country . 
  i would n't defend any country * just because i was a citizen or considered it mine * , there would have to be other reasons . 
  the fact that i have an ancestor that was n't british has nothing to do with it . 
  in fact i rarely even think about it . 
  right , but / u/6million _ lampshades was saying that because i had a great grandparent that was n't , i 'm not `` fully '' british . 
  the number 12 was chosen precisely because it had no meaning .
