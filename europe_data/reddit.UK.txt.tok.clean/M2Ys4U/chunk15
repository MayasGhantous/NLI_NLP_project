   the uk is the country , ireland was a colony . 
  wessex and northumbria were united as england and the the uk . 
  so i should think that wessex and northumbria are also both the greatest in history because they 're part of the uk now ? 
  ( and presumably the other five kingdoms of the heptarchy too ? ), 
   if you would n't die for a country than you do n't deserve to live in it imo . 
  i would n't die for * any * country - where do i deserve to live ? 
  on a boat in international waters , perhaps ? 
   you say you 're not fully british , so i can understand your insecurity towards patriotism because it excludes you . 
  lol , what ? 
  i consider myself to be as british as anybody else . 
  i was born here , i 've lived here all my life . 
  go back far enough in your family tree and i guarantee that * at least * one of your ancestors was born somewhere other than the uk . 
  what it is is bizzare . 
  one of my great grandparents is swedish - should i have unconditional love for sweden ? 
  should i think that it 's * also * the greatest nation in history as well as the uk ? 
  or should it be number two ? 
  the uk used to include ireland - should i think that ireland is also the greatest nation in history ? 
  what about scotland ? 
  scotland has n't always been in the uk , how do i rank it ? 
  going back further , should i be more proud of the kingdom of wessex or of northumbria , given that i was born in what was the former and have adopted what was the latter as my home ? 
  having pride in one 's ancestors i can just about understand , but the leap to `` that makes my country * the greatest in history * '' is such a huge one that i ca n't see it . 
   i would ~ ~ think ~ ~ hope that everyone thinks that their nation is the greatest in history whether their british , german , venezuelan or sri lankan . 
  why ? 
  just because one is a citizen does n't mean that one also thinks their country is the best . 
  this attitude is * so * bizzare to me i ca n't even begin to comprehend it . 
  it 's a common meme amongst europhobes - `` more than the star on somebody else ' flag '' etc. 
  where is efa ? 
  i ask because the snp and plaid cymru in the uk have 59 mps and they do n't seem represented here . 
  the rule of law ... except when the government thinks you might be bad and then we 'll throw due process out of the window but trust us , we 're the good guys . 
   i know see why the eu and others are hq 'd there . 
  well belgium became the headquarters of the eu [ partly because its name starts with the letter b ] ( https://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/pvp_june_2014.pdf ) , and was thus first alphabetically . 
   this will either go well , very well or not that well , but that decision is now up to the catalan people '' wow , that 's some truly insightful commentary there . 
  genocide was committed in both wars , though . 
   europe is mostly ruled by a political and economic elite , ai n't it ? 
  where is n't ? 
  they do n't have to be consciously aware of that for it not to be a tax on stupidity . 
  oh , * that 's * what you mean by `` receipt '' . 
  in en-gb that 's usually called a bill or an invoice . 
  a receipt is proof of payment issued * after * you have handed the money over . 
   it 's a tax on stupidity . 
  only if you assume the only gain for the player is actually winning . 
  the anticipation of the draw is also part of the utility of buying a lottery ticket . 
  it 's one of the reasons so many people get addicted to gambling - not because they 're stupid , but because they get a sort of high from the act of gambling . 
  humans are creatures of habit . 
  once we have started habitually doing something we * tend * to keep doing it . 
  santos/mcgarry all the way . 
  the uk exit poll was pretty accurate , though . 
   it 's not the same at all , the guardian pay people , not very much , but they pay people for their comment pieces afaik , the guardian does * not * pay for cif columns . 
   looked at one way you could say this is fundamentally why you do n't give the ep the right of legislative initiative - because parliamentarians propose things in line with their political stance , and there are some pretty extreme stances in the ep . 
  as a counter-point , one could say that if you * did * give the ep the right of initiative , people would have to think twice about electing extremists . 
  plenty of * olive * oil , but that 's probably not what they 're after . 
  no it ca n't . 
  the eu is not a sovereign entity , it only has legal personality by way of international treaty and its powers are defined in those treaties . 
   there is no mechanism to suspend eu membership . 
  yes there is : [ article 7 of the treaty on european union ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_european_union/title_i:_common_provisions#article_7 ) . 
  while it 's not suspension of membership per se , the european council `` may decide to suspend certain [ ... ] rights deriving from the application of the treaties to the member state in question , including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that member state in the council . '', 
  well there are levels of decriminalisation . 
  decriminalisation of use/possession is different from decriminalisation of distribution/creation . 
  and both are different from legalisation . 
  fta :  pes activists , who were instrumental during the campaign of socialist spitzenkandidat martin schulz , have launched a petition for the election of enrique bar\u00f3n crespo to replace sergei stanishev as president of the centre-left european political family . 
  100 is a tiny sample size , and pollsters choose their samples and weight them so they are representative of the population as a whole . 
  not to mention that polls from different polling companies have been producing comparable numbers which tells you this is unlikely to be somebody releasing dodgy stats . 
  i doubt it , support for remaining has been [ steadily ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wjykcc5.png ) [ growing ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wpfzhja.png ) since the start of the year . 
  well , there 's some doubt as to the legitimacy of that transaction, 
   only if you include drugs & hookers . 
  to be honest , the sale of drugs and the sex industry * are * part of the economy , even if parts of it are illegal . 
   and most importantly , irish data laws are some of the most ` business friendly ' in europe - low tax is not the only reason facebook and apple etc have huge data centres here . 
  partly because the irish data protection commission is ridiculously under-resourced for the scale of the work it has to do . 
  just look at [ their office ] ( http://www.gutjahr.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/data-protection-commission1.jpg ) for instance . 
  they 're supposed to police facebook , microsoft , apple et . 
  from there ? 
  in england and wales : * new year 's day * good friday * easter monday * may day ( first monday in may ) * spring bank holiday ( last monday in may ) * late summer bank holiday ( last monday in august ) * christmas day * boxing day ( 26 ^ th december ) if christmas falls on a saturday or a sunday then the 27 ^ th is also given as a public holiday , and if boxing day falls on a saturday or sunday then the 28 ^ th is given as an public holiday . 
  northern ireland gets two extra public holidays : * st. patrick 's day ( 17 ^ th march ) * orangeman 's day ( 12 ^ th june ) scotland has [ a different system entirely ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_and_bank_holidays_in_scotland ) , based on local authorities . 
  well it 's a decent [ network between members of the european broadcasting union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurovision_%28network%29 ) allowing them to share news and coverage of sporting events . 
  as for the song contest broadcast on that network , for me it 's an excuse to gather with friends , get drunk and enjoy some kitsch singing and dancing . 
   why ? 
  it 's good to compare , since it shows a picture of the domestic market exactly that - it shows a picture of the * domestic * market but it fails to show a picture of the * size * of an economy which is my point . 
   even in terms of nominal gdp , china is still predicted to overtake the us in the future . 
  in the future , probably . 
  but not for a while yet . 
  even in 2020 the imf predicts they 'll still be $ 5.5 trillion dollars behind ( compared with $ 7 trillion in 2014 ), 
   china is predicted to become the largest world economy by nominal gdp , it 's already largest by ppp gdp . 
  it does n't make any sense to compare the size of economies by ppp, 
  pretty good performance as well, 
   i actually like ours , the german one and the one from the uk and all of them got nill . 
  spain and the uk got some votes , only germany ( and austria ) ended up with nil points . 
  right back at you , my german friend !, 
  i actually ca n't believe france got * any * votes tonight . 
  worst entry in the competition imho . 
  fair enough . 
  you mean like the [ eurobarometer polls ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb_arch_en.htm ) ? 
   42 % is not really a majority perhaps not an outright majority , but it is a plurality . 
  well there 's the [ eurobarometer poll ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_anx_en.pdf ) ( page 73 ) where 41 % of eu respondents said they agreed with the statement that `` the eu should develop further into a federation of nation states '' vs 34 % who said they disagreed ( with 25 % undecided ) . 
   for basically everything uk is the least supportive of further integration actually if you look at the eb poll for the statement `` the eu should develop further into a federation of nation states '' then sweden , finland and denmark are the member states where more respondents said they disagreed . 
  ( 74 % vs the uk 's 48 % ), 
   a french will never feel italian , spaniard or - definitely not - briton . 
  and those are our closest neighbor . 
  ah , but most italians , spainiads * and * britons do feel `` european '' ( at least in addition to their national identities ) . 
   the eu is anti-democratic in my opinion why do you think that ? 
  the trend has certainly been towards greater democracy over time - just look at the lisbon treaty .
