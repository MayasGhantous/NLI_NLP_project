  that gave parliament a * lot * more power . 
   further integration is starting to require countries to give up parts of their sovereignty , something that most will be very apprehensive about doing . 
  this has always been true , though . 
  even back in 1962 the ecj said this :  the community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights , albeit within limited fields and the subjects of which comprise not only member states but also their nationals . 
  that said , i largely agree with you . 
   its mostly how the political parties work . 
  there are no european parties . 
  well that 's not true . 
  political parties * do * exist at the european level ( they can be associations of national parties , member-based organisations or a mixture of both ) . 
  the epp , pes , egp , efa , aecr etc. 
  are all european political parties . 
  what you 're describing is more the groups in the european parliament which , while they are heavily linked to european political parties , are distinct and less formal . 
  the two largest european political parties run their own groups because they are so large ( epp/epp , pes/s & d ) . 
  alde and the greens/efa are effectively two groups that consists of two parties each plus some extras , and the others have no real europarty backing . 
  you could distribute the money in a digressively proportionate manner , like the number of meps each country gets . 
   the more centralized is something it is easier to lobby for something while true , it 's also relatively easy to play smaller independent countries against each other . 
   they are presented to the candidates at the end of a council election count . 
  i ran for council at the same time as him ( in a different area ) and they placed the half-dozen rejected ballots on the table in front of us when the count was completed for our ward . 
  yeah , i know the procedure as well ; i was a candidate at the european parliament elections in 2014 and i 've been an agent for local elections as well . 
  my point ( although i think i may have been a little ambiguous ) was that candidates/agents do n't have to review rejected ballots if they do n't want to . 
  the returning/counting officers do have to present the rejected ballots to the candidates/agents for review , though . 
  if it were the case that candidates/agents * had * to review the rejected ballots before the result was announced then that would give an effective veto to those that disliked the result by just not doing so . 
   another possibility is that there was an issue during verification ( a separate part of the process ) and a bundle of 100 votes has been mislaid , amongst which all of the tusc votes are contained . 
  this could be because a ballot box from his polling station was mishandled , but probably would n't be down to any kind of fraud ( it 's difficult to see why someone would deliberately mislay a single bundle ) . 
  well the point of verification is so that the number of ballots verified , number of ballots counted for each candidate ( + rejections ) , and the number of votes cast as recoded at the polling stations match so it would seem rather odd that a bundle would be mislaid as that would mean those totals would n't match . 
   actually rejected ballots have to be reviewed by the candidates as far as i 'm aware , so he would have kicked up a fuss if he had noticed his own slip in that pile . 
  no , they * can * be reviewed by candidates ( and agents ) but they do n't * have * to be . 
  this is ( one of the many ) reason ( s ) you should join your local pirate party . 
   the reason people say the eu is undemocratic is because the european parliament ( who people vote for ) is almost entirely irrelevant . 
  it * used * to be irrelevant . 
  it is n't any more . 
  it 's a full co-legislator ( together with the council of the european union ) and elects the president of the european commission . 
  he said he 'd resign if he lost his seat , which to many people does n't mean `` i 'll take a few months off '' . 
  we also have the world 's second largest chamber by membership as well , the house of lords . 
   here 's their * manicfesto * if you 're interested . 
  ftfy, 
  av is * not * a proportional system , though . 
   split england into 5-6 states [ heptarchy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heptarchy ) ftw !, 
   greens 3.8 % , seats 1 ; snp 5 % , seats 56 ; ukip 12.5 % , seats 1 ; tories 35 % , seats 320 + . 
  if you look at the average number of votes for candidates in each of the parties , you see why they failed to get more seats under fptp : greens : 2152 ; snp : 24,651 ; ukip : 6220 ; tories : 17,466 . 
  consisting mostly of ex-bnp types . 
  the bnp only stood 8 candidates this election - that 's how far they 've fallen . 
  on average , they only got 208 votes per candidate . 
  as i understand it , strong union negotiations on wages . 
  nah , that was just down to politics and public perception . 
  he was advised not to `` do god '' because it would turn off the electorate . 
  there 's no law about being religious and being pm . 
  basically , he wants to make any religious motivation an aggravating factor for more crimes . 
   you ca n't be a catholic and prime minister sure you can , you just ca n't be catholic and be the king or queen . 
  i voted for the pirate party ( in the general election ) and the green party ( in the local election ), 
   yes - that is only important question - who is `` we '' ? 
  that 's the `` demos '' in democracy - and the german constitutional court ruled it was the nation , not the eu that 's a reasonable argument , but as noted in the article it 's a largely subjective issue . 
  the latest eurobarometer study ( autumn 2014 ) has 63 % of those polled saying that they felt like an eu citizen and only in three of the 28 member states of the eu do more respondents say they do n't feel like an eu citizen than do ( greece , italy , bulgaria ) . 
  in fact if you ask whether somebody thinks of themselves as '' ( nationality ) only '' , '' ( nationality ) and european '' or `` european and ( nationality ) '' the results break down as 36 % , 51 % and 6 % respectively . 
  the german federal constitutional court also has a vested interest in member states ( and their respective constitutions ) retaining ultimate sovereignty as that is , after all , where their authority comes from . 
  tl ; dr : that 's a relatively persuasive argument , but i think it 's still up for debate . 
  that depends on how you define `` we '' , and it 's 9.7 % actually ( 73/751 ) . 
  nobody gets to vote for more than 0.15 % ( 1/650 ) of the total number of representatives at westminster . 
  whereas in the european parliament one 's vote affects between 0.40 % ( 3/751 ) and 1.33 % ( 10/751 ) of the representatives depending on the constituency . 
  voting for representatives that pass laws - and that would n't change in a federalised eu ; we already elect meps to pass legislation . 
  probably so they can provide a voiceover in different languages while using the same video, 
   my point is that a country does n't have to be in the europe in order to join the eu . 
  that 's literally one of the criteria !, 
  banking union ! = the euro, 
  it makes sense to use dollars considering that the us dollar is the worlds foremost reserve currency but the use of gallons is odd . 
   i thought reddit said surveillance does n't work to stop attacks . 
  `` an algerian man was arrested on sunday over the alleged plan , after he apparently shot himself by accident and called an ambulance . '', 
  does `` hospitals calling the police when people shoot themselves '' constitute mass surveillance, 
  there 's a debian distro called '' [ debianparl ] ( https://wiki.debian.org/debianparl ) '' which is [ used by the greens/efa group ] ( https://wiki.debian.org/debianparl/greensefa ) in the european parliament . 
   - edit - i honestly do n't understand the downvotes . 
  this literally is how discussions about federalization go here . 
  perhaps because they disagree that it 's a * legitimate * argument , even if it is the # 1 argument used . 
   i searched for this story in the uk press but could not find any references to it . 
  which are ? 
  that would make them privateers, 
   where is the ss when you really need it ? 
  careful now !, 
   you say this despite labour specifically saying they wo n't have a referendum ? 
  doubt the greens nor libdem would offer one either . 
  did you not watch bennett 's answer on that ? 
  the greens would offer a referendum but campaign to stay in the eu . 
  there are few restrictions on registering a party and getting on the ballot in the uk as well . 
  some us states have extra restrictions for parties that are n't the republicans or democrats that are insane . 
   capitalizing like this should be illegal in every language , in every country . 
  in regular prose , i agree . 
  however , in titles it 's perfectly fine - in fact it 's even called [ title case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letter_case#title_case ) . 
  ah , that would explain it . 
  still weird , though , i wonder if it 's an attempt at seo . 
  ** that 's ** some weird ** emphasis ** in that article . 
  it ** seems ** like they 're ** just ** highlighting random words ** throughout ** the article for no apparent ** reason ** . 
   if you want uk citizenship for example you also need to renounce any exiting citizenship . 
  i 'm certain that 's not true . 
  one just has to qualify for citizenship , the conditions of which are laid out in [ schedule 1 of the british nationality act 1981 ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/schedule/1 ) . 
  edit : in fact , the act has a loophole * specifically * so british citizens can obtain dual nationalities . 
  you can renounce your british citizenship and then resume it . 
  see [ sections 12 and 13 ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/part/i/crossheading/renunciation-and-resumption ) of the act . 
  i think both work . 
  `` thawing '' sounds like a longer process , `` unfeezing '' sounds more like an atomic action . 
  i said * main * driving force , not * only * . 
  price does factor in to it , but it 's not the main reason people create copies without the copyright owner 's permission .
