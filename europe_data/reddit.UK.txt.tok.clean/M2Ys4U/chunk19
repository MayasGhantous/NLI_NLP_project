   also , the # 350m fact was correct . 
  the uk has 0 control of how much it gets back in the rebate . 
  that 's not true . 
  the rebate is included in the multi-annual financial framework , over which we have a veto . 
   we give the eu # 350m and have no say in what they do with it . 
  again , wrong . 
  the rebate is deducted before we send the money , and as i said above we have a veto over the mff . 
  not to mention we vote on the budget in the usual manner . 
   i 'm pretty sure norway still contributes 70 % of what they would if they were full members and almost as much per capita as the uk with our rebate . 
   as we are seeing , it is hard to leave !, 
  it 's _ legally _ easy to leave , it 's the internal politics of member states that makes it hard ( which imho is a _ good _ thing ), 
  the european parliament will do just that once it is signed by the eu and its member states . 
  the ep voting no is what killed acta so there 's a very real possibility of them stopping ttip . 
  2014 was only the 8th election to the european parliament , and it only really became a full co-legislator ( along with the council ) in 2009 with the entry in to force of the lisbon treaty . 
  2014 was also the first time that the new rules regarding the ( s ) election of the commission were used . 
  what was old is new again, 
  a similar thing exists with the european patent office/organisation , weirdly enough :  the authorities of the states in which the organisation has its premises shall not enter those premises , except with the consent of the president of the european patent office . 
  such consent shall be assumed in case of fire or other disaster requiring prompt protective action .

  sounds like a pretty good life tbh, 
   the satellites already in orbit will allow the european commission to declare the start of initial services , expected towards year 's end . 
  the technical difficulties did an episode of citation needed about him : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsegt841pw, 
  as far as unemployment goes , [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/89/unemployment_rates_eu-28_ea-19_us_and_japan_seasonally_adjusted_january_2000_march_2017.png ) is a good graph showing the ea19 , eu28 , usa , and japan . 
  the eurozone is now back to where it was in q4 2008 , but it 's on a steady downwards trajectory . 
  doing research for the sake of research is a worthy effort as well , imo . 
  you never know what interesting or revolutionary technology will come out of the process as a side-effect . 
  sweden is a member of the eu ... 
   determinism does n't work with quantum mechanics . 
  well , not according to current theory anyway . 
  dat pope . 
   rights ! = law . 
  well , the udhr is not a law by any meaningful definition of the word . 
  besides , rights , both positive and negative , stem from the existence of law . 
  what is a right if one can not exercise it ? 
    what other `` actual '' rights does privacy stem from iyo ? 
   deontologically justifiable ones . 
  talking philosophy here , y' know ? 
  such as ? 
  and if you could cut out the condescension in your reply all the better . 
    what happens when two absolutes are diametrically opposed to each other ? 
   as i say , the idea of a `` right to privacy '' is invented nonsense , so there is no right which does oppose the right to freedom of expression . 
  the whole concept of a right is an invented one . 
  there is no supernatural imposition of rights upon humanity . 
    there is also the right to a privacy  is there ? 
  where does that right stem from ? 
  i would argue that privacy is an incidental occurrence , the possibility of which stems from other , actual rights . 
  well in modern times we have [ article 12 of the universal declaration of human rights ] ( https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a12 ) and article 8 of the [ convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms ] ( http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/treaties/html/005.htm ) ( aka the european convention on human rights ) , but case law on this ( in the uk ) goes back to at least 1774 . 
  what other `` actual '' rights does privacy stem from iyo ? 
    there has to be some sort of compromise . 
   you ca n't compromise on absolutes , you either have them or you fold . 
  what happens when two absolutes are diametrically opposed to each other ? 
  freedom of speech/expression is not the only human right , though . 
  there is also the right to a privacy , and the two rights can often be in conflict . 
  there has to be some sort of compromise . 
  well , from 2014 the ep will `` elect '' the commission president . 
  although , that is on advice of the council who has to `` take in to account '' the results of the european elections . 
  we 're getting there , albeit slowly . 
  the problem is that the negotiations happen in absolute secrecy . 
  same with acta , and same with the eu-india fta . 
  this shit wo n't stop until we demand that all of these treaties are negotiated in the open . 
  i doubt ceta will go through , at least if the negotiators keep bragging that they managed to get the digital chapter from acta put in there . 
  unfortunately not . 
  however , i do n't see why britain should leave because of that . 
  we should use new treaties to push for more competencies for the european parliament rather than taking our ball and going home in a sulk . 
  i retort with :  we must build a kind of united states of europe . 
  - * winston churchill *, 
   anybody in the cabinet has to be elected as an mp by the people . 
  not true , lord mandelson was a minister in the previous government and he was not an elected member of parliament , lord strathclyde is a member of this government 's cabinet , as is baroness warsi . 
   my argument is pretty simple , we the people of the united kingdom have control over our government and parliament . 
  yes the pm or his cabinet are not directly elected by us , but they are all accountable to the house of common and in turn us . 
   this is not the way it works in the eu . 
  meps have only so much power . 
  the government has a built-in majority of the commons . 
  this is n't exactly a good way to ensure accountability . 
  the only real way that the government is accountable is through a vote of no confidence , but the ep has that over the commission too . 
  the ep has to pass the legislation , as does the council . 
  if either vote no , the legislation is blocked and goes back to the commission . 
   i do think we need to finally put the issue to rest though . 
  we need to decide , once and for all , what we want our relationship with europe to be . 
  indeed . 
  i want a referendum and i 'd definitely be voting to stay in the eu . 
  unfortunately , the debate at the moment is dominated by europhobes and a lot of misinformation . 
  taxing electricity use is regressive , though . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm saying '' [ some ] people want it '' is not a sufficient argument . 
  some people want to bring back hanging . 
  does n't mean we should do it . 
  because it wo n't keep everybody happy , it 's discrimination based on sexual orientation . 
   nobody likes to give up national sovereignty , least of all , it seems , politicians on the left . 
  hmm , really ? 
  in the uk it 's the right who are europhobes ... 
   out of curiosity i 'm wondering how effective the energy one would would be for the uk , we live on an island so i 'm not sure how feasible it is to get electricity into the country in amounts which make it viable to sell ? 
  well , edf is already a big ` supplier ' of energy in the uk ... 
  sinn fein 's representatives elected to westminster ca n't take a salary or claim expenses because they have not taken the oath ( or solemn pledge ) which all mps must do . 
   if it really harms the business , then all businesses wont do it consistently . 
  since they do , it does not harm them . 
  businesses are made up of people , and people are not always rational . 
  there are a metric boat load of examples of people acting against their own interests . 
  we need better ( and more affordable ) provision for childcare , and promote the idea of paternity leave in addition to maternity leave .
