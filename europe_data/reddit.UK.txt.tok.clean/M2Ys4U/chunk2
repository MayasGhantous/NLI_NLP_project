  in some areas , though , parliament is the body that has the sole right to initiate legislation ( for instance , around elections to parliament ) . 
   so why are they more democratic than the uk parliament ? 
  because you like the system they are elected in ? 
  i gave you a list in my previous comment . 
   the european parliament did not select him . 
  they approved him . 
  article 17 ( 7 ) of the treaty on european union :  taking into account the elections to the european parliament and after having held the appropriate consultations , the european council , acting by a qualified majority , shall propose to the european parliament a candidate for president of the commission . 
  ** this candidate shall be elected by the european parliament by a majority of its component members . 
  ** if he does not obtain the required majority , the european council , acting by a qualified majority , shall within one month propose a new candidate who shall be elected by the european parliament following the same procedure . 
  ( emphasis mine ) why was it junker who got the job ? 
  because the european parliament demanded that he be given the first chance at being elected . 
  many heads of government in the european council did n't want him , but they all ( with the exception on cameron ) saw the writing on the wall and did n't want to have a battle with parliament . 
   and more democratic than the uk system ? 
  yes . 
  elections to parliament are done using proportional representation , the head of government ( i.e. 
  the european commission president ) is elected by parliament , the entire cabinet ( i.e. 
  the college of european commissioners ) has to be approved by parliament . 
  the upper chamber consists of members of the government of the member states . 
  the legislature is independent of the executive . 
  to contrast that with the uk : elections to parliament are done using first past the post , the head of government is invited and appointed by the reigning monarch . 
  the head of government has complete discretion over his or her cabinet . 
  the upper chamber consists of members of the official state religion , people who are there by birthright , and people who have been appointed for life by the government ( or previous governments ) . 
  the legislature is dominated by the executive . 
  which of those sounds more democratic to you ? 
   the only direcly elected eu institution has no power to remove or create legislation . 
  so why is that democratic ? 
  i did say that there 's room for improvement ; the legislature should have the right of initiative . 
   european commission presidents are appointed by a qmv of the heads of state of the member states not any more . 
  the european council * proposes * and the european parliament * elects * the president of the european commission . 
   it is undemocratic while there 's certainly room for improvement , it 's * more * democratic than the british political system . 
   who elected juncker ? 
  the members of the european parliament . 
  if you actually look at the data , though , there 's no statistically significant impact on `` native '' employment rates as a result of immigration ( from the eea ) . 
  a recent uk poll said that more than 50 % of people think that uk citizens should be able to live and work in the eu but only roughly 30 % think that eu citizens should be able to live and work in the uk . 
  a couple of members of the greens/efa group have offered an invitation for any on the more left-wing part of m5s to join them . 
  they do n't just abstain from voting they abstain from even taking their seats . 
  the eu has approved the uk spending funds to build the plant , as they have to because it falls under the definition of ` state aid ' , which is largely prohibited by the eu treaties . 
  in fact , the agreement was modified because it needed eu approval , and the uk government got a ( slightly ) better deal out of it . 
   the real global issue here is the billion chinese people who are now climbing out of poverty and the billion people who still burn wood around the world who desperately want to do the same . 
  not that i have any idea on the investment that is likely or occurring now , but is it not possible that relatively-more-developed developing countries ( like china ) will leapfrog us when it comes to building the required infrastructure as happens with manufacturing ? 
  in other words , we iterated and have legacy dirty infrastructure left over , ca n't they use clean ( er ) infrastructure to provide their power needs as they are effectively building from scratch ? 
  i would 've thought that europa would be the ideal place for an eu mission :p, 
  also why the chocolate tastes so bad ; if they used the same formulae that we do in europe it would either all melt before it reached the consumer or it 'd cost too much to transport and store, 
  before the common era, 
  highest ever turnout in a national ballot . 
   oh really ? 
  is that obvious ? 
  so gay people , brown people , black people , women , transgender people , immigrants are actually worth more than a regular middle aged white dude with no strong ideological leanigs ? 
  attacking them is a more serious crime ? 
  what about nerdly looking teenagers ? 
  what if some punks attack a bunch of neo-nazis ? 
  does n't that sound like a `` hate crime '' ? 
  the police here have started [ recognising hate crimes against alternative subcultures ] ( http://www.gmp.police.uk/content/websitepages/bce5cbfba182f06380257b43002a81e5?opendocument ) following the fatal beating of a woman and her boyfriend for being goths , so yes the definition of hate crime is very broad . 
  it 's not about people being `` worth more '' , it 's about the motivation behind the crime . 
  if a particular prejudice against a group is an aggravating factor in the commission of the crime then it should be punished more harshly . 
  i assume it 's this interview : http://www.channel4.com/news/finnish-pm-i-dont-recognise-british-image-of-eu-video, 
     the whole second paragraph lists exceptions to the free distribution on information , including national security . 
  i doubt many of the major eu countries are currently publishing full disclosure of their interactions with foreign intelligence agencies , or will do so in the event of the echr ruling that they should . 
  the exception has to check all of the boxes , though , so it has to be necessary in a democratic society ** and ** prescribed by law ** and ** be in the interests of national security . 
   this really is the case , they 've done the hardwork for the mainstream politicials by highlighting the flaws , but retard themselves but proposing awful situations . 
  they have also shifted the overton window towards those awful `` solutions '' , though :(, 
   a parliament that was n't officially in any country would be interesting , though probably unworkable . 
  so like the usa then , with washington dc not being a state but run directly by congress ? 
  the brigading does n't help, 
  there 's no way that the entire north of england would be called yorkshire . 
  not on * this * side of the pennines anyway , 
   the official position is that allowing duplicate flags , or even a permanently visible text books ( as in / r/ukpolitics ) would make the sub look too confusing and messy . 
  we do , however , provide the option to have taxt of your choice which is visible upon mouse-hover . 
  how about a compromise and show the flair text in-line , but only on mouseover ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i 've seen a couple of subreddits do this and it 's quite nice ( also more discoverable ), 
   i have a 1200w vacuum cleaner i love it . 
  hands off it , eu !!!, 
  you 're not going to have europol break down your door , handcuff you and cart your vacuum cleaner away . 
  it 's just that * new * ones wo n't be able to be sold any more . 
  well spotted !, 
  looking at reddit metrics , the only geographical subreddit that has more subscribers is / r/murica , and that 's satirical . 
   it 's usually only broadcast on bbc parliament and bbc radio , but if there 's anything particularly noteworthy than it will be shown on the main news bulletins . 
  it 's shown on bbc one as well ( as part of the daily politics show ), 
  not necessarily . 
  i thought that was our job ? 
  a venn diagram has * all * of the circles overlapping , whereas a [ euler diagram ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euler_diagram ) does not . 
   they merely pass it along for the agency designed to deal with foreign threats : the cia . 
  in fact an internal slogan for the partnership in the nsa is `` we track 'em you whack 'em '' which tells you a lot about the mindset ... 
   plus they are cutting the amount of full-time soldiers and want to rely a bit more on the ta ( kind of like army reserves in the us i think ) which is also an idea i do n't think is great . 
  the ta is now officially the `` army reserves '' , the change happened in the last 2 or 3 years . 
  ` freedom ' is a little broad , but if i understand your meaning then no , it 's a civil right not a human right . 
  british terrorism legislation is inherently political - to charge somebody with a terrorism offence ( conducted outside the country ) requires the permission of a politician , namely the attorney general . 
  commissioners are nominated by national * executives * , rather than legislatures . 
  i suppose that the legislatures could do it , but the executives do n't want to give up any power . 
  and , as with the potec nomination , the parliament has a significant say over the appointment of the commission as well - they have to assent to the entire college of commissioners . 
  and parliament wants there to be a gender balance , which is probably why juncker is going so hard on this . 
  membership is the long-term goal . 
  but it 's not going to happen in the short - to medium-term . 
  human rights apply to * everyone * . 
  end of story . 
  it does n't matter * what * they have done . 
  at all . 
  that 's the * entire point * of human rights . 
  south america is n't very close to geographical europe , but part of it ( french guiana ) is in the eu ... 
   tricky .
