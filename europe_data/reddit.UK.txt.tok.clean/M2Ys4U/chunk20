  i guess that depends on how the debt is shared between the two resultant states . 
   it has to be asked why the proposed currency zone between new zealand and australia - which have far more similar economies , the same language , legal system and freedom of movement/employment like shengen - was laughed at by new zealand and australian economists and politicians . 
  because it is n't needed , floating currencies do work and they are intimately tied to democracy . 
  well , i do n't think you can compare the two that well . 
  first of all , a two-state currency bloc is quite a bit different from a 17-state currency bloc . 
  secondly , and this is tied to point # 1 , there 's a disparity between the size of the two states . 
  nz has a gdp of $ 161.9 billion , australia has a gdp of $ 914.5 billion . 
  in europe , any disparity between individual states is offset by the fact that there are 15 other states involved . 
  thirdly , the eu , and by extension the eurozone , has a common aquis ( body of law ) which , i would argue , is more important than a common legal system . 
  the pirate party is not a one-issue party , though ... 
  at a european conference of pirates over the weekend in barcelona , i was under the impression that ppnl were looking at getting a seat , perhaps 2 if something big hit . 
   the right-wing , scandal-tinged former defence minister liam fox -- who was forced to resign last year after taking a friend on overseas trips -- ... that 's not the only ( or even biggest ) why he was forced to resign ... = = getting back to the point of the article ... as much as i hate to agree with blair , he has a point on this issue, 
   i understand the mentality that native people should be treated better because they built the country and all , but i do n't think that the government should treat one group better over another . 
  all `` native '' really means is that their predecessors immigrated to the country earlier . 
  there have been countless waves of immigration for millennia . 
  nation building does n't ever stop . 
  institutions rarely ever stay completely static or extant . 
  afaik most eu member states have their legislation in xml format , and there 's an xml interchange format called [ cen metalex ] ( http://www.metalex.eu/ ) . 
  the uk , for example , exposes this format on legislation.gov.uk , but whether most member states also * publish * in xml is another story . 
  it varies from school to school , i think at my school , french was compulsory from year 7 to year 9 . 
  for years 10 and 11 we had the option to switch to ( or also learn ) german for gcse or drop the languages entirely . 
  i believe spanish was also introduced the year after i went to college ( 2006 ) the rest of what you 've written was pretty accurate , though . 
  during my exchange trip , my host family and their friends wanted to practice their english with me , so i did n't really get a chance to practice my german . 
   in theory parliament could pass the necessary laws without a referendum , there 's no obligation for a referendum . 
  that 's no longer true . 
  the [ european union act 2011 ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/12/part/1/crossheading/restrictions-relating-to-amendments-of-teu-or-tfeu ) states that there must be a referendum before we ratify the new treaty if any of the following conditions are met :  ( a ) the extension of the objectives of the eu as set out in article 3 of teu ;   ( b ) the conferring on the eu of a new exclusive competence ;   ( c ) the extension of an exclusive competence of the eu ;   ( d ) the conferring on the eu of a new competence shared with the member states ;   ( e ) the extension of any competence of the eu that is shared with the member states ;   ( f ) the extension of the competence of the eu in relation to --    1 . the co-ordination of economic and employment policies , or   2 . common foreign and security policy ;   ( g ) the conferring on the eu of a new competence to carry out actions to support , co-ordinate or supplement the actions of member states ;   ( h ) the extension of a supporting , co-ordinating or supplementing competence of the eu ;   ( i ) the conferring on an eu institution or body of power to impose a requirement or obligation on the united kingdom , or the removal of any limitation on any such power of an eu institution or body ;   ( j ) the conferring on an eu institution or body of new or extended power to impose sanctions on the united kingdom ;   ( k ) any amendment of a provision listed in schedule 1 that removes a requirement that anything should be done unanimously , by consensus or by common accord ;   ( l ) any amendment of article 31 ( 2 ) of teu ( decisions relating to common foreign and security policy to which qualified majority voting applies ) that removes or amends the provision enabling a member of the council to oppose the adoption of a decision to be taken by qualified majority voting ;   ( m ) any amendment of any of the provisions specified in subsection ( 3 ) that removes or amends the provision enabling a member of the council , in relation to a draft legislative act , to ensure the suspension of the ordinary legislative procedure . 
   but the claim that the protest of the pirate party has ( majorly ) caused that is wrong in my opinion . 
  also the claim that the initiated the protest is not right . 
  that 's not the claim being made here , to be honest . 
  only the germans :p, 
  amelia andersdotter , pirate mep from sweden , was the rappourteur for the inte committee which recommended rejection . 
  amelia and her pirate colleague christian engstrom mep did a lot of campaigning inside the european parliament . 
  the parliament must give its consent , which means acta is dead . 
  there was an ep debate on the 19th april , which is what i 'm relying on . 
  not sure if non-uk people can access it , but the bbc 's democracy live [ has the video ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/europe/newsid_9709000/9709051.stm ), 
  arguably the eu already has a constitution in the form of the treaty on european union and the treaty on the functioning of the european union much like the uk 's constitution is not a written document but a series of statutes and convention . 
  [ lawrence lessig 's talk ] ( http://vimeo.com/39188615 ) at orgcon 2012 touched on the issue of spectrum ownership vs licensing , it 's worth a watch . 
  i strongly disagree . 
  businesses should be regulated by law , you ca n't adopt a laissez-faire attitude in * all * markets otherwise the consumer ( and other businesses ) get boned . 
  which the lisbon treaty says we must do . 
  significant work on this has happened already but surprise surprise the uk government is frustrating the effort in the council of ministers :(, 
  one of the british constitution 's best points is that it 's very flexible . 
  one of its worst points is that it 's very flexible . 
  what 's wrong with the [ charter of fundamental rights of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union ) and the [ european convention on human rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_convention_on_human_rights ) ? 
   you should specify a peaceful procedure for exiting the union there already is one , it 's [ article 50 of the treaty on european union ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_european_union/title_vi:_final_provisions#article_50 ) , brought in by the lisbon treaty . 
  iirc the ep ca n't approve all but , say , one commissioner and be done with it , they have to reject the entire commission and let the commission president work it out . 
  of course is an ep committee rejects a single candidate then the president has enough wiggle-room to reshuffle before the ep as a whole votes . 
  and the electoral system . 
  the electoral college and use of the first past the post system are horrible ( oh how i wish we 'd abandon fptp in the uk ) . 
  lol . 
  copyright law is like an onion . 
  it has many layers and it will make you cry . 
  -- caroline wilson, 
  yes , but then that 's an element of the westminster system that 's in use all over the world , and it 's a feature of [ many other constitutions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_system ) too . 
  having a separately elected commission president could mean that that the executive and legislature have opposing mandates from the people resulting in a stalemate . 
  lots of other teams do too !, 
  so the way it is at the moment ( or , rather , from 2014 onwards ) is that the european parliament will elect somebody to be the commission president . 
  the commission president then appoints his or her commissioners who then have to be approved en-bloc by the european parliament . 
  what i 'm suggesting is that the european parliament would have to elect an mep to be commission president , and the rest would be the same . 
  i agree . 
  in general i think the presidential system is a bad idea . 
  i would much rather the commission consisted of meps rather than just being elected by them . 
   also as a recent article on the bbc showed you can have decreasing relative poverty because average wages are falling . 
  that 's a bit of perverse logic is ever there was one . 
  well , yeah . 
  hence why it 's ** relative ** poverty and not ** absolute ** poverty . 
  hmm , fair enough . 
  i do n't really think of the echr/european council as being `` integration '' to be honest , despite sharing an institution but i guess that 's just my view on things , 
   1 ) none at all . 
  this option is completely unrealistic , not least because even if you dissolve the eu completely , the european court of human rights would still exist . 
  i would n't recommend it even if it were potentially viable . 
  i 'm baffled as to why you brought the ecthr in to it at all , let alone saying that the dissolution of the eu would be unrealistic `` not least '' because it exists . 
  the echr has absolutely nothing to do with the eu , which i suspect you already know given what you posted , except that the lisbon treaty requires that the eu accede to the convention ( and guess which country is trying to frustrate that effort in the council of ministers ... ), 
  imho , one of the biggest impediments to effective ( by which i mean fair and democratic ) globalisation is the entrenchment of nation states . 
  global treaties , trade agreements and global policy formation take place at inter-governmental levels where there is little to no transparency or democratic involvement , a case in point being acta . 
  naturally we ca n't have referenda on the minutiae of trade agreements and the like but if we can make the boundaries between nation states more politically porous , maybe we can start to work around the deadlocks that can appear when national interests get in the way of realising improvements in citizens ' interests . 
   the very fact that we seem to all be falling into this union rather than willingly walking into it seems to only add weight to my fears . 
  it does n't help that there 's a lot of misinformation around either , from both euroskeptics and europhilles to varying degrees . 
   to be honest , this is making me increasingly uneasy . 
  i do n't think this will be democratic , nor will it be beneficial to my country / represent its interests in the slightest . 
  quite the opposite , in fact . 
  i agree about the democratic deficit ( is there anybody in europe who does n't ? ), 
  but as for national interests ... 
  i 'm not so sure . 
  there 's something to be said for deviating from a local maximum to try and find a global maximum . 
  here 's a [ crappy graph ] ( http://localhostr.com/files/zalut8d/crappy_eu_diagram.png ) to allow me to try and explain . 
  imagine that we 're at point 2 . 
  in the short term , more integration ( moving to point 3 ) may be against our immediate national interest , but if it is a stepping stone to point 4 then the long-term positives outweigh the short-term negatives . 
  however , some say that we should stick to the status quo ( point 2 ) or roll back integration ( `` take back powers from brussels !, 
  '' ; point 1 ) because it 's better than the apparent alternative ( point 3 ) . 
  of course , i 'm slightly talking out of my arse as i have no way to quantify these changes to place them on a graph like this ... it 's just my gut feeling and extrapolating from past benefits of integration . 
   the really important question : would a federal europe allow me to watch rai 's streams outside of italy and give me similar access to other eurozone states offerings ? 
  i believe you may alreadybe allowed under the [ electronic commerce directive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electronic_commerce_directive_%28eu%29 ) but ianal . 
  well , * i * want further european integration , on the condition that the eu is more democratised . 
  most people i 've talked to about the eu to have broadly similar views to mine . 
  the euroskeptics are just very loud . 
  ok , maybe not * just * very loud , there 's quite a few , but i would n't put them in the majority just yet . 
   [ t ] here was some contentious point about financing , not sure , perhaps european parties currently ca n't finance member parties election campaigns for european elections or something like that , and probably should to build a federal democratic space etc. 
  article 7 of `` the regulations governing political parties at european level and the rules regarding their funding '' ( ec 2004/2003 , as amended ) states that  the funding of political parties at european level from the general budget of the european union or from any other source may not be used for the direct or indirect funding of other political parties , and in particular national parties or candidates . 
  these national political parties and candidates shall continue to be governed by national rules .
