  however article 8 states  the expenditure of political parties at european level may also include financing campaigns conducted by the political parties at european level in the context of the elections to the european parliament , in which they participate as required in article 3 ( 1 ) ( d ) . 
  in accordance with article 7 , these appropriations shall not be used for the direct or indirect funding of national political parties or candidates . 
   such expenditure shall not be used to finance referenda campaigns . 
   however , in accordance with article 8 of the act concerning the election of the members of the european parliament by direct universal suffrage , the funding of and limitation of election expenses for all parties and candidates at european parliament elections is governed in each member state by national provision . 
  tl ; dr : europarties ** can ** finance national parties ' election campaigns in european parliament elections , providing the member state in question allows it under their own electoral law .

   i 've known three people illegible to vote sent polling cards somehow ( all international students ) were they eu students ? 
  eu citizens are eligible to vote in local and eu elections ( and maybe assembly elections too , but i 'm not sure ) . 
   thinking about it i 'm stunned that electoral fraud is n't more widespread !, 
  most fraud comes from postal ballots . 
  i do n't think i 've ever met anybody who even knows anybody else who speaks esperanto . 
   why did n't they sort that out when they decided to adopt the euro ? 
  i think it was assumed that at some point , it would either be a natural political evolution or some sort of crisis would force it to happen . 
  basically , they kicked the can down the road . 
  they won 18 seats in the state parliament in an election . 
  surely that constitutes an `` election win '' . 
  true to the nature of europe , we actually have two . 
  one celebrating the council of europe on the 5th of may and one celebrating the european union on the 9th of may . 
   google tells me  wiki tells me eurostat may well be wrong ( in fact i 'd bet on it ) but those are n't exactly the most reliable of sources . 
  agreed . 
  thanks to the lisbon treaty the next commission will be indirectly elected , by the european parliament . 
  it is a necessary and welcome , but insufficient , development . 
  imo the european parliament needs to be given the right to initiate legislation rather than merely requesting it from the commission . 
  unfortunately , attempts to democratise the eu institutions need treaty changes , and for that to happen the member states need to agree . 
  any treaty changes that happen soon will most likely include member states trying to claw back powers . 
  while a move away from fptp post is better than sticking with the status quo ( and i voted for the change to av ) , it would n't have really helped small parties like the pirate party win seats as it 's only very marginally more proportional than fptp . 
  i 'm still hopeful that elections to the house of lords ( if the change happens ) will use stv . 
  by accountable , i mean accountable to the citizens of the eu . 
  they 're accountable to the parliament which is a completely different kettle of fish . 
  you can not vote out the commissioners at the next election like you can with a traditional cabinet in , say , the westminster system . 
  personally i 'd like the commission to be drawn from the parliament itself rather than simply elected by them . 
  i completely agree . 
  however , at least now we have the lisbon treaty the commission will be * elected * by the european parliament and not * appointed * by the council so at least there 's a level of indirect democracy at work . 
  even so , the commission is unaccountable and having the exclusive right of initiative is troubling . 
  something like [ liquid democracy ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/liquid_democracy ) ? 
  ok , i admit i was being a little bit facetious with that comment , i do n't actually believe all eurosceptics are xenophobes . 
  i was playing to the stereotype . 
  we 're not * all * backwards xenophobes :d, 
  amelia anderstotter 's ( pirate mep ) aide has sent out an e-mail saying that this article is bs, 
  this is not true . 
  e-mail sent from the office of amelia anderstotter ( pirate party mep ) :  dear all  it has come to our attention via twitter that there seems to be some rumors that the european parliament automatically sends acta related mails to the spam bin . 
  as me and amelia is on the inside she suggested that i 'd let you all know that this is not true . 
   the mail that get sent to the meps are handled in microsoft outlook and the control over the spam filter in outloook is entirely in the hand of the individual mep . 
  the default setting for the spam filter is `` low '' and in that setting roughly somewhat less than 10 % of the acta related emails that was sent to amelias account got sent to the spam bin . 
  those mails were all identical and sent more or les at the same time which i probably why the spam filter reacted . 
   so , to sum it up : with the default settings a tiny minority of the acta-related emails got sent to the spam bin . 
  the control of the spam filter is in the hand of the individual mep . 
  if you take the time to actually write the email yourself and adressing the individual mep instead of mass sending emails to all meps at the same time your email do not risk being stuck in the spam filter at all regardless of the topic . 
   feel free to spread this information to anywone who 've expressed concerns regarding the spam filters in the parliament . 
   best regards  mab, 
  imho , the biggest part of the democratic deficit is the fact that citizens have no control over who initiates legislation . 
  the eu commission is the body that holds that power , and they 're nowhere near democratic . 
   for instance , i 'm british and would like to vote for the pirate party , but there is n't really a very good british equivalent . 
  you will almost certainly be able to vote for the [ pirate party uk ] ( http://pirateparty.org.uk ) at the next ep elections  if you want to help shape the the direction of ppuk , there 's a [ policy process ] ( http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2011/dec/21/policy-2012/ ) going on right now to expand the party 's platform ( the first stage of which was held [ right here on reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/policy2011/ ) ) . 
  mainstream economists have hardly come out of the last 4 years covered in glory . 
  technically this is n't a venn diagram , it 's a [ euler diagram ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euler_diagram ) . 
  eu election , maybe . 
  in the locals they got trounced , and lost almost all of their seats . 
  the whole point of supranational organisations like the eu is that the member states pool their sovereignty for the benefit of all member states . 
  so yes , it does mean `` giving up '' sovereignty , but that is n't necessarily a bad thing . 
  the issue is more of an emotional rather than practical argument , and at the end of the day a member state can invoke [ article 50 of the treaty of the european union ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_european_union/title_vi:_final_provisions#article_50 ) and leave if it so wishes . 
  that 's a pretty sovereign move to make . 
   germany and france should take the blame for this one , they broke the rules back when times were good - remember the stability and growth pact ? 
  greece too , they deliberately lies about their finances and hid their debt . 
  it 's sovereign fraud . 
   so long as we in the uk can stay out of it then sure , please go ahead and do so . 
  isolationism is n't going to help us . 
  we need to be part of the european project , not marginalising ourselves . 
  if we want to prosper long-term , we need to ( get | stay ) engaged . 
  i think that joining the euro is a good idea . 
  not * now * , though . 
  it was n't the eurozone that caused the crisis , and imo greece should not have been allowed to join the eurozone as it falsified its accounts . 
  the crisis would 've happened without the euro , although the usual fiscal measures to help alleviate it would 've made it less of an immediate clusterfuck . 
  what the current crisis shows is that if you share a common currency , stick to the god damn rules . 
  greece flat-out lied about its finances to join , and stay in , the euro . 
  although it is tough to maintain the currency if there is n't fiscal and political integration too . 
  something which the eurozone - and the union as a whole - should be pushing towards . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's still got to go through the ep formally , and ( possibly ) receive the consent of all member states . 
  there 's still some hope if we keep pestering them to boot acta into the long grass . 
  there are 23 official languages in the eu - and a plethora of other minority languages - which would pose a huge problem for a pan-eu tv station or similar . 
  imho , the problem is the last of democracy , transparency and accountability in the eu . 
  the parliament is all well and good , but it has hardly any power , the executive needs big reform . 
  fta :  but a better course would be for petulant britain to drop the attitude , admit its mistakes , humbly roll up its sleeves and re-engage with this european project , which is so crucial to the future of this 21st-century world . 
  congratulations , you 've just invented the world 's most expensive pencil . 
  in ( english ) cities with mayors and other areas with police and crime commissioners there 's [ supplementary voting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contingent_vote#supplementary_vote ) as well . 
  electronic voting is such a monumentally stupid idea i 'm surprised so many people are in favour of it . 
  the cjeu gave a judgment on questions referred to it by the court of appeal about the data retention and investigatory powers act 2014 , not the investigatory powers act 2016 . 
  it 'll take a new uk court case to invalidate the latter , and the court of appeal needs to re-start the proceedings on the former that were suspended pending the referral to the cjeu . 
  fax . 
  it 's amazing how many institutions still use faxes . 
   prisoners have a lot more rights here , a prominent one is the right to vote . 
  that 's only stripped here in serious cases of some very specific democracy-related crimes such as voting fraud . 
  that is ( in theory , anyway ) the case in most of europe - blanket bans on prisoners voting is contrary to article 3 of protocol 1 to the european convention on human rights . 
  see hirst v united kingdom for example .
