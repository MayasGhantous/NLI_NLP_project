  people are already going nuts over eu-canada free trade deal . 
  it 's not the fact that we 're doing a deal with canada , it 's the way in which the deal has been done and the specific details of the deal ( e.g. 
  isds ) that are the problems . 
  yeah , i realised that almost immediately , but decided to leave it there with the edit comment just because it 's interesting information . 
  edit : i think i may have misunderstood your point here . 
  oops . 
   it 's difficult to say which countries vote which way since there has n't really been that many elections yet , and many eu member states are new to the club . 
  in the european parliament meps generally vote more with their group than they do with colleagues from their own country , and moreso over time . 
  there are exceptions , of course , such as the british conservatives who voted more as a bloc within the epp , but this led to them leaving the epp and the eventual formation of the ecr . 
  and who exactly defines what is and is not a `` terrorist group '' ? 
  ( hint : the same person responsible for stripping somebody of their citizenship , the secretary of state ), 
   in the european parliament , there is no compulsory expression of alternate policy . 
  there is only the ruling coalition and no information on the opposition . 
  coalitions are formed around issues , rather than government-and-opposition . 
  frankly , i think it 's a better system . 
  it 's not opposition for the sake of opposition , like we get here in the uk . 
   secondly , we require all government ministers to be elected members of parliament , again a principle that the ep does not apply . 
  that 's not true , government ministers can come from the lords as well . 
   efficient means also quick reactions , not being blocked by nations ' self-interests this is an are where federalisation - as opposed to intergovernmentalism or supranationalism - would help . 
  we ( the pirate party uk ) used reddit back in 2011/2012 for [ policy proposals and debates ] ( / r/policy2011 ) ahead of the creation of our 2012 manifesto . 
  there 's a difference between getting a population as a whole to eat more fruit and having an individual eat more fruit , especially when you consider that some people may not eat enough fruit and vegetables in the first place . 
  they also contain other things ( e.g. 
  fibre ) that helps satiate us . 
  * eating * fruit is a lot better than drinking fruit juice or smoothies . 
  nice . 
  looks like not all of the questions are available , though :(, 
  it looks like it 's only available in pdf form , unfortunately . 
   since when are we comparable to bulgaria ? 
  well , both countries acceded to the union at the same time . 
   england has always been a bit detached from europe , maybe it 's because we are actually detached from europe . 
  any more detached than ireland ? 
  they only started asking this question in 2010 ( eb73 ) , and not even every time . 
  [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/trjyq4q.png ) is how the eu28 figures have evolved since then , but i do n't really feel like going back over 4 more reports typing out figures into libreoffice to create new graphs :p the raw data is available if you want to do it , though . 
  to the question  in general , does the eu conjure up for you a very positive , fairly positive , neutral , fairly negative or very negative image ? 
  the results break down as : * uk : 3 % very positive , 20 % fairly positive , 35 % neutral , 24 % fairly negative , 12 % very negative and 5 % do n't know . 
  * se : 4 % very positive , 38 % fairly positive , 29 % neutral , 25 % fairly negative , 4 % very negative and 0 % do n't know . 
  data from [ eurobarometer 81 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_first_en.pdf ) , polls taken between 31st may and 14th june 2014 . 
  indeed . 
  protecting human rights is not as simple as writing a declaration or charter , or even including them in domestic law or constitutions . 
  it 's an * ongoing * process , and often an unpalatable one . 
  defending the rights of people who have committed disgusting acts ( such as murder , sexual assault or child abuse ) is a very , very uncomfortable thing to do . 
  but it has to be done . 
  when somebody tries to take the human rights of those people away , what they 're doing is not just taking away * their * rights , but eroding the rights of * everybody * , including the very best of us . 
  the udhr is n't legally binding , though . 
  if you can not invoke a right , is it really a right ? 
  the whole idea of human rights is that they apply to * all * humans , and they ca n't be taken away - they are unalienable . 
  there is pressure for that to change , though . 
  some judges there only have french as a * fifth * language . 
  i 'd rather have moderators that will be good at the job rather than appoint ones that merely tick all of the boxes ... 
  europe did n't kick cameron in the balls , he purposefully dropped his own crotch on europe 's stationary leg from a great height . 
  he knew what he was doing was anti-democratic , and he knew he was going to fail , and fail badly . 
  the only reason it played out the way it did was so that he appear to be doing something to the eurosceptics back in britain who thought that a spitzenkandidat is what happens when you get something stuck in your throat . 
   arguably the mainstream view within the uk as a whole not really . 
  yougov 's polling has shown that [ ` leave eu ' has n't been in the lead since february ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sixdlxs.png ) . 
  the uk 's information commissioner has also ordered the home office to release the report , as a result of a freedom of information request i made earlier this year .

   why do you thing more equality is better ? 
  more equal societies have less crime and better health ( both physical and mental ) , for a start - and not just for those on the lower end of the income spectrum . 
  benefits are felt for those at the top as well ( although the effect is smaller in magnitude ) . 
  analysis shows that this correlation applies not just between countries , but within countries as well . 
  moreover , it does n't matter whether equality is achieved through redistribution or as a result of more equal income * before * government intervention . 
  the more extreme one ( which was implemented at the uk 's behest , it should be noted ) was ruled illegal by the ecj . 
  yes . 
  it has been referred by the irish high court to the european court of justice as a result of [ europe v facebook 's judicial review of the irish data protection commissioner 's action in their case ] ( http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ie/cases/iehc/2014/h310.html ) . 
  this is the reference :  whether in the course of determining a complaint which has been made to an independent office holder who has been vested by statute with the functions of administering and enforcing data protection legislation that personal data is being transferred to another third country ( in this case , the united states of america ) the laws and practices of which , it is claimed , do not contain adequate protections for the data subject , that office holder is absolutely bound by the community finding to the contrary contained in commission decision of 26 july 2000 ( 2000/520/ec ) having regard to article 7 and article 8 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union ( 2000/c 364/01 ) , the provisions of article 25 ( 6 ) of directive 95/46/ec notwithstanding ? 
  or , alternatively , may the office holder conduct his or her own investigation of the matter in the light of factual developments in the meantime since that commission decision was first published ? 
  if the cjeu rules that the commissioner is not bound by the decision ( i.e. 
  safe habour ) then that opens up the possibility of individual data protection authorities ruling that safe harbour is inadequate , by itself , in protecting europeans ' rights . 
  the problem is that the industry lobby * does * have privileged access to information , including negotiating positions . 
  it 's civil society that is completely locked out . 
   we do n't get taco bell over here actually , we do . 
  it 's not very good , though . 
   yes , but by opposing jean-claude juncker , cameron is specifically asserting his right , as british pm , to reject the spitzenkandidat . 
  thus , it you agree that cameron should oppose juncker , it naturally follows that you believe that the cameron 's authority is greater than that of the spitzenkandidat . 
  this means that you do n't support the spitzenkandidat system . 
  you 're assuming that they even know about the spitzenkandidaten system . 
  if they do n't , then your inference is invalid . 
   ukip campaigned specifically on a brexit ticket . 
  anyone who wants a brexit automatically does n't want a spitzenkandidat to have power over the british people . 
  ukip do n't want * anybody * to have power . 
  that does not necessarily mean that they disagree with the process specifically , they just do n't want the uk to take part in * any * process involving europe . 
   the conservatives campaigned specifically on a renegotiation , a repatriation of powers and a referendum . 
  it would be astonishing if anyone who voted for the conservatives , and therefore supports a repatriation of powers , supports the spitzenkandidat system . 
  again , supposition . 
   labour opposed schulz prior to the election and then juncker after the election . 
  the rest of the s&d grouping did the exact opposite of this , and are voting for juncker in the parliamentary vote , primarily on the basis that he heads the grouping with the largest number of seats . 
  labour , by not following this are showing that they are totally out of step with the rest of the s&d grouping in relation to the spitzenkandidat system . 
  so they do n't like schulz or junker . 
  that does not mean they do n't support the * process * , just the people chosen this time around . 
  in fact , read [ this blog post ] ( http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/juncker-europe/ ) by a labour mep and try and tell me that 's not supporting , even tacitly , the spitzenkandidaten process . 
  well some have actually used words to that effect . 
  i recall a newsnight interview with a tory mp before the budget saying something like that . 
  there 's also [ this 2005 interview with david cameron ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/18/conservatives.interviews ) , done just after he won the leadership contest :  what about the minimum wage ? 
  his old boss , michael howard , once predicted that would deprive millions of people of their jobs . 
   cameron responds : ' i think the minimum wage has been a success , yes . ', 
   his party 's predictions about it were utterly wrong ? 
   ` it turned out much better than many people expected , including the cbi . ', 
  which is about as close as you can get !, 
   i do n't think the solution is to push forward anyway and claim democratic mandates that do n't exist .
