   i think it could have been severely improved . 
  there i have no disagreement , but it was the first time the process was used . 
  if the same process is used in 2019 i 'm sure it will be better in many ways as everybody will be on the same page as to exactly what it means . 
   it seems to be democratic in theory , if you assume that the european parliament is treated in the same way in the minds of the public as national parliaments are . 
  unfortunately for federalists , it is largely seen as a throwaway vote where people decide to stick two fingers ( or on the continent , one finger ) to their government . 
  while it 's true that the elections tend to favour opposition parties more than those in government , the european parliament is trusted * much * more than national parliaments across the eu . 
  there are only 4 ( iirc ) countries where the national parliament is trusted more than the european parliament . 
  ( source : eurobarometer )  i do n't believe that the people who voted for epp parties had juncker in mind . 
  they might have had the leader of their national epp-member party in mind , but a minority had juncker in mind . 
  probably disproportionately many people had their spitzenkandidat in mind on this board , but i 'm also not convinced this board is representative of every european voter . 
  probably true . 
  however , the political parties did try and broadcast the spitzenkandidaten process . 
  junker and schulz toured the union , and several debates were held and broadcast across the union . 
  the two main english-language ones were broadcast on euronews and on ebu member stations , including the bbc here in the uk . 
   the personal mandate of the prime minister is derived from the popular vote , it 's just a technicality - the system works best this way in practice - that it 's really the support of mps that they need . 
  the system could n't work any other way , without a separate presidential/prime ministerial election . 
  in the uk the pm does n't even have to have a confidence vote , it 's implicit . 
  in 2010 , the queen invited cameron to form a government even * before * the coalition agreement was agreed and signed so it was n't even a sure thing that he had the support of mps . 
   i do n't believe that juncker has that mandate , so i think it 's wrong for him to be the president based on his supposed one . 
  an elected president would be a good thing in principle just ... not like this . 
  i , obviously , disagree , 
   we need more democratization of the eu unfortunately , some member states ( e.g. 
  the uk ) are pushing against this . 
  see , for instance , the move against the spitzenkandidaten system . 
   the one where we got a president forced through for the first time without unanimity in the council because of a false mandate ? 
  a false mandate ? 
  junker is the epp 's spitzenkandidat . 
  the epp won the most seats in the european parliament . 
  it 's only right that , in a parliamentary democracy , that he gets the first chance at being elected ( and he has n't been elected yet ) by parliament . 
  as an aside , that vote happened in the european council , not the council of the european union . 
  ( europe does seem to have too many bodies with the word ` council ' in their name , to be fair ... ), 
   we have a relationship with europe such that we are bound by their laws but do n't get to influence them erm , you do remember the election we just had , right ? 
  the one where we elect representatives to the european parliament where they get to , as you put it , influence laws . 
  in fact we have the 3rd largest number of meps in parliament . 
  not to mention that eu law must * also * pass through the council of the european union where our government has a vote . 
   higher minimum wage = more unemployment , higher prices . 
  there should n't be no minimum wage of any sort . 
  that 's what the conservatives said in the uk when the national minimum wage was introduced . 
  these days , they 're fully in support of it as they have been proven wrong . 
  305 use proxy, 
  or you could use a preferential system , akin to av . 
  rank the options in the order of preference , the least popular gets eliminated and the votes transferred to the next preference . 
   yes but the parliament strong armed them against the spirit of the treaty . 
  what the parliament decided - in advance of the elections , and with the implicit support of the vast majority of political parties and governments - is * well * within the spirit of the treaty . 
  in fact , it 's pretty much what that article in the treaty was designed to do . 
   an arch-federalist i love that through this whole process junker 's description has been upgraded from just a `` federalist '' to an `` arch-federalist '' . 
  needs more councils . 
  it 's a bit early for panto season :p, 
   er , all international negotiations are conducted ` in secret ' , so to speak , so i do n't see this as suspect . 
  it 's a necessity to prevent vested interests from putting their foot down on issues and making agreement impossible . 
  er , wto , wipo and who allow public access to negotiating texts ...  as to the isds , some form of isds is part of pretty much every fta and investment treaty , so i do n't see why this one is so bad . 
  to quote from that document :  for example , they can include direct expropriation ( e.g. 
  seizure of assets ) by the host country by force and without proper compensation , discrimination , lack of due process in the domestic court system , or restrictions to international transfers of capital . 
  are the eu and us really in danger of that ? 
  come on ... 
    i 'm all for joining the euro - otherwise we will be left behind  - nik , uk , 1999  source with tons of other comments like it : http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/477403.stm  i 'm enjoying the scaremongering headlines that echo 1999 as to whether we 'd join the euro or not . 
   we now all know how fucked our economy would be were we reliant on the european bank and not able to react quickly to the financial crisis via altering interest rates and quantitive easing via the bank of england - our economy being the only one in the last year to show any sign of decent growth whilst france stagnates and southern europe is in poverty . 
  how do you know that the position we are in now is n't behind compared to where we would have been if we were in the eurozone ? 
  what would the ecb/eurozone structure/reaction have looked like if the uk was a member ? 
  the truth is nobody knows . 
   the parliament 's triumph will damage the commission 's authority by making it more subservient to the eu legislature . 
  it will politicise a body supposed to consist of commissioners who , working with their non-partisan civil service , represent the general eu interest rather than their home nations . 
  the commission has been politicised for quite a while now . 
  it has n't been left-right politically balanced for at least 3 or 4 commissions . 
  let 's not forget that borosso is an epp man himself . 
   the parliament 's power grab should not surprise eu governments , least of all london . 
  under the banner of democracy , elected assemblies have done this for the past 400 years of european history , nowhere more famously than in 17th-century england . 
  national political parties and governments have managed to believe their own propaganda that the european parliament does n't matter when it came to elections . 
  they 've all used the ep elections to bash incumbent parties or governments-in-waiting rather than campaign on the issues . 
  of course , this head-in-sand action has helped the eurosceptic parties , who - at least in the uk and from what i 've seen on reddit and a few other english-language news sources - like to campaign against the eu as it was 5/10/15 years ago , ignoring the powers that the directly elected parliament has so they can over-state the level of democratic deficit in the union ( even though it has n't yet been eliminated ) . 
  well , the flag of europe is mentioned , along with other items , as a symbol of the european union by 16 of the 28 members in [ a declaration ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_protocols,_annexes_and_declarations_attached_to_the_treaties_of_the_european_union/declarations#52._declaration_by_the_kingdom_of_belgium.2c_the_republic_of_bulgaria.2c_the_federal_republic_of_germany.2c_the_hellenic_republic.2c_the_kingdom_of_spain.2c_the_italian_republic.2c_the_republic_of_cyprus.2c_the_republic_of_lithuania.2c_the_grand-duchy_of_luxembourg.2c_the_republic_of_hungary.2c_the_republic_of_malta.2c_the_republic_of_austria.2c_the_portuguese_republic.2c_romania.2c_the_republic_of_slovenia_and_the_slovak_republic_on_the_symbols_of_the_european_union ) attached to the treaties :  belgium , bulgaria , germany , greece , spain , italy , cyprus , lithuania , luxemburg , hungary , malta , austria , portugal , romania , slovenia and the slovak republic ** declare that the flag with a circle of twelve golden stars on a blue background ** , the anthem based on the `` ode to joy '' from the ninth symphony by ludwig van beethoven , the motto `` united in diversity '' , the euro as the currency of the european union and europe day on 9 may ** will for them continue as symbols to express the sense of community of the people in the european union and their allegiance to it ** . 
  ( emphasis mine ) this was a carry-over from the treaty establishing a constitution for europe that did n't manage to get unanimous support from member states . 
  ironically , france is not a signatory to the declaration . 
  the flag of europe ( it 's not * just * the eu flag ) is flown * in addition to * national flags , not instead of . 
   they just rolled in after the fact with promises of wealth and power . 
  and that has had a pacifying effect on europe . 
   they did n't really do much in kosovo either true , it has n't ended war in the * entire * continent , but there is a lot less of it . 
  none of what you have said invalidates the fact that the continent is the most peaceful that it has ever been , though . 
  you 're assuming that there are always entrenched positions and strict voting . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  the various member states negotiate and try to convince each other on the issues , to try and achieve a consensus . 
  and in the european parliament it comes down not to nationality , but to issues . 
  the political groups in the parliament vote increasingly less along national lines and coalitions are built issue-by-issue on policy . 
  it 's not like we 're being out-voted because we lack influence - we 're the 3rd largest member by number of meps so we * do * influence policy . 
  people keep going on about our ties with the commonwealth , they 're really not as strong as they 're made out to be . 
  the uk can barely influence its way out of a paper bag within the majority of the commonwealth . 
   what peace ? 
  how can you seriously ask that question ? 
  for pretty much all of history various european populations have been at war with one another . 
  since wwii the continent has been immensely peaceful , and with the expansion eastwards of the eu and nato , progressively so . 
   this ever closer union has come to pass without vote without a single , pan-european vote perhaps . 
  but not without vote at all . 
  we 've had various national referendums and a * lot * of changes of government and not a single member state has withdrawn from the union . 
   and has allowed some really racist parties to ( like in france and in greece ) come to be because racist parties do n't exist in countries that are n't in the eu ? 
   were it not for the eu , i am sure there would be more peace in europe ( certainly more prosperity ) . 
  i 'm not sure how you could claim this , at all . 
  there 's no way to know what would have happened in this counterfactual scenario . 
  i do n't think anybody has said that nato was n't an important factor . 
  but just as it would be silly to say that nato is n't one of the reasons , it would be silly to say that the eu was n't an important factor either . 
  the flag is n't * just * the flag of the eu - it 's the flag of europe , for all peoples of europe .
