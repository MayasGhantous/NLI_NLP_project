  yes , because laying the groundwork for stopping acta , preventing three-strikes legislation , strengthening the data protection regulation , working for the right of the blind and visually impaired to have more access to literature , exposing ttip , getting strong net neutrality passed and performing outreach for the parliament is strong evidence of being useless ... 
  germany may well end up electing more pirate meps than sweden , though . 
  the last poll i saw had them winning 2 seats which would be awesome . 
  christian engstrom and amelia andersdotter have done great work in the parliament the last 5 and 2 1/2 years , respectively . 
  it will be a shame to see europe lose out on amelia 's talents . 
  so , pretty much [ eurostat ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home ) ? 
   eu spends less than a billion on esa . 
  esa is n't an eu institution ( yet ) , so that 's not surprising . 
  he still sounds as bored and disinterested as when he was speaking english . 
  this is not the first time that [ migrationwatch 's xenophobic prejudice is causing it to twist the truth ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/16/immigration-uk-jobs-andrew-green ) . 
  the ons figures prove that farage & co. were scaremongering about the restrictions being lifted . 
  no surprises there . 
  no , not really . 
  why would it ? 
  the best part about the uk 's constitution is that it 's so flexible . 
  the worst part about the uk 's constitution is that it 's so flexible . 
  nope . 
  until 1999 they used to be fptp !, 
  northern ireland does use stv , though . 
  also the parties that get more than 2.5 % get their # 5,000 deposit back . 
   it even says in their manifestos and adverts that they 're `` at the top of the paper '' . 
  amusingly , they were n't counting on the 4 freedoms party , which is top of the list in at least one region . 
  or that you 're biased towards the left on some issues and biased towards the right on others , which does n't necessarily mean that you 're doing it right . 
  ( although i 'm , in general , a fan of the bbc ), 
  they 're standard [ iso 3166-1 alpha-2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-1_alpha-2 ) country codes . 
  `` non-tariff barriers '' is the phrase to look out for in ftas . 
  member states * have * to use some sort of proportional system for european parliament elections , thankfully . 
  in great britain this is party-list proportional ( d'hondt method ) and in northern ireland it 's stv . 
  for me , i 'm british first , european second and if pressed for a third identity i 'd probably split it between my home town/county ( reading/berkshire ) and my chosen home ( manchester ) . 
  i have almost no affinity with england at all , despite living my entire life in the country , and just as you feel like british is a bit irrelevant i think the english identity is a bit irrelevant , for me at least . 
  identity is a deeply personal thing , though , so while englishness ( for lack of a better word ) means nothing to me , i can completely understand and empathise with the fact that you identify as english rather than british . 
  the real answer is that it 's not just one thing . 
  it 's the eu . 
  it 's nato . 
  it 's the cold war . 
  its the loss of colonial empires . 
  it 's the relative ability to travel and communicate freely . 
  it 's globalised trade . 
  * all * of these things have made war in europe , and to a lesser extent elsewhere , less desirable and less feasible . 
  all of these things have co-evolved together . 
  the uk is one such country, 
   our highly educated work force and the unique combination of the english language and the euro being used in ireland all help to attract icts . 
  and favourable ( to the companies ) data protection law and a [ severely under-resourced ] ( http://gutjahr.biz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/data-protection-commission1.jpg ) commission to keep them in check . 
   is information information if it 's not being communicated ? 
  sure . 
  by way of an analogy , do books contain information even when they 're not being read ? 
  i 'm sure it ca n't be 2/3 of * all * students and that there are other courses where the gender mix is the other way around . 
  the intelligence community actually has a term for this - [ loveint ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loveint ) . 
  awesome news , ~ ~ but it 's a bit unfortunate that the court did n't immediately apply the effects of the directive 's invalidity . ~ ~ * edit : apparently this was from the advocate general 's opinion and the final judgment did n't impose this restriction , the directive is completely invalid . 
  * also , i ca n't wait to see the ukip spin on this one . 
  something something unelected judges , something something dark side . 
  indeed , policing by consent seems to work pretty well here . 
  except for the met ... the met needs to be taken round the back of the proverbial sheds and shot . 
  reminds me of [ this news story ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7899171.stm ) :  details of how police in the irish republic finally caught up with the country 's most reckless driver have emerged , the irish times reports . 
   he had been wanted from counties cork to cavan after racking up scores of speeding tickets and parking fines . 
   however , each time the serial offender was stopped he managed to evade justice by giving a different address . 
   but then his cover was blown . 
   it was discovered that the man every member of the irish police 's rank and file had been looking for - a mr prawo jazdy - was n't exactly the sort of prized villain whose apprehension leads to an officer winning an award . 
   in fact he was n't even human . 
   `` prawo jazdy is actually the polish for driving licence and not the first and surname on the licence , '' read a letter from june 2007 from an officer working within the garda 's traffic division . 
  when this law comes in to effect , yes . 
  kroes ' version had a loophole large enough to drive a tank through it , and she knew it . 
  it was thanks to meps like amelia andersdotter , catherine trautmann , cornelia ernst and rina ronja kari ( the meps who put forward the strong nn amendments ) that we have the result we have now . 
  a lot ( if not all ) of this is down to previous regulation by the european union . 
  this new legislation is just finishing the job . 
  it should appear on [ votewatch.eu ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/european-parliament-latest-votes.html ) some time soon . 
  there is also [ wepromise.eu ] ( https://www.wepromise.eu ) where you can see which candidates have signed up to the charter to protect digital rights . 
   as long as your friends have it and there 's the problem . 
  not everybody wants to hand over their contact list to facebook . 
  where does the capital come from for these startups ? 
   i 'd wager the eu will be quicker to grant ukraine into the eu than a potentially independent scotland i would n't . 
  ukraine is a long way from eu membership and scotland already implements all of the acquis as it 's already in the union . 
   another unsurprising result is that the two most supported parties are the most pro-european ones ( given that in most countries right-wingers are clearly pandering to eurosceptics ) . 
  this could be because the eurosceptics refuse to organise as europarties , and therefore are n't included on lists of europarties . 
  the average for ` have you heard of the european parliament ' is only 89 % for the eu28 . 
  it 's as low as 77 % in the uk ( surprise !, 
  ) , 86 % in poland and 81 % in italy . 
  as for whether the ep is directly elected , the question `` please tell me whether you think the following is true or false : the members of the european parliament are directly elected by the citizens of each member state '' the eu28 average is *** 54 % *** , down to as low as 51 % in the uk . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb80/eb80_anx_en.pdf - page 59 for the directly elected question , page 52 for the heard of question . 
   i 'm pretty sure almost everyone knows about european elections . 
  they may not know who they are voting for , or who the commission candidate is . 
  i suggest you do n't look at the eurobarometer polls then . 
  there 's a shockingly high percentage of the population that has n't heard of the european parliament and/or that the ep is directly elected . 
  jesus , is that a legitimate alde video ? 
  this is a move to consolidate the earlier work done by the eu pressuring vendors to use a standardised charger . 
  they 're not so much `` late to the game '' as `` rounding up the stragglers '' . 
  are you serious ? 
  do you think that , for example , unqualified doctors should be able to perform surgery ? 
  after all , if the state imposes the requirement that medical practitioners have adequate training and qualifications it is interfering in the market . 
   another pro-consumer , anti-waste law . 
  ftfy . 
  auntie has been reporting live from the courtroom , which i find even more ridiculous . 
  ` crap ' and ` good ' are fairly subjective , though , so i would n't hold out hope . 
  more than that , groups are expressly forbidden from campaigning in elections , that 's the exclusive competence of the europarties . 
   it 's easier and you wo n't feel bad when you learn that they do n't do their work , they just want the free money . 
  not all meps do that , many turn up and do their work and do it well . 
   all the health & safety rules that get slated i think that the main reason h&s rules get slated is that people use them as an excuse to do ( or not to do ) something that h&s legislation does n't actually apply to . 
   i think what the eu parliament has to accomplish will turn all those eurosceptics into pragmatic representatives . 
  i do n't see anyone being stupid enough to follow the `` contemporary us republican '' way of doing legislature . 
  have you seen how the likes of ukip behave ?
