  the eu is far from perfect but we are definitely better in it . 
  whether you are an internationalist or a nationalist britain benefits from being in the eu far more than being on it 's own . 
  yeah if the queen even looks like she is trying to influence govenment much it could cause a constitutional crisis . 
  yet alone forming/dissolving governments in a non-ceremonial way . 
  because sex sells and rihanna is n't very talented . 
  what do you want her to do ? 
  produce original art ? 
  in the british school system . 
  i 'm still trying to overcome that handicap . 
   nationalism is a projection of belonging and having a purpose in society that is arguably the basis for most nationalism and patriotism . 
  not just when exhibited by a minority in a foriegn country . 
  yeah i guess but really it only proves my point . 
  a lot of people are voting based on bias rather than having weighed up all sides of the issue . 
  here 's some more stuff that loosely fits ` reconquista patrols ' or christian terroism and other religously motivated crimes - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_marwa_el-sherbini https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabra_and_shatila_massacre https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tel_al-zaatar_massacre https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karantina_massacre https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/army_of_god_%28united_states%29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concerned_christians https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phineas_priesthood https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centennial_olympic_park_bombing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_african_republic_conflict_under_the_djotodia_administration https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_liberation_front_of_tripura https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_council_of_nagaland https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_genocide https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_in_the_bosnian_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre there has also been reprisals against muslims , normally just the local mosque not actual dangerous groups , after terroist attacks like paris or 9/11 . 
  there are too many of them to list ranging from vandalism to murder . 
  this one is n't religiously motivated but was politically motivated murders of mainly turkish people living in germany so pretty revlevant - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nsu_murders of course when christians do it they are political fringe groups and lone nutters . 
  when muslims do it it 's because all muslims are bad . 
  `` christians are good guys if we ignore all the examples when they are not '' . 
  i 'm not saying this is n't an issue but could anyone provide a source from a less partisan charity . 
  open doors is specifically a charity for protecting christians from persecution . 
  it seems independent government or charities like amnesty international would give us a better complete picture of exactly who much of an issue this is for christians and how this kind of abuse stacks up against other abuse from migrants , and abuse from german people themselves . 
  as i said i 'm not saying i find this hard to believe . 
  just that the experience of one man and the report of one charity only intersted in christians seems like a flimsy case . 
  also it would be interesting to know why the researchs for open doors are so sure they can extrapolate the 200 cases they looked into , to estimating up to 40,000 christian refugees could be victims of abuse or violence . 
  the only reason this thread is being upvoted so much is because it is telling people what they expect to hear . 
  if the claim was about something else with equally weak evidence i think people would be questioning it more instead of automatically accepting it as solid proof . 
  i of course agree that when this does happen , which it clearly has at least 200 times , it should be dealt with by the laws of the land as they would apply to any other person regardless of race , religion or political status . 
  the downvotes you got for pointing out that not all muslims are fundamentalist believers in their religion has annoyed me so i 'll make the effort for you -  `` when the son of man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , he will sit on his glorious throne . 
  32 all the nations will be gathered before him , and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats . 
  33 he will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left . 
   `` then the king will say to those on his right , ` come , you who are blessed by my father ; take your inheritance , the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world . 
  35 for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat , i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , i was a stranger and you invited me in , 36 i needed clothes and you clothed me , i was sick and you looked after me , i was in prison and you came to visit me . '  `` then the righteous will answer him , ` lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you something to drink ? 
  38 when did we see you a stranger and invite you in , or needing clothes and clothe you ? 
  39 when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you ? '  `` the king will reply , ` truly i tell you , whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine , you did for me . '  `` then he will say to those on his left , ` depart from me , you who are cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels . 
  42 for i was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat , i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink , 43 i was a stranger and you did not invite me in , i needed clothes and you did not clothe me , i was sick and in prison and you did not look after me . '  `` they also will answer , ` lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison , and did not help you ? '  `` he will reply , ` truly i tell you , whatever you did not do for one of the least of these , you did not do for me . '  `` then they will go away to eternal punishment , but the righteous to eternal life . '' and  come now , you rich , weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you . 
  your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten . 
  your gold and silver have rusted , and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire . 
  you have laid up for treasure for the last days . 
  behold , the wages of the labourers who mowed your fields , which you have kept back by fraud , cry out ; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the lord of hosts . 
  you have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure ; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter and  he who loves gold will not be justified , and he who pursues money will be led astray by it . 
  many have come to ruin because of gold , and their destruction has met them face to face . 
  it is a stumbling block to those who are devoted to it , and every fool will be taken captive by it and  when you reap in your harvest in the field , and have forgotten a sheaf in the field , you shall not go back to get it ... when you beat your olive trees , you shall not go over the boughs again ... when you gather the grapes of your vineyard , you shall not glean it afterward ; it shall be for the sojourner , the fatherless and the widow . 
  you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of egypt ; therefore i command you to do this and  even though you make many prayers , i will not listen ; your hands are full of blood ... cease to do evil , learn to do good ; seek justice , correct oppression ; defend the fatherless , plead for the widow and  you shall not oppress your neighbour ... but you shall love your neighbour as yourself : i am the lord and  again i tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of god and  thus , when you give to the needy , sound no trumpet before you , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may be praised by others . 
  truly , i say to you , they have received their reward . 
  but when you give to the needy , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing , so that your giving may be in secret . 
  and your father who sees in secret will reward you . 
  and  for i do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened , but that as a matter of fairness your abundance at the present time should supply their need , so that their abundance may supply your need , that there may be fairness . 
  as it is written , `` whoever gathered much had nothing left over , and whoever gathered little had no lack . '' and  and all who believed were together and had all things in common . 
  and they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all , as any had need . 
  and  if you go into your neighbor 's vineyard , you may eat your fill of grapes , as many as you wish , but you shall not put any in your bag . 
  if you go into your neighbor 's standing grain , you may pluck the ears with your hand , but you shall not put a sickle to your neighbor 's standing grain . 
  and  again i saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , nor bread to the wise , nor riches to the intelligent , nor favor to those with knowledge , but time and chance happen to them all . 
  and  and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said : `` blessed are you who are poor , for yours is the kingdom of god . 
  `` blessed are you who are hungry now , for you shall be satisfied . 
  `` blessed are you who weep now , for you shall laugh . 
  `` blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil , on account of the son of man !, 
  rejoice in that day , and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven ; for so their fathers did to the prophets . 
  `` but woe to you who are rich , for you have received your consolation . 
  and  it is god 's gift to humankind that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all their toil and this one is n't part of the bible but was written by basil of caesarea who was very important in early christianity said  who is the covetous man ? 
  one for whom plenty is not enough . 
  who is the defrauder ? 
  one who takes away what belongs to everyone . 
  and are not you covetous , are you not a defrauder , when you keep for private use what you were given for distribution ? 
  when some one strips a man of his clothes we call him a thief . 
  and one who might clothe the naked and does not -- should not he be given the same name ? 
  the bread in your hoard belongs to the hungry ; the cloak in your wardrobe belongs to the naked ; the shoes you let rot belong to the barefoot ; the money in your vaults belongs to the destitute . 
  all you might help and do not -- to all these you are doing wrong i could go on but i think that is plenty ... lol you can argue over whether islam is inherently more or less violent than christianity , the nature of personal belief and all that stuff but anyone who ca n't admit that christianity is also very hypocritical and factional is simply ignoring the facts . 
  if most christians lived by the bible they would be dedicated socialists of some sort who hold all property in common and who spent their whole lives working towards helping others and just covering the basic needs of themselves . 
  and we all know how true that is , the majority of christians are either pretty ` normal ' people or are actually more intolerant than average . 
  and the catholic church just beggar 's belief with ignoring all this stuff . 
  well yeah it 's not aleppo but it is one of the worst off out of the big cities of the uk . 
  it is easier to romanticise poverty half a world away . 
  the attitude towards native americans by many in the us reminds me a bit of scrooge in a christmas carol . 
   `` are there no ~ ~ prisons ~ ~ reservations ? '', 
   `` plenty of reservations ... ''  `` and the ~ ~ workhouses ~ ~ food kitchens . '', 
  `` are they still in operation ? '', 
   `` both very busy , sir ... ''  `` those who are badly off must go there . '', 
   `` many ca n't go there ; and many would rather die . '', 
   `` if they would rather die , '' said scrooge , `` they had better do it , and decrease the surplus population . '', 
  yeah and i agree but syria is the worst place for us and uk aid workers to go right now . 
  the increased risk of them being targetted means they normally advise people from the uk or us who want to help out to go somewhere like turkey and help with refugees who have already left syria . 
  you 're french , should n't you be busy laughing at how you gain more from the eu than the british but only enforce any of the regulations when they suit you ? 
  the eu is great in principle but the way it 's being operated at the moment is awful . 
  i 'm so glad we are part of a democratic organisation like the eu ... 
  the eu is in a horrible state as it is , it 's only hope is to drop countries , adding news one would just seal it 's fate . 
  they should get rid of greece , cyprus , spain , portugal and ireland . 
  that is if you are looking at it in a machiavellian , selfish manner from the point of view of countries like france , germany , britain and the low countries . 
  edit : prove me wrong . 
  i 'm not saying it is a nice thing or kind thing or even what i 'd do myself if i had the power , just that it is would work as a utilitarian approach for the remaining countrys . 
  i read about that too but i asked two swiss people about it who i met in my travels and neither had any idea what i was on about . 
  this map is crap , not only does the . gif move to quick but there are lots of inaccuracies . 
  `` starving people would vote for the one that is feeding them . '', 
  yeah bread and circuses politics are * such * a good way of doing things . 
  people thought the same about the national socialist german workers ' party . 
  all the people who get butthurt over race stuff are the ones who perpetuate it being an issue . 
  ignore it , realise all media is bias , form your own opinions and try to encourage others to do the same . 
  warped is n't the right word to use , we actually have islamic people to thank for a lot of the culture that western society maintained from greek and roman times . 
  islam has been around for a long time . 
  the problem is n't that it 's warping universal values , it 's just failed to keep up with the times . 
  i might be being slightly pedantic but i think it 's an important difference .
