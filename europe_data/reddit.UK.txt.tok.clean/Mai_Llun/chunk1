please liberate us from our own stupidity . 
  [ well we are , so go fuck yourself ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/international-body-grants-wales-country-1813629.amp?client=ms-android-samsung ) . 
  ;-) * edit : in case you missed the smiley , i was only joking about the ` go fuck yourself ' part . 
  i feel that everyone * should be given a second chance . 
  i feel that , those who have fallen on hard times and have made a mistake , should be given the opportunity and resources to turn their lives around . 
  * however , there are some crimes that are unforgivable . 
  this news report is one example . 
  for these people should be punished justly and removed from society . 
  ~ ~ iirc , ( i 'm pro-eu before someone says different ) i think the echr ruled against literal life sentences as the perpetrator ( s ) must have some chance of release ; otherwise it 's deemed as inhumane . 
  it 's one of the very few judgments i disagree with from the echr . ~ ~ ~ ~ could 've got that horrifically wrong , so please someone correct me if i have . ~ ~ edit : okay , i 've quickly re-familarised myself with the law , and it appears a bit different to what i remember . 
  [ here 's the actual law ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/european-court-of-human-rights-upholds-whole-life-prison-sentence-for-mass-murderer-10020323.html%3famp?client=ms-android-samsung )  the strasbourg-based judges ruled that whole-life sentences were only incompatible with the convention if there was no possibility of a review so basically , life sentences are allowed , so long as there 's a chance of appeal and a case review . 
   perhaps the next step should be debunking myths on brexit . 
  we tried that , but we just got called `` remoaners '' and `` fear-mongers '' . 
  upvoted , good point . 
  i do agree , even when writing it , i felt milliband probably was n't the greatest example . 
  thank you . 
   career politicians god i hate that phrase ; it simplifies what is effectively a complex and multifaceted issue . 
  bare this in mind , you 've got to look at this objectively ; you may not agree with their politics , but it 's how they conduct themselves is the real issue here . 
  yes , there are some shitty politicians who just chase the money , but i bet the majority are actually in politics to try and do ( what they perceive to be ) right by their country ; by enacting their beliefs . 
  working career to serve the people you set out to represent is n't a bad thing . 
  having someone who feels passionately about an ideology/belief , who has studied politics/law/economics from school to postgraduate , who 's gained the experienced through their political career and understands how politics works , who 's done all the grassroots work and just wants to make their country a better place ( by their ideology ) , is n't a bad thing . 
  despite your prejudices , there 's much more intricacies and knowledge involved in political discourse than what you see in the media . 
  your gripe is n't with `` career politicians '' it 's with shitty politicians who conflict your ideologies and beliefs . 
  case in point ( again , bare in mind objectivity - i do n't politically identify with either of these examples ) : - farage , born in an upper class family , privately educated and worked in the banking sector before becoming a politician , who played the media , did n't turn up to actual debates and chased the money . 
  - ed miliband , immigrant family ~ ~ ( so probably low-middle class ) ~ ~ , state school , ppe at oxford , became a labour party special adviser and economics teacher at harvard , politician . 
  which one is egregious and which one is respectable ? 
  they 've both worked hard , undoubtedly ( it 's not easy to become a high profile member of society ) , both are `` career politicians '' , but it 's what they 've done with their time as a politician that counts , and their goals . 
  edit : probably not the best examples , but the point still stands . 
  i just do n't see the point knocking people who legitimately have dedicated their lives to politics for the good of the country . 
  i think it really depends if they 're a shitty politician or a real representative of the people . 
  thankfully i 'm half scot ( my mam is scottish ) , so if the independence referendum is a yes , i 'm definitely getting duel nationality !, 
   leaving the eu * sobs uncontrollably * i do n't know , i just do n't know anymore ... 
  unfortunately , due to the pr machine surrounding the monarchy and the [ laws that restrict reporting on royals ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-royal-family-are-exempt-from-freedom-of-information-requests-and-can-veto-bbc-programmes-why-do-9956702.html ) , i 'll use impartial and even their own sources to try and show how false the figures are and why we should do without them . 
  [ the crown estates belongs to westminster ] ( https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/media/198564/tce-overview-pink.png?anchor=middlecenter&amp;mode=crop&amp;quality=80&amp;format=png&amp;scale=both&amp;width=796&amp;height=436 ) , the reigning monarch is esentially a [ sole corporation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporation_sole#the_crown ) meaning that they are only * `` a legal entity consisting of a single ( `` sole '' ) incorporated office , occupied by a single natural person '' * ; in my cynical opinion , the reason why the monarch holds this position is to appear like they own the lands ; whoever 's the monarch is the neutral holder of the crown estate , not the actual owner . 
  essentially , the royal family siphon off some of the profits from lands that they do not own ; [ 15 % is their current cut under the sovereign grant ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36643314 ) . 
  as you can see from the sources , the grant given to the royals does not include security ; though granted any figure or position that would replace the monarchy would require protection , the individual would n't have their whole extended family under extended state protection , therefore would likely cost less . 
  this means that the queen will receive # 42.8 m this year , for purely being born into wealth and privilege ; [ meanwhile more people than ever are using food-banks in the uk ] ( https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/ ) . 
  the tourism argument is also thrown around , but as / u/countofzala pointed out , you can not attribute uk tourism to the royals . 
  you ca n't even go into the majority ` their ' palaces ; and buckingham palace is only open periodically . 
  there are far bigger and actual tourist attractions in the uk ; in fact none of the royal family attractions actually make [ the top 50 list of tourist attractions ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uks-top-50-visitor-attractions-7509660 ) . 
  now you 're probably going to cite the cultural aspects of tourism , but unfortunately that does n't really hold up . 
  culture is subjective and without trying to get into the systematics of ` british identity ' , i 'm going to argue this from a home nations point of view ; i 'm of the opinion that ` british ' is just an extension of ` english ' . 
  so , i can see why someone could argue that the queen represents english culture , but as for welsh and scottish culture i 'm not too sure . 
  anecdotal but , i 've never met anyone in wales who openly supports the royal family . 
  [ polling by the bbc ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8124065.stm ) done in 2009 shows support for the monarchy lower than the national average and that the figures are inflated by elderly support . 
  the last `` true '' ( whatever that means ) monarch of wales died in 1415 ; she rarely visits wales or gives us any of these apparent `` tourist benefits '' . 
  the same can be said for scotland . 
  yes , they unified the monarchs and the official position of the snp is to retain the monarchy under independence ( on the basis of a referendum ) , however [ polling suggests that the official policy of the snp is out of touch with what their supporters want ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/humza-yousaf-most-people-in-snp-want-to-get-rid-of-monarchy-1-4127741 ) . 
  also , [ can anyone really argue scotland would keep the monarchy under independence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfu8rojutmo ) ? 
  i 've already spent to long on this , so i 'm just going to briefly sum up the rest of the points . 
  it 's not right someone should be born into state funded wealth and authority ( yes they never exercise their powers , but can anyone really argue that the position does n't give an aura of authority - would you bow or know to any other aristocrats if they were n't connected to the royals ? ) . 
  we should be a democratic and meritocratic society ; the monarchy perpetuates the class system and is deeply socially unjust . 
  no man or woman should have to kneel for anyone ; we are all equals . 
  it 's also really sycophantic and weird ; it 's like a personality cult or a human zoo . 
  now you may argue that a president would be worse ( that old cliche of `` more politicians '' ) , but so long as the position is a-political , transparent , electorally fair and democratic , i see no problem ; see president of [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_germany ) for details . 
  * sigh * this is always thrown around when the royal family come up . 
  it 's a myth debunked many times before . 
  forgive my ignorance here , why would they have diplomatic immunity ? 
  unless they are part of a sa envoy/diplomatic service , they 're just regular tourist and should be subject to the same laws . 
  well , that 's the way it should be in my opinion anyway . 
  diplomatic immunity serves a very important propose mind . 
  it 's a very hard line , but i think it should only be reserved for the vital members of an embassy . 
   but the leftists feel noble for taking in these people and will continue to ignore the anger until the mobs come knocking for their scalps . 
  you 're conflating issues here . 
  i 'm leftwing , but i 'm not in favour of open borders . 
  i believe in helping refugees though , but i feel like simply re-settling refugees is like putting a plaster on a stab wound . 
  the problem needs to be sorted at source . 
  was that real ? 
  it looks like a parody . 
  this is bullshit hyperbole . 
  you ca n't be a member of an organisation that identifies itself as racist ; combat18 , the bnp , britian first , edl etc. 
  are excluded . 
  rightwing parties such as the conservatives , ukip , dup & ulster unionist party are permissable . 
  never under estimate mental gymnastics, 
  the guy 's an absolute immature prick on [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/ramsaysky?s=09 ) as well , which makes it worse . 
  hard to believe he 's 40 , let alone a ` journalist ' . 
  he dismisses legitimate criticism of him as ` trolling ' , which is funny , as his gutter ` journalism ' is more akin to trolling . 
  sky news is a national disgrace . 
  murdoc 's media is a disease . 
  in the uk , we have serious problems with radical islamic gangs in prisons . 
  a lot of offenders/potential terrorists are radicalised there . 
  as if facts and studies count for anything . 
  it 's so embarrassing , we must look like spoilt children to the rest of europe . 
  we already had the best deal by far , so many concessions ; not that many who voted leave knew that anyway . 
  i think this will just leave both sides unhappy . 
  honestly , it 's embarrassing . 
  there 's a slight majority ( 52 % ) in my country that 's quite alright making the rest of us look like fools in europe . 
  we already had the best deal out of any member states and now we just come across as a spoilt child . 
  may i suggest contacting the british embsay . 
  here 's their website and contact details : https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-berlin, 
   `` not kidding - if it does n't turn out to be muslims , i 'll personally paypal you $ 500 usd or the equivalent bitcoins whichever you prefer . 
  100 % serious . 
   i 'm an ex muslim and i 'm tired of the regressive left still pretending like they do n't have a problem with this nazi-like ideology called islam . '', 
  we do n't know any hardline facts at this point ; there are only speculative stories , all of which are stating different characteristics about the attacker . 
  man , i am a center-left liberal . 
  i 've never really been fond of the idea of `` multi-culturalism '' . 
  that 's not me being racist . 
  it should n't mater if you 're black , white , east or west asian , so long as you have the desirable skills/qualifications , are willing to integrate , abide , respect and tolerate the democratic laws of our land , you are free to come in . 
  no special treatment for anyone race or religion , society should be secular and equal . 
  to me , `` multi-culturalism '' goes against my idea of a state ; to me , the idea of countries are geographical regions where people 's of one or similar political/social-cultures can come together and govern themselves .
