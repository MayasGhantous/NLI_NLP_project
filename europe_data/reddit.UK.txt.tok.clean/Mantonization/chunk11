  perhaps , but that 's meaningless if it 's a discussion amongst people from europe . 
  using your countries flag is good , because knowing where they 're from means you can easier understand their point of view , since you know what sort of culture they have . 
  having an eu flag negates that entirely . 
   well in usa you can get away with almost everything . 
  you 've proven my point , there . 
  even the us has restrictions on free speech . 
   take the example of banning the nazi , communist symbols . 
  that 's bullshit right here . 
  i know , right ? 
  why wo n't the man let me walk around with a swastika on my shirt !, 
  so lame !, 
  / s where are communist symbols banned ? 
  and by ` communist ' do you actually mean ` soviet union ' ? 
  you have n't addressed my point in the slightest . 
  if that is the case , then no country in the world has free speech . 
  oh piss off . 
  ** every ** country that has free speech has some restriction of one kind or another on it . 
  everything else is just a matter of haggling over price . 
  `` that is a something idea something i something something we something something something words '' ? 
  man , i need more german lessons . 
  well , no , but the ( in this hypothetical ) murder does sort of take precedence in peoples minds , does n't it . 
  `` that guy who does all that charity work '' stops being known as that after he 's found guilty , if that makes sense . 
  they do sort of nullify them . 
  years of charity work does n't really hold much sway after the person flips and commits a triple homicide . 
   `` but the us does good stuff too ! '', 
  you kind of did . 
  doing good does not absolve you of doing bad . 
  it 's not like you can cancel a bad act out with a bunch of good ones . 
   what is power used for if not that off the top of my head , those who are stronger can use that strength to uplift the weaker , rather than stamping on their heads to push themselves higher . 
  i must admit , i 'm a little alarmed this idea did n't occur to you . 
   and can you think of any historical examples counter to that ? 
  the whole idea of ` not fucking people over ' is relatively new history wise , but in american history , the civil war and emancipation comes to mind . 
  or how about the rebuilding of japan following ww2 ? 
  there were ulterior motives to both examples , but they 're still examples of a powerful force using their power for something over than pushing others around . 
  hell , what about foreign aid in general ? 
  especially when it comes to natural disasters , like what happened in japan a year or so ago , or in haiti . 
   it 's a cruel world out there but we ca n't start being indignant when presented with reality . 
  `` it 's a cruel world out there '' stops being a valid excuse when ** we 're the ones making it so ** . 
  being unfair , and then saying ` life is n't fair , deal with it ' is ludicrous . 
   `` what 's the point of being strong if you ca n't use it to push others around ? '', 
  that is what you just said . 
  do you really believe that ? 
  i suppose the problem arises when america uses its power and influence to subvert the will of other states to its needs . 
  example : when it bullied spain into censoring its internet in the name of ` anti-piracy ' . 
  i hope this goes well . 
  we ** really ** need to get off this rock . 
  a lot of people say that space travel or colonisation is pointless , that there are too many problems we have to deal with at home , such as world hunger . 
  those problems exist , sure , but unless we start spreading to other planets all it takes is one cosmological escapade to wipe us out forever . 
  we need a backup . 
  `` freedom has many difficulties , and democracy is not perfect . 
  but we have never had to build a wall to keep our people in . '', 
  and then we can have another [ gin craze ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gin_craze ) !, 
  it will be cheaper than milk once again !, 
  off the top of my head , the magna carta ( while being the precedent for our parliament and a lot of our society in a legal sense ) is mostly about giving power to the lords , so the kind could n't mess around with them or their serfs too much . 
  it would n't stand up today . 
  remember kids !, 
  it 's only a circlejerk if it 's an opinion you do n't agree with !, 
  this is the daily mail . 
  it is a hate filled rag that regular makes stories up ( off the top of my head , one about a murderer who could n't be deported because ` that damn echr !, 
  ' , and a polish dentist who removed all the teeth of her cheating boyfriend ) and is not worth listening it . 
  they literally supported the nazis . 
  i did n't realise that anything other than brown-nosing israel suddenly counted as ` sticking its nose in ' . 
  by ` worrying ' he means they 're worried europe will no longer just accept the idea that israel can be shitty , because its neighbours are even worse ? 
  oh , no , they 're very prompt with that sort of thing . 
  after all , without taxes there would n't be money for sailors or ships , would there . 
  and they do n't pay their taxes , either . 
  it 's a siren , actually . 
  bit of a side note , but is n't that hilarious ? 
  that the symbol of starbucks is a sea monster that lures sailors in with its enchanting song , then eats them once they 've dashed their ships upon the rocks ? 
  the horse is n't just dead . 
  it 's been atomised with the force of the beatings . 
  the last part was n't directed to you , but in general . 
  if human rights stop you doing something to someone , and your first thought is to disregard them , then i would say you 're more concerned in vengeance than justice . 
  aah , so he did n't pay his taxes then ? 
  define ` contributing in a positive way ' . 
  that is incredibly subjective and easily abused by both governments and people . 
  last time i checked , he paid his taxes . 
  hmm , yes . 
  regardless , the reason he was n't deported was because of the fact that we have laws . 
  laws that are only enhanced and improved by the ehcr . 
  if your reaction to that is ` then ignore it !, 
  fuck human rights ! ', 
  then i think you need a long think about your goals here . 
  we got an agreement from jordan that they would n't torture him , i believe . 
  ** edit ** : and while we 're at it , it 's mostly the uk 's own courts that said we could n't deport him . 
  because funnily enough , ` because he 's a twat ' is n't a valid reason for deportation . 
  if he was an actual threat , he could have been arrested and thrown out . 
  but he was n't , so may and her ilk tried to change the laws on it . 
  to which the courts gave a polite but firm ` are you fucking insane ? ', 
  see , this explains everything to me . 
  i was thinking of those straight lines that go down the atlas , and saying to myself ` how can ireland do that , it does n't work that way !, 
  hardly . 
  if anything , the fact that we used to have a huge , ethically dubious empire means we 're more qualified to recognise them than most . 
  are you suggesting that germany has to keep renting military bases to the us , or the us will declare war ? 
  yes , thank you , but that 's not really the thing that worried me . 
  you see , prior to today the only o'reilly i know of is bill o'reilly . 
  so i saw the headline , and thought ` wait , what ? 
  no way ! ' . 
  thankfully , it was n't . 
   my point is that no one will bloody hire them if they cost the employer more than they make for him .
