  simple business principle - you do n't hire people to loose you money . 
  and yet every preceding generation has done so . 
  why , it 's almost like they knew that training up an employee and treating them right will lead to increased loyalty and productivity !, 
  and the stuff on taxes is just bullshit , since most big companies are evading it anyway , and wages have not kept in line with inflation for decades . 
  businesses are richer than ever , so by your logic unemployment should be near non-existent . 
  how do you fucking expect people to get skills or experience if you do n't hire them ? 
  this was n't a problem for previous generations , why is it for ours ? 
  also that ` young people have no work ethic ' line is goddamn bullshit and you know it . 
   lower minimum wage , less regulations on apprenticeships and internships would give young people the chance to get some relevant experience and skills , and help them find a place in the productive workforce . 
  no , what that will do is make it easier for big businesses to fuck young people over . 
  you want young people to get skills and experience , and find their place in the workforce ? 
  ** then bloody hire them ** . 
  do n't make it so they have to work a few years of unpaid internship in shitty conditions , just so they can be considered ( and then rejected because they ` do n't have enough experience ) . 
  speaking as someone who had no idea what a european ombudsman is , that title set alarm bells ringing in my head . 
   you 're not american , therefore you 're fair game and you should just deal with it how about no !, 
  the sheer arrogance of this man !, 
  if he did n't make himself public , he would have just been disappeared . 
  either to gitmo , or to a black site where he 'd be tortured . 
  not only are we one of the biggest beneficiaries of the cap , but more than half of our trade goes to the rest of the eu . 
  not only would we be making it harder to do that if we left , we 'd suddenly be in competition with this economic superpower that 's literally just next door . 
  not smart . 
  make a note , mein freund . 
  italics no longer solely sufficient to convey sarcasm . 
  * governments are supposed to spy on other countries !, 
  why are you so angry about this ? 
  * ** edit ** : in case it 's not obvious , i 'm being sarcastic . 
  and that 's a good mindset to have , but as we see time and again that having industry be unregulated does n't work because ` people are decent , so they 'll act decent ' does n't work . 
  without regulation , businesses act shitty . 
  if they 're not falsely advertising , they 're sticking things into their products that they should n't , and if they 're not doing that they 're polluting the environment . 
  laissez faire does not lead to anything good . 
  do you believe that private businesses should be able to do literally anything they want , with no restrictions or regulations ? 
  if your answer is anything other than ` absolutely ' , then you do want the government to intrude in private business . 
  everything else is a matter of haggling . 
  i take it then , that you 're for restaurants being able to label meals they just stick in a microwave as ` home made ' ? 
  i 'm not sure if ` monstrous ' is the right word , as that implies something negative about it . 
  that thing is definitely revolutionary , though . 
  top of the line . 
  we do n't really pay attention . 
  sadly . 
   you keep going from moving to travelling no , i 'm not . 
  you 're just not reading it right . 
  i was talking about moving since the beginning . 
  although it would also become harder to travel around the eu once we leave it . 
   are you saying that there were elections that would have had their results changed if the scottish vote was n't included ? 
  can you show me one ? 
  because i can show you the proof of what i 've said if you 're looking to be embarrassed . 
  go on , then . 
  when it comes to elections , scotland never votes tory . 
  scotland leaving will increase the percentage of votes tories get as a result . 
   meh that 's an opinion but if this `` political colonisation '' has been in full force since the 80s , and hardline tories are still more liberal than liberal us democrats , i 'd say it has n't been very effective !, 
  looking at all the bad stuff from the thatcher years , the nu labour years , and the current administration , i 'd disagree . 
  the growing inequality between rich and poor , the government and media trying to pin the blame on ` the other ' ( it 's all single mothers / immigrants / benefit scroungers fault ! ), 
  the housing crisis due to the glut of privatisations , the list goes on . 
   if you believe that the uk leaving the eu is suddenly going to make it impossible for british citizens to travel to european countries then you 're out of your mind . 
  i did n't say impossible , i said harder . 
  because we 're in the eu , do you know what i need if i wanted to move to another eu country , to live or work ? 
  a passport , and an eu card . 
  that 's it . 
  if you honestly do n't think that it would be harder to move to another european country if we were n't in the eu , then it is you who is insane . 
   not a single general election result would 've been altered by the scottish vote in our entire history ; do n't believe the scaremongering , bullshit . 
  tory influence just ** does n't exist ** in scotland . 
  if scotland leaves , the conservatives only grows stronger and more resilient , since a huge proportion of people who would never vote for them leave the system . 
   and the tories are n't even close to the us democrats nevermind the gop so relax . 
  true , but they seem to want to take us in that direction . 
  they 're actively trying to move us towards that system . 
  it started when thatcher introduced reaganomics to britain in the 80s , and it 's been continuing ever since . 
   good riddance to bad rubbish . 
  fuck me for wanting to take advantage of the eu 's ease of travel while i still can , right ? 
  part of me wants to say ` maybe it will galvanise the non-insane british politicians into doing something ' but probably not . 
  if anything it will just strengthen the tory hold , and hasten the slide into us-style gop politics . 
  ... god , i have to get off this rock before 2017 , do n't i ? 
  once the referendum happens and we somehow end up voting ourselves out , it 's going to be a lot harder for me to leave . 
  do n't get me wrong , i was n't suggesting that what 's going on is even close to just ` picking fights ' . 
  i just felt the need to point out that no other country gets this ` if you do n't like it / follow all our laws 100 % right off the bat , then leave ! ', 
  nonsense . 
  and if they do , it is nowhere near the level the uk gets . 
  stop acting as if we 're the sole naysayer , and thus the sole reason the eu is n't working . 
  oh come off it . 
  the eu is not universally despised here , and we 're not the only country to pick fights with the eu at some point or another . 
  ( we may only know this because of the spying , but that 's beside the point . ), 
  god , he looks like a caricature of himself . 
  a stunted , baby-headed troll . 
  one that is also a massive cunt . 
  i 'm wondering if the daily mail is going to cover this, 
  i know what you mean . 
  on the one hand : oh no , the us has been spying on us in a horrifying fashion !, 
  on the other hand : hooray , this being discovered means the possibility of europe standing up to the us more !, 
  fine , then !, 
  we 'd just be the democratic union of england , wales and northern ireland . 
  is that what you want ? 
  the duewni ? 
  you monster, 
  to be fair , the first two are hated by everyone and the third is irish . 
  like i said , it 's something i 've merely been speculating about in the past week . 
  besides , i 've still got another year or so of my course to go . 
  well , there 's the fact that ( as said below ) practically everyone in the uk is monolingual . 
  i 'm trying to teach myself german in my spare time , but that 's hardly here nor there . 
  and that bit about savings is a bit of a bitter truth . 
  the cards seem stacked against a poor person who wants to move . 
  you need money to immigrate , and lots of it .
