  so i 'm thinking that to move to a different country , i 'd need to spend years ( if not decades ) working and scraping by here , and by the time i have enough i 'll probably be too chained down to move . 
   is it still the term ` uk ' if scotland goes for independence ? 
  y-yes , but the full name will have to change . 
  it 's currently ' * the united kingdom of great britain * ( which is the island that contains england , scotland and wales ) * and northern island * ' . 
  it 'll have to change to ' * the united kingdom of england , wales and northern ireland * ' , i suppose . 
  you have to remember though , that most shows that run for 20 + episodes in a season have a huge team of writers . 
  for most british stuff , you 're looking at less than a dozen . 
  such small runs also has the benefit of making the programme less likely of being dragged on until it sucks , ala the simpsons . 
  the ready availability of comedy , and the fact that it is omnipresent within our culture ( rather than being something that is turned on or off for certain events ) on the other hand , i dislike how isolated we are from europe , politically and culturally . 
  i 've been thinking lately ( read , idly daydreaming within the past week ) of immigrating to the mainland once i 've finished my it course , but from where i 'm standing going to mars seems less daunting . 
  i know that fox news has a token brit . 
  that might be him . 
  i believe it was him who was using stephen hawking to attack healthcare reform , by saying stuff like ` under the nhs , he would have died long ago ', 
  `` eu can not into currency , europe ! '', 
  i can imagine all the people who use linux are high-fiving each other right now . 
  i went with belarus , for the dictatorship angle . 
  oh , piss off china . 
  you 're not fooling anyone with that talk . 
  do n't use ryan air for that . 
  it 's a scumbag company that would shove people into an empty cylinder of a plane like animals , if it could get away with it . 
  it also carries the benefit on not strapping yourself into a tin can and using controlled explosions to fly through the air at hundreds of miles an hour , all the while breathing in other peoples farts . 
  while america did keep britain from starving , and its presence in the war ended it much quicker and cleaner than it would have otherwise , there 's nothing to suggest that america was the sole reason that the allied forces won . 
  also , do n't kid yourself into thinking you did it out of some altruistic motive . 
  you charged us for those loans at such a rate we only paid them off back in 2006 . 
   which is why you 're not typing in german right now ** nope ** . 
  fuck ** right ** off . 
  you just lost the right to be taken seriously , with your ` if it were n't for us you 'd be speaking german ! ', 
  up with this sort of thing i shall not put . 
  english should become the official secondary language , methinks , with no first official one . 
  much friendlier . 
  you may be sons of bitches , but you 're our sons of bitches . 
  point out in the helicopter rulebook where you 're not allowed . 
  bit of a lost cause , i think . 
  see , this whole nsa thing is one of the reasons i 've gradually become pro-eu over time . 
  i do n't like the fact that the us has such power and influence over us . 
  i dislike the fact that my government is essentially their laptop , and will bend over backwards all for the ` special relationship ' that feels more and more like an abusive one . 
  while we and europe may not always be on the same page , at least we 're all reading the same bloody book . 
  i suppose ` tries ' is the keyword here . 
  for fuck sake . 
  in american law , treason is defined as supporting and giving comfort to the enemy . 
  what snowden did was reveal nsa surveillance to the american public . 
  are the american people therefore the enemy ? 
  him being here would , to put it simply , bugger things up right proper . 
  the us will want us to extradite him right away . 
  if we do n't , the ` special relationship ' ( ugh ) is buggered . 
  but if we ** do ** agree , on the condition that he is n't tortured or killed ( which we have to , it 's in our laws ) and then find out he has been ( which he will be , even if they do n't intentionally do it the us prison system is bad enough that it counts as inhumane by the standards of , say , norway ) the ` special relationship ' will be buggered because the us has shown they ca n't keep their side of a bargain . 
  damned if we do , damned if we do n't . 
  bearing in mind the stuff that their nsa has been up to , i do n't think we should go through with this free-trade thing any more . 
  go for it , france . 
  it 's about time we stood up to america on something , and you 've a history of doing it . 
  i. . . must admit , i do this too . 
  it 's like watching a car crash on demand , you know ? 
  also [ this ] ( http://www.themediablog.co.uk/the-media-blog/2013/01/daily-mail-turns-the-creepiness-up-a-notch.html ) yeah , i , just . 
  the sun is arguably more outright sleazier ( since it still has a page 3 and all that ) but the daily mail is much , much worse . 
  it is the top of the shit heap . 
  it is the literary equivalent of the worst of fox news . 
  daily mail . 
  the daily mail is easily the worst newspaper in britain . 
  it makes things up ( islamic gets off with killing his girlfriend because he did n't know it was a crime !, 
  polish dentist pulls out all her cheating boyfriends teeth !, 
  and so on ) and what it does n't make up is just evil . 
  off the top of my head , there was that primary school teacher who was transitioning into a woman , who ended up being harassed by them ( including an immensely disrespectful article from richard littlejohn ) and ended up taking her own life . 
  everything is the fault of immigrants . 
  or muslims . 
  or ` benefit cheats ' . 
  or women . 
  or a combination thereof . 
  and everything either gives you cancer or cures it . 
  and they have a habit of printing article showing off lots and lots of risque material while simultaneously talking about how sick and wrong it is . 
  also [ stuff like this ] ( http://dmreporter.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/charlotte-paedo.jpg ) . 
  they also supported the nazi party , back in the day . 
  not sure if that 's worth anything . 
  we supported him mainly because he was n't a republican nutcase , and seemed halfway decent . 
  seemed being the key word here . 
  jeez , i turn around for two seconds, 
  yes , because it 's their fault . 
  hang about , how long have you been a mod ? 
  norway stood up to germany . 
  it may have been invaded , but it never stopped resisting , and the work of the norwegian resistance was vital to the allies eventual victory . 
  off the top of my head , the sabotage of the heavy water production facilities at vemork . 
  one could argue that norway is / was just as small as sweden , if not smaller . 
  norway did ** not ** put up with that shit . 
  sweden did not have to . 
  true , but it 's also worth noting that no other species has our intelligence and population range / density / numbers, 
   yes , homosexuals are deviants , and no matter how hard they will try to lobby to make petiole call it `` sexual orientation '' , they will always remain deviants . 
  if we 're making the ` it just aint natural ! ', 
  route , i feel the need to point out that homosexuality is prevalent within the [ animal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexual_behavior_in_animals ) [ kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior ) . 
   and it seems that you do n't want to acknowledge that a gay marriage is not equal to a normal marriage , because it lacks the procreative function . 
  so married couples who are infertile or childless by choice are therefore lesser ? 
   in that respect it 's similar to marriages with children or animals , as i pointed out earlier so married couples people who are infertile , or do not want a child , are the equivalent of zoophiles / paedophiles ? 
  your twisted logic , not mine . 
  you 've offered no evidence that homosexuality is the same as wanting to fuck animals or children . 
  instead you 've offered a lot of ignorance and bigotry . 
   if you 've got nothing to hide , you 've nothing to fear !, 
  okay then . 
  take all your clothes off , right now . 
  also , take down those curtains . 
  in fact , move into this glass house we 've built for you . 
  see , the toilet is right under this giant spotlight . 
  oh , we 're also going to need to see all of your paperwork ?
