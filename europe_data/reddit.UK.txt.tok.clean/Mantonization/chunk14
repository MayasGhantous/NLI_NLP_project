  bank statements , entirety of internet history , text messages , things like that ? 
  and we also need you to loudly state whatever thought is currently in your head . 
  do n't agree ? 
  why not ? 
  what have you got to hide ? 
  i am referring to sweden 's stance during ww2 . 
  you seemed pretty content to let germany have a go at world domination then , so i 've little idea why you 're saying ` we ' when you say we need to stop germany thinking third time 's the charm . 
   it is important that we all make sure the germans do n't get any ideas about world domination again said the bloody swede !, 
   and local intelligence or law enforcement got a court order to access some of that data yeah , that 's not what prism and such is all about . 
  they already have all your data . 
  regardless of whether a local authority or court order has requested it . 
  regardless of whether you 're a us citizen or not . 
  and yet they are n't . 
  america does n't ** care ** . 
  it literally could not give a fuck that it is n't following our laws . 
  it 's time we put our foot down on this . 
   i do n't think that the conservative main-stream would deny birth control to women . 
  yet that 's what they 're doing . 
  on the other subject : if a foetus is incapable of feeling pain , thinking , or incapable of living outside the mothers body , then it is not a person . 
  it has the potential to be a person , but at that moment in time it is no more than a collection of cells . 
  the person you linked to killed individuals after they had been born . 
  you 're saying that the chicken is the same as the egg . 
  the right to birth control and abortion is ` the right to murder own children ' ? 
  you honestly believe that ? 
  and north korea 's full name is the democratic people 's republic of north korea . 
  off the top of my head , the gop are the party that are trying to limit women 's reproductive rights . 
  some of them are trying to make miscarriages illegal . 
  i 'm not going to claim to have all the answers , and i admit that i do n't know what much on the subject . 
  i just think that ` shoot all the badgers , because some might give tb to cows ' is n't that well thought-out a solution . 
  can we not just inoculate cattle ? 
  yes , because she totally sometimes votes for the wrong thing because she 's distracted by her child . 
  women , eh ? 
  we do n't eat or wear them , so why shoot them ? 
  the proposed cull to stop tb is a very slash and burn solution . 
  using a czar bomb to crack a walnut . 
  there are guys who drive around in britain in old tanks all the time , so this should be a cinch . 
  is ... is it legal for normal people to own one ? 
  i want one , if it only costs only $ 900 ! . 
   eventually the patent lapses and generics are released . 
  except that does n't happen without government intervention , because companies do what is known as evergreening, 
   you can give billions to the people , and they will hoard it . 
  that 's not true , though . 
  people spend their money . 
  on food , clothing , paying the bills , luxury goods , etc. 
  the rich and the banks hoard their money overseas . 
  the average person does n't . 
  about bloody time !, 
  a country is not like a household . 
  you ca n't just spend less and then suddenly have more . 
  you need to also put money into the economy , to get it circulating and creating wealth . 
   the main reason why french people wo n't speak english is usually either that they ca n't at all , or that they suck so much at it that they 're ashamed . 
  wait , what ? 
  that 's the exact reason the british do n't speak ** any ** foreign language ever . 
  you ever seen a brit try to speak french ? 
  you 'll know when it happens , because he gets this harrowed , ashamed look on his face just before . 
  i think that should a referendum actually happen , we 'll end up staying in . 
  big business benefits too much from it to let it slide , and then they and murdoch will end up meeting , and the newspapers will suddenly start begrudgingly pointing out all the good the eu does . 
  not that murdoch would want britain out of the eu anyway . 
  whatever would the daily mail complain about then ? 
  tumblr is not the only place on the internet where you can use bold or italics to emphasise your point . 
   legally possible , you simply change the law to make it legal . 
  tha - but - ** you ca n't do that ** !, 
  you ca n't just say change the law to punish someone every time you come across someone you do n't like !, 
  not only is that ** hugely ** immoral , but it sets a dangerous legal precedent ( which are big things over here ) that would be grabbed with both hands by any would-be fascist and used extensively . 
   do you think the people deported to australia were not british citizens ? 
  are you ** seriously ** advocating that we return to the mindset of the british empire ? 
  seriously ? 
  what you 're doing is the equivalent of advocating witch burning by saying `` oh , well they did it in the past , so it 's okay ! '', 
  it 's already spoken as such across europe , more than any other language . 
  come on . 
  it 's a fictional language spun out of whole cloth . 
  it 's the same sort of thing as klingon or elvish . 
  except klingon has millions of people who actually speak it . 
  oh , please . 
  * klingon * is a more legitimate language than esperanto . 
  i think the eu should have no official first language , but should have english as their official * second * language, 
  so let me get this straight . 
  you do n't watch it , you do n't know anyone who does , but you think you 're an authority on whether it 's a cultural connection between european peoples or not ? 
  confirmation bias , methinks . 
  that 's austerity for you . 
  the rich get richer , the poor get poorer , and germany ends up better than ever again . 
  seriously . 
  i 'm mildly fond of the idea of the eu , and as a country i admire germany , but there 's no way this does n't look bad for them , pr wise . 
  it 's not that surprising that places like greece and italy are so angry at them . 
  murdoch 's not stupid . 
  if all the business leaders are for staying in , so will he, 
  haha , oh no , we 're not falling for that !, 
  a foreign country actually ** liking ** us ? 
  pull the other one , it 's got british-empire era bells on . 
  seems to be working in portugal . 
  also , it seems to be only banning * branded * refillable jugs, 
  hence the ` needed work ' line . 
  see , this article is good . 
  while it does n't cite a source ( but at least gives more of a hint as to where to find one ) it actually explains why it is being proposed , instead of just quoting tory mps saying ` is this a joke ? ' . 
  the policy needs tinkering obviously , but at face value it makes sense . 
  olive oil is prone to widespread fraud , and some places use refillable bottles to pass off cheap stuff as the real deal . 
  the majority of the 27 support it , and it 's hardly a new thing either since it points out that portugal has had it since 2006 . 
  also , notice how the only opposition they 've quoted there is from ukip ? 
  you 've got to consider the angle there as well . 
  that sounds perfectly reasonable .
