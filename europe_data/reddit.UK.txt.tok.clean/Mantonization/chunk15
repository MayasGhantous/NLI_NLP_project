  right-wing newspapers deliberately misinterpreting eu stuff ? 
  never !, 
  give me another source . 
  otherwise this is up there with straight bananas . 
  first off , it was america who evicted them with the uss lexington , after the little settlement there had been pirating off the us navy . 
  second , we owned the islands before 1830 . 
  hell , we owned them before argentina was even a country !, 
  sorry old chap , but argentina does n't have a single leg to stand on . 
  maybe i 'm mistaken , but i 'm sort of under the impression that a news station would n't let people who are biased in their work ( or at least , biased in a way that they do n't like ) work for them . 
  so following that logic , either al jazeera itself would is anti-eu , or it 's not very good at moderating itself . 
  / pol / editing aside , you can tell that this comic was made by an american . 
  that stereotype there wearing the ` kill whitey ' shirt does n't really exist here , and no actual brit would wear an ' i love britain ' shirt or wear that many clothes with flags on them . 
  they 'd be laughed at in the street . 
  the tuition fees thing did n't help , really . 
  i suppose you could use it as a representation of the majority of the lib dem 's performance . 
  they make a huge promise on doing something , gain lots of support , then immediately end up doing that thing anyway without even trying to hide it . 
  no nuclear-wielding country is going to be invaded by another nuclear-wielding country . 
  it 's like if you go to a restaurant , and everyone chips in what they bought for the bill , and then one guy buys the most expensive thing , pays for it , and then says `` why are n't you guys paying as much as me ? 
  this is unfair ! '', 
  france 's business is war , and my word they do their business . 
   endangering the alliance 's viability , its mission and its relationship with the united states . 
  well , it 's nice for them to put what it 's really about in the first paragraph . 
  they 're not concerned about us europeans or our abilities to defend ourselves , they 're concerned about the fact that we do n't share america 's interest in pissing our wealth down a giant military hole . 
  nato is outdated now , it was made as a counterpoint to the ussr , back when there were only two global powers . 
  it needs to accept that that world has passed , and either change to fit the current one or fade into the past as well . 
  besides , because we 're all cutting our military does not mean we 're less of a threat . 
  the uk is the 4th biggest spender , france is 6th , germany is 9th and italy is 10th . 
  those plus all the other eu countries spending , adds up to a pretty large amount , which will at some point ( assuming the eu integrates further and does n't fall apart ) all be consolidated together into one military force . 
  i think the problem here is that america looks at its military budget compared to everyone else 's ( it 's bigger than the next dozen countries * combined * , and instead of thinking ` ours is so high , what 's up with us ? ', 
  they think ` everyone else ' is so low , what 's up with them ? ', 
  i was n't correcting your language ( to my knowledge ) , i was just pointing out the flaw of saying ` if they 're value for money why do n't they show us x ? 
  ' , by pointing out that it 's basically the same as that bullshit statement ` if you 've nothing to hide , you 've nothing to fear . 
   if they were value for money then surely they would n't ? 
  if they had nothing to fear they 'd have nothing to hide , you mean ? 
  turing on the # 10 . 
  come on treasury , make it happen . 
  put it this way : imagine you 've a hedge in your garden , that is growing too large . 
  it 's overflowing , sucking up too much nutrients and sunlight and is generally bringing the whole place down a bit . 
  what do you do ? 
  trim it down to an acceptable level , right ? 
  thatcher opted to burn the entire thing to the ground and salt the earth . 
   do you think the people with college degrees are posting that kind of stuff ? 
  the thing is , that 's not what makes the news and reinforces the stereotype . 
  i assume you mean ` the people with college degrees ' to mean ` the people who know where the czech republic is ' ? 
  if so , your sentence makes little sense , since ** of course ** people who know are n't going to be posting that sort of thing . 
  they have the internet . 
  they have google . 
  to me , this seems less like a lack of education and more a celebration of it . 
  torturing is going a bit far . 
  being caught does n't cause any permanent damage to the fish ( if you do it correctly , that is , instead of just ripping hooks out ) and whether they can feel pain in any meaningful way is dubious at best . 
  well , yes , but it does n't cause them any permanent harm . 
  fish are pretty tough . 
  people are n't supposed to take the fish home to eat . 
  it 's fishing for pleasure , so you 're supposed to catch and release . 
  so because people pretend to be something acceptable to get away with something unacceptable , we should ban that acceptable thing ? 
  is that what you 're trying to say here ? 
  a coincidence in regards to what ? 
  if you mean in regards to thatcher being pm , then yes . 
  the main economic reason for the soviet union collapsing was their arms race with the us , which they could ill afford with everything else they had going on . 
  they had been reaching their breaking point for a while . 
  it 's not like they took one look at thatcher 's beak and dropped their hammer and sickles in terror . 
  she took the public water , electric and rail utilities and sold them off to private companies . 
  the majority are now foreign owned , and prices have never been higher . 
  she sold off council houses and did n't bother to build more . 
  there 's a record low in available housing , and house prices are higher than ever . 
  she crushed union power , and introduced ` fuck-you-i-got-mine ' reaganomics to britain . 
  the difference between rich and poor has never been higher . 
  how do you think i feel ? 
  ( p.s. 
  she opposed the reunification of germany ), 
   my nation and the other ones which were behind the `` iron curtain '' should feel more or less indebted to her for the fall of communism across europe . 
  bull . 
  shit . 
  she did n't do a goddamn thing in regards to communism falling . 
  the soviet union collapsed from within due to economic and social pressures, 
  well , then . 
  ding dong the witch is dead , i suppose . 
  the lady 's not returning . 
  they 've extended bbc news to stop the ` look north ' segment coming on , apparently . 
  probably because they know the majority of reactions up there are n't sad . 
  can we blame the eu for this , somehow ? 
   because we 're not paying them . 
  they give it us for effectively free . 
  ** they 're ** the ones paying ** us ** to be here . 
  so long , and thanks for all the dosh . 
   the market is nothing more than the sum of decisions made by people . 
  that does n't make it infallible or moral though , since not everyone within the process has an equal amount of power , and not everyone has benevolent or neutral intentions . 
   the market is a balance that has emerged based on individuals making free choices on how to spend their own money . 
  this seems to me like the fairest and most democratic way to determine the value of something . 
  ` the free market will fix it ' , right ? 
  that 's not how it works in real life , unless you replace people with robots . 
   according to you , on the other hand , the better way is to override that collective determination of value and instead arbitrarily decide how much footballers `` deserve '' , based on a subjective , unquantifiable sense of fairness . 
  i take it , then , that you 're against these recent caps on banker bonuses ? 
  i mean , they make that money via the market , so therefore it 's perfectly reasonable for them to have it . 
   because that 's what the market has settled on for their remuneration while the rest of your argument is sound ( although i protest the stalinist connection you 're trying to connect to the left , with that ` bread and circuses ' line ) . 
  this part i 'm disagreeing with . 
  while that may be what ` the market ' ( vague as that line is ) accepts , that does n't mean it 's right . 
   why are you introducing a moral component into all of this ? 
  because if left purely to its own devices , the free market is not a good thing . 
  it 's a cause of misery and inequality .
