  hence why we have restrictions on it , such as ( off the top of my head ) health and safety laws . 
  the moral component has already been there for over a century in regards to ` the market ' . 
  so tl ; dr they should earn more in a week than ( say , a nurse ) earns in a year , because they 're too stupid to survive in the wild ? 
  that 'd be nice . 
  i 've long been of the mind that the sort of money that gets thrown around in football is indicative of what 's wrong with society . 
   the uk does not have a history of democracy . 
  the magna carta ? 
  we had a civil war over democracy vs autocracy , and in the end democracy won . 
  when it comes to democracy in europe , we were ahead of the curve . 
  centuries ahead of france , for a start . 
  ( well technically we ended up with both , a constitutional monarchy , but the point still stands ) . 
  ** why ** who would do this ?!, 
  i mean seriously !, 
  the sort of depths some people will stoop to absolutely boggles my mind . 
  haiku 's are easy but sometimes , they make no sense refrigerator, 
  likewise , mine was of joke . 
  joke went fly over head , like cloud . 
  those in glass houses , denmark , should n't detonate hand grenades . 
  rover and mittens , i guess . 
  although ` cosmic creepers ' is recognisable as a cat name , too . 
   you 're a fucking idiot . 
  first you laud it and now you back peddle . 
  no , i pointed out that ** nowhere did i say the system is perfect ** . 
  ** nowhere did i say that the rehabilitation model would lead to crime being extinct ** . 
  you were putting words in my mouth , and then arguing against those words . 
  you are creating a strawman . 
   if you wo n't recognize faults in the criminal justice system where did i say our criminal justice system was perfect ? 
  fucking where !, 
  go on , point it out !, 
   i 'm sure if the justice system had always been about rehabilitation then crime would 've gone extinct by now . 
  because that 's how things work no , because ( as i stated before ) our system is not perfect . 
  and even if it was , since our society is not perfect there would be new criminals . 
  you 're being disingenuous again . 
  once again , you 're making logical fallacies . 
  when it comes to the point that you 're literally wishing that crime happens to the one you 're debating with , i think it 's time to step back , take a deep breath , and think for a little while about just what you 're hoping to achieve . 
   a great system it is . 
  career criminals laugh at the sentences . 
  the laws of society are a joke . 
  arguable  it does n't deter nor does it rehabilitate all pretenses aside . 
  objectively wrong , we have a somewhat decent rehabilitation rate , although far from the best . 
  the best one is norway 's , who are even more about rehabilitation than us . 
   i hope you get caught up in the mix . 
  `` you disagreed with me , therefore i hope some sort of horrible crime happens to you '' wow . 
  are n't you a champ ? 
  oooh , are we just quoting at one another ? 
  an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind !, 
  ( also , what kind of nonsense is that ? 
  mercy is a fundamental part of our justice system , since it 's based on rehabilitation rather than vengeance ), 
   even with the normal tax they already pay a lot more than poor/middle class people . 
  yes , but after that ** they still have a lot more money than poor/middle class people ** . 
  they pay more because it 's a percentage , which is fairer than a flat rate . 
  so acting as if they 'll somehow be rendered worse off than poor/middle-class people is disingenuous at best . 
   and you 're not here to judge whose money are made by skill , if he follows the law it 's none of your bussiness . 
  you claimed that the sole reason rich people are so is because they are somehow more ` skilled ' at the game of life . 
  i pointed out that that is incorrect . 
  even if we ignore the fact that ` skill ' is such a subjective word as to be meaningless , if it were true people like plumbers would earn more money than , say , snooki . 
  besides that , a lot of rich people inherited their wealth . 
  hell , the wealthiest woman in australia ( forget her name , she owns a bunch of gold mines ) inherited all her wealth . 
   calling it a `` social contract '' is like some stupid phrase out of a shitty left-wing propaganda . 
  so what do you fucking call it , then ? 
  you put money into society via taxes , and that pays for roads , emergency services , national defence , education , laws , social safety net , and so on . 
  you obey the laws society sets , and you reap the benefit ( in theory ) . 
  if that 's not a social contract then what the fuck is it ? 
   if you were to judge this we would be living in a communist state . 
  what are you , a philosopher ? 
  who the fuck needs a philosopher these days ? 
  give me 90 % of your money . 
  logical fallacies and left-wing godwins ahoy !, 
  side note : so much for ' i do n't feel like arguing ' , eh ? 
   well , yeah , but we have been all playing the same game . 
  they just play better than others and are punished for it . 
  there are two things wrong with this statement . 
  first , tax is n't a ` punishment ' , it 's part of the social contract . 
  second , the idea that rich people are so purely because of skill is fallacious and just plain wrong . 
   therefore , if the society were an relevant reason to achieving wealth , everyone should be wealthy . 
  that 's ... not how society works . 
  or economics . 
  it 's like a pyramid . 
  you ca n't just have the pointy bit at the top . 
   logically , the real difference between a wealthy person and a poor person is most likely a difference in skill , as easy as that , and therefore the one responsible is only the person who accumulated the skills necessary to achieve that goal . 
  again , that 's not how the world or economics works . 
  i 'm amazed you can even make that claim . 
  if the only factor in wealth was ` skill ' ( however the hell you define that ) , then people such as nurses or plumbers would be paid more than those famous people who are famous only for being drunk on telly and fighting / getting their kit off . 
  yes , i am saying that snooki is prove that you 're talking shite . 
  the argument is that they only got where they are because of the society they are in . 
  nobody gets anywhere purely by themselves , the whole ' i got here without any help ! ', 
  viewpoint is nonsense . 
  everyone in society contributes to keep it running and help others be successful . 
  then someone had the clever idea of proportional tax , where the more you have the more you pay in . 
  because a flat rate leads to much higher income inequality . 
  you have to remember that the difference between taxing the poor 50 % and taxing the rich 50 % , is that the rich will still have much , much more money than the poor at the end . 
   edit : i wonder why this is such an unpopular notion ? 
  because maybe we do n't advocate the idea of kidnap and rape ? 
  fucking seriously . 
  i 'd go vegetarian , but at this rate i 'm liking to find eyes in my chips . 
  this post is very revealing about the american mindset . 
  ( and hitler was austrian anyway ), 
  and god help you , you unfortunate bastards . 
  it was , though . 
   dae think politicians lie ?
