  what my view is does n't really matter , i just dislike this idea of cutting someone loose because they 're having some problems . 
  i just find it a bit hypocritical , considering that the us had multiple states night bankrupt in its infancy , yet it did n't throw them to the metaphorical wolves . 
  i do n't see the us kicking out states when they prove to be in economic trouble . 
  well can they hurry the hell up ? 
  it 's the middle of march and yet freezing cold !, 
  good for * one * thing ? 
  it ended the feudal system in britain , since there were so few workers they could sell their labour for a decent price !, 
  it also killed so many people that the increase in tree numbers ( due to the decrease of loggers ) lowered the earth 's average temperature slightly !, 
  those bastards !, 
  that 's our shtick !, 
  * not sure if i 'm allowed to talk here , but to hell with it * english is a mongrel language . 
  it has been from the start , when it evolved from a pidgin language developed between the norman conquerors and the anglo saxon conquered . 
  it became the dominant language in the british isles after the black death , when the majority of the french speakers ( which included all the important positions such as the courts both royal and law , and the monasteries ) died out . 
  our words and rules come from pretty much everywhere , but in general the simpler a word is in english , the more likely it is to be germanic in origin . 
  more complicated words are more likely to be french , and the most complicated words latin . 
  a good example of this is ` ask , question , interrogate ' . 
  also it can be very easy to learn ( especially since we do n't apply genders to everything , like france ) but quite difficult to master , since as it 's a mongrel language it 's a mish-mash of esoteric spelling and grammar rules . 
  the pope . 
  telling the british what to do . 
  yes , well , good luck with that . 
  also , this sort of puts the pope in a compromising position . 
  no matter if he says he 's against or for argentina 's claim , he ends up making a lot of people unhappy . 
  this sounds really interesting . 
  i may just take this up at some stage in the future . 
  the thing that i 'm pleased to see is that it provides voluntaries with food , shelter and even an allowance while you 're doing it . 
  that 's fantastic , because without it only rich people or people with rich parents would be able to do this . 
  just fyi , the telegraph is right wing and eurosceptic . 
  it 's jokingly referred to as the torygraph . 
  i do n't think they would be part of this system you claim exists . 
  so why did we tell them !, 
  it was literally a victimless crime !, 
  you know that gun from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy , that when you shoot someone , they instantly understand your point of view ? 
  my wish is kind of like that . 
  that suddenly , everyone gets everyone else 's views on the eu and why they feel them . 
  iceland is where europe gets the majority of its bananas , i believe . 
  good . 
  i think we 've reached a certain point where he have to seriously look at our society , and cause some big changes there . 
  we need to get past this idea of just paying bigger and bigger amounts of money to people at the tops of companies as compared to the bottom . 
  a more fairer bottom worker / top ceo pay ratio leads to a fairer society . 
  there were no indigenous peoples to displace , britain has claimed the falklands since before argentina even existed , and the people on the democratically voted - in a way that is recognised and accepted by the international community - to remain an overseas territory . 
  what the fuck do you want , huh ? 
  maybe this show of fairness and democracy will be enough to convince kirchner . 
  ... pfffttthahahaha i 'm sorry , i ca n't say that with a straight face . 
   well germany is responsible for ww1 first off , it 's ` was ' . 
  second , i 'm pretty sure that 's not historically accurate . 
  well , the markets might take a hit , since s korea is a tech giant of a country . 
  for god 's sake , america !, 
  well , this took a turn for the wurst . 
  the economic crisis did n't happen because everyone was drunk , or they were too busy driving nice cars . 
   that 's ridiculous , if workers are n't free to choose for whom they want to work , it 's not a free market . 
  china resembles more corporativism where there 's only freedom for the employers and big businesses . 
  i 'm not talking about workers choosing who to work for . 
  i 'm talking about rules , regulations and rights businesses have to follow . 
   that 's not a free market , if it was free , workers would have the right to leave through the front door and simply not come back . 
  they 're allowed to leave . 
  they 'll starve if they do , since they 're caught in constant wage slavery , but they can still leave . 
   the workers in china are so free they 're not even allowed to kill themselves . 
  in case you were serious , no , they have no freedom in that regard . 
  but it 's still a free market , no ? 
  none of those ` regulations ' or ` rights ' to bog down the glorious invisible hand !, 
   you 're right , they wo n't , but it 's their own life , you ca n't run it for them . 
  i believe that freedom should end when you start using it to fuck over another person . 
  same thing with businesses . 
  the free market should not be free enough to cause a situation where companies put suicide nets around their factories . 
   you just have to let it operate freely and allow every individual to pursue their own separate interests . 
  is n't that the sort of thing that 's led to the horrendous workers rights in china ? 
  if you let people do whatever the hell they want , guess what , they wo n't all act magnanimously . 
  `` the free market will fix it ! '', 
  not if they 're past their use-by date though . 
  you 'll give yourself the trots . 
  by stereotype , i mean the sort of thing 4chan makes greentext stories about . 
  or / r/murica edit : while we 're on the subject :  europeans have really stupid stereotypes of americans . 
  you really ca n't use ` europeans ' in the same way we say ` americans ' . 
  it 's just not the same . 
  be that as it may , it was kinda funny in the ` this is what americans actually believe ! ', 
  stereotype way . 
  `` if you get to vote in your elections , then so do we !, 
  cuz we 're america , and we invented freedum ! '', 
   if you can vote in your elections , we get to vote in yours . 
  erm ? 
  is this revenge for western betrayal ? 
  because we 're all ** really ** sorry about that . 
  please stop . 
  plz, 
  ** do n't jinx it man !, 
  it would be a kick in the teeth to the ` we 're all the same !, 
  we 're all european and should stop thinking of individual countries ! ', 
  crowd , to be sure . 
  a bunch of new states breaking off to form independence would certainly embarrass them . 
   they want out , i can see that . 
  but why do they have to try and destroy it to be out of it ? 
  if they hate europe so much they should at least be making vague motions at reforming it rather than just dragging their heels every where and making the eu even worse than they believe it is . 
  by making it worse , not only are they creating more reasons for leaving the eu ( `` look how bad it is ! '' ), 
  but they 're also sabotaging it for the benefit of an independent britain . 
  they do n't want us in , but they do n't want an economic superpower on our doorstep either . 
  why would you ** not ** want more democracy in the eu ? 
  cut down on bureaucracy , more transparency ( no secret voting ) and no more unelected officials . 
  ( i 'm speaking from a uk perspective here but you can apply this to any country ) the standard view is something like `` it 's bad enough that foreigners who do n't know a thing about my country and care even less are telling us what to do , but they 're unelected as well ? '', 
  does n't like a democratic union . 
  sounds a bit like an empire .
