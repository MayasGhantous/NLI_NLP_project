  everyone benefits from that though , since we 're awful at foreign languages and we know that you 're all just cringing on the inside every time we try to speak them . 
  hellooo ~ it makes sense , right ? 
  that way everyone can communicate , but ~ ~ you all get to stick with your godless foreign languages ~ ~ everyone gets to keep their own language !, 
   the price you pay to become a federal state i guess , years of grinding misery in order to balance competitiveness across the eurozone . 
  that 's like shooting everyone in the kneecaps , just so the man with one leg has a decent chance of winning the race . 
   nations across europe keep voting for politicians who continue with this policy . 
  we vote for politicians who say they wo n't , then do it anyway . 
  or we vote for them despite their austerity views , not because . 
  yes , the bankers are the pinnacle of socialism !, 
  well , then , hopefully this is only the beginning !, 
  electric cars are now extremely decent and will only continue to improve , but are constantly hamstrung by a lack of facilities and a public perception that they have n't improved since they were first thought of . 
  neigh , i say !, 
  well that 's ea -  beside your mother language ah . 
  hmm , well . 
  i like german , i guess ? 
  it 's very logically structured , and the rules like nouns being capitalised means i do n't have too hard of a time figuring the sentences out , such as my knowledge is . 
  and i must confess , i do have a weakness for the accent . 
  jesus_christ_how_horrifying . jpg what 's being done about this ? 
  what can be done about this ? 
  ugh , the comments in / r/worldnews ... 
  assuming horse meat becomes a ` thing ' here , we 'll probably end up turning it into a british dish and exporting it to france within a decade or two . 
  we export curry to india for god sake . 
  for god sake , this again ? 
  ** the complaints are not because the meat was horse ** . 
  the complaints are because it was being sold as beef , and that such a deception could have nasty consequences ( since horses not bred for eating can have a tonne of nasty stuff in them . 
  what kind of misdirection bullshit is this ? 
  `` oh what does it matter , horse meat is lovely ! '', 
  it bloody well matters when i buy a beef lasagne and find it 's 60 - 100 % doped-up horse !, 
  i 'm just going to copy my response from / r/unitedkingdom  the entire idea of lobbying - literally paying politicians to fight for the policies you want - is bad enough to begin with , and is completely ( and i would argue inherently ) undemocratic . 
  but what 's even worse is that these are ** american ** lobbyists . 
   they are not in or affiliated with the eu in any way . 
  so why are they trying to buy democracy off to change eu data protection proposals ? 
   because they do n't want our data being protected . 
  they want to use it to screw us over . 
  these are the same people who are pushing for acta , sopa , whatever bloody acronym it 's called nowadays . 
  these are the people who are warning about ( read : threatening ) a trade war with the eu , simply because the eu is trying to keep the internet and people 's data on it free . 
   these american corporate lobbyists ** are not on your side . 
  they do not give a fuck about you , at all . 
  ** they are trying to bribe their way through purely for their own benefit . 
  they want money , power , and any threat to them or their american corporate hegemony ( like , say , data protection laws ) destroyed . 
   this comes across as somewhat preachy i know , but i ca n't emphasis it enough when i say ** these people are not your friends . 
  that 's great . 
  good for them . 
  lucky lucky old * germans * . 
  could n't have happened to a nicer bunch . 
  quite so !, 
  this lion may be older and less spry than it used to , but it still has claws !, 
  plus they 'd be fighting the polish . 
  they 've no chance . 
  i know you 're trying to paint it as a bad idea , but yes something like that . 
  or alternatively - since there 's no legal difference between the two , just religious - call them all ` marriages ' . 
  you can add ` religious ' or ` non-religious ' to the front if you want . 
  if there 's nothing important about the name , then why not ? 
  call all state-sanctioned partnerships hetero , homo or otherwise one thing , and all religious ones another . 
  makes it simpler , no ? 
   here 's my suggestion : the state should be involved in sanctioning civil partnerships , gay and straight , full stop . 
  then if anyone wants to go and get a ` traditional marriage ' they can do what they like outside the aegis of the state . 
  sure . 
  but if that 's the case , only marriages that take place in religious buildings with religious people should be called marriages . 
  while it has existed since those times , it 's something that has almost certainly been kept around since roman times because of the prevalence of christianity . 
  on top of that , keeping something a certain way simply because it 's always been done that was is a logical fallacy . 
  regardless of the religious aspect , look at it from a secular , governmental standpoint . 
  why should n't gay people who are in love be entitled to the same benefits as a hetero couple ? 
  and calling it something else like a ` civil partnership ' is not only disingenuous ( since plenty of non-religious people get married ) but it promotes a ` separate but equal ' form of thinking ( which is bs ), 
  it 's crazy though . 
  does he think marriage does n't exist outside / before christianity ? 
  it 's still got to go through some kind of committee ( who wo n't be able to do shit due to the overwhelming majority in favour of this in the commons ) and then through the lords ( who wo n't do anything since they 're in favour of it . ), 
  so not now , but soon . 
  i feel that while you 're not wrong , this line of thinking can lead to hyperbole like :  how dare you complain !, 
  you no longer have to worry about dying of smallpox or wolves before you 're ten !, 
  stop being so entitled !, 
  it 's the same sort of reasoning that leads to hatred towards poor people because they own fridges , and therefore are n't ` really ' poor . 
  we should ask how well people are doing relative to the baseline good of the day , not by comparing how well we 're doing as compared to the past , which is ridiculous . 
  while this is a good point , i think that this sort of thinking leads to easily to hyperbole . 
  yes , things are better than they used to be , since we now do n't die of smallpox or wolves by the time we 're eight or whatever . 
  but the question is how well are young people doing relatively speaking ? 
  surely not !, 
  we already have food printers , after all !, 
  mit has its cornucopia , for example . 
  ** good ** . 
  great work europol . 
  we appreciate it . 
  it 's amazing the sort of new technologies and possibilities 3d printing has created . 
  do you think that whole idea of ` make food using algae ' is now a reality , or soon will be ? 
  just print the stuff out in chips , or whatever . 
  my cynicism is blaring like a foghorn . 
  a prominent figure in a huge german bank , supporting cameron ? 
  one that would undoubtedly benefit from the flight of business if britain does leave the eu ? 
  surely not !, 
  i believe the view held is based on nostalgia of past glories and self hatred as much as hatred of europe , and goes something like :  `` we 've been unconquered for nearly a thousand years !, 
  we used to rule a quarter of the world !, 
  we used to be great britain !, 
  and now we have to beg the french and germans for help ? 
  and be ruled by the belgians ?! '', 
  * `` german feds say : ` britain 's opinion is wrong !, 
   and most uk immigrants speak it . 
  and i 'm not complaining about them . 
  at all . 
  not in the slightest . 
  see !,
