  stuff like that !, 
  that is what i am against , that sort of thing helps our society in no way . 
  ( and * mate * , how the hell do you remember your username ? ), 
  so assuming all our politicians get involved in a fatal money-diving accident , and we become more integrated with the eu , will there be things stopping this sort of nonsense from happening ? 
  i 'm not really sure if there 's a proper word for what i 'm talking about . 
  ironically , there 's probably one in a foreign language . 
  i 'm not sure i 'm using the word right . 
  what i meant was ` the language they speak most of the time in public matters ' . 
  that means in stuff like shops / employment / government forms and so on . 
  i shall edit my original post . 
   i mean , damn , english is so prevalent :p english ? 
  in britain ?!, 
  pull the other one !, 
  that 's interesting , i guess . 
  so the biggest minority is now poles ? 
  huh . 
  side note , i 'm not sure i approve ^ 1 of the growing number of people living here who speak english only as a second language ^ 2 , or do n't speak it at all . 
  i think that it is not unreasonable to request that if you live here , you learn to speak the language . 
  personally , i blame the fact that our official documents come in every language under the sun , and we offer free interpreters . 
  it does n't help integration / assimilation in the slightest . 
  it just leads to voluntary segregation on the immigrants part , resentment and hatred on the native part , and social unrest overall . 
   ^ 1 by ` i 'm not sure i approve ' i mean ' i do n't approve in the slightest ' . 
   ^ 2 i 'm defining things like ` first / second / third languages here as ` language which you speak the most in regards to public matters ' . 
  stuff like shops / employment / government forms , and so on edit : ffs / r/europe , the downvote button is not an ' i disagree ' button !, 
  who 's on first ? 
  driving on the right side of the road , i think you 'll find !, 
   while the british citizens apply for wellfare unemployment . 
  not for long , the tories are gutting the safety net , and the job centre system regularly breaks men down to tears . . 
  and then what happened ? 
  france quickly lost all of its colonies in america and canada , and right after the war america mostly turned its back on france and become big trading partners of us . 
  i 'd hardly call it a win . 
  a pyrrhic victory perhaps , or a draw . 
  the english slaughtered the french army multiple times ( crecy and agincourt being the most famous , of course ) and led multiple * chevauncees * across the countryside . 
  france may have eventually repelled the english , but they never returned the favour and invaded us in kind . 
  calling it a proper victory is like saying that russia won ww2 because they repelled the germans from their country , and not because they then invaded their country and forced a surrender . 
  1000 years of war ** with the british always coming up on top ** , remember . 
  edit : hmm , it seems facetiousness is not something that can be expressed purely though text . 
  good !, 
  not having drones has set up quite a bit behind , and it 's about time we caught up . 
  strange , i do n't remember him being democratically appointed . 
  thus i do not think his views on us and the eu in regards to democratic issues are worth listening to . 
  no matter if i personally agree with his points or not . 
  you would n't go to a eunuch for sex lessons , would you . 
  and they 're entitled to their opinion . 
  the matter of the fact is ( i 'm just going to use your country as an example , but this could apply to any european country ) we 're not the same . 
  we may all be reading the same book , but we 're not on the same page . 
  our cultures are different , our languages are different , our economies are different , and we 're not even very close to each other geographically . 
  to top it all off , we know next to nothing about each others countries or cultures . 
  why should i have a say in how your country is run , or you mine ? 
  there 's no way i have the necessary understanding of your country or your issues to do it properly ( and vice versa ) , so how is that just ? 
  and do n't just say ` but you 're european too !, 
  / we are the same ! ' . 
  that 's not for you to dictate . 
  if someone does not feel a kinsman-ship with someone else , you simply can not force them to have one . 
  and dictating to them that their feelings on the subject are wrong and that they do in fact have said kinsman-ship will do nothing but drive that person further away . 
  how is it fair that a country that has an entirely different language , culture , economy , and is not connected to my country ( or even connected to the country that 's next to my country ) dictates commands to our country ? 
  that we have to bend the knee to some unelected person who knows nothing about us , probably cares even less , and yet somehow has the gall to tell us what to do ? 
  sounds quite imperialistic really . 
  i 've heard from the comments on / r/worldnews that this only applies to men . 
  can any austrian 's verify ? 
  if so , this seems like a bit of a step back democratically speaking . 
  not that it did n't before , mind you . 
  yes , let 's antagonise the incredibly eurosceptic nation that you somehow managed to get to use your currency . 
  ** i see no way this can possibly go wrong **, 
  if such a referendum were to be held , all of the papers and media held by the murdoch empire ( yes , even the daily mail ) would change their tune and talk about how the eu has improved britain . 
  because the uk leaving the eu is bad for business . 
  question : why is it sweden 's job to fix these people ? 
  ( fix probably is n't the right word , but you get the idea ) . 
  we should n't be using our societies as a sort of moral factory , letting people from third world countries , with objectively harmful views and of little benefit to the economy in , waiting until they cause suffering , and then punishing / possibly rehabilitating them . 
  while it is not good that these people hold these views , and it would be good for them to change , but it is not the job of our societies nor our economies to act as a moral nanny for the people from other parts of the world . 
  look up how their salaries work . 
  ever since a treaty started by king george iii ( that has willingly been resigned by each monarch ever since ) the royal estate gives all of its earnings to parliament each year , and parliament sets it a yearly wage . 
   not really , if i were to move to another country i 'd act in exactly the same way i act here , dress the same as i do here and treat others exactly how i do here and if you tried that in a bunch of countries , you would find yourself in a lot of trouble . 
  also , good fucking luck doing it if you 're a woman , gay , trans , etc etc. 
  adding to this , would you be trying to force the country you moved to do adhere to how you used to act in your home country ? 
   i 'd still continue speaking english at home with my family though . 
  ** and that 's fine ** . 
  i never said it was n't . 
  again , it was in incredibly simplistic terms . 
  and i agree , the gay and women rights things are more universal to western culture and beyond than just british culture . 
  but do you get the general gist of what i 'm saying ? 
  you should n't leave your country and its culture behind , only to try and forcibly turn the country you arrive in into a carbon copy of it . 
  neither can you come into a country , then demand certain rights be taken away from certain people because those rights do n't exist in the country you left . 
   if a foreign footballer were to sign for an english club he 'd have to speak english or is he an exception ? 
  what about a specialist japanese sushi chef hired from japan by a restaurant in london ? 
  if either of these people are living and working in britain or with people who have english as their primary language , then the answer is a resounding yes !, 
  i 'm not saying they need to give up their language at all , but if they 're living or working here they must know ours or be learning it . 
  ( i 'm going to use my country for the sake of argument here ) if they want to live in our country , we expect them to adhere to our culture . 
  that is to say , our social values and our language . 
  this is a very broad subject , of course , which makes it hard to quantify . 
  but to put it in incredibly simplistic terms , if you want to live in our country , you have to learn to speak english and you have to accept that gays and women have rights . 
  well that 's good , right ? 
  if someone immigrates to a country purely to fraudulently claim money off the state rather than work , they should be kicked out . 
   uk according to poland : godless traitors is this about the soviet union thing ? 
  that 's german ingenuity for you !, 
  bring it , you uneducated , oppressing fucks . 
  when it comes to a fight you 'll not find france wanting . 
  just you try it , you northern viking scum !, 
   but you do n't honestly believe that the french are in africa because they care about africans ? 
  not really , no .
