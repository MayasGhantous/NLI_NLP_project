  they 're compromising , they used to want to burn your house down !, 
  how could you not let them burn down one room !, 
  / s time and again it 's been shown that you ca n't give russia an inch , because they 'll take several miles . 
   why would anybody attack lovely old estonia ? 
  we can pillage their internets !, 
  all those precious hundreds of mb/s shall be ours !, 
  nobody gets to suspiciously murder people in the uk but us !, 
  like that suffocated security operative who somehow tied himself up inside a sports bag . 
  honest . 
  aah , see , no . 
  i 'm afraid now that you 've insulted us so , we need to go all walder frey on your continental arse . 
  all of our french teachers had a will of iron and lungs of brass , and one also had fantastic ... tracts of land . 
  we were sort of too occupied at the time . 
  considering that the uk 's banking sector is a ) enormous , and 2 ) greedier than bloody smaug , this is a surprise . 
  things must really be serious !, 
  alright , now you 've just got us suspicious what 's your game here ? 
  jesus , i wish i had n't stopped learning french at gcse ... 
  uh ... something something wonder about russia 's strategic interests , something something how does it immediately effect the eu , euro and nato , something something hon hon hon baguette ? 
  how did i do ? 
  even if we hate you , we 'll offer you a cup of tea . 
  maybe some biscuits , if we have any . 
  how is that not compassionate ? 
  i understand that you tend to get a boner at the idea of violence , but steady on now . 
  looks like someone has n't seen that documentary red dawn !, 
  they 've finally found a solution . 
  i 'm with you there mon ami . 
  i do n't like the implication that your country basically becomes a sideshow for more important ones on their holidays . 
  you ca n't , by design . 
  that 's why the 1st/2nd/3rd world thing is bollocks . 
  anyone who supports america is by definition 1st world , with 2nd being supporters of the ( now dead ) ussr and 3rd world being everyone else . 
  i want to say japan , but at least three of those criteria are things that have happened ** to ** them , so i do n't know . 
   they 're seen more as civil servants most of the time . 
  that 's because they are . 
  or at least , are supposed to be . 
  did n't the edl use that building 's picture to push a ` mega-mosque ' scare story ? 
  i 've met plenty of people who have lived here for generations and are as white as the driven snow , and do n't fit those criteria . 
  are they not real europeans , then ? 
  define ` real ' europeans . 
  i want a cmot dibbler level of quality in my fish and chips , dammit !, 
  question !, 
  since the us has a military budget larger than the runners-up combined , and russia has been left in the dust technologically , would n't america have some form of defence against nuclear weaponry , meaning that it would be hurt a lot less than russia would be in retaliation ? 
  usually because said individuals belief that everyone else is as selfish and un-empathic as they are . 
  the same way thieves are always worried about security . 
  freedom has many difficulties , and democracy is not perfect . 
  but we 've never had to build a wall to stop our people from literally escaping by any means necessary . 
  no one has ever built a hang-glider in secret to escape a ` western liberal ' nation . 
  hah , as if you would n't take that anyway !, 
  as i understand it ( it was before my time ) even though the ira kept bombing , the peace process kept moving forward . 
  and when a prominent member of said ira said they were ready to try peace , britain did n't turn around and say to the n. irish people ` no , get rid of the ira first ' . 
  that 's a bit of a problematic attitude . 
  imagine if during the troubles , every time the british army killed innocent civilians they said it was the ira 's fault . 
  would it help if i said i was very tired ? 
  nono , i got the joke . 
  it was a good one !, 
  i was making the text-equivalent of a side-eye . 
   america  freer eeehhhhhhhhh on topic : i 'm disappointed this article did n't have comments enabled . 
  torygraph comment sections are something else . 
  the daily mail is just stupid , but the telegraph 's are evil . 
  we 're one freeze-ray armed helicopter away from red alert , at this point . 
  i get that he 's being an idiot , but do you have to throw around autistic as an insult ? 
  sadly , since ukraine is not part of nato i do n't think they would . 
  especially since the more powerful yet with the least to lose ( britain , us etc ) would be against it . 
  however , i 'm thinking that there perhaps will be an international response , possibly even from china . 
  them and russia have their spats , plus letting a bigger country just invade a smaller one like that under the pretext of ` peacekeeping ' sets another dangerous precedent that china ( hell , anyone ) would prefer not to exist . 
  exactly . 
  you do n't get germany kidnapping us citizens , taking them to black sites , torturing them and then dumping them on a random road , either . 
  got it in one . 
  i just realised something . 
  is n't al assad the name of the bad guy in call of duty 4 ? 
  the guy running totally-not-iraq ? 
  less than 10 % of the country is built on . 
  it 's not like we 're for want of space for housing . 
   close interaction that 's a funny way of saying ` us english screwing them over ', 
  well , that 's shameful for us . 
  a housing supply kept artificially low by politicians and their mates because homes are seen as a money-making asset rather than a place to live . 
  and any new place that is built is immediately snatched up by bloody landlords , to boot . 
  i 'm a little bitter . 
  especially considering that every morning my family watches ` homes under the hammer ' , which is full of people described above . 
  while i 'll possibly never be able to buy a home in my own country . 
  personally i think everyone who 's ever been on it deserves to be hanged . 
   especially when you see the tabloids laying into the nhs cuts , long waiting times , and countless other scandals ( just try to google `` colchester hospital scandal '' ) . 
  well of course . 
  murdoch is one of those who would benefit from nhs privatisation . 
  i offer ourselves as tribute !,

  not bloody surprised in the slightest . 
   their family is successful . 
  they are part of their family , therefore they are successful . 
  that 's not logically correct . 
  i was trying to go for the whole ` britain is pretty good at fighting people ' angle . 
  fell a bit flat , really . 
  at the risk of inviting disaster upon my house ( i watch got , i know how this goes ) : let them come , americans or no . 
  we 've done it before , we 'll do it again . 
  i ca n't for the life of me remember the title or the author name ( which is frustrating to me to no end , as you can imagine ) but i was given a book by my father about the soviet secret service . 
  it was printed in the late 70s / early 80s by a man who had defected from russia to the west . 
  ** edit ** got it !, 
  ` inside soviet military intelligence ' , by viktor suvorov . 
   fact is , we ca n't both match the us military budget and maintain our social programs .
