  but the point that france was invited , as opposed to invading , still stands . 
  i suppose i walked into that one . 
  there is a difference between one country invading another , and a country sending military forces to help the government of another country . 
  it 's the difference between being invited into a home , and breaking in . 
   not always . 
  when ? 
  it 's not like , say , flying . 
  if you need to use a train to get x location at x time , then there is only one option for you to take , since you ca n't get more than one train on the same line at the same time . 
  just going to get this joke out the way early ... [ http://i.imgur.com/5dxwo.png] ( http://i.imgur.com/5dxwo.png ), 
   why do we get to pick who to save and who we let rot ? 
  mali asked for help . 
  france did n't ` pick ' , unless you 're advocating that france refuse to help any country it may have oppressed in the past ? 
  same applies with trains . 
  oh boy , here we go . 
  comments with the article about how france is anti-business because it ` spends taxes on the lazy ' . 
  read : healthcare and anti-poverty measures . 
  is something like this going to be said every single time my country or france decides to help someone out militarily ? 
  german troops are in afghanistan , yet you would n't say ` ah just like the old days , germany putting on the reich ' , would you ? 
  that 's good , right ? 
  man , that plus the whole ` going up 12 credit levels ' thing really gives you some hope for greece . 
  on a darker note , would n't it be horribly disappointing if golden dawn took control just as things improved , and mucked it all up ? 
  but the tories are on the opposite end of the political spectrum , whereas labour is right next door to them !, 
  and they ended up giving all control to the tories anyway !, 
  bit ironic , considering people may find it equally hard to replace their money of important historical figures with ... bridges . 
  add the hobbit and 1984 to the list !, 
  they do n't even have famous people on them !, 
  i mean , bridges ? 
  seriously ? 
  not even famous ones ? 
  that 's monopoly money !, 
  make english the official ** second ** language of europe , with there being no official first language . 
  again , did n't say that . 
  i criticised the french customs because they know these people camping outside calais are in france illegally , but since they 're heading to illegally settle in britain instead of sticking around they decide to just ignore the problem . 
  which does n't bode well for any future integration or mutual respect . 
  deportation involves sending illegal immigrants back to their home country . 
  you 're not doing that . 
  you 're just passing the problem along and washing your hands of the business . 
  the international equivalent of throwing rubbish into your neighbours garden , rather than disposing of it . 
  it 's pretty much a two party system between labour ( who are drifting towards centre rather than left ) and the conservatives ( on the right ) . 
  this is due to the first past the post system we use , and the problem of gerrymandering that it creates . 
  it looked like the liberal democrats ( left ) could have broken that , but then they formed a coalition with the conservatives ( of all people , i still do n't understand why ) and broke the very promises that got them so much support in the first place ( such as the tuition fees stuff ) so they 've pretty much ruined their chances . 
  as for the number of parties , you can find a list of them [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_parties_in_the_united_kingdom#major_parties_in_the_house_of_commons ) . 
  it seems ukip has been rising , sadly . 
  never said that . 
  show me where i said that . 
  go on . 
  ** bloody well show me ** . 
  the argument is that nobody should be bending their knees to anybody . 
  we catch as many of them as we can on our side , but it 's not enough . 
  we ca n't do that on your side of the channel , since that 's not our country and we sort of assumed that the french would prove competent at doing it on their side . 
  evidently not . 
  i hate how people like him call the uk a police state . 
  they 're the same people who spouted the bullshit that the nhs has death panels , or that stephen hawking would have been dead if he were born british . 
  ( yes , i know , that 's how stupid these people are ) and americans listen to them !, 
  they have huge followings of people who take their word as gospel !, 
  you 've made very good points , and i agree with all of it . 
  but my point still stands . 
  what did you expect ? 
  cameron is a rich upper class scumbag , who 's made a lot of money from how london operates . 
  you did n't seriously expect him to vote for the tobin tax , did you ? 
  ( i feel the need to mention that my own feelings on this are a tad more complicated . 
  while i agree that london is far too financially-based and that the tobin tax is a good idea , i do n't really want my country to suffer economically , since i live here and everything . 
  i think i would need some assurance that my country would n't just go to hell and suffer what greece has ), 
   what do you have against multiculturalism ? 
  or maybe your just a racist fuck . 
  ** stop right fucking there . 
  ** god dammit littlething44 , this is why we ca n't have nice things !, 
  accusing people of racism for not immediately agreeing with you will literally do nothing but kill off any chance of discussion . 
  it is right up there with godwin 's law . 
  explain how in this case , all of these somali immigrants in sweden is a good thing . 
  and do n't just say ` cuz multicult ' because that literally explains nothing . 
  explain what you mean , and why that is good . 
  i managed to state my reasons why i 'm against this ** without ** accusing you of anything horrendous . 
  perhaps you could offer me the same courtesy ? 
  you , er , got any proof of that mate ? 
  in this case ? 
  this does n't seem a good thing . 
  the article says that 9/10 of these people are on welfare . 
  so you 've got hundreds of thousands of people coming to sweden and immediately going on welfare instead of contributing to the economy . 
  and their birthrate is seven times higher than the natives , according to the article as well . 
  what if they refuse to educate themselves , or integrate or follow the laws ? 
  what if the majority of these people are already these things ? 
  just form their own little communities where they never speak the language , and demand their new country bow to their own cultural or religious laws ? 
  we 've quite a few of those people in britain . 
  it 's not a good thing , it 's an economic and cultural time-bomb . 
  i think you need to realise that ethnic minorities can be just as thuggish , idiotic and in need of a good slap round the head as the rest of us . 
   ( their argument of that you 'd have loads more illegal immigrants entering the uk is a load of bollocks as they are currently quite literally arriving by the truckload ) you know why those trucks are arriving ? 
  it 's because the port officials at calais do literally ** nothing ** to stop them . 
  since they 're heading for the uk instead of staying in france , they literally do n't give a shit . 
  stuff like that has to change if you want britain to look favourably upon the continent , because as it stands now it looks like you want us to bend the knee to you , and you 're willing to casually mess things up for us until we do . 
  you mean the tobin tax ? 
  you can lead a horse to water , but you ca n't make it economically shoot itself in the foot . 
  it might also be because for nearly a thousand years , we 've been our own , unconquered country . 
  ( william of orange does n't count , because we invited him and he 's dutch ) and we 've repelled invasion after invasion from europe for just as long . 
  i imagine joining the eu sort of feels like a betrayal of that fact . 
  to go from ` never conquered ' to ` has to listen to what france and belgium say ', 
  i 'm actually against open borders in europe , as least as long as extra money and effort is n't put into tracking down and deporting illegals to compensate . 
  the problem with open borders ( as i see it ) is that the inner countries end up having to rely on the outer countries to stop illegals . 
  if the border officials and customs fail there , then those ` hopping the fence ' can just stroll through europe without hindrance . 
  whereas if border checks were needed with every country within the eu , they would have to face a dozen hurdles or more .
