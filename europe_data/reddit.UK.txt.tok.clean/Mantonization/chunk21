  i would n't want to go further into france , i might come down with a nasty case of culture . 
  you 're probably completely unsurprised by this , but i have n't been abroad much . 
  i 've been to france a few times in my childhood ( on camping holidays near calais ) and to germany once , on a school trip . 
  the germany trip was ... magical . 
  we went to cologne , during the christmas period . 
  and we went to the christmas market . 
  being there at night , amongst the stalls selling clockwork and wooden toys , in the shadow of a black cathedral so tall you had to lean back to see the top , all the while snow gently drifted downwards . 
  it was amazing . 
  absolutely magical . 
  sadly i did n't get to interact with many natives , since it was a school trip and we were on a schedule , but what can you do ? 
  it raises a question of international law , certainly . 
  what if someone goes to a country to do something that is illegal in their own ? 
  should the people in that country be prosecuted ? 
  racism is bad , and therefore this is bad . 
  now we 've gotten that out of the way : that 's some bloody good wordplay is n't it ? 
  again , racism is bad , but seriously . 
  talk about putting some effort into their insults !, 
   the eu seems to have stepped up the pr offensive leading i fucking hope so , because let 's be honest fucking skeletor has a better pr department than the eu . 
  i totally thought this was going to be about a hospital where patients were murdered , or something . 
  not because of the czech part you understand . 
  that was ** him ** ? 
  perhaps , although with kirchner at the helm you can never be too sure . 
  woman 's crazy . 
  nuttier than squirrel poop . 
  i would , but as already stated it does n't exist , so i wo n't . 
  i ca n't tell you that it involves america coming under the power of ultra-nationalist right-wingers either , or that a civil war erupts between them and and the rest of the nation . 
  i also would n't be able to tell you that it involves the us easily gaining ground in the first half due to its multiple bases throughout europe , before being finally pushed back . 
  and i definitely ca n't mention that it involves the eu being driven ever closer together through shared hardship , and after america is forced to surrender ( after russia and china decide to get in the game because hey , why not ? ), 
  it undergoes a softening of culture similar to what happened to japan following ww2 . 
  also espionage , nuclear intrigue , a killer soundtrack by hans zimmer , and all that . 
  i was thinking maybe ` blue dawn ' for the title . 
  i mean , i would be , if this were a real thing . 
  you kidding ? 
  our military was much , much worse in the 80s than it is now . 
  since then ours has got bigger and better , whereas the argentine 's has stayed roughly the same . 
  plus , the falklands now have a permanent garrison of marines , a local militia armoury , eurofighters and a naval patrol . 
  plus , the entirety of argentina is within cruise missile range . 
  all of it . 
  our submarines can literally bomb anywhere in the country if we wanted to . 
  the only way argentina could be a threat would be if america armed them in a bid for cheap falklands oil , in the process starting ww3 between europe and the usa and ** this totally is n't a novel i 'm writing i promise . 
  what makes you think we ca n't do that right now ? 
  what makes you think we need to increase our military budget for that ? 
  ** we have an army right now . 
  ** we 're also the fourth biggest military spender in the world ( with france being the third i believe ) . 
  do we really need to make it bigger ? 
  you seem to act like none of us have defences of our own , and if america were n't around we would be invaded from literally every angle at once . 
   to other more promising defense initiatives . 
  like ... ? 
  what do we have to defend against ? 
   perhaps asking for all the money to be transfered to defense is asking too much , but britain certainly needs to take a hard look at its military preparations . 
  first off , i love how you say ` perhaps ' there , as if spending all our money on defence is a legit , fair idea . 
  second , we 're the 4th biggest military spender on the bloody planet !, 
  what more do you want from us ? 
  i did n't say those were caused by our involvement in afghanistan . 
  i said that the only reason our forces were unable to handle them was because the majority of our forces were in afghanistan instead of available . 
  i may concede yugoslavia , but to my knowledge that was more of an apathy problem than a logistics problem . 
  you have n't really answered my question , in that you have n't explained what we ( i mean we as in britain here , just fyi , although this good perhaps apply to europe as a whole ) need to increase our defence spending against . 
  all of the things you listed we can handle , if the majority of our forces were n't preoccupied in afghanistan . 
  plain , i guess ? 
  just crows . 
  crows are a humble , social bird , that is [ pretty goshdarn smart ] ( http://www.cracked.com/article_19042_6-terrifying-ways-crows-are-way-smarter-than-you-think.html ) . 
  smarter than ravens , even !, 
  you know why ? 
  because crows teach their young things they 've learnt . 
  which is not to say that the crow is harmless . 
  it 's a carrion bird that can be ferocious in a scrap , and has been attributed with death and battlefields for thousands of years . 
  defence from ** what ** ? 
  what is there in this day and age that we need to spend more of our money arming ourselves against ? 
  what enemies are we facing that our current military can not stand against ? 
  if americans want to cut their defence spending - fantastic !, 
  please do !, 
  you do n't need it to be bigger than the next 14 countries combined , and that money could do some great social help in your country !, 
  but do n't act like you 're the sole thing keeping us between freedom and destruction . 
  the cold war ended over 20 years ago . 
  i always thought the crow would be a better bird for the eu . 
  the market may be free , but it 's should not be free to fuck over society . 
  likewise , while people in europe have freedom , we should try our hardest to make sure that does n't include the freedom to starve , die of easily preventable illness , get stabbed , etc etc. 
   the uk is by far the most morally deprived country in the western world i fucking wish !, 
  maybe my romantic life would be better !, 
   david cameron 's `` crazy '' plan to repatriate powers from brussels will allow paedophiles and criminals to run free , europe 's most senior justice official has warned . 
  yep , this ** totally ** is n't just an attempt to scare / blackmail britain into the eu . 
  ** no siree ** !, 
  call me a cynic , but the moment any government figure uses the threat of paedophiles , i tend to switch off . 
   the european arrest warrant ( eaw ) was opposed by mr cameron when the legislation enacting it into british law passed through the commons 10 years ago . 
  under the warrants , britons are automatically deported to the eu countries demanding their arrest , even for crimes that are not an offence in britain . 
  does this apply to criminals who have fled a country to britain , or a brit that 's done a crime abroad , or just any brit who 's done anything in britain ? 
  if it 's the very latter one then that 's horrifying , and the equivalent of the uae extraditing foreigners for drinking alcohol in their home countries . 
   `` the uk needs this because its citizens do . 
  the whole discussion of opting in or opting out is against the interests and rights of british citizens , '' she said . 
  on the contrary , i would believe that a debate on the future sovereignty of our country is very much about the interests and rights of our citizens . 
   he said the whole european project could fall apart if all member states only looked out for their own interests . 
  * cough , cough *, 
   nobody 's forcing you in it 's an intellectually dishonest view that we can simply leave at any time , or that we have no ties keeping us in . 
   either show some commitment funny how ` showing commitment ' means ` going 100 % with the group , with no dissent ' to you . 
  no other countries gets this flak . 
  we are far from the only country that complains or tries to bend things towards their own benefit . 
  hell , look at france and their cap . 
  you do n't see ** a single fucking comment ** in this subreddit saying how ( to continue this example ) france ` needs to commit ' or ` need to decide if they 're in or out ' whenever they push for their own thing . 
  but the moment britain does anything , hold the phone !, 
  stop the presses !,
