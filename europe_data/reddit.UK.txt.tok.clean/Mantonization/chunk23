  i 'd just like to know that the eu is worth its salt when it comes to stopping the governments of member states being dumb / evil babies . 
   why would you report a post if you knew it did not meet the criteria for moderation ? 
  that 's no - that 's not what i said in the slightest !, 
  are you intentionally missing my point here ? 
  i 'm saying that our current moderation policy is ** fine ** , and that if it does n't work at the moment , it is ** not ** because our moderation policy is too soft , rather that people are not enforcing the policy adequately by reporting comments . 
  there 's a difference between our current moderation policies and draconian moderation policies . 
  not all moderation is draconian , but all draconian moderation is moderation . 
  see ? 
  and as i stated before , and will do so again here . 
   ** if they break the rules , report and move on ** we have rules in place to deal with these sorts of comments . 
  the fact that they 're not being enforced does ** not ** mean we should bring in draconian moderating policies . 
  it means we should ** report them ** . 
  people are allowed to have a differing opinion . 
  and yes , that includes things like `` i think x culture is superior '' or `` i think immigration is bad and here 's why '' if they break the rules , report and move on . 
  otherwise , either ignore or debate them !, 
  just banning people you do n't agree with will turn this forum into an echo-chamber ( more than it is already ** lol ami rite guiz ** ) . 
  maybe if you engaged in debate , you could change their mind . 
  or maybe they 'd change yours . 
  either way you 'd both learn something . 
  tl ; dr : i suggest you * ta gueule * and grow a thicker skin . 
  if we can manage it , i 'm pretty sure they can . 
  * must ... make ... snide comment * okay , but seriously though . 
  what 's causing this drop , and how do we stop and reverse it ? 
  a couple . 
  number one is probably france . 
  because come on , we 've been fighting each other ( and us winning ) for nearly a thousand years !, 
  we ca n't ** not ** be brother countries after something like that !, 
  special mention goes to the dutch , for william of orange . 
  it 's a shame , really . 
  but the politicians seem to want us out , the mindless masses ^ 1 want us out , and at this stage probably everyone else in europe wants us out too . 
  god knows they 're not trying to convince us to stay in . 
  also , i heavily disagree with this line . 
   and one certainty : that having once departed , it would be all but impossible to get back in again . 
  please , france ( and maybe germany ? ), 
  would love for us to crawl back , for them to be able to look down and say `` well well well !, 
  look what the cat dragged in ! '', 
  1 : i 'm working class myself . 
  by ` mindless masses ' i mean the kind of person who reads the daily mail and believes every word . 
  who thinks vaccines cause autism , that benefit scrounging foreigners are giving our kids cancer , that something something diana , also brussels says bananas must be straight . 
  really , i think we could use another war . 
  a large , outside threat that we all need to band together to defeat is just the thing needed to bring us all together . 
  maybe russia could give it a go ? 
  ooh , or america !, 
  that 'd be different !, 
  say it starts with a republican president invading the falklands for our oil , and then it all snowballs from there ? 
  * yes , i am being facetious *, 
  no it is n't !, 
  irony is when the * opposite * of what you expect happens !, 
  if a cat is scared of mice , * that * is irony . 
  hungary being the fattest country in europe is not . 
  they 've got a point . 
  france is horrendously protectionist . 
  and before anyone says anything : hypocrisy does not automatically render a statement invalid . 
  although this whole situation stinks , i 'm hardly afraid of a repeat of 1930s germany . 
  if someone did try to repeat such a scenario in greece , they would be swiftly and easily smacked down by , well , everyone . 
   sava savanovic what is * that * ? 
  the serbian equivalent to john johnson ? 
  okay , but where 's it coming from ? 
  is it being passed around by increased drug use ? 
  sexual contact ? 
  or are more people already with the disease living in europe than previously ? 
  hooray we have drones !, 
  bloody finally !, 
  we need to the technologically advanced faction here !, 
  we ca n't match the brute strength of the us or the zerg rushes of china !, 
  if i were a daily mail reader or something , that would be a perfect line for me to say ` yeah , i wish you 'd go back to your own country ! ', 
  or something . 
  but i 'm not , so i wo n't . 
  bloody hell . 
  people do n't view miliband as a leader , but at the same time nobody seems to like the conservatives . 
  the nasty party brand seems more prominent in the public consciousness than ever . 
   all i see is merica benefiting from chaos it 's creating by diving russia and europe . 
  it 's not america that 's dividing russia and europe , and i do n't know what makes you say it is . 
  it 's most definitely * russia * that 's causing a division between russia and europe . 
  have each ... blast , what 's the word for the building a national leader lives in ? 
  like with our prime minister and no . 
  10 downing street ? 
  well , just put a big holographic conference room in each of those . 
  [ security council of s.h.i.e.l.d style ] , but better lit ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/b/b0/image4kir.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120519081112 ) . 
  which is ancient ** and ** boring !, 
  best of both worlds !, 
  it 's harder to exploit others when they 're happily getting along . 
  i think some in the west have this strange idea that us being on top and taking advantage of everyone else is somehow a natural or deserved state , and something to be desired . 
  which is pretty messed up . 
  it 's similar to how africa was divided up , right ? 
  the national lines in africa were intentionally created by european powers so that no side would have stuff like an ethnic majority , to ensure that there could n't be a united effort against colonial rule ? 
  or something like that ? 
  my plan if britain ever enters schengen involves starting each day drinking in a capital , and waking up next morning in a ditch , on the border of a neighbouring country , with a man whom i do not recognise but who insists we 're best friends . 
  repeat until i 've seen the whole continent . 
  or my liver shuts down . 
  whatever happens first . 
  as i understand it , it 's less about the mines itself and more about the fact that little was done for the affected areas afterwards . 
  some places still have n't recovered economically or socially . 
  we do n't trust the politicians we 'd be replacing them with . 
  that 's a great quote . 
  very revealing . 
  if you want to avoid undue suffering , that 's ... not how it works . 
  at all . 
  prosperous people have less kids . 
  poorer countries have larger families because they need kids to work or take care of them .
