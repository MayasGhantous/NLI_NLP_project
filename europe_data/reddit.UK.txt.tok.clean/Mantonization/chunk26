   why ca n't the uk have both identical trade agreements and open borders without having to participate in a vast political organization that has a direct say in uk domestic policy ? 
  you 're essentially asking ` why ca n't the uk have all the perks of eu membership without any of the responsibilities ? ', 
  and while yes , it is technically possible , i do n't see it happening . 
   so secure identical trade agreements removing the tarrifs for both parties , and strip security back to stage it is currently at . 
  you want to have your cake and eat it too , then ? 
  no , but we would have to pay tariffs . 
  plus as clusterfack has noted below , there 'd be additional time build ups due to things like border security , etc. 
  the problem , of course , is that the british public does n't know shit about fuck . 
  remember that ipso mori poll from a year or so ago ? 
  the ** u ** nited ** s ** hared ** s ** tates ( with dear friend ** r ** ussia ! ), 
  funnily enough , yes . 
  these days i actually trust the eu more than i do my government . 
  i get the impression that it actually gives a damn about me , despite the character flaws of not being rich , a media baron , banker , foreign oligarch or combination thereof . 
  i 'd love to hear some soviet works !, 
  there was this list of soviet sci-fi films on the guardian that i 've been meaning to work my way thorough , but have never gotten around to it . 
  i 'm actually not sure if i 've read any , sadly . 
  is there any russian sci-fi you 'd recommend ? 
  the cat thing was complete bullshit , iirc . 
   the translation takes a bit out of it , it 's quite powerful in norwegian . 
  that 's fascinating to hear , could you explain why ? 
  oooh do n't call them english , it makes them mad !, 
  i 'm surprised lucifer wants to let the old girl go . 
  motherland is like crucible . 
  men either become hard like steel , or burn like ash . 
  ash soaked in vodka . 
  would it be a weird question to ask if romanians like tom cruise ? 
  like , how germans apparently love david hasselhoff ? 
  i perhaps get the impression that when ( if ) a referendum draws near , a bunch of big usiness leaders may meet with murdoch and say `` alright , fun 's over '' and see to it that more positive stories are released . 
  ignoring the fact that the bbc does n't do adverts , what ads ? 
  like what ? 
  were other channels running something of the sort ? 
  the right accuses it of being left . 
  the left accuses it of being right . 
  a legitimate criticism would be that is slanted slightly towards the establishment ( whoever they may be at the moment ) , but they 're pretty unbiased . 
   there is no end scenario that has us in a federation . 
  it 's just not going to gel with our culture and history . 
  i 'm not really sure that 's true , since ( at the very least ) you could have very much said the same about france . 
  or germany . 
  oh no , my secret love of shooting aliens !, 
  exposed !, 
  you cad !, 
  ooh , ooh !, 
  do me !, 
  do me !, 
  the problem , of course , is that nukes are bit deadlier than guns . 
  so much so that countries with nukes could probably do whatever the hell they wanted to countries without , if other nuke-wielding countries did not intervene . 
   if we were n't here , you euros might never hear american viewpoints on issues of culture and world affairs . 
  true , your cultural viewpoint is so rare to find on the internet . 
  even on reddit it 's near impossible to discover !, 
  because liking it would mean showing sincerity and positive emotions . 
  which is n't like us at all . 
  hence the emphasis on * sort of * . 
  i can * sort of * understand german , in a ` wo ist die kartoffel salat ' sort of way . 
  it seemed alright . 
  i did * not * expect an article with that title to appear on the telegraph . 
  its owners must be getting worried that its ` eussr ' scaremongering may actually produce results , not just sell papers . 
  at least the us one gave us amy 's baking company . 
  on the one hand , a resurgence of asshole-russia . 
  on the other , perhaps closer eu integration . 
  hey , do n't blame me for having to step up and do your work !, 
  bleeding outrage , is what it is !, 
  grumble grumble !, 
  you best czech yourself before you wreck yourself . 
  `` command and control '' by eric schlosser . 
  a bit chilling , to be honest . 
  as is tradition . 
  hacking into al quaeda websites and replacing their bomb recipes with cupcake recipes is fun , but it 's not like the old ussr days . 
  this makes me particularly sad , because it seems that tunisia was the one country that had a perfect result from the arab spring . 
  it 's hard to do that when they have a worldview that is consists of nothing but corners . 
  like a belligerent m.c. 
  escher painting . 
  well sure , but the harrier did it decades ago . 
  music from the cold war is pretty neat . 
  [ here 's another i like . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xpzichxxoq ) [ and this one . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhh_z7rgcek ) [ this one 's good too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o18_5vhbfva ) [ here 's one that was pretty damn controversial at the time . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab-ojlq5rwo ), 
  i know the f-35 has been a disaster in terms of budget and expectations vs reality , but that is one sexy looking plane . 
  in either case , it 's an important lesson . 
  if you give up your humanity to reach the top , do n't be surprised if others do n't want to stop you from falling . 
  i seem to recall that stalin died of a stroke . 
  he was in bed , and nobody checked up on him ( and potentially saved him ) when he did n't show up at his usual time because the last man who had woken stalin up was purged . 
  [ now hold a boombox over your head and blare this out of it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llaxjq-fk9s ), 
  do you have any more ? 
  we do n't really have any putin jokes over here . 
  please do n't compare me to jihadi jonn . 
  thank you . 
  it 's a difficult situation , to be sure . 
  especially since there 's always that spiteful little voice in the back of your head saying `` fuck that kid , maybe if he was n't such a little shit he would n't have it so bad . '', 
  it 's a notion complete devoid of empathy or a basic understanding of how reality work , but it 's one you get nonetheless . 
  mental sewage , if you will . 
  `` if one man calls you a donkey , ignore him . 
  if two call you an donkey , think about it . 
  if three men call you an donkey , buy a saddle . '', 
  during the ussr they still did that . 
  and chess champions , to boot . 
  russia seems to be like that stereotypical child you know could be the next einstein or picasso , but may never reach that potential because they come from a shitty home full of drugs and violence , with no support . 
  i 'm going to be honest : i 'm a fat coward of a programmer .
