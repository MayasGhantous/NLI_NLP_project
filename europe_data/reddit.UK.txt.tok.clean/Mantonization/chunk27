  i 'm not exactly guerrila material . 
  however , i would definitely at least hold signs . 
  `` fascist oppressors out of my country '' , `` down with this sort of thing '' , etc. 
  do n't forget ` later having a dutchman become king in a revolution that did n't have a single battle in it ' . 
  the ` any ' is redundant , i believe , as you 're already using the singular word for children . 
  `` 20 % of women do n't have a child at all '' or `` 20 % of women do n't any children at all '' would both be correct . 
   either all speech is allowed , or none is . 
  otherwise it is a slippery slope . 
  oh come on now , that 's clearly not true . 
  shouting fire in a crowded theatre , etc. 
  oh please . 
  keep your outrage in the_donald . 
  if people complained about him to police , they 're obligated to at least check it out . 
  unfortunate as you may think it is , they ca n't just laugh it off and refuse to . 
  someone complained , they investigated , they said `` oi mate , stop being a racist prick '' , and * nothing else is going to come out of it * . 
  he 'll be released with no charges , i guaran-fucking-tee it . 
  probably not . 
  it turns out a lot of racists are n't bright enough to distinguish between sikhs and muslims . 
  if he said that shit in public a policeman would pull him aside and tell him to cut it out . 
  he does n't get a free pass because it was said on the internet . 
  a lot of people are just reading the title , i think . 
  he then went on to make a bunch more tweets , including calling people towel-heads , and also made such comments on his company 's facebook page . 
  this tweet was just the opening shot, 
  i 'm choosing to remain salty about all this . 
  for all its faults , at least german has an alphabet , and is somewhat phonetic . 
  and is n't french . 
  i 've never really thought about it . 
  i guess it 's to point out that the verb is connected to the subject ? 
  i would say it as `` which district do you belong to ? '', 
  but then again , i am from the west country ... 
  some of the sentences are absolutely ridiculous though . 
  just to pick a random one from duolingo :  zu welchem bezirk geh\u00f6rst du ? 
  the literal translation - `` to which district belong you ? '', 
  - sounds nuts . 
  it 's almost completely backwards to how it 's said in english , and i can not help but get salty over this . 
  and they have three different ways of saying ` the ' , and two dozen bloody ways of saying ` a ' that all depend on the gender of the object ( again , * chairs do n't have genders , what the hell is this * ) and the time of day and whether your aunt ate sausage in the last eight bloody days . 
  we have two ways of saying it : ` a ' and ` an ' . 
  you use the latter if the noun following it starts with a vowel sound * and that is it * . 
  none of this unnecessary nonsense . 
  we did a little bit of it in school , but i 'm just trying to learn it now . 
  you get some sentences that have no verbs or anything for 80 % of it , and then they 're all just thrown in at the end . 
  it 's silly . 
  and i will ** never ** understand why other languages still give genders to everything . 
  it 's a chair !, 
  it does n't have a gender !, 
  ** why do you do this to yourselves ?!, 
  right , yes , stuff . 
  thank you . 
  german 's a fun language . 
  if they got rid of the ridiculous genders and stopped with the ` putting all the important words at the end ' business , it might be as good as english . 
  never ! ), 
   luftkissenfahrzeug uhh ... air-something-drive-tool ? 
  questions for the romanians : - how fast of an internet are we talking ? 
  - how easy is it to learn romanian ? 
  blair , left ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  he was neoliberal . 
  a tory in a red tie . 
  oh good !, 
  nice to see a little sanity . 
  on the subject , what happened to that estonian that russia kidnapped on the estonian side of the border ? 
  or a mathematician, 
  `` the country is fucking fucked '' i love these subtitles, 
  hey , you 're the proud warrior race guy in this relationship . 
  i 'm sure you have , no need to worry . 
  can never find the bloody thing all in one piece on youtube , though . 
  [ part 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=robswkqa7og ) [ part 2 ( ish ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oldk2c25z14 ) [ part 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-bimxb4za8 ), 
  oh no , do n't worry , i 'm mostly joking as well . 
  when i was writing that post all i had going through my head was that monty python sketch about the british officer and the tiger . 
  nah , you do n't . 
  we were n't there . 
  you just wish for the * idea * of it - that is , the idea of it that 's mostly just us glorious white brits being sedan-chaired around india or china or whatever , shooting tigers and wearing pith hats and oh are n't the natives just * darling * . 
  things are much better now . 
  less likely to be killed by tigers , for one . 
  and thank god for that . 
  but they 're only doing well because of the opposition . 
  or to put it another way , they 're working * in spite of * the autocracy if deng had n't put himself in a position of opposition to authority ( mao ) he would never have created the reforms he did . 
   but is n't autocracy in general a very effective system of government ? 
  i 'd argue that it generally is n't , because you end with leaders who are n't crossed even when they 're being insane . 
  see : stalin . 
  or perhaps a better example would be mao effective government * needs * an opposition, 
  yes !, 
  it finally happened !, 
  so happy . 
  i love videos of people trying foods / stuff from other countries for the first time . 
  this stuff is fascinating and i could watch it all day . 
  you can tell things are serious when even the germans want to get involved . 
  chin up !, 
  the year is still young !, 
  that reminds me , has that giant goat that always gets set alight been put up yet ? 
  16 and pregnant ? 
  that 's a thing , right ? 
  what about tlc with its toddlers and tiaras ? 
  about a fifth of the world 's entire population is of muslim faith . 
  what , exactly , do you propose ? 
   3 minutes ago the reported 100 hostages inside the bataclan are being slaughtered one by one with a shotgun for over an hour , according to various reports . 
  / u/slyratchet are you kidding me ? 
  are you bloody kidding me . 
  jesus fucking christ on a bike . 
   at the end of the day it comes down to whether you trust your government more than you trust other organisations .
