  how is he not british ? 
  the whole ` croatian person really hates serbian people ' i can understand ( if not condone ) , but what 's your beef with ukraine ? 
  cool . 
  now we 've got that cleared up - can i ask for a source for your figures ? 
  also , while we 're at it , sadiq khan is british . 
  he was born in britain , and his parents are british citizens . 
  this is the origins of the catalan separatist movement , is n't it . 
  by british do you mean white , by any chance ? 
  nice . 
  if only we could do the same with blair . 
  have you read asimov 's ` the evitable conflict ' ? 
  you should , because i think that 's basically the idea you 're describing . 
  one i personally support . 
  uhh ... ` thank you something donbass something president something something something ' ? 
  damn , i thought i was better at this . 
   a defensive one are you serious ? 
  apart from the fact that this agreement you speak of does n't exist , those eastern european countries joining nato ** is their choice ** . 
  nobody forced them to join . 
  ** nothing ** about that justifies russia 's illegal annexation of crimea , supplying of ` seperatists ' in east ukraine , shooting down that airliner , etc. 
  nah , they 're about on the money our government is awful about that sort of thing, 
  i ca n't imagine living in such a place !, 
  you 'd have to make sure all your bedroom windows are south-facing , with thick curtains , surely ? 
  i 've been having weekly skype calls with a guy in russia , helping him improve his english ( and him my russian ) . 
  i 've learnt that : - tea is big in russia , but coffee shops are starting to take over - in st petersburg , some of the year the sun never sets fully below the horizon, 
  are you perhaps thinking of [ the behaviour sink , and john calhoun 's experiments on mice ? 
  ] ( http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-rats-turned-their-private-paradise-into-a-terrifyin-1687584457 ) i feel like employing people to dig ditches and fill them back in makes no sense . 
  even with full automation there would still be work - even ignoring maintaining the machines . 
  some businesses may employ people because they want to . 
  `` genuine human-made !, 
  '' , that sort of thing . 
  but the important thing will be that people wo n't * have * to take the jobs . 
  think of how many people alive today could have been the next picasso , or einstein , but never realised their full potential because they were born into poverty , or are spending all their time working multiple jobs just to get by . 
  with technology freeing people from their drudgery they can pursue their own interests and reach their full potential . 
  it 's a problem , to be sure . 
  i 'm optimistic that we 'll improve , though . 
  we 've always been getting better as a species . 
  side note : would you recommend * the space merchants * ? 
  i 'm always on the lookout for good sci-fi . 
  i 'm a little confused as to how you go from `` your goal is impossible ( so do n't bother ) '' to `` your goal is a good one that i support '' within one sentence . 
  anyway :  but equal prosperity for all , as in outcome equality , if that is what you mean , is not only impossible but is a dangerous ideal to pursue , not to mention a highly dystopic and tremendously damaging psychologically and socially . 
  i disagree with this , but i think that 's because we both have different things in mind when we think of outcome equality . 
  when i think of it , i think of things like healthcare ( everyone deserves to have the equal outcome of adequate medical treatment ) and education ( everyone deserves the equal outcome of an adequate education ) . 
  things we already kind of have , with compulsory school for kids and healthcare systems like the nhs . 
  i feel like a lot of people who argue ` equality of opportunity , not outcome ' fall into the just world fallacy and assume that everyone has the same privileges in life that they had . 
  i 'm not accusing you of that , you understand , i 'm just saying that 's how others come across to me as . 
  you do n't need a bloody revolution to ensure equal prosperity for all . 
  this is n't a binary choice between ` mao 's communist china ' and ` dark satanic mills-brand capitalism ', 
  then what do you suggest ? 
  at the end of the day ( and to use another analogy ) , if i have to choose between a star trek future and an elysium one , i choose the former . 
  even if i 'm one of the rich people in this situation , i choose the former , and will fight for it . 
  dictators gaining control is as inherent in communism no more than slavery and oligarchy are inherent in capitalism, 
  do n't be facetious . 
  i 'm not advocating purges and you know it, 
  already there brother !, 
  also on / r/fullcommunism, 
  ~ ~ and that 's where the communism comes in . ~ ~ ~ ~ the fully automated luxury gay space communism . ~ ~ ** edit ** i 've actually been thinking about your post since i saw it , and i think i believe that , in such a situation , it would be best to remove those people . 
  i do n't necessarily mean kill , but certainly take the machines away from them . 
  allow me a hyperbolic analogy to explain my thinking : say you 've got a village full of people . 
  everyone has their jobs and does their work , your basic capitalist stuff , and everyone 's doing okay . 
  when suddenly , someone goes and invents a replicator from star trek . 
  the need for work is over , because you can make everything instantly with the replicator . 
  with that , money becomes a bit meaningless too . 
  but then a rich person goes `` the inventor was working for me , therefore the replicator is mine . 
  and nobody is allowed to use it unless they agree to work for me ! '', 
  the rich person then goes on to essentially makes slaves of everyone else , because they own the replicator and therefore all of the power and prosperity . 
  do you see where my logic is heading , here ? 
  i feel like in the situation you 've described , those people who the robots are like the rich person with the replicator . 
  and that person should be overthrown . 
  but that obviously ca n't work for everyone . 
  even if we ignore the fact that some governments just wo n't do anything to help with that ( see : thatcher and the north of england ) . 
  how about we work less ? 
  if we can now produce more and more stuff with less and less labour required , why do we need to keep working so hard ? 
  technology is supposed to free us from drudgery . 
  not impoverish us and then just pass the drudgery onto our children . 
  mussels and chips . 
  plus an extremely healthy love of arguing and general distrust of government makes you proud to be friends , it does, 
  that 's what they 're saying . 
  the argument is that capitalist societies had to be more equal in the 20th century to survive , because communism existed as a seemingly viable alternative . 
  without concessions to the working class , the labourers could potentially revolt and get rid of the rich in favour of communism . 
  the argument continues that since the collapse of the ussr and the supposed discrediting of communism ( see ` end of history ' and all that nonsense ) capitalist systems have no reason to treat people fairly , and will begin to strip them of their rights and equality . 
  you do n't get people saying that capitalism has been discredited because of what happened during the industrial revolution , or during the period of russia following the collapse of the ussr , or pinochet 's reign . 
  but dictators gaining control of communist societies is proof that communism is inherently bad ? 
  i 'm not advocating for or against communism here , just pointing out that this argument only ever seems to swing one way . 
  ** edit ** : actually , wait , you kind of do . 
  every time someone points out the malicious aspects of capitalism some right-wing arse usually says `` but it 's not a truly free market  :[ '' . 
  they 'd then usually go on to say how removing all regulations would somehow not end up with child labour , or something to that effect . 
  it 's fully possible that both theories have their strengths and flaws , right ? 
   `` but i was spanked and turned out fine '' . 
  you were lucky . 
  i would argue they * did n't * turn out fine , because they turned out believing that beating children is a good idea, 
   that 's a shitty plan considering that eight ( ! ), 
  planned terror attacks were stopped last month alone . 
  excuse me for being cynical , but i 'm not going to just take the intelligence service 's word on that , considering the misconduct they 've been up to . 
  you 're absolutely right that there has to be a balance between freedom and security . 
  but unless you believe that removing privacy and indefinite detention without trial are both okay , you 'll agree with me in thinking that we 've swung way too far in one direction besides , snooping on everyone all the time has been proven to be ineffective . 
  you ca n't see the woods for the trees . 
   yes , let 's also stop being so interventionist and making middle eastern problems our problems . 
  let 's be more isolationist and focus on bettering ourselves instead of elsewhere . 
  i would n't say isolationist , but yes to the not being interventionist . 
  no more foreign wars under flimsy pretences .
