   well fear is a natural response , we are n't cold logical beings . 
  we are emotional , you can try and pretend this is n't true but it 's going to happen whether you like it or not . 
  sure , but the important thing is to not let that fear rule us . 
  norway definitely had the right idea after the breivik killings . 
  they did not become a less free , less open , less welcoming country for it . 
  they stuck with their values , rather than destroying them in opposition to someone who hated them for those values in the first place . 
  sounds like a plan !, 
  let 's go back to how it was before . 
  before we started snooping on our own citizens and locking up people indefinitely without trial . 
  before we started giving up our freedoms in the name of a supposed security that never seems to actually keep us safe . 
  let 's stop being so ** afraid ** , for christ 's sake . 
  we 've been bombed by a better class of bastard than these . 
   common sense ` common sense ' is a nonsense term used by those who believe that everyone should think the same as them , but lack the intellectual capacity to back their arguments up, 
   and yet somehow most of those left wing students become staunch conservatives later in life [ citation needed ], 
   sorry but given that we have n't actually won the war on terrorism the war on terror is something that can not be won . 
  always has been . 
  it has no concrete end goals and no means of achieving what murky goals have already been ascribed to it without destroying the very thing the war is apparently supposed to protect . 
  typical of his sort, 
  if i attack a toystore in december , does that mean i 'm attacking christians ? 
  that 's ` areas where majority voted remain vs. areas where majority voted leave ' , really, 
  come on mate , it 's been an hour . 
  answer / u/shamalamadindong such as ? 
  yes , because that 's totally a liberal-only thing you bloody numpty, 
  my club went from 1 member to 5 yesterday . 
  we have an annual growth rate of 182,500 % !, 
  oh , good . 
  out of all metaphorical hills one can die on , you choose to defend nazis . 
  rethink your life , my dude . 
  clearly just a descendent of hades, 
  i 'd argue that korean is easier than it looks ( since it 's a phonetic alphabet ) , but not chinese . 
  even simpler things than that !, 
  we had a smart uniform at our school ( blazer and tie , the works ) and you could tell who was rich and who was poor by who was wearing the new , bespoke uniform versus who worn the cheap , hand-me-down uniform . 
  plus the cool kids ( read , the bullies ) ended up distinguishing themselves by the way they wore their ties , so the formation of cliques was not stopped in the slightest . 
   it helps put everyone on a level playing field , cliques/groups can not be formed by dying your hair , carrying lv bags etc ; socio-economic distinctions are less visible , the poor and rich dress alike . 
  ergo less peer pressure/bullying . 
  less able to form gangs/groups . 
  in theory . 
  in practice this does n't work in the slightest . 
  wtc7 collapsed after it caught fire because it was left to burn down . 
  firefighters that had started to combat it were pulled away to deal with the planes hitting the towers . 
  * all * emergency services were redirected to the towers that day . 
  several separate buildings across new york also burnt down , purely because there were no firefighters available . 
  in this case , firefighters were there immediately and could stay to combat the flames . 
  that is why it did not collapse . 
  there is n't much else , i 'm afraid . 
  despite something like 80 % of media in the uk being owned by a half-dozen right-wing billionaires , the quality of most of it is utter garbage . 
  absolutely not . 
  spectator is much better for a right-wing view . 
  seriously question for the religious in here . 
  where would true ai fit in your religion , were it to exist ? 
  would robots be allowed to be members of your faith , or would they be considered intrinsically soulless ? 
  i 'm not sure those qualify as a ` who ' . 
  they barely qualify as a ` what ' . 
  ( / s , obviously ) ** edit ** : are jokes about vegetarians not allowed , now ? 
  bit confused . 
  this sounds more like an issue with how our ridiculous fptp voting system works . 
  the good soldier \u0160vejk , i guess ? 
  read it for the first time a little while ago . 
  sad it was never finished , but at the same time the idea of such a comedic farce abruptly ending seems perfect in its own way . 
  `` so much for the tolerant left ! '', 
  i 'm afraid you misunderstand me . 
  so put your bloody ellipses away . 
  when did we abandon our liberal values to fight communism ? 
  for that matter , how did we give them up to fight fascism ? 
   and even communism when was this , sorry ? 
  you 'd think we 'd learn . 
  when someone shows you who they really are , believe them . 
  god , i am legit terrified that le pen will win . 
  after the shit show that was 2016 an actual fascist being the president of france would just be the rancid icing on the cake, 
  of course . 
  i like the theory that his view of mordor was also influenced by his experiences in the first world war, 
  i fail to see how giving palestine legitimacy as a nation hurts the peace process . 
  it means that palestine is now actually accountable for the things it does to israel , and israel is accountable for the thing it does to palestine . 
  how is this bad , exactly ? 
  but you 've got the numbers , the money and the industry . 
  and if russia did decide to attack , suddenly you 'd have those pacifists 100 % behind you . 
  so it 's blackmail , then ? 
  do as russia says or they pull the plug . 
  fuck that . 
  i call their bluff . 
  they would n't dare do it , because to do so would be to economically doom themselves . 
  i 'm poor , and live in a draughty house built in the 60s . 
  you just described my average winters . 
  no , seriously . 
  on bad nights my breathe condenses . 
   russia threatens eu with ` retaliation ' pfff , bring it on . 
  we 've got full-strength france at our side , and germany is whole once again , and this time the poles / czechs / etc are free . 
  you would n't stand much of a chance . 
  this is n't 1955 . 
  you 're no longer in a position to bully others into getting what you want . 
  alright , got me there . 
  but regardless , argentina has n't a leg to stand on . 
  so it was uninhabited , then the french colonised it , then they left and we took them . 
  and ? 
  a colony is not an inherently bad thing . 
  no people were inhabiting the islands ( both in this analogy and in the case of the falklands ) thus the islands did not belong to anyone . 
  claiming ' * well our county , that was founded after you colonised that , is closer to that than you , so it 's ours * ' is just ludicrous . 
  besides , the falklands are a british overseas territory . 
  while the queen is their head of state , and we have a duty to protect them and such , they 're pretty much entirely self-governing . 
  the only reason they have n't gone independent is because they 've never chosen to , seeing their current situation as more convenient .
