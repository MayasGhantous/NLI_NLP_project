  ca n't imagine why . 
  i wonder if it 's anything to do with the belligerent state next to it , that seems intent on invading them . 
  the islands were uninhabited . 
  while natives from chile used to canoe there thousands of years ago ( apparently for religious reasons ) nobody - i repeat , ** nobody ** - was living there when the british colonised it . 
  thus the point you 're trying to make is invalid . 
  if china had colonised an uninhabited island next to finland , before finland even existed as a country , then it would be a valid analogy . 
  come on eu !, 
  you know you have a pr problem in britain , well this is your big chance !, 
  supporting the uk here and piling the pressure on argentina literally has no downside for you !, 
  you show your morality by supporting the rights of the islanders , and you win the support of the british by sticking with them . 
  aaaand once again anyone who does n't immediately agree is downvoted into oblivion . 
  how 's that circlejerking working out ? 
  the tories are what 's going on in britain . 
  they 're wannabe republicans . 
  oh please . 
  only good thing thatcher did was kick the argies off the falklands . 
  she brought over from american reagan-style policies that led to the current economical mess . 
  it 's like a caricature of what right-wingers think left-wingers are like . 
  i 'm not sure i understand the significance of the teddy bear face . 
  i 'm conflicted . 
  on the one hand , i am very fond of the eu and do not want britain to leave it ( albeit only because it 's more beneficial for us to be inside using it to our own ends , rather than being in direct competition with it ) . 
  on the other hand , i dislike the tories from the pity of my egalitarian , working class soul , and i think the british government needs to buck its ideas up and realise that we are n't an empire any more , and no matter how distasteful we may find it we need to work together with you foreigners on this one what i think our government needs to realise is that it 's not a case of big bad europa wanting to rule us . 
  the eu - germany in particular - really wants us on their side . 
  partly to balance out the french influence . 
  france is the id , germany is the superego , and we 'd be the ego , if you see what i mean . 
  or maybe i 'm spouting utter drivel , who knows . 
  my minds eye shows me the last scene of raiders of the lost ark , but instead of their faces melting they all become horrifically obese . 
  nnnnnoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ... 
  but we ca n't leave !, 
  how can we work the system for our own gain if we 're outside it !, 
  then we 'd have to actually compete with the eu !, 
  if it 's any consolation , when i think of dutch i think william of orange , rather than marijuana . 
  i propose that a group of europeans be known as ` an argument ' . 
  all in favour ? 
  the legality of abortion does in no way affect the number of abortions . 
  i 'm happy to say we do n't get involved in that nasty sex business . 
  we reproduce via budding . 
  * shudder * meat wind chimes ... 
  a wholly german empire . 
  that 's okay , let 's go get drunk . 
  it 's quite funny how true it is . 
  in this day and age , even if you do n't like germany you ca n't dislike them . 
  they 're terminally inoffensive . 
  why plus seven ? 
  i can understand the half your age bit , as it seems a decent sort of rule to make up , but why the arbitrary seven on top of it ? 
  well fuck you too , old chap . 
  i do n't care how good of an idea it is , i am not agreeing with anything that lying , war criminal snake tony blair says . 
  i would n't piss on him if he was on fire . 
  even if we take that to be true , i hardly see how that 's relevant . 
  yes , but the difference is that we 've always * won * them . 
  apart from that one time in 1066 . 
  and no , william of orange does n't count either . 
  we invited him . 
  first off : nope . 
  especially not the portugese . 
  longest running alliance fo life yo . 
  second : come on now . 
  we 've spent the last thousand years rebuffing invasions from europe . 
  we 're allowed to be a little suspicious . 
  yes , that is a problem . 
  we need to find a proper disposal method . 
  however , our current storage methods are effective at containing it for now . 
  that 's beside the point though . 
  i 'm talking about things like pollution and health lowered / lives shortened or lost . 
  coal beats nuclear by leagues . 
  good for them . 
  nothing wrong with nuclear power . 
  for it to be as amicable to human life as coal has been , there would need to be a chernobyl style disaster every day for years . 
  dos fish and chips sil vous plait ? 
  same here . 
  i do n't ** hate ** all you buggers . 
  not really . 
  i may not have a desire to switch to monopoly money , but if ( say ) aliens / russians / alien russians invaded and you asked for help , i 'd come running . 
  i suppose it would . 
  however , we should dress like the allied nations from red alert . 
  ** and there was much rejoicing **, 
  yes they do . 
  they make their way through europe to calais , and then sneak aboard the ships there . 
  the french authorities do n't do anything about them , since they know they 're heading for britain and thus in their eyes ` are n't their problem ', 
  shaddap crazy whiterun guy !, 
  oh please . 
  we 're not leaving . 
  it 's far too beneficial for us to remain inside . 
  ~ ~ like a maggot consuming an apple from within ~ ~ because we 're all friends here , are n't we chaps ? 
  i know nothing about them , so i ca n't give an informed opinion . 
  if i could get a link to some basic information about them , i will be happy to give one . 
  well if the math checks out , then yikes !, 
  take it from someone who has * no * interest in football whatsoever : if you 're actually there ( or even if you 're just roped into watching it on tv ) you can very easily get caught up in it . 
   at some point you have to choose , you either commit to the eu or go your own way no other country is given this ridiculous ultimatum of ` either go 100 % eu or leave ' so why should we ? 
  no , i just do n't know / have n't seen enough of milliband to have an informed opinion . 
  it 's not much of an exaggeration that the only people with worse pr than the eu in britain is the nazi party . 
  seriously , people do n't hear about any good it does . 
  we only hear about the rules passed down , or our gutter press talking about how the french are screwing us over , or whatever . 
   because they 're still much better than labour . 
  blair / brown labour ? 
  sure . 
  i 'm not so certain about the new labour leadership though . 
  you 're bang on the money about the first past the post system though . 
  i 'd totally vote for green ( since i agree with them the most ) but because of gerrymandering , i 'd be throwing my vote away if i did n't select either labour or tory . 
  we need to change the voting system .
