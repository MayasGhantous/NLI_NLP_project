  not to av , to full proportional representation . 
   it 's as if they do n't think they 're part of europe , that the rest of us are out to get them . 
  well , for the majority of the time ( history wise ) you have all been out to get us . 
  well not portugal ( since we have the longest lasting alliance in the world , bros fo life yo ) but certainly france , and germany a little ( although they 're mostly johnny-come-latelies in the grand scheme of things ), 
  i disagree . 
  even if the eu can be dumb as a rock sometimes , at least their heart is in the right place . 
  the tories , on the other hand , seem to want to turn britain into a little america . 
  a little republican american , at that . 
  they do n't give a shit beyond raking in money for themselves and their friends in big business . 
  the thing about free speech , right , is that it also protects people who say things you do n't like . 
  calm down old chap, 
  he 'll be the first man to break the sound barrier without a plane . 
  he 's going up high enough , so when he falls he 'll create a sonic boom . 
  the guy who jumped a few thousand metres lower did n't break the sound barrier . 
  this guy will . 
  just by falling , he will be the first human to break the sound barrier without being in a plane . 
  there are no practical applications for knowing what happens when a guy jumps from the edge of space ? 
  i hope to god he actually manages it . 
  not only will it be the most awesome thing ever to be done in the history of mankind , but think of the practical applications such success will bring !, 
  problem on a space station ? 
  not enough time to send a rocket ? 
  no worries !, 
  just point yourself planet-ward and jump !, 
  i did n't say it was n't their right . 
  i said it was impolite . 
  well , that 's not very polite , is it . 
  oh go on al-qaeda , * please * threaten france !, 
  there are graveyards full of men who threatened france !, 
   there 's absolutely no need to stop heterosexual couples declaring themselves ` mother ' and ` father ' ** nobody is fucking saying that !, 
  nobody is saying that mothers and fathers can no longer refer to themselves as mothers or fathers !, 
  ** jesus christ on a bicycle built for two !, 
  it will just say ` parents ' on the paperwork !, 
  that 's literally ** it ** !, 
  so what , you want two separate pieces of paper ? 
  that 's twice the work and cost , right there . 
  it says a lot about cameron 's administration and current running of affairs , that i 'm actively hoping the eu gets more power over him . 
  i may disagree with europe on many things , but at least they do n't want us to be a mini-usa , heartless soicety . 
  i think ` bloody rich people ' sums up my feelings quite nicely . 
  honest , if tactless . 
  i think you 're reading too much into my comment . 
  it was n't a jab at americans , it was a jab at bureaucrats . 
  the fact that they happen to be american in this instance is inconsequential . 
  ** i fucking know , right ?!, 
  ** what the heck !, 
  i actually said out loud ` oooh , fucking hell ' . 
  wow . 
  i mean , just . 
  wow . 
  maybe it 's not the case in germany , but everywhere else people are nothing if not full of nonsense . 
  i believe they use the term ` rosbif ' . 
  although i feel obligated to mention ( just in case ) that the french / english hatred has been nothing more than friendly rivalry for over a hundred years . 
  ~ ~ they realised we were better ~ ~, 
  we had all our bases covered with the harrier jets !, 
  ` frenchman ', 
  pity the eurofighter is useless in this day and age . 
  it was designed to fight soviet migs . 
  for a knife fight in a phone box . 
  instead , we 're using them to bombard middle-eastern countries with no aircraft of their own . 
  i think this thing comes in waves . 
  it used to be all about sub-continentals . 
  then they integrated , started being born here , and stuff like curry was introduced and became a national dish . 
  so people stopped caring . 
  then it was black caribbean 's . 
  now it 's polish . 
  no doubt another group will become the subject of scorn when people stop caring about the polish . 
  there 's probably some . 
  however class is a much bigger thing here . 
  odds are , old people wo n't care if their children marry those of a different colour . 
  they just care if they went to university or not . 
  once again , the czechs get it . 
  perhaps a european government would have realised that you do not invade afghanistan . 
  the americans , with a current military budget larger than the next five countries combined , could not hold afghanistan . 
  the soviets , at the height of their power , could not hold afghanistan . 
  ** alexander the bloody great ** could not hold afghanistan . 
  it is something that is just ** not done ** . 
  goddammit europe , i thought you were safe !, 
  i 'm never leaving this island again !, 
  i bet they 're fuhrerious, 
  is the answer ` the clash ' ? 
   europeans arent carrying guns and killing each other for stupid shit for one . 
  have you opened a history book ? 
  that 's , like , all we do . 
  bitch , i 'm on an it course learning how to programme . 
  i ** am ** a wizard !, 
  ( * or at least , that 's what it feels like . 
  god i 'm pathetic * ), 
  for you iticu , ze browzing iz over !, 
  the whole idea of ` jocks picked on everyone , especially the nerds ' was n't a thing . 
  the jocks were lovely people . 
  a bit too ` laddish ' for my tastes , but we got on fine . 
  by order of the prophet we ban that boogie sound, 
  `` damn it , uk wants to leave '' `` should we try and convince them not to ? 
  show them the benefits of staying ? '', 
  `` no , let 's just make it impossible for them to leave '' `` brilliant !, 
  this can not backfire in any way ! '', 
  sometimes it feels like dara o'briain is on the telly too bloody much , if that 's what you 're asking, 
  it 's funny , is n't it . 
  wow , seriously ? 
  we 're doing this right now ? 
   spanish  points to mexico que ?
