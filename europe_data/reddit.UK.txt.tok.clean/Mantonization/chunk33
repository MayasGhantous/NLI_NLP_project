  i know they speak a form of spanish there , but ... really now ? 
  this is the thing . 
  it 's israel being cocks and acting like they can tell germany what to do . 
  i believe the correct response from the germans should be ` verpiss dich ' ? 
  on the one hand : thank you for correcting me . 
  on the other hand : how does that change things in the slightest ? 
  `` oh fuck off '' i literally said that out loud to myself . 
  this is n't about being jewish , and ** s ** he bloody well knows it . 
  i did n't think it was possible either . 
  that 's the tories for you . 
  got in because people were disgusted with blair / brown 's new labour , and then they decided to be everything blair / brown were , but worse . 
  that was ... beautiful . 
  i mean , i 'm a complete chump for this sort of thing so take what i say with a pinch of cynicism , but that was absolutely beautiful . 
  seriously , wow . 
  makes me wish i could afford to go . 
  i 'm sort of surprised that the la times is reporting this . 
  i mean ( and i understand this is probably prejudiced of me ) i 've sort of come to expect american media to never report on europe , unless it directly affects them . 
  be careful what you wish for . 
  please . 
  i 'm hardly eu positive , just pragmatic . 
  i like the eu project , simply because it offers peace and prosperity for britain in the long term . 
  you all benefiting from it as well is a pleasant side-benefit . 
  we ca n't isolate ourselves , because then we 'd be in competition with an economic / military juggernaut just off-shore . 
  we ca n't exactly get another empire in this day and age , and there 's no way in hell we 'd benefit from getting closer to the obese , idiotic barbarian that is america . 
  ( no offence to any americans . 
  individually , you 're great people . 
  your establishment is monstrous , however ), 
  you know , part of me thinks that the nazis totally could have made flying saucers . 
  every new politician faces a loss of approval in their first autumn , as the hype surrounding their election dies off and people realise they wo n't magically fix everything . 
  note : i 'm not condoning or condemning the man 's policies, 
  bloody hell . 
  the germans really built some crazy things , did n't they . 
  i think germany should be on the security council with us and france . 
  apart from that , i do n't really have much to say . 
  they do n't really get much done , but that 's how they 're structured . 
  it 's not their fault we 're all cocks . 
  edit : ** alternatively !, 
  ** britain and france both step down from the security council , to be replaced by an eu representative . 
  our needs are addressed , but there 's less chance of france and us ( read : us ) exploiting it for our own political gain . 
  pretty much this . 
  we brits have done this sort of thing before . 
  we know it to be bad , and we know how it ends . 
  we should just start releasing lions into the wild . 
  it 'll cure the obesity epidemic in no time . 
  of course , there 's the risk of some chavs taming them ... 
  ugh uht milk is awful . 
  it tastes terrible . 
  well then !, 
  even on top of a fucking mountain there 's nowhere to go in britain !, 
  there 's nowhere for ignorant people to really hide away from reality . 
  i would n't say so for britain . 
  the fact that you 're never 15 minutes away from another person unless you 're on ben nevis probably helps somewhat . 
  america 's got a lot of space between population centres that we do n't, 
  `` do not use those shiny new weapons in that cupboard over there . 
  no , not that one . 
  the other one '', 
  if i had to choose between my country or europe , i would choose my country . 
  no question . 
  but if ( hypothetically ) aliens / robots / russians / russian robots made from alien tech decided to invade europe , i would pick up a rifle and gladly put my life on the line for you foreign bastards . 
  as i understand it , we can only extradite to the us if : - the us requests it - the alleged crime is also a crime in the uk i personally do n't think we should extradite to places with worse prison systems than ours , as a matter of principle . 
  you said that a certain view is valid if a high enough percentage of people say it is . 
  so if ( let 's say ) 65 % of people believed that gravity did n't exist , that would suddenly mean their believe was valid , was it ? 
  it 's a logical fallacy . 
  i do n't know how you 're getting upvotes . 
  maybe the swedish flag is throwing people off . 
  yeah , you guys got up to some ** nasty ** shit . 
  and this is coming from a brit . 
  we 're talking ` buy out a company that was peacefully trading with some native islanders , wipe the islanders out , and turn their island into nothing but sugar plantations ' kind of evil . 
  that does n't magically render their view valid . 
  well , i guess we can use google translate when we need to . 
  although it might be fun to try read them first , and get an idea of their meaning . 
  should n't spanish be included as well , though ? 
  i mean , in school the three other languages we could learn were french , german and spanish , so i 've always had the impression that spanish is a significant language too , right ? 
  no sooner than we all go to faerieland . 
  you just need to say ` trust us ' and i 'll have a bingo, 
  in practice , no . 
  it 's pretty much always a two party system . 
  i 'm sorry professor , but i left my 52 page homework report at home . 
  or maybe my dog ate it . 
  i did n't think we were handing it in so soon !, 
  i was hoping that you would draw from this comparison the idea romney seems to be the antithesis of the ` benevolent social-safety net ' society model we follow in europe , while obama seems a bit closer to our values . 
  and from that idea , you would draw the conclusion that obama would be a better ally for us , since we would be more likely to understand each other . 
  obama wants to give more americans healthcare , and tax the rich more . 
  romney wants to take that healthcare away , and give more tax breaks to the rich . 
  what do you think ? 
  ehh , she brings in more money that she costs , and her husband is hilarious . 
  do n't fix what is n't broken , i say . 
  i do n't see what you 're getting at, 
   both of your answers contradict your attitude , otherwise . 
  i mean , you 're not an equal partner in the nhs , the lady with the heavy smoking habit and 7 obese kids down the road gains more from your pay in . 
  that 's a bit different . 
  and i am emotionally invested in the nhs . 
   and if you have no investment in europe , why not support the fully euroskeptic party that puts brits first ... 
  i was talking more about the eurosceptical people in britain than myself personally . 
  i myself see the value in europe and see that we have to work with it , or else end up right next to a superpower we 've no control over . 
  but at the end of the day , i want my country to be a partner in europe , not a slave to europe . 
   yes , but if you do n't play ball with us , why would we play ball with you ? 
  we say that to you . 
  so you say it to us . 
  so we say it to you .
