  and so on ad infinitum . 
  if we do n't care about something , we 're not going to give an arm and a leg for it . 
  instead of just forcing us to give you those , why do n't you try making us give a damn ? 
   what do you think of the nhs ? 
  wonderful system , would n't do without it . 
   did you vote ukip ? 
  how dare you !, 
  we ' v nothing against working with europe , but that 's the key word here . 
  ** with ** , not ** for ** . 
  an irishman , of all people , should be able to see the difference between the two . 
  we 've spent nearly a thousand years beating away europe 's attempts to make us work for them , and we 're not willing to let them start now . 
  we are , however , willing to work with them as equals . 
  if someone is not emotionally invested or something , or does not consider themselves to be an equal partner in something , you can not reasonably expect them to let themselves suffer for ` the greater good ' of that something . 
  key word being ` asset ' . 
  we 're not seen as a potential partner , but as a thing to be claimed for the glory of brussels . 
  maybe the eu would be more accepted over here , if it did n't have such abysmal pr . 
  i mean really . 
   doing everything to avoid having to do anything/pay anything for the greater good of europe , if it effects them negatively . 
  you 've illustrated this beautifully . 
  britain thinks and is thought of as separate from europe . 
  we 're not emotionally invested in the project , being unwillingly dragged into it at best . 
  bearing that in mind , of course we wo n't do something that affects us negatively for ` the greater good ' of europe . 
  no sane person would . 
  side note : ` the greater good ' is such a weasel term . 
  crusty jugglers . 
  we 're on the list !,

  dos fish and chips sil vous plait ? 
  talk about a queen of straw !, 
  personally , i do n't see why they should n't have nuclear weaponry . 
  iran only wants them because then it could stand up to the us / israel . 
  not that i agree with a lot of iran 's policies , quite the opposite . 
  but if it 's a choice between ` having nukes ' or ` constantly under threat from the us and its middle-eastern ally ' i 'd go with the former . 
  vaclav havel . 
  or i would , if he had n't sadly passed on . 
  there was a man who ** got ** it . 
  yes , well , we 're stuck with you lot , so we might as well try and keep it going . 
  i-it 's not like we like you , or anything !, 
  we have to talk loudly , otherwise the foreigners ca n't understand us !, 
  * * my gran actually believes this . 
  she also mimes . 
  haha !, 
  take that you damned scot !, 
  england wins again !, 
  there are n't any unicorns either , last time i checked . 
  oh no you fucking do n't !, 
  if we do n't get to pull out because the majority of us do n't like it , then neither can you !, 
  and boris johnson and camilla were in the background of the shot , pointing to him and laughing . 
  i know , right ? 
  also , britain was still using rationing in 1948 , so a lot of our athletes kept collapsing during training . 
  every country that came to those olympics brought tonnes and tonnes of food with them , as a gift . 
  france brought a ** train full ** of wine , but it was detained at customs because they did n't believe it was for personal use . 
  we mostly make expensive , technical bits . 
  computer parts , helicopters , etc etc. 
  we 're the 7th biggest manufacturer in the world . 
  we used to be 6th until last year , when brazil ( with over three times the size and population ) finally overtook us . 
  we still make plenty . 
  are you expecting me to personally make you a huge-ass list of his standings and hypocrisies ? 
  on a separate note , i find it amusing that you 're saying my comment is of little merit , when your response to people saying they dislike mitt romney is to accuse them of racism . 
  because that 's the only possible reason they could hate him , right ? 
  not because he 's a walking avatar of the corporate-owned , fuck-you-i-got-mine extremism ( both religious and capitalist ) that is the republican party . 
  nope , it 's because he 's white !, 
  that 's why europeans dislike him !, 
  makes sense to me !, 
  an excellent point , sir !, 
  might i offer a rebuttal ? 
  go fuck yourself with a cactus . 
  i do n't hate him because he 's white . 
  i hate him because he 's - to put it politely - a fucking scumbag , so greasy that if you tried to hang him he 'd slide out of the noose . 
  he 's a living representation of everything that is wrong with american politics nowadays . 
   europeans ... have finally come to realize that they can no longer outsource their security or their prosperity to uncle sam . 
  it 's bloody outrageous . 
  the nerve of them !, 
  it 's as if they think ** we 're ** paying ** them ** to be here !, 
  god , no , please . 
  we do n't want him over here . 
  wow !, 
  here i was , thinking that i was against religious circumcision because it was a barbaric practice carried out on babies without anaesthetic , with high risk of infection , and permanently robs that person of sensation without their consent !, 
  but it turns out , i just actually hate jews !, 
  thank you , yearofthemoose , for showing me the light !, 
  some are , but not all . 
  regardless , i think that ex-militants would be a powerful force against radical islam . 
  they rob jihad of the glamour and glory it promises . 
  part of me thinks this might be a good thing . 
  i mean , what better to dissuade would-be militants , than a bunch of people who tried that and realised how stupid the whole thing is ? 
  do n't you start, 
  you 're somehow under the impression that feuding and fighting is n't what good neighbours do . 
  aah , but you see , they 'll all be too busy stopping ` those no-good foreigner politicians ' taking stuff to actually take anything themselves . 
  it 's like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sf5a7.jpg ), 
  it 's funny , because to most people on this subreddit i 'm the close-minded nationalistic arse . 
  to answer your question : yes , we should be inside . 
  we benefit from it , immensely so . 
  and besides , we ca n't let a huge political union sit right on our doorstep . 
  we should either be part of it or fight against it . 
  and we 've no desire to fight another european war . 
  that may sound disgustingly realpolitik , but you know . 
  there 's probably a relevant yes prime minister clip . 
  stay strong , bulgaria . 
  do n't let the bastards scare you . 
  if you can get it to work without losing representation , then sure , why the fuck not .
