  let 's all bandy up and create something great . 
  if not , well , we can stay neighbours . 
  in a word ? 
  in two words ? 
  god no . 
  in three words ? 
  oh god , no . 
  in four words ? 
  oh god , no , god . 
  [ in five wor - ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=detm_q2lk9g ), 
  god , my gran is like that . 
  she is ** literally ** the worst . 
  racist as anything . 
  we went to france once , and when we went to a restaurant she tried to order the chicken in english . 
  when that did n't work , she said ` chic-ken ' loud and slow , and ** then mimed a chicken flapping its wings and made clucking sounds **, 
  do n't tell me you actually find it funny . 
  do not feed the trolls, 
  [ hats ? 
  i love hats !, 
  ] ( http://files.redux.com/images/df4e0c885de04b76bbb505662d035e9e/raw ), 
  why does every single pope look like emperor palpatine ? 
  is that part of the inauguration process ? 
  once you put on the pointy-hat you age into that form ? 
  i 'm sorry that you feel that way . 
  hopefully that will change in the future . 
  you can ignore points of view that do n't match yours , but that does n't make them go away . 
   enjoy your island solitude . 
  see , here 's the thing , that 's what a ` fanatic nationalist arse ' * wants * you to say . 
  they do n't feel the european brotherhood that you say exists , and they want to be left alone . 
  you 're not helping . 
  i 'd personally quite like it for the majority of us to feel that brotherhood , but accusing those who currently do n't of just pining for the days of empire does * not * help . 
  you 're chasing them away from your cause with hostility . 
  the humble crow . 
  corvids have historically been associated with both wisdom ( something we aspire to hold ) and death ( a constant reminder of the wars we should never forget ) , two things europe has been rife with since forever . 
  they are also [ extraordinarily smart ] ( http://www.cracked.com/article_19042_6-terrifying-ways-crows-are-way-smarter-than-you-think.html ) , and getting smarter . 
  but crows especially , since they are social animals and teach their young everything they learn . 
  you teach a crow to be better , and soon all crows learn to be better . 
  therefore , i put it to you that the crow is the bird of europe . 
  shall we just all post military ads from our respective countries ? 
  would make for an interesting subject . 
  as compared to the ` ooh rah , fight the dragon ' ads of our trans-atlantic cousins , the adverts for our royal marines could be best summed up as ` piss off , we do n't want weaklings like you ' . 
  [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iucam_0ztbm] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iucam_0ztbm ), 
  it does seem a bit of an overly-dramatic title . 
  i am , quite frankly , appalled and disgusted !, 
  why are we arguing with germany so much ? 
  we should be focusing on the ** real ** threat !, 
  insistently telling another that they 're the same as you is not going to endear them to you . 
  quite the opposite , in fact . 
  you can all shout and scream all you want about how we 're ` european ' too and working with you wo n't just be us accepting subservience , but words alone wo n't convince us otherwise , no matter how oft they 're repeated . 
  that 's the long and short of it . 
  throw in something about france , and 10/10 would rage again, 
  would you prefer britain to be a mindless yes man for brussels ? 
  would you rather an echo chamber ? 
   britain has to face up to the loss of empire and accept europe wow , talk about an inherently hostile and accusatory phrase !, 
  that 's totally gotten me on side !, 
  it 's not at all made me mentally correct that sentence as ` stop wanting autonomy and just take that french cock up the ass ' !, 
  no sir !, 
   seen as subjugation to another `` empire '' . 
  it seems that many brits do n't consider themselves `` european '' , and thus they see the eu as a foreign power rather than a collective effort . 
  gee , i wonder why that is . 
   if the workers get paid too low , then venders will lower their prices , otherwise it cuts into to profits ( and lowering the prices does not cut too much into profits b/c cheap labor means cheaper goods , meaning their money is worth more ) . 
  if that were the case , ipads would n't cost hundreds of pounds . 
  refusing local labour for foreign labour who will take lower pay and worse conditions helps nobodies but the corporations . 
  you end up with rich companies , and a poor , unemployed local populace . 
  tensions will undoubtedly rise between them and the brought in illegals who are ` taking their jobs ' . 
   the upside is that local businesses get access to cheap labor instead of people willing to go off employment benefits . 
  you 're being sarcastic , yes ? 
  i do n't think you understand . 
  i 've nothing against immigrants . 
  it 's illegal immigrants i have a problem with . 
  especially the ones that ( oh , i do n't know ) camp around calais with the intent to sneak into the uk , while the french police just stand by and watch . 
   i voted for hollande in the hope that he would once again make france a country that take care of immigrants instead of throwing people back out just because the racist fringes of our country ca n't handle different cultures . 
  i hope you 're not implying that anyone who 's against illegal immigration is a racist ? 
  i do n't know !, 
  this is what frustrates me the most . 
  i ** know ** most of these people just want a better life , and i ** know ** that most would try and get in legally if they could . 
  but the fact is that we ca n't take them all , and we simply ca n't help them all . 
  that does n't mean we should put up with it though !, 
  why should we just bend over and take that sort of thing ? 
  ca n't they just , you know , deport them ? 
  they 're illegal immigrants . 
  i know right ? 
  we 've done nothing to or in europe at all this past couple of thousand years . 
  ours is over in about three to four weeks . 
  you 're reading too much into it . 
  consider that the monarchy is a living metaphor for british values . 
  it reads a lot better then . 
  man , sometimes i love the universe . 
  aah , my mistake . 
  indeed . 
  i do n't know how you manage to live without it, 
  i think it 's an mp5, 
   james bond plastered over an eu flag i feel culturally violated . 
  i also demand that big ben be at least an inch higher up than the eiffel tower, 
  oh please , you 're just being para, 
  only one british guy ? 
  makes my job easier . 
  now , where did i put that crossbow ... 
  yeah , let 's not do ... that . 
  what a strange 4th of july this has been .
