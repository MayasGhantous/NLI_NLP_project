  it 's kind of embarrassing to watch , but also kind of heart-warming . 
  it 's fun to watch americans discover europe . 
  i guess i agree with this , as well as this bit that mr_lantin said :  how do people react around you if you 're faced with a naive stranger ? 
  are you seen as a moron for not taking advantage of the situation ? 
  or would you be shunned if you tried to get the better of him ? 
  i may or may not trust the individuals ( i believe in the inherent goodness of man , which helps ) but i do n't trust the framework and institutions in place for those places . 
  we should n't have a ` european dream ' . 
  we should be awake instead . 
  of course ethnic minorities are going to say that ` britishness ' is very important to them , since they have to work harder to be thought of as british and not as an ` other ' . 
  native whites by contrast , do n't have to worry so much about that . 
  did n't they already try tha - [ ** bzzzzzzzzzzz ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3yyzr6el3m ) but yes , i agree . 
  i 'm cringing already . 
  good for hollande , says i. 
  instead of just shooting down acta every time it rears its head and calling it a day , we need to pass laws making internet freedoms inalienable rights . 
  the powers behind things like acta , they 're like a hydra . 
  for every sopa or pipa you shoot down , two more take its place . 
  and they have to just get lucky once and get one through , while the people have to be lucky every time and defeat every one . 
  i , for one , am furious . 
  i think we need to ... ** remind him ** of the democratic process . 
  any frenchies have any ideas ? 
  what , like the us ? 
  a system where employees have no power , and the employers can fire you simply because they do n't like the look of your face / feel you 're working so hard they fear looking bad ? 
  yeah . 
  at the end of the day , the eu 's just too useful a thing . 
  and we 're not stupid . 
  we may be many things , but we are not stupid . 
  we know that eventually , we 'll have to stiffen our lips and buddy up with the mainland out for political safety . 
  we 'll call shotgun . 
  france has to sit in the back seat with poland . 
  who ** does n't ** flock to bookstores ? 
  i 've nothing against e-readers . 
  they 're amazing pieces of technology . 
  but nothing will truly replace a book . 
  the sound , the smell , the feel of a book , of being surrounded by them . 
  it 's the same reason plays will never die , even though we now have television , films and the internet . 
  i agree , something really should be done . 
  i 'd even consider agreeing a proper political eu if it meant telling america to piss off . 
  totally . 
  shall we just cut to the chase and start re-building the berlin wall ? 
   ten eu foreign ministers want to transform the eu into a federal state yeah ? 
   modelled after the us nooooooooooooo !, 
  we want something that works !, 
  america does n't even try teach its model to countries it 's ` brought democracy to ', 
  plus it 's still a relevant piece of history yes , it was . 
  it was the last conventional , total war between world powers of roughly equal strength , and - due to the advent of nuclear weapons - it may possibly be the last . 
  while these stories are very funny , i feel the need to ask if anyone else is uneasy with this level of basic ignorance ? 
  i mean , we 're talking about voting citizens of ( currently ) the most powerful military nation on earth , with the most nuclear weapons . 
  very nice . 
  i 'll be expecting a bunch of ` this man is your friend !, 
  he fights for freedom ! ', 
  ones next . 
  with horrible stereotypes . 
  48 % to 100 % agree !, 
  it 's good enough !, 
  for a second there , i thought that one hugging the telly was going to pull it off the wall !, 
  hooray !, 
  my opinion is validated by the majority !, 
  so , what do you think the future 's going to look like once oil pretty much dries up ? 
  how is rape defined in sweden ? 
  does it just cover penetration , or does it also cover envelopment ? 
  that fruit-wielding bastard, 
  i thought this was going be a joke article about lemon ~ ~ k ~ ~ curd . 
  now i 'm just angry . 
  that 's outrageous . 
  i honestly think i would prefer her if she were evil . 
  at least you know where you stand with evil . 
  pull the other one , it 's got bells on . 
  since when have politicians ever cared about what the people want ? 
  * que ? 
  ** edgy post bro **, 
  it is a ** very ** popular issue . 
  the falklands war was the last war we fought that was totally , 100 % morally justified . 
  we were defending people who wished to remain british against an invading fascist dictatorship . 
  ** there is no possible way this could ever go wrong **, 
   the un wo n't recognize the referendum because the population of the falklands was imported there the un recognise the islanders right to self determination . 
  also , there were ** no ** indigenous people living on the falklands . 
  ancient tribals from chile occasionally visited , but nobody lived there before it was colonised . 
  or he calls us cockroaches . 
  amusingly . 
  while they may occasionally have some good points , i am almost ** never ** willing to trust america when it comes to economics . 
  talk about the blind trying to lead the one-eyed man . 
  oh yeah , sure , just brush off all doubts brits have on the subject with a ` you 're just being butthurt ' ** that 'll ** get them on side !, 
  surely !, 
   yeah , it is a sort of extortion you * admit it * , and yet you * support * it ? 
  i 'd expect a romanian of all people to stand against this sort of thing !, 
   but you are not giving power away ( unless you are personally part of the local government ) . 
  by not standing against this , we are giving our power away . 
  to remain silent is to agree . 
   they 'll do it anyway * and they wonder why eurosceptics exist *, 
  so this is how liberty dies . 
  with ~ ~ thunderous applause ~ ~ der spiegel articles . 
  jokes aside : to be honest , this is making me increasingly uneasy . 
  i do n't think this will be democratic , nor will it be beneficial to my country / represent its interests in the slightest . 
  quite the opposite , in fact . 
  the very fact that we seem to all be falling into this union rather than willingly walking into it seems to only add weight to my fears . 
  the ` importance of issues ' bit confused the heck out of me . 
  define important ? 
  and am i supporting something if i think it 's important ? 
  or am i saying that this issue should be talked about more ? 
  results : apparently i 'm squarely balanced between socio-economic left , and anti eu integration .
