  and the party closest to my views is the green party . 
  maybe i should do some research on them ... 
  bbc radio 4 is good if you love comedy . 
  also , [ planet rock ] ( http://www.planetrock.com/ ) is nice if you like classic rock . 
  classic rock that 's in english , i mean . 
  i know that feeling exactly . 
  i think a lot of the nation feeling in britain can be summed up as '' * we used to be better at this * '' now the empire 's gone , we have n't really got a purpose or place in the world anymore . 
  we 're just ... there . 
  pissing off europe . 
  i should worry about yourselves more than us . 
  we 've learnt your viking weakness . 
  [ being stabbed in the groin from under a bridge . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_stamford_bridge#battle ), 
   is it worth it going back to the time when we were n't part of eec ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with being in a common market , however , the british people were misled to believe that they were just signing up for the common market , not a political union that would mean them being ruled by unelected pseudo-french bureaucrats . 
   there was a reason for why we joined for joining the common market , yes . 
  but :  and there is a reason why we should still stay , ** even if it 's eu rather than eec now ** . 
  why do you make this leap from common market to political union ? 
  where 's the logic in that ? 
  that 's like deciding to switch from buying and selling things with your neighbours to knocking down your own house and living in a huge one with them . 
  i 'm fine with my national neighbours , but i want them to remain ** neighbours ** . 
  not room-mates . 
  i think i misread the original comment . 
  i was under the impression it was talking about an expanded , federal u.s.e , or perhaps just the ez . 
  that aside for a second though : so what you 're saying is , we 're literally stuck with the eu because if we leave it we 're fucked ? 
   because i ca n't see ukraine , turkey or switzerland , norway * or the uk * joining the eu any time soon . 
  fixed, 
   what , would you rather be at war ? 
  not being in a union = / = being at war . 
  i refuse that dichotomy . 
   which culture on the european continent offends you so gravely that you can not possibly accept the idea of trading goods or culture with them , but instead feel compelled to start wars with them ? 
  none of them offend me , i just do n't want to be ( economically or otherwise ) forced into a union with them . 
  and also , * piss off * with your assertion that because i do n't want a union , i must be in favour of war . 
  that is intellectually dishonest of you . 
   i think the idea is just to give people the opportunity of being together , and let them work things out themselves that 's not what 's happening though . 
  people are n't being given the opportunity of working together ( and with it , the inherent opportunity to leave ) but are being economically forced into this situation . 
  forced at the end of a bank notice , rather than a gun , but forced all the same . 
   you do n't have to ` like ' the people you work with sure , but that 's not what we 're arguing . 
  quit moving the goalposts . 
   forced to instill a generic european identity this is the thing . 
  i see a lot of pro-eu people acting like you can just force an identity on people , that you can force them to be friends . 
  and if they just force everyone to work together , everything will somehow turn out all right and that false acceptance will turn into honest liking . 
  it does n't work like that . 
  they 're thinking ' * this is what people should be , how do we change them ? 
  * ' when they should be thinking ' * this is how people are , how do we deal with it ? 
  doubtless you all already know my opinion on the matter . 
  no , i would not . 
  something about cockroaches , i think ? 
   the uk just keeps threatening to veto everything [ citation needed ]  if the uk is the only one who disagrees except it most certainly ( and obviously ) is n't . 
   either support the eu through the good and bad times ahead of us or be done with it can i be brutally frank for a moment ? 
  no disrespect why should we be forced into an ` all or nothing ' type situation ? 
  i do n't see anyone else in that situation , nor do i see anyone else suggesting any other country be put in one . 
  especially since you have countries like norway and switzerland , who are just as ( if not more ) disconnected with the eu as us . 
  tell that to everyone else , or make like a tree and fuck off . 
  you think i 'd be insulted by the idea of you copulating with a replica of amy winehouse ? 
  if anything , i feel sorry for you . 
  still , rather you than me . 
  really , i trust germany with this sort of thing more than any other country . 
  well , maybe poland and czech republic more . 
  ** it begins ** edit : the reaction from this comment is very interesting . 
  i wonder if people would have read less of a negative meaning in this generic statement if i did n't have a uk flag next to my name ? 
  or perhaps if i had an eu flag , would people have thought the comment more positive ? 
  why is britain scottish ? 
  surely it should be a redcoat ? 
  i-it was a moment of weakness !, 
  i swear !, 
  i blame the americanisation of our language . 
  ignoring the fact that joking intent really does n't make such comments okay , you are trying to convey sarcasm through a text only medium . 
  that and poe 's law means that you really have to expressively point out your sarcasm . 
  i can understand sarcasm , but i 'm not bloody psychic , dig ? 
  haha , i get it !, 
  because whites are always evil !, 
  but seriously now , that 's racially prejudiced . 
  you asshole . 
  the whole thing pretty much is symbolic . 
  or perhaps historic is the right word . 
  these days ` the commonwealth ' just means ` every country created / conquered by britain that peacefully left the empire ', 
  it probably would n't happen , simply because of sheer distance . 
  the thing about the nordic council is all the countries are right next to each other . 
  let 's cut to the chase : everyone knows what they want to add to that picture , but nobody wants to be the first to say it because it 's a bit of a taboo subject around here . 
  ** why do rating agencies matter ? 
  ** i thought they were just institutions that made money off of ` speculating ' collapses and panic buying and selling of debt ? 
   ` if shown that a federal europe can provide better living conditions for everyone in it , do you still oppose it ? ' . 
  well , then it would come down to idealistic differences , rather than practical concerns . 
  i mean , yeah if it were guaranteed to work it would be extremely tempting , but i do n't like the idea of my country being run by unelected pseudo-french beurecrats who probably could n't even find the uk on a map ... of the uk . 
  it 's that whole ` personal freedom ' or ` long-term stability ' thing , is n't it . 
  edit : also ,  implying that such a question would n't be draped in propoganda and bias in other countries, 
   pretty much because it does n't really matter what flag we 're using . 
  it does from a practical standpoint on here , as the views someone holds and even how they think can differ wildly depending on their country of origin . 
  thus having such flags next to names helps others take those factors into account during discussion . 
  it 's just a game , how anal can you be ? 
   my questions to you are ; when do you think eu will become so integrated that we wo n't have national representations ? 
  to do that , you 've have to imperialisticly wipe out all individual national characteristics and replace them with a homogenised ` eu ' identity . 
  so yeah , good luck with that . 
  we 've found the cure !, 
  we must introduce it to the water supply at once !, 
  but it would have been . 
  banking is a bigger part of our economy than other countries in europe . 
  by taxing us at the same rate as everyone else , you 're disproportionately affecting us compared to everyone else . 
   i just do n't get it , if your sentiments are shared by the rest of the british people , why do n't you just leave ?
