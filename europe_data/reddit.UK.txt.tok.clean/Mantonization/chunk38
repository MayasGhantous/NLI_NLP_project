  on one hand , it would require a referendum and our current government would rather decapitate themselves with rusty razor-wire before they let that happen . 
  and on the other , we 're fine working with you . 
  we 're not fine with being ruled or subsumed by you . 
   also , how exactly are you being treated as cash cows ? 
  well , let 's go back to that ftt as an example . 
  it would have disproportionately taxed britain compared to the rest of europe . 
  shamefully so . 
  and yet it seems that you all seemed to expect us to just bend over and take it , since you all got so outraged when we refused . 
   that was certainly the general tone i got when your prime minister walked out on the last talks . 
  you mean the one over the financial transaction tax ? 
  you mean the one where it was later revealed that cameron was willing to sign , and just wanted a little compromise so that britain was n't ( due to the size of its banking sector ) unfairly taxed compared to the rest of europe ? 
  but then the petit caporal sarkozy tried to play hardball and said ` non , accept all of it unconditionally or leave ? 
  the one where , after the above things were revealed , the brit-bashers on this forum mysteriously shut up and stopped talking about it ? 
  ** those talks ? 
  ** and what you call ` over-inflated sense of importance ' we call ` not wanting to be fucked over and treated as cash-cow serfs by people we do not identify with ' . 
  side question : if we 're not important , why does europe give a damn about us / trying to get us into the ez ? 
  this is the problem , is n't it ? 
  things that are handled with villainy can turn out to be good for everyone in the long run . 
  you just ca n't tell at the time . 
  regardless of whether it 's good or not , a lot of people are n't going to be happy with it , myself included . 
   ` hahaha . . 
  the eurozone is gon na collapse '' . 
  and when was that said , exactly ? 
   just admit it bro . . deep down inside you love europe and the concept of the eu  i know deep down inside you 're pro-european  real talk for a second here : this is what i hate about you . 
  you literally can not comprehend the idea that someone has an opinion that does n't match yours . 
  that is not the mind of a rational person . 
  that is the mind of a cult member . 
  wow , it 's like you 've been genetically engineered to write obnoxious posts that make me want to punch you in the face . 
  those blasted smileys , my god . 
  also , since when did rating agencies matter ? 
  i thought the general consensus was that it 's all nonsense used to make money from panic . 
  i totally saw this coming . 
  this is some conspiracy level nonsense right here . 
  come on now , a banking crisis that is ` accidentally ' handled poorly by france and germany , causing them to bring everyone into a france / german dominated federal union just to economically survive ? 
  nope , nothing suspicious at all !, 
  no sir !, 
  / s edit : i 'd like to remind everyone that the upvote / downvote buttons are not ' i agree / i disagree ' buttons . 
  quit the circlejerking . 
  i think every country should have at least one public bank , to offer competition against private banks . 
  this publically accountable bank offers an incentive for the private ones to actually improve , since they ca n't all just unanimously agree to fuck everyone over . 
  hey , at least we brought infrastructure to the places we conquered . 
  and opium . 
  at least he admitted and apologised , right ? 
  still not that useful , but it makes him better than most other us presidents . 
   she absolutely raves about how clean , beautiful and interesting everything was i 'll hesitatingly agree with you on the interesting front , as if there 's one thing british is , it 's ` interesting ' . 
  ` eccentric ' , ` weird ' , or ` bugfuck crazy ' are also acceptable answers . 
  but ` clean and beautiful ' ? 
  really ? 
  i think it should be a crow . 
  they 're social animals that are incredibly smart ( we 're talking learning all the time , teach things and faces to their descendents and can talk ) and are very persevering . 
  usually quite docile , but very capable of holding its own if threatened . 
  it 's better than a lazy raptor that lives by stealing the fish from other birds , at least . 
  oh great , the gremlins diving into the gears again, 
  i do n't feel ` european ' at all really , so no . 
  whoosh i say again sir whoosh, 
  they 'll try bully europe into adopting it as well . 
  probably with some success , since we 're not a single entity and thus they can divide and conquer . 
  you know this to be true . 
  they 've done it before , and they will do so again . 
  ooh , link ? 
   i do n't need to post evidence , because it 's so obvious !, 
  still waiting on that proof . 
  they 've always overwhelmingly voted to remain in the union . 
  you are part of the problem . 
  instead of consistently jumping ship , why do n't you ** try and work towards fixing the problem ** ? 
  it was about spain getting gibraltar back or something , i recall . 
   no citation required . 
  ** yes citation required ** . 
  you ca n't make a claim , then just say ` oh i do n't need proof ' . 
  that 's insane . 
   articles like this just make me think about western society and what all our advancements have brought us , but at what cost . 
  and then : is it all really worth it ? 
  what do have to show for it ? 
  says the man using a computer to type on the internet . 
  and who probably lives in a house , and likes medicine . 
  and automobiles . 
  and etc etc christ , it 's true what they say . 
  everything 's amazing but no one is happy . 
   so we should do it all for them , and trash all morals our country was built on , and go so much further into debt that the government will have to sell us all as slaves to pay it off ? 
  choo choo , all aboard the hyperbolic strawman train !, 
  next stop : crazy junction !, 
  since when is your country built upon the idea of letting the misfortunate die ? 
   obama is already instigating public healthcare , which we ca n't afford . 
  our nhs ( which covers us all ) costs half of what your system does . 
  the fact that you 've got a horrible system where insurance companies can literally get away with turning away dying people , does not mean the idea of healthcare itself is flawed . 
  you seem to be completely absorbed in the just world hypothesis . 
  you literally can not comprehend people ending up in misfortunate situations that you have not been in yourself , and thus you just assume they 're abusing the system to get ` free handouts ' . 
  oh by the way , in your previous post :  i know there are a hundred billionaires who hardly work inthe us , but the majority of actually rich people here did it by saving profusely , working hard in school , job hunting like a cheetah , and working overtime . 
  an interesting claim !, 
  may i see some figures to back that up ? 
   handouts breed inadequecy and drug addiction and money abuse again , if that were the case countries will such excellent social safety nets such as sweden would be third-rate shitholes . 
  oh boy here we go , that old ` they 're poor because they 're lazy ! ', 
  argument . 
  [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just-world_hypothesis] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just-world_hypothesis ) if social safety nets were the only reason behind unemployment and the poor being a downtrodden underclass , it 'd be sweden collapsing , and not greece . 
  we would have . 
  if you refuse something like that , you 're showing them you do n't care for their views , and will actually drive them into the snps arms . 
  personally , i think we should run a ` let scotland remain in the uk ' referendum in england / wales / n ireland at the same time as the scottish one . 
  edit : i should clarify as to why . 
  an opinion that i 'm starting to regularly see , and i share in some aspects , is resentment towards scotland . 
  they seem to the casual observer to have everything better than england .
