  yes , because russia has never mistreated people . 
  what do you man ` higher than hitler 's ' ? 
   while most americans have never left the us , most europeans have never left europe . 
  we just call our states `` countries '' so that we can feel more `` international '' . 
  please do n't make fun of the americans like that . 
  slave soldiers have never really worked , unless ( wait for it ) you 're the mongols . 
   what you have to understand that finnish regards independence as the only way to guarantee existence of the finnish people . 
  there are only 5 million of us which makes it possible to ship us to siberia to just die there . 
  that 's something i 've never considered before , since the idea of it happening to us just seems ludicrous . 
  i 've got chills . 
  it begins . 
  would it 's basically `` you 're allowed to complain , but when the president says to do something you damn well do it '' ? 
  to be fair , chamberlain knew hitler was n't going to keep his word . 
  he just also knew that britain was in no state to take the germans on . 
  within a week of the peace in our time nonsense britain had its first industrial overtime . 
  real talk ? 
  what happens if they do ? 
  i think it 's something to do with how french nobility food was completely different to peasant food , whereas english was just better quality peasant food . 
  lark tongues versus lamprey pie , etc. 
  i wonder if some officials in ukraine are tempted to put up a similar billboard , but with the ukrainian flag on one side and a blood-dripping soviet banner on the other . 
  that 's what i was thinking , yeah . 
  they accept the british ( read : correct ) spelling of english words though , so there 's that . 
  the portugese one has the brazilian flag next to it as well, 
  link , please ? 
  the film make so much more sense if you think of them not as aliens , but demons . 
  story time !, 
  chamberlain was not a coward or an idiot . 
  he was a pragmatist . 
  he knew hitler would not keep to his word , but he also knew that britain was in no state industry-wise to take germany on in a war . 
  the very day he got back from meeting them and made the ` peace in our time ' speech , he met with industry leaders to organise . 
  the very first official overtime happened that week . 
  it 's estimated that by letting germany annex czechslovakia , britain stopped the war from breaking out for a year - a year which was spent getting ready for it . 
  quick question to everyone : it 's been , what sixty years or so since nuclear weaponry was invented ? 
  do we not have * any * sort of defence against them ? 
  a way to stop the nuclear material within detonating , a way to shoot the missile down before it reaches its target , ** something ** ?!, 
  you 'd think the world would invent some sort of countermeasure rather than just hope it never happens , surely ? 
  look on the bright side !, 
  with technological improvements since the 80s , our chances of surviving and rebuilding from a nuclear exchange are higher than ever !, 
   what would uk reaction be if wales was about to join a russian or chinese union ? 
  i think that 's a little different , considering that a ) the ukraine is n't in a union with russia , 2 ) wales is n't right next to either of those countries , but ukraine is right next to both the eu and russia , and iii ) the genocidal actions of the ( then normans ) that led to wales being in a union with england are not within living memory , being over 900 years ago . 
  oh gosh , i did n't think it was actually going to go this far . 
  what 's going to happen next ? 
  note that this is n't necessarily a showing of support for the idea , but are we ( britain / eu / the west , any of the above ) going to do anything about this militarily ? 
  well played . 
  you had me until the daily mail bit . 
   caught between the devil and the deep blue sea . 
  how does one say that in german ? 
  your legitimacy does n't always take a knocking when you flee your country ( consider the governments that fled to britain during ww2 , like norways ) but considering the history of the soviet union in ukraine and what it did to the people there ... 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1232/ ), 
  i 'm reminded of when norway banned monty python 's life of brian , and in response sweden started advertising it with the line ` the film so funny they banned it in norway ! ', 
  is it only for probes ? 
  does it have certain limitations that would stop it being used on other spacecraft ? 
   one cow was treated for burns , a police spokesman added . 
  did the spokesman then go on to say that it was delicious ? 
  rubber dinghy rapids , bro !, 
  between the country spying on its own citizens , and the country spying on all citizens everywhere in the world , i know which one is the bigger problem . 
  those kids are so late 80s / early 90s , to boot . 
  oh boy , here we go . 
  another soapbox prophet saying that the world is going to shit because they 're not letting the church rule them . 
  not quite what you 're asking for , but homosexuality is very much present within the animal kingdom , which lends further evidence to it being a genetic thing . 
  ( [ wiki article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexual_behavior_in_animals ) , [ another one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior ) ) i believe the leading theory for it is that it 's a natural way of increasing the amount of individuals who can find food / look after young / look out for predators etc , without increasing the breeding population . 
  aah , right , methane output . 
  i knew cheese was bad for you in excess , but i never knew that !, 
  yes , because banks exploiting those without economics knowledge is the same as me shooting myself in the head . 
  boy , you sure are good at analogies . 
  to be fair , last time i checked car or cheese salesmen did n't cause a global financial crisis . 
  or give themselves huge bonuses while fucking over their customers . 
  oh boy , here we go . 
  get ready , because this is going to get ignorant and bigoted . 
  well , right off the bat i can say that learning a foreign language almost makes me wish we 'd gone further with the empire . 
  it certainly makes me think that english is objectively a better language . 
  the reasons for this are two-fold . 
  1 ) we do n't give every noun a gender ( it 's a table !, 
  it has no genitals !, 
  ) ; and b ) we do n't have the spelling of simple words ( * the , a , his * etc ) and verbs ( * running , working , seeing * etc ) change with the corresponding noun 's gender and its place within the sentence . 
  off the top of my head , look at the german word ' * ihr * ' . 
  according to duolingo i know 15 forms of it . 
  which i have to use is entirely dependent on the gender of the noun its used with and the case of said noun . 
  that 's * insane * . 
  should have clarified , sorry . 
  i meant real german language content . 
  i 'm currently on duolingo anyway . 
  ... can i use this as an opportunity to rant about foreign languages ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'll be damned if i 'm just yet another monolingual brit my whole life , but i usually feel the need to vent after lessons because god dammit . 
  on that note , does anyone know of some online german resources i can read / listen to in my spare time ? 
  i 'm currently trying to learn german . 
  emphasis on trying . 
  it 's a small fine in the grand scheme of things , but perhaps that 's a good thing ? 
  if it were outrageously large google could just dismiss them as doing it for the money . 
  by having it a much more reasonable amount for them to afford , it becomes about the law . 
   and the vast majority of people go to other areas where knowledge of programming is useless the same could be said for nearly all of maths ( especially algebra ) , literature studies and history studies . 
  they teach you * how * to think . 
  so even if you do n't necessarily use those subjects much in your day-to-day life , they 're still useful skills to have . 
  can i just say that i am ** insanely ** jealous of all of that ? 
  the most computer teaching we got was in secondary school , and even then it was just how to use word and publisher ( and maybe excel if you were really clever ) . 
  we did n't get taught how to work computers , we got taught to be office mice . 
  i seem to remember that the eu funded the abilities course the job centre put me on , which led to me currently being at college on a software development course . 
  so i 'd say so , yes . 
  op , if you do n't mind me asking how easy was it for you to move to germany ? 
  how much money did it cost you , and what are you doing for work right now ?
