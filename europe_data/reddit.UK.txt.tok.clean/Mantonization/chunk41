  trust the swiss to chime in about gold, 
  we 've discussed things , and we 've decided that you do n't need to buy any rounds this time . 
  however , you are obligated to join in when poland and croatia show up , and we go shout at france 's house while drunk, 
  what purity of gold ? 
  there there greece . 
  us , switzerland and norway were gon na go on a pub crawl , sod their party !, 
  again , i do n't think so . 
  such people actually exist, 
  hooray for you !, 
  i do n't think he is . 
  you could say he 's a horrible person , but i do n't think he 's a troll . 
  and our ` bbc ' and ` pasties ' . 
  we 're all a bunch of right bastards, 
   this strategy is pig disgusting cockroach british level , i did n't expect it from germany . 
  mate , did we , like , conquer your country during our empire days or something ? 
  because i honestly do n't understand your problem . 
  and yet they just clamped down on marijuana . 
  it 's like freedom in the netherlands is a zero sum game or something . 
  no , seriously , congrats . 
  weather 's crap , sod you all . 
  i 'm joking , of course . 
  about the sodding bit , not the weather . 
  happy europe day , i guess ? 
  i suppose i could celebrate by eating a kabanos or something ... 
  merci , good sir . 
  hmm , reading this i may have to agree with what others have said . 
  he does sound a bit smug and / or ignorant, 
  i would literally send money ( or at least , a box of sausage rolls ) to anyone who posts a transcript of this clip . 
  i 'm currently stuck with a computer tower so bad , i ca n't play videos . 
  it 's that stereotype that they have no sense of humour . 
  they don '' t find it funny . 
  [ ** meanwhile , on the other side of the atlantic ** ] ( http://nation.foxnews.com/francois-hollande/2012/05/06/france-elects-socialist-president ) ( just scroll straight down to comments ), 
  your question was n't very clear , and the ` how will this affect americans ' thing you put at the front of your post makes people assume the rest of it 's going to be something other than what it was . 
  nah , they 're just better at stopping it . 
  when they want it , they 're just as good at it as everyone else, 
  that 's just as bad . 
  no possible replacement country name could ever hope to even come close to ` united kingdom ' . 
  you ca n't top that . 
  there 's something almost magical about it . 
  whereas anything with ` republic ' in it sounds like a boring place where there 's literally no colour or happiness . 
  blurgh , i say !, 
  i 'm surprised the dutch government did n't see this coming, 
  my first thought : bloody hell , ** what ** ?!, 
  that takes serious balls . 
  my second though : scrap metal thieves , i should have known . 
  i ** hate ** scrap metal thieves with a passion . 
  now ; i 'm quite liberal ; and believe in rehabilitation more than vengeance , but bearing in mind the amount of damage they cause i would happily have them all lined up against a wall and shot . 
  i hate them so bloody much . 
  they are the lowest of the low . 
  good news for europe really , since le pen seems to be a french equivalent to nick griffin and the bnp . 
  well , yes , it would be the only option . 
  if we got rid of our constitutional monarchy ( lord knows why you 'd want to do that though ) and switched to a republic , we would have to swap from kingdom to republic in the name . 
  that 's how naming works . 
  i beg to differ , it works very well . 
  ` united republic ' just sound stupid . 
  a vale-what now ? 
  [ well , here 's a list of ` gaffes ' made by our prince philip . 
  ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-philip-quotes-relive-90-133848 ) i say ` gaffes ' because they 're mostly just an old man giving zero fucks and saying what he likes . 
  our royals are pretty dull , really . 
  they never do anything scandalous . 
   norway  insane pastors what ? 
  most brits probably do n't even know it exists . 
  ` fog in channel : continent cut off ' and all that . 
  to be fair , this new and emerging idea that everyone should just work until they literally drop dead of old age is n't that great either . 
  his reasoning is probably similar to the reasoning behind the fact that people who work less hours than those who work huge amounts are usually more productive . 
  or perhaps it 's like how if you 're forced to do something , you usually ca n't wait until it ' over . 
  but if you 're allowed to leave whenever , you find yourself sticking around and doing more . 
  it seems clear that big changes to the eu are needed to stop it collapsing , but what ? 
  take pride in the fact that we made something to fail . 
  granted a participation ribbon is n't as good as a medal , but it 's better than nothing . 
  in america ? 
   man let me tell you , the german mindset when it comes to organising and running things is spectacularly inefficient . 
  how so ? 
  you 're the first person i 've heard of in a while who wants to move to the united states . 
  why ? 
  sure why not , i 'd be down with that . 
  we do n't even have that at the moment though . 
  you 're implying that school shooting numbers is purely controlled by gun numbers , and that is completely untrue . 
  it 's socio-economic factors more than anything , and lax regulatory standards . 
  swords only exist to kill things , bows only exist to kill things , yet we 're allowed to own them ( do n't even need a license in britain , just need to be over 18 to buy ) and we use them in sport . 
  do you want those banned as well ? 
   i 'm glad people do n't have easy access to carving knifes in this country . 
  there are entirely too many people i would n't trust with a spoon , let alone a blade designed to stab people . 
   the legitimate reasons for people have carving knifes that can stab people are few . 
  cutting food is perhaps one . 
   but other than that well-circumscribed exception , people living in a civilised democracy do n't need carving knifes . 
  this is how silly you sound, 
   what legitimate activities are you prevented from doing ? 
  shooting , obviously . 
  it 's a legitimate , fun sport , and as it is we do n't even allow our bloody olympic shooters to train in the country . 
  it 's ridiculous our current gun laws are too restrictive , based on knee-jerk reactions when one nut shot some people in the 80s / 90s . 
  criminals ( by definition do n't obey the law anyway ) , so it 's a rather meaningless ban meant purely to hinder honest citizens and give the sense of false safety to stupid middle-class housewifes . 
   but other than these well-circumscribed exceptions , people living in a civilised democracy do n't need killing machines . 
  you can kill people with anything . 
  should be ban hammers and screwdrivers ? 
  people could still strangle others !, 
  we better ban hands !, 
  owning a carving knife does not make you a slasher , owning a lighter does not make you an arsonist , owning a gun does not make you a killer . 
  thinking that it 's only for killing people is ( for lack of a better word ) very libtarded of you . 
  and that 's coming from a left winger .
