  as long as this does n't turn into a ` ban all the guns think of the children ' circlejerk , then i suppose i 'm for it . 
  as it is , i think our weapon laws are too restrictive . 
  it 's been consistently shown that pirates buy more than non-pirates . 
  piracy is not an issue of ` people want shit for free ' , it 's a service issue . 
  if pirating a game is more convenient and easier than buying it , people will do it . 
  industries need to adapt and improve , rather than try destroy it . 
  [ gabe newell explains it perfectly ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plc_zz5fqfk ) ( skip to a minute in ) . 
  another example : assassin 's creed 2 for pc . 
  to try combat piracy , ubisoft made it so you have to be online at all times , otherwise you can not play this singleplayer game . 
  and then their servers went down for weeks . 
  people who legitimately bought the game could not play it , while pirates could . 
  they 're shit too . 
  i blame thatcher . 
  you ca n't privatise rail like that because it 's inherently non-competitive . 
  if it was good for europe , we would n't be in such dire straits . 
  i just think that there must be some significance to it , as it 's already abundantly clear that the setting is france , so having it be the french flag just to point out where the cartoon is supposed to be set just seems redundant . 
  assuming it is n't just to point out where the cartoon is set , i think the fact that hollande is knitting the french flag is meant to be a point in his favour , to show that he 's perhaps more interested in france or wants to work for the betterment of it . 
  okay , so , the rooster ( french national animal ) has sarkozy 's face , perhaps implying that sarkozy is ( or at least , thinks he is ) an embodiment of france . 
  and him getting his head cut off is an obvious metaphor for him losing badly , and given the context of the guillotining of french nobles during the revolution , perhaps it 's meant to imply that he somehow deserves it . 
  hollande as the old woman is showing that they 're just watching as sarkozy 's power is beheaded , perhaps to imply that hollande does n't really have to try to win against sarkozy . 
  and him knitting the french flag is perhaps to imply that he 's somehow ` more french ' than sarkozy . 
  and le pen ( that 's her name , right ? ), 
  is a nazi , and a shitty person who comes from the shitty end of sarkozy 's reign . 
  or something like that , i 'm probably just talking bull . 
  for some reason , people seem to think that wisdom is always something that comes from somewhere far away . 
  i wonder if there are people in china who wish to travel to , i do n't know , swindon , and hear the wisdom of old people there . 
  she did n't sound very bright, 
  and you decided to make said nazi monkeys carry a british flag because ... ? 
  oh , is the guy dressed as an old woman meant to be chirac ? 
  i think i remember reading somewhere that you would usually see old women at public guillotining 's during * la grande terreur * , always at the front and either quietly knitting or cheering them on . 
  maybe it 's something to do with that ? 
  what an excellent point sir , may i offer a rebuttal ? 
  go fuck yourself with a cactus . 
  it is ridiculous of you to suggest that the people of britain somehow deserve economic misery , simply because we did n't mindlessly bend over and take a tax that would have financially crippled us . 
  you can lead a horse to water , but you ca n't make it drown itself . 
  i ** think ** i understand what this is trying to say , but i 'll be damned if i could put it into words . 
  well , they can talk about it , but will they actually do anything ? 
  i may be downvoted for this , but am i the only one who does n't flip out and start quoting george orwell when i see this sort of thing ? 
  i mean , surely an identity card that you can use instead of having to carry separate drivers licence / passports / ni number is a good option , right ? 
  amen to that !, 
  i 'm sorry , you 're going to call other countries shitty ? 
  ** you ** ? 
  europe may have problems , but we do n't have a ** quarter ** of the fucked-up shit that you have . 
  i 'm not talking about civil protests , but full blown riots . 
  but yes , i 'm for civil protests , they should be happening . 
  ugh , again ? 
  how much money are we expected to give before this problem goes away ? 
  at this stage , i wonder if it 'd be better to just cut our losses . 
  i 'm quite ignorant though , so make of that what you will . 
  i know what you mean . 
  the front page of / r/europe seems positively apocalyptic today . 
  people are pissed off , and they do n't feel anything close to justice has been done . 
  let 's wait a little longer , and see how things turn out , before we start burning merkozy effigies though, 
  does this mean france will stop just letting illegal immigrants move through their country to calais and from there britain ? 
  you ca n't just ignore legal contracts like that . 
  it 's incredibly bad for your country in the long run , as you 've shown the world your untrustworthiness . 
   super president how do we make one of those then ? 
  do we throw the current eu president in nuclear waste ? 
  i 'm not sure i 'm reading this right . 
  greece is blaming germany for selling greece weaponry ? 
  could n't greece just - you know - ** not ** buy weapons ? 
  nobody is forcing them to . 
  nuclear explosions invest a lot of energy into areas as well , does n't necessarily make them good . 
  sarkozy is a * petit caporal * who tries to ignore the fundamental fact that politics is about compromise . 
  i can assure you that the majority of brits did n't even know this was happening , and of that do , most do not support it . 
  this is the sort of thing that pushed me very firmly into the pro-eu camp . 
  we need to come together , so we can tell america and others to piss off . 
  for fuck sake, 
  says the faroe islands . 
  at least ours do n't have flippers . 
  remind me why we listen to these people , again ? 
   then why are you still here in the eu bitching , and why because they do n't represent the uk . 
  they 're just the loudest bitchers . 
  that said , the eu does have a massive pr problem in britain . 
  and cricket . 
  which may have been a mistake , since they 're often better than us at it . 
  i think the feeling is that the cons would leave britain ruined , while the pros are chump change at best . 
  besides , right from the start the eu 's agricultural policy seems to be about putting french farmers on an unassailable pedestal . 
   we wo n't be as good as we could be we 're not as good as we could be now . 
  we 've been in a constant decline since the end of the second world war , in power , influence , relevance , all that stuff . 
  that 's undeniable . 
  i 'm afraid that this trend will continue , and before you know it we 'll be a nobody state at best , a failed state at worst . 
  we may be muddling along , but that 'll be it . 
  again , i 'm afraid i must mention germany . 
  they managed to pull themselves up into the european power . 
  why ca n't we manage something like that ? 
  it 's amazing how the government seems determined to rattle as many sabres and piss off as many countries as possible . 
  it 's not like we have a monopoly on comedy, 
   pillage buenos aires ooh , ooh , can we do it ? 
  we 've been wanting to for a while . 
  again , it 's the european union , not the wholly german empire . 
  germany is not the sole person involved in rule-making , nor is it the sole rule breaker . 
  ( yes , i am going to keep using that pun ), 
  everyone has been breaking the rules . 
  germany 's just the teachers pet that 's getting ganged up on . 
  consider how we were at the end of ww2 , both politically and economically . 
  europe is rising , and will continue to do so for hopefully a long time , or at least until we reach a nice sustainable plateau . 
  i think it will become a more politically integrated union ( hopefully a more democratic than autocratic one ) with norway and switzerland perhaps joining . 
  maybe even turkey too , although that might be a bit of a stretch . 
  on a personal level , i hope britain finds its place within the eu , and indeed the world .
