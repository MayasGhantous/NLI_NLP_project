  because the whole thing 's making me a bit depressed . 
  while other european nations ( germany in particular ) have found themselves a new purpose and gone from strength to strength , we 've been in a continual steady decline . 
  it 's ... leaving me a bit scared , to be honest . 
  europe 's future is bright , but i fear britain wo n't be around to see it . 
  oh , why are they doing that ? 
  no worse than any other religion . 
  extremists gon na extreme . 
  what islamisation ? 
  people have the right to believe any old nonsense they wish . 
  i think it 's rather unfair to pin the blame on germany . 
  does the eu have some major problems ? 
  yes . 
  does it require some serious changes ? 
  very likely . 
  however , the eu is not a wholly german empire . 
  blame the rules and try to change them . 
  do n't blame the ones who follow the rules and try to change them instead . 
  considering that ww1 started because a bloke called archie duke shot an ostrich because he was hungry , i disagree . 
  that 's in south italy , i presume ? 
  i suppose because that while we 're not all on the same mental page , we 're at least all reading from the same book . 
  this is most prominent politically , with such things as social safety nets , healthcare , war and peace . 
  we implement them differently ( some more so than others ) but we 're all thinking on the right lines . 
  i guess the former ? 
  instead of people from a certain constituency voting for an mp to go to that countries parliament , it would be people from a certain country voting for an mp to go to the european parliament . 
  there 's a lot of things i do n't like , but at the end of the day the place is better off for its presence . 
  as for your second question : i 've no idea . 
  i 'm not well read into forms of government , so i ca n't give an informed opinion . 
  but i think something that is more democratic than autocratic would be best . 
  parliament rather than king , if you get my drift . 
  it 's a pigeon language formed from norman conquerors and anglo saxon conquered having to communicate . 
  and when the black death happened , pretty much everyone who spoke french died , so the pigeon language that is english became dominant . 
  that does n't really count . 
  we were n't owned by the dutch , we just had a dutch king . 
  a very good dutch king . 
  even if we did end up having a gin epidemic because of him . 
  [ all right , we 'll call it a draw . 
  let 's not get ahead of ourselves . 
  you 've still got bono to answer for . 
  yes , and that 's what the whole ` having your freedoms removed and being consigned to prison ' thing is . 
  unless you 're suggesting we bring back thumbscrews ? 
  that 's okay , we wo n't forgive you for trying to bomb thatcher and failing, 
  i 'll just repost what i 've said in / r/worldnews  good . 
  now he can stand trial . 
   and he will be put in a fantastic norwegian prison , and then will be rehabilitated and ( hopefully , assuming he 's deemed changed enough ) released back into society . 
   ** because that is what justice is about . 
  not vengeance , rehabilitation **, 
  some days notwithstanding , of course . 
  we 're sorry about cromwell , all right ? 
  we just told him to go deal with some rebels , and things got a little out of hand . 
  followed orders a little too much to the letter . 
  wish we had that ` german problem ', 
  aah , those were the days ... 
  got up on the wrong side of the * lit * this morning , did we ? 
  yes , well , you know the difference between brits and germans when it comes to comedy . 
  wow , seriously ? 
  you 're going to kill the mood like that ? 
  well , thanks . 
  i hope you 're happy now . 
  shhh , do n't spoil the moment !, 
  we 're not completely crap !, 
  well then , it 's obvious that for interests of continental security , britain france and germany should push forward their joint research into cyborg knights . 
  if only we had a constant supply of brains to put in them . 
  thanks . 
  now let 's see ... 
  we 're number 18th !, 
  we 're number 18th !, 
  i tried to find the list in that huge report thing , but it 's like trying to find a needle in a haystack . 
  a haystack that 's also made of needles . 
   bullet pens and jet fighters made out of multiple bullet casings ... 
  i guess i love tack then , because those sound quite interesting . 
  what 's next ? 
  apologising to the descendants of the romans ? 
  that might be nice . 
  it occurred to me the other day that when we went on a camping trip to france , years ago when i was little , we just drove our car straight off the ferry and to the site , without needing a french license or anything . 
  it turns out that was because of the eu . 
  so , that 's a good thing it 's done , and this will be good as well , i guess . 
   i 'm not defending the ira but do n't you dare defend the atrocities your government committed in northern ireland . 
  as if i 'd do that !, 
  christ on a bike , credit me with ** some ** morals !, 
  well then , congratulations hungary !, 
  i raise my mug to you !, 
  while both did horribly things , i do n't think my government is down there on the same level as terrorists . 
  and that 's good , yes ? 
   so what you 're saying is that you hate people ? 
  because `` thiefs '' are , you know , real people . 
   so what you 're saying is that you hate people ? 
  because `` smugglers '' are , you know , real people . 
   so what you 're saying is that you hate people ? 
  because `` muggers '' are , you know , real people . 
  and so on . 
  well , as long as they 're not put in there for too long before being deported , i suppose i 'm fine with that . 
  it is offensive to make a vampire joke ? 
  something along the lines of ` blood or money , romania just seems to be full of vampires ' ? 
  i want to know before i say anything . 
  ** genius **, 
  [ but what do you know . 
  you 're just a window cleaner ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhw9bv09xrs ), 
  this is assuming , of course , that companies do n't just relocate to the far east or africa or whatever , and use slave labour for pennies . 
  it 's more of an envy joke , to be honest .
