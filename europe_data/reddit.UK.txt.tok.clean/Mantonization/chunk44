  sorry canada , but no can do . 
  you 've been hanging around with your big brother for too long now . 
  the rot has started to set in . 
  edit : i keep forgetting that trying to act facetious or joking in a purely text-based medium does n't work unless you point it out . 
  which is ... great !, 
  good for them . 
  lucky lucky ol' germans . 
  assuming your first sentence is true : why english ? 
  it 's not the most spoken language in europe or anything like that . 
  we have n't really been relevant as a world power in a long time , and the feelings between us and europe could probably be said to be ` stretched ' on both sides at best . 
  what 's so great about our language ? 
  i mean , it 's easy to swear in , but that 's about it . 
  crazy religious fanatics who wanted to ban sport , pubs , and fun .

  once you have read this , piss off to / r/iwantout oh , also . 
  you 're not english , irish or scottish . 
  you 're american . 
  yes , this does bear repeating . 
  what is it with you guys and this obsession with saying you 're anything but american , anyway ? 
  america on saint patrick 's day for example . 
  i do n't think the eu will agree on making english the official language though , and even if they did i do n't think most countries would approve of being forced to speak our language . 
  christ . 
  do you think that sort of thinking will die out in generations to come ? 
  i 'd like to think so . 
  unless putin sets the clock back , or something . 
  healthcare . 
  -- europe, 
  well ** excuuuse us ** !, 
  ** someone ** has to look out for the important issues !, 
  thanks for the info !, 
  these bits in particular :  of making a color combination illegal  from what we 'd learned in school it was you , the poor proletariat of evil capitalist hellholes who were supposed to be barely surviving . 
  completely blow my mind !, 
  that 's nuts !, 
  well , what about the hole in flag revolutions , and the crumbling of the ussr and end of the cold war that followed ? 
  do you have any specific memories on those events ? 
  and your childhood sounded lovely . 
  wish our village had its own library !, 
  that 's ... almost impressive . 
  shockingly disgraceful , of course , but damn . 
   it matters because such a hugely symbolic position - the head of state of a world power - should be the preserve of the people , not of the unelected elite . 
  but they are a figurehead of the people . 
  they have to constantly represent the very best of british values . 
  that 's why the king refused to flee to canada during ww2 , why his wife spent her nights visiting people huddled in tube stations . 
  why liz ii was an army mechanic , and they all demanded to be rationed as much as everyone else right up until rationing ended . 
  or to give more modern examples , it 's why the queen has constantly served parliament and the country . 
  if they 're representative of an unelected elite , it 's the same way captain america is for the us . 
  ( i 'm going somewhere with this , trust me ) . 
  captain america is technically representative of an unelected elite , since he 's a product of the massive us military , but he still represents the people , and does so wonderfully . 
  i mean , maybe . 
  i 'm not exactly on top form either . 
  it is late . 
   only someone born into or marry into the royal family can be the head of state . 
  why does it matter ? 
  they have no power outside what parliament allows , so why does it ? 
  you could argue that that 's the point of the whole thing , really . 
  that having the head of state be a powerless , unelected apolitical figure , while the government and its pm does all the running , is a good thing . 
  because it means you can dislike the person running the country without being dubbed as hating the country itself , or being unpatriotic or something . 
  see for example : any american president . 
   but while the head of state is unelected , the powers can not be given back . 
  well , yes they can . 
  because , as i 've said before , it 's parliament that run the show . 
  the royals are no longer invulnerable , if they tried to become dictatorial ( or just did n't do what parliament said , without massive public support ) they would be removed . 
  besides , even if we ignore all of that , and the money they bring in , we would have to rename the place to the united republic . 
  which sounds awful . 
  and why do you think that ? 
  why are you comparing secular movements to brejvik ? 
  you know he was an insane christian who fancied himself as a crusading templar , right ? 
  ** good sir , i reject that notion ** !, 
  if such a thing had worked last time , but ( for the sake of keeping this alternate history in tune enough with our own to make a fair comparison ) the constitutional monarchy was put in place anyway , you would be praising the name of cromwell day in and day out !, 
  cromwell is a clear example of what happens when republicanism is instated in this fair land , and it was a disaster . 
  a ** disaster ** , sir !, 
  that does ** not ** , i hasten to add , mean that such a thing could not work in this country !, 
  perish the thought !, 
  it could , in fact , work very well !, 
  but the long and short of it is , old boy , ** that it happened ** !, 
  you ca n't just brush it off !, 
  in fact , i say to you now that you must learn from the mistakes of cromwell , or else you are doomed to repeat them !, 
  ** doomed , i say !, 
  if it had worked last time ( but the constitutional monarchy had returned anyway ) you 'd be singing cromwell 's name to the bloody heavens . 
  cromwell is what happened when people tried to put republicanism in britain . 
  and it was a disaster . 
  that is not to say however , that the concept could never work in britain . 
  you have to acknowledge the past , and learn from it , or you 'll just repeat the mistakes . 
  for which one ? 
  we 've always been restraining the power of monarchy since the magna carta , leaving us with the good bits , and we 've cut the heads off of those who overstepped their boundaries . 
  plus the last republican we had running the country turned out to be a bit of a dictator who wanted to ban fun . 
  can you blame us ? 
  gensek , do you mind if i ask more about that ? 
  what year in the ussr , what was it like , etc etc ? 
  my apologies if i 'm intruding , and i know this is off topic . 
  i just have an interest in the whole time period . 
  it 's the same logic libertarians use . 
  they see that previous uses of the philosophy were almost total failures , but they just hand-wave that away , thinking that it 's just because they were n't doing them right . 
  as long as people are people , communism ( or libertarianism , to keep the comparison going ) will not work . 
  ever . 
   uk has much more in common with the us than the eu no it bloody does n't !, 
  we speak the same language , but that 's it !, 
  we may not always be on the same page with europe , but at least we 're reading the same book !, 
  if the republicans somehow win this year , the only good things that will come of it is america finally getting tired of their bullshit , and britain moving closer to europe . 
  i 'm not an advocate of the death penalty , but some things make me angry enough to briefly consider it .
