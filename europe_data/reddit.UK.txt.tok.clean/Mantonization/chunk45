  it 's fucking sickening . 
  why would those be the only choices ? 
  that makes absolutely zero sense . 
  you 're talking about the continent that practically invented democracy . 
  the greeks specifically , and later the romans / italians . 
  you know , the people your constitution is based off of ? 
  then you 've got us with our magna carta back in the early half of the last millennium , before your continent was even discovered by europe . 
  and do n't even get me started on france !, 
  this is an incredibly convoluted scenario you 've envisioned . 
  so convoluted i 'm increasingly convinced you just wanted a circlejerk . 
  why are these our only choices , and what does this have to do with europe ? 
  my cynicism is telling me you 've mistakenly thought we 'd circlejerk with you over american paperwork . 
  we 've pretty much got them , but they 're not called marriages . 
  although that 's apparently set to change very soon , so we 'll have the whole package , as it were . 
   but i hesitate to believe that the my-nation 's - dick-is-bigger-than-your 's game is still going on ? 
  you 're naive if you think it ever stopped . 
  it 's clear taking the piss is a foreign language to you . 
   `` britain needs to know that we in germany want a strong britain in the eu , we always have and we always will . '', 
  that 's nice to hear from germany , but we know that . 
  just get france to say it . 
  go on . 
  get sarkozy in front of a mic ( get him a box to stand on if it 's too high up ) and get him to say those words on camera . 
  and if you ** really ** want us placated , go for gold and get him to apologise for france vetoing our first two eu entry attempts . 
  yes , i am just being facetious . 
  kind of . 
  thanks , i guess ? 
  i ca n't tell if you 're being sarcastic or not . 
  how do you suggest we deal with these pirates ? 
  give them all a fuzzy jumper and a cuddle ? 
  you can probably chalk up a lot of evil in the world to this problem . 
  it 's why people are apathetic about a genocidal warlord half the world away , but will feud , fight and possibly murder their neighbour over a garden hedge being too tall . 
  devils advocate : the mafia and such is n't something very ` out in the open ' to most people . 
  it 's hard to keep the hate up on something if you never see it . 
  but if it 's something close to home - say , some gypsies squatting nearby and committing crime - then it 's something you can easily and continuously get angry over . 
  ** note : the above does not necessarily represent my own view **, 
  when ** britain ** pretty much owned the entire planet , i think you mean !, 
   source : a russian entrepreneur who ended up on the lethal side of a kalashnikov four months later . 
  well now you 've said that , you simply ** must ** tell us the full story !, 
  same . 
  i 'm of firm believe that norway 's justice / prison system is the best in the world . 
  it 's not his logic , he 's pointing out the poor logic used by muslim terrorists . 
  they 're too busy making test-tube burgers . 
   what could we do about it ? 
  hmm , i 'm not sure . 
  it 's a foundation problem , is n't it ? 
  it 's built on soft ground , which is sinking into the water . 
  could n't we create a concrete foundation underneath the city ? 
  or something you 'd need a lot of concrete . 
  says / new / incarnate !, 
  lol i get it !, 
  it 's because the french are cowards !, 
  christ , are you yanks ** still ** butthurt about them not following you into that shitty iraq war ? 
  if every time privatization happens , everyone except the rich bastards suffers , maybe it 's not everyone else that 's the problem ? 
  the question is , what do we do about it ? 
  the normans were n't french . 
  they were scandinavian . 
  they may have spoke french , but they were a separate group from the franks ( who would later become french ), 
  the thing is though , i feel that the language barrier is too high . 
  sure , i did a few years of french and one year of german in school , but in practical terms i might as well know nothing . 
  so if i try and learn the language beforehand , and try speak a few phrases during , i ** will ** look like a complete idiot . 
  and if i just go in assuming they 'll speak english , that 'd be even worse . 
  i 'd be an arsehole as well as an idiot . 
  if you 're going around christmas time , i recommend cologne in germany . 
  the christmas market at the base of the obscenely large black cathedral is simply magical . 
  yes , i know , it 's weird . 
  maybe it 's the shared borders , or the common language / culture , i dunno . 
  i suppose i feel the same way about british ... ness , that some feel about being european . 
  if we had an equivalent word for ` gaijin ' , i 'd use it . 
   who in the eu is supporting transaction tax ? 
  not sweden , i bet . 
  they 're not mutually exclusive , but i suppose britain comes first . 
  god save the queen and all that . 
  no offence , but i just do n't really ** feel ** european . 
  maybe i just need to travel more , but you 're all just foreigners to me . 
  that 's not meant to be malicious in the slightest understand , you 're just people who are too comfortably ` somewhere else ' for me to feel any large amount of kinship to . 
  well , you 're either inoffensively ` over there ' or ( from what the media portrays ) here to tell us what to do . 
  sorry about that . 
  i do n't see why we 're getting singled out . 
  we 're hardly the only nation to have ever argued with them . 
  unless the article writer is still mad that we do n't like the whole ` prisoners should be allowed to vote while in prison ' thing ? 
  either way , this is a non-issue . 
  we end up doing more eu stuff than most anyway . 
  we 're just not docile about it , that 's all . 
  edit : so apparently he 's bringing up abu qatada . 
  of course we 're mad that the echr says we ca n't deport him . 
  why would n't we be ? 
  if you say you would n't feel the same if such a man were in your country , then you are a liar . 
  however , for all our bitching and moaning , we concede the points that the echr has given . 
  you 'll notice we have n't just ignored them and deported him anyway . 
  so again , this is a non-issue . 
  i wish the dutch would hurry up with their artificial meat . 
  then we could get artificial fish . 
  well , i hope they catch the bastard . 
  that 's all i can really say . 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
   we sell the stuff , it 's not our place to care about what they do with it ( unless it endangers us ) . 
  what a terrible point of view . 
  it 's that sort of attitude that allows evil to exist . 
  would you be okay with a company in the eu willingly and knowingly selling arms and ammo to a warlord bent on genocide ? 
  after all , it 's not our place to care about what it 's used for , right ?!,
