  well what else can we do ? 
  short of refusing to participate , nothing . 
  but it might reduce the number of executions , since we 're the main supplier of the barbiturates . 
  which itself is confusing , since surely you 'd want to be the country that has the least amount of executions ( and ergo , the least amount of death-penalty crime ) ? 
  did n't we already talk about this months ago ? 
  either way , it 's a good thing . 
  yes , places that allow execution will be almost certainly be able to get the drugs elsewhere . 
  but we will no longer be a part of the process , which is a good moral stand to take . 
  eugh , never mind then . 
  i 'd totally go for chocolate truffles that were also psychedelic . 
  truffles as in the fungus ? 
  or truffles as in those chocolate praline things ? 
  my sympathies to the families , etc etc. 
  how odd though . 
  who 's got a beef against french soldiers ? 
  i guess pro-gaddafi libyans , but that 's all i can really think of . 
  i 'm reminded of when i only found out that the eu was planning its own military after britain vetoed it , because it just had n't come up in the news at all . 
  i 'm fine with the idea , but it has to be done in the open , completely and utterly . 
  we 'll get through it . 
  we always do . 
  the paranoid part of me suspects lobbyists have something to do with it . 
  oh , that reminds me . 
  what happened to merkel personally supporting sarkozys campaign ? 
  key points :  * the new deal sets an annual eu quota of 48,200 tonnes for high-quality north american beef from cattle that have not been treated with growth hormones . 
  *  * north america will lift import tariffs on a range of european farm produce . 
  *  * an eu ban on hormone-treated meat and meat products remains in place , even though the world trade organization ( wto ) ruled in 1997 that it was illegal . 
  *  * meanwhile , the eu is urging the us to lift a 15-year-old ban on imports of eu beef . 
  it was imposed because of us concerns about mad-cow disease ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or bse ) . 
  *  * last week a us agriculture department agency recommended that the ban be lifted . 
  * well , that 's good all around , is n't it !, 
  we get more good-quality american stuff , they get more good-quality european stuff , and we still do n't have to let companies get away with importing shitty , hormone-saturated meat !, 
  north vs south could probably work in the us as well , if you replace money for progress in general . 
  put the kettle on !, 
   `` i had the impression i was listening not to a french president ... but almost to a conservative british prime minister , '' said mr. sarkozy 's chief opponent , socialist party leader fran\u00e7ois hollande . 
  well that 's not very nice , is it . 
  well if you 've got some magical instant european fix with no side effects , please , ** do share ** . 
  i 've heard it said that the north of italy is resentful of the south of italy , because they believe that they do all the work while the south does all the play and uses all the money . 
  why would they attack the bbc ? 
  that 's just low . 
  hey , you think we 're happy about this ?!, 
  because we 're not !, 
  it 's the truth . 
  they do n't bother , since they 're only going through their country to ours . 
  we should not extradite to a nation whose prison / justice system is worse than ours . 
  i think we can all agree on this idea . 
  you 're in luck , as there 's a subreddit for this very purpose : / r/iwantout i must also ask that you read this , it 's from a comedy website but i still think it 's worth reading : [ six reasons your plan to move abroad might not work out ] ( http://www.cracked.com/article_19363_6-reasons-your-plans-to-move-abroad-might-not-work-out.html ), 
  if that had been posted to / r/wtf before , then yes . 
  but it has n't . 
  therefore you 're wrong , and should shush . 
  narrower in some aspects , yes , but much , much wider in others . 
  we 've kinda gotten past the ` political right wing is batshit insane / evil ' stage . 
   spiegel reports this week that the german government did n't reach even half of its planned savings in the federal budget . 
  but then again , germany has been busy trying to keep everyone else together . 
  i hear north korea is a very ronery place to live in . 
  i may be friends with my neighbours , but that does n't give them the right to demand what 's mine is theirs , or vice versa . 
  do n't be stupid , that 's not what i 'm saying at all . 
  what i ** am ** saying is that the french authorities are very lax with the illegal immigrants moving through their country with the intent of smuggling themselves into britain , and that 's not on . 
  they 're hiding in the trucks . 
  we ca n't just stop letting trucks in and out because , you know , those trucks going through calais are valuable for trade . 
  we 're an island nation , we ca n't just lock everything down . 
  besides , europe would give us so much shit if we tried . 
  because we ca n't win either way , it seems . 
  we do ** everything ** possible to combat it , by searching everything that comes through onto our ferries through calais and such . 
  unfortunately , we ca n't catch them all , and the ones we catch we ca n't detain , so they just go off back to their camps to try again tomorrow . 
  the french are doing absolutely nothing about it , since they 're all trying to get to us through them rather than illegally settle in france itself . 
  while i agree that illegal immigrant thing is a serious problem that france must start paying attention to , i do n't think france leaving the schengen accord will leave anyone satisfied . 
  this is probably why i 'm so afraid of travelling to europe . 
  i know a little french ( since i did it at school years ago ) , and i can do some swearing in german , italian and norwegian , but that 's literally it . 
  i 'm afraid to travel abroad , because i 'll look like an idiot for not speaking the language . 
  i disagree . 
  if you show me a crumbling city under one regime , then show it shining bright under a new one , i 'm going to say ` yeah , that new regime looks best ' . 
  unless you think the entirety of germany after reunification was one big potemkin village ? 
  nah , that 's just something the sun made up . 
  even we have standards when it comes to insults , mon ami . 
  i would n't worry too much . 
  of course there 's corruption and incompetence , which must be fought at every turn , but we 're not so far gone as to be completely apathetic . 
  we get very indignant about perceived unfairness . 
  if push came to shove we 'd roll out the guillotine . 
   editor 's note : this is the second in a series of dispatches taking a look at how the upcoming u.s. election is being seen in cities around the world . 
  oh , good . 
  for a second there i was wondering if this article was going to ride on the anti-french attitude propagated in the run-up to the iraq war . 
  aah , right . 
  i forget some places do that . 
  ( i very nearly put ` are strange like that ' but managed to stop myself ) . 
  it is pretty nice that the tories are pushing for it , yeah . 
  a but of a change from blair / brown , i think . 
  although i might be wrong . 
  sometimes i wonder if the tories and labour switched sides one day , and nobody noticed . 
  is that 12.5 or 12 - 5 ? 
  either way , that 's pretty good !, 
  although i think the majority of our acceptance is because we just do n't really care too much about the issue . 
  what consenting people do in their own homes is their own business , and all that . 
  thank god for that . 
  for all its criticisms i 'd prefer the eu to stick around . 
  if we were n't ` thinking european ' we would have just gone for the british guy and left the italian behind . 
  and how in nine circles of hell is this related to the british empire ? 
  i do n't see the angle they 're trying to push there . 
   i presented a fact no you did not . 
  you made a bunch of claims that you have not provided evidence for , but you presented no facts . 
  but it 's ** not ** the same for everyone , at all .
