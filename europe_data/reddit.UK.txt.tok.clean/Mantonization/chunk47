  it would be the same if every single country was a copy-paste and had the exact same number an types of industries , but they do n't . 
  this is a tax on banking . 
  london is the biggest banking area in europe . 
  therefore , the tax would affect britain more than the rest of europe . 
  this is basic logic , man . 
  we would objectively have been worse off , as banks would have ( likely ) done a repeat of what happened in sweden and fled to greener pastures . 
  we could have compromised , and everyone have been happy , but no . 
  sarkozy tried to play hardball , and here we are . 
  all the insults in the world are n't going to get the brits to vote against their interests . 
  have you tried honey instead of vinegar ? 
  i 've seen it , that 's why it came to mind as an example . 
  some people , eh ? 
  but to be fair , some people thought that argentina had invaded one of the scottish isles when the falklands war started . 
  you made the claim , burden of proof is on you to prove it , not on us to disprove it . 
  but i sort of did anyway , since i pointed out that it 's because of those ` poisonous , left wing crooks ' that most of europe has such things as freedom of speech and religion , and socialised medicine . 
  those were n't pushed by the political right . 
  neither were things like workers rights , safety health or environmental laws , and so on . 
  i 'd be willing to bet that if it were n't for the constant pushing of left-wingers , we 'd still be stuck with victorian standards when it comes to things like that . 
  hell , maybe even further back . 
  edit : spelling , grammar etc. 
  ** i get it !, 
  they 've mistaken the capital of cyprus for a little town in sicily !, 
  jeez , that 's pretty bad . 
  that 's like mistaking the russian invasion of georgia for them invading the us state of georgia . 
  i do n't see the joke , but i 'm afraid to ask what it is for fear of appearing stupid . 
  nicosia is a place in sicily , is n't it ? 
  threats are pretty much the only thing the eu has . 
  which is a good thing . 
  not because i 'm anti-eu and wish it to be powerless ( i 'm not , as it turns out , although i am slightly wary of the whole thing ) . 
  to my knowledge ( which is n't much , so i could be wrong ) , the eu is the result of a ** massive ** peace project that started as france and germany deciding to share coal and steel . 
  the fact that it has no military to call its own ( although states in it have theirs ) and that they have to resort to reasons and / threats to convince others is a sign that that peace ideal is still going strong , right ? 
  i 'm not making sense , am i ? 
  i do n't know where i 'm going with this . 
  does your country have socialised healthcare ? 
  or freedom of speech / religion ? 
  because it 's not conservatives that pushes for things like that . 
  i 'd advise against painting everyone left of what you assume the political centre is as a ` fucking crook ' or what has ` poisoned europe ' . 
   oh so norway , sweden and switzerland did n't complain about the latest agreement ? 
  it was uk who said they want their `` protection '' and their own extra rights . 
  sweden signed it , and neither norway nor switzerland are part of the eu . 
  are you talking about the uk veto over the financial transaction tax ? 
  if so , you 're betraying your ignorance , since it was revealed that cameron was willing to sign it . 
  he just wanted ( quite rightly ) some compromise , since this tax would unfairly affect london . 
  but the petit caporal that is sarkozy insisted that he take it as is or leave it . 
  so cameron stuck to his guns , did what he said he would do and vetoed . 
  so yeah . 
  and people say ** we 're ** the 1984 country !, 
  people have a right to believe in something that is wrong . 
  it 's called religious fre - wait , no . 
   my proposal : stop your right wing , conservative attitude towards europe , and be a part of europe . 
  or , shut up , leave the eu and become america 's 51st state . 
  yeah , because that sort of shitty attitude is how you make friends . 
  obviously . 
  also , come back and say that once you 've said the same to norway , sweden and switzerland , because there is no reason for us to be singled out and be ordered to bend over like that . 
  never mind the fact that you 've somehow got it into your head that if it 's not brussels buttfucking us , then it must be america doing it . 
  yeah , right , pull the other one !, 
  french ? 
  moving here ? 
  well , we must be doing * something * right !, 
  at least 20 % cooler . 
  it 's still a terrible advert . 
  i mean , if it were showing a rag-tag bunch of mercenaries ( each one a stereotypical member of an eu country ) fighting back tonnes of chinese , indians and brazillians gi joe style , then it might have been good . 
  mais , non , we get this nonsense . 
  sure , let 's go with that . 
  and a cowboy hat and sunglasses combo ? 
  so , it starts with a white woman about to be beaten up by a bunch of ethnics . 
  and then there 's multiples of her . 
  and then they all sit down . 
  what . 
  the . 
  was . 
  that . 
  we do n't have an equivalent of the american dream in europe , because we 're all awake . 
  / lol so fahnny joke, 
  yeah , but you can still get a general idea of overall public opinion . 
  do the majority of people approve of him ? 
  disapprove him ? 
  does he get applause everywhere he goes ? 
  are they riots and protests outside his house ? 
  what ? 
  part of me just wants to say something like ` eh , the market will adapt ' and leave it at that , but i 'm curious . 
  is there an actual way to get lots of eggs , for affordable prices , to such high regulations ? 
  or is it more a ` choose two out of those three ' deal ? 
  i mean , i hear about how heavily farms are supposedly subsidised - i 'm not entirely sure what the means exactly so this view is probably quite ignorant - and i 'm thinking ` what are we doing wrong , if it 's so financially hard for our countries to grow food that our governments have to prop them up ? ', 
   what do you mean ? 
  that 's like ask you what do people in the uk think of cameron . 
  and what 's wrong with that question ? 
  ten points to romania !, 
  aah , right . 
  what do people in portugal think of him ? 
  in what eu country are the majority of prisons run privately ? 
  i know we 've got , like , one . 
  but everyone 's going on about how shitty it is . 
  who is that ? 
   health care , social services , waste management , water supply . 
  but ... these ones are public !, 
  sure there 's a private option for healthcare , but it 's not the only one . 
  so it 's sorta like the british governments e-petitions website , but for the whole of the european union ? 
  or does it just apply to those who are using the euro ? 
  either way , it 's an interesting idea .
