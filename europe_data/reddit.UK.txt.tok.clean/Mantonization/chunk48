  could be good . 
  i think the period of time known as the black death was a bigger , longer recession . 
  mate , believe me , you do n't want to talk about the irish like that . 
  hang on , according to this the echr ruling is that prisoners in prison for a stay of under four years can vote in prison !, 
  and lots of other countries have other restrictions !, 
  how come we 're the ones getting singled out ? 
   * because they were born free citizens of a modern democracy , where no man is better then anyone else . 
  * that does n't really sound like an answer . 
  it is because it is ? 
  we already give prisoners less rights than others while they 're incarcerated , do n't we ? 
  the very fact that prisons and prisoners exist attests to that . 
  that old joke ` we 've already established what you are , now we 're merely arguing over price ' comes to mind . 
  but you do make a very good point with the rest of your post , and i do acknowledge that that is an advantage of letting prisoners vote . 
  mainly , as a safeguard against possible government corruption / injustice . 
  that 's your rebuttal , is it ? 
  i 'm not advocating a right be taken away from them , i 'm asking why it should be given to them in the first place . 
  because i have n't really heard a good case for prisoners having a vote while in prison . 
   * and i do n't think that committing a crime means that you have `` opted out of the social contract '' . 
  * except that you have . 
  you 've rejected society in committing the crime , and are being removed from society because of it . 
  that 's the entire point of the prison system . 
   * and simple incarceration does n't `` reform '' anyone * i 'm not implying that the simple act of being locked up reforms someone . 
  but reformation happens during the process , if the countries prison system is good enough . 
   * the right to vote is unrelated to any offense/crime you may have committed * again , they 've opted out of the social contract . 
  that 's what prison is ** for ** . 
  we say to them ` you 've broken societies laws , so we 're going to remove you from society and its freedoms , make you see the error of your ways , then let you out ' . 
  if you let them have every freedom inside that they have outside , then what 's the point of prison at all ? 
   * incarcerated person still has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion . 
  * that 's a different thing entirely , because that does n't affect anyone on the outside . 
  them voting does . 
  call me a cynic , but something tells me that people in prison are n't going to base their voting decisions on anything other than ` who will let me out faster ', 
   but the brits think it 's ok take away such a fundamental right from prisoners as the right to vote ? 
  why should prisoners have the right to vote ? 
  genuinely curious why you 'd think that . 
  how is it a fundamental right of ** prisoners ** , of all people ? 
  to clarify , i mean prisoners that are in prison . 
  the whole ** point ** of prison is taking someone who has opted out of the social contract through crime , and removing them from that society until they 've reformed . 
  why should they have a right to affect a world they 're no longer part of during their incarceration ? 
  once they 're out , sure , but during ? 
  besides , it 'd create a weird situation of politicians pandering to a prisoner voter base . 
  they 'd just vote for whoever promises to let them out earlier . 
  ** edit : yeah , downvote me because you do n't agree with what i 'm saying . 
  that 's totally what that feature 's for . 
  it 's not for hiding things that are n't related to the subject matter or anything , honest . 
  ** ** i 'm asking questions to try and understand the other point of view , because i 'll be honest , i 'm quite ignorant on the subject and it 's very possible that i might change my mind . 
  downvoting me because i do n't just agree out of hand is ridiculous . 
  `` no , shut up , deal with it or piss off . 
  also nazis . '', 
  whatever you say chief . 
  `` just try and stop us '', 
  yeah , venice was a total slutfest . 
  see ? 
  it 's shit like that . 
  i think it 's the same reason hollywood is pushing for sopa and acta . 
  they refuses to change to market forces outside their control ( piracy / cuba giving a better service , in this case ) so they decide to just try and change the world instead . 
  which is ridiculous . 
  there 's a reason for making the original copy physical and signed though , which is accountability . 
  not really . 
  the vast majority of us would n't dream of changing the queen and prime ministers for a president . 
   and let 's not forget that it is us policy to pry open markets around the world , often with the help of the imf and world bank . 
  well , i suppose bombing middle-eastern countries and handing their oil over to private companies is ` prying open markets ' . 
  oh , and america also got a long track record of being a dick . 
  overthrowing democratic governments in the last century , etc. 
  have you seen the documentary sicko ? 
  it has a few inconsistencies ( since it 's a michael moore film , let 's be honest ) but at the end he takes all the us people he talked to to cuba . 
  they all get free treatment , and one woman starts sobbing because the pills she was spending hundreds on a week back home , that were financially crippling her but she needed , were sold for about 30 american cents . 
  i wonder if medical care in america compared to cuba has something to do with it . 
   it will have great strategic value in the reconquest of the puny british isles . 
  them 's fightin ' words , boy !, 
  do n't take my word for it !, 
  we have a tonne of experts confirming this !, 
  ** german ** experts !, 
  look how scientific they are !, 
  our other top story : water is found to be wet , and fire is found to be hot . 
  more details on these ground breaking discoveries at eleven . 
  well , i hope you kept the receipt . 
   four lions oh man , i love that film !, 
  yeah , they 're sympathetic , but they 're still portrayed as either dumbasses or hypocrites . 
  which is good , really . 
  because let 's be honest , best way to defeat terrorism is to take the piss out of it . 
   bought on the street you brought it on yourself , to be honest . 
  some comments / articles say otherwise , but thanks . 
  do we count as european for this topic ? 
  if so , i 'd happily recommend * shaun of the dead * and * hot fuzz * . 
  they 're both hilarious films . 
  too many times . 
  i think we should start handcuffing the briefcases to their wrists . 
  and make the key be taken to the destination separately . 
  they finally started selling dvds of * troll hunter * in hmv . 
  i snapped that baby right up . 
  if they 're not going to do anything to combat growing aviation emissions , then we will . 
  and if they do n't like it , then they can piss off . 
   and , last , but not least , do you really think people who are being completely serious quote yes , minister ? 
  i 've actually seen some people do that , yes . 
  they 've usually overheard it , and not knowing its source thought it sounded good . 
  regardless , i knew you were joking . 
  i was just trying to explain why others might be downvoting you . 
  because your edit suggested that you did n't quite understand why . 
  i 'm just going to clear things up for you barsoap . 
  to take the piss successfully , you need to - do it between friends - use the correct tone of voice you unfortunately fail on the first one , because ( i assume ) most brits do n't know you well enough to tell when you 're joking .
