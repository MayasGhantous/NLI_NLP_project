  this is n't helped by your failure on the second part , since you 're communicating in a text-only medium and thus you need to specifically point out your tone of voice to not have your message taken at face value by many people . 
  a simple / joke would have sufficed . 
  because of this problem , your edit seems very condescending as well . 
  one might go as far as to say butthurt . 
  finally , there 's a difference between someone taking the piss out of something that is theirs , and taking the piss out of something that is someone else 's . 
  if it 's not yours , do n't automatically assume you can do it . 
  it 's like how parents can call their children every name under the sun , but will get defensive if someone else says the same about their kids . 
  i am . 
  the syrians are asking for our help , and the syrian government is slaughtering its own people . 
  it 's the exact same reasons we helped libya , we should help syria too . 
  we voted to actually do something !, 
  we actually do care !, 
  if you want to point the finger , point it at china or russia for vetoing the un decision on intervening !, 
  presumably . 
  angst angst angst angst angst . 
  look , buddy , the world 's full of problems . 
  but just complaining will fix nothing . 
  so why do n't you come down from that cross , use the wood to build a bridge , and then ** get over it ** . 
  i cheered when i saw the banana !, 
  seriously though , what 's wrong with the current flag ? 
  other flags are older , and they do n't seem to be any less relevant to their respective countries . 
  yes , well , they would say that would n't they ? 
  they 're the ones pushing for it . 
  you want some cheese for that whine ? 
  what the hell is your problem ? 
  why are you turning this into an attack on my country ? 
  you jerk . 
  well , i enjoy the sentiment at least . 
  if there 's something the eu could always have , it 's better pr . 
  did you know that ( in this country at least , not sure about germany ) you can get put on the sex offenders register for urinating in public ? 
  it 's far easier to get on the list than you realise . 
  i expect the reason behind the urge to end surgical castration is the same reason we do n't have the death penalty : because it 's an irreversible thing , and the courts decision can be wrong . 
  so small ? 
  have you been hiding something from us lithuania ? 
  shall we agree to disagree ? 
  i 'll be honest with you , i was making a joke . 
  `` socialism never took root in america because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires . '', 
  this line can be used explain why the economic and welfare status in america is so fucked up . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wwqa7waqye ), 
   my nephews , 12 and 15 year old think that charles de gaulle is an airport , and has nothing to do with wwii . 
  pretty sad that is quite sad . 
  but then again , the airport is the only thing with that name that 's done any good , so ... 
   english are ... germans what ? 
  we were so careful !, 
  can i just say thank you actually accepting that america went to the moon ? 
  according to qi a full 25 % of brits do n't think so . 
  which is depressing . 
  [ haha !, 
  a bunch of countries led by america and china , trying to find ways to push the eu around and get out of losing a drop of their oceans of money . 
  screw 'em all , i say . 
  just what are you implying ? 
  i want to say something witty , but i ca n't . 
  i just ca n't . 
  just , ** fuck it ** . 
  i think this drone rush is a good thing . 
  not only is relying on local ( well , local as in european ) technology good for economic , technological and security reasons , it also means we can get a leg up ahead of the others . 
  because let 's be honest , we 're kinda underpowered at the moment . 
  we ca n't hope to beat the brute force armoured assaults of america or the cheap zerg rushes of china . 
  we need to be the flexible , technologically advanced faction to stand a chance . 
  at least we have good tiberium deposi - wait , no . 
  sorry , ignore that last bit . 
  upvotes for you . 
  false alarm people !, 
  funnily enough , typing ` what has europe ever done for us ' into google gives you a website with a parody of this very bit . 
  http://www.whathaseuropedone.eu/ unfortunately the animation is mind-numbingly awful , and it falls flat when they try and replace things like ` the aqueduct ' with ` cheaper flights ' . 
  because ** obviously ** the equivalent to a vast engineering project bringing clean water to millions is being able to fly for a few pounds cheaper . 
  ** clearly **, 
  well , the point still stands . 
  knowing other places in poland , or how to speak polish , might be a start . 
  research , research , research . 
  of course . 
  you would n't put up with someone talking foul of your kids , would you ? 
  no matter how you speak about them yourself ? 
   another , related reason is that if they had n't have invented their own , private game they 'd have to play the commonwealth rugby teams and be utterly destroyed . 
  that hurts barsoap . 
  that hurts real bad . 
  good analogy . 
  even if technically false . 
  it 's all about moving money around . 
  it likes to get out there and make friends , not sit still . 
  it 's how you turn riches to wealth . 
  i bet he 'll want to move somewhere warmer after that !, 
   american here -- would be happy to answer any specific questions you have regarding gridiron football . 
  my two ( obligatory ) questions : - it 's not a sphere , and you do n't use your foot except a few rare occasions . 
  should n't it be called handegg ? 
  - why is it like rugby , but with armour on and you have to take a break every thirty seconds ? 
  do n't talk shit about the royals !, 
  since the vatican is a nation in its own right ... could n't we invade it ? 
  i mean , they 're harbouring international criminals with their sheltering of paedophile priests . 
  and they 've done some pretty atrocious things in their history . 
  we could probably find a cause for invasion there . 
  hell , if they were browner ( or had oil in the catacombs ) america would have done it already !, 
   ( i feel like an imbecile right now \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ) easy mistake to make , the flags are just one colour apart . 
  at a glance you can mistake one for the other . 
  ( that 's pretty much the only similarity between the two though . 
  because one country 's said to be full of life-sucking vampires ... and the others romania ), 
  ** merkel with colour !, 
  kill it !, 
   so , we 've decommissioned of all our aircraft carriers we 're building new ones . 
  we 've decided to cut our losses and go for new , more efficient stuff .
