   disposed of our harrier jump-jets as a general all-around aircraft they 're not that great nowadays . 
  their radar signature is atrocious for example . 
  if only you knew the power of the dark side . 
  germany , it is your destiny . 
  join us , and we can ~ ~ kick the shit out of france ~ ~ rule europe ** together ** !, 
  and i suppose that if you 're given longer , you 'll take the extra-scenic route through poland ? 
  will you be delivering them straight through france , or taking the more scenic route through belgium ? 
  they just had to mention the war , did n't they ? 
  i suppose the temptation is just too large with a story like this . 
  the sale of ashchurch is sad , and ( i feel ) could prove to be a bad move in the long run . 
  the whole ` i 'll sell this , then buy another one when i have more money ' idea might not turn out well when the item in question is a huge piece of land used for military vehicles . 
  apart from that though , i suppose i have no real complaints . 
  needs must after all , and i have complete faith that they 'll be kept secure and well looked after in germany . 
  especially the challengers . 
  marvellous machines , they . 
  ` sth ' ? 
  both are bad , since both can lead to population problems . 
  we should reward ** sustainable ** population growth . 
  try and keep the birth / death scales balanced , instead of rewarding one side being heavier than the other . 
  side note : i 'm glad to see the bombing of dresden is remembered , because we seriously , ** seriously ** screwed up there . 
  the bombing was n't even really ** for ** anything . 
  the railway was targeted , but the whole operation was just to show germany how deeply we could bomb them . 
  there was probably a bit of vengeance for places like coventry mixed in too . 
  regardless of the reasons , it ended up with a raging firestorm , massive civilian deaths ( the majority from sudden loss of oxygen i believe ) and ... the railway unharmed and running the next day . 
  do n't think of it as giving up . 
  just think of it as ... putting it on hold . 
  indefinitely . 
  i 'd really love to see an eu flag on the moon . 
  i mean , sure the whole premise has been done before , but it 'd be a huge milestone for the union . 
  ca n't we do both ? 
  i was n't aware that one you were in the eu clubhouse the door was locked behind you and you were forbidden from going outside . 
  nice !, 
  how much of an energy increase is it expected to supply ? 
  i suggest nuclear power . 
  much cleaner , cheaper and safer than oil or gas , and more practical ( for the moment ) than solar or other renewable sources . 
  probably less of a blight on the landscape than wind turbines too . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/durendal short version : holy sword containing the remains of several saints , delivered to charlemagne via angel . 
  gave it to his right hand paladin roland , who died holding back thousands of muslims at what is now la br\u00e8che de roland while the french retreated . 
  so it would n't fall into enemy hands , he threw it at the cliff in rocamadour ( which is practically half a country away but never mind ) , where it 's still embedded to this day . 
  or at least , that 's how the legend goes . 
  but it was n't long after the sword was lost that charlemagne 's dream of a united europe crumpled . 
  i do n't think so !, 
  funny how they include charlemagne , but do n't include durendal . 
  because , come on , everyone knows europe will never truly be united until the legendary holy sword of charlemagne is taken from its resting place at rocamadour and reforged . 
  obviously . 
  bad show , old boy . 
  bad show . 
  i wish i could just dismiss your theory out of hand as crazy . 
  but you 're probably right . 
   publishers call for calm and reasoned assessment they should practice what they preach . 
  if they did , acta would n't even be a thing . 
  i 'm not blaming the french government , i 'm blaming the article . 
  what we need is a good war to bring us all together . 
  maybe an alien invasion . 
  or failing that , russia or america . 
  / a joke . 
  mostly . 
  first thing this article shows me is a picture of haiti and the caption  the financial transactions tax could be used for helping poor countries why do n't you use it to , you know , help europe ? 
  besides , throwing money at third world countries never works . 
  i ca n't bring myself to go on about the ftt this time . 
  i 'm just annoyed that the first thing i see is a suggestion equivalent to throwing all the hypothetical money in a big pit and burning it . 
  i 've heard their small is our large . 
  this article is nonsense . 
  all it says is that uk kids eat more sweets than america kids , and conclude from that that uk kids must be twice as fat . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  dammit , where 's that polandball comic when you need it ... 
  okay , this is getting silly now . 
  for a start , just because something is unpopular does not mean it 's illegal . 
  second , i understand how horrible it must be to constantly bear the brunt of your peoples frustration . 
  but deciding to follow suit and take out your frustrations on the next level up helps no one . 
  yeah ~ ~ greece ~ ~ dimokratia , go ahead . 
  do that . 
  / not enough sarcasm in the world for this comment * edit : i was n't trying to imply that this newspaper is representative of greece as a whole , i was just being facetious . 
  apologies for any offense caused *, 
  you 've got to admire their ingenuity . 
  the clever sods . 
  i bet it 's because they got careless and started throwing their money around that the government were tipped off . 
  that 's how it always seems to happen . 
  would be okay to use drones the same way we use , say , police helicopters ? 
  it seems a logical progression of technology . 
  one could argue that if greece leaves the eurozone , the eurozone will be stronger for it , and can then come back to help greece later . 
  not that that 's what i think . 
  i understand the vegetarianism for reasons of health and such , but you do n't like the taste of meat ? 
  i 'm not really sure what to say . 
  it 's like you 're missing limbs or something . 
  i would n't say that . 
  i ca n't get enough of polish kabanosy . 
  i honestly do n't have anything to offer in way of an explanation . 
  is food not as good in america ? 
  i 'm surprised . 
  i mean , i knew your hershey 's chocolate bars suck and literally taste like sour vomit , but all your meat and vegetables too ? 
  you see [ this ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/toad_in_the_hole.jpg ) this is toad in the hole . 
  it is sausages suspended in yorkshire pudding batter . 
  often served with vegetables , potatoes ( mashed and / or roasted ) and onion gravy . 
  it 's not that great for a summer dish , since it 's a hot , heavy meal . 
  but when you 've come in from the cold or the rain , perhaps after a hard days work or from a walk in the woods , it 's the best thing you 'll ever taste . 
   but the temptation to use an uav to , say , track a given license plate just so we know where bob is , e.g. 
  for speeding enforcement , is a scary thought . 
  how is it scarier than , say , a policeman parked by the side of the road with a speedometer , hoping to catch and give out tickets ?
