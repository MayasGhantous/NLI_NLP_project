  what is it about it being a ugv / uav controlled from the station that strikes fear into you ? 
   automobile traffic monitoring what 's the problem with that ? 
  instead of a helicopter hovering overhead giving traffic news to radio stations , it 's a uav hovering overhead . 
  sounds like a natural progression to me . 
  while i admire the sentiment ( and the technology used , i love uavs and the like ) ` cheaper and more advanced ' does n't always mean ` better ' . 
  as it 's been said in the article , aerial views will only get you so far , and they are easily confused or fooled . 
  a mixture of both satellites / drones and inspectors might be best . 
  but then again , that would cost more , not less . 
  a lot of his doings as the president of france are embarrassing . 
  not that my country is squeaky clean either , but ` nobody 's perfect ' goes without saying really . 
  i 'm not suggesting that she endorse cameron instead of sarkozy . 
  at all . 
  do n't be silly . 
  i just do n't think she should endorse sarkozy . 
  went to check the comments section for dumb posts to laugh at . 
  was sorely disappointed . 
  oh come on merkel !, 
  do n't campaign for sarkozy !, 
  please ? 
  not only is it unprofessional of you as chancellor of pretty much the best-off country in europe to endorse him , but it 's ** sarkozy ** !, 
  it 's not fit for the job . 
  well , we are in a long cold winter ... 
  do n't be like that . 
  it 's not a case of people taking the daily mail as a serious news source . 
  people just like their two minute hate . 
  or to be more accurate , their 45 minute sputtering of rage over breakfast . 
  whatever dangers there are in establishing fairness through law , doing nothing is even worse . 
  as countries all over the world ( the latest big example being america ) have shown , putting no laws in place and assume everyone will be moral and fair ** does not work ** . 
  people are ** dicks ** , and ** will ** abuse their power if they think they can get away with it . 
  yes , but we were made an even bigger one . 
  from ` we should probably bomb those guys ' to ` yeah , we 're definitely gon na bomb these guys ' regardless , we were n't an allied country . 
  we were america 's ` unsinkable aircraft carrier ' . 
  you say that , but because of the yanks and their early warning system that we ended up putting in our country , not only did we become a bigger nuclear target , but while the americans got a 30 minute warning out of it , we only got 4 . 
  ** four goddamn minutes . 
  ** we were n't friends . 
  we were a human shield . 
  i 'm not sure what this article is trying to say . 
  she seems to be crooning on about how wonderful capitalism is , and how foolish people apparently are for wanting a fairer system ? 
  i imagine that many germans do n't like the idea of being a pit stop or method of power projection for america ? 
  good point , good point . 
  well then !, 
  fantastic news !, 
  the bit about us meddling is disappointing , although truth be told not unexpected . 
  they 're proving themselves to be less and less of our friends seemingly every day . 
   because lets be honest here , if scotland could do that to the rest of the uk , they would . 
  salmond is doing something like that , in a way . 
  think about it . 
  he 's diametrically opposed to the tory party . 
  one of the things he 's using to get scotland out of the uk is the current tory government in power , as well as call-backs to the tories of thatcher 's day . 
  but scotland is a ** huge ** labour power base , and acts as a counterweight to tory influence in britain from england . 
  by leaving the union , he 'll increase tory influence by a huge degree , thus throwing everyone who is n't north of the border under a political bus . 
  or to put it in more political cartoon terms - if scotland , england , wales and n. ireland are all men running away from tory wolves , scotland is the man tripping the others up , in the hope that the wolves will devour his comrades and he will escape . 
   the circumvention of public votes was a necessary evil was it ? 
  i 'd like to see you try explain how that 's the case . 
  and who is currently doing the best out of the eu , and is at the top of the pile ? 
  that would be ... ooh , fancy that !, 
  germany !, 
  all of these freeze frames are certainly cool to look at , but since a lot of people have died of the cold the whole thing is rather chilling . 
  not to mention how many plans it must be putting on ice . 
  define ` artificial ', 
  i wonder why salmond and co hate britain ? 
  as an englishman , english people who say ` english people annoy me ' annoy me . 
  ** that 's even worse !, 
  amen to that !, 
  it 's too late for apologies , you coward . 
  * jebi se * . 
  if you do not believe something is right , ** you do not sign it ** . 
  signing it then apologising helps no one . 
  i wonder if a decade or so into the future , the eu and the us will have a war ? 
  it 'd be interesting to say the least . 
  probably end in a stalemate too , if the eu is on its own and america 's military / economic situation does n't worsen . 
  [ good on them ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ufmvo5lu58 ), 
  this anti-french attitude that seems to have bloomed since the iraq war is extremely worrying . 
  and also kind of funny , considering it 's because of france an independent america even exists . 
  but no matter how funny it is , a mad man jostling for position that includes a big red ` launch 9600 nuclear missiles ' button is a serious cause for concern . 
   but , she adds , many inhabitants of eu nations will be surprised to learn that they are living under socialism . 
  my head immediately provides the picture of a stereotypical american tourist , yelling at some bemused germans ` what do you mean , you 're not living under a facist-communist-nanny-police state dominated by muslims ? 
  of course you are !, 
  why are you so surprised ?! ', 
  i get this bile-raising sense of ` we know what your lives are like , you do n't ' false-superiority from it , even if it 's not intended . 
  clearly you 've never been to romania . 
  obvious troll is obvious ? 
  why should she ? 
  i do n't think a countries elections should be influenced in such a way . 
  can you think of a better acronym ? 
  giips ? 
  ipigs ? 
  i 'm surprised and delighted to find out we 're not alone in this . 
  regardless , we 'll just have to see whether the fiscal treaty works or not . 
  if it does - great !, 
  we 'll probably end up following suit , since our fears will be assuaged . 
  if it does n't ... well , there 'll probably be large crowds on the cliffs of dover , singing ` neener neener neener , told you so ' across the channel . 
   this is another stupid and pointless attempt at it that will only drive out investors i 'll be brutally honest , i was sort of hoping for that . 
  i 've stuck with the whole ` financial transactions tax is bad ' thing , and i 'd like to see the conclusion . 
  besides , i 'm hoping that sarko will lose the next election , and this will probably lose him a lot of support if it does n't turn out well . 
  i 'm actually very impressed that sarkozy has done this . 
  it 's very brave of him , to offer up france as the guinea pig for this sort of tax . 
  if all goes well , europe says ` told you so ' to britain , britain says ` fair enough ' and joins everyone else in following suit . 
  if all goes poorly , britain says ` told you so ' to europe , europe says ` fair enough ' and we all get back to trying to work out a solution . 
  it 's practically a win-win .
