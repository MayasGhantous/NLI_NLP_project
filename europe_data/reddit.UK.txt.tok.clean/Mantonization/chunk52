  except for france , that is . 
  the article does seem correct , in that greece 's decision on a budget commissioner will have long lasting political effects . 
  it also seems that some people are beginning to see the eu and germany as one and the same . 
  that 's probably not good . 
  [ obligatory ] ( http://img2.moonbuggy.org/imgstore/howard-djs-like-a-mad-cunt.jpg ), 
  shoop a pair of hands around camerons / sarkozys necks . 
  she 's using force choke on them during a conference call . 
  good question . 
  to be honest i 'm not entirely sure . 
  perhaps if instead of one person at the top , power wise , it 's a council of people ? 
  like how in britain , while the prime minister is technically at the top , it 's parliament that holds all the power . 
  there 's seems to be some resentment , yes . 
  as i understand , it comes from the view that the scots have everything better than england ( cheaper uni fees , better healthcare , etc ) because of england , and they have more control over our country than we on theirs ( west lothian question , etc ) , and yet they still bitch and whine and moan about how big bad england is n't being good to them . 
  that 's the thing with opinion pieces . 
  occasionally you get really stupid ones . 
  fair enough . 
  let me try again : i think more integration is the way to go , if only because it gives us more political clout against possible threats ( us , brics , etc ) but i think that we should do that ` bottom up ' model that others are suggesting . 
  more democracy , not less . 
  we need to keep it as a union of countries , not one big country with one person at the top . 
   so the party the scottish people voted in should have the say on when they set the referendum of course they bloody do . 
  cameron is n't ** forcing ** anyone to do anything . 
  he ** is ** however pushing for it to be a year early , for the reasons i 've said above . 
   cameron is basically saying , fuck that , have it now cuz i know it 'll fail . 
  so you think it 'll fail if it is n't in 2014 and is instead in 2013 ? 
  why do you think that ? 
   i 'm just saying cameron saying that the referendum has to be 2 questions instead of the promised 3 , and has to be sooner rather than later is not a way to win voters in scotland who are already angry with a conservative government . 
  oh , i 'm sorry , i was n't aware that people are n't allowed to be politically against anything scotland does . 
  your complaint seems to be purely based around the fact that cameron is n't just letting salmond do whatever the hell he likes . 
  the bbc is n't a newspaper , nor has it ever called the eu the 4th reich . 
  and the acronym is p.i.i.g.s. 
  standing for portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain . 
  there 's no malevolence in it , it 's just a catchy acronym . 
  come on now , try to get your facts right . 
  that 's the problem with being at the top , * mein freund * . 
  we just ca n't fucking win , can we ? 
  what kind of bloody insane logic is that ? 
  `` grrr i 'm mad because they 're giving me what i want too early , the bastards ! '' ? 
  cameron did not try to force them to do anything . 
  he pushed for a referendum earlier because he knows that 2014 is an anniversary year for several scottish historical events , which is why salmond wants it that year . 
  he 's hoping that jingoistic fervour will win him the day , rather than reason . 
  leave serbia alone !, 
  besides , while we ** did ** invent the concentration camp during the boer war , we did ** not ** trying to ethnically cleanse them . 
  that clear ? 
  i 'm surprised that waterpolo is still allowed . 
  the number of drowned horses each match is hideous . 
  well , more democracy is always good . 
  so is actually punishing countries that break the rules . 
  i 've nothing to say on the currency ( since i 'm not an economist ) apart from the fact that i find the design horrible . 
  it 's sterile , impersonal , and just does n't feel like real money . 
  it feels like , i dunno , monopoly money . 
  and for god sake , has ** bridges ** on it . 
  seriously ? 
  we have ** darwin ** on ours , and you want us to replace that with ** bridges ? 
  ** a cut back on the britain bashing might be nice . 
  it 's dangerously cult-like how anything we do or say that is n't kissing the eus arse is immediately shouted down , with calls for britain to leave the eu , etc. 
  i 'm still annoyed about the * petit caporal * sarkozy telling cameron to shut up . 
  end of the day : i like the idea behind the eu , and i wish to be a part of it as it continues . 
  however , i do n't want my life run by it . 
  i 'm very uneasy behind that idea . 
  edit : what , did i say something wrong ? 
  not toeing the party line enough ? 
  do you not think that if we 'd got into the eu a good few decades earlier than we did , we would not be more integrated than we are now ? 
   please do n't quote british newspapers as your source , as they always wage a rhetorical war against germany . 
  especially bbc . 
  i understand this is probably very irrelevant , but : why a gorilla ? 
  that would be hilarious . 
  what animal would that be though ? 
  some kind of bird ? 
  a beached whale perhaps ? 
  case in point : question 3 : * i look upon european summits : * * - as a crowning achievement of multicultural , multilingual cooperation * * - as a waste of time and money * * - as people rearranging the deckchairs on the titanic * * - through a ski-mask , just before attempting a black run * what the hell is this ? 
  my only choices are ` best thing ever omg ' , ` useless ' , ` useless ' , and ` skiing lol ' ? 
  all the other articles and such have been pretty good , but this quiz is just shameful . 
  also , i do n't want cameron 's face taking up a good third of my screen thanks . 
  i 'll play along for the sake of argument : only the ones who have broken the rules though , surely ? 
  and only in the areas that they not toed the line in ? 
  you should n't replace a countries finance minister if they 're breaking agricultural eu laws , for example . 
  well , yes and no . 
  on the one hand , no because it 's still a logical fallacy to not look at the evidence and instead base whether something is true or not on who is presenting it . 
  but on the other hand , yes because looking at the telegraph 's past shows that it has an anti-eu bias . 
  and because the telegraph ** is n't a goddamn country ** , full of people an newspapers with differing ideas . 
  aaaand now we 're back to square one , with fforw pointing out that , apparently , things like not liking the fact that you 're reproached because of what your ancestors did makes you an anti-semite . 
  ( which for the record , ** is ** a ridiculous criterion for anti-semitism ), 
  the falsehood of that statement aside : seriously ? 
  you could have said ` wholly german empire ' and gone with a clever historical pun . 
  but no , you had to go with nazis . 
  you philistine . 
   well , sucks to be us , i guess . 
  those before germany should have been more thorough . 
  do n't fret . 
  maybe someone else will try , and take the heat off you . 
   if my house burns down because someone set it on fire , i blame the arsonist , not the fire fighters . 
  i still want the fire fighters to keep doing their job . 
  if you want the fire fighters to do their job , then you will blame them if they fail to put out their house . 
  my point still stands . 
  if you want germany to be responsible for stopping anti-semitism worldwide , then you must also want them to be held responsible when anti-semitism does n't drop , or increases somewhere . 
   i do n't expect more , it just needs to continue . 
  who said it was n't going to continue ? 
  you 're arguing for something that 's happening anyway . 
  talk about redundant !, 
   `` a lot of people tried killing that guy , just because i at least got him in a wheel-chair now does n't mean i should be responsible for anything ! '',
