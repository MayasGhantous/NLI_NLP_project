  it 's more like ` lots of guys have tried killing that guy , but he 's only going after the latest one , rather than all of them '  i did n't say we should take the flack for what others do . 
  yes you did . 
  by saying that they should be responsible for ` the decline or even disappearance of anti-semitism ' ( sic ) you are also saying that they should be held responsible for when that does n't happen , or when anti-semitism actually worsens somewhere in the world . 
  if it 's a man 's responsibility to put out fires , you blame him when your house burns down , since he failed to fulfil his responsibility in extinguishing the flames . 
   i suggested working towards israel 's acceptance in the world , by influencing israel to be more likeable or its neighbours to finally accept it what , do you think they 're not one of the countries pressing for some kind of peace process ? 
  there 's not really much else they can do . 
  what , hated for generations ? 
  remembered as a villain ? 
  likely to be bombed ? 
  the majority of countrymen waiting for him to die so they can party ? 
  ` x 's margaret thatcher ' is n't meant to be a compliment . 
  i do n't need to have an idea of my own to know when someone else 's idea is bad . 
  i do n't need to be a master tailor to know the emperor has no clothes . 
  besides , germany is hardly the first country who tried to kill / exile its jewish population . 
  hell , we tried a few times during the middle ages . 
  making germany take the flack for what others do , even though they have no control over those others , is ridiculous . 
  germany has ** zero ** control over the arab world and their thoughts . 
  so germans are no longer reproached and blamed when ... the arabs and jews stop trying to kill each other ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm not sure you 've thought this through . 
  edit : oh , also . 
  if you have n't signed the contract , or even seen it , then how can it be valid ? 
  i do n't think there 's a metaphorical court in existence that would try enforce such a contract . 
  referring to your first point , when does the mortgage end ? 
  it has to end ** sometime ** . 
  the alternative , saying that all germans until the end of time should be blamed for the events of 1939 - 1945 , is clearly ludicrous . 
  quisling and such , yes ? 
  i believe that after the war norway reintroduced the death penalty , killed him , then abolished it again . 
  all nice and legal . 
  i 'd advise against dismissing something out of hand just because it comes from the uk . 
  it 's bad logic . 
  i think this disagreement between us and europe would n't be happening ( or at least , would n't be so large ) if de gaulle had n't been an arse and vetoed our first two attempts to join the eu . 
  we 'd probably be on much friendlier terms . 
  aah well . 
  aah , well then . 
  that changes things . 
  i 'm not talking about chickening out and pretending it never happened . 
  it 's like , if you wrong a friend , do you have to apologise for what you did every time you see them until the day you both die ? 
  no , eventually you reach a point where your apology is accepted , and while you 're not forgetting it happened , you just do n't bring it up anymore . 
  obviously there 's a ** huge ** difference between wronging a friend and , you know , ** genocide ** , but you get what i 'm trying to say , yes ? 
  for curiosities sake , is there a certain number of years to go until governments have to stop publicly apologising for ww2 ? 
  like how people were saying that 9/11 - while still a horrible thing - would stop being such a huge , untouchable deal after the ten year mark . 
  is it ten years for terrorism , a hundred years for war crimes ? 
  baby boomers and such . 
  `` okay we have an incredibly incompetent , cowardly captain , but ** holocaust holocaust holocaust nazis death camps ovens neener neener neener ** '' . 
  it 's not called ` the torygraph ' for nothing . 
  i imagine that it 's quite easy for norway , since their population is less than that of london . 
  neither is socialist . 
  mccarthy has a lot to answer for , i feel . 
   official ultimatum on the uk on where they stand , enough of this blatant hypocrisy . 
  either 100 % european union with our currency and everything or get out . 
  this comment ** itself ** is hypocrisy . 
  no other country is demanded to be 100 % in the eu , or forced to choose between being 100 % in or not , why should the uk be ? 
   solidarity among eu countries to generally reinforce the union as well as our mutual feelings ( enough with the past it 's 2012 already ) . 
  so you want us all to be friends ? 
  after your previous point ? 
  i speak from the bottom of my heart when i say : ** go fuck yourself , you hypocritical italian bastard . 
  ** i do n't care if i get downvoted to oblivion . 
  i 'm calling you out on your britain bashing bs . 
  same . 
  in my opinion , countries are rated not how they treat their highest , but how they treat their lowest . 
  a country where the average man can die of easily treatable diseases / injuries because he has no insurance ; where you have to choose between not reattaching a limb or going bankrupt and losing your house ; where your insurance can refuse to pay for your cancer treatment because ` it 's a pre-existing condition ' ; is ** not ** a first world country . 
  which ( as much as it pains me to say it ) is why people have a point when they say that the eu needs to exist for reasons of political strength . 
  eventually , we 're gon na need to come together and say no . 
  even if that only means one country giving them the finger , and the rest of europe going ` we got your back ', 
  actually , if i hear republicans bash something , it usually means it 's a good thing . 
  but i do get annoyed if average americans start to think ridiculous things . 
  like we 're all commies , or we 're all poor , or we live in police states , or we 're overrun with muslims , etc etc. 
  i hope they 're prepared to pay royalties if they want to put shakespeare on euros . 
  but then again , anything 's better than bridges . 
  ( in case linkov is reading this , that first line was a joke ), 
  i do n't know about you , but i do n't want to have my office be a floating wood and glass box suspended over thing air . 
  you ca n't fire me , i quit !, 
  welp , there goes europe 's moral high ground !, 
  totally did n't see ** this ** coming !, 
  you 're a bit late . 
  this is the problem with the march of technology - leaders have to keep up , or be left in the dust and look foolish . 
  or , you know , act draconian because they do n't get how things work . 
  sopa , etc. 
  you make a good point . 
  although as you said , it is speculation . 
  the problem is that the economist is n't in the public eye as much as the grauniad . 
  look on the bright side . 
  at least it 's not the torygraph doing it . 
  fair enough . 
  give the bbc ** some ** credit . 
  they 're legally obligated to be as neutral and accurate as possible . 
  unlike the gutter press . 
  edit : besides , it 's not like we actually believe that all germans are nazis . 
  the humour being ` politicians are all lying bastards and not to be trusted ' . 
  bit of an old joke , i know , but it 's never stopped being a relevant one . 
   is it leech like to want to support one 's family ? 
  if they 're working for their money , surely there 's no problem ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with supporting ones family . 
  and i agree that leech would have been a better term if it was about welfare , but at the end of the day it 's still money being taken out of the british economy and sent to be circulated elsewhere . 
  you 're right , i am judgemental . 
  they were working in our country , taking money out of our economy and sending it back home to theirs . 
  --  the joke . 
  --  your head but while we 're on the subject , a politician does n't really the first of those definitions either . 
  a politician , a credible source ?
