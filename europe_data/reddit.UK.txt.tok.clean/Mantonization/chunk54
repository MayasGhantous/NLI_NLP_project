  what ** are ** you talking about ? 
  it seems that in britain , most of you have already packed up and left . 
  the ones who were just sending all their money home , leech like , have departed , and we 're left with the ones who want to stay . 
  which is nice , because the polish are good people . 
  edit : perhaps leech is n't the right word , but i 'm getting the point across , yes ? 
  i 've seen a pro-eu website that tried to make one . 
  it was awful . 
  the animation made me want to vomit , and instead of something revolutionary like the aqueduct being suggested first , it was ` cheaper flights ' . 
  because ** obviously ** that 's the equivalent of a vast engineering project bringing better infrastructure to millions . 
  edit : if you want to see it , it 's here : [ http://www.whathaseuropedone.eu/] ( http://www.whathaseuropedone.eu/ ) i advise against it though . 
   what is arguably the most important legislative and economic entity in our daily lives you 'd be hard pressed to argue that . 
  good . 
  the eu has the worst pr possible in britain . 
  if it 's ever going to be accepted it needs things like this . 
  in before france does another continental embargo of british produce . 
  be much easier to make greece into new south germany . 
   she 's a woman , and he 's a man . 
  she leads an impossible coalition , while he is the king of france . 
  together they fight crime ? 
  in other news : crocodiles say they 're harmless , invite children to swim with them . 
  it 's p.i.i.g.s. 
  it 's not an insult , it 's just an acronym for portugal , italy , ireland , greece and spain . 
  you know this !, 
  if you can make a better acronym than that , i shall use it . 
  but until then . 
  being balanced does not mean saying that 2 + 3 = 6 is as valid an answer as 2 + 3 = 5, 
   to read the entire article , you must be a time subscriber nuh uh , screw that . 
  do n't worry , it gets easier . 
  just assume everything we say or do has a subtext of humour , and you 'll be fine . 
  yes , well , he would say that would n't he . 
  you think i 'm taking this ** seriously ** ? 
  it 's clear you 've not talked with many brits before . 
  my dear chap , i have n't been serious since `` quiet , you ! '', 
  it says a lot that you have to harken back to the romans to sound threatening . 
  heavens knows you have n't been worth a damn militarily since . 
  ( this is fun ), 
  i wonder why they 're watching left-wingers much more than right-wingers ? 
  that 's it !, 
  pistols at dawn !, 
  chilling stuff . 
  quiet , you !, 
  we 're in the eu neighbourhood , but we prefer to have our own house rather than a large apartment in the eu building . 
  a house with a moat . 
   * `` we are with europe but not of it . 
  we are linked but not combined . 
  *  * we are interested and associated but not absorbed . 
  '' * - winston churchill, 
  bit late for that . 
  we gave them back their countries !, 
  now if only they stayed in them !, 
  * blah blah semi-racist rant blah blah blah *, 
  but we do it best , you bank-busting fisherman . 
  welcome to the club , i suppose . 
  sceptic meetings are on thursdays at 9pm . 
  bring your own beer . 
  the same is true of any language in any country , really . 
  i hate us being the go-to country for immigrants , just because we speak english . 
  hating and killing each other , mostly . 
  the problem is , there 's multiple stop acta petitions on the website . 
  support has the risk of being spread across so many petitions that none of them individually reach the 100,000 mark . 
  could , yes . 
  will , no . 
  true . 
  while i do n't condone their behaviour , the rising numbers of people that belong to these groups causes some concern . 
  things do n't happen without a reason , right ? 
  we should address that underlying reason over anything else . 
  but by all means , let them have their meeting . 
  they have a right to say what they like , even if they 're being arseholes . 
  hang on , when did we get a new european president ? 
  to be fair , he 's from north korea . 
  he probably just got a little over-excited . 
  `` wait , you mean i can do stuff without being shot ?! '', 
  about time . 
  we need to step up technology wise . 
  from an rts standpoint , europe ca n't match the cheap unit spam of china , or the brute force tactics of america , so we need to be the flexible , technologically advanced faction . 
  we 've already got the best espionage in the world , and a lot ( maybe even the majority ) of inventors , scientists and engineers come from europe . 
  we just need the gear to match and we 're there . 
  goddamn it jackblack2323 , stop being stereotypical !, 
  i agree . 
  america is increasingly becoming contrary to european standards and more and more of a liability . 
  it 's a pity we 're stuck between a rock and a hard place here in britain . 
  between the eu , which has worse pr than chamberlain , and america , which has shown time and again that it does n't care about anything except their own interests . 
  i 'm consistently delighted with how inventive the art of subterfuge is . 
  i agree , but only because drawing scotland out of the eu will make them more likely to secede . 
  it 's easy to learn , but hard to master . 
  i notice germany is n't included in this picture , for some reason . 
  how very odd . 
  what is the net economic benefit ? 
  i 've heard about it at length , but never seen the actual numbers . 
   the rails networks are in the hands of one bunch of companies , the trains in the hands of others . 
  the latter pay the former to use the rails . 
  done . 
  that still does n't make sense . 
  if you need to use the train to get somewhere , you 're ca n't just say ` no , i do n't want to use that company , i 'll use that one ' because there 's only one train leaving that station at that time heading to that destination . 
  what kind of argument is that ? 
  scotland is part of the united kingdom by choice . 
  if it wants to leave , it can do so . 
  in fact , it 's having a referendum on it in the next few years !, 
  so your implication that we 're somehow holding scotland hostage is just plain silly . 
  good , good .
