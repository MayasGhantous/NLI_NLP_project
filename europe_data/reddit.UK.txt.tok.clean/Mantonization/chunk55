  feel the hate flow through you . 
  we are a net contributor . 
  we have always put into the eu more money than we have taken from it . 
  every year . 
  and we stick to the rules far more than other countries . 
  we 've been paying lots of dues , and in return we get little benefit and lots of hatred . 
  oh , wait , we get ` cheaper flights ' . 
  because that 's apparently something worth noting . 
  how on earth can you have competition in rail anyway ? 
  it 's inherently a monopoly . 
  you ca n't just throw down tracks and stations willy nilly , so if you need to use a train you have to use this train , at this station , at this price . 
  otherwise you 're screwed . 
  the market ca n't work in that sort of situation . 
  your analogy does not work , because there was no native population on the falklands to displace . 
   argentinians ( spaniards at that moment ) were there before and thus it is their land . 
  but as i 've already pointed out , you 're wrong . 
  while a spaniard did discover the islands , the first claims to the islands , and the first settlements on them , were french and british . 
  edit : also , i 'd like to correct my earlier statement . 
  while esteban g\u00f3mez was working for spain , he himself was portugese . 
  i 've given you a fucking argument . 
  but instead of refuting my points , you 've decided to just ignore it all ( especially the self-determination angle , which refutes your whole ` we 're just fucking over south america ' conspiracy ) and call us racists . 
  refute my argument or concede . 
  you have no counter argument , so you 've decided to just ignore everything and accuse me of racism . 
   argentinians discovered the islands about 100 years before a brit ** bzzzt !, 
  wrong !, 
  ** there 's evidence to support a ** spaniard ** esteban g\u00f3mez discovering the islands first in 1519 or 1520 , but no argentinians . 
  argentina as a country did not exist until 1816 . 
  regardless , the first colonies were french and british , in 1764 and 1765 respectably . 
  before that , there were ** no ** settlements on the islands . 
  none . 
  i think you 'll find it 's ** your ** argument that is invalid . 
  i just fucking gave you my argument . 
  here , i 'll put it in bold so you do n't miss it this time . 
  ** we had claim to the falklands before argentina even existed , and we 've owned them longer than argentina ten times over . 
  the ( illegal ) argentinian settlement only lasted a few years before being destroyed by america for basically being a pirate port . 
  the final nail in the coffin that is argentina 's claim is the right to self-determination , which the islanders hold under the un and international law . 
  they wish to remain british . 
  ** ** the falklands are british , argentina has no legitimate claim . 
  ** do you want me to put the answer to music ? 
   yes they have . 
  what a wonderful argument !, 
  we had claim to the falklands before argentina even existed , and we 've owned them longer than argentina ten times over . 
  the ( illegal ) argentinian settlement only lasted a few years before being destroyed by america for basically being a pirate port . 
  the final nail in the coffin that is argentina 's claim is the right to self-determination , which the islanders hold under the un and international law . 
  they wish to remain british . 
  the falklands are british , argentina has no legitimate claim . 
   at this very moment by not giving the malvinas to argentina argentina has ** no ** legitimate claim to the falklands , and you know it . 
   gibraltar to spain they 're fine with us having it . 
  the lone comment on this article makes me angry . 
  when was the last time we were ` imperialistic bastards ' ? 
  do n't just threaten , bloody do it !, 
  have some balls !, 
  well , if they want to implement it in their own country , then that 's their imperative . 
  you have to be british to understand . 
  how tragically ironic . 
  edit : just so we clear , i 'm not making some snide jab at europe . 
  it * is * tragically ironic that the thing set up to help european economies and stop them being downgraded * is itself * downgraded . 
  what topics , pray tell , are unrelated ? 
  and can i see your data that shows brits post more unrelated topics to this subreddit than any other nationality ? 
  stuff will happen . 
  the eu will probably be more integrated . 
  britain will be defiant , but sign up to the good things . 
  france will be a dick at some stage . 
  you know , the usual . 
  google translate is really sophisticated right now . 
  i 'm consistently impressed at how well it translates . 
  or maybe that 's just because german is a very logical language . 
  how very racist . 
  coffee is a drink for waking up or pulling an all-nighter . 
  tea is for any occasion , any time of the day . 
   i 'd personally be for an integrated military . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with it !, 
  yes , and that 's all well and good , but the problem is -  with the backing of the people , that is . 
  nobody knew it was happening until we found out that cameron had veto'ed it . 
  it did n't appear in any news outlet at all . 
  the whole thing just stinks of covert , anti-democratic law passing . 
  except that 's what happens . 
  for god sake , it happened in this very subreddit , when cameron used his veto . 
   like that proposed common armed forces hq you mean that one that nobody knew about and did n't come up in the news ** at all ** until they were already voting on it ? 
  yeah , a pinnacle of democratic integration , that was !, 
  there 's seems to be little difference between your two choices , sans the fact that in the latter others have to pretend to listen to your opinion before they reject it . 
  still not a point in the eu 's favour . 
  i 'd rather be politically insignificant but free , than in a strong political union but disposable . 
  john milton comes to mind . 
  you realise your post is n't in the eu 's favour , right ? 
  you 've basically just admitted it 's a bully of an organisation . 
  says it all , really, 
   i do n't particularly like it , but it 's true it bloody well is n't !, 
   what 's your alternative ? 
  what 's wrong with ` with europe but not of it ' ? 
  you do n't see anyone trying to scare the swiss or noggys into federalising by going ` oh but guys you 've ** got ** to join !, 
  if you do n't let us tell you what to do american / russia / china will invade and mistreat you forever and ever ** and that 's bad so let us do it first !, 
  ** ' the way you people go on about it , i 'm expecting warships to constantly be circling the coast like sharks . 
   i just wish they 'd stop blocking important legislation . 
  we do n't block more legislation than any other nation . 
  we accept more of what the eu says than others , and we have ** always ** put more money into it than we 've received . 
  but ** nooo ** , you veto one legislative piece that is unfairly biased against our banking sector and will kneecap us economically , and suddenly we 're the big bad obstructives !, 
   not a nation with industry anymore yes we bloody are !, 
  we 're the seventh biggest manufacturer in the world !, 
  used to be sixth , but brazil ( a country with other three times the landmass and three times the population ) ** just ** managed to overtake us last year !,
