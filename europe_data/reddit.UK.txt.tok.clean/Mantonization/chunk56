  i am sick of this false dichotomy this subreddit constantly pushes , that it 's a choice between being run by the eu , or being run by america / russia / china . 
  screw that . 
  screw that and the blue-with-gold-stars horse you rode in on . 
  trying to bully states with all the wordings of a protection racket will get you nowhere . 
  yes to staying in the eu . 
  i 'd like us to have a closer relationship with the eu instead of the us . 
  but i do n't really want my nation to cede sovereignty to brussels , or become part of a european federation , or switch to the euro . 
  the first two because i consider them less democratic / in ours interests than the current system , and the last one because the euro does n't seem like real money to me . 
  i 'll live in the neighbourhood , but i want us to own our own house , if you get what i 'm saying . 
  * dieu et mon droit * and all that . 
  funnily enough , norway completely refuses to hand prisoners over to the us . 
  they say american 's prison system counts as a violation of human rights . 
   we do n't need france and germany holding our hands . 
  i agree completely , but it would n't hurt to have their backing in this sort of thing . 
   i still believe he 's not going to america . 
  i believe the judge was right in ruling that he has a case to answer ( but not in the us ) . . but i think the extradition part will be overturned , simply because it 's wrong , as he has not committed a crime in the usa . 
  we 'll have to see . 
  he has not been charged under any british law . 
  he is not a us citizen . 
  neither he nor his operation were on us soil . 
  yet he will be sent there to be ( unfairly , considering how corporate america is ) charged under their laws , and thrown into the us prison system , which is ** so fucking bad ** that norway refuses to hand people over to america because they consider it a breach of human rights . 
  this is ** exactly ** the sort of thing the echr and ecj are for . 
  you know when people say ` we need to team up so we can be stronger politically ' ? 
  ** this . 
  this is why . 
  not a troll , just an arsehole . 
   you are already the us 's bitch ; do you really want to become the 51st state ? 
  do you want gibraltar back or not ? 
  your manner is not helping anyone . 
  reality , it seems , is not without a sense of irony . 
  i feel sorry for them . 
  this always happens to the french . 
  you have no idea how hard it is to not make a joke right now . 
  my humour lobe is thumping like crazy . 
  i agree completely . 
  i do n't suppose there 's some of petition system , or some way to contact the echr ? 
  i think this should be brought to their attention . 
  my comment keeps disappearing for some reason , how odd . 
  if you 're staying in london ( and are somehow feeling the need for a quiet , peaceful day out ) i recommend the museum / art galleries . 
  they 're all free to enter as far as i 'm aware , an they 're chock full of stuff that we 've plun - err , * acquired * over the many years . 
  i 'd recommend you avoid the tate modern though . 
  ever since they put that woman 's unmade bed in there i think it 's been rubbish . 
  i 'm really sorry i could n't recommend any music venues , but , well , i 'm really boring . 
  ** remember ** : you have never truly visited a country until you get stinking drunk in one of its pubs , then wake up in a ditch with a man you do n't know , yet he proclaims to be your best friend . 
  double points if you wake up in a different part of the country you started the night in . 
  doubt it . 
  and do n't ** you ** think ** we 'll ** accept to stand by and do nothing while being plundered by the people ** you ** protect . 
  oooh !, 
   some of my best friends are x , and ** they ** agree with y !, 
  aah , that old , rancid chestnut . 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb and say ` damn near all of it ' . 
  you seem to be under the impression that we never accept anything in the eu , and that 's plain not true . 
  we accept a lot of what the eu says , and we have always put more in than we have received . 
  we have always been willing to compromise and work with the eu , ** except ** when something is obviously , and shamelessly , an attack on us or our interests . 
  the tobin tax is . 
  we were willing to compromise though , because we do agree on the whole regulating banks thing and wanted to come to an agreement . 
  the * petit caporal * however , refused . 
  we said that we would use our veto in self defence , so we did . 
  oh please . 
  cameron tried to compromise , and you know it . 
  but sarkozy had to go and say * ` non ' * . 
  i think you 'll find that it was the eu that was unnecessarily rigid here , not britain . 
  we 're not going to let you turn us into your sacrificial scapegoat . 
  you can piss off with your unfair comparisons as well . 
  this is n't even close to piracy . 
  this is more like a poll tax than anything else . 
  that is an unfair comparison , mein freund , and you bloody well know it . 
   so you want access to the finanical market without playing by any other rules than your own if by that you mean we do n't want to follow a law that obviously and shamelessly discriminates against us , than you are right . 
  this . 
  this this this this this . 
  why does no one get this point ? 
  as is , this tax would unfairly effect us compared to other countries . 
  us voting for it would be financially shooting ourselves in the foot . 
   the south is more regressive because of northern liberals/progressives imposing federalism on them that is nothing but conjecture  had things had a chance to run their natural course and play out , i think you 'd see a different south . 
  especially because slaves and their sympathisers would have had to work it out amongst themselves against pro-slave owners . 
  it would have given the former dignity and knocked the latter down a few pegs . 
  as is this . 
  like iran , you mean ? 
  because they have n't had liberal / progressive thought thrust upon them , and they 're doing just fine !, 
  it 's not like they 're a religious dictatorship that executes people for blasphemy !, 
  first the beansprouts , now the chicken !, 
  germany , what are you ** doing ** ? 
  the thing with salmond is that i get the impression that he does n't comprehend ( or perhaps just does n't care ) about what the ramifications of scotland seceding will be . 
  aside from all stuff i 've mentioned below , it would be an administrative nightmare to sort out . 
  plus , the labour base in scotland is a big balancing factor to the tory base in the south . 
  by seceding , they would be making the tory percentage in the uk bigger , and essentially throwing anyone who agrees with their views / labour under a bus . 
  or to put it another way : he would be throwing everyone in the united kingdom who does n't live in scotland , especially the people who agree with his party , ** into the hands of the political party he opposes ** . 
  the bastard . 
  not quite . 
  they belong to britain , and the majority of them would fall to westminster by default . 
  if scotland does secede ( i sincerely hope they do n't , and stop listening to that toad salmond ) they 'd need to buddy up to the eu to economically survive . 
  at least , at first . 
  they 'd need to , since they 're kept afloat by us . 
  especially when it comes to the fact that they have things better than us when it comes to things like uni fees , public transport , healthcare , etc etc. 
  plus they can vote on english matters , while we ca n't do vice versa . 
  i 'm feeling very proletarian on the whole matter , i must say . 
  \u0449 ( \uff9f\u0414\uff9f\u0449 ) pardon my anglo-saxon when i say : what a stupid fucking bitch . 
  sure . 
  disabled ? 
  not the right term at all .
