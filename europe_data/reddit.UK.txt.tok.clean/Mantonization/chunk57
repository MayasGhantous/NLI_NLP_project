  i wonder if special facilities will have to be put in place in greek workplaces ? 
  you know , like wheelchair ramps ? 
  but instead it 's a mould of a child 's arse stuck on a toilet wall , or something . 
  i 'll be honest with you here , i was actually making a joke . 
  i think everyone else but you got that . 
  we could kill two birds with one stone !, 
  or three , in fact !, 
  not only would we have a safe moon haven , ** and ** kill hitler , but we can also recover all the nazi loot that was n't thrown into [ lake toplitz !, 
  ] ( http://www.cracked.com/article/18358_5-real-buried-treasures-that-can-make-you-rich-or-kill-you_p2/ ), 
  you make an excellent point . 
  any poll like this should be taken with a pinch of salt , as it will undoubtedly suffer from audience bias . 
  we do n't block everything , and i suggest you retract that remark . 
  britain has been very co-operative with the eu , on the whole . 
  and ever since we have joined we have also put in more than we have received , ** every ** year to date . 
  also we always tried , to the best of our ability , to keep within eu set limits and legislation . 
  we are not the only country with a veto . 
  while cameron 's use of said veto of last year was extremely controversial , there is no need for such false accusations nor slander . 
  tl ; dr : fuck off , we do not . 
  historically , everyone between germany and russia ( czech republic , poland , etc ) has . 
  we 'll just have to make lots of them !, 
  and bunkers !, 
  or maybe a moon colony ? 
  i know germany secretly put one up there in 1942 , we could use that one !, 
  climatologically speaking , your women are , in fact , very cold . 
  unless indoors . 
   the mere thought of a religious wacko like santorum being in the same building as the big red button gives me the heeby-jeebies . 
  my god , i had n't even thought of that . 
  can we put up some kind of nuclear defence shield ? 
  that should be pretty high on brussel 's list . 
  americans ? 
  learn ? 
  this is why i feel we should distance ourselves from america and move closer to europe . 
  we may argue over specific methods in europe , but at least we 're all on the same mental page . 
  it 's very jarring to see people jostling for position of one of the most - if not ** the ** most - powerful man in the world preach about how we apparently suck . 
  especially when we 're supposed to be allies . 
  * and your price is ... a gun !, 
  * * unfortunately , due to budgetary constraints we could only afford to give you one bullet !, 
  spend it wisely now !, 
  * / a joke, 
  on the whole , i think i 'm okay with it . 
  germany seems to be the superego of the european union . 
  having them in the safest seat is a good way to go . 
  especially since they 're in a union that includes the id of france . 
  sorry to butt in , but is n't it the case with ( some ) national elections that citizens living / working abroad can still vote ? 
  would that not be allowed for the independence referendum ? 
  it seems that no matter what happens , it 's good for germany . 
  i do n't know how you 've managed to put your country in that sweet spot . 
  so what ( if any ) are the possible future ramifications of this ? 
  you say that , and yet it is the case . 
  hence such things as german / french / british airspace . 
  borders are borders . 
  all the way to the bottom , all the way to the top . 
  i do n't know if these proposals are good or not ( i hope they 're not bad , because i do n't like having my idealism shat upon , if you 'll pardon my anglo-saxon ) but when i hear the words ` more power for eu commission ' alarm bells start ringing in my head . 
  and i 'm not entirely sure why . 
  aah , but england has been at war with france on and off since at least the normans . 
  it 's more ingrained into our national psyche . 
  and it 's not half-serious . 
  it 's not even a quarter , or an eight serious . 
  it 's not serious at all . 
  this . 
  seriously guys . 
  that 's nice to hear , i suppose . 
  best : healthcare , comedy , not being french . 
  worst : trains , workmen , self-defence laws . 
  well i did n't see it , so ner ner ner ner ner, 
  http://www.cracked.com/article_19363_6-reasons-your-plans-to-move-abroad-might-not-work-out.html you seem to be channelling the problem expressed in number 5 . 
  easy . 
  stop funding hungary . 
  is n't hungary heavily dependant on eu funds ? 
  this seems like a problem that has an obvious , economics-based solution . 
  what are you expecting ? 
  a story about some baby ducks he saw while on his way to work ? 
  they should put that on a sign in brussels . 
  ** ` the european union - vajazzles and laughing at america ' **, 
  i 'm disgusted that we both know what that is . 
   innocent until proven guilty ... right to remain silent ... etc , um , yeah , ** we have those too ** you know . 
  and yet we still have those laws against lying on air . 
   and that they knew it was false and that it was not just a mistake . 
  so what you 're saying is , they 're allowed to lie on the air ? 
   you still may work after , but you should have enough money not to have to . 
  oh , i agree 100 % . 
  but you should still be able to work if you wish . 
  the best example is teachers who love their work , and have the mental faculties ( hehe ) to continue to do so , yet are forcibly retired when they hit a certain age . 
  that 's not right . 
  the daily mail is just fox news in written form . 
  as far as i 'm aware , most countries in europe have a law that states that a newsreader is not allowed to intentionally lie or mislead while on the air . 
  oh hey , hungary ? 
  i 'm sorry to hear about your countries problems . 
  sometimes i wonder if we should have just gone the whole hog back in 1812 . 
  would the world be a better place ? 
  edit : i 'm just so ** angry ** . 
  i grew up being taught that america is this great big place far away , full of nice people like us . 
  for better ( and later i learned , for worse ) everything was bigger in america . 
  and year after year , i learn of more and more shitty acts that country has perpetrated . 
  and continues to do so !, 
  and what 's sick is that the majority seem to support it !, 
  for fuck sake , when a politician was asked if a man without health insurance should be left to die , people cheered !, 
  every year my heart sinks , and my opinion of the place drops lower and lower , and a threshold appears to have finally been crossed . 
  i obviously ca n't speak for everyone in it , but i 'm saying this now : america is an evil country . 
  it is a wolf in sheep 's clothing ; a hypocritical ; freedom sucking ; planet choking ; unjust behemoth of a state , more in line with china and ( pre-revolution ) libya than the greek democracies it was originally based on .
