  side note : it 's lovely how easily we can all put our differences aside in a common goal . 
  in this case , laughing at america . 
  in america they have no laws regarding inaccuracy on the news . 
  you are allowed to lie on the news in america . 
  it 's insane . 
  that makes it even more hilarious , since the red dot for the united kingdom appears to be over edinburgh . 
  what does ` retaliatory measures ' mean exactly ? 
  china sounds more and more like a cartoon villain every day . 
  did n't they threaten to pump billions of tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere if they did n't get their way last year ? 
  to be fair , people are living longer , so they can work longer . 
  will this be a mandatory retirement age ? 
  because i am firmly against that . 
  people should be able to continue doing a job they like if they are of sound mind , no matter their age . 
  yes , it will increase it . 
  i 'm not sure it really has the right to call itself a newspaper , since all it 's doing is linking stories from other sites . 
  the only parts that seem written by themselves are the opinion pieces . 
  i 'm in the west country , as it turns out . 
  you could argue that financial autonomy is a very good thing , as you can devalue it as you please to combat debt / inflation , and ( perhaps more importantly ) you wo n't be financially tied to the piigs . 
  angry sounding instruction manuals . 
  i think hearing how possible future rulers of america ( which is , like it or not , one of the if not the most powerful country in the world right now ) are slandering us is very related to europe . 
  it 's hard to keep an alliance with a country if its leading party keeps telling its people how awful we apparently are . 
   battling for attention ahead of their first election showdown , leading republican presidential candidates have taken turns accusing one another and president barack obama of ` european socialism ' aah yes , i can picture it now . 
  each of them accusing the other of wanting to give the people healthcare , workers rights , environmental laws , etc etc. 
  it sounds positively hellish !, 
  i do n't really see any tangible benefit to the eu here ( probably because the eu has slightly worse pr than sauron in britain ) so i ca n't really say much for them . 
  big surprise , i know . 
  assuming you do join , will you immediately switch over to the euro ? 
  if so , i hope you 're not too romantically attached to your currency . 
  so it 's a dictatorship , yes ? 
  oh , also , i 'd like it if sarkozy lost his next election . 
  insolent little man . 
  no matter how peeved they got , you would n't find cameron or merkel shouting at other leaders to shut up . 
  on a european scale ? 
  an end to the financial crisis might be nice , or at least an improvement . 
  more voluntary integration too , at the expense of less involuntary integration . 
  i 'm fine with this eu thing happening if everyone involved wants to be involved . 
  nobody should be dragged into anything they 're not comfortable with . 
  they 've only replaced it with another type of scaremongering , so little has changed . 
  instead of * ` we have to unite or we 'll kill each other !, 
  oooooooooo !, 
  * ' it 's now * ` we have to unite or someone else will kill us all !, 
  oooooooooo !, 
  ' * pardon my french when i say : fuck that noise . 
  i take it russia is still anal anguished at ukraine then ? 
  it 's not quite a total failure yet , but it 's hardly a success . 
  it just is . 
  are you trying to put down any and all euroscepticism as racism ? 
  a more interesting question would be : what would happen if america declared war on ** europe ** . 
  maybe the next republican president decided to try take the falklands oil , or teach the french not to say no when america wants to go to war . 
  something silly like that . 
  i do n't think cameron would . 
  cameron and obama seem to have a much colder / more professional relationship than blair and bush . 
  have mayans invaded yet ? 
  i 've been wondering , what happens if one of these undersea tunnels actually gets flooded ? 
  is there a contingency plan in place for repairs / draining ? 
  oh god no . 
  i 'd rather brussels than washington . 
  at least europe is n't insane . 
  edit : let me clarify this . 
  although we have many differences , in europe we 're all roughly on the same political and cultural scale . 
  and we all believe in things like environmental laws , not being allowed to lie on the news , and socialised healthcare . 
  americas policies ( or at least , all of the republicans and quite a few of the democrats ) are the opposite of what we think is right . 
  i mean , have you seen the things the current republican nominees have said ? 
  if anyone in europe said that they would be laughed / booed out of politics , yet over there they get support !, 
  letting people die because they ca n't afford extortionist health insurance ** gets applauded ** . 
  our right-most political party is still far , far left of their left-most party . 
  it just would n't work to be with them over europe . 
  no matter how different we are to the mainland , we 're ** much ** more different to america . 
  so the answer to an eu agency sucking up to the us ... is to make the eu even bigger ? 
  so much for that strong french sense of liberty . 
  forcing people who are different ( and want to remain separate ) together wo n't suddenly stop nationalistic bickering . 
  in fact , you will have the opposite effect . 
  it 's like a chinese finger trap . 
  if you let the people slowly come together under their own volition , then everything will be fine . 
  but if you quickly force people together , you will be fought against every single bloody step of the way . 
  edit : also , you would n't be getting away from nationalist bickering at all !, 
  you 'd just be replacing the tribe of your country for the much bigger tribe of europe . 
  you claim a want to be free from such thoughts , yet you 're advocating it on a larger scale than it exists currently !, 
  you 're pretty accurate . 
  most of us do n't know and / or do n't care what happens in the eu . 
  it 's something that happens on the mainland . 
  this is probably why so many of us are eurosceptical . 
  something that seems so far away and not-important can suddenly be in our faces , demanding we label things high fat offal tubes or whatever . 
  i ** want ** to like israel , i do , but things just keep coming up that make me hate it . 
  and now i can add this to the list . 
  so , do you think they 'll blame us for that ? 
  the fact that they ** removed the galaxy truffle from the celebrations tins this year . 
  shut the fuck up . 
  and when that shortage happens , there 'll suddenly be a massive surge in recycling technologies . 
  the technology is there , but we 're just not using it because we 're procrastinating idiots . 
  it 's hardly just posturing . 
  okay it probably wo n't stop them executing people , it will be just sending them a message . 
  but we - the people of europe - have decided that we no longer wish to be a part of that system . 
  that 's something good , i think . 
  and also ** we ** wo n't be the ones selling them the necessary chemicals . 
  they 'll still do it , but we wo n't be a part of it . 
  and that 's what i 'm celebrating . 
   the european union is now blocking importation of lethal injection technology into the united states hooray !, 
  glad to see the eu doing something good . 
   there 's potentially a very good system there , with borders set along the lines of the european constituencies .
