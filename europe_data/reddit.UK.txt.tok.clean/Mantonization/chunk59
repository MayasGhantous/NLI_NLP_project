  shall we just name ourselves airstrip one while we 're at it ? 
  well best of luck to them , but i would n't hold my breath for a fast or smooth result . 
  well then , now we ** know ** it 's a good idea !, 
  i 'm not joking with that . 
  the general rule seems to be that if americans are lobbying against it , it 's a good move . 
  pizza as a vegetable , etc. 
   n ireland joins up with ireland that wo n't happen . 
  n ireland have consistently voted to not join up with the roi . 
  they 're pretty much different countries now . 
  oh piss off . 
  you 're communicating through a text-only medium . 
  unless you point it out , there is no way for me to tell if you 're joking , or just being an arse . 
  the uk is better off now despite of thatcher . 
  she privatised the rail , brought over ` fuck you i got mine ' reaganomics from america , and she turned our economy into the banking one / r/europe so despises . 
  plus , she never ever changed her mind . 
  she was n't a leader . 
  she was a ruler , and a bad one at that . 
  you know what i think we need ? 
  a good war . 
  i 'm mostly joking with that line , but it would be an effective way to draw us all together . 
  if we 're going to be the allied nations , we 'll need a soviet union equivalent to band together against . 
  or at a stretch , nod . 
  for once i agree with the comments on ` have your say ' . 
  ` fancy a pint ? ', 
  sounds a lot better than ` fancy a litre ? ', 
  maybe it 's not lost ? 
  maybe ( heaven forbid ) it was n't even there to begin with ? 
  staircase wit has led me back here : would n't that mean that europe would be run from belgium ? 
  it should be run from neutral territory . 
  perhaps the flying aircraft carrier from doctor who or something . 
  or a space station . 
  the british do n't have revolutions . 
  we have satire . 
  which is n't to say that we dislike the french as people . 
  quite the opposite . 
  we 've been fighting , annoying , ( once ) saving , and generally infuriating them for over a thousand years !, 
  how can you not like someone after a history like that !, 
  i think der spiegel is falling into that old trap of thinking that correlation equals causation . 
  and also thinking that the tabloids represent the common man . 
  maybe the insane man who stands on the corner and shouts at traffic , but the common man ? 
   he added : `` my main message is for the british people - you can count on us , and we count on you . '', 
  yes , well , you ** would ** say that we could count on you , would n't you ? 
  eeee-yup . 
  and since we get shouted at when we say anything different from france or germany , we 've decided to just go with it and say we 're broke . 
  on a personal level , i 'm not sure to think . 
  i mean , we 're not in the eurozone , so it feels ( to me ) giving them more money feels like foreign aid , rather than a helping prop up something we 're part of . 
  also , would any of this money have gone towards places like greece or italy ? 
  because i 'm not sure i 'd approve of that . 
  i am sorry , but my attitude towards them is like how others feel about the banks . 
  if they fucked up , they should fail . 
  you made your bed , now lie in it , and all that . 
  edit : buuut , i suppose that no matter how much i hate the idea , if push came to shove i 'd support it . 
  because that 's how doing the right thing works , i guess ? 
  i 'm gon na agree with you on that . 
  perhaps the parliament will shoot it down because of that very fact ? 
   have fun being glum eyeore , britons we do . 
  that 's why we act so . 
  enjoyable moaning with a smug omniscience when things do go wrong ? 
  yes please !, 
  i think it 's the entire eu that has an image problem , not just the low level staff . 
  i know right ? 
  i 'm reading it in palpatine 's voice . 
  what , like america ? 
  ehhhh , no thanks . 
  what will you do ? 
  burn flags ? 
  force all books to be translated to a new language ? 
  i get what you 're trying to say , but your words make me uneasy , as you seem to have an almost borg-like enthusiasm for the death of differences . 
  your efforts may end up having the opposite effect . 
  good night , sweet prince . 
  now there was a man who knew the value of freedom . 
  he will be missed . 
  i 'm very much doubting this is the woman herself 's twitter , but either way it 's hilarious . 
  and zen our troops will march straight to whitehall !, 
  / a joke, 
  call me cynical , but this article ( or at least , the first page of it ) seems more like an attempt at getting mrs merkel better pr than anything else . 
  i might even go so far as to call it a blatant attempt for it . 
  ** but ** , on the other hand , i do think that is what the eu needs . 
  it and its leaders are a bit of a bogeyman to the press and the public , who hear and report the bad but seldom report or hear the good . 
  having a better public image would not only make the workings between britain and europe smoother ( and perhaps even pave the way for further integration ) but will shut up those who inevitably start calling for another war . 
  i 'm just talking about my own country there , but i imagine that what i 'm saying might apply to other countries as well . 
  sure !, 
  do you want me to shoot myself in the foot while i 'm at it ? 
  congratulations to all officers involved , yadda yadda . 
  seriously chaps , well done . 
  it does n't . 
  good enough ? 
  to be fair ( although i agree with your sentiment 100 % ) sometimes it 's not a matter of doing something because you like it , but because you must . 
  of course we 're not . 
  we 'd just prefer to not share a house with them is all . 
  ( in my head , the eu is like a big block of flats ), 
  but ... people have killed over good and bad weather !, 
  it may be the straw that breaks the camels back more than anything , but it happens !, 
  what 's he gon na do ? 
  send his flying monkeys at us ? 
  i do n't really know anything about french politics . 
  but i imagine that they 're a bit like ours , in that there 's a lot of loud , amusing arguing . 
  it 's so dank and depressing . 
  just like home . 
  what is it about today that 's causing all this ?
