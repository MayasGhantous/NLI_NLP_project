  is there something in the air ? 
  what a dreary place . 
  it looks like a black and white photo , and someone has coloured all the vehicles in . 
  on a whim , i checked the fox news article on this and scrolled down to the comments . 
  they 're just blaming liberals and muslims . 
  it 's brevik all over again . 
  that 's good , yes ? 
  oh god , that 's not good . 
  my sympathies go towards all involved ( except the gunmen , of course ), 
  `` no mr cameron , i expect you to sign ... ** ze agreement ** ! '', 
   non elected there are criteria for being a member of the hol . 
  there 's a process involved . 
   selected by birthright yeah , that 's not true either . 
  now i know you 're just ignorant . 
   while the uk remains exempt from some of the sanctions and fines that can be applied to eurozone states , the government must still submit its fiscal plans for surveillance by brussels . 
  while i 'm sure it 's not as bad as i imagine , the fact that my government has to submit its fiscal plans to brussels makes me ** deeply ** uncomfortable . 
  the wording brings to mind a schoolboy handing in his homework to an irate headmaster . 
  fuck you too mate . 
  yes , well , he would say that would n't he ? 
   has the banking industry in any country contributed at all ? 
  if you take into account the bailouts i do n't believe they have . 
  what have the romans ever done for us ? 
   right now it threatens to sink not only our economies , but also our democracies with it ... 
  there are people saying the age of enlightment is over . 
  goodbye democracy , goodbye public welfare , goodbye magna carta ... 
  i do believe you 're exaggerating . 
  look , i want to be tougher on banks , okay ? 
  ** i want that as well !, 
  ** but i ** do n't want ** an ill-thought solution that would lead to us becoming financially damaged . 
  i do n't want my country to become collateral damage . 
  can we agree that that is a fair desire ? 
  and if you dare say ` you ca n't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs ' i will reach through the internet and slap you . 
   you are completely overstating the possible effects of this tax . 
  it 's not going to cripple britain financially in any way . 
  why on earth would you think so ? 
  except that it will . 
  since the financial sector is huge in britain , the majority of eu money from that tax will come from britain ( i believe someone here said it would cost us something like # 50bn a year ) . 
  and that 's not even taking to account business lost as banks and such move to greener pastures . 
   this is about `` feelings '' . 
  and the same reason why many things do n't work politically . 
  because people do n't `` feel '' good about it . 
  and vote against it . 
  hey , you asked what my feelings on the eu were . 
  i gave them . 
   for better or for worse . 
  i think it is often almost impossible to gauge if those huge projects ( eu , euro , large infrastructure projects ) will have a net benefit for the public . 
  i disagree . 
  with large infrastructure projects for example , the long term benefits are usually known before construction even starts . 
  that 's what encourages people to build them in the first place . 
  but nobody seems to offer a long term benefit to us accepting the tobin tax . 
  and that makes me wonder if there even was one . 
   and nowhere has it been more evident than in the uk itself , where the financial industry has teken over and is calling the shots . 
  very much to the disadvantage of the uk public , which has been completely outsold by their government to greedy london financial brokers . 
  so call me surprised that i am having this conversation with none other an englishman . 
  spin aside ( and there 's a lot of spin in your statement ) you do n't knock down the biggest load-bearing pillar in your house , no matter how ugly it is . 
  do i like the banks ? 
  not particularly , no . 
  i think they 're a bunch of overpaid corrupt arseholes . 
  do i want my pm to accept a tax that will inflict some justice on them ? 
  not if it means ruining the country in the process . 
  it 'd be like sawing off your arm to treat a paper cut on your finger . 
   if you do n't think the uk should be part of the eu , then please state that opinion . 
  it 's totally fine . 
  my views on that can be found [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/n6n7g/dae_worry_us_not_being_an_integral_part_of_the_eu/c36pib8 ) this is n't really me being angry at the eu . 
  it 's me being angry at people who ca n't grasp the fact that * if something is against britain 's interests , cameron is n't going to vote for it . 
  * i 'm counting long-term as well as short-term in that . 
  nobody seems to know what the long-term effects of britain agreeing to the tobin tax would be , but we all know what the short-term would be . 
  mainly , britain being financially crippled , and ( at worst ) thrown down to the same level of prosperity as ireland or greece . 
  people saying that we support crony capitalism because we did n't agree to the tobin tax are just as stupid as people who say that we support the death penalty because we do n't agree to hang ourselves . 
  his name sounds like a villain , and he [ looks ] ( http://www.enjoyfrance.com/images/stories/france/political/dominique-de-villepin-pm.jpg ) like a movie star . 
  what are his policies like though ? 
  so suddenly being against a tax that would financially ruin our country is siding with bankers and crony capitalism ? 
  only in europe !, 
  i suppose you think that if you do n't hang yourself you 're supporting the death penalty , right ? 
  same logic . 
  this brings up a question i 've oft ' wondered . 
  why is strasbourg saying we should let prisoners vote ? 
  i still think the bbc is a great source though . 
  the left accuse it of being biased towards the right , and the right accuse it of being biased towards the left . 
  so it must be doing something right . 
  to be fair , the representatives from wales and scotland are never happy . 
  they ( or at least , the scottish one ) would jump off a cliff if the english said they would n't . 
  ** to the britmobile !, 
  can we leave , but you make it look like you 're kicking us out ? 
  '' * you ca n't fire me , i quit !, 
  and - perhaps ironically - the constant being told that we 're european does n't sway us to that viewpoint , but in fact the opposite way . 
  we feel they doth protest too much . 
  oh god . 
  if we do n't stop him , he 'll be elected king of the universe by 2016 !, 
  oh jeez , i completely forgot about mandy . 
  he 's now the eu trade commissioner ? 
  maybe the lord of darkness will finally feel at home ? 
  ( * do n't listen to him !, 
  take the bait !, 
  `` for you mr cameron , ze politics are over '', 
  the system is n't ** inherently ** undemocratic . 
  and how is this the only way to preserve to our cultures and ways of life ? 
  the implication seems to be that without the eu , they 'd all disappear overnight . 
  i would n't say so . 
  and even if they were that does n't make them ** bad ** they 're an essential brake on the vehicle of politics .
