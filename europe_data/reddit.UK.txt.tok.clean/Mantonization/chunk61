  because they 're not beholden to any voters or agendas , they can stop retarded laws before they pass . 
   contrary to many , i see a united europe as the only way to preserve our cultures and our ways of life . 
  explain . 
  i honestly do n't understand how that could be the case . 
  oh , but you do . 
  a fatty breakfast is great in the winter , but in the heat of summer i do n't think you 'll be so keen to have one . 
  some bluff !, 
  ta for the clarification , but that somehow just as unfortunately implicating !, 
  now they see us as rebellious teenagers ? 
  ehh you 're only saying that because it 's winter . 
  we do n't have much in the way of light , summer food . 
  i was just trying to be sarcastic / humorous more than anything . 
  serves me right for trying to do it through a text only medium , eh ? 
  i know boq , i was just challenging deusdies claim with an equally untrue counter-claim . 
  it 's bringing out the worst of everywhere 's press . 
  do n't talk shit about the house of lords !, 
  just like how it 's funny all the articles attacking him come from german ones ? 
  aah the spectator . 
  lovely publication . 
  that aside , i think this is an article everyone should read . 
  makes you wonder just ** why ** the proposal was put in front of cameron in the first place . 
  you ca n't help but think those conspiracy theories might have a point . 
  i had to look it up too . 
  ` noisy and difficult to control ' , huh ? 
  gives the unfortunate implication that the eu wants to control britain , does n't it . 
  poor russia . 
  place just ca n't catch a break !, 
  i 'm not so sure . 
  it seems to be trying to be neutral . 
  it mentions a few times we 've been right , for example . 
  if it was totally pandering to petty anti-uk sentiment , it would go on about how we 're always wrong and how much we suck . 
  a jab at our cooking might also be added . 
  huh , well then !, 
  in the interest of fairness , i should say that the man who built his house on the rocks was isolated too . 
  ` isolated ' does n't necessarily equal ` wrong ' . 
  at the end of the day , i 'm glad we did n't go in . 
  which is n't to say i 'm anti-eu . 
  quite the opposite . 
  i like the concept of the eu very much . 
  but i am fundamentally against the idea of us being rushed or forced into it ( especially when it involves an agreement that would heavily damage us financially ) . 
  for once der spiegel and i seem to be on the same wavelength . 
  a forced marriage is going to end in failure . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 'll end up joining the eu proper one day - it seems almost inevitable . 
  but we will work towards that day at our own pace , and join it when we are fully ready and comfortable with it . 
  and not a single bloody second sooner . 
   and trust that it will be judged on it 's merits . 
  there 's the problem right there . 
  we live in an age of mass media . 
  you ca n't just ignore that and hope the people will make an informed decision . 
  they wo n't . 
  the eu 's opponents are using it to sway people to their side , and for the pro-eu side to not do likewise is self-defeating . 
  you say you do n't give a shit , but you intentionally went out of your way to insult . 
  methinks you doth protest too much . 
  it says a lot about this forum that you had to ask . 
   if you 've ever studied game theory then you might know of a golden rule discovered during the cold war - * never , ever put your opponent in a position where they have only one choice other than defeat * , because they will take that option over defeat almost every time . 
  i 'm going to write this ( and in fact your whole post ) down somewhere , because it 's all brilliant . 
  huh , that 's pretty clever i suppose . 
  but the smaller coins are n't like that , are they ? 
  do they not care as much if those are faked ? 
   `` do what we say or be destroyed '' sounds awfully militaristic . 
  and all military things are ww2 related ? 
  i think you 're projecting a little , old boy . 
   in converse , why should we accept our economies being plundered by your banks ? 
  our banks are hardly the lifeblood-sucking vampires you seem to portray them as . 
   we tried to find compromises if you 'll pardon my language - like fuck you did !, 
   it 's not our fault you do nothing but shady finance deals again , you 're trying to portray our banks a few shades more monstrous than they actually are . 
  and to be frank , you can shove that implication - that all our banks do nothing but shady deals - where the sun does n't shine . 
  this agreement would have ruined ** all ** our financial businesses , honest or not . 
   we want them regulated and their destructiveness limited . 
  so do we !, 
  but we do n't want to be destroyed in the process !, 
   again . . why should we just accept your refusal to change anything ? 
  we do n't ` refuse to change anything ' . 
  we 've accepted and done many things that the eu has wanted . 
  this one thing has been rejected though because it will ruin us . 
   cameron causing a `` two-speed '' europe will inevitably create a dynamic that pushes the uk further away from europe . 
  alternatively , it will lead the uk ( and other countries ) becoming closer with europe , as we 're no longer being rushed or forced into it . 
   i know you 're so fond of ww2 metaphors , but still . . 
  it 's nearly 2012 ... where have i used a ww2 metaphor ? 
   i know you do n't like to hear it , but it 's totally true : you need us more than we need you . 
  and that 's why we should financially hang ourselves at the eu 's behest , is it ? 
   remember the billions your and the us finance industry destroyed lately ? 
  that 's why it 's different . 
  first off , you say that it was all our fault , now you 're saying it 's us and the us ? 
  back peddling are we ? 
  second , that 's your justification ? 
  ` oh your banks wrecked things , so it 's totally okay for us to completely ruin your entire country ' ? 
  do two wrongs suddenly make a right ? 
   well . . agree and stay in the eu or disagree and have inertia carrying you out of teh eu orbit and face the trouble alone . 
  so now it 's an issue of ` do what we say or be destroyed ' ? 
  wow , what a great argument !, 
  i 'm certainly convinced !, 
   but expecting that other countries accept disadvantages when their economic survival is at stake to futher accomodate the uk is mindbogglingly stupid . 
  and yet you expect britain to accept disadvantages when it 's our economic survival at stake , to further accommodate the eu ? 
  talk about hypocrisy !, 
   your finance industry , the very same industry that just destroyed billions with its retardedly risky behaviour . 
  oh yeah , because it 's purely our financial sector that destroyed the world economy twice !, 
  oh course !, 
  / s  personally i would laugh my ass off about the irony of your finance industry packing up and moving to new york or singapore or whatever because they can no longer do business with the eu regulations we will put in place now . 
  they would have almost certainly done that if we 'd agreed to your regulations !,
