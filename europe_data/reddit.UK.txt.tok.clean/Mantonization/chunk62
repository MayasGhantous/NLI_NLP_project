  now you 're saying that will happen anyway ? 
  talk about damned if we do , damned if we do n't !, 
   well , outside of your untenable financial industry that is already the case . 
  for many people in your country , this is already reality . 
  or what do you think the riots where about ? 
  you still have n't answered my question . 
  what would the eu do if britain - a very large economy in europe - agreed to your regulations , and became financially ruined as a result ? 
  what would the eu do then ? 
   stability . 
  yes , well , i suppose ruined is stable . 
  that was a joke ( i hope ) , but do elaborate on how this will give us stability . 
   we did not throw y' all under the bus -- cameron did . 
  i 'm talking about the thing cameron did n't agree to . 
  that would have ruined us financially . 
  possibly even knocked us down to ireland or greece levels . 
  the eu seems very angry that we did n't agree to that , but assuming we had agreed to that , what would the eu have done ** then ** ? 
  what happens if we agree to it and become economically fucked ? 
  what happens ** then ** ? 
  as compared to short term ruin with long term ... what ? 
  you all seem very willing to throw us under a bus here , but you do n't seem to have a plan for afterwards . 
  yeah , like the two pound coin . 
  i think that one is odd as well . 
  it probably is just for aesthetic reasons . 
  it 's a very ... memorable design . 
   northern ireland in ireland you know the northern irish have consistently voted to ** not ** rejoin the roi and to stay with britain , right ? 
   i 'd imagine they would get ridiculed further though of course they would . 
  but if they kept putting their message out there , eventually people would come around . 
  or at least be more educated on the subject and less likely to knee-jerk into an anti-eu stance . 
  * telling the people your good points , and being ridiculed for a small time at the beginning , but eventually winning them over *  * not telling the people your good points , so that they continue to only hear the bad , and then acting all surprised and angry when they do n't want to join you . 
  * surely ? 
  i 've never really understood the euro coin 's design . 
  what 's the point of a ring of different coloured metal around the centre ? 
  is it just to look different ? 
   but i do n't think they can compete with the relentlessness of many of the british rags . 
  they do n't seem to even be trying though . 
  i mean , this is just a website you 've linked . 
  not in the public eye at all . 
  off the top of my head , they could do advertisements ( both written , in magazines and on billboards / bus sides ) or perhaps radio / tv ads . 
  a bit costly , yes . 
  but they want britain on side , do n't they ? 
  convincing the populace of its good points would be a step in the right direction . 
  it seems that the european union has the worst pr imaginable in britain . 
  maybe more work should be put into that ? 
  if people are convinced that something is bad , you should n't try and force it through or call the people who wo n't have it ` cowards ' . 
  you 'd just be , in their eyes , justifying their fears . 
  maybe the eu should try improving its image ? 
  proving / showing / telling the british people that it 's not a bogeyman out to ruin us would help their cause immensely . 
  edit : and why am i getting downvoted for this ? 
  am i wrong ? 
  does the eu not have awful pr in britain ? 
  or are you all just immediately downvoting what i say the moment you see it , without even reading it ? 
   do n't uk prime ministers swear to protect and prevent harm for the uk ? 
  yes , and that 's the heart of the matter . 
  agreeing to the thing would have brought great harm to the uk . 
  it would have financially ruined us . 
  edit : or at least , that is what cameron seems to believe . 
   everyone else could not care less about the eu reputation in britain , the way we perceive it it is already much lower than anywhere else in the union . 
  fine , but you have no right to complain then when nobody in britain wants to work with you . 
   britain does n't seem the least bit concerned with any eu interests that do n't completely match its own agenda no , we 're not concerned with eu interests that are fundamentally detrimental to our own . 
  why do n't you get that ? 
  and before you say it , we understand that things that benefit europe can benefit us . 
  but financially destroying our nation to try and appease germany is ( surprise surprise ) not in our interests in any way ( and you still have n't explained how it possibly could be ) so it 's no wonder cameron decided against it . 
   and britain should not expect any economic aid whatsoever if they keep preventing everyone else to do something about the core reasons for these crisis so britain should not expect any aid if it does n't do what the eu wants and becomes financially crippled ? 
  okay , and what happens if britain ** does ** do what the eu wants , and becomes financially ruined as a result ? 
  like , for example , ** if britain had agreed to this financial tax ** ? 
  what ** then ** ? 
  your comparison of banking to arms dealing is ludicrous , especially when you consider that it was n't so long ago that the financial industry was seen as a good thing . 
  but anyway , we seem to be getting closer to the heart of the issue . 
  you seem content to throw britain under a bus in the name of justice , but what then ? 
  does germany have a plan to help out the then ruined state ? 
  essentially knocking us down to something like ireland or greece 's level is going to have ramifications , ruining the eu 's reputation in britain for potentially decades being the least of them . 
  does europe even ** have ** a plan for that ? 
  perhaps this is why cameron refused to sign the agreement . 
  nobody at all ? 
  right then . 
   its only fair that the banks that helped cause all this have to pay their share to fix it sure , but you 'd be ruining us in the process , if we 'd have agreed to the plan . 
  financially destroying a nation is a rather excessive amount of collateral damage , do n't you think ? 
  or do we not count ? 
  i will not . 
  this ` it 's essentially like being liberated from a domestic oppressor by an outside force ' is a completely ridiculous line . 
   are you serious ? 
  you are honestly questioning that greedy banks were a major reason for the last two financial crisis ?????? 
  no , i 'm questioning your assertion that british banks were solely responsible for the last two financial crises . 
   one of the most important points about the founding of the european union was precisely to get states to act in common european interest instead of every-man-for-himself manner i agree that this is important , but i do n't see how financially ruining us is going to help us in the long term . 
  oh please , anything that is n't pro-eu gets downvoted to oblivion within minutes . 
  shall i take that as a ` no ' then ? 
   its this financial industry and its crazy shenanigans that brought us into this crisis and the 2008 one in the first place . 
  [ citation needed ]  but rebuilding a real industry that actually produces shit instead of just haggling virtual money and selling dangerous financial products even the brightest bankers dont understand anymore would be a longterm solution and accepting a tax that essentially cripples our country financially will help with that because ... ? 
   unlike any other country in the eu , britain just treats this entire project as a big free trade zone that 's how it was bloody sold to us !, 
   let me spell it out for you : the british ( and global ) financial industry is a big , big reason we are in this shit right now , [ citation needed ]  its a mystery to me how intelligent people can oppose the concept of forcing banks to help pay for the damages they helped to create in the first place you 'd be financially destroying our economy in the process . 
  you 'd be using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut . 
  killing the patient to cure the disease . 
   have fun endulging in memories of times long past when you used to be an empire with something to say in the world , give us a call when you woke up to the realities of the 21th century , do n't take too long though , or china , india , brazil and other emerging superpowers of this century wo n't give a rats ass about you pretty soon and now we get to the condescending insults . 
  why do you think cameron is going to vote against his countries interests ? 
  why are you so shocked and angry that he has n't instantly agreed to something that will completely ruin us ? 
  explain this thought process to me , because i do n't fucking understand it !, 
  can we vote for ` no influence ' ? 
  if not , then it 's not a vote worth a damn . 
  it 's just getting to choose the colour of your cage . 
  oh christ , did an 8 year old make this cartoon or something ?
