   the blog is run by the commission 's uk office aah , that 'll explain it then . 
  i feel silly now . 
  i do n't think we 'd really declare full scale war on each other . 
  at least , not for a good few generations more at the very least . 
  we 've all , to some extent , had our countries destroyed and / or occupied in two modern-ish wars . 
  that sort of thing influences a national consciousness . 
  that sounds probable . 
  if so , it 's a shameful , textbook case of confirmation bias . 
  that seems a little unfair of them , to single us out like that . 
  we 're hardly the only eurosceptical nation , and i ** highly ** doubt we 're the only one with ridiculous newspapers . 
  i 'm not sure if america has any right to call other things dumb . 
  besides , number three on this list is ridiculous . 
  has this moron never heard of translators or interpreters ? 
  because newsflash : they exist !, 
  and are employed in quite large numbers in the eu !, 
  electric cars are older than you think , they were the norm before cheap petrol was discovered in the us . 
  it 's nice to see them make a return . 
  now if we could only transition fully from petrol cars to electric cars . 
  we could then make the transition from dirty electricity to clean electricity . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mqk8u/the_united_state_senate_is_going_to_vote_on_a/ once again , i 'd have to say no . 
  well , no wrong in preparing for the worst . 
  oh yeah , we 're all just a bunch of fat , drunken barbarians over here . 
  and just where the hell are we going to find seven ** billion ** euros ? 
  god fucking dammit greece !, 
  noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo . 
  sorry , but just no . 
  britain does n't despise the euro because we 're not part of it . 
  do you honestly think the only reason we hate the club is because we 've not asked to join ? 
  that 's a bit of a strong position , do n't you think ? 
  it 's not like we 're going to suddenly go all * children of men * if the euro collapses , are we ? 
  there 's a reason it 's referred to as the torygraph, 
  i just noticed that the icon reddit gives for daily mail links is a little pile of shit . 
  clever . 
   no one wants to be ruled by foreigners . 
  funny how the dane gets upvotes for saying things like this , but when brits say it they get downvoted to oblivion, 
  the comments in this article annoy me, 
  that 's a whole 1/8 of a year though !, 
  maybe different countries have different diplomatic views or goals in burundi ? 
  the idea may blow your mind , i know . 
  and i do n't see why i 'm getting downvoted for this . 
  the link easterweekend posted partially confirms my comment . 
  how does it ? 
  is n't that how this sort of thing ** always ** starts ? 
  `` just give up your freedoms for a while !, 
  we 'll sort this out ! '', 
  and then things get worse , because they do n't and they do n't give those freedoms back . 
  have you learnt nothing from history ? 
  or are you doomed to repeat it ? 
  do you somehow believe , like those who tried this route before you , that ` this time will be different , for sure ! ' ? 
  because doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity , you know . 
  so you 'd prefer a tyranny of the majority then ? 
  i actually like the french approach . 
  at least the trains bloody run on time . 
  i was trying to make a comparison to the ` red stars ' of the soviet union , but i can see that 's gone right over your head . 
  the way you phrase it , you 'd imagine jackbooted soldiers wearing the blue stars to start marching into capitals and demanding they hand sovereignty over to brussels . 
   more that european leaders start talking about a break-up of the eurozone , the more unattractive it will become to the european populace  used as a political tool by merkel and sarkozy  they can warm more europeans up to the idea of surrendering national sovereignty to the eu this is why eurosceptics exist . 
  this is some orwellian sounding stuff , right here . 
  you 've managed to put into words what i could n't . 
  i ca n't upvote this enough . 
   i think the words you are looking for are straw man . 
  no , the word i 'm looking for is ** example ** . 
  the general idea - that having a super state will just end up screwing us all over with bureaucracy and inefficiency - applies to everything . 
   the federal government has no say in police or education in germany . 
  is it not a country ? 
  if your government has no say in how your country is run , then why do you have a government ? 
  what is there to show that you 're a unified state ? 
   why are you bringing up health care ? 
  it 's about foreign and economic policy . 
  i 'm just using it as an easy example  subsidiarity : solve the problems at the appropriate level . 
  foreign and economic policy could be handled better at the european level . 
  so then europe would n't just be one big country . 
  covered that in my reply to meteorphoenix just above you . 
  yes , they are . 
  it 's all to do with logistics . 
  let 's take a look at , i do n't know , healthcare . 
  the us could never have something like the nhs without a great deal of difficulty , money ( more money that they have , i wager ) and a large town 's worth of office workers , because american is just ** too bloody big ** . 
  it 's too big , too full of conflicting views and laws ( states are essentially separate countries in their own right ) to ever be fully united on domestic policies . 
  it 's one of the ( many ) reasons the soviet union did so poorly . 
  as you increase the amount of people and land under your rule , the costs in men , money and materials to run it efficiently increases ** exponentially ** . 
  if europe suddenly becomes one big state , that problem comes here . 
  the only way to get around it would be to let countries make their own decisions . 
  but then we 'd still have separate countries , and would n't have the european superstate so many here seem to desperately crave . 
   highly unlikely , but tomorrow , the eurozone countries could disappear and make way for a new state . 
  and when that day happens , god help us all . 
  might as well roll out the guillotine , install the 2 minute hate and be done with it . 
  we 'll inherit all the problems and failures that america has . 
  france is more ` stuck up jerks ' and germany is more ` dirty porn or nazis , both with no sense of humour ' but otherwise it 's mostly accurate . 
  culture is ** never ** an arbitrary limit . 
  culture dictates how people think and act on nearly every level . 
  thus people with similar cultures do well together ( example , england and scotland ) while people with different cultures ( example , germany and greece ) do n't . 
  and regardless of why sarkozy was angry , it still does n't excuse it . 
  he would n't dare act like that to any other leader , but britain is apparently okay to publicly slag off . 
   `` i do n't think it was . 
  i asked why was the european parliament composed of foreigners ( you 're both european and british ) , but the british one is n't ( you 're both british and english ) ? '', 
  you might as well ask an american ` why is the un composed of foreigners yet the american congress is n't ? ', 
  britain is a country composed of four smaller countries . 
  europe is ** not ** a country . 
  ** that ** is why . 
  i 'm ... actually very surprised that britain is seen as very positive . 
  the czech republic is a non-entity in britain as far as i 'm aware , it just does n't come up .
