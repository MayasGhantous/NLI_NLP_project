  what have we done for you to like us ? 
  i suppose it is partially about degrees . 
  but also that we 're a lot closer with the scots / welsh / irish than europe . 
  the lack of a language barrier helps , as does shared values . 
  also , with britain it 's all done willingly . 
  there 's no fear or precedent that the welsh / scots / irish are all going to suddenly gang up and dictate all of england 's policies ( even though they do have more of a say in our affairs than we do in theirs , due to the west lothian question ) . 
  but in europe there 's this precedent that 's started when the eu assigned the leaders of greece and italy themselves , rather than letting the people democratically elect them . 
  i fear that this sudden ignoring of sovereignty wo n't stop at the piigs . 
  to add to the annoyance , whenever our prime minister brings things up , he 's told ( by the president of france , no less ) to shut up !, 
  the fucking nerve !, 
  and i 'm not being hostile . 
  you ask a stupid question , you get a stupid answer . 
  probably because of those reasons mentioned by simongray above . 
  `` but why is the european parliament composed of foreigners but not the british one ? '', 
  because the european parliament is full of europeans , while the british one is full of british people ? 
  ask a stupid question ... edit : to clarify , it 's like if you asked ` what 's the difference between all those guys who live on your street , and all those guys who live on the other side of the city ? ', 
  we entered it on the premise that it would just be a trade bloc , yes . 
  the main issue i have with it is to do with sovereignty . 
  i do not want foreigners running my country . 
  that is literally it . 
  for better or worse , i want my country to be able to make its own decisions without being dictated by / plebian * some arsehole in brussels who 's probably never even set foot in my country outside the eu buildings in london * / plebian . 
  also , i 'm slightly infuriated whenever people act offended about this . 
  `` everyone else has already given their sovereignty up ! '', 
  they say to me with the fervour i 'd expected from a religious cult , `` why ca n't you just join in ? 
  why do you have to be so difficult ?! '', 
  edit : also , the thing that stops us is our politicians . 
  plus the eu ( and especially germany ) basically threatening us , saying that we 'll become insignificant or be ` left behind ' if we leave . 
  how can you have a liberal-conservative party ? 
  that 's like a hot-cold ice cream !, 
  shit netherlands get it together . 
  you ca n't ban drugs now !, 
  it 's called ` taking the piss ' . 
  i know , right ? 
  yes i suppose i do find kindship with other europeans . 
  disregarding the other nations of britain , the french probably come first . 
  i learnt a little of the language in school , so i have an appreciation of it . 
  plus , we 've been fighting against or with each other for over a thousand years !, 
  how can you ** not ** like a country after something like that !, 
  as for your second paragraph , i 'd like to offer an analogy : while every european country sits at a different table , they 're still all in the same restaurant . 
  america is in a different restaurant entirely . 
  well , we 've definitely lost out on this . 
  i doubt you could try justify this as a ` good ' act . 
  this is why eurosceptics exist . 
  our income inequality is n't that different from mainland europe . 
  i imagine that 's only because the other 73 % ** know ** it 's superior, 
  i assume those four were picked because of their differences . 
  a ` four humours ' sort of thing if you will . 
  i second that anger . 
  it 's the gift at work . 
  pooled and given to brussels . 
  you lose the sovereignty to decide what happens in your own country . 
  now what your people want can be overruled by foreigners , your policies can now be dictated by others . 
  `` but the reality is that it decides over 70 % of the laws that get passed in denmark '' ** how are you okay with that ? 
  ** seriously , how are you okay with the overwhelming majority of your laws being dictated to you by foreigners ? 
  how are you okay with having no sovereignty ? 
  sure , but ` get engaged ' does n't have to mean ` give up sovereignty ' i 'd rather not have my country run by brussels / berlin , thanks . 
  because we do n't want to be bloody ruled by germany . 
  so they want greater democracy ... but for each country in the eu to have less sovereignty . 
  these two things seem mutually exclusive . 
  see , now we 're getting to the heart of the issue . 
  the fact that you use the term allowed means that we would be giving up sovereignty if we switched to the euro . 
  this is my concern . 
  i worry that this loss of sovereignty wo n't just end at the euro , but will continue on until ( like greece and italy ) germany is the one appointing our prime ministers and running our country . 
  i can not abide by that . 
  i will not . 
  i would n't say it was more special than anyone elses , but it is still our sovereignty . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  `` oh everyone else has already given up their freedom , why do n't you ? 
  do you think you 're special ? 
  the thing is though , i ** like ** having british historical figures of note and the queen on my paper money . 
  what do euro notes have on them ? 
  a bridge . 
  not even a real bridge either , just some fictional bridge someone drew . 
  true , it does n't have to represent our national identity , but it does . 
  it 's part of that national identity . 
  culture aside , what do we gain out of suddenly using the same currency as the piigs ? 
  the same way you 'd lose history and culture if , for example , st pauls was knocked down for a shopping centre . 
  why should we ? 
  what do we gain out of switching to a homogenised currency with none of our history and culture in it ? 
  a currency that is tied to the piigs at that ? 
  so you do n't actually have a counter argument then ? 
  did n't think so . 
  that almost sounds like a threat . 
  serious question : what advantages will there be ? 
  what do we gain out of losing the centuries of history and culture in our money and switching to a currency that 's tied to the piigs ? 
  give me 3 good reasons . 
  because at the moment , it seems like they 're trying to con us into a terrible deal . 
  i 'd like to remind merkel that she does not run our country , and despite her apparent ambitions she never will . 
  we 're happy to work with the eu , but we do so ** voluntarily ** . 
  if they want us to hand over the reigns to some foreigner in brussels who 's never even seen the uk then , quite frankly , they can fuck off . 
  being in the eu is good for us . 
  however , we do not want to lose our sovereignty . 
  we 've fought wars for our sovereignty , and spilt oceans of blood for it . 
  we 're not going to give it up through a piece of paper . 
  [ basically ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-16544335 ) , this student is possibly ( judges have sentenced him , but he can appeal ) being extradited to the us , because he owned a website where people could view pirated movies and such . 
  the injustice comes from the fact that no part of his operation ( servers , etc ) was on us soil , and he has been charged with no crime under uk law . 
  yet our government seem to want to hand him over to america , where he will be charged and possibly spend up to five years in a us prison . 
  it 's a long shot , but i do n't suppose the eu has some kind of law or court that could be used to fight this decision ? 
  this is a flagrant act of misjustice , akin to a man drinking in europe and being extradited to saudia arabia and charged under their anti-alcohol laws . 
  inspired by the cooking topic lekotar started , i thought this would be a subject other than politics we could talk over amicably .
