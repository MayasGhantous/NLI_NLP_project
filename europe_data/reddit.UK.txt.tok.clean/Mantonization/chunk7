  europe sure as hell did n't kick that off or ` ruin the country ' through it . 
  hell , the french were keeping infrastructure damage to a minimum with concrete bombs !, 
  i 'm a little torn about this . 
  on the one hand i absolutely sympathise with and understand the want for a better life . 
  and yeah , i bet that most of them would make good citizens and societal contributors if given half the chance . 
  plus , the amount of deaths that has occurred is horrible . 
  people have the right to a decent life , regardless of their country of origin . 
  but on the other hand ( and i do feel guilty saying this ) why should we do something about people dying outside our borders ? 
  it 's not our jurisdiction . 
  and while it is awful , we simply do n't have the logistics ( nor , when it comes down to it , the heart ) needed to take in everyone who thinks europe is the land of milk and honey . 
  with these in mind , why do we have to take them in ? 
  why should we ? 
  perhaps a different approach is needed ? 
  i imagine investing in and improving north africa might be feasible . 
  not only would it lessen the amount of people wanting to come here ( by improving their lives over there ) but it would also create a new trading partner . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : i 'm having the same conflicted emotions about this as i do with homeless people . 
  my brainless heart says ` help ' , my heartless brain says ` keep walking ' . 
   whom the government does n't have good reason to believe are linked to terrorism or serious crimes this would have to be a globally accepted definition , because the us throws around that suspicion far too readily . 
  funny you say that , because my initial thoughts were to metal gear solid 4 , and the artificial blood technology in that . 
  which is funny , considering one of the biggest users of that is [ vamp ] ( http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/vamp ) . 
   if you are living in a country for two years and still cant speak the lingo , then you are probably not a skilled immigrant . 
  yes , because having difficulty with another language means that you are an idiot in every other aspect , and in no way skilled . 
  obviously . 
  and yet , america, 
  hang on , so some americans arrested a swiss guy in italy ? 
  how does that work ? 
  they 're spying on the eu at nearly every level . 
  we are part of the eu , thus it affects us . 
  also , your argument was that nobody should care about this now , because we knew about it back in 2005 . 
  why exactly should the countries who are being spied upon to such an extent not care ? 
   you americans ** u w0t , m8 ? 
  i do n't care what you canadians say , milk should n't come in bags . 
  ** then why have n't we done anything about it !? 
  ** do you agree with it ? 
  because every time someone says how horrible it is , you and others reply that it 's been going on for longer than we thought . 
  ... and ? 
  that makes it right , does it ? 
  has acceptance of previously unfathomable surveillance been grandfathered into our minds , or something ? 
  indeed . 
  the evidence shows that they 've clearly and gleefully been spying on us at every level . 
  so now they either have to : - stop the spying , or - admit that they fully intend to continue spying on their allies by refusing doing the latter will end with them losing credibility , face and trust with the world at large . 
   too bad that we germans will quite certainly be one of the last to see this system implemented . 
  \\* ahem *, 
  it will be interesting to see how this plays out . 
  though i hope that sultan ould bady is smashed , obviously . 
  what do the french public think of this sort of thing ? 
  well ** someone ** in this group of countries needs to be the token evil / asshole team mate , and by god it may as well be us !, 
  who else could it be ? 
  france ? 
  germany ? 
  pah !, 
   is there a real chance of the uk leaving the eu soon ? 
  i think this question will depend on two things : if scotland leaves the union , and how the right-wing parties ( tories , ukip ) fare in the next election . 
  scotland staying could give those who want to leave the eu the confidence that we 'll still be as powerful without it . 
  but on the other hand , scotland leaving might just strengthen the right-wing power base ( since scotland is almost universally left-wing , and removing them from the voting pool only strengthens the right ) . 
  as for the right-wing parties : if ukip has a massive support boost , then us leaving the eu seems almost inevitable . 
  the tories may be for it , but at times they seem to lack the ` damn the consequences ! ', 
  bloody mindedness , so they may not . 
  i do n't see how it 's not a comfortingly simple matter from the argentinian side as well . 
  it 's a couple of islands they have n't a leg to stand on in terms of ownership , and their governments keep using them to rile up jingoism to hide their own failings . 
  this is n't a ` both sides are equally valid ' sort of matter . 
  there 's no ambiguity . 
  you really do n't comprehend how much we like the falklands . 
  it 's one of the few overseas things has that is n't the result of horrible colonisation and indigenous displacement . 
  by sticking up for their right of self-determination , we 're actually doing something right . 
  hopefully they wo n't try pull an argentina and invade somewhere . 
  well for the first one , are you claiming that some nonsense said by ( of all people ) sharon osborne and some shitty daytime tv show are indicative of what women as a whole think ? 
  as for the second , who controls the vast majority of society ? 
  which gender has pretty much always coveted the top spots in politics , industry , entertainment , and so on ? 
  do you really think women have the power necessary to teach generations of kids to laugh at the misfortune of men ? 
  if they did , do n't you think they 'd be running things a little more directly ? 
  there was this news story from wales a little while back , about the arrest of some farmers . 
  they 'd been keeping eastern europeans as slaves on their property . 
  even worse , the police were looking for human remains because they 'd apparently been murdering them and hiding the bodies as well . 
  i had no idea the situation was this bad . 
  because , if feminists actually thought this :  in their view men are inferior or there is something fundamentally wrong with men , men are only instinct driven cheating brutal bastards while women are always victims then they would blame the victim . 
  because that 's what victim blaming is , the idea that they brought it on themselves because men are not be able to control themselves and not rape people . 
  because they ` dressed slutty ' or whatever , men could n't help but rape them . 
  however , feminism ( or at least the majority , i do n't know about every outlier ) does n't think like this . 
  at all . 
  if a = true , then b = true , but since b = false , a = false . 
  you asked me to support the stuff i 'm saying . 
  so i decided to start by backing up my claim that plspirit has no clue what feminism actually is . 
  i thought i was being pretty clear , but i suppose not . 
  sure thing !, 
  off the top of my head , let 's have a look at what plspirit thinks feminists are  in their view men are inferior or there is something fundamentally wrong with men , men are only instinct driven cheating brutal bastards while women are always victims now let 's apply this supposed mindset to , say , rape . 
  if what he says about feminists is true , when it comes to things like rape they should be blaming the victim , right ? 
  saying stuff like `` what did you expect ? 
  you went out there with that short skirt , how are men supposed to resist ? '', 
  they 'd be acting like men are instinct-driven animals capable of higher brain functions , right ? 
  except ... that 's not the case at all . 
  feminists are n't the ones advocating that sort of attitude , but rather opposing it . 
   in their view they are the ones who think men are inferior or there is something fundamentally wrong with men , men are only instinct driven cheating brutal bastards while women are always victims why do n't you go read up on what feminism is before you make an argument , because i can tell you right now that you have no goddamn clue . 
  edit : downvoted for suggesting that feminists are n't shrill harpies who hate men and think of them as untermenschen . 
   when a woman screams at her boyfriend/husband in public most automatically assume he did something wrong , maybe cheated on her . 
  yes , and who do you think has been pushing those underlying implied social characteristics since time immemorial ? 
  hint : it 's not the girls . 
  while their behaviour is appalling , they 're not indicative of society as a whole . 
  again , the vast majority is from other men . 
  and for a lot ( if not most ) of the women , the sort of thinking is taught to them by ... men , again .
