  what do you mean by that ? 
  i have seen discussions drift to jokes about / criticisms of america/ns , but i have never seen these randomly happen for no reason . 
  the original topic they drift from always has something to do with america . 
  this answer still does n't make it any less stupid , because it implies that other countries are n't diverse . 
  ` florida and california are completely different , so you ca n't judge my country ' holds as much weight as ` yorkshire and kent are completely different , so you ca n't judge my country ' . 
  drift ? 
  perhaps . 
  randomly turn anti-american for no reason ? 
  nope . 
  especially not under your qualifier from above :  in a thread about something that is in no way related to [ nationality ] or [ subject ] ? 
  side note , describing things making fun of or criticising america or americans as ` anti-american ' leaves a bad taste in my mouth . 
  it seems rather jingoistic . 
  you would n't see a brit calling other brits complaining about something ` anti-british ' , would you . 
  that 'd be insane . 
  it stands for ` in this thread ' . 
  do n't forget that ` america is the biggest and most diverse country , therefore you ca n't say anything about us . 
  but we can say things about you . ', 
   in a thread about something that is in no way related to brits or dentistry ? 
  that 's a bit of a false comparison , since i 've never really seen anyone taking potshots at americans or america 's [ thing ] , in a thread that is in no way related to americans or america 's [ thing ] either . 
  and of those i * have * seen , they 're posts made by * other americans * . 
  which renders the whole thing moot . 
   they are one of many now , not a bad place to be , among europe 's finest said nobody ever . 
  not the french , not the germans , not even us . 
  especially not us . 
   with brits , for instance , it 's `` well you were imperialist oppressors ! '', 
  `` no we gave them railways and they should be thankful !! '', 
  really ? 
  with the people i know ( myself included ) it 's generally a shameless `` yep ! '' . 
  whenever the railways come up , it 's a ` made the trains run on time ' sort of comment . 
  oh , please  hey guys , brits all have bad teeth !, 
   hey guys , the french are all surrender-monkeys !, 
   hey guys , germans are all nazis !, 
   hey guys , russians are all drunks !, 
   hey guys , the japanese all talka rike dis !, 
   hey guys , latvia has no potato , is cold !, 
   hey guys , america - ** bawww anti-american circlejerk anti-american circle-jerk !!!, 
  ** it 's ridiculous . 
  they have no problem giving it but they ca n't handle taking it , and call it a circlejerk . 
  ironically , this anti- ` anti-american ' circlejerk is much bigger than the original , if such a thing even existed in the first place . 
   the coalition were n't in power when the financial crisis hit so they can simply argue they were doing their best to cleanup the mess they inherited . 
  the question is , will anyone believe labour could have done better ? 
  but that 's the thing . 
  they have n't cleaned up at all . 
  living standards and wealth levels for the average person has decreased , not increased . 
  if that is true , how come that - despite the economy apparently improving - people are poorer than when the tories took over ? 
  ** what ** . 
  how is that legal ? 
  how is it legal for the us stopping someone in a foreign country buy something from another country , because said thing is illegal in the us ? 
  what the actual hell . 
  i 'm now imagining a future where politics is sorted space jam style . 
   but now , britain has abandoned america ex-fucking-cuse me ? 
  refusing to follow the us into yet another seemingly-unending war in the middle east is now ` abandoning america ' ? 
  are you for real ? 
   you can learn as much from what someone did n't say as you can from what he did say . 
  so what does the fact that ** literally everything on the page is blacked out ** say then ? 
   but are you also suggesting that anyone who agrees with the general point that individual was trying to make is an idiot ? 
  yep . 
  since pretty much every specific point they 've brought up is deliberately misinterpreted , ` murica circlejerking or just plain ** objectively wrong ** , i think the general point in total is also idiotic . 
  any argument that relies upon bullshit to prop itself up is almost certainly bullshit itself . 
  if it looks like a duck , quacks like a duck , you get the picture . 
   i do n't . 
  and that 's your prerogative . 
  let 's see - acts as if everything the us did during / after ww2 was because of altruism ( and not because of the soviets ) - acts as if the fact that they 've spread their culture through the world in that same time period ( again , because of being pretty much the only significant nation not destroyed by ww2 , and was bankrolling much of the world because of the soviets ) is because they 're somehow superior - saying the ** british invaded the falklands in the 1980s what the bloody hell is wrong with th - ** this is a troll image , and therefore not worth bothering about . 
  and anyone who genuinely believes in it is an idiot , and therefore still not worth bothering about . 
  i like merkel more already !, 
  if you were to look beyond the superficial , and quit with the lols and lmaos , you 'd see we 're very similar when it comes to the importance of class , politeness , ritual events , and so on . 
   same kind of world view i would disagree  same characteristics as we have in the uk ( talkative/easy going ) are you fucking kidding me ? 
  we 're not talkative / easy going at all . 
  we 're negative-politeness based , for a start , and have an ingrained dislike of the false happiness / sincerity america revels in . 
  i 'm not an anthropologist , so i 'll just have to recommend you read ` watching the english ' by kate fox , but we 're not that similar in characteristics to the us at all . 
  when you get down to it we 're either closer to europe , or to other crowded island nations such as japan . 
   americans are more similar to us in the uk . 
  we 're more culturally akin to the us . 
  bollocks !, 
  if they did n't speak english you would not be saying that in the slightest . 
  we may not always be on the same page with europe , but at least we 're reading from the same book . 
  it 's special in the same way an abusive relationship is special . 
  the us loves us , really !, 
  it just does n't know how to express it !, 
  * laughter , credits roll *, 
  a ' * petit d\u00e9jeuner avec libert\u00e9 * ' , if you want to be fancy, 
  i 'm imagining a future where each political entity in the world has its own digital cloud , protected by bother human and ai operators from foreign attack / espionage . 
  very tron . 
  being hypocritical and being right are not mutually exclusive . 
  for the sake of example , let 's say a using heroin addict tells you not to take heroin , that it will mess you up . 
  is he a hypocrite ? 
  yes . 
  is he wrong ? 
  not even slightly . 
  i ca n't really say much on the first , but i can on the second . 
  the libdems only got as far as they did last election due to things like student voters . 
  when they entered a coalition with the tories ( a red flag in itself , since they 're on opposite sides of the political spectrum ) every promise they made was either ignored , or blatantly defied ( they promised student tuition would n't rise from # 3k - it tripled ) . 
  and they do n't speak up when the tories do whatever they like either , allowing them to run the country purely as they see fit . 
  tl ; dr : the libdems pushed themselves as different , people believed them , and then they gave the tories free reign . 
  i was n't really sure if / r/europe was a good place to crosspost this , but ukip seem to be beginning to wield some clout in britain ; nigel farage is an mep ; and we have an eu referendum possibly coming up in 2017 . 
  so it might be relevant ? 
  if only in a ` look upon my morons , and despair ' sort of way . 
  ooh , i do n't really know . 
  i think we 're quite good when it comes to war , both in terms of fighting it and in terms of not liking it . 
  two continent-shattering wars tend to do that for a continental psyche .
