trump has called farage a ` friend for life ' , so i do n't think you 're far wrong . 
  there 's a george cross on their flag for a reason . 
  we buy fiats and peugeots , do n't we ? 
  i do n't see a problem with buying american if the price is right . 
  is n't donald trump enough for you ? 
  ruined ? 
  it 's a fucking pain in the arse is what it is , but my life will hardly be ruined by brexit . 
  curb , whilst the two of us would write kerb . 
   also , ** common ** ** sense ** and lack of overgrown bureaucracy . 
  well , one of my cousins is an american who thinks that sanders is a communist . 
  i think he 's joking though ... i think . 
  is n't ` anglo-saxon ' almost a dirty phrase in france ? 
  not in a xenophobic sense , but labelling something as ` anglo-saxon ' ( anglo-saxon method/anglo-saxon style etc. ), 
  is tantamount to referring to something as awful ? 
  i find it somewhat amusing ( or is that upsetting ? ), 
  that if/when putin and trump eventually meet , vlad will be the wealthier of the two ... and by quite a significant margin . 
  i do n't think the germans would fall for it twice . 
  if they found a welsh guy face-down in the spree , clenching a document titled ` brexit plan ' , i 'm sure they 'd suss out subterfuge . 
  the idea of them walking the streets of any european city is no less abhorrent . 
  hopefully the sas will return home with considerably more notches on their guns than they left with . 
  i 'm looking forward to watching the repeat . 
  well done , lads . 
  you can see your doctor without an appointment here too . 
  i recently had a problem i thought needed bringing to my gp 's attention , so visited the surgery to make an appointment in person . 
  i was offered an appointment 14 days after booking , so instead opted to wait in the reception room until they had an opening . 
  less than an hour later , i was being examined . 
  my brother is engaged to a slovenian , so there 's one to add to the tally . 
  it 's guy fawkes night . 
  i 'll also be setting light to a catholic made of hay and wood later tonight , for what that 's worth . 
  what happened in donegal ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ came ^ ^ ^ here ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ rub ^ ^ ^ salt ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ wounds . 
   yet there is a clear pattern of these `` racially alienated brits '' bitching about everything being `` too white '' , too `` eurocentric '' , too `` anglo-centric '' , whatever ... why would that even be the case ? 
  are n't those white people on your tv show your fellow brothers and sisters ? 
  why would there even be a distinction ? 
  apologies , but i do n't understand the question . 
   looking at the history of the country , the culture , the government , its institutions ... and proclaiming how it is too `` centric '' on one people rather than `` their people '' is the exact opposite of integration . 
  as i mentioned , alibhai-brown is atypical . 
  her ` quirky ' beliefs are what make her stand out and are what have gained her notoriety . 
  many ethnic indians make great efforts to integrate successfully into our society . 
  sikhs are often toted as the country 's ` most integrated ' minority group , for example . 
   what does that even mean ? 
  `` british '' is not a behavior . 
  i refer to their culture . 
  i know brits of indian descent who have very few cultural ties to the sub-continent . 
  they are only familiar with the cultural norms of the uk . 
  they are brits , like me , but with darker skin . 
  the journalist has a reputation for criticising all facets of british society , and can hardly be seen to represent the entirety of britain 's large asian community . 
  alibhai-brown is of indian descent , and by and large , ethnic indians integrate very well into british society . 
  i know plenty of brits of indian descent who are just as ` british ' as their white fellow citizens . 
  there are several differing accents within a 7.5 mile radius of my home in rural lincolnshire . 
  the dialects also differ heavily in my county , with there being no mutual intelligibility between those who speak an east lincolnshire dialect and those who speak a north lincolnshire dialect . 
  [ this accent/dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvxgc_vkmoe ) is prevalent amongst the elderly in my area . 
  there are plenty who speak a harsher , less understandable derivative , but i can not find a good example . 
  your post is just as bad as his . 
  get mike hookem to sort the fuckers out . 
  i visit my family in the united states on an annual/bi-annual basis . 
  the united states of america is the greatest country on earth , and i love donald trump . 
  i think you 've misinterpreted their comment . 
  london is the world 's premier financial centre , followed closely by nyc and singapore . 
  ` the city ' ( london 's financial district ) , as referred to in the article , has a good chance of maintaining its enviable status even after ` brexit ' . 
  i understand that the words ` london ' and ` dominate ' raise a few hairs when mentioned in the same sentence , though . 
  just another ` non-story ' to disregard . 
  `` the regulations ... they 're ... suffocating me '' he said , shrouded in a mist of chimney plumes . 
  i would imagine that a rocket of that magnitude would emit dangerously large amounts of co2 into our environment . 
  i do not necessarily disagree with this proposal , though it would only be fitting if the european union authorised the united kingdom to officially begin negotiating its own trade deals with third parties . 
  i believe it 's far too early to provide you with an answer . 
  do you have a crystal ball ? 
  that 's a lot of people to tar with the same brush . 
  i think there 's a perception here in england that a lot of scots blame us for all the rough , and praise holyrood ( the snp more specifically ) for all the smooth . 
  naturally , we overwhelmingly want to see our northern partner perform strongly , but at the same time a lot of people will whoop and holler when the snp are shown to be somewhat incompetent . 
  i would * genuinely * love to see scotland flourish , in or out of the union ( preferably in , though ) . 
  people use the acronym ` lol ' far too liberally for my liking these days . 
  that being said , i lol 'd upon discovering the person at the centre of the article was norman tebbit . 
  an entertaining little read of scarce nutritional value . 
  if they 're going to make any alterations to the passport , the thickness and durability of the cover need improving . 
  the external inscription and royal arms wear away quite easily , too . 
   french police sniper accidentally shoots and injures two people during speech by president hollande . 
  anybody else thinking inspector clouseau is behind this mishap ? 
  that was the funniest bit . 
  that and the crazy chimp-boy swinging around on the platform seconds earlier . 
  there are means and ways by which the european union could become a successfully federated state . 
  denying its people freedom and democracy would likely lead to its collapse , as has been the way with the countless authoritarian states which have preceded it . 
  i support workfare , so long as they 're not essentially working for below minimum wage . 
  here in the uk you have to perform work experience whilst you 're in secondary school . 
  i spent a week ` working ' in a job centre , which scarred me for life . 
  i met too many people who were blatantly content with sitting on their arse all day , vegetating in front of a television to think otherwise . 
  if the european union either maintains its current structure , or even pursues a path of further integration , the prospect of the united kingdom ever joining is miniscule . 
  the arguments for remaining in the european union were almost exclusively economic in nature , as conceding further political powers is massively unpopular . 
  it 's also worth mentioning that contrary to continental europe , the ` european identity ' scarcely exists in great britain ( eg . 
  the french feel french * and * european , the germans feel german * and * european , the italians feel italian * and * european whilst the british feel just english/irish ( northern ) / scottish/welsh and british . 
  i voted for the united kingdom to remain within the european union . 
  if the european union ever became a federal state , i would staunchly wish to remain detached from it . 
  a canadian would never wish for their country to become just another us state , would they ? 
  i would never wish for the united kingdom to become just another state within a european federation . 
  that depends on how the european union evolves over the next two or three decades . 
  if the european union becomes a federal state in its own right , the chances of the united kingdom rejoining , as i see it , are minimal . 
  it would be like canada voting to be absorbed by the united states of america . 
  if it were to revert to being a simple trading zone , i could see us rejoining . 
  i do n't think anything regarding the united kingdom 's relationship with the european union is inevitable . 
  in the immediate future i am unsure whether our relationship will more closely resemble that of canada and the united states of america , or that of turkey and the european union .
