  i doubt whether most people could honestly tell you which is which on an unlabelled map , though .

  i 'm not for one second saying that we behave at all ` normal-ish ' when at home , but the things i 've seen british tourists get upto in europe were pretty eye-opening . 
  we sure do ramp it up when on the continent . 
  the things i saw in krak\u00f3w will stay with me forever ( essentially british , danish , german and swedish tourists fighting it out to out-douche one another ) . 
  i hope they provide you with an answer , as their knowledge of ttip as a whole is likely to be greater than my own . 
  my personal interest in the proposed agreements extended almost exclusively to those concerning financial services , as several of my family members work in the sector . 
  trade agreements encompassing services are intrinsically far more difficult to negotiate than traditional agreements which deal only in goods . 
  that being said , ttip is/was far less ambitious than was initially set out , so i am unsure how far the united kingdom 's withdrawal from the european union will dampen attempts to include services . 
  much to the grievance of the united kingdom , ttip excluded financial services . 
  the americans wanted automatic access to british banks , but did not wish to grant the same access to french , greek , italian , portuguese and spanish banks for obvious reasons . 
  i am bloody perfidious to be fair ... or am i ? 
  satire is allowed . 
   i ca n't quite make out the one between italy and uk though . 
  a campanian flag ( albeit somewhat sun bleached ) would make sense , seeing as the site is in the region .

  that 's a falsehood , we never agreed to supply assad 's syria with sarin . 
  throughout the 2000s , the united kingdom , along with several other eu member states , supplied syria with chemicals which can be used in the production of sarin and other nerve agents . 
  these chemicals are more commonly used as post-harvest fungicides . 
  the 15 % only voted yes to be ironic . 
  my comment has bugger all to do with brexit . 
  it was not until i joined this subreddit a few months ago that i learnt turkish migrants were not all too popular across much of europe . 
  the recent behaviour of groups in germany and the netherlands in particular really does make them out to be a shower of shit , which is a sharp contrast to how i see turkish expats in the united kingdom . 
  the turks i know are entrepreneurs , hospital staff and skilled workers ( architects , engineers and lawyers etc. ) . 
  they 're as secular as your typical western european , and mix seamlessly with most other people .

  - donald trump  `` if any americans or british are watching this , think brexit or ** trump x 1000 ** '' . 
  i will bear that in mind , though our ethnic turkish population is considerably larger than our ethnic kurdish population . 
  our turks are the envy of europe !, 
  hurrah !, 
  hurrah !, 
  uk : 18.4 % in favour . 
  admittedly , far fewer uk residents/citizens were involved in the referendum than german residents/citizens . 
  it was only upon joining / r/europe that i discovered how negatively perceived turkish expats were across much of western europe . 
  we must be quite lucky , because pretty much all of the turks i 've had the pleasure of meeting over here have been pretty carefree , liberal and enterprising .

  i enjoy marmite on toast , but a 5mm coating of the stuff would turn my stomach . 
  you only need two or three pea sized amounts spread evenly to enjoy the taste . 
  much more than that and your mouth lining will peel off ( no joke ) . 
  wholeheartedly agree . 
  i 'm of the same opinion . 
  they 're often berated on this subreddit for being ignorant by europeans who are no less misconceived than those they 're attacking . 
  makes for a good laugh , though .

  i 've been denied alcohol at 24h asdas after midnight . 
  you must be a ` townie ' . 
   [ asda announces package of measures to limit access to alcohol . 
  ] ( http://your.asda.com/press-centre/asda-announces-package-of-measures-to-limit-access-to-alcohol )  ** town centre ** asda stores will stop selling alcohol between midnight and 6 am . 
  the nearest 24h asda store to me is situated on the outskirts of a small town . 
  they 'll happily serve customers wishing to buy alcohol at all hours . 
  the second nearest store to me is slap-bang in the middle of a larger town , less than a two minute walk from a dozen or more clubs and pubs . 
  they have refused to sell booze between 00:00 and 06:00 for as long as i 've known . 
  ** firstly : ** awesome , really nice work . 
  looks great !,

  maybe use ` united kingdom ' instead of ` great britain ' ? 
  it 's a * very * common mistake . 
  in what way do they think we 're backwards ? 
  lots of homes in the united kingdom do n't feature utility rooms . 
  yes , they must have changed . 
  the supermarket nearest to my village sells alcohol 24/7 . 
  it 's certainly been that way all of my adult life , although i 'm only 23 . 
  both of the pubs in my village sell alcohol from opening to closing time on sundays , too . 
  if you class them as an ethnic group than a religious group , i suppose so .

  have you visited the netherlands ? 
  i 'm 6 ' 5.5 '' ( 1.97 m ) and see plenty of guys who are taller than me when i 'm over there . 
  i certainly think they 're a bit taller than us on average . 
  i have n't heard any mention of our act so far ... but yeah , we 'll be in the bottom three no doubt . 
  forgive me if i 'm wrong , but i think you might be talking about the renault twizy ? 
  those things look like they could be a good laugh . 
   ca n't face german or japanese competition ? 
  after a little google session , it would seem that europe 's best-selling electric car is actually the ** french ** renault zoe . 
  good for them . 
  they 're all quite well built , so most people keep their opinions to themselves when in their company . 
  drivel as usual . 
  nato is the true guarantor of peace in europe , and we 're europe 's largest contributor by quite some margin . 
  they 've tried to ` recruit ' me , and they wear edl clothing half of the time . 
  there are edl members i occasionally run into at the gym who were ` remainers ' , and they 're by far the most racist and violent people i have met in person . 
  i 'd go as far as calling one of them a federalist , too . 
  as a ` remainer ' myself , the whole ` eurosceptics = evil , europhiles = good ' nonsense you 're spewing is so , so laughable . 
  amongst other things , european rugby would benefit greatly from this tectonic shift . 
  seismic geopolitical shift . 
  they said there was a small chance of europe disintegrating after brexit , but i somehow doubt this is what was meant .
