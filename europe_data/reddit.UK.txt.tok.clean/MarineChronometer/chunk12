  what was in it for us ? 
  the answer is just a single market . 
  we do n't have visions of grandeur , and we 've been our own guarantor of freedom and democracy ( with a thankful nod in the direction of the commonwealth and the united states of america ) . 
  it 's not hard to see why europe means something very different to the british and european people . 
   some are so rabidly anti-british that they are a stone 's throw away from freedom fries level of bullshit . 
  i think it 's their way of saying `` we love you '' . 
  british car manufacturers benefitted massively from foreign investment and revitalisation . 
  following its heyday in the 60s and 70s , mini struggled to make any leeway in the market until bmw bought the marque . 
  now they manufacture some of the united kingdom 's best-selling cars . 
  look at jaguar-land rover , too . 
  throughout the 90s and 00s they struggled to keep up with the rivalling german brands . 
  tata motors bought the company in 2008 , and now they 're manufacturing cars which many motor journalist say are better than comparable audi , bmw and mercedes-benz models . 
  maybe they just lost it behind the sofa ? 
  masood had a history of violence and converted to islam whilst in prison . 
  it is of course possible that whilst in prison he was also radicalised . 
  it may also be worth mentioning that he spent two years living in saudi arabia in the mid/late noughties . 
   what radicalized him , where did it come from ? 
  nigel farage or khalid masood ? 
  she thinks that ` brexit ' was an anti-globalist movement , too . 
  somebody needs to sit her down and break the news to her . 
  in europe , she 's pretty much alone in her fight . 
  i see it as a coping strategy of sorts . 
  it is far more palatable to convince yourself that a party is rescinding their membership of your group because they are in some way deficient , rather than conceding that one-size does n't necessarily fit-all . 
  i am still unsure why boris johnson was chosen as foreign secretary . 
  i have heard it said that he is very popular in certain parts of the anglosphere and commonwealth , and whilst he undoubtedly attracts attention more than most , he has an almost comically infallible track record of casually insulting entire nations and races . 
  nationalism was but one part of a complex jigsaw . 
  as disappointing as it is that a person who holds such a position of power , particularly in such an esteemed nation , would say something this undiplomatic , i regretfully believe that far stronger words will be voiced in the coming months . 
   i love all europeans ** and the english ** . 
   * ~ firm but friendly handshake , tips bowler hat . ~ *, 
  thatcher is loved and loathed in equal measure . 
  i personally believe she was one of our very finest prime ministers . 
  rarely do i hear anybody say anything faintly praising of blair , however . 
  i was being deliberately hyperbolic . 
   care to explain why every european misfortune reeks of english sweat by the time we get to it ? 
  they should n't have to explain , you 're plainly paranoid . 
  dear / u/fide _ bona , surely by now you should have learnt that articles published by the grauniad are only to be submitted if they fit a certain narrative . 
  to hell with the hundreds ( thousands ? ), 
  of articles we 've read on this subreddit in recent months which scold eurosceptics , euroscepticism and the united kingdom 's department from the european union , this is article is a mess . 
  typical anglo junk . 
  please refrain from posting material of a similar nature in the future . 
  maybe to redeem yourself you could post an article about the terrible surging suicide rate amongst fluffy bunnies post-referendum , or how our most beautiful songbirds have decided to migrate to the european union this spring , rather than the united kingdom , for fear of xenophobic abuse . 
  the point i 'm making is that i find it amusing and worrying in equal measure how rather than engaging with the article and explaining * why * one disagrees with it , people are dismissing it outright . 
  i myself voted for the united kingdom to remain within the european union , but this hostile reaction to any criticism is all too common amongst europhiles for my liking . 
  maybe british media over-accentuates euroscepticism on the continent , maybe not , but it certainly exists . 
  ignoring the issue and remaining steadfast in the face of adversity may be the manly or noble thing to do , but it 's the wrong thing to do . 
  in order for the european union to go from strength-to-strength , you will occasionally have to massage some lotion into the affected area , rather than leaving it alone for the issue to worsen . 
  cripes !, 
  it must only have been last month that deutsche bank declared the pound to be one of the most undervalued currencies following an internal beer analysis . 
  trump is a divisive character , but the strength of our relationship with the united states is such that they will clearly remain our most staunch , respected and trusted ally in the foreseeable future . 
  this goes full-circle , that 's the problem . 
  those who were affected by the terrorist attacks were n't born feeling a certain way towards mcguinness and irish republicanism . 
  i think his positive contributions to the peace process deserve recognition , though so do his darker acts . 
  no , uncivilised colonials poured their tea into boston harbour . 
  j/k milk compliments some teas , and completely ruins others . 
  ** some ** europeans , let 's stress that . 
  we 're fully aware that most europeans outside of / r/europe are far more pleasant and mild-mannered . 
  that being said , i have to laugh when a ` fuck-the-lot-of-you ' continental espouses the respectable virtues of the european union , and then says something along the lines of `` the european union promotes co-operation and peace on the european continent * , but now you 're leaving ... reeeee !, 
  we 're going to brick the channel tunnel up , shoot down your airliners , and crimson waves , dyed with the blood of your sun-seeking pensioners , will crash upon your beaches . 
  up with the drawbridge ... reeeee ! '', 
  * which it undeniably does , in fairness . 
  only $ 50,000 ? 
  our mps charge more to give after dinner speeches . 
  i have never seen brazilian meat on any supermarket counter or shelf , though argentinian steaks are often on sale at my nearest mini-market . 
  i think i 've seen chilean produce , too . 
  i have always found fillon 's policies the most appealing , and am pleased to see him performing so professionally tonight . 
  he is very well composed , and has the presence of a leader . 
  i am disappointed with macron 's performance , though he would still be my second choice . 
  certain elements may have been lost in translation , but he seems quite insincere and a little hollow . 
  melenchon surprises me ... he 's almost as nutty as le pen , but for other reasons . 
  as somebody from the english countryside , the road * makes * it for me . 
  no potholes ? 
  wtf , must take a photo !, 
  muh cape to cairo !, 
  seriously , though , not one of our most honourable moments . 
  if they 're anything like the guys i know who serve in the army , they 'll be brimming with pride having returned to their barracks with a hero 's welcome . 
  i believe that 90 % of the united kingdom 's north sea oil would fall within scotland 's eez . 
  i remember this tidbit from a documentary about the air campaigns of the korean war i watched whilst i was studying history in secondary school . 
  this would have been 5/6 years ago , so i do n't recall the title . 
  sorry i could n't help . 
  congratulations on your win . 
  i did n't have time to catch it , but will hopefully get around to watching a repeat tomorrow . 
  fair enough . 
  i seem to recall that the soviets learnt during the korean war that their asian and european jet pilots had varying dietary requirements . 
  during the initial stages of the soviet union 's involvement in the korean war , their pilots were mostly fed chinese rations . 
  after a short period of time , an ever-increasing number of their european pilots failed to return from basic sorties for seemingly unknown reasons . 
  one moment their mig-15s would be darting elegantly through the skies , and the next they 'd be hurtling nose-down towards earth . 
  it later transpired that whilst the soviet union 's asian pilots , who traditionally ate food similar in nature to the chinese rations , were able to function capably , the food contained insufficient nutrients for their european pilots , causing them to be far more susceptible to slipping into unconsciousness during high-g maneuvering . 
  the soviets immediately began to supply their own rations upon the discovery of this , and the frequency of such incidents plummeted as a result . 
  i agree that we 're becoming increasingly aware of our identity , but how is that going to lead to the scots getting ` burnt ' ? 
  going around saying `` i hope and pray scotland leaves the uk and joins the eu '' is just unnecessarily antagonistic . 
  we can all live under the umbrella of the united kingdom and enjoy unimpeded trade , but the change all of us need and want is greater autonomy from westminster . 
  i want my own parliament . 
  the kingdom of england and wales has a certain ring to it , though . 
  crooked face ? 
  that 's a new one !, 
  thanks !, 
  do you have a source ? 
  i 'm not trying to be a dick , it 's just that i heard the same mentioned on the radio a couple of days ago . 
  i briefly looked for stats relating to the english rather than wider-uk economy , but i struggled to find much , and what i did find was dated and lacking depth . 
  sorry to be a pain .
