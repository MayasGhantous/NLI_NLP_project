  during the build-up to the scottish independence referendum in 2014 , attention was drawn to the [ west lothian question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_lothian_question#developments_after_the_2015_general_election ) and the [ barnett formula ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barnett_formula ) . 
  prior to the referendum , there was negligible public awareness in england of either . 
  a lot of people down here suddenly began to resent receiving less than they were putting in , as they saw it , and were appalled that non-english mps could decide on matters relating exclusively to england . 
  english devolution became a common topic for conversation , with some even doubting whether a union with scotland continued to serve england 's ( and perhaps even northern ireland 's and wales ' ) interests . 
  if there was a referendum tomorrow on whether england should be granted its own parliament , i 'm sure support for would be greater than support against . 
  however , if there was a referendum tomorrow on whether england should secede from the union , it would n't receive much support , but far more so than it would have done had it taken place prior to 2014 . 
  the scottish independence referendum strengthened the english nationalist movement . 
  with another scottish referendum likely to take place within the next two years , the english nationalist movement could receive another little boost , and calls for a devolved english parliament will almost certainly be heard again . 
  meh , i quite like our * ` we are friends , but let 's pretend to hate each other to keep up appearances ' * relationship . 
  england ... ** emerge !!!, 
  there was an opportunity to avoid this predicament months ago . 
  will denmark , germany and the netherlands share sovereignty ? 
  fair enough . 
  my parents visit friends of theirs in rock from time-to-time , and i remember the place quite vividly . 
  i seem to recall the locals having quite a few bad words to say about the rick stein and john bray , both of whom they blamed for the commercialisation of the local culture and the burgeoning house prices . 
  i 'll take your word for it given your flair . 
  they were fucked when rick stein planted a restaurant in padstow . 
  since then , the place has become one big holiday retreat/retirement home for london 's middle class . 
  i think you are correct . 
  if the structure of the european union broadly resembles something we are familiar with today in two or three decades , i can not see why there would n't be a sizable appetite to rejoin . 
  if it came into being , i do n't think a european federation would feature the united kingdom . 
  closer union is very unpopular , even with remain voters like myself . 
  if i was a betting man , i 'd say that three decades from now a federal or quasi-federal europe will be a reality . 
  our relationship with it could be compared to the relationship which currently exists between canada and the united states . 
  we were n't confident that we would leave the european union on the eve of the referendum , so who are we to say that we will/will not rejoin in several decades time ? 
  i think a ` european identity ' would have to be fostered in the united kingdom in order for it to become a realistic prospect , however . 
  that might prove difficult given the ethnic makeup of the country is likely to change quite markedly in the near future . 
  our obligations as a member of the european union are n't rescinded upon the signing of article 50 . 
  those restrictions will be brought into place in 2019 . 
  you can say what you like about the ira , they did n't discriminate . 
  i mean , look at their victims . 
  to be clear , i 'm not seriously advocating for the body of water to be renamed . 
  there are countless capes , channels , seas and straits named after countries and regions , though i do n't believe that infers ownership . 
  this is n't just a case of the english laying claim to another slice of somebody else 's cake , as it were . 
  i own a 2011 bmw 335i and am hoping to replace it within the next 3 - 4 months . 
  i let my local bmw dealership know this , and last month they invited me to ` borrow ' a 2016 bmw 340i for a weekend . 
  the build quality has gone w-a-a-a-y downhill . 
  the newer model i tried had cheaper/thinner leather , cheaper plastics ( which creaked terribly during cornering ) , cheaper carpet lining and poorer speakers . 
  for a model with sporty suspension , i do n't expect it to be the quietest ride in the carpark , but when driving my six-year-old 335i ( which also has sporty suspension ) on the motorway you hear far less wind noise . 
  it 's a shame , because i would have called myself a bmw enthusiast before the drive , but it 's really put me off buying from them again . 
  i do n't like audi models , but i thought the jaguar and mercedes-benz alternatives were superior in most measures . 
  do we rename the irish sea , then ? 
  til my parents and norbert hofer both own the same retarded plates . 
  one of the most upsetting maps i ever did see . 
  i 'm calling it : within ten years of the united kingdom departing the european union , / r/europe funds the construction of the ` museum of british colonial atrocities ' in brussels . 
  do n't bother , somebody on / r/europe is bound to do it for you . 
  i was raised in a household which mocked the french attitude to work . 
  i then spent 102 hours at my desk one week , and it all made sense . 
  a bit of an extreme case , i know , but after a certain amount of time you begin to think `` damn , i really miss my family '' . 
  you can explore the interior on [ google maps ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.8979127,-8.4735952,3a,75y,254.91h,87.85t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1snouulbhugryc6v7vla9qxw!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  what a nice place , makes me want to visit my nearest ( and sadly , less extensive ) food market . 
  ... who helped destroy arguably the most evil man in history . 
  i apologise , i misconstrued their comment and thought they were suggesting a new location for the european parliament rather than eu military hq . 
  prague or vienna , i agree . 
  i think our high ( ish ) rating could be partly attributed to the proliferation of ` lad culture ' . 
  there are plenty of younger men who spend several hours a week lifting weights , only to hamper their fitness by drinking excessive amounts of lager whilst pursuing unhealthy carbohydrate rich diets . 
  some of us have far nicer things to say about the united states of america than we do the european union . 
   it seems to be an attraction in name only , because the flavor of ipas is volatile as hell , and there are plenty of beers made by belgian breweries that use hops that do n't taste god awful . 
  you 're right to blame american hops . 
  american ipa brewers use the same techniques as english ipa brewers , but the most commonly used hop varieties over there are heavy and musty in taste . 
  still , there are plenty of american ipas which are very drinkable . 
  our ipas , made using english hops varieties , are very enjoyable if you ask me .

  americophobia is * particularly * fashionable in some circles at present . 
  i was reminded of this last weekend when i went to a sports car event . 
  there was a special area for ferrari owners , all of whom were men in their 50s and 60s who were just one cheeseburger away from a heart attack . 
  they all had super attractive girlfriends/wives in their 20s and 30s . 
  england is bordered by nations rather than countries , but i like them both and will list just a few things i like about both of them . 
  ** scotland : ** - the scots have a brilliant sense of humour . 
  - single malt scotch whisky . 
  if it 's not scottish , do n't waste your money . 
  - the scottish highlands ( the grampians in particular ) are eye-wateringly beautiful . 
  - the seafood ( and by that , i do n't just mean fish and chips ) . 
  the waters surrounding scotland are home to some of the world 's tastiest fish , crustaceans , molluscs and sea urchins . 
  - the architecture . 
  edinburgh is n't the only place you 'll spot beautiful buildings . 
  ** wales : ** - quite possibly the friendliest people on earth . 
  great accents , too . 
  - they 've probably got the best flag on earth , as well . 
  - snowdonia national park . 
  i 've got loads of great memories in this beautiful area of the uk . 
  - welsh oggies ( ` nuff said ) . 
  - the castles . 
  you ca n't turn your head in wales without spotting a beautiful castle or ruin . 
  our government was firmly against further integration and wanted to secure further opt-outs . 
  with the prospect of either eurozone or schengen area membership being somewhere between nuclear holocaust and the black death on the popularity scales , i somewhat think not . 
  it 's worth bearing in mind that even our most prominent ` europhiles ' would be considered ` anti-eu ' on the continent , owing to their views on the aforementioned and the notion of further integration . 
  i would say that british ( jaguar and land rover ) and german ( audi , bmw and mercedes-benz ) cars are the most fawned over here in the uk , but japanese cars are respected and very popular . 
  you can not beat japanese reliability in my opinion . 
  browning 20 bore ` over and under ' . 
  mostly clays , but i 've done a lot of pheasant and pigeon shooting too .
