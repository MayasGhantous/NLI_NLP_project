  by the time i left work that day , a farmer had pulled the entire mast out of the ground ( which would have been 25ft - 30ft tall , and cemented into the ground ) , and had dragged it 1/1 .5 miles along the road . 
  that 's how much some people like that flag . 
  i understand that . 
  i have family in the us ( first and second generation ) , and they were with me when i spotted the chair . 
  they found it as amusing as i did . 
  american things tend to have lots of gadgets on them , or at least that 's my experience . 
  here 's a video of a [ ford f-650 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw3x7dsctii ) taken in germany . 
  the horn is the icing on the cake !, 
  i can see why americans own pickups , but the f-650 is just ridiculous . 
  la-z-boy furniture . 
  oversized chairs , featuring a beer cooler in one of the arm rests , a television remote holder , air-conditioning , heating , electronic massager , speakers and a panic alarm ( so you can notify your nearest and dearest if you 're having trouble getting out of your seat ) . 
  the material is waterproof , so you can easily mop up any spills . 
  i saw one in a shopping mall whilst visiting my family in california . 
  `` the veterinarian 's office was so small , there was n't even room to swing a cat '' . 
  ` room to swing a cat ' is quite a frequently used phrase here in england , yes . 
  excellent !, 
  i live in the east midlands , far from civilisation . 
   4 ) england - currently living , 1.5 years and counting hope you 're enjoying your time here !, 
  if you do n't mind me asking , are you staying in the north or south ? 
  1 ) ** uk ** ( born in england in 1993 ) . 
  2 ) ** france ** ( mainly charente ) : 60 - 70 weeks ( combined holidays ) . 
  3 ) ** netherlands ** ( mainly limburg ) : 5 - 6 weeks ( combined holidays & family visits ) . 
  4 ) ** belgium ** ( antwerp & ardennes ) : 3 - 4 weeks ( combined holidays and family visits ) . 
  5 ) ** germany ** ( berlin , munich & ulm ) : 2 weeks ( holiday , visiting girlfriend 's family & work ) . 
  5 ) ** greece ** ( paxi ) : 2 weeks ( holiday ) . 
  5 ) ** italy ** ( tuscany & veneto ) : 2 weeks ( holiday and school trip ) . 
  5 ) ** switzerland ** ( bern & schwyz ) : 2 weeks ( holiday & family visit ) . 
  9 ) ** poland ** ( krakow & warsaw ) : 10 days ( combined holidays ) . 
  this would have been 2007 or 2008 . 
  this could happen anywhere tbh : when i was at school , upper 6th form ( final year ) students would pull pranks on their last day before leaving for university . 
  one year , a 6th former brought three pigs to school , painted ' 1 ' , ' 2 ' and ' 4 ' on them , and released them in the main building . 
  the headmaster closed the school down at lunchtime so the staff could search for pig ' 3 ' . 
  sometimes the pranks went too far . 
  one year a sixth former drove his land rover through the school and got arrested . 
  i was in a pub here in england whilst the game played out . 
  there was n't a single person paying attention to the tv who ** was n't ** cheering iceland on . 
  our national team is scarcely more popular than argentina 's 1986 squad . 
  when the final whistle sounded , the room erupted with laughter . 
  `` today class , we 're going to spend thirty minutes reading from shakespeare 's macbeth , and then ** scrutinise ** ** every ** ** fucking ** ** line ** ** we 've ** ** read ** '' . 
  english literature classes almost ruined shakespeare for me . 
  i have n't been in a weatherspoons for perhaps three years , but i remember they were selling carlsberg-brand piss for # 1.65 a pint . 
  they are produced to the ` british standard ' rather than the ` european standard ' here in the uk . 
  casks and kegs are manufactured to imperial rather than metric measurements . 
  1 gallon = 8 pints the smallest kegs contain 9 gallons , whilst the largest kegs contain 36 gallons . 
  my rosbif senses ( and tastebuds ) are tingling !, 
  i do n't understand why the atmospheres at international football and rugby matches are so different . 
  i 've watched three england international football matches , and on each occasion fans from both sides have thrown things ( drinks cans , food and traffic cones ) at each other . 
  on the other hand , i 've been to perhaps fifteen england international rugby matches , and everybody is really polite to one another ( england fans buying french fans drinks & vice versa , friendly banter and people taking ` selfies ' with each other etc. ) . 
  they 're a different breed . 
  it 's hard to choose between australia , canada , new zealand and the usa . 
  if we 're talking within the confines of europe , perhaps any country with a north sea coastline . 
  i have family living in : * australia * british virgin islands * canada * france * hong kong * japan * netherlands * singapore * usa it 's bliss ; i have n't seen some of my aunts , cousins and uncles since 2008 . 
  i consider myself to be reasonably well travelled , especially for somebody in their early 20s . 
  just one of those things , i guess . 
  if i were in a room with an american and a frenchman , i 'd feel more familiar with the american . 
  if i were in a room with a frenchman and an indian , i 'd feel more familiar with the frenchman . 
  unlike you , i do n't know what it 's like to feel european . 
  i should imagine it 's nice to feel at home wherever you are on the continent . 
  geography inarguably dictates that i am european , and so far as i 'm concerned that 's where the line is drawn . 
  that 's not to say i do n't have a strong fondness of the continent and its people , but i do n't feel particularly involved . 
  i would n't know where to start in order to identify as a european . 
  even the near continent feels very different and exotic to me . 
  this reminds me of a story my boss told me . 
  whilst i was still at college , representatives from my company were invited to belarus to build some specialist equipment for the excavation of potash . 
  the belarusians had organised a day-long welcoming party , which included wild boar hunting , bird watching , and lots of vodka drinking . 
  whilst bird watching , the chief belarusian engineer asked my boss what his earnings were . 
  turned out my boss earned more in one morning than he did in an entire month . 
  crikey , i certainly can not offer a logical explanation to that . 
  no offence intended . 
  out of interest , what did you see ? 
  nah , that was me . 
  forgot to shave my back . 
  piss taking aside , my grandfather was a flight engineer in the royal air force between 1943 & 1949 . 
  he did n't see anything out of the ordinary in that time , but heard several stories about ` fireballs ' from his fellow aircrew . 
  it was assumed they were german guided-missiles/rockets , though . 
  hehe , no worries . 
  i would n't expect you to know the counties of england . 
  it 'd just be odd for you if you came to my country , spoke in a newfoundland accent , and i seal-clapped you for speaking english . 
  it sounds as though you bumped into my grandfather . 
  sorry about that . 
  one of my colleagues is from [ northumberland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northumberland ) . 
  whilst on a business trip in san diego a couple of months ago , he was praised for his command of the english language by some of our clients . 
   i 'll never forget nor forgive these people . 
  and those who support the narrative . 
  if i were you , i 'd put a curse on them . 
  chavs naming their children after a bottle of wine they saw sitting on a shelf in aldi . 
  these names scream ` underclass ' rather than ` working class ' . 
  now you 're being unrealistic . 
  probably [ rag 'n' bone man - human ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3wkzyin1yk ) at the moment . 
  in the uk it 's called ` dripping ' . 
  similarly to france ( from what you 've written ) , it 's barely eaten by anybody aside from elderly country folk . 
  i 'll let [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snou8qrelnm&amp;t=1m44s ) answer for me . 
  me neither , though i do find the dutch very easy to work with . 
  til , i always assumed it was an american series . 
  hope you have a really enjoyable stay over here . 
  where will you be visiting ? 
  i only ask because birmingham 's nec is hosting a massive [ classic car show ] ( http://www.necrestorationshow.com/show-features ) between 31/03 - 02/04 . 
  i 've attended the show for the past two years , and i 've left with a massive smile both times . 
  last year 's ford gt40 display was bloody awesome !, 
  the uk is n't * that * in favour of the eu , it would seem .
