  i 've been wanting to treat myself to a new car for a few months now , but owing to the unpredictable economic climate over here , i 'm beginning to think it 's best to sink my savings into something else . 
  i think i 'm living in a bubble . 
  i 've repeatedly read on this subreddit that the british empire is scarcely touched upon in our schools . 
  i began secondary education in 2005 and did n't go a single year between y7 & y11 without spending at least one term studying our colonial history . 
  if people are * still * talking favourably of the very grimmest aspects of our nation 's history , it would seem our history syllabi need reviewing . 
  that 's pretty shocking . 
  nonsense , have you genuinely heard anybody condone any of the atrocities we committed ? 
   the uk thinks that its nationalism and past empire were great , rather than terrible evil that hundreds of millions suffered under . 
  false , just a few dicks on this subreddit with uk flairs . 
  i acknowledged in my previous post that there are genuine victims . 
  i do n't think people who fabricate them are helping those who are genuine victims , either . 
  it sounds a little too far fetched to me , though i do n't doubt that there are some genuine fascists out there who would behave like that , despite them numbering 1 in 10,000 or something of that order . 
  i live on the outskirts of the ` brexit epicentre ' , but everything seems rather placid around here . 
  there have been a few scuffles between english and polish club-goers since the referendum , though i 'd wager alcohol rather than intolerance was the cause . 
  apologies . 
  i am in favour of a more pluralistic system than we have at present . 
  i 'm not against the nhs per se , though i would welcome a widely available private alternative . 
  i moved to private in my early teens . 
  no regrets . 
  edit : private healthcare is understandably unpopular amongst most of those who frequent this subreddit , so it 's no surprise this comment has received * some * downvotes . 
  i rely on a private healthcare provider because of numerous bad experiences with the nhs . 
  my grandmother died as a result of medical negligence and both of my parents have , at some time , both been incorrectly diagnosed with serious illnesses by nhs doctors , which as i 'm sure you can appreciate , was very stressful at the time . 
  coupled with a handful of smaller issues , private healthcare became a sensible alternative . 
  just admit it , you 're a europhobic imperialist . 
  a friendly and polite comment such as yours elevates you above the person you responded to . 
  i dislike the uncivil , pompous grandstanding which is all too common on this sub-reddit . 
  many on both sides of the eu argument are writing to one another in ways i find most immature . 
  thanks for the breath of fresh air . 
  unnerving if true . 
  the attacker was allegedly heard shouting `` i put chorizo in my paella '' , so her ballsy retaliation does n't come as a surprise to me . 
  oil prices are looking healthier by the day . 
  i know the industry is subject to massive fluctuations , but i seem to recall a senior bp employee stating late last year that the extraction scotland 's north sea oil * could * remain profitable for another 50 years . 
  i do n't really know that much on the matter , though . 
  i 'd like that . 
  :( would be sad to see you go . 
   i would really doubt that the british would apply the same logic if 30,000 russians would buy property in dover hold a referendum and declare their independence . 
  if dover had been captured by a foreign power at the turn of the 18th century and formally ceded to them by the british crown thereafter , we 'd be able to draw parallels . 
  the ` what-if ' scenario you present is bizarre . 
  if british retirees along spain 's balearic coast held a referendum and voted for their land to become a british overseas territory , neither the british or spanish governments would recognise the outcome , do n't you agree ? 
   british rule over that territory was never really accepted by spain and the spanish claims are not outlandish or extreme and i think it would be best for britain to accept that they have to deal with other countries on an equal level and not as an imperial power . 
  imperial power ? 
  what nonsense !, 
  we and spain are operating on the same level . 
  i suggest you scan the moroccan coast for ceuta and melilla . 
  i would be in favour of the government of gibraltar holding a referendum on whether the uk and spain should share sovereignty over the territory . 
  i have no doubts that we would respect the outcome of such a referendum , but being somewhat familiar with the spanish government 's approach to calls for a catalonian referendum , i doubt very much that they would respect the voice of the electorate . 
  the spanish need to come to terms with loss . 
  the union flag has waved over the rock longer than any spanish flag ever did . 
  but champagne is an english drink . 
  ** * ducks and covers . 
  * ** perhaps a fine cognac would be more befitting ? 
  it 's a self-inflicted gunshot . 
  rather than taking the bait , everybody just seems to be commenting on the appalling quality of the presentation . 
  that 's mildly amusing or satisfying , at least . 
  perhaps , though i doubt people will care as much about ethnicity as they do now . 
  is this what she meant by ` shared society ' ? 
  the scots * are * cheap and they 're proud to be so . 
  i 've never associated the scottish with stupidity . 
  quite the opposite , actually . 
  it 's red , white and blue . 
  14 \u00b0 c in my village today . 
  almost six years ago to the day it got down to -22 \u00b0 c here , and owing to snow drifts , there was 10ft ( 3m ) of snow against the east-facing side of my house . 
  i have family living just outside maastricht , so i know you have at least * some * beautiful rolling hills . 
  besides , i love the flatness of your landscape . 
  i 'm from the northernmost boundary of the lincolnshire fens ( [ typical landscape ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.059188,0.2416462,3a,75y,305.25h,84.39t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1swb-m1toqfzitbkmjancgpq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dwb-m1toqfzitbkmjancgpq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d216.32428%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) ) , so whenever i 'm in your countryside i feel like i 'm back home . 
  when you couple that with your beautiful architecture and hospitality , the netherlands is always a pleasure to visit . 
  of course we 're cool , that goes without saying . 
  those plastic paddies in boston on the other hand ... 
  sigh ... * unzips * . 
  are you competing with your friends every minute of every day ? 
  the united kingdom 's intelligence machinery is acknowledged as being the most developed in europe by quite a considerable margin , so regardless of the guise brexit takes , we will likely have the experience and resources to comprehensively monitor external or internal interference . 
  bbc four released the series [ ` bbc four goes slow ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bbc_four_goes_slow ) earlier this year . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p044g8yx ) is the 30 sec . 
  trailer for the two hour-long ` all aboard : the country bus ' , a ride along the swaledale valley ( they make nice cheese there ) . 
  james may also has a series called ` the reassembler ' , where he , unsurprisingly , reassembles vintage machinery . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03pjhw3 ) is a short clip of him working on a fifty year-old lawnmower . 
  chain owned by conceited pub chef , whose hobbies include berating 52 % of the voting public , experiences low footfall post-brexit . 
  who would have thought it ? 
  i write in jest , though i certainly agree that one should command a basic understanding of the language of their host nation . 
  workers at a food processing facility near to my hometown were required to speak lithuanian rather than english , as the cost required to provide them with language classes would have run into the hundreds of thousands . 
  this meant that some departments were staffed exclusively by lithuanian nationals . 
  preposterous !, 
  they do n't need lessons , their english is already sufficient . 
  there are some people in this part of england who are aggressively anti-eu . 
  for example , a business park located near my place of work hoisted an eu flag from their mast a couple of years ago . 
  within hours , somebody had cut it down . 
  the following day , the business park replaced the flag . 
  in retaliation , somebody pulled the mast ( which was perhaps 25ft tall and cemented in place ) out of the ground and dragged it 1.5 mi down the road . 
  anything which would suggest assimilation into the eu , like being called ` european ' , would be frowned upon . 
  there are also older people who just do n't like the french and the germans , and do n't wish to be associated with them in any way , shape , or form . 
  a sizable portion of those who live in the lincolnshire fens and wolds , particularly older people , would consider it an insult to be called european . 
  it is one of the most eurosceptic areas of the uk , however . 
  i think we got off pretty lightly here . 
  our government rejected the outcome of the referendum as the turnout ( < 60 % ) was deemed too low . 
  in the 1950s the maltese voted to join the uk . 
  a truly special little country . 
  just employ rafael vinoly as chief [ architect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rafael_vi%c3%b1oly#sun_glare ) . 
  genuinely sorry about that . 
  poland and the uk : two nations , one uniform . 
  you could start by buying me a pint .
