  ** david ( davis ) shittalker : ** no !, 
  that 's not true !, 
  that 's impossible !, 
  ** darth verhofstadt : ** lol !, 
  just like membership of the single market without the free movement of people !, 
  rekd !, 
  looks suspiciously like the death star to me . 
  as a brit , i 'm concerned . 
  it sounds as though your ` beef ' is with the romani 's rather than the romanians , though when they both hold the same passport i guess you 're right . 
  ** my caps finger is ** out ** of ** control !!!, 
  i 'm glad i could make your day . 
  please do n't cry . 
  evidently not . 
  when arrogance meets arrogance ... 
  we should plug the hole in the ozone layer with a massive steak and kidney pie !, 
  on a considerably more serious note , who in their right mind would desecrate their pie with tomato ketchup ? 
  my grandfather was a flight engineer onboard a lancaster involved in the second wave on 13/02/45 . 
  our family was affected by luftwaffe incursions , so he 's of the ` if they hit you , dust yourself off and knock them out ' mindset . 
  i would n't go so far as to say he 's proud of the bombing , but he believes it was necessary . 
  i do n't think it 'd do us ( the uk ) any harm to apologise for the severity of the attack . 
  do you have a debilitating hereditary illness ? 
  if not , would you think differently if you did ? 
  i understand your concerns , but this is a fantastic opportunity to limit people 's suffering . 
  aaron banks himself is married to a russian-born model who allegedly married a british seaman in the late 90s for the purpose of gaining permanent residence . 
  the marriage lasted just three months . 
  it 's also alleged that she has links to the fsb , but that 's a story for another day . 
  place your brexit capsule in 250ml of tepid water and then stir . 
  wait for < 18 months and then consume . 
  baffling to think poorly skilled remain voters will likely suffer from ` brexit ' in the short term , whilst more highly skilled leave voters , who regularly work in the eu , will be completely unaffected . 
  several of my colleagues are chartered mechanical engineers who voted leave , despite working on the continent 3 - 10 days per month . 
  i 'm sure they 'd pounce at the opportunity to keep these rights . 
  proof that customer loyalty does have its benefits . 
  the first sentence is undeniably true . 
  a poor choice of words on my part . 
  however , those who voted for brexit appear to be quite enthused at the idea of negotiating an fta with the usa . 
  i 'd be in favour of one , as one of my employer 's largest markets is the usa . 
  we 're in a somewhat comparable situation , the two of us . 
  however , we do actually want a fta , and we want one quickly . 
   well , germany 's railways are state owned and are generally reliable while being affordable . 
  could the same be said for the uk 's rail network whilst under state ownership ? 
  i 'm too young to remember the period , but i 've heard plenty of scare-stories . 
  i do n't think there 's much appetite for renationalisation . 
  will the results of next week 's sleaford and north hykeham by-election heal this shallow wound ? 
  vladimir putin is becoming increasingly like theresa may . 
  how so ? 
  when i began secondary school in 2005 i had no choice but to learn french and german . 
  i 'm not a linguist , and preferred maths and the sciences . 
  after demonstrating my lack of enthusiasm for the subjects , i was allowed to drop them for additional maths and science classes . 
  quite a few students followed suit . 
  only now am i beginning to regret my decision . 
  i disapprove of the investigatory powers bill , though i can not understand why the use of cctv cameras in public spaces attracts such criticism . 
  i have had property damaged and stolen , and without surveillance those who perpetrated the crimes would have gone unpunished . 
  being monitored on your property is undoubtedly wrong , but surely one should not expect to enter a crowded space undetected by eye or camera ? 
   nuke calais . 
  the french would probably welcome this constructive act . 
  they hate the place more than we do . 
  [ nigel farage is said to have dismissed reports he was planning to emigrate to the us alongside his wife as `` utter nonsense '' . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/nigel-farage-america-move-emigration-denial-ukip-leader-a7436271.html ), 
  i 'm more of a keira knightley man . 
  it 's in the uk 's best interests to cooperate and maintain strong and cordial relations with the eu . 
  a separation is inevitable , but our interests will often converge . 
  awesome !, 
  a few years ago i was fortunate enough to see a saab viggen ( a tunnan too , actually ) perform at the waddington air show . 
  it looked awesome in bare aluminium , and i was surprised by how maneuverable the aircraft appeared to be . 
  i live quite close to this static [ lightning ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.1207986,-0.182772,3a,37.5y,260.65h,89.95t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sp0wewkmuysm_kn7jkcropq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dp0wewkmuysm_kn7jkcropq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d45.705597%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) . 
   do you know where all the scandinavian comes from in your family tree ? 
  i can only guess . 
  i do n't have any scandinavian ancestors on record , but my mum 's family have lived in a village established by the vikings for as far back as we can go . 
  i think i have some huguenot ancestry , which could perhaps explain why i got a high ` french & german ' reading ? 
   you also bet me on neanderthalness you knuckle dragger . 
  i do look like i 've just woken from a 40,000 year sleep most of the time . 
  yes , these are my results . 
  i received a dna kit from [ 23andme ] ( https://www.23andme.com/en-int/ ) for my birthday last year . 
  ** paternal line : ** r1b1b2 ** maternal line : ** u4b1b * ** 100 % european ** * 62.0 % british & irish * 19.2 % scandinavian * 07.8 % french & german * 10.8 % broadly northwestern european * 00.2 % broadly european an estimated 3.2 % of your dna is from neanderthals . 
  wto rules followed by the implementation of a free-trade agreement in the early/mid 2020s . 
  i voted for the uk to remain in the eu . 
  my life was very comfortable so i did n't see any reason to vote for change . 
  however , i think it would be foolish to pursue a so-called norwegian or swiss deal . 
  we 've rescinded our right to influence the eu . 
  it 's unfortunate but that 's reality . 
  eea membership would enable the eu to influence numerous facets of british life without our approval , and as fond of the eu i may be , that 's a deal i 'd find difficult to swallow . 
  if they 'd wheeled her out during the eu referendum we 'd be in schengen by now . 
  i 'm going to have to start masturbating in public ... * again * . 
  ~ * sigh * ~, 
   britons want eu to fall just like i want uk to fall . 
  we can blame farage for this misconception . 
  despite voting to remain in the eu , i live in a constituency which voted overwhelmingly to leave the eu . 
  i 've witnessed more anti-eu sentiment in the past 18 months than you ever will , but i ca n't say i 've met many people who 'd welcome its complete destruction . 
  the buck ends with the uk leaving the eu for most . 
   it 's not like the uk is suddenly going to sink into the ocean after brexit . 
  it could if trump backs out of the paris agreement . 
  it really would n't surprise me if jim browne gets worked up about most things . 
  you 've neglected to mention that unskilled english workers are also subject to mistreatment at the workplace . 
  if you 're on the bottom rung of the ladder , you 're going to get trodden on . 
  so france did n't experience a wealth drain ? 
  could this have been a result of the improved ( from a business ' perspective ) , but somewhat controversial labour laws introduced by the socialists ? 
  hollande 's taxes undoubtedly deincentivised business and compelled many to leave . 
  he had to add flexibility to the jobs market to undo some of the damage he 'd inflicted . 
  it 's no surprise that this stimulated the economy . 
  unfortunately , corbyn has yet to arrive at hollande 's conclusion that high taxes and very rigid labour laws are impracticable .
