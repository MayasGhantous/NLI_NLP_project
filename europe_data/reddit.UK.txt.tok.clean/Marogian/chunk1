going home with an iboy is infuriating . 
  never have a fucking microusb charger . 
  hollande is the most unpopular president in the history of the fifth republic . 
  and his economy is tanking . 
  he 's in no position to get france involved , he 'd be obliterated domestically . 
  cameron is facing a general election and the scottish independence referendum . 
  post-blair the british public are * extremely * anti war . 
  you can . 
  every country knows that russia is invading ukraine but they do n't want to openly talk about it - if you accuse russia of invading ukraine there is no hope of de-escalation . 
  putin can not retreat without losing face , which he will never do . 
  that would only leave open the possibility of military conflict with the west . 
  the only hope is that everyone keeps talking about russia as if they 're behaving semi-reasonably on the basis that putin could then decide to cancel everything and because he was never doing anything to begin with he 'd lose nothing . 
  personally i think its clear that a military confrontation is the only option now . 
  that or we just let russia seize their land-bridge joining russia with crimea . 
  what a disastrous precedent that would set for [ nuclear disarmament and international law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) in general . 
  the real issue is france is economically weak and politically weak - hollande ca n't take unilateral action on this . 
  it 'd be political suicide . 
  the uk is facing an independence referendum followed by a general election within a year , the last thing our politicians want is another war to piss off the electorate . 
  and germany will never , ever start a war . 
  us wo n't get involved when the eu wo n't stand up for itself when there 's literally an invasion going on on its own borders . 
  to be honest this is partly merkel 's own making - her instincts as a leader are to always maximise future possibilities . 
  she never takes a course of action which will restrict her available options when more information becomes available . 
  but right now she faces a binary choice with no good options ; let russia take half of ukraine or put a stop to it . 
  only hope to avoid another disastrous example of appeasement is eastern europe/poland unilaterally take action and the rest of the eu is guilted into joining them . 
  what a mess . 
  ... seriously ? 
  this has positive upvotes ? 
  this subreddit is disgusting . 
  the french bank in question was bypassing us sanctions on banking for the ** sudanese ** leadership . 
  in the context of the mass killings in darfur . 
  the bank is indirectly responsible for the misery of tens of thousands . 
  they 're lucky half the board was n't thrown in prison . 
  you 're completely right . 
  clearly if the eu was democratic juncker would be the leader , but its * not * clear cut that he should have this position because the eu 's structure and treaties are intentionally ambiguous and designed to allow these kind of deals to take place which is exactly the problem . 
  honestly at this point i think the eu is probably going to fail in the long run . 
  it lacks a solid constitution to stop this kind of thing happening , and what 's more it lacks any kind of political will to create the kind of constitution which would resolve these problems because of the vested interests of those who run the organisation . 
  i 'm a pro-european federalist but at this point i think it would probably be better if we juts started again . 
  the eu is just lurching between constitutional crises and will continue to do so . 
  i do n't see how it can be fixed . 
  the interesting thing about this whole situation is the perceived democratic deficit in europe is one of the issues which really puts british voters off - you vote in an election and this should have the effect of removing the previous government if they get trounced and bringing in a new set of leaders . 
  instead you see months of horse-trading over various positions which is irritating enough - a load of invisible bureaucrats decide the result of the election - and then nothing really changes anyway . 
  ironically this is exactly what we 're seeing here , but its caused directly by the british position in rejecting what should be a straight-up result of the election if european democracy really functioned . 
  this is because the vote was never sold as a vote for a european leader of any sort here . 
  the perceived disconnect to british minds is going to get far , far worse if juncker gets in though - the `` big message '' from the election here , as sold by the media , is the rise of eurosceptics . 
  the expectation from the public would then be that if europe was democratic this would result in european policy shifting slightly in a eurosceptic ( less europe ) direction . 
  if the same old europe continues , albeit with a slightly different unheard-of guy at the head of an institution no one understands , the perception will be that the election is completely pointless and it really is just a protest vote opportunity at best , and that europe is ruled by an untouchable brussels elite as the eurosceptics always claim . 
  you could argue its the responsibility of the media to inform the public what the results of a european election should actually be , but as it seems not even the leaders of the various members agree on this its not surprising that you can then end up with different members completely at loggerheads over something like this . 
  i think most articles from the bbc on europe are pretty balanced , but they rarely write any articles of much depth because no one here gives a shit . 
  when you all live in one town its not exactly difficult to organise a protest ... 
  out of curiosity what rdbms are the nhs moving to ? 
  i found oracle 's database to be one of the few good products they make . 
  but i 'm not a dba ... 
  they were n't there in case the germans went schizo , they were there to stop the soviets invading western europe ... 
  fair point . 
  if that 's what they 've done that 's pretty egregious, 
  actually from my understanding its mostly about tuning the engine . 
  german cars have a reputation from having more responsive and faster engines . 
  that their computers were programmed to `` tune '' the engine to be slower to accelerate in the testing environments but let all the taps off in the real world would explain quite a lot of this !, 
  if you pop into an unofficial car workshop you can pay em # 50 to retune the ecu in your car to make it a heck of a lot faster , but also guzzle fuel and destroy the atmosphere . 
  i 'm sorry but i ca n't find the source - it was an article in the economist a couple of years ago discussing why germany was hesitant to enact tougher regulations on car emissions than france et al. 
  there was an infographic showing the average engine sizes of the different nations manufacturers , germany was at the top because of their focus on higher end luxury cars which tend to have larger engines , but also makes it harder to cut down emissions . 
  also , audi is part of the vw group . 
  would n't be sure - german cars and particularly vw have on average much larger diesel engines than other european cars . 
  its part of the reason they 're so popular , buts its always been a bit of a mystery how they managed to have huge ass engines which were environmentally efficient . 
  would n't surprise me if other european car companies have been playing fair , and are rightfully going to be furious about how well vw has been doing as a result . 
  if it turns out that the other large european manufacturers , psa etc , have n't been cheating over all this time then vw are going to be fucked . 
  assuming europe has the balls to properly punish one of its own companies . 
  yes it bothers me , but i think that 's already the case due to ed miliband 's failure . 
  they were already almost certain to win after the shit job ed miliband did . 
  the swings required for a labour victory are basically impossible . 
  if corbyn can win back some of the old base , give the snp a bloody nose and move the overton window to the left it 'll not be a bad outcome . 
  chuka for next labour leader and pm after corbyn loses to boris next election . 
  none of those things are his stated position since running for leadership . 
  you can bet the tories will attack him with those kind of lines , but if he makes a concerted effort to move to the centre he might survive . 
  he 's very straight speaking so it 's not going to be easy for the tories to put words in his mouth . 
  this is rather extraordinary news in terms of the uk 's political position . 
  he won with a whopping 59.5 % in the ** first ** round of the vote . 
  some facts about corbyn for the non-ukers : * background with various unions * been a labour mp since 1983 * believes in renationalising the railways * re-opening coal mines , * an end to austerity * abolishing tuition fees for university students * unilateral nuclear disarmament * quantitative easing to fund national infrastructure he 's also chair of the stop the war coalition ( organiser of the huge anti iraq war protest ) and is chair of the campaign for nuclear disarmament ( cnd ) . 
  personally i think he 's got a snowball 's chance in hell of being elected prime minister , but you never know . 
  if he moves some of his positions to the centre ground after being elected he might do okay . 
  its a bit hard to move back from policies such as unilateral nuclear disarmament though , which is not a popular view . 
  its also worth noting he 's been highly critical of nato and has indicated that the situation in ukraine is nato 's fault , which has n't gone down well in some quarters . 
  and right now he 's off to a large demonstration in central london in favour of allowing in more migrants - where i 'm headed too . 
  maybe i 'll see him ; o, 
  love that part of the country . 
  the lake district is also amazingly pretty in the winter , if you 're dressed for it . 
  have spent time there . 
  prefer london :p, 
  [ 1066 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norman_conquest_of_england ) . 
  never again :(, 
  no denying that - but the population of gays in london is fantastic . 
  its actually something approaching a normal dating pool !, 
  agreed . 
  but i 'm gay . 
  london suits me better than probably anywhere else on earth for dating and general tolerance , as well as all the other benefits . 
  personally i love living in london . 
  its expensive as fuck but its worth it , while i 'm young . 
  you 'd probably find people here would be broadly supportive actually . 
  we like you guys , 
  not really .
