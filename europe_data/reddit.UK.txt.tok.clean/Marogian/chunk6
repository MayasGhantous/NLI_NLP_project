  it would be an insane loop-hole where you could export goods from a third party into the uk , and then from the uk into somewhere else in the eu without obeying the rules that the eu wants to impose on third parties . 
  i do n't see how there 's not either a border between ni and roi or a customs border between ni and the rest of the uk , unless anyone can correct me ? 
  do n't see why that would be necessary if tm can get her associate customs status she wants . 
  theresa may spoke for several minutes in the speech about how maintaining the no-border through ireland is one of the government 's primary objectives though . 
  not sure how she 's going to manage that one , but still . . 
  you 're all placing a lot more importance on this than is due . 
  the sun , the most popular tabloid , has a circulation of 1.6 million , in a country of more than 60 million . 
  the vast majority of the population will not see a copy of either the sun or the daily mirror each day . 
  newspapers are dying ; circulation has halved in the last seven years . 
  these kind of headlines are desperate pleas for attention and the only people listening are media commentators . 
  pm says critical threat level 's operation temperer will use up to 5,000 troops to take over armed police patrol duties under police command . 
  the tories have actually said they plan to start requiring id to vote . 
  many people are against this because poorer voters are less likely to have id - they 're completely optional ( passport , driving license etc ) , are more associated with a middle class lifestyle , require you to pay to obtain . 
  there 's also i believe little evidence that voter fraud is a problem with the current system . 
  in northern ireland id is required during voting but i believe this was due to voter fraud becoming an issue during the troubles . 
  they did n't definitively say there would be no earthquake , they said there was n't likely to be one which was correct . 
  shit happens ; stop looking for a scapegoat . 
  any reasonable scientist would have drawn the same conclusion and they would have been irresponsible to let there be a public panic when there was no evidence anything was wrong . 
  if all the scientists leave italy then the country will reap exactly what it has sewn . 
  the lack of earthquakes is pretty predictable actually . 
  there wo n't be an earthquake today is a good prediction - it 'd be right 99.999 % of the time . 
  any reasonable scientist would have said that there 's a very low chance of an earthquake happening because small tremors and increased radon levels have been found * not * to be good predictors of earthquakes in the future . 
  note that the prosecution did n't claim that they categorically said there would n't be one - because that would be wrong - the prosecution 's claim is that their claims were vague and contradictory . 
  of course they were - they were asked if an earthquake would happen and there 's no evidence either way so the rational thing to do is to behave exactly as normal . 
  that is not to abandon all the buildings and hide . 
  this is a completely political decision . 
  300 people died in a ** 6.3 ** magnitude earthquake because the building codes were shite and corners were cut . 
   the seven - all members of the national commission for the forecast and prevention of major risks - were judged to have provided `` inexact , incomplete and contradictory '' information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of 6 april 2009 quake , italian media report . 
  almost as if earthquakes are unpredictable ... 
  this is far worse than if [ michael fish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_fish ) was prosecuted for saying there would n't be a hurricane . 
  hurricanes are far more predictable , this was the night before and he unambiguously said there would n't be one . 
  so ... did you make any young europeans ? 
  not really . 
  italy and greece have growth problems , compounded by a debt problem . 
  you can comfortably run a deficit for an amount of time if you 're growing faster than the interest accrues on your debt obligations . 
  i do n't mean to be rude , but what holocaust ? 
  is what franco did really considered as bad as that ? 
  as far as i 'm aware it is n't illegal for the print media to lie . 
  broadcasters on the other hand are very strictly regulated . 
  this is why even sky news ( probably the worst of our broadcasters ) is fantastic compared to our newspapers and even our best print papers ( guardian , telegraph , times etc ) are full of half truths and have strong editorial policies to manipulate their readership . 
  in barcelona right now . 
  so true . 
  bought # 30 for a 30mb/day package to use google maps but i have to be careful , its fucking annoying . 
  and i ca n't use the `` make available offline '' thing for some reason , i guess because of licensing from whichever map provider google is using in spain . 
  # 44k is an extremely high wage for the skillset . 
  for instance an experienced software developer in london would earn a similar amount . 
   this usually does n't happen , because we do n't only deposit money once we take out a loan , the actual factor is below 20 . 
  uh , no , we do - we take out a loan and then we spend it . 
  the receiver of the cash we spent the money on then deposits it in a bank . 
  or spends it . 
  whatever , it will always end up in a bank and will always be seen as another deposit ( which can then be loaned out again ) despite being a loan in the first place . 
  the reason the money supply does n't grow so rapidly is n't because we do n't deposit loans in banks but because there 's a limit point because of the [ money multiplier ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/money_multiplier ) which is essentially dependent on the reserve rate ( not the 1 % you have to deposit at the ecb ) . 
  but this does n't mean the money supply is stable all the time - its ** only ** stable if we 're always lending and borrowing at maximum capacity . 
  if we ever stop lending or borrowing at maximum capacity the money supply will decrease and there literally wo n't be enough money to service the sum total of debt ... because its all created money . 
  fractional reserve banking is * entirely * dependent on continually lending and borrowing . 
  when this behaviour stops ( kinda what 's been happening recently ) the system falls like a stack of dominoes . 
  i 'm not one of those people who thinks we should go back to the gold standard , just believe in understanding the limitations with the economic system we 've inherited . 
  there have been plenty of studies which have shown that minimum wage laws have either a negligible or a non existent impact on employment . 
  i 'm pretty sure if the us had unemployment at 20 + % they 'd be protesting too . 
  theres a huge difference between ~ 10 and  20 . 
  i quite dislike blair but actually wanted him to take on the role for this very reason : i wanted an eu presidential office which had real influence . 
  he 'd have had a whatever year term , i 'd have hated it , then there 'd be someone else of hopefully equal stature - an ex leader of another major country , and sooner or later it 'd naturally become an elected position . 
  ah well . 
  now the president is just another pointless position which seemingly serves no real purpose but to incompetently obfuscate how much of the eu is governed behind closed doors . 
  the one british guy who voted in favour is a liberal democrat ... how bizarre ... 
  that 's what the article says ... 
   i actually would n't have a problem with backing this with something like eurobonds , for this specific purpose , if the banks would get taxed jointly to pay it back . 
  what do you mean ? 
  a eurobond would be a bond issued by a eurozone government to pay for their public national deficit - public spending , but where the payment was a collective responsibility . 
  how would taxing banks pay for a bond ? 
   the future tax income would further support those bonds ' credibility this is the same as * any * tax ... all you 've said is `` issue eurobonds . 
  and tax banks more . '', 
  they 're completely separate issues . 
   also , i 'm surprised that there 's never an actual roma who speaks up in these threads , even though a person who mentions any topic on reddit can usually count on an expert commenting on it within a few hours . 
  the only roma i 've * ever * met in a normal setting ( ie not someone begging/scamming etc ) was a guy who had been living with friends for 2 years because his parents kicked him out for telling them he was gay at 16 . 
  he had no birth certificate or any of the usual stuff and was trying to sort it out with the cab ( citizens advice bureau ) and whatnot - is n't even sure if he ever had one to begin with . 
  he 'd never had a computer , smartphone or games console etc at home . 
  so i doubt there are many roma at all who are still part of their family with computers + internet . 
  oh , and he also hated that ethnic/social group about as much as the most bigoted person you 'd care to meet . 
  never heard about it - in school or in general reading/documentaries . 
  nobody would expect it ... 
  nor is the op ? 
  by more effective you mean its easier to collect ? 
  sure . 
  its also easier to defraud - claiming vat back on items which were never purchased is a massive problem . 
  its also extremely regressive . 
  lower earners will spend pretty much all of their income bar rent on vat-yielding goods . 
  high earners will spend what they like on vat yielding goods and then invest the rest . 
  lower earners pay a greater proportion of their income in vat than higher earners . 
   britain wants the advantages and privileges that come with being a eu member state , but none of the disadvantages and responsibilities . 
  no , britain wants the disadvantages of the eu to end for everyone , not to singularly not have to put up with them . 
   what britain really wants , is to go back to the ec days ( as long as the net money flow remains positive , of course , courtesy of thatcher ) , but fails to see that something like the ec is not sustainable in the current world theater without further integration . 
  again , no . 
  the british public are overwhelmingly in favour of foreign aid and funding infrastructure projects in less developer countries - what they 're against is pissing money away for no appreciable gain . 
  there are too many horror stories about crap projects in eastern europe being used to line the pockets of corrupt officials . 
   britain defines itself by being anti-eu . 
  britain wants the city to become europe 's main economic and fiscal center again , no . 
  the city ** already ** is the economic and fiscal centre of europe . 
  britain wants it to stay that way , ie not pushing all the bankers to other countries because the eu wants to impose populist taxation policies for no rational benefit . 
  why charge more tax to bankers when we could charge more to plumbers ?
