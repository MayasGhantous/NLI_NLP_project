  if you want to argue for pigovian taxations to fund bailout policies , go for it - but britain is already insisting on ** higher ** reserve ratios for british banks than europe , not the reverse . 
   , but has no manufacturing base left to speak of nor takes part in europe 's fiscal unity . 
  this is such crap . 
  britain 's manufacturing sector is second in the eu . 
  that 's right - higher than france 's , italy 's , spain 's . 
  http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/ind_man_out-industry-manufacturing-output its just not what the british tabloids like to spout - they like to go on about the decline of manufacturing because old conservatives harp back to the good old days . 
  manufacturing has reduced in pretty much every western country . 
  britain 's manufacturing sector could be better , but its hardly small . 
   britain 's eu contributions these days come down to shooting down any proposal that so much as hints to not being fully advantageous to them , and walking away from summit meetings after their `` nein '' . 
  britain is not being constructive , but harkens back to days long past . 
  financial transaction taxation makes no sense to britain - particularly when we * already * tax financial transactions more than most countries in the form of stamp duty . 
  the problem is britain wants to see policies for growth , not arbitrary taxation policies which 80 % will come from the uk and then being sent to brussels . 
  in what way is that right ? 
  it 'd be like us suggesting a tax on vineyards and then seeing what the french would say . 
   so yes , britain wants the eu to be broken and diminished in role similar to what the ec used be be . 
  you 're deluded . 
  what britain most wants is a * democratic * bloc which embraces free trade - not french style protectionism . 
  it has some strong points and some bad points . 
  best point is the uk i believe is the most developed online retail market in europe , in terms of percentage of purchases made online . 
  bad points are shitty infrastructure . 
  the reason the eu will probably never compete with the us for tech startups is fragmentation . 
  its pretty damned difficult to start a site in europe which caters to the entire european market - language being the biggest problem , and shipping etc. 
  its just a pain in the arse . 
  american market is just about the same size and infinitely easier to access as a whole . 
  i do n't think there 's any hate at all . . actually a big part of education from what i remember was the dangers of tyranny and dictatorships in general - it can always happen to you , that kind of thing . 
  there 's a very firm distinction between germany and nazi germany . 
  having said that our perspective is perhaps unique in europe in that we emerged victorious and without being totally destroyed and humiliated in the process . 
  ww2 is definitely a source of price in britain . 
  it was moral , courageous blah blah - churchill is still seen to be basically the greatest briton despite his flaws and ... well . 
  yeah . 
  people are still proud of what britain achieved , but i do n't think this is necessarily anti-german . 
  brit - its a site aimed at british tourists which spanish companies pay to advertise etc on , so mostly euro revenue . 
  i 'd suggest real ale :p you guys are sadly deficient in good beer ... i do n't know how you survive !, 
  s ` okay , i 'm planning to do a run down to spain in a while and get a stockpile of jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico while the pound is strong xd, 
  you , uh , realise this line of thought lead more or less directly to ww2 , right ? 
  my mother runs a tourist website which mainly gets its revenue in euros from spain into a spanish bank account ... she 's in the process of moving it all into sterling in britain . 
  sorry about that ... : s, 
  i read it a while ago on a bbc economics blog : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16746455  finally , and more quietly , the greek government has slashed its way to a primary budget surplus : as of now it is only borrowing money to pay off the debt . 
  that could change things quite a bit . 
  greece runs a primary surplus - if it left the euro and defaulted it 'd be able to fund itself just fine . 
  its only needing to borrow money to pay back banks it already borrowed from . 
  in effect the eu is giving them money for them to immediately pay back their own banks . 
  its a bailout of eurozone banks by the back door . 
  i think they 'd just default . 
  essex is pretty wealthy ... its just rather lacking in class . 
  speaking as an essex boy :p, 
   if you find yourself wondering , as i did , how the 50 states within the u.s. would compare across this measure of dispersion , remember that the nice thing about the united states is that baked into the first word of our name is not only a monetary union ( i.e. 
  : we all use dollars ) but also a fiscal union . 
  so ... he is n't going to show us this on a graph ? 
  because i bet the reason he 's not is its just as bad/worse ... and the he seeks to justify it by claiming a lack of fiscal transfers is the problem . 
  so uh , really what he 's trying to say is that the eu 's lack of fiscal transfers is the issue , and not the difference in the economics ... so the graph is meaningless ? 
  telegraph is right wing . 
  its about fascism and xenophobia , not economics . 
  we 'll just get right on demolishing the channel tunnel :|, 
  utter rubbish . 
  the problem is pretty much every case which ends up in front of a national supreme court is immediately appealed to go to the echr . 
  this results in a ** massive ** backlog of cases for the echr , the large majority of which are n't even admissible let alone legally correct . 
  what 's the problem with this ? 
  well apart from the ridiculous inefficiency of it all it means that people can tie up our court system for literally years at a time when , if it was n't possible for any old nutjob to appeal to the echr , cases would have been shut a long time ago . 
  we do n't want a southern european style legal system where it takes 5 + years for anyone to find justice . 
  this is all the more ridiculous because the uk has actually implemented all of the echr legislation internally already , to a much greater degree than most other signatories . 
  just because something has ` human rights ' in the title does n't mean its actually about securing human rights . 
  this is ** completely ** beside the point of issues like the echr trying to make it so that the uk has to give voting rights to prisoners - something which most liberals would agree with . 
  this is about an imposed poorly designed bureaucracy screwing up our national justice system . 
  yeah , it bothers me that there are still people in the civil service who think its correct to cover this up . 
  illegally cover it up . 
  ah fair enough !, 
  i was under the impression that a lay judge is effectively the equivalent of a juror in the common law system , ie a regular person just selected for the role at random ? 
  in which case they can be very stupid , 
  i 've done interrail from istanbul -  ... uh everywhere in between there and the uk , so that will definitely work . 
  good fun , too !, 
  my dad yelled at me during this discussion . 
  you know , i was asking to borrow money for a deposit on a mortgage ... 
  i find this rather humiliating and explained to him exactly why i have no choice but to depend on the bank of mum & dad despite having a very good job , being paid decently ... and well , yeah . 
  sucks . 
  they 've made tonnes of cash off the back of ever-increasing house prices , they hate the idea of house prices ever going down . 
  they also hate that their children ca n't afford houses without their help . 
  it makes me very angry . 
  i 'm pissing away a good chunk of my earnings each month on rent . 
  i 'd * love * to be saving it in equity in property but i wo n't be able to come close to doing that for a decade or more , so i effectively lose money . 
  to people like my parents , the baby boomer generation who make a profit just from owning mortgages on property who rent out to suckers like me who have no choice but to pay more than an equivalent mortgage would cost . 
  and they never fucking maintain the properties properly either . 
  god i hate them . 
  edit : to be positive , what we need to do : double or triple stamp duty on those who buy-to-let . 
  it wo n't affect the rental prices on those who already own property , but people will stop buying houses and flats to rent out . 
  house prices go plummet as the demand shrivels . 
  use the income to make first-time buying stamp duty free . 
  whenever i see stuff like this in other countries i feel gutted we in the uk did n't embrace the opportunity to change our voting system :(, 
  er what 's a hacking tool ? 
  as a software developer for a large company when i use wireshark to see what 's going wrong with a low level server by monitoring packets am i hacking ? 
  or when i write a bit of code to spam off loads of http packets to check the behaviour of a load balancer ? 
  i 'm not even in penetration testing and i use and develop things which can be considered ` hacking tools ' all the time ... 
  the government could make it a criminal offence to falsely claim an injury after a car accident . 
  after a few idiots get fined/community service and driving bans i think the fraudsters will stop ... 
  in the uk civil unions have precisely the same legal status as marriage . 
  the tories are doing a consultation on it right now ( the results of which were rather amusing ) . 
  i think it ought to be law before this parliament finishes in 2015 unless something bizarre happens . 
  unfortunately it does n't appear that allowing heterosexual couples to have civil partnerships is on the cards ... it may even be that they eliminate civil partnerships entirely and just have everything as marriage . 
  obviously my gay makes me walk differently \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  there 's an italian guy and a spanish guy in my development team at work - both came to the uk because apparently its impossible for them to find good work in either country and conversely uk companies are finding it hard to find good british graduates skilled in software development .
