  they both work extremely hard ( harder than most brits i 'd imagine ) and are also much better at it that you 'd expect based on their background . 
  its idiotic to prejudice against entire nations like that - they 're just going to lose opportunities to employ good people ... and gently mock amusing accents xd, 
  the uk already has a transaction tax in the form of stamp duty . 
  if any of you had actually traded on the markets you 'd know this .

  economist circulates every saturday , but it goes online every thursday evening . 
  they use the saturday as their official dates . 
  that 's not irony . 
  just saying !, 
  more complicated than that : smart borrowers purchased cdcs on greek debt , so if greece defaults they still get their money . 
  they want all their money if greece defaults . 
  have to be persuaded that if cdcs are cashed out then domino effect is bad for everyone !, 
  i think they probably should have informed the italian government first ... but i can see why they chose not to . 
  to be honest i think it makes little or no rational difference . 
  it does n't affect the outcome - if the rescue attempt had succeeded no one would care . 
  condolences to both families :(, 
  huh . 
  wow , okay fair enough !, 
  i did n't know large companies could get away with stuff like that . 
  could you explain about ` thor steinar ' ? 
  i ca n't think of any equivalent to it to draw a parallel . 
  is it * only * worn by neo nazis ? 
  how did this happen ? 
  why the norwegian flag ? 
  that 's pretty fucking ironic . 
  but why ? 
  france uses run-off voting . 
  in a run-off sarko would collect pretty much all of the national front votes anyway . 
  he does n't need to take votes * away * from them . 
  is n't this normal ? 
  i thought all countries provided lunch for students at school ... 
  i misunderstood his message . 
  it had nothing to do with the flag next to his name , but the content :  annexing the turkish part is not in the interest of the south and not in the interest of the north , but i dont see any alternative left . 
  this is what i was criticising . 
  sorry - my bad . 
  i misunderstood your intention . 
  to be fair you said this :  annexing the turkish part is not in the interest of the south and not in the interest of the north , but i dont see any alternative left . 
  which seemed to be saying `` i think the only alternative is to annex cyprus '' ... which , well , is what i was arguing against . 
  my apologies if that 's not what you meant . 
  you could just , oh i do n't know , let the people on each half of the island democratically decide which nation ( if either ) they wish to be a part of . 
  why should the island be unified if the people do not wish it ? 
  stop imposing your nationalistic beliefs on others . 
  and even then it would have collapsed . 
  and its probably going to happen again . 
  the iraq folly has made toxic any thoughts of a military intervention without the full support of the un . 
  libya has made it unlikely that russia and china are ever going to support a foreign intervention in the security council . 
  you 've got wales and england as part of the uk but not scotland and northern ireland . 
  there has n't been any real contamination above background levels in japan and this * after * the plant was hit by a massive tsunami and an earthquake . 
  if anything it reinforces how safe nuclear is , particularly as the design in japan as old . 
  any new plants would be even safer . 
  scotland makes up less than 10 % of the population of the uk ... for it to drag down the average life expectancy of the uk by a year or two its life expectancy would have to be ten or so years less than the rest of the uk . 
  find that rather unlikely . 
  you are aware that the french government controls vast chunks of huge french companies , right ? 
  like 5 % of total ( a huge multinational oil company ) and * 85 % * of edf , one of the largest energy companies in the eu ? 
  there are several others but i ca n't find a list right now . 
  that 's an extremely socialist characteristic . 
  the uk 's borrowing costs are historically low right now because the boe has been printing money and buying ** massive ** amounts of uk gilts , not because the market thinks they 're worth more . 
  it should be pointed out that ecb has also been doing this , but slightly more deceptively because they do n't like to own up to it - they 've been lending vast quantities of cash to private banks in certain countries with the understanding that these private banks will then buy their country 's sovereign debt . 
  its kinda lollerskates . 
  i wish i could print money . 
  one of the big three is european , not american . 
  its not in us interests to ` push up ' the dollar - they 're not largely dependent on foreign imports of fuel and food like many european countries , mostly manufactured goods . 
  if anything they want the dollar to depreciate to boost their own exports . 
  yes but it wo n't have any effect, 
  the first step would be agreeing on joint procurements . 
  we ca n't even do that . 
  such a monumental waste of money developing all our own stuff .

  not without more integration it would n't ... 
   the problem is the citizenry of europe wants a much more democratic eu now , but it still unwilling to surrender the necessary amounts of national sovereignty to make it happen . 
  that 's complete nonsense . 
  explain to me why the treaty of lisbon made the president of the european council appointed by national leaders rather than by direct eu-wide elections ? 
  its nothing to do with the citizenry and * everything * to do with eu not trusting citizens with this kind of power . 
  ditto the creation of the foreign service - it has an appointed head rather than an elected one . 
  explain why the lisbon treaty gave further power to the european council rather than to the eu parliament ? 
  its all about the national leaders of the largest countries retaining influence . 
  france is the most cynical about this - its primary reason for being against expansion is that its own influence is diluted . 
  why are you apologising for this blatant kind of stuff ? 
  we should absolutely ** not ** be handing over further power until the eu fixes itself . 
  i agree , unfortunately you ca n't really compete with water provision ; there 's only one set of infrastructure . 
  ditto the trains - there are no competing train companies , they 're just in different areas . 
  but studies have shown the liberalisation of the electricity market has pushed prices down and the railways are no better . 
  fuck knows which is better . 
  no , it genuinely is much less democratic than national governments . 
  for a start the nationally elected leaders have a * lot * of power . 
  far more than the parliament . 
  then you have the commissioners ; they 're appointed behind close doors in agreements between national governments , not elected . 
  then the meps themselves : the parties they belong to are different nation to nation , yet they 're aligned in groups which * again * we have no control over . 
  for instance , i 'm british and would like to vote for the pirate party , but there is n't really a very good british equivalent . 
  i can vote for the liberal democrats , which belong to one of the centre left groupings , * but * i have absolutely no control over that group itself . 
  again , the negotiations over how its run and decisions are made are all done behind closed doors and again the largest countries control the parties more or less . 
  in a national democracy you get the chance to change the direction of a party every time there 's a leadership election , in the european parliament you have absolutely no control over what each grouping does . 
  its utterly ridiculous . 
  and yes , there was plenty of reason to block the eu constitution . 
  i refuse to put my vote to a treaty which claims to be a `` constitution '' but has such incredible lack of democratic legitimacy . 
  i will ** happily ** vote for an eu constitution which put powers to the people , but the bureaucrats who run the eu utterly distrust the electorate . 
  its pathetic . 
  i 'm not even a eurosceptic , but most pro-eu people in europe treat people with views like mine as some kind of crazy xenophobic person .
