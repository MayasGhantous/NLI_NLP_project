  if the uk drops out of the eu its no one 's fault but the eu . 
  maybe we 'll rejoin it in 20 years when it finally learns that it has to be accountable to the people , but i honestly doubt that will ever happen . 
  if anything its going in the wrong direction . 
  the decision in how the eu president was chosen was scandalous ; the result of the selection even worse . 
  the dealing with the eurozone crisis is pathetic . 
  why should we surrender our sovereignty to an organisation which views democracy with such disdain ? 
  please , do n't pretend the eu constitution was going to fix these structural problems . 
  the lisbon treaty contained effectively the same structural provisions - the constitution was * never * going to fix the democratic deficit in the eu . 
  personally i 'm against signing any more eu treaties until one is drafted which fixes this , or one rolls back the powers until its simply a free trade block ( because obviously a free trade association does n't need this kind of democratic legitimacy ) . 
  i think a lot of people in the uk are pro-europe and pro-integration but pretty anti eu , and i completely sympathise : /, 
  i like the eu and want to stay in it . 
  i even like the idea of the eu becoming a superstate . 
  i ** hate ** the complete lack of anything resembling true democracy in the eu and deplore our cousins across the channel for not seeming to give two shits about this . 
  the eurozone crisis has shown that when push comes to shove the eu is really just controlled by the largest economies with the most political clout at the time and all the deals are done behind closed doors . 
  its utterly deplorable , and truthfully i want no part of a superstate which does n't respect the will of its citizens . 
  this is n't a superiority complex or any such thing : i * know * for a fact that the uk parliament , for all its problems , is at least properly accountable to its electorate . 
  the eu is just ridiculous in this regard and i am fundamentally opposed to giving any powers to a body such as this . 
  until the leaders of the large nations agree to fundamentally alter the power balance so the executive is drawn from the european parliament and change the ways the party blocks work the eu will never function correctly . 
  sarkozy and merkel should have ** no ** business deciding matters which are an issue for the entire eurozone ; they should be decided by the elected meps of those countries in the euro . 
  an executive government should be drawn from the parliament and this government should appoint ministers who have control over this shit . 
  how does it look for the rest of us seeing two people we have had absolutely * zero * influence electing controlling the destiny of the entire continent ? 
  the usa lost its aaa rating with s&p months ago . 
  the uk has n't lost its credit rating because its banking sector is both less dependent on the state and has a much lower exposure to greek debt . 
  its debt is also * extremely * long term relative to france 's . 
  check how much french debt matures in the next year ( and so has to be re-issued , plus interest ) , and over 5 years . 
  compare to britain . 
  britain has a massive advantage in that most of its debt is n't going to mature for a long time so has to issue relatively little debt right now even though its total sovereign debt is higher than france 's . 
  whichever body in the uk is responsibly for issuing gilts did a pretty fucking amazing job . 
  there 's also the quantitive easing enacted by the bank of england ( and the equivalent by the fed ) which the ecb refuses to get involved in due to germany 's demands . 
  there 's also the higher inflation in the uk meaning that the uk 's debt levels are going down by about 5 % a year passively . 
  seriously . 
  they 're not comparable at all . 
  just looking at absolute debt levels is ridiculous . 
   right after one of the best weeks for europe in ages . 
  you have n't been reading the relevant news . 
  greece is going to shit - the heavy exposure of french banks to greece is the reason for the downgrade more than anything else . 
  edit : i 'll elaborate about greece . 
  the negotiations to get a haircut on private debt has stalled completely , meaning its on track to miss its deadline for receiving the next tranche of eu aid . 
  if it misses this aid then greece will default and fall out of the euro . 
  a huge chunk of debt owed to france ( and others ) will not materialise and these institutions will then find it hard to pay * their * debt . 
  dominoes . 
  i believe certain funds such as pensions have rules written that they * have * to invest a chunk of their money in low risk areas . 
  the banks ' credit ratings have all been knocked out so there are very few places which are considered low enough risk for these funds to invest . 
  mostly that leaves aaa sovereign debt . 
  us and japan are no longer aaa . 
  of the large economies which sell debt that leaves britain , france and germany , but france might not be considered ` true ' aaa by some funds due to the outlook warnings ratings agencies have been putting out and the british market fundamentals are n't nearly as solid as germany 's ( apart from possible contamination from the eurozone ) . 
  i do n't really think people are betting on deflation . 
  its not a very reasonable thing to expect in my opinion . 
  well put it this way , they 're going to * have * to decide what their citizenry policy is and enact it if they win the referendum , so it does n't seem to me to be a stretch to offer the vote to all of these people . 
  imagine you consider you were born in scotland , raised there , but right now happen to live and work in newcastle and were denied the right to vote on this referendum . 
  then scotland leaves the uk . 
  you 've only been living in england a year so can you claim british citizenship now ? 
  perhaps not . 
  can you claim scottish ? 
  you 'd hope so - but you had * no * opportunity to vote for the referendum which made all this happen . 
  i firmly believe that all medium/long term residents of scotland * and * all those born in scotland and those born to parents born in scotland should have the right to vote in this referendum . 
  there are a ** lot ** of people living in england who consider themselves scottish and want a say in this . 
  personally i believe those who vote in the referendum should be the same group who would be citizens of this hypothetical state . 
  it makes no sense to have one group voting on the state which another group belongs to . 
  residents get voting rights on local councils , not national governments . 
  its the same everywhere in the eu afaik . 
  if the scottish government are n't capable of even defining who the citizens of their country are what hope is there ? 
  they want to form a new * nation * . 
  the most fundamental point is who are the citizens of this country . 
  citizens of a country are not the residents . 
  it should be exactly as it would be for a national election . 
  if you 're born in the country then you have a right to vote in that country . 
  if you 've lived in that country for a significant amount of time ( i 'm not sure what it is in the uk ? 
  5 years ? ), 
  you can vote . 
  seeking to disenfranchise everyone who 's moved south is insane , as if giving the vote to someone who 's been living in the country for a month . 
  that 's entirely beside the point . 
  by its very nature , this is a * national * issue , about the scottish nation . 
  in national politics expats can get themselves added to constituencies without actually being resident in them . 
  all those british expats in spain can still vote . 
  we do not restrict their voting rights because they 've chosen to work in a foreign country . 
  scotland should not be disallowing people to vote just because they 've moved . 
  and i did n't say those who are resident in scotland should n't get to vote . 
  i said everyone should . 
  resident and ex-pats ( however you choose to define them ) both . 
  no , i mean there are great deal of people of scottish ancestry , born in scotland , who now live and work in england . 
  they 're denied a vote on the future of scotland because they choose to work south of the border . 
  its extremely unjust . 
  you ca n't expect people to move back to take part in a referendum like that . 
  there 's a reason we allow ex-pats to vote in national elections . 
  i agree , that 's what 's probably going to happen but its ridiculously unjust and does not remotely represent the wishes of ` the scottish people ' . 
  the snp 's entire politic is based upon their being a separate scottish identity , yet their referendum will likely be decided not by people who supposedly embrace this ` identity ' but by those who reside on that chunk of land . 
  that peaked in 1999 . 
  its declined by about 50 % since then . 
  ca n't quite find the current oil revenues , but a few years ago they were ~ # 5bn . 
  the amount has decreased since then , but the prices may have gone up . 
  shrug . 
  anyway , the rbs bailout cost # 850bn . 
  scotland would never , ever have been able to afford it even if they 'd saved up all the oil revenue for 50 years . 
  currently scotland has a real budget deficit of about 5 % of gdp which is plugged by the uk ... there 's also the matter that scotland is not guaranteed to keep its aaa rating if it got independence ? 
  i think almost certainly it would n't actually , as part of the deal with credit ratings is historical and political stability . 
  changing so much would at least warrant dropping it a level or two i 'd think . 
  so they 'd be having to pay the interest on the deficit which atm is just paid off by the uk . 
  whatever , i do n't think the oil revenues are the killer people think they are . 
  # 5bn annually just is n't very much .
