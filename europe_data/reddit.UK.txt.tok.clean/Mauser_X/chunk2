  put them on boats and escort them to dover under armed escort ? 
  pure scaremongering . 
  bad decision in hindsight , but it was cos they wanted to break the sunni/ba ` athist stranglehold on power . 
  plus many of the senior officers were complicit in saddam 's war crimes . 
  so it made a kind of a sense to clean house and start from scratch . 
  edit : damn , got my sunni and shia mixed up :(, 
  heyyyy , you wan na you colony back , eh ? 
  we 'll split the offense down the middle . 
  the people of yorkshire ** do not ** share ancestry with parisians !, 
  * flicks ears and submerges underwater *, 
  knew this video would appear sooner or later , ha !, 
  god , what a bunch of odious cunts . 
  it 'll be a fucking awful summer for some parts of europe and possibly the entire european project . 
  morbidly interesting for those of us not directly in the path of this unnatural disaster . 
  i think it 's simply in their interests to keep the situation as violent and difficult as possible to maximise their press coverage . 
  as soon as calais calms down the no-borders guys will either return to obscurity or go protest in the balkans instead , which is far less convenient for them . 
  in short , london is the financial capital it is mainly due to geography these days . 
  and it will likely continue to be so until stock exchanges detach from physical locations and turn into 24/7 digital operations . 
  my analysis : the london stock exchange operates from 8am to 4:30 pm gmt . 
  nyse opens at 12:30 pm gmt - that 's 4 hours of cross trading . 
  that 's two more hours than paris gets and three more hours than frankfurt . 
  that 's a lot of trading time . 
  other european capitals like paris and frankfurt have better access to the asian markets , because they 're closer , so there 's more time for trading between them . 
  but considering that the american money goes mainly to london ( because of the large trading window ) , asian companies and investors looking for a slice of the west naturally choose london over paris and frankfurt . 
  the long and the short of it that london is the best place for american money to be exposed to european and asian markets simultaneously , the best place for european money to be exposed to american and asian markets simultaneously , and the best place for asian money to be exposed to american and european markets simultaneously . 
  therefore london is the great whirlpool that sucks all the worlds capital in , mostly if not solely due to its location . 
  pretty much all of afghanistan is terrorist occupied territory at this stage , with the exception of kabul and a few small hold-outs . 
  so for the overwhelming majority of young afghanis , fighting the taliban will put the lives of their friends and families in danger . 
  and the situation in syria and iraq is horribly complex , there are so many different groups fighting each other . 
  whichever side you pick , there are at least three other groups who are trying to kill you . 
  and when you factor in terror attacks and air strikes , it 's extremely hard to anticipate threat . 
  it 's all very well talking about a duty to defend your homeland . 
  but the situation is not like that . 
  there 's no virtue in fighting when the town you liberated from is last week is going to be bombed by the russians and then overrun by government loyalists with tanks who will torture you to death if they catch you . 
  i do n't think countries like germany and sweden should take in large numbers either . 
  but that 's the business of germans and swedes . 
  i do n't think europe should allow economic migrants to enter in large numbers either . 
  luckily , sensible countries like macedonia agree with us and are working to keep them out . 
  but it 's unfortunate that they consider afghanis unworthy of refugee status when they afford it to syrians and iraqis . 
  afghanistan under the taliban is a war-torn and dangerous place . 
  ok , i 'm putting my ex-forces hat on now . 
  understand that is and the taliban have a huge network of informants and plenty of what you would call secret police . 
  you do anything they do n't like , are reported doing anything they do n't like , you get a knock on the door in the middle of the night . 
  it 's not just you , your own life they 'll take . 
  it 's your parents , siblings , children . 
  so it 's not like you can easily skip town and join a militia or the ana to fight is or the taliban . 
  has to be kept a secret unless you want your entire family to be murdered . 
  those are the stakes these dudes have to consider when they decide to do something . 
  let 's just think about that for a second . 
  you 're in a situation where deciding to fight against these people not only places your life in danger , but also puts the lives of your family directly on the chopping block . 
  you 'd have to leave them behind and not know if they were being tortured , raped or murdered over a decision you made . 
  now i 'm not saying that all young men in afghan should come to europe . 
  they should n't . 
  but you 're holding the behavior of others up to a very high standard when you do not properly appreciate the position they 're in . 
  and by the way , not one of the 53 people arrested for the cologne attacks were afghanis . 
  thank you for sharing an interesting insight with me . 
  you really do n't think much of your homeland at the moment . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , are you in greece or an expat ? 
  '' ` me in kamp f ' ? 
  what 's this , a gay prison story ? '', 
  i think they could handle either one separately . 
  but being hit by both at the same time ? 
  with the way the eu are treating them ? 
  recipe for disaster . 
  i would n't be surprised if a revolution occurs by the end of the year . 
  excellently concise article , thanks . 
  if the refugees get things their way , it 'll be 3 million this year alone . 
  ok , take this with a pinch of salt , it 's just my analysis : austria has n't closed it 's border yet , but it is limiting the number it permits each day . 
  when austria does stuff like this , it causes other countries to panic and limit numbers to avoid filling up with all the refugees trying to get to austria and germany . 
  as we 're already seeing , the result is that everyone gets slowed down , forced to sit at borders hoping to be let through that day . 
  it all filters back and generally means more people spending more time in greece . 
  the biggest problem for greece is the border controls getting tighter or closing altogether . 
  that would likely cause a huge bottleneck in greece . 
  greece is already on the brink of financial collapse and lacks the resources to deal with large numbers . 
  if too many migrants become trapped in greece because of border controls , it could easily lead to a humanitarian crisis . 
  do you have any constructive advice on how we can get governments to work together to build refugee camps on mainland europe then ? 
  i 'd write to my mp but i do n't think they have any more say in the matter than i do ... 
  i did consider that but thought it would be a different offense than offending public decency . 
  here in the uk , belching in someone 's face would arguably constitute ~ ~ assault ~ ~ battery . 
  there must be more to this than meets the eye . 
  this guy did * something * to piss off a police officer and the belch was the most convenient thing to bag him for . 
  how dare ** you ** call ** me ** inhumane ???? 
  that 's it , i 'm doing the dishes !!, 
  in fairness , it 's not like i want you to gas them all . 
  here 's another comment i made :  i agree wholeheartedly . 
  i want to see refugee camps monitored by the red cross . 
  3 meals a day , heated tents and basic sanitation , school lessons for the kids , families prioritised and no right to claim benefits in the host country . 
  or some version of that , at least . 
  i think history is the biggest block to that though . 
  you can build temporary holding facilities , people are ok with that . 
  but keeping people in camps as a permanent solution ? 
  still too hitlerish for most people . 
  but yeah , obviously it 's your country , i get that . 
  deal with the situation however you see fit . 
   for anyone caught illegally migrating to europe , they get to go to jail , preferably in the arctic circle or they can do 12 months of hard labor - / u/neohellpoet  are you living in some fantasy world where any of your ideas have a chance in hell of happening . 
  this is the real world . 
  - also / u/neohellpoet you need to sort your cognitive dissonance out there , mate . 
  countries react to situations as they happen . 
  the whole `` send 'em through to germany , that 's where they want to go ! '', 
  thing happened last year .
