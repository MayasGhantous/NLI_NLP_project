  gay does n't only describe gay * men * . 
  it can be also used to describe homosexual women . 
  he 's an idiot dude . 
  do n't even bother . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's possible you were right on this one . 
  but i still saw your comment before it was deleted , and i 'm gon na prove it was you . 
  just because i have nothing better to do . 
   / edit all of us talking to you in this comment chain are the same person . 
  i just use a different account each time . 
  you fucking weirdo , there 's no way to link directly to a deleted comment after it was deleted . 
  i 'm going to do everything in my power using any undelete or uneddit sites to prove it was your comment . 
  before you peeps upvote this `` ukrainian '' here 's a link to his deleted comment where he says that he 's a german . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3zefsz/ubers_noholdsbarred_expansion_strategy_fizzles_in/cylqdti he deleted it after being called out for lying in this very comment chain about his citizenship being `` ukrainian '' . 
  i 'm not saying that `` oh , a german being a dick to poles , how typical '' but if this is n't a hidden agenda to discredit somewhat good news about poland by their friendly neighbour , then i do n't know what is . 
  hahah , he just fucking deleted the comment !, 
  jesus christ what a speglord . 
  because `` pfffttt polen '' . 
  that 's pretty much his only reasoning i can guarantee it . 
  except if i 'm working here and i pay my taxes here it does n't matter where my children lives . 
  do n't be a biggot . 
  nope . 
  just isis and 1.5 billion muslims that just fucking wont for some reason publicly denounce all those terrorists attack . 
  oh gee i wonder why . 
  maybe because most of them actually fucking agree with them ? 
  too bad . 
  thus dozen killed nearly 150 people . 
  with results of the elections . 
  you what ? 
  oh yes i am very much aware . 
  but it 's still important to say that it was n't an unanimous vote to leave . 
  every time i see some britton say `` will of the british people '' or something like that i have to remind everyone that it should say `` half of the british population '' not as most of you imply `` all '' of the population . 
  he did say `` europeans '' . 
  i know right ? 
  learn real culture !, 
  france strong ! 11 /,

  throwing away your pride ? 
  oh boy , you have some issues . 
  what you said is fucking stupid and ridiculous . 
  wow . 
  lol, 
  except you 're lying . 
  this was never proven `` fake '' quite the contrary actually , it 's been proven true by many different people posting pictures of streets and signs littered with this shit . 
  that `` irish nationalist '' sure was fucking busy , right ?

  i had a look through his twitter and nothing suggest that they are fake . 
  my entire street voted leave because `` we have to stop radical islamists coming in '' .

  this is fucking hilarious , and it 's you who needs to get some mental health help . 
   lso your english is a mess and your understanding of the data is wholly wrong to begin with ( this represents modern day data , not data back when you had 3 million jews ... ) which makes this even more embarrassing ...

  i do n't . 
  what now ? 
  where did thai thing come from ? 
  it just suddenly popes up on this subreddit and i do n't know what 's going on . 
  no need for animosity . 
  lets just wait and see . 
  we have to renegotiate everything . 
  some things wont be able to be renegotiable . 
  meaning we will most probably lose shitload of money . 
  stop being delusional . 
  hurr durr us being a part of the eu did n't help us with our economy at all !!, 
  how blind can you be ?
