  there was one such guy who we had here , i think he may even still be here , who we could n't deport to face terrorism charges in his native jordan because his lawyer said the government could n't guarantee he would n't face torture in jordan and that would contravene his human rights . 
  so british taxpayers have to pay for his upkeep and he gets to stay in this country , preaching hate and laughing at our entire nation , exploiting loop holes in its laws , and then preaching death and destruction against it . 
  it 's an absurdity and it 's about time it was looked at . 
  how is it ridiculous ? 
  he was n't born in germany , and he arrived a migrant . 
  if he was properly vetted you could 've denied him citizenship and deported him . 
  instead , he became a naturalised citizen and now he 's your problem . 
  or was , until he tried to kill a police officer and was shot dead . 
  that suggests there was an oversight in allowing him into the country in the first place . 
  it 's not directly related to the recent crisis , but it 's a poor reflection on germany 's longstanding immigration policy if someone like this was allowed into the country with open arms . 
  even if they pose a threat to your own citizens . 
  thankfully our government are now giving this particular law a reshuffle . 
  kind of has a little bit to do with the wider immigration policy of germany though , given this guy originally entered the country as a migrant/asylum seeker . 
  how long until a coach load of refugees/migrants in london end up going on hungersrike because they were expecting accommodation at buckingham palace and an evening meal with the queen ? 
  `` they lied to us '', 
  `` our demand is ... '' and therein lies a glimpse into an utterly repulsive sense of entitlement . 
  granted free travel , housing , food , and welfare in a safe foreign country , but it 's not good enough . 
  do people like that guy have any idea how they come across ? 
  it would be laughable if it was n't so disgusting . 
  you 've fled war , apparently ( do n't know where he 's from ) , and now you 've been granted a safe haven in an accommodating county - but it still is n't enough . 
  utterly disgusting . 
  i 'm sure there are some genuinely desperate refugees out there that would be eternally grateful for what he 's been given as well , and yet here he is crying injustice . 
  absolutely repulsive . 
  i understood his post , what makes you think i did n't ? 
  i do n't think it would constitute mob rule to reject someone 's case for asylum when they 've been witnessed behaving in literal mob rule , wandering around the streets with a machete threatening people . 
  i 'm sure it could be fast tracked if there were a will , and the relevant authorities could be informed terminating the application . 
  as i said , i 'm saying what i believe * should * happen . 
  yes ? 
  i 'm saying what i believe * should * happen . 
  the bbc is a joke now mate , hardly impartial . 
  very much the ` progressive ' conscience of the nation , and all news is warped to that end . 
  but that means he 's germany 's problem then , and you 'd be paying for his upkeep in a german prison . 
  and he 'd be a violent criminal upon his release back into the public as well . 
  what should happen is that his application for asylum should be rejected , with subsequent deportation . 
  absolutely laughable if a violent criminal can be granted asylum while he 's already committing violent criminal offences while he 's fresh off the boat . 
  total joke . 
  should 've just shot him dead when he approached the policeman wielding a machete . 
  one less criminal to apprehend and process , and no members of the public get hurt in the meantime . 
  alas , an opportunity missed . 
  now this violent scumbag is on the lose thanks to police incompetence , lovely stuff . 
  and if germany 's social services , police , and politicians are anything like ours they 'll actively cover it up for years , and avoid combatting it , or even simply addressing it , out of fear of harming ` community relations ' or ` appearing racist ' . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  i know this , as i mentioned earlier to another poster , but afghanistan is not comparable to syria . 
  there are the same old struggles with the taliban that there have always been , but the country 's major cities are relatively safe and prosperous , that is not the case for syria . 
  if someone was from a region which was in an area being contested by security forces and the taliban , why would n't they simply flee to the major cities in their own country for refuge rather than almost half way across the globe ? 
  these people are economic migrants mate , let 's be frank . 
  there are probably some among them who have legitimate cases for asylum given individual persecution , but most will be migrants . 
  it was not a pointless war . 
  it was a valid one to destroy aq 's bases within the country which they 'd used to train terrorist prior to 9/11 . 
  what followed was the removal of their ally in the taliban so they could n't use the country as a base of operations against the u.s. / europe again , and so that the country could be secure and prosperous . 
  the following 14 years in the country were to keep the taliban at bay and grant afghans the closest thing they could manage to a genuine democracy , to build up a national police force and army from the very ground up . 
  it was the responsible , and right thing to do . 
  it was an absolutely enormous task however , and proved a very difficult one . 
  but to describe it as a ` pointless ' war is simply untrue . 
  no , i 'm not actually , you 're wrong . 
  there 's been the same old struggle for influence and power with the taliban that there 's always been , but there is no active war . 
  certainly not comparable to syria , however which way you try and define it . 
  the country 's major cities are relatively secure and prosperous , this certainly is n't the case for syria . 
  the vast majority of the people leaving afghanistan for europe will be economic migrants , very few will be seeking genuine asylum , and even fewer still will be refugees . 
  as i 've said , much of the country is free and secure , if someone inhabited a dangerous part of said country , why not move to a more secure and safe part to seek refuge within your own country - rather than travelling almost half way across the globe for it ? 
  these people are migrants . 
  and this is n't a fitting comparison to syria . 
  nail  head . 
   the idea that this is a one-sided issue is simply inaccurate , and imho race is irrelevant to tackling the problem  unfortunately concepts like `` disproportionate '' rely on the ability to make accurate comparisons , where none are possible since child abuse even within the uk is so heavily underreported . 
  you 're talking shite mate . 
  typical ` progressive ' shite to be expected from a lefty who has a biological aversion to discussions about race or religion in fact . 
  this is a specific issue , and it * is * one in which race/culture/religion is relevant . 
  now you 're right to point out that this is convenient to the far right , but that does n't change reality . 
  and you should n't resort to whataboutisms in attempts to gloss over a very serious and specific issue just because you 're uncomfortable with the reflections on the relevance of race in these particular crimes . 
  south east asian muslim men are overwhelmingly represented among those convicted of what ceop describes as ` type 1 ' offenders , this is objective fact :  the child exploitation and online protection centre ( ceop ) -- the national anti-paedophile police command -- divides networks of sex offenders into two groups . 
   so-called `` type 1 offenders '' target young people `` on the basis of their vulnerability , rather than as a result of a specific preferential sexual interest in children '' . 
   ceop received intelligence from 31 out of 43 police forces on groups like this who were known or suspected to have abused vulnerable children in 2012 . 
   there were 57 such groups , ranging from two to 25 suspects , on the radar of those 31 constabularies . 
  we do n't know if any have now been convicted . 
  ... ...  in 2011 the times journalist andrew norfolk identified 17 cases that had led to convictions where there had been a similar pattern of grooming . 
   in all cases , the victims were vulnerable teenage girls , often in the care of social services . 
  they were approached on the street by men , befriended and plied with alcohol or drugs , before being sexually abused . 
   updating the list to include more recent convictions that fit the same pattern , we find that there have been at least 27 similar cases in the last decade . 
   by date of conviction , we have evidence of such exploitation taking place in keighley ( 2005 and 2013 ) , blackpool ( 2006 ) , oldham ( 2007 and 2008 ) , blackburn ( 2007 , 2008 and 2009 ) , sheffield ( 2008 ) , manchester ( 2008 and 2013 ) skipton ( 2009 ) , rochdale ( two cases in 2010 , one in 2012 and another in 2013 ) , nelson ( 2010 ) , preston ( 2010 ) rotherham ( 2010 ) derby ( 2010 ) , telford ( 2012 ) , bradford ( 2012 ) , ipswich ( 2013 ) , birmingham ( 2013 ) , oxford ( 2013 ) , barking ( 2013 ) and peterborough ( 2013 ) . 
   this is based on a trawl of news sources so is almost certainly incomplete . 
   the jay report into failings in rotherham says : ** `` by far the majority of perpetrators were described as asian by victims ** , yet throughout the entire period , councillors did not engage directly with the pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue . 
   `` some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem , which they hoped would go away . 
  several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist ; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so . '' * several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist * - this particular quote is pertinent to people like yourself , and is something you should reflect on , as a matter of urgency . 
   ceop data about the ethnicity of offenders and suspects identified by those 31 police forces in 2012 is incomplete . 
   the unit says : `` all ethnicities were represented in the sample . 
  however , ** a disproportionate number of offenders were reported as asian ** . ''  of 52 groups where ethnicity data was provided , 26 ** ( 50 per cent ) comprised all asian offenders ** , 11 ( 21 per cent ) were all white , 9 ( 17 per cent ) groups had offenders from multiple ethnicities , 4 ( 8 per cent ) were all black offenders and there were 2 ( 4 per cent ) exclusively arab groups . 
   of the 306 offenders whose ethnicity was noted , ** 75 per cent were categorised as asian ** , 17 per cent white , and the remaining 8 per cent black ( 5 per cent ) or arab ( 3 per cent ) . 
   ceop identified 144 victims of the type 1 groups . 
  again , the data was incomplete . 
  gender was mentioned in 118 cases . 
  all were female . 
  some ** 97 per cent of victims were white ** . 
   girls aged between 14 and 15 accounted for 57 per cent of victims . 
  out of 144 girls , 100 had `` at least one identifiable vulnerability '' like alcohol or drug problems , mental health issues or a history of going missing . 
  more than half of the victims were in local authority care . 
   the 27 court cases that we found led to the convictions of 92 men . 
  ** some 79 ( 87 per cent ) were reported as being of south asian muslim origin ** . 
   three were white britons , two were indian , three were iraqi kurds , four were eastern european roma and one was a congolese refugee , according to reports of the trials . 
  ...  sentencing nine men in 2012 over offences in rochdale , judge gerald clifton told the defendants they had treated their victims `` as though they were worthless and beyond all respect '' , adding : ** `` i believe that one of the factors that led to that was that they were not of your community or religion . '' **  one of the victims of the oxford gang told the guardian that her abusers had asked her to recruit other teenagers and ** `` specified that they wanted only white girls '' ** .
