  and only an apologist would cite other offences/offenders when the magnifying glass is on this very specific issue of type 1 offenders in the uk , only an apologist would seek to gloss over this issue with pathetic and entirely transparent whataboutisms . 
  i hope you 're merely one of those people who has a cowardly reticence to reflect upon the racial aspect of these crimes , rather than an active apologist however . 
  still no defence however , none whatsoever . 
  as it 's exactly this kind of cowardice that led to thousands of young girls in this country being raped over a period of years , and their attackers going unchallenged for years . 
  it 's a national disgrace that it was allowed to continue unchallenged for so long due to that very cowardice . 
  it 's anger about this which has fuelled the rise of the far right in this country , and that 's bad for everyone . 
  what kind of state are we in when the only people willing to talk about this are the fucking far right ? 
  the real way to turn people away from hate and far right groups is not to pretend there is n't a racial issue , because everyone can see it is , especially people living in those very towns in which it was rampant . 
  the way to do it is reflect on those uncomfortable truths , and try to address their causes , whatever they are . 
  for everyone on all sides of the political divide to recognise this is an issue , and to make sure that it can never , ever , happen again . 
  this is fundamental to ensuring it is tackled wherever it may still exist , and to eradicate it once and for all . 
  it 's imperative that everyone does this , for the health and prosperity of the entire country and its future ; to ensure that extremists on whatever political divide can not exploit it to serve their own poisonous agendas . 
  it must be stamped out , and we all must be together in making sure that it is . 
  just saw itv news earlier tonight , the journalist doing the report was on the greek island of lesbos , as he was there a boat came to the shore full of what he thought were refugees . . 
  turns out every single one of them were afghans . 
  he verbatim said that they were all afghans ( after making a point of welcoming them to europe ) . 
  can someone tell me how on earth there are so many afghans migrating to europe ? 
  why ? 
  the sheer distance , and there is no active war at present in the country . 
  these people are economic migrants . 
  and they will be amongst genuine refugees from syria . 
  there have been clear reports of economic migrants pretending to be syrian also . 
  how is the eu going to be expected to distinguish between the migrants and the refugees when so many travel without identification and lie about why they 're there ? 
  the whole situation just seems an absolute shambles . 
  it 's going to cost the eu billions to sort through all the people , to process them , how can that be justified when so many eu countries are under strict austerity measures dictated to them by germany . . 
  the same country that has now opened up the eu 's borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees and will expect these very countries to take the economic burden of these people as part of the union ? 
  absolute joke as far as i 'm concerned . 
  the sooner we get that vote on the eu in/out referendum the better . 
  leave germany to dictate the hippy utopia to the other meek countries in dire financial straits , who ca n't even look after their own citizens . 
  shambles . 
  it 's hyperbole to say ` most ' , but some certainly will be , you 'd be naive to think otherwise . 
  a vast amount of the people making the journey are deliberately travelling without identification as well . 
  it 's impossible to know who these people are , or what their criminal records are . 
  also have to wonder how many of these people would be sympathetic to is 's cause . 
  ` progessives ' are their vanguard : legitimising their victim complex , legitimising their persecution complex , validating them in blaming all culpability for these kind of acts away from central things like extreme religious beliefs/political extremism and all at the feet of the big bad ` western governments ' . 
  it 's always someone else 's fault . 
  it 's that pathetic narrative which perpetuates the violence and extremism . 
  there 's never an honest analysis of this kind of violent extremism with many on the left , and they often completely unironically side themselves with islamists in their response to these kind of attacks in their desire to distance themselves from the reactionaries on the right . 
  the whole political narrative around this topic is pathetic . 
  and it 's characterised by extreme cowardice and dishonesty . 
  it 's either appease , appease , appease , or deport , deport , deport . 
  the debate is dominated by morons and that 's because of the cowardice of the mainstream , imo . 
  more like : ** merkel ** : '' * i 'll take the lead , i 'll decide what 's best for the union , and all your individual countries , you do n't like it ? 
  tough shit . 
  * '' ** europeans ** : '' * booo !, 
  dictator !, 
  we 're not federal vessel states in an eu dictatorship led by merkel and unelected bureaucrats in brussels , we 're independent sovereign nations who demand our own say in this crisis !, 
  * '' ** merkel ** : '' * the terms of the eu are not negotiable , i 'm taking the lead again !, 
  it 's best for everyone !, 
  * '' ** turkey ** : '' * well said !, 
   beside that , i have never heard in any media , that american , australian or german immigrants are causing any major trouble in uk . 
  most incidents i heard of were caused by a certain nationality . 
  just think of rotherham ... 
  i know all that mate , i 'm not disputing that . 
  not all immigration is equal . 
  i was disputing his point that leaving the eu would still leave us subject to casual commonwealth immigration . 
  and i do n't think that 's true . 
  i think a lot of that is historical immigration , policies change , but i 'd love to see some actual numbers on it , and how easy/difficult it is to immigrate from those nations to britain . 
   unrelated medical issues i.e being a fat fuck ? 
  was effectively the point of my comment . 
   not an open door but it makes it easier to apply for uk citizenship being a commonwealth citizen . 
  all very vague . 
  you ca n't just fly into britain as a citizen of a nation that used to be part of the commonwealth without a visa , and then bish bash bosh you have british citizenship . 
   besides , if it is n't the commonwealth allowing pakistanis , bangladeshis and indians into the uk so freely then what is it ? 
  it 's certainly not the eu since they have nothing to do with it . 
  i do n't know . 
  you 're the one speaking like an authority on the subject . 
  can you provide any actual figures , or anything at all to use as a citation , to support your claim re immigration from nations which used to be part of the commonwealth ? 
  your implication seems to be that there 's more or less an open door to anyone from the commonwealth , and that patently is n't true . 
   if the pregnancy is discovered past the legal time frame for abortion you can legally get an abortion up to 24 weeks from conception . 
  if you ca n't identify that you 're pregnant by that stage you should probably do society a favour and abort yourself . 
  i 've had liberal american jews arguing with me here on reddit that it is largely a native european problem , this new wave of antisemitism , that is causing jews to uproot their families from europe . 
  they really do n't have a clue . 
  cementing the out vote for our eu referendum is merkel . 
  i mean this sincerely : good luck mainland europe . 
  her ethnicity is relevant you imbecile , it 's for that reason she thinks she ca n't be racist - she said as much herself . 
   your logic is that this is related to eu and without eu this problem would be solved . 
  no , it is n't . 
  my perspective is that of a brit , who 's observing this crisis and considering voting to leave the eu in our referendum later this year . 
  it wo n't solve the problems other mainland european countries are having due to the decisions made by germany , geographically they 're at a disadvantage , but we 'll be able to fully take control of our own borders and regain our sovereignty with an exit . 
  i do n't think germany acts alone in this crisis , sweden has been culpable too , my point was simply that it was angela merkel who threw lighter fluid on a naked flame , and she , and by extension , germany hold the greatest culpability in this crisis becoming what it has . 
  hell , i 'd argue that if we do leave the eu , and it causes a break up in the union , then that 'd largely be on germany too . 
  you have n't applied any logic . 
   germans decision have nothing to so with eu yes they do . 
  they 're the figurehead of the union , and their decisions have repercussions for other eu countries . 
  not least because germany is now trying to impose migrant quotas on other eu countries . 
  not sure why you 're so intent on dismissing this . 
  what are you struggling to grasp here ? 
  the migrants would n't be making the journey in the first place if germany had n't made the decisions it had . 
  every other eu member state is now bearing the repercussions of said decisions . 
  you 're ignoring the fact that millions of migrants are trying to reach the eu because of the angela merkel 's irresponsible immigration policy , and most of them are passing through other eu countries to reach germany . 
  that is on germany . 
  this crisis is of their manufacturing . 
  you 're also ignoring the fact that germany sent out the invites , acting alone , and has since decided to impose migrant quotas on other eu nations , and sanction those who reject such quotas . 
  that is not independence . 
  that 's treating sovereign countries like eu satellite states . 
  you 're also completely overlooking the fact that once the migrants get eu papers in germany then they 're free to travel where ever they like in the eu . 
  the free movement of people principle is meant to apply to europeans , that is the founding concept of the principle . 
  it 's an ideal that does n't account for the current climate where it can be exploited by large numbers of economic migrants straight from 3rd world countries , often from cultures which are completely alien to ours as western europeans . 
  this is a social issue as well as an economic one .
