  iirc synaulia does something similar for roman music but its more the closest recreation possible to the period music . 
  they actually used it for the background music in a party scene in gladiator .

  it is absolutely binding . 
  it has the weight and force of international law . 
  a sufficient number of states recognize the udhr as it defines what rights and freedoms the un charter seeks to protect - and the charter * is * binding . 
  the declaration itself is customary law now - and norway has no excuse , they voted in favor - they recognize it . 
  the main opposition to the declaration were saudis and communists . 
  i 'm sorry to interject but its `` lose '' ( to be deprived of ) - `` loose '' is to not be fixed tightly,

  fuck me one flippant comment about the guardian and i have an `` anti-guardian bias '' its not like im doubting anything they say or think they are unique , i just do n't read swedish news also  the guardian was the * first * place i found it, 
  did n't need to know his name should i be surprised the guardian was the first place i found it, 
  i guess they are n't mutually exclusive, 
  its one thing for the un to be unable to carry out effective measures to encourage human rights without treading on international law or making the situation worse . 
  its another thing to elect the saudi envoy to chair a panel on the human rights committee . 
  its like making extremely belligerent nations permanently in charge of global security and the only binding resolution from the un with full veto powers . 
  i know an alternative . 
  carry a shield !, 
  not scary , good defensive use , make it heavy enough for arm related gainz and when things go to shit you can beat the hell out of a mother fucker and defend yourself at the same time .

  it was legitimized by a unsc resolution to which no veto powers were exercised and strictly pertained to the defense of the civilians of benghazi . 
  mission creep did the rest but the legality of the action was not disputed .

  the referendum was an advisory poll , not legally binding as an election the institutions of the eu are composed of * directly elected representatives * , representatives of the executive office of the constituent members states , the heads of state or government from the constituent member states , and commission nominees from national governments . 
  if you do n't like the way the eu government is run , you can either vote on it directly or vote for a different government in your own country . 
  to that end , the people in a parliamentary democracy do n't get to choose cabinet positions , or peerages , or supreme court judges , or permanent undersecretaries , or departmental heads . 
  why is there no imminent revolution against this ghastly anti-democratic structure called the government of the united kingdom ? 
  nobody is accusing the french of being too humble,

   when did russia in your opinion occupy and oppress half of europe for 40 year ? 
  hopefully you do n't mean the cold war . 
  i did mean that ? 
  when they violently suppressed political opposition to the soviet sphere of influence .

  and why should russia 's neighbors give a shit about what putin did for russia ? 
  they are n't russian , they are n't russia , they do n't stand to gain from it . 
  occupying and oppressing half of europe for 40 years was decidedly their fault . 
  maybe if they were n't such massive cunts - or knew how to run a government , an economy , a legal system , or act towards their european peers with any sense of decency , their former puppet states would n't have such a passionate hatred for them . 
  its not nato 's fault that , while russia 's neighbors are no doubt aware of the history of american imperialism , they still very much prefer american troops in their borders than russian ones . 
  it 's not undermining their sovereignty to hold them to standards expected by the treaties and conventions to which they are a part of . 
  how russia does things typically comes at the expense of other european nations as well as itself somehow , so cooperation is a non starter while the kremlin is stuck with their current geo political outlook . 
  they are intransigent and dangerous to everyone 's expense , even their own .
