those comments were a shit storm . 
  christ . 
  one that got me `` it does n't take into account the cost of illegal immigrantion '' . 
  um . . what has that got to do with eu migration ? 
  i mean , we probably get that with or without being in the eu . 
  i would , yeah . 
  if i said `` english is great at football '' , i would probably be talking about the country 's footballing skills in general , rather than the national team . 
  yeah , but saying `` chelsea is great '' and `` stoke is shit '' to me would mean you meant the places . 
  it 's ok . france did worse this year . 
  although their song was awesome !, 
  i 'm french-irish , but i was born and raised in england so i usually just say i 'm a french-irish brit . 
  i speak french but my parents never really impressed upon me a sense of national identity so i do n't really feel a particular affinity to any country except during rugby , where i support all three in order of ireland  france  england . 
  i live in the netherlands now and i speak some dutch , but most people just assume i am english because of my accent and i am culturally english , due to having been brought up there ! . 
  my so is hungarian , but we met in germany . 
  so if we have kids they are going to be incredibly confused with nationality !, 
  just to throw an extra nationality into the mix : although my parents are french and irish , my french mother passed away when i was young and my step-mum is canadian . 
  hopefully it wo n't take tennet as long to build nord.link as it took them to to build norned !, 
  think you may have replied to the wrong post there !, 
   gaelic the irish call it irish . 
  but that is gaelic . 
  or gaeilge in ... irish !, 
  by calling it irish you are calling it what every person calls it . 
  irish , an official language of the republic of ireland . 
  equal status to english . 
  what 's the official language of the uk ? 
  there is n't one . 
  english is de facto . 
  so it is n't ridiculous . 
  if welsh and catalan became official languages of an eu state they would have the right to official eu language . 
  so long / u/nilbop . 
  he died of snu-snu . 
  yeah , but germany has becks . 
  bloody vikings coming over here , stealing our women and taking back to vikingland . 
  did n't malta try to become an integral part of the uk once ? 
  happy independence day though !, 
  netflix entered the dutch market last october and i remember seeing several ads for it on tv . 
  so , that would be why the dutch have heard about netflix !, 
  very true . 
  i do this ( i 'm in nl ) . 
  that said though , it 's getting better and also it makes it easier to watch some dutch shows with subtitles on demand to help me improve my dutch !, 
  two five year terms apparently . 
  the uk has no limits . 
  er ... did i say that ? 
  i meant that militarily greece has a far superior force than fyrom . 
  i am well aware there are many difficulties in the relationship between the two nations . 
  as a brit irishman to say such nuances are stupid would be stupid as britain and ireland also have many difficulties . 
  compared to fyrom greece is a superpower, 
  you answered the question i was thinking . 
  wondered if latin played a part since it 's similar in french . 
  thanks !, 
  english expression : do n't look a gift horse in the mouth . 
  i love how expressions can be similar in languages !, 
  edit : i a word . 
  thanks / u/goodguy1066, 
  i always enjoy the fact that the first country to declare war * on * germany was new zealand just due to the time difference . 
  took canada a week later to declare war . 
  but the government was on holiday . 
  however , their vote was never in doubt . 
  saba is actually the netherlands proper though . 
  greenland is not denmark proper so the two do n't compare . 
  technically , * technically * , the highest moutain in the netherlands is [ mount scenery at 887m ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_scenery ) . 
  but only since 2010 when the netherlands antilles was dissolved and saba became part of the netherlands proper . 
  also , honorable mention to [ scafell pike ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/scafell_pike.jpg ) , the highest mountain in england ( 977m ) [ snowdon , the highest mountain in wales ( 1085m ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/view_towards_y_lliwedd_from_the_summit_of_yr_wyddfa-snowdon_-_geograph.org.uk_-_702192.jpg ) and , [ slieve donard , the highest mountain in northern ireland ( 850m ) . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slieve_donard ) it does n't count towards the uk as it is in an overseas territory but the highest mountain in any of the british controlled land is [ mount paget \\ ( 2935m \\ ) in the south georgia islands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_paget ), 
  i 've done scafell pike , but never ben nevis . 
  [ it 's just called windermere . 
  not lake windermere . 
  you are calling it lake winderlake otherwise . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2d8ou3/7_wonders_of_your_country/cjnzbjg ), 
   ~ ~ lake ~ ~ windermere it 's just windermere . 
  the suffix - mere tells you that it is a body of water . 
  how many lakes are there in the lake district ? 
  one !, 
  bassenthwaite lake . 
  all the rest are meres , waters and tarns . 
  what is the difference ? 
  well , a tarn and a water both from old norse . 
  tarn coming from the word for pond ( * tj\u00f6rn * ) and is a mountain lake . 
  a water also comes from old norse and means ... lake !, 
  so it 's just a etymological difference . 
  a mere , however , * is * different to a water/lake ( although it still means lake ) . 
  a mere is broad in relation to the depth . 
  of course , there all ultimately mean lake , but only one of the them carries the name . 
  fyi , i am from cumbria , so i get pedantic about this . 
  im on mobile so i ca n't link but uk 1 . 
  the lake district stunning area of beauty . 
  lakes and mountains ( although technically only one lake ) . 
  the uk has many beautiful places but this one stands out for me . 
  york walled city and still gorgeous . 
  i was torn between this one and chester but went northern as a northerner . 
  both great examples of the walled cities of old . 
  the channel tunnel ( shared with france ) a railway tunnel under the sea connecting the uk to the mainland for the first time in centuries . 
  built by the ancients it is a place of pagan worship . 
  caernefon castle possibly the best preserved castle in the uk . 
  even if it is n't it 's a fantastic display of the castles of old . 
  forth bridge . 
  for a country surrounded by the sea of course something over it ( as well as under it ) will make it on . 
  an impressive feat of engineering and `` painting the forth bridge '' means a never ending task because once you finished you had to start again !, 
  a new type of paint in recent years , however , means they finished painting in 2011 . 
  giant 's causeway ok , i was only going to post one landscape but i had to mention this one .
