  - apoel nicosia , the surprise team of the 2011-2012 uefa champions league, 
  wiki told me that was the other name for it and now it makes sense !, 
  i 've been told tatanka is what it is called in krakow where it is considered ` their ' drink . 
  however , this information comes from my english friend who came back from a piss-up weekend there so i am inclined to take it with a pinch of salt . 
  can you ( or anyone ) confirm/deny this ? 
  edit : ha!i said salt when talking about krakow . 
  man , those salt mines were incredible . 
  bison grass vodka and apple juice . 
  or as wetherspoons in the uk calls it ; a cheeky bison . 
  its like drinking cinnamon apple pie . 
  i would recommend getting a cheap flight to somewhere in the uk near birmingham . 
  [ skyscanner ] ( www.skyscanner.net ) is a good website for searching through flights . 
  then go to [ transpenine express ] ( http://www.tpexpress.co.uk/ ) website and book a train ticket ** in advance ** . 
  you will save a load booking in advance . 
  you can fly to manchester for # 64 from hamburg international . 
  there is a train station at man airport so its pretty easy ( follow the signs for station ) word of warning about advance train tickets - you will book a specific time . 
  if you are not on that train , your ticket is deemed void and you will get fined and have to pay the full price ticket . 
  just give yourself enough time to get the train ( i usually give myself an hour to get from the plane to the train ), 
  also , / u/futski mentioned that when they said francfied vikings , 
  as half norman i laugh in your general direction . 
  * bof *, 
  born and bred in britain , so culturally i am british . 
  i 've lived in ireland and i 've lived in france and i realise that my cultural up bringing was different even if my heritage is those two countries . 
  usually i say i am a franco-irish brit , and if people ask me who i support i say `` it depends who is playing '' . 
  strange that austria does n't partake in the working holiday scheme . 
  so could not just decide to get a british passport ? 
  i thought you could if you wanted to . 
  that thing about paying : i went to turkey on my french passport ( by train ) . 
  i did n't have to pay to enter . 
  my mates on british passports had to pay 25 $ . 
  was odd . 
  has anyone else here ever switched ? 
  i have n't switched exactly , but i never took up my right to british nationality . 
  stuck to dual nationality of irish-french . 
  because they want to brand themselves as an international university . 
  they also promote themselves to germany and other eu countries . 
  they wanted to get into ucas to make applying easier , but this has been rejected . 
  there are fees in the uk and there are fees in nl , but the dutch fees are nominal ( c. 1700 $ p/a ) . 
  it 's a young university so they want more students , by advertising themselves as a cheaper british alternative , they will get more students . 
  i am honoured !, 
  and yup , fasos graduate reporting in . 
  ah hardly matters now . 
  graduated couple years back . 
  i was so uninformed when applying through ucas by my school . 
  when i have kids going to uni ( in what ... 30 years ? 
  ) , you can bet that i will have done plenty of research for uni at home and abroad for the right choice !, 
  so if i had applied with my french passport , i could have gone to scotland for free ? 
  man , i was this close to going to aberdeen too . 
  let the record show that i am holding my index finger incredibly close to my thumb without them touching so as to indicate a very small margin . 
  felt bad for the dutch veteran on the news last night standing outside the [ american cemetery in the netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands_american_cemetery ) . 
  he was visibly upset : `` i ca n't go see my friends . '', 
  but yes , he is not your average european . 
  i am aware , and you are correct . 
  also , the dutch were only there seasonally . 
  they would arrive in the spring and leave when the weather turned , returning the following year to re-establish the trading posts . 
  made it much harder to try and defend against the permanent ~ ~ english ~ ~ british settlements . 
  i would like to point out that since this video was uploaded , great britain is now able to import energy from the netherlands too via a 1000mw subsea cable that came online in 2011 . 
  there are also plans for more cables to norway and iceland to help gb cope with future energy demands . 
  there is also a plan for a `` wind farm '' bridge across the irish sea that would effectively link the irish single energy market and the gb national grid to help the two zones meet demand . 
  yeah , he was polish . 
  he then said how britain would have fallen in wwii if it was n't for the polish saving its arse . 
  whilst that last part has merit , i was just so dumbfounded that i was silent . 
  could n't believe his hostility considering all i had done was miss what someone said !, 
  i suppose you just get tools like that in every country . 
  did so much lose it as agree a trade for surinam as the dutch position in north america was untenable and they recognised a lost cause !, 
  hmm , yeah i guess that counts a losing it . 
  i had someone get properly pissed off at me when he overheard my conversation with two of my friends `` where is that person in our class from ? '', 
  `` poland . '', 
  `` oh , right . 
  i misheard her then . 
  i thought she said holland ! '', 
  * guy interrupts * `` you better watch yourself . 
  poland is a bit f *** ing different to holland . '', 
  tool . 
  had to double take when you said `` worst '' selection . 
  i was thinking `` why would they have a selection of the most terrible beers ? '', 
  then i realised you meant sausage ... 
  i am going to nijmegen tomorrow to drink with a mate . 
  there is a good bar there called caf\u00e9 de mug that has really nice special beers . 
  i see from google maps that cafe samson is a ~ ~ 2 minute walk ~ ~ a short stagger from de mug !, 
  going to have to check it out . 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  what 's the place in nijmegen ? 
  well , its older english , but not as old as old english , and more developed that middle english . 
  i suppose its late middle english as his work would have greatly contributed to what we know today as modern english . 
  i have not !, 
  thank you for bringing it to my attention . 
  i have been to [ de zotte ] ( http://www.dezotte.nl/#home ) which has an excellent selection of beer and i plan to go to de molen next time i 'm there . 
  there is a bar in the city i live in the east that has a fantastic selection too . 
  i 'm not in amsterdam that often unfortunately . 
  that 's the hungarian translation, 
  holland does have amazing beer . 
  but sometimes i want a nice 3,5 % english ale . 
  holy crap you 're right . 
  i always though places like lesotho were insignificantly small but its about the same size as nl !, 
  not very insignificant !, 
  not dutch , but i live there so i wish holland had more ales and fab ice lollies . 
  otherwise it 's pretty much set . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  i do n't speak hungarian either tbh .
