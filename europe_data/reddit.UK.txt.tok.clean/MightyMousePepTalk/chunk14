  there is probably an accent there somewhere too . 
  hell , even in hungarian its * a bomba *, 
  that 's where i drank it !, 
  could have been actually . 
  windjammer maybe ( i recall there being a ship on the label , or at least something nautical themed ) . 
  may have been dungaravan , but as the windjammer comes in a cask , i am going to say , but i 'm not 100 % . 
  this particular one was n't . 
  i do n't recall the brewery , but it was a cask ale with a hand pump and everything ( after three years in ireland , i was shocked to see one . 
  shut up and take my money moment ) . 
  i have had o'hara though , and they were certainly very nice . 
  never had it , but [ fra diavolo ] ( http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/ulverston-fra-diavolo/143921/ ) is my personal favourite . 
  i am also biased at it 's my local !, 
  i polish these off far too quickly . 
  you have a really nice beers made by the bevog brewery . 
  technically , its austrian since that is where the brewery is , but it was set up by a slovene . 
  he founded it in austrian because ( i am led to believe ) there was less bureaucracy than in slovenia . 
  anyway , they do really nice beers . 
  the ipa is particularly awesome . 
  i got lovely and drunk on la\u0161ko whilst watching rugby last time i was in ljubljana . 
  haha , yeah i know it is n't the best beer , but sometimes you just ca n't find anything else !, 
  you get an upvote for galway hooker . 
  lovely stuff . 
  i have tried a couple of irish ales that are style more along the english types . 
  they were from wexford , i think , and they were really nice . 
  only found them in one bar in galway though . 
  some of my favourite german beers are rothaus , schlenkerla ( bacon beer ! ), 
  and , for a beer you can find almost anywhere , bitburger . 
  i drank karmeliet one night . 
  almost got killed by a metro train . 
  edit : stuff is amazing, 
  this article only mentions british civil servants have not successfully applied , so those through the european fast stream programme . 
  i would be curious to know how many got through the ad5/7 epso tests in 2012 , ie , not through the uk civil service . 
  i applied in 2012 , but i was unsuccessful ( damn you numerical reasoning ) . 
  there was no epso for ad5 in 2013 . 
  hopefully next year i will have more luck ( i 'll study harder . ), 
  i do n't doubt the article as i have heard many times from many people that the number of brits in the eu is dropping for a number of factors . 
  one of these , not mentioned in the article , is that those who joined in 1973 are now retiring and those brits are not being replaced by more brits . 
  - the fjords where created by [ slartibarfast ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slartibartfast ) - you got some [ nazi zombies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dead_snow ) running around - svalbard is full of [ panserbjorn ] ( \\ ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/characters_of_his_dark_materials#iorek_byrnison\\ ) - you have some [ damn fine skiiers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage ), 
   russia fought with them in wwii , but norwegians held out for a couple years ( not entirely sure )  their language bros with the hungarians i think you are confused with finland . 
  aaaand changed !, 
  ~ ~ sparta !, 
  ! ~ ~ this . 
  sparta !!!, 
  the trouble was that you said they were a ` problem ' and problems come with a [ final ] ` solution ' . 
  i have heard people say similar things to you . 
  had a debate on it once with central and eastern europeans ( they debated , i listened ) . 
  a german eventually piped up saying `` what you guys are saying concerns me . 
  that is what we said in germany about the jews . '', 
  what they were saying was similar to what you said . 
  now , i do n't come from an area where there are roma so i am in no position to comment on them , but it is easy to make the comparison between your comment and nazi germany . 
  i just feel the quality of life is greater in the netherlands . 
  the thing that strikes me the most is how much healthier people look , especially in the cities and when you go into a supermarket there is n't an entire aisle dedicated to crisps . 
  maybe i would go back to retire , but i 'm young and the world is large and so many more cool places to see and to live in . 
  i did the uk for 18 years . 
  * `` why do you go away ? 
  so that you can come back . 
  so that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors . 
  and the people there see you differently , too . 
  coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving . '' * - terry pratchett , * a hat full of sky *, 
  i went the other way from uk to nl ( via ireland ) . 
  nhs is free , but national insurance costs more than the health care premium . 
  but if you 're a student i guess that does n't matter much !, 
  anyway , i agree with you and it 's quite similar the other way . 
  only thing i would say is i would n't move back to the uk . 
  not on your nelly . 
  - lordi ( my mate met his finnish girlfriend at a eurovision party too ! ) . 
  i personally think [ waldo 's people ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybbnqnspsea ) did not deserve to come last . 
  unfortunately , their [ live song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gs8sog7-zy ) was not well delivered . 
  - lakes lakes and lakes - international women 's day is the only day of the year finnish men do n't beat their wives ( a finn told me this once . 
  it was tongue in cheek ) - there is a wife carrying competition - winter war and that very good sniper man - finn 's go to estonia for booze - planned tunnel to estonia - jari litmannen - those baby boxes - finland is basically a social utopia for the welfare system and the more or less unrivalled education system - santa claus and reindeer driving license - finnish has lots of umlauts and has a couple of words similar to hungarian words . 
  - tampere is the manchester of finland all i got . 
  got one !, 
  [ but ... wait ... no ... ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/firefly.gif ), 
  `` there is no such thing as bad weather , only inappropriate clothing . '', 
  got to make sure you waterproof up !, 
  what / u/l14qu and / u/presuminged said . 
  great infrastructure and it 's flat . 
  virtuous circle really . 
  people cycle because of the infrastructure , which means its easier for more people to cycle so you need more infrastructure . 
  you end up with pretty impressive things like the [ hovenring ] ( http://pricetags.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hovenring2.jpg ) in eindhoven . 
  imo , infrastructure in the netherlands is just fantastic . 
  roads , public transport . 
  top stuff . 
  interesting article but i had a couple of issues with it . 
  my main issue was  `` should a club now turn away a russian oligarch or arab sheikh who may generously offer to buy a star-studded squad for them or a brand new stadium ? '', 
  ffp allows for clubs to spend as much as they want on infrastructure , training facilities and youth development . 
  it 's mainly wages and transfer fees that the ffp seeks the curb the spending on by balancing it against gate receipts and other income ( sponsorship etc ) in theory , a club could get a wealthy benefactor who could build a massive stadium ( manchester city are currently in the process of expanding the etihad ) to increase revenue to spend on players . 
  would this reinforce the status quo ? 
  probably , because the big clubs could afford to expand their stadium * and still fill them * . 
  i pulled this from the ec 's page on enterprise and industry  in 2012 cigarettes accounted for a large number of interceptions ( 31 % ) . 
  miscellaneous goods ( e.g. 
  bottles , lamps , glue , batteries , washing powder ) were the next largest category ( 12 % ) , followed by packaging materials ( 10 % ) . 
  postal and courier packages accounted for around 70 % of customs interventions in 2012 , with 23 % of the detentions in postal traffic concerning medicines . 
  so i would say there could be a high chance it will be seized . 
  they would probably x-ray the package and , upon seeing it is a handbag from thailand , could use it as valid grounds to examine it . 
  i do not know for certain but they would probably know what was fake , no matter how good a copy it appears to be . 
  was camping in austria once , in seefeld . 
  car broke down on thursday . 
  towed to a garage . 
  could n't get part till monday .
