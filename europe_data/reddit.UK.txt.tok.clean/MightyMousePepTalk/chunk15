  call insurance company . 
  they put us up in a hotel in innsbruck until the car is fixed . 
  one of the best holidays i 've ever had . 
  austria : - great food ( schitznel ! ), 
  - great drinks ( coffee !, 
  almdudler ( is that austrian ? ) ), 
  - tonnes of history , pretty well preserved - fantastically stunningly beautiful countryside - beautiful women edit : forgot the ' ? ', 
  i 've noticed this . 
  the pricing seems to be way higher in nl than in uk . 
  it 's why i kid myself into believing i should keep my old school nokia ... 
   unlike all of its other territories [ britain has plenty of territories that it has not offered independence to ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_overseas_territories ) so your claim is incorrect . 
  but , but , it 's from maastricht !, 
  i 'm chuffed to see my alma mater in the news !, 
  in what way does it make it a hard precedent ? 
  it is very hard to agree to anything concerning gibraltar with the uk , but i 'm curious as to what you meant by hard precedent . 
  iirc the spanish claim is not about the actual rock of gibraltar , it is about the isthmus of gibraltar . 
  the treaty of utrecht agreed to ceed the fort to the uk , with the distance of a canon shot from the fort to the spanish border to be neutral ground . 
  i believe the issue the spanish have is that the british have built on this land so in affect claiming land that both sides had agreed would belong to no one . 
  this does n't deal with the issue of punitive border checks , but i felt it necessary for some clarification . 
  yeah i knew that hungary was a kingdom without a king until 1946 from a tv show where you had to answer questions and avoid the bombs . 
  think that 's what it was called . 
  you won money but the bomb meant you lost . 
  i had grabbed a water bottle from the fridge and went to ferihegy airport . 
  got to security realised it was still full so i thought `` i 'll just neck this quickly '' . 
  took a massive swig out of it . 
  thankfully i was next to a bin otherwise airport security would have been covered in the stuff . 
  it was n't that is was n't nice . 
  it was just * very * unexpected !, 
  - really good mates with the poles - home of great , hearty food . 
  love goulash , love halaszle . 
  just wow . 
  oh , and turo rudi . 
  om nom nom . 
  - you have mental horseriders in the great plains that do insane things like [ this ] ( http://online.wsj.com/media/0518pod01.jpg ) . 
  - unicum is a fierce drink , but great for indigestion . 
  palinka can be nice ( so long as you dont mistake it for water like i did once ) - founded in 1000 by sint istvan . 
  - the turul bird ( you can see a statue of one at tatabanya ) is a national symbol of the country and one impregnated emese . 
  the baby was a boy and was prince almos . 
  - was a kingdom until the battle of mohacs when they were defeated by the turks and was carved up . 
  you can still see evidence of the ottomans in cities such as eger which has the most northern ottoman minaret in europe . 
  eger was also the sight of a famous battle and has a very full-bodied wine called bull 's blood . 
  - balaton is the largest freshwater lake in europe outside of scandinvia - picked the wrong side in both world wars . 
  some hungarians are still a bit peeved about trianon . 
  after trianon on sopron had a vote to decide its fate and it voted the remain hungarian . 
  - water polo is pretty much your national sport . 
  also kick arse at canoeing in the olympics - many famous hungarian footballers . 
  the most famous arguably ferenc puskas . 
  i could go on . 
  beautiful country . 
  great people . 
  then again , my so of over 6 years is hungarian and i 'm going in a week on holiday !, 
  going to p\u00e9cs and kek\u00e9s and other places !, 
  do i speak hungarian ? 
  i 've tried . 
  lord knows i 've tried !, 
  * edit : included my little knowledge of hungarian . 
  edit ii : i have to mention * that * game . 
  england 3 hungary 6 . 
  1953 first time england ever lost at wembley . 
  the magical magyars : probably the greatest team to never win the world cup ( twice ), 
  you are a utopia . 
  i agree with nelson because he was an outstanding military commandor . 
  i suggest henry v for the same reason . 
  and they beat the french . 
  this an important plus . 
  ^ ^ ^ despite ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ flair , ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ french , ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ok ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ say . 
  agreed . 
  i would add henry v because of agincourt . 
  i would love to add edward ii for the most gruesome death of any british monarch , but perhaps not ... 
  i think [ queen boudica ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boudica ) is a good one for britain . 
  do n't forget the trusty : `` we want your tea . 
  give us tea and we 'll give you opium '' `` no . '', 
  well you see that gunboat at the entrance to the yellow river ? '', 
  `` yeah . 
  what about it ? '', 
  `` oh , nothing nothing . 
  but it would be a * shame * if it were to sail up the river would n't it ? '', 
  fine . '', 
  i love this !, 
  great idea !, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ also ^ ^ love ^ ^ the ^ ^ colourful ^ ^ penises . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ sorry !, 
  i think its marxist because he was the first to put it down in such a way , and of course he was against it . 
  lenin built upon it as have others . 
  a lot of ir theories can just be a way to explain what is happening so it all just is straight forward economics . 
  i guess its also marxist ( thinking off my head now ) because its a criticism of the west keeping others down for their own gains . 
  the world systems theory is closely associated with immannuel wallerstein and comes under the marxist school of thought , which influences the neo-marxist . 
  put simply it talks about there being three worlds : the core , the periphery and the semi periphery . 
  if you want to put it in a modern context : the eu ( core ) imposes strict tariffs on import of agricultural goods , which prohibits growth in the periphery and the semi periphery , which often have non-democratic and authoritarian government respectively . 
  as these lack the industry they export their raw materials to the core which exports manufactured goods , this sustains their high wages and social welfare . 
  the periphery and semi periphery have to buy these goods as they can not produce their own , but at such a cost that they have no money to invest . 
  rarely , a country can climb up the ladder and a good example is china , which is arguably a core country . 
  without the cap , the eu would import cheaper agriculture from abroad which could , in theory , allow periphery and semi periphery to increase their income and invest , thus allowing them to manufacture their own goods . 
  it 's a interesting theory , with some merit , but it 's quite old now ( 1979 ) [ here 's the wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world-systems_theory ), 
  no idea now to be honest . 
  there was no ad5 this year because they repeated an ad5 from a few years back after [ someone took the eu to court . 
  ] ( http://www.eutraining.eu/blog_comment/the_pachtitiscase_and_the_20102013_eu_exams_what_all_applicants_need_to_know ) moving to belgium , so long as you are in the french speaking area ( so , brussels would be fine ) will help a lot . 
  i did get accepted for the blue book trainneeship from october for social affairs ( as i applied as an irishman and they wanted to know about the irish employment situation ! ), 
  as i 've got a better paying job that 's good and exposes me to brussels a lot !, 
  if i applied now i would want something like dg energy .
