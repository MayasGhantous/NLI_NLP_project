  i sat one last year and sadly there was not one this year for ad5 . 
  there are 4 sections : numerical reasoning ( maths ) , verbal reasoning ( read a text ) , abstract reasoning ( what is the pattern ) and situation judgement ( prove your language skills . ), 
  ** numerical reasoning ** - i sucked at this because i did not practise . 
  get a book a learn . 
  `` how to pass numerical reasoning tests '' is a good one . 
  i used it for the uk civil service fast stream . 
  helped a lot . 
  ** verbal reasoning ** - if you did humanities you will , oddly , find this harder than a scientist ( for example ) as you start to assume too much . 
  do practise on this too . 
  for both the above , you get 4 answers to choose from on each question with answers that are all slightly similar , or common mistakes . 
  the hardest issue is time . 
  you get very little of it . 
  with numerical , the maths is no hard , but the time limit means you need to do very quick maths . 
  with verbal you need to pick the answer that is the exact answer , not `` well it sort of could be this . '', 
  ** abstract reasoning ** is a time constraint too , but you should practise this too . 
  you get 4 pictures and the symbols move around and you have to pick the next one in the sequence . 
  ca n't more than that really . 
  the above are done in the language you select as you mother tongue ( any of the 27 languages ) . 
  pick your mother tongue , using for second language * wo n't * give you any extra points . 
  ** situation judgement ** is your 2nd language ( english , french or german , i 'm guessing one of the latter two for you , unless you do the first three in irish ! ), 
  here , you get a statement and four answers . 
  you pick the best response , and the worst response . 
  eg '' your boss is sick and a co-worker as you to write his schedule . 
  do you : a - tell him to feck off b - offer to write a draft to confirm when he returns c - write one immediately d - decline to help b would be best , and a would be worst . 
  ** tl ; dr - yeah , it 's tough because of the time constraint . 
  how to pass numerical reason , how to pass verbal reasoning are good books . 
  practise your second language . 
  ** edit : formatting, 
  out of interest , are you familiar with the world systems theory in international relations ? 
  on a related note , did you hear about this ? 
  just saw it this minute http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23062284, 
  did not know that . 
  thanks for letting me know . 
  in what way did we reduce it ? 
  a link of some kind would be great if you do n't feel like writing it down . 
  or just a tl ; dr if that 's easier . 
  i do n't really know the details of cap , but my mate 's problem was not france . 
  to my mind people complain about france because historical france was such a defender of it , especially under de gaulle . 
  historical arguments are interesting , but not always relevant !, 
  iirc he blocked uk entry because of cap , as the uk wanted the likes of nz to be able to access the european markets . 
  when the uk did join , it had a negative impact on nz 's economy , much more so than australia 's and canada 's who had other resources and were not `` a british farm in the pacific '' - harold supermac macmillan . 
  however , my mate 's main problem was that it heavily favours crop growers , and where we come from , there is little , if any , arable land . 
  you ca n't grow crops in them there hills . 
  livestock is what we have ( so the price of milk is contentious ) . 
  anyway , it 's an interesting topic and i do n't know that much about it in terms of it 's current implementation . 
  that would probably be why the french are jealous of the british rebate , which makes sense . 
  a rough figure off the top of my head , but is n't the cap something like 50 % of the eu 's budget ? 
  he was more annoyed at the fact that because of the cap there are farmers in the uk ( maybe elsewhere , but this was his example ) that just fulfil their quota and get the cap then let the rest go to rot . 
  pisses him off no end . 
  i agree cap should be scrapped . 
  many reasons for this , but largely cos my farmer friend launched a full blown tirade at me once against it and ... well ... he was pursuasive ^ ^ and ^ ^ scary . 
  ^ ^ so ^ ^ very ^ ^ scary . 
  do we though ? 
  without the cap we do n't get a rebate . 
  at least the french are jealous of our rebate . 
  i did a course once about cultural identity ( wishy-washy , i know ) and one american said that `` it 's only americans that get europe 's cultural identity , europeans ca n't see it . '', 
  i , personally thought that was a load of shite and told him as much . 
  you 're point about people from iceland and greece being different is similar to what i used , but i 'm sure that people from alaska have different views to people from texas , even if they do speak the same language and have similar systems ( law , education , etc ) . 
  i said that sometimes i ca n't relate to people from southern england ( being northern ) , yet we 're from the same country . 
  or there are times when i can relate more to a german . 
  so , yeah , it does bother that people say that `` in europe they ... '' because europe so diverse and the countries change quite a lot , more so than state to state so you ca n't just lump it all together . 
  it 's like the yanks want us to be a united states of europe , which was something i used to think would be a good idea , but not anymore . 
  on a side note , the teacher made a statement that `` people from england probably have nothing in common with greeks '' . 
  she did not appreciate me blurting out `` prince philip is from greece ! '', 
  this was an annoying survey . 
  i 've lived in 3 countries in the eu since i left the uk , all for studying , but i now live in the last one . 
  was confusing as to how they wanted me to answer it !, 
  hey we gave you helgioland for zanzibar !, 
  you ca n't just go trading it away !, 
  haha , i like it . 
  ah hungary , the country that was a kingdom without a king until after world war two . 
  iirc ( the following info is based on a tour of edinburgh castle that i do n't really remember ) it has the oldest complete set of crown jewels in europe . 
  i read a guidebook to hungary recently and i came across a town that said `` the hungarian navy 's headquarters is based here . '', 
  not a lawyer , no . 
  but i deal a lot with the european commission and other eu institutions and i had studied ir with a large focus on the eu and how it works . 
  i got this job by being in the right place at the right time with the right background and chatting to a bloke in a pub . 
  i work on the regulatory side of an energy company . 
  something i find interesting about this is my home county of cumbria in england ( north-west , just below the red bit in scotland and west of the red bit on the east coast ) is 15-20 % . 
  there is n't a large population there , and most people are moving away to bigger cities such as manchester , london , or , like myself , abroad ( the netherlands in my case ) . 
  most people i know there are farmers , or left school at 16 . 
  my point is , how much does this account for youth migration ? 
  surely all over europe youth will move to bigger cities , even to different countries to get work . 
  from this , big cities are doing ok , in non-piigs countries . 
  that said , the unemployment does stil seem to be bad across a country . 
  she has n't been crowned . 
  he was the one that should be . 
  any tom , dick or harry can wear a tiara . 
  a dutch person can correct me on this , but afaik king and queens do not get crowned in the netherlands , so there is a no physical crown . 
  lake district . 
  perfection . 
  ( yes , i 'm from there . 
  yes , i am biased . 
  no , i have no proof . ), 
  i 'm going to hamburg soon for a weekend . 
  really looking forward to it !, 
  thing is , the british foreign service doesnt have that many british based staff . 
  a lot of them are locally sourced . 
  the higher ups ( ambassador , deputy ) would be uk based , but the general policy officers would be local staff who speak english . 
  cost saving .
