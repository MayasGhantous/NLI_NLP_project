  its just like nothing else . 
  other wordly . 
  truely a beautiful place . 
  we do n't have liechtenstein ... 
  yet . 
  how does this album not have a picture of the [ galway tram ? 
  ] ( http://www.oldgalwaypics.co.uk/siteimages/shopstreet_tram.jpg ) disgraceful . 
  and the [ arnhem tram ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rhlu3ikyzjg/sebaiczlcfi/aaaaaaaaa0s/2oqa7wslie4/s1600-h/1912+eb+oude+kraan.jpg ) too !, 
  europe : we 're awesome enough . 
  well arnhem is the only trollybus city in the netherlands !, 
  but hey !, 
  there is a fair bit to do here . 
  keeps me entertained !, 
  yeah , i 've also seen the connection break once , so it took everyone off and went back the garage on battery . 
  i understand ( from a tv show once ) warsaw was offered : a - the tower that you see in the photo ; or b - a metro . 
  you chose the metro . 
  you got the tower . 
  any truth to this ? 
  personally , it is the most interesting looking building on the list . 
  out of interest , i had a quick gander . 
  as i suspected , it is earth and rock http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knap_of_howar, 
  that 's not crystal , that 's glass . 
  `` oiy see yerv plaiyed glassy crystally befoar ! '', 
  in the dutch picture , there is a little tower on the left ( * het torentje * ) that is the dutch pm 's office !, 
  it also contains the hungarian crown jewels !, 
  although hungary has n't been a monarchy since 1949 . 
  we have these in arnhem nl !, 
  only trolley bus city in the country !, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.heula.fr/boutique/index.php?l=12&amp;id=313# ), 
  whoops . 
  you said royal standard . 
  my bad . 
  i am seeing the phrase `` loyalty to your county '' itt a lot . 
  i am french irish british and i live in the netherlands ( i hold citizenship of the first two , and i am eligible for the for third . 
  soon i would be eligible for the fourth , but not without giving up the others ) . 
  what sort of loyalty am i suppose to show ? 
  it is a nonsense term in this day and age . 
  edit : inb4 `` your flair is british '' . 
  indeed it is , i chose it because i was born there . 
  if i could choose three flairs , i would . 
  [ convivial ] ( https://www.google.nl/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=define%3a%20convivial ) is closest very old fashioned though and i think it does n't * quite * capture * gezellig *, 
  [ convivial ] ( https://www.google.nl/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=define%3a%20convivial ) is the closest word english has to it . 
  ah the old whom/who debate . 
  did you know you can use who wherever whom might be used ? 
  both are correct . 
  some will say that whom is more correct , but it is n't . 
  both as are correct . 
  if you look up whom ( and whilst , for that matter ) in the oed , you will see the term ` archaic ' after it . 
  it 's stylistic . 
  yes i do . 
  thank you !, 
  but the midgies man !, 
  you 're are ~ ~ narcissist ~ ~ masochist if you go to scotland in the summer !, 
  i was eaten alive once . 
  still got the scars 15 years later . 
  or be from the lake district !, 
  problem solved . 
  well ok . not really . 
  never mind . 
  haha . 
  the speaker of the house controls who gets to speak so there is an order . 
  the shouting is just if you agree or not . 
  from what i 've seen the women give just as good as the men . 
  slightly off-topic but i was walking past the houses of parliament in london once and a kid was looking over the fence with his mum . 
  he spotted a bike with a child seat on it and asked why that was there . 
  the mother responded , sounding slightly irritated : `` what ? 
  do you know think that women ca n't be mps ? '', 
  my thought : `` how do you know that bike belongs to a woman and not a man ? '', 
  i found it interesting that she was annoyed at her child for making a sexist assumption , when she made one herself !, 
  let 's use a random example : siemens . 
  shell will use a system from siemens and they will install it . 
  siemens well have their own safety measures of course but vein in an unfamiliar work place is a potential hazard . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  it is an issue . 
  the company i work for is taking steps to address this and shell probably are too . 
   if they have taken it seriously nothing would have happened . 
  that is a bit overly simplistic . 
  a company could have the best safety and accident prevention measures humanly imaginable and accidents would still happen . 
  to have a 0 % accident rate it just not realistic , but one can come close . 
  all it takes is one lapse , and it is often human error . 
  i do n't know how this accident happened , and nor do i work for shell , but they do take it seriously . 
  they have an ltif rating of 0.36 for 2013 compared to 1.1 in 2004 . 
  1.1 is a good score , 0.36 is great . 
  the fact that it has gone down shows that they are trying to improve it [ source ] ( http://www.shell.com/global/environment-society/performance/social-data/alternative-page.html ) note how they had five fatalities last year , all of whom were contractors . 
  contractors are not subject to the same training as shell employees ( and often are not in any industry ) . 
  i believe the above was a satirical piece, 
  wow . 
  shell is one company that takes safety * extremely * seriously . 
  i had a safety awareness course yesterday and shell were pretty much the bench mark for the oil and gas industry , and other related industries too !, 
  i think its telling that it says that a few workers received `` minor injuries '' . 
  that is good to hear ( obviously , not that people were injured , but that there were no major injuries or fatalities ) . 
  is that why you have so many stray dogs ? 
  it 's king 's day now !, 
  woah !, 
  let 's not go nuts !, 
  belgium fries are great . 
  no doubt . 
  but they are * different * to english chips and both have their merits . 
  that 's exactly how it would be pronounced . 
  probably spelt the way i wrote it .
