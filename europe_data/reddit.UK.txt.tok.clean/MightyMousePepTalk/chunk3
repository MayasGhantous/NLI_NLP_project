  but yeah pronounced the way you said . 
  after living in ireland there are 3 things i will never believe again : 1 . 
  your check is in the post . 
  we 'll have one more drink before we go . 
  `` of course i 'll still love you in the morning . '', 
   yet , south ireland has no culture nor language different to england . 
  christ , man . 
  are you trying to start a war ?!, 
  [ gaeilge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_language ) is one of the two official languages of ireland and it is * very * different to english . 
  irish culture , while similar in many aspects , is also quite different to english culture . 
  this is coming from a man who is half irish , raised in england and studied in ireland . 
  lastly , read the / u/libdependancyhell wrote . 
  it took 100 years of armed struggle for ireland to gain independence ( after the act of union ) and even then it was the whole island with problems still continuing to this day . 
  i would suggest doing a lot of reading about ireland before making such a comment again . 
  to start : [ 1798 rebellion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1798_irish_rebellion ) [ act of union 1800 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/act_of_union_1800 ) [ ireland 1801-1923 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_ireland_\\ ( 1801 % e2 % 80 % 931923 \\ ) ) [ young irelander rebellion 1848 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/young_irelander_rebellion_of_1848 ) [ land war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/land_war ) ( the word boycott come from this period ) [ gaelic revival ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conradh_na_gaeilge ) [ home rule movement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_home_rule_movement ), 
  so could we say czechia instead of czech republic ? 
  because sometimes the latter is a mouthful !, 
  it would be somewhat draconian [ to execute someone for stealing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/draco_\\ ( lawgiver \\ ) #draconian _ constitution ) . 
  i used netflix in argentina and everything was ov there . 
  there was the option of spanish language and spanish subtitles . 
  they also had lots of local shows to compliment the american/british content . 
  ah but that was in 2012 . 
  i ca n't really find figures for 2013 but i did find this that shows the [ uk 's res generation has increased by 6 % ] ( http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/10/uk-renewable-generation-reaches-record-high-for-a-bit/ ) so , it 's getting better at least and i 'm constantly hearing about the uk 's energy make-up ( i work in the energy field ) becoming more green . 
  do n't think you should have got so many downvotes without people saying why they were downvoting . 
  that was really helpful , but it has n't made it any easier for me to decide !, 
  since you 'll be in england anyway : lake district - gorgeous lakes and mountains . 
  many famous poets and peter rabbit chester - old walled city . 
  beautiful york - old walled city . 
  beautiful . 
  but since i live in the netherlands : amsterdam - an obvious choice . 
  it has great museums , looks nice . 
  good night life . 
  rotterdam - very modern architecture . 
  probably good night-life too . 
  utrecht - looks like a mini-amsterdam , but it has much less tourists !, 
  national park . 
  very pretty . 
  maastricht/valkenburg - beautiful semi-walled city in the south of the netherlands . 
  haha , love it !, 
  where on earth has that come from ? 
  are one of the largest producers of wind power in the world and had 15,000 mw of renewable energy sources installed in 2012 , and that will have just grown by now . 
  can more be done ? 
  of course it can . 
  in fact , national grid is investing # 10billion in the grid infrastructure to make it easier to connect res to the grid , as well as in interconnection . 
  i would hardly call it the texas . 
  edit : unless you take it in the sense below !, 
  no , you just need to register to vote with your local city council . 
  you should be able to find more information on their website . 
  once you have registered to vote , you should receive your voting card ( stempas ) before each election . 
  i saw something in / r/france that the average frenchman drink 18,4 l p/a of pure alcohol and i wondered what on earth that amounted to in actual drinks . 
  the hungarian empire ft austria, 
  is n't that the polish entry ? 
  i knew this . 
  brain fart . 
  thanks for correcting me . 
  having lived and studied in strasbourg , i think the strasbourgeois are in favour of it because of the money it brings in . 
  it certainly benefits the students who wish to work in the eu , as they can get more exposure to it . 
  heck , at the institute for political studies ( iep ) , part of the course is to spend a week debating in the parliament with the erasmus students . 
  that was cool . 
  there are also several lobby groups that lobby hard to keep the ep in strasbourg . 
  of course , there are other institutions in strasbourg , such as the court of human rights and the council of europe , so if the ep left , there would still be a presence . 
  although i do find it funny that churchill was in favour of the coe being in strasbourg because then it would be `` far enough out of the way to not cause any trouble '' ( paraphrased , probably ) question : i heard that the french kind of ambushed the eu by building a massive building and then when the eu was looking for a place for parliament they said `` well , we have a building . 
  you have to use it . 
  it 's built now . '', 
  any idea how true that is ? 
  on a total aside . 
  my mate used to work in an irish pub there ( the dubliners ) and one night nigel farage came in . 
  some belgians saw him , then cheered , and he bought them all drinks ( this was just after he made his comments on van rumpey ) . 
  the night ended with my mate and farage in a strip club . 
  edit : better nomenclature, 
  ha , sorry . 
  odd moment . 
  it was cause you praised romania so i was implying that was unpatriotic so the state might want to question you . 
  did n't work . 
  never been great at this whole joke malarky !, 
  in fairness , the beer can be fine and if its a cheap pint you 're after ( especially in london ) , then its great !, 
  but they do n't do music or sports , which one way they can have the beer cheap . 
  cheap burger and a pint ? 
  brilliant . 
  delicious beer and great food ? 
  not so good . 
  hopefully , someone from london can give you a more precise answer but a pub is a good place to go . 
  [ this list from the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-london-best-pubs ) is probably a good place to start . 
  you will find lots of hearty english fare . 
  another good place would be to find a good curry house . 
  wherever you stay in london just ask there for their recommendation for a nearby pub with good pub grub , or a good curry house nearby . 
  if you get directed to a wetherspoons , you will find cheap food and cheap beer , but not necessarily a good reflection of either !, 
   the best song on that contest was - god help me - romania interesting . 
  perhaps you could come and state the case for that in person at the following address : 1062 budapest , andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat 60 . 
  it does n't and i never claimed it did . 
  the list / u/locutusofborges posted misses out our wide range of stews such as lancashire hotpot . 
  i love a good * boeuf bourguignon * or * cassoulet * but english stews can be delicious too . 
  that 's the joke . 
  i am from the lake district , not too far from the [ wettest place in england ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seathwaite,_allerdale#climate ) the joke being that the days it is not raining , it is also snowing and therefore still wet . 
  the weather in the uk can be good , especially may and june . 
  but yes , in poland you get much nicer summers and much harsher winters . 
  edit : mixed up my seasons . 
  good good !, 
  there is a steak house in dublin that does good beer for the meat . 
  bear , i think it 's called .
