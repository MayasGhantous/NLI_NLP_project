  maybe next time i 'm in budapest i 'll visit again . 
  perhaps because at lot of it happened before there was a germany ? 
  and during the time of the austrian empire so there is not so much affiliation was the current austrian state ? 
  just pure speculation on my part . 
  well we 've badly damaged it after lots of wear and tear . 
  would cost you a fortune !, 
  as britain was punching germany , ireland flicked its ear and britain relatiatec with excessive force . 
  but ireland kept flicking . 
  once everything was done britain was truely fed up and told ireland to bugger off but decided to keep his hat . 
  i would say , as a rule of thumb , if you go to any medium sized city , you can ` break-in , but go smaller , especially rural , you will have a much harder time as people are much more insular . 
  i think that is true wherever you go . 
  i live in a medium sized dutch city and had no real difficulty making at least a few friends . 
  i used to live in maastricht though , and limburgers are known for being much more reserved at first . 
  so there are plenty of exceptions !, 
  no offense , but no . 
  a lot of people would arrive fresh in any city having come from smaller surrounding towns . 
  maybe a small city like carlisle , but manchester , birmingham , nottingham ? 
  you would be fine . 
  i was being incredibly generalist and going off what i have heard . 
  i onyl ever go to london on business , personally . 
  but in fairness , what i said could be said of almost any city . 
  because you are an island in an ocean of people . 
  no one speaks to each other in london . 
  so whilst you can be surrounded by people , you can also be completely alone . 
  yeah . 
  by postal or by proxy . 
  i voted in last ge by proxy . 
  having work in an a european embassy in another eu country , a joint eu embassy simple wo n't work . 
  sure , some share ( see the nordic states in germany ) , and uk and scotland might share if scotland votes to leave . 
  but one eu embassy where france/uk/germany all share ? 
  nope . 
  whilst similar policies , you are just not going to see eye to on everything . 
  and an embassy is a national governments representation in another state . 
  unless there is one federalised eu state , this simply can not work . 
  unless you mean one consulate , which is the part of an embassy that helps its nationals with passports etc. 
  but as stated , this is often done already . 
  i 'm not going to quote churchill . 
   ** the winds of change are blowing through this continent ** - prime minister harold macmilland 1960 . 
  the pm gave a speech in south africa and used these words . 
  it is considered to be a key speech in accelerating the decolonisation of africa . 
  it was especially poignant after britain 's humiliating and disastrous involvement in the suez . 
   ** rivers of blood ** - enoch powell mp , 1968 . 
  not a quote , but the name of a speech given by member of parliament enoch powell . 
  the name of the speech comes from the line `` as i look ahead , i am filled with foreboding ; like the roman , i seem to see ` the river tiber foaming with much blood . ' '', 
  it is a quote from virgil . 
  powell was discussing the affect that he believed immigration would have upon britain . 
  it is still discussed to this day . 
   ** the lady 's not for turning ** - margaret thatcher 1980 thatcher used these phrase when she refused to perform a u-turn on her liberalisation policies . 
   ** defeat ? 
  i do not know the meaning of the word ** - thatcher 1982 this was her response when she was told that britain entering into military conflict in the falklands could lead to defeat . 
  and now some light humour :  ** every prime minister needs a willie ** thatcher 1980s thatcher was referring to her deputy prime minister william whitelaw , on whom she depended greatly . 
  apparently the irony was lost on her . 
  [ pretty much anything by prince philip is hilarious ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-philip-quotes-relive-65-1445185 ), 
  well , it refers to the uk as england , so i would n't get too worked up . 
  at least officially germany has won it twice . 
   there are something like 80 counties in england . 
  depends how you look at it . 
  yes , if metropolitan and non-metropolitan . 
  but if you do ceremonial there are 48, 
  i do n't know anyone who says `` england never wins '' . 
  `` britain does n't even try anymore '' i have heard . 
  except for one entry in 2009 ( it 's my time ) , the uk has just entered crap and doesnt deserve to do well , especially since jemini . 
  edit : interestingly , the wiki page for 2014 says geri halliwell came 25th ... edit ii : that 's been removed now . 
  sochi was picked ages ago and then it was only a few months ago that things really kicked off about the homosexuality laws in russia , especially with stephen fry 's blog post comparing russia 's treatment of homosexuals to nazi germany 's treatment of jews . 
  why was it only a few months ago ? 
  surely , such protestation should have begun from when sochi was picked those years ago . 
  a few month before is too little too late . 
  i really do n't know how i feel about turkey joining . 
  on one hand i do n't see why we should stop them . 
  the romans controlled asia minor , the area has a long connection with europe . 
  why should islam be a reason to stop them ? 
  what if albania ever applied ? 
  would we stop them ? 
  but then , on the other hand , do we want the eu to have a border with iraq ? 
  he 'll , alex the great got to india !, 
  where doe we stop ? 
  turks are n't as european as those countries in the eu . 
  you would be pushing it to accept azebaijan and they are more european than turkey ( imo ) sure a country the size of turkey would command a lot of power , but would it be so bad to have an eastern power in europe for balance ? 
  there are a lot of muslims in europe . 
  would it be so bad to have a predominately muslim ( albeit secular ) country in the eu ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i really do n't know . 
  in the curve of the shield . 
  what if that cop is allergic ? 
  would that count as assault ? 
  longest standing alliance in existence , brah . 
  gon na be be some overspill !, 
  dunno which way . 
  white on blue for motorways ( but more reflective than german ones in my experience ) white on green for main roads black on white for minor roads white on brown for cultural sites . 
  you are quite right !, 
  i was just relaying what i saw on the episode of top gear . 
  it was only two or three people who were involved in creating the signage the uk knows today and it was just for the uk so each country is different . 
  even the airport one i mention is n't universal across all airports . 
   highway signs are white on green ( vert ) . 
  white on green is not used on [ motorway signage ( pdfwarning ) ] ( http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@motor/documents/digitalasset/dg_191928.pdf ) ( edit : in the uk ) although it is used on other roads . 
  very interesting though !, 
  i have some great useless knowledge here !, 
  i learnt it from top gear when james may interviewed the woman who played a very large part in creating britain 's motorway signs : before britain had its very easy to read signs , everything was done in capitals , because it was deemed that the bigger it is , the easier it is to read . 
  but have you ever tried to read something completely in capitals ? 
  it 's a pain .
