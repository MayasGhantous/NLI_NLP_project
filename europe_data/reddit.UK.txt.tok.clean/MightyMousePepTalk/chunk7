  lots of hipsters . 
  do n't worry about anything that occurs outside the m25 . 
  edit : added one for london, 
  they discovered elements , they just did n't name them after themselves . 
  why ? 
  it 's classic british modesty . 
  so ... what you 're trying to say is that it 's hungarian and the hu flag should be up there . 
  oh man , my so is going to be * thrilled * * ^ ^ ^ * ^ ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ realistically ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ wo n't ^ ^ ^ care . 
  we have hidden them in secret locations covering our overseas territories . 
  if you can find 'em , you can have 'em . 
  seriously , we ca n't remember where . 
  probably should have written a map ... 
  recently ? 
  * kontroll * - about ticket inspectors on the budapest metro . 
  a bit weird , but really good . 
  * made in hungaria * - about mikl\u00f3s feny\u00f6 returning to hungary in the mid-sixties with his parents , after spending a long period in time in the usa . 
  mikl\u00f3s feny\u00f6 is a famous hungarian rock and roll artist . 
  other hungarian films i have enjoyed : * moszkva t\u00e9r ( moscow square ) * - set in 1989 , a major year for hungary , a group of high school students do n't care and just want to have a good time * children of glory ( szabads\u00e1g , szerelem ) * - about the 1956 olympics and the men 's water polo final between hungary and the ussr . 
  turns into a literal blood bath . 
  the match in preceded by the 1956 hungary revolution and the subsequent quashing by soviet troops . 
  edit : just going to add in one of my alltime favourite movies : * cl\u00e9o de 5 a 7 * - french . 
  nouvelle vague . 
  awesome . 
  never has the term black humour been more apt . 
  amsterdam : you should do what you feel like , except walk in the fietspad, 
  could you care to elaborate on why greece would continually block fyrom entry ? 
  i understand there are issues with the name ( hence , fyrom ) , but why would n't greece want to accept some of the alternatives that have been suggested , such as northern macedonia ( just one example of a few i have read ) . 
  i have heard that the name is blocked because greece believes by allowing the name macedonia it would mean that fyrom would have terriotrial ambitions on the area known as macedonia that is integrally greece . 
  relatively speaking though , greece is a military superpower compared to fyrom . 
  my questions are these : why is greece so adverse to finding a solution to the name ? 
  what other issues do greece have with fyrom entry ? 
  why do bulgaria have issue ? 
  as a kid ( so 5-11 years old , before `` big boy school '' ) nothing . 
  i think my younger sibling learnt about the eu in school , so she would have learnt that capital cities . 
  that 's about it i think . 
  away from primary school and into secondary school ( 11-16 years old ) , we would have learnt about the dissolution of austro-hungary , the treaty of versailles and thus the creation of czechoslovakia . 
  this would then have been followed by the sudetenland and the eventual invasion of czechoslovakia ( i have a vague memory of watching a video on ww2 and seeing czechoslovak soldiers running with machine guns ) . 
  in sixth form ( 16-18 ) , my school had a trip to prague where a lot more was learnt . 
  jan palach ; king wenceslas ; the defenstration of prague ( possibly the oddest sounding way to start a major war ! ) . 
  do n't think my school does that anymore , and it would have been the exception rather than the norm . 
  * good king wenceslas looked out , * * on the fest of stephen . 
  * * and the snow laid all about * * deep and crisp and even . 
  in nl they developed their own system that does n't use visa or mastercard called pin ( although it works like a maestro abroad ) . 
  the fees on it are much lower than what visa would charge . 
  it has a slogan of * kleine bedrag , pinnen mag * , which roughly translates to `` small amount , you can pin '' . 
  it 's a really good system and it 's great at the supermarkets when they have a pin only cashier open . 
  some bars do n't accept pin , and its a pain , but virtually everywhere accepts it . 
  i thought as much , but i did n't want to make any rash generalisations . 
  this was a good read . 
  especially after the french circlejerk in / r/todayilearned over the weekend . 
  the caption half way down the page : `` britain suffers fatigue , germany dithers '' is , to me , pretty apt . 
  you will find very little desire in britain for any sort of military engagement . 
  i do n't know as much about germany , but they do appear to be reluctant to take military action . 
  france seems to be the most active on this front , but obvious it does not have the resources to go it alone the whole for long periods of time . 
  i have never heard this said , personally . 
  my first thought when i read the title though was `` what about languages that compound words ? '', 
  surely , the likes of german and hungarian etc are able to coin new as and when they need to by the use of compounds ? 
  `` president nixon , what about the law that says nobody can run for president more than twice ? '', 
  `` that 's right . 
  no body . 
  but this is n't my body . 
  nixon 's back , baby . 
  - * futurama * ( probably badly quoted ), 
  yeah , but much bigger landmass with a large non-eu/nato border . 
  do you use 1 and 2 cent coins ? 
  one of the first instances of a catholic country supporting a protestant . 
  got ta love the pragmatism of cardinal richelieu : pay a load of money to fund sweden 's war , so you do n't have to get involved yourself . 
  i did a ba in ireland and an ma in holland . 
  i 'll send a link over of what to expect from holland . 
  pm me if you want more info . 
  if i had to pick anyone for germany , it would be [ gustav stresemann ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustav_stresemann ) - won the nobel peace prize for reconciling with france ( alongside aristide briand , his french counterpart ) - ended hyperinflation in during the weimar republic by introducing the new currency the rentonmark . 
  - reduced the amount of reparations germany had to pay , and reorganised the reichsbank ( under the dawes plane ) . 
  of course , he was n't perfect . 
  but he did a lot of good in the * years of crises * during the early years of the weimar republic, 
  did you know the winner of france v italy in the 6n is now awarded the garibaldi trophy ? 
  i did n't until recently . 
  obviously , the netherlands has several rivalries including their football one with germany , the ajax/feyenoord one , and also nec nijmegen/vitesse . 
  however , there is also one between [ ijsselmeervogels and spakenburg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ijsselmeervogels#derby_ijsselmeervogels_-_spakenburg ) two amateur football teams . 
  it is considered one of the friendliest rivalries and it always receives national media coverage . 
  in 2011 , for example , 9,000 people attended . 
  good to see that not all rivalries have to be fierce !, 
  is n't in the treaty of amsterdam ? 
  you know what i learnt today ? 
  the highest mountain in nl is 877m high . 
  ok granted its in saba , but since 2010 it is officially a legit part of the netherlands , and not just kingdom of . 
  now i am certain the dutch antilles was just dissolved so the dutch could claim they have a high mountain !, 
  where is this ? 
  pretty much a custard , or a thick yoghurt . 
  imo anyway . 
  sticky toffee pudding . 
  ** cartmel ** sticky toffee pudding . 
  is that jesus in # 28 ? 
  you can apply to more than one !, 
  but you 'll have a great time either way !, 
  maastricht - ma european studies, 
  sorry , i see what you mean . 
  i thought your flair was friesland , not bayern !, 
  the article mentions the let me vote campaign , something i posted a month back . 
  here is the thread http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qjie8/let_me_vote_a_citizens_initiative_to_grant_the/, 
   i can have dual citizenship because both germany and romania are eu members but what does this have to do with the eu ?
