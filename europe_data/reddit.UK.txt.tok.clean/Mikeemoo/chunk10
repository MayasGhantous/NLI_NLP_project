  i 've noticed no differences at all . 
  however , we 've not left yet . 
  we 've not even enacted article 50 . 
  i 'll be surprised if i notice any real difference when we finally leave ... 
  i did n't notice the 2009 global crash , the double-dip recession . . etc. 
  like almost all uk `` newspapers '', 
  of course it can . 
  for events where you can only enter once per country , the eu has 28 chances of winning each medal because it 's using 28 different teams , compared to other countries having just one chance of winning each medal . 
  how many teams did china enter into the football ? 
  into the tennis doubles ? 
  into the rowing ? 
  into the cycling ? 
  into the gymnastics ? 
  how many teams did the eu enter into those events ? 
  such nonsense . 
  the eu has many , many , many more chances of winning a medal than the other countries because of the amount of athletes/teams that would be entered into the competitions . 
  the headline : uk consumers begin to feel post-brexit pinch the first line : the consequences of the shock vote have so far been mainly theoretical , but recent data suggest that the country 's tumbling currency is about to reach the high street bleh . 
  so they 're not , then ? 
  rash b !!!!!!!, 
  it 's holding up . 
  i feel really bad for him . 
  i guess you missed yesterdays thread asking the same thing . 
  out of which orifice did you pull that nonsense ? 
  are you / u/lolworth ? 
  no it 's not , 
  whaaat the fuck ? 
  why ? 
  do you have an asbo ? 
  fuck off to a different country then . 
  you sound like an angsty teenager . 
  uh , what ? 
  urhm , i 'm talking about the uk . 
  we do n't pay in euros . 
  braces are free for under 18s and cheap ( # 200-ish ? ),

  uk - * dental hygiene - complete myth . 
  we have some of the [ best teeth in the world ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32883893 ) . 
  we just do n't care about appearance as much as some other countries . 
  * that we care about the empire . 
  i see it discussed on reddit all the time , but it 's very misguided . 
  * the idea that we 're [ racist/intolerant/xenophobic ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/ ) . 
  i went to paris to propose to mrs mikeemoo . 
  i suffered a bit of [ paris syndrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ) . 
  that 's an olympic sport i could get behind . 
  16/24 golds in swimming . 
  only 8 in other disciplines . 
  if another country can end the usa domination of swimming , they 'd fall in line with the rest of us !, 
  a 6 year old , apparently . 
  i voted leave . . but this video is silly . 
  do not lt it dictat your fat, 
  news just in : people who love the eu and have eu related jobs approve of the eu . 
  they did n't vote for a party to do something against their will . 
  did the people of scotland write the thing you pasted above , or did the snp ? 
  you 've just pasted something saying that the snp think there should be a referendum ... we knew that already . 
  it was addressed in 2014 . 
  people did n't want it . 
  the polls show that people still do n't want it . 
  why not do yearly referendums , eh ? 
  lets make it part of new year celebrations or something . 
  irrelevant .

  ** edit : ** i love how you fucks just silently downvote . 
  does this break your little circlejerk , eh ? 
  the snp do n't feel that way . 
  the majority of the scottish * people * do n't want another referendum . 
  my surname :  this interesting old status name has its origins in the feudal system of medieval england . 
  it derives from the middle english `` frankelin '' , from the anglo-norman french `` franc '' meaning free , in the sense of liberal and generous , plus the germanic suffix `` ling '' . 
  the status of the franklin varied somewhat according to time and place in medieval england ; in general , he was a free man and a holder of fairly extensive areas of land , a gentleman ranked above the main body of minor freeholders , but below a knight or a member of the nobility . 
  the surname dates back to the late 12th century . 
  so my . . great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather owned quite a lot of land . 
   and if scotland deserves another referendum for independence it does n't . 
  the article starts on a bullshit premise . .  about 590,000 people who live there now -- citizens of other eu countries -- will no longer be eligible to stay politicians have said many times that it 's extremely unlikely that we 'll be `` kicking people out '' . 
  aye , and we smashed it . 
  athletics starts today , though - not sure how strong our team is this year . 
  i could pretend to know something about economics , but i 'll refrain because i have n't a clue . 
  probably something to do with pizza , pasta and mario . 
  i would n't be so cocky , lad - germany , italy and france are close behind us . . 
  global market crash ... 
  weird selection of cities in those lists . 
  some of the bigger uk cities are n't listed , but some of the smaller ones are . 
  who needs oil anyway , eh ? 
  i know the stars had to align for this to happen and scotland had to suffer an uncomfortable amount of wind - but it 's still pretty awesome . 
  congrats scotland . 
  we 've all been there :(, 
  it 's not 50/50 , it 's 40 leave/45 remain . 
  or , if you want to use the other poll which ( imo ) is a bit more descriptive/accurate : * in the eu and not part of the uk : 37 % * part of the uk and not in the eu : 46 %, 
  the latest polls show that more scots would rather stay in the uk outside of the eu than stay in the eu outside of the uk . 
  she knows she knows that there 's no chance she 'll be able to get some kind of special status with the eu allowing scotland to do both , so she 's ( thankfully ) given up on the idea and looking for the best way to proceed . 
  interesting ... thanks for explaining . 
  i do n't understand what links the hotel pictures to the video . 
  am i just being really dumb here ? 
  the guys in the video have their faces covered . 
  the sky news guy says the pictures from the hotel are just his tv crew . 
  what bit am i missing ? 
  twitter does n't seem to be helping me understand , it just seems to be lots of people ( presumably romanian ) repeating the claim that he 's lying . 
  send it to me , i 'll sort it for you . 
  english articles : * http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-08-10/bomb-threats-reported-on-two-planes-due-to-land-at-brussels/ * http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/bomb-alert-two-brussels-bound-8604198 * http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brussels-airport-bomb-latest-updates-alert-passenger-jets-airline-live-a7183351.html < - best not much info yet . 
  however , this is curious : `` the alerts were radioed in the from the aircraft to air traffic control '' . 
  i figured someone tipped off the police about a potential threat and they 're grounding planes to be safe , but this sounds like the threat came from a plane ? 
  ** edit : ** first belgian bomb threat believed on sas sk4745 from oslo ( landed safely ) unconfirmed 2nd is w62283 from budapest : https://www.flightradar24.com/wzz3nl/aa1241b  belgian journalist bart raes , who was on one of the flights , tweeted to say the pilot had entered the cabin 20 minutes before landing , saying there may be a bomb on the plane .
