   covering the leaders ' speeches at the last election in small towns in the north west and midlands , i was struck by how often the same incident would be raised by people in the audience , or by minicab drivers you 'd meet on the way : how in october 2014 , david cameron had been presented by his european colleagues with a bill for an extra # 1.7 bn due to an upwards revision of britain 's gni , and how the pm 's insistence he would not pay , and george osborne 's claim it had been halved , were later shown to be untrue . 
   the way one financial times story among thousands in the year 's news cycle had lodged in public 's mind was , in hindsight , a clue to the trouble coming cameron 's way . 
  but what was really striking was how sharply people could recall the details of an arcane european budget revision - a process we are often told the general public does not understand . 
  they were angry , and well-informed . 
   a common response to the brexit vote , particularly in brussels , was to explain that ignorant british voters had been hoodwinked by a campaign of now-discredited lies ( the now-notorious # 350 million a week saving , the turks , an eu army and so on ) . 
   the impression is reinforced by tv vox pops with tattooed slobs , some of whom offered plainly irrational reasons -- such as wanting to end non-eu migration -- for voting out ; and stories that britons were `` frantically googling '' what the eu is , hours after leaving . 
   no public informed of the `` facts '' about europe , the argument runs , could sensibly reject membership ; and indeed european institutions have spent millions on information campaigns and initiatives such as the parliamentarium lights-and-sounds visitors centre in brussels , in the belief that greater understanding of how the institutions operate will result in growing support . 
   the american socialist ronald inglehart , writing in 1970 , called this the cognitive mobilisation thesis -- that as voters became more educated about europe , they will find the institutions `` more familiar , less threatening '' . 
   such a theory would , at first glance , sit alongside a demographic analysis , which points to a stark cleavage between graduates , who tended to vote to remain , and those with a basic education , who tended towards leave . 
  and it would concur with studies that show britons have among the lowest factual knowledge about the eu in europe . 
   for those who believe in the project , it is a comforting assumption . 
  but intriguingly , it is not well supported by studies that attempted to examined the link between knowledge about europe and attitudes . 
   indeed , what if the opposite is true : that the more voters see of brussels , the less they like it ? 
   what happened after the vote should give us a clue . 
   if it was the case , as widely posited after the result , that the leave campaign 's # 350 million claim was pivotal , then we might see voters change their mind as it became apparent that no such saving would be found for `` our nhs '' . 
   yet polling shows no ` bregret ' -- a yougov survey earlier this week showed 52 % of voters think leaving was right and 48 % wrong , mirroring the referendum result . 
  voters , it appears , were confident in their initial analysis . 
   in may 2015 , eurobarometer , the european commission 's in-house pollster , combined its regular attitude polling with a knowledge test . 
  respondents were asked to give true or false to the following statements : the eu currently consists of 28 member states ; the members of the european parliament are directly elected by the citizens of each member state ; switzerland is a member state of the eu . 
  only 27 per cent of brits could answer all three correctly , a rate beating only latvia . 
   yet there was little discernable relationship between knowledge and favourability . 
   among the group of brits who said they had a `` very positive '' image of the eu , 86 per cent could answer at least one question correctly , while 41 per cent could answer all three . 
   among those with a `` very negative '' perception , 92 per cent could get one question right , while 33 per cent could answer all three . 
   `` in other words , learning more about the eu may be just as likely to lead people to have a negative view of the eu as a positive view , '' noted prof simon hix of lse , who studied the polling . 
   it is consistent with other studies . 
   in 2005 -- the year of the double referendum defeat for the constitutional treaty - researchers at lund university examined eurobarometer surveys to plot the percentage of respondents who regarded membership as a `` bad thing '' , against those who said they were aware of the european parliament from 1992-2001 . 
   the results were messy . 
   while theoreticians such as inglehart had `` predicted that as levels of awareness and knowledge of the eu increased then levels of euroscepticism would decrease '' , they wrote , in fact , `` in this investigation no evidence of such a relationship was found . ''  and perhaps most intriguingly , in 2003 a team of researchers from university of twente in the netherlands concluded that , contrary to inglehart 's thesis , the more voters understand about european democracy the less satisfied they become . 
   what 's more , the idea that voters attitudes to the eu is simply a mirror of how they feel about their own government is also mistaken , they said . 
   they graded knowledge based on voters ' ability to identify the european commission president and their national eu commissioner , finance minister and foreign minister , while attitudes to the eu were drawn from eurobarometer surveys on whether voters considered the european parliament trustworthy and powerful . 
   the researchers noticed that the better-informed voters would distinguish much more clearly between their national institutions and the eu . 
   and the greater a voters ' level of political knowledge , the more satisfied they became with the functioning of their own democracies , but the less content they became with european democracy , which the researchers suggested was due to its lack of accountability and responsiveness . 
   [ the university of twente study - entitled to know it is to love it ? 
  - suggested that satisfaction with the eu fell as knowledge increased - while the reverse was true of national democracies . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/08/10/karp-large_trans++vwudfcwenpy3ps2hnvubbvidv92eghamnyuviw-i0ai.jpg )  among the least-well informed voters , the satisfaction gap between national and european politicians was around 5 points , rising to 20 points for the best-informed . 
   `` those who are the most knowledgeable are more likely to view the democratic performance of the eu with scepticism , '' they wrote . 
   whether voters in britain exercised good judgement - whether it was all worth it - is the debate for the coming decades . 
  but from the research we have , it suggests supporters of the european project will need to fight with more than facts alone to turn back the eurosceptic tide . 
  did n't realise it was a soft paywall . 
  i 'll copy/paste into this thread . 
  ** edit : ** why the -1 ? 
  / r/europe you are a fucking weird bunch . 
  as is the eu ;-), 
  i 'm picturing the towns drunks all rolling around in the street . 
  glad it does n't sound like anyone else is in danger , aside from the loon on the roof . 
  does n't sound like any kind of terror attack , fortunately , but it probably does raise some questions about what he 's using as an explosive and how easy it was for him to get it ( assuming he actually has some ) . 
  ** edit : ** looks like he 's been arrested . 
  ** edit 2 : ** i posted this 4 hours ago and it 's only just appeared . 
  nothing to see here , carry on . 
  considering afghanistan just joined wto , i do n't think it 'll be that big of an issue . 
  renegotiation of wto is due to start as soon as we invoke a50 . 
  then i think you had a very different experience of the referendum than me , or anyone i know . 
  lets distil the items listed above into topics : pros : * opportunities/travel/economy * working together for things like climate change and protection of workers rights * cooperation * protection against russia cons : * giving powers away * dilution of culture/identity * favours big business * democratic deficit * the way it affects different countries depending on their size/economy all of those topics were covered in detail in every debate . 
  that has already been thoroughly debunked . 
  but do n't let me stop your circle jerk . 
  did n't you hear enough of this during the referendum ? 
  these exact arguments were regurgitated over and over again ... 
  quite a lot . 
  depends what you 're comparing it to . 
  have you ever been ? 
  what do you think it 's lacking ? 
  java ? 
  not for a long time . 
  the world is changing . 
  love it or hate it , javascript is taking over . 
  web , mobile and even encroaching on desktop apps . . 
  same as my experience . 
  i left school 16 years ago , though , so i imagine it has changed . 
  keep out of this , finn , with your ... woah , only 0.8 % ? 
  in this sub it 's quite hard to distinguish sarcasm from brit-hate . 
  you 're seriously attempting to argue that the main reason other countries learn english is because the english do n't learn many other languages ? 
  touched a nerve have i , swede ? 
  odd . 
  maybe related to region , or maybe just coincidence !, 
  no they 're not . 
  it 'll be compulsory soon enough . 
  i 'm quite surprised that uk is french/spanish . 
  my experience is that most people learnt either basic french or german . 
  so why make a point about him fixing a typo ? 
  an attempt to try to make him look stupid , perchance ? 
  not that it really matters . 
  just seemed weird to point that out . 
  whats wrong with someone correcting a typo ? 
   the plan to make a federal united europe is finished / r/europe on suicide watch, 
  huge water pumps that 'd cause strong currents which push the boats across the atlantic . 
  simple !, 
  good stuff !, 
  red means awesome , right ? 
  no , that 's what our army are for . 
  if the army ca n't do it , maybe usa will help . 
  if usa wont do it , we 've got our nukes . 
  i 'm a global elite in cs : go , but i do n't think that 'd transfer too well to real life . 
  i 'm a programmer so could probably help out in some kind of cyber war . 
  ah fuck off you silly cunt .
