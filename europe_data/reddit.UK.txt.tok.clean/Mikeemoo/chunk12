  most of us that voted leave knew it 'd have an impact on the economy . 
  this is n't unexpected . 
   bank of england governor mark carney : uk 's decision to leave eu marks a regime change & some adjustments to this new reality will take time, 
  because the majority in scotland and ni want to be part of the uk whereas the majority in the uk do n't want to be part of the eu ? 
  surely that makes it a very different argument . 
  you `` really hope '' that a centuries old union breaks down because it 'd be `` hilarious '' ? 
  i hope your country breaks up too . 
  that 'd be hilarious . 
  what a dick thing to say . 
  just need to increase automation . 
  people have invented machines that can do these kinds of jobs ( lettuce picking . . etc. 
  ) , but we do n't invest in them because it 's been so easy to import cheap labour . 
  as an england man with some irish family , this is probably one of the only times i 've actually heard anyone speaking irish . 
  sounds like an awesome language . 
  tempted to try to learn it . 
  we must 've been reading different sources of history . 
  the end of all faith schools . 
  yorkshire tea bags . 
  e : woah , why the downvotes ? 
  e2 : now i look stupid . 
  i think there 's some debate as to how much should or should n't be in the curriculum . 
  the curriculum may have changed a lot since i was a lad , but it certainly was n't one of the core themes we learned about ( like the world wars , the tudors & stuarts . 
  etc. ), 
  i very rarely see people say that . 
  no more than i see other silly things said online from a variety of other minority opinion groups in other countries . 
  i often see german idiots spamming youtube comments about how hilter was right , but i know that does n't reflect the opinion of the vast majority of germans . 
  as for whether the `` empire '' was a good or a bad thing , i do n't think it 's as simple as making it binary like that . 
  either way , it 's not something that people in the uk ever talk or care about . 
  it 's something we 're barely taught about in school . 
  it 's a mostly closed chapter in the public consciousness . 
  i 've read the article , but must 've missed it . 
  what are the questions about nationalism ? 
  also , i ca n't say i 've met many people that i 'd ever consider to be `` nationalists '' . 
  i 've met a few patriots , sure , but most people i know are just as cynical about britain just as they are about the rest of the world . 
   longer it takes to say clearly if the uk is `` in '' or `` out '' , more damages it 'll cause to the uk . 
  the uk has ** very ** clearly said it 's ** out ** . 
  the prime minister has repeatedly said it , the government has set up new departments for handling it . 
  there is nothing unclear about it . 
   there shall be more social tensions nonsense . 
  you think we 're on the brink of civil war or something ? 
  a tiny handful of racist idiots felt empowered when the vote happened , that 's all . 
  most of the emotional response to the referendum has died down already - i barely hear anyone mention it outside of reddit these days . 
  ( obviously there 's mentions of it on the news , but most social discourse has died off )  more businesses shall leave the uk ( for the eu ) will they ? 
  where 's the evidence for that ? 
   and it may go worse ... and it is contagious should i be boarding up my windows and buying tinned food right now ? 
  i assume you do n't live in the uk , because i think you 're extremely misled . 
  is it really ? 
  i keep seeing people repeat this , yet there 's absolutely no evidence to suggest that it wo n't happen , but a huge amount of evidence that suggests it will . 
  the biggest reason people think it wo n't happen is because they 're waiting until next year until they trigger a50 . 
  we were in no position to be triggering a50 straight away . 
  new government departments are being formed and lots of groundwork is being put in . 
  this takes time . 
  clutching at straws a bit there . 
  hahaha good catch . 
  i think he 's referring to the guys unbuttoned shirt . 
  i would n't exactly call it common . . but on hot days you 'll occasionally see people with their shirt unbuttoned . 
  bloody cheats . 
  if they 're not cheating in counter-strike they 're cheating in nobel laureates !, 
  a version showing per capita would be cool , too . 
  thanks !, 
  man , i love listening to germans shout . 
  best language for shouting . 
  any estimates on the amount of people ? 
  it 's hard to tell from the stream whether it 's thousands or just a couple of lines of people behind the banner . 
  thanks for the insult . 
  i always appreciate an insult . 
  i 'd have linked to the tweets about it because it 's clearer , but i do n't think / r/europe allow twitter links . 
  should scotland be an independent country ? 
  = = = * yes : 40 % * no : 45 % which of these statements do you tend to agree with more ? 
  = = = * i would rather live in a scotland that was a member of the european union but not a part of the united kingdom : 37 % * i would rather live in a scotland that was a part of the united kingdom but not a member of the european union : 46 % which of these statements do you tend to agree with more ? 
  = = = * i would rather live in a scotland that was a part of the united kingdom but not a member of the single market : 40 % * i would rather live in a scotland that was a member of the single market but not a part of the united kingdom : 34 % full breakdown is in the pdf . 
  what is the snp doing that can be classed as `` got its shit together '' ? 
  i 'm interested to know . 
  do they need to build more schools in scotland ? 
  it seems like it . 
  still better even if you do n't . 
  completely unsurprising . 
  polls only had independence very slightly ahead before , and that was just after the eu referendum where emotions were high . 
  it was bound to drop below 50 % within weeks . 
  it 'll drop further still . 
  sturgeon is an embarrassment - she 's always saying `` scotland wants this , scotland wants that '' , but the polls always show she 's talking about ** snp ** wanting this or that , not the majority of people in scotland . 
  keeping the peace , deescalation of violence , arresting the bad guys , saying `` allo , allo , allo , what 's all this then ? '', 
  hopefully we 're not !, 
  are you really that ignorant or are you trying to make a joke ? 
  hrmm . . need me to come over and help ? 
   it is the only non-governmental forecasting group to use hm treasury 's model of the uk economy . 
  our reports provide a detailed economic analysis and forecast of economic activity for the period ahead . 
  they are independent of any political , economic or business bias . 
  nice attempt to avoid supplying any evidence for the claims you 've made , though . 
  just skirt around the issue , eh ? 
  here , have some more : http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/235  the impact of immigration into the uk on gdp per head -- a key measure of prosperity - is essentially negligible . 
   on the impact of immigration on average wage levels , the evidence is varied , but there is broad agreement that immigration has harmed the earnings of the most poorly-paid uk-born members of the labour force as well as those in the semi-unskilled service sector . 
  i keenly await any evidence you have to back up your claim . 
   this is all still speculation , and the opinion of a committee . 
  you know full well that it 's not as simple has just having `` hard data '' in a nice single table . 
  the point of the select committee report is to combine relevant sets of data with expert opinion to get an overview of what the bigger picture is . 
  but here , i 'll copy and paste some more for you because i 'm not convinced you 've read more than the first paragraph . 
   the national institute of economic and social research ( niesr ) estimated that immigration during the period 1998 -- 2005 contributed to a rise in real gdp of about 3 % . 
  however , the research by the niesr also suggests that immigrants during that period made up 3.8 % of the population , which suggests that immigration had a slightly negative impact on gdp per capita . 
  however , this gdp estimate captures the effects of an increase in the supply of labour only .
