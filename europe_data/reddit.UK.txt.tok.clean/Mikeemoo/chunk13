  it does not take account of the further increase in gdp that would result from an increase in capital . 
  if capital is factored in , this could lead to gdp estimates showing a slightly positive impact on gdp per head . 
   ...  according to the item club , the impact of the most recent wave of immigration on gdp per capita has been neutral or even slightly negative . 
   ...  the overall conclusion from existing evidence is that immigration has very small impacts on gdp per capita , whether these impacts are positive or negative . 
  this conclusion is in line with findings of studies of the economic impacts of immigration in other countries including the us .37 the government should initiate research in this area , in view of the paucity of evidence for the uk . 
  all of the sources are cited within the report . 
  i 'm still awaiting your evidence or report that says `` eu migration has contributed far more to the british economy than they have taken . 
  i 'm considering a career change into the security sector . 
  it 's from a house of lords select committee . 
  it says so on the first page . 
  there 's also a full list of witnesses on page 64 .

  there 's little to no data . 
  what exactly is it that you think it 's missing ? 
  it goes into considerable detail . 
  did you read it all ? 
  can you provide any evidence to back up your claim that immigration helps the economy ? 
  my armed guard could clear some space for me ... 
   and in all the replies here , not one mentions the important economic contribution polish people , or any other central and eastern european migrants , have made to the british economy . 
   ...  stop the bullshit and look at the facts ok , lets look at the facts . 
  https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldselect/ldeconaf/82/82.pdf  immigration has become highly significant to the uk economy : immigrants comprise 12 % of the total workforce -- and a much higher proportion in london . 
  however , we have found no evidence for the argument , made by the government , business and many others , that net immigration -- immigration minus emigration -- generates significant economic benefits for the existing uk population . 
   overall gdp , which the government has persistently emphasised , is an irrelevant and misleading criterion for assessing the economic impacts of immigration on the uk . 
  the total size of an economy is not an index of prosperity . 
  the focus of analysis should rather be on the effects of immigration on income per head of the resident population . 
  both theory and the available empirical evidence indicate that these effects are small , especially in the long run when the economy fully adjusts to the increased supply of labour . 
  in the long run , the main economic effect of immigration is to enlarge the economy , with relatively small costs and benefits for the incomes of the resident population . 
   ...  rising population density has potentially important economic consequences for the resident population , including impacts on housing , as well as wider welfare effects , especially in parts of england where immigrants are most concentrated . 
  although immigration is only one of a number of factors affecting the demand for housing , it does exert a significant impact on the housing market in particular areas . 
  some of the wider impacts from rising population are hard to measure and highly regional . 
  some , such as the impact of increasing population density on the cost and speed of implementation of public infrastructure projects , remain poorly understood . 
  your turn . 
  quite a misleading title there . 
  `` british tourists in france to be accompanied by armed guards '' = `` there will be more security in france '' . 
  people wo n't be walking around with their own bodyguards ... although , that 'd be kinda cool . 
  complete and utter bullshit . 
  23.8 % of gdp spent on military . 
  top quality reporting . 
  the papers follow the stories that 'll make them the most money . 
  `` everything is going wrong '' stories sell better than `` urhm , it 's shaky , but things are n't too bad just yet . 
  it 's too early to tell '' stories . 
  my biggest gripe about the `` ignorance '' argument is that there 's plenty of ignorant people on both sides of the argument , but that 's the same with almost everything political . 
  there 's only a handful of people in the country who have a detailed understanding of the intricacies of any particular part of it ( security , trade or whatever else ) , and i think it 's fairly unlikely that there 's ** anyone ** at all who has a very detailed understanding of the entire thing . 
  the head of mi5 does n't know everything about trade , and the bank of england do n't know everything about security . 
  we had months of constant tv programmes about brexit , so it was fairly inescapable - however in the end the majority of the population voted based on gut feeling about the core concepts along with a vague idea of the potential risk vs. reward , however obviously a few people voted with little understanding ( `` fucking immigrants '' / `` i just want us to love everybody '' ) . 
  it 's frustrating to see 20-somethings on tv saying `` i feel like people who voted leave did n't know what they were voting for '' , yet when quizzed about the eu they knew next to nothing about it themselves . 
  from all of the programmes i 've watched about brexit ( and i 've watched pretty much every programme i can find ) , most ` leavers ' knew it 'd be a hit to the economy in the short and medium term , but did n't care . 
  pluriculturalism at its finest . 
  i saw a video a couple of days ago of someone interviewing dutch people - `` what do you think about brexit ? '', 
  - `` i think it was a huge mistake . 
  i think brits do n't know what they were voting for and they do n't understand the eu '' `` what do you like about the eu ? '', 
  - `` well , erm . . hmm . 
  ermmm ... well . . hmm . 
  free movement of people ? 
  i guess . . '' it felt a lot like they thought brits made a mistake because the media told them the brits made a mistake . . 
  why are germans not having children ? 
  sex attack !, 
   it is basically having full single market access for the most important sectors while completely shielding off your labour market . 
  she did n't say full single market access . 
  my guess is that we 'll exchange single market access in certain areas for some controls on free movement . 
  looks like it 's nothing . 
  hmm , i thought it was for the council , not the commission . 
  00:03 quietly , 00:06 is clearer , 00:10 quietly . 
  germans are the best in the world at sounding angry . 
  nice attempt . 
  show me the thread where you 've shown `` your '' studies and other people have provided `` their '' studies , then . 
  it sounds almost as though you 're struggling to back up your claim with any kind of evidence at all . 
   i think gays can be wonderful human beings ... but kids still needs two parents of opposite gender . 
  that is not negotiable - a disaster , a sudden death can take away one or both parents from a kid , and we usually recognize that as the tragedy it is . 
  to give kids in adoption to an homosexual couple is a travesty . 
  what ? 
  why exactly do they need to be opposite gender ? 
  yes , it 's a tragedy if a kids parent dies , but not because of the gender imbalance !, 
  again , show me some evidence that same sex parents have any negative impact on a child . 
   yeah , there are relatives around but who cares ? 
  kids have always been in uk , its less traumatic for them to go to complete strangers ( nevermind the gay part for a second ) instead than just go to thei damn home country with their real family . 
  they 're british born kids who do n't speak romanian ( in fact , the new parents are encouraging them to learn it ) . 
  how do you know the extended family are n't complete strangers to them ? 
  you think it 's better for them to go and live in a foreign country , with people they might not know , where everyone speaks a language they do n't understand ? 
  and why are you so hung up about them being a gay couple ? 
  you seem to be assuming that these children share your own prejudices . 
  are there any studies that show being brought up by a gay couple has any negative effect on children ? 
   oh , well , they took kids that didnt want to leave their parents where does it say that ? 
  social services would n't have just suddenly taken their children away . 
  it would have been after a very long process , where the couple had many chances to calm their behaviour and realise the potential damage they 're causing . 
   florin and claudia came to the social workers ' attention around 2010 and after frequent visits from them and the police , the children were removed from their home in 2014, 
  sounds to me like their kids will be far happier and have a far better life with their new parents . 
  which is completely irrelevant to this report . . 
  just got ta turn them up to 11 to counteract the downward forces . 
  i did n't vote at all because it would n't have improved things a great deal . 
  i 'd rather wait until ( if ever ) we get a referendum on a proper alternative . 
  and because i 'm lazy . 
  glory to the european union and glory to the supreme leaders !, 
  hail the united states of europe and the free movement of people within our single supreme glorious nation . 
  woah that 's a bit harsh . 
  why would n't he give a fuck about ireland ? 
  do you know him ? 
  the first link seems to just show that less people want a referendum . 
  that 's very different to `` wanting more integration '' . 
  the second link seems completely irrelevant .
