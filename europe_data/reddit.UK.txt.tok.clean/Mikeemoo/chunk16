  right , so lets all ignore what he said , lets ignore everything that has been said repeatedly for the past few months , lets ignore that we 're setting up new governmental departments for global trade and for brexit , and instead lets focus on the fact that the bbc news website put three words in quotes . 
   i think that guy with the laminated `` no more polish vermin '' cards , would beg to differ . 
  or that arsonist who set fire to that jewish owned romanian shop in norwich . 
  a 50 % + increase in xenophobic attracts telling immigrants to go home , is by no means `` nobody '' . 
  ah ok , so you 're talking about the nutters that make up 0.0001 % of this country , like in every other country . 
   i could n't possibly bothered to go trough that mountain of idiotic affirmations from the campaign , so why do n't you bring me a statement where he says the words `` in any sense '' about europe or the eu , prior to this one . 
  you 're the person making the idiotic claim . 
  if you want to claim someone has said something you should back it up . 
  we have far less reason to speak other languages than most european countries . 
  ^ this . 
  the sample size is so small that 1 person shifts it by 1 % . 
  huge margin of error . 
  it 's not exactly an unexpected change , anyway - `` ukip supporters '' refers to people that intend to vote for ukip in the next election . 
  brexit is happening . 
  these people may have wanted to stay in the eu but intend to vote for ukip because ukips other policies appeal to them ( or more likely that the other parties do n't appeal to them ) . 
  `` who ** now ** think leaving the eu is wrong '' is very misleading , because there 's no way of knowing whether they wanted to be in the eu before , and there 's no way of knowing whether they were ukip supporters before . 
  in fact , it 's highlighted by the fact that only 5 % of people regret their vote yet 7 % of ` ukip supporters ' wish we did n't leave . 
  i 'm surprised that a site called politicalbetting.com is so inept at interpreting opinion polls . 
  do n't worry , they are . 
  yes , i think the middle class mother who owns three businesses in sunny spain , and likely has absolutely no intention in returning to the uk anyway , is going to become a terrorist . 
  we should have a small one , just for old times sake . 
  keeping traditions alive . 
  can someone give me a quick overview of m\u00e9lenchon ? 
  he seems to be a far left anti-globalisation pro-immigration eu-critic ? 
  nooo you do n't understand . 
  women who decide to take 10 years out of their career to bring up children should totally be able to come back into management positions . 
  the fact that they 've missed out of 10 years of vital experience is absolutely irrelevant , you misogynist pig !, 
  equality for all !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ except ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ criminal ^ ^ ^ ^ justice ^ ^ ^ ^ system , ^ ^ ^ ^ matters ^ ^ ^ ^ around ^ ^ ^ ^ child ^ ^ ^ ^ custody , ^ ^ ^ ^ mental ^ ^ ^ ^ health ^ ^ ^ ^ support ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ domestic ^ ^ ^ ^ abuse ^ ^ ^ ^ support . 
  does this mean he 'll be on my tv less ? 
  maybe him and farage can keep quiet now and leave it to the grown ups . 
  the turd that wo n't flush . . 
  i wonder how many times this misleading headline is going to be posted . 
  ... during a transitional period ... 
  what makes it extra sad is that her boyfriend ( who survived ) had planned to propose to her on the day that the attack happened . 
  world peace is pretty important to me , but if asked in a survey what the most important issues facing the country are , i 'd probably put nhs , immigration and the economy . 
  no , it means that we had to decide whether or not to leave the eu . 
  of course it would make it the most important issue facing the country . 
  it will stay the most important issue for years to come . 
  all that graph shows is how important ( out of a list of various issues ) people consider the particular topic to be at a given time . 
  worse in what way ? 
  is anyone even slightly surprised by this graph ? 
  if you have to decide whether or not your country is going to spend its future within the eu or outside of the eu , it becomes a pretty important issue . 
  just untick `` use subreddit style '', 
  i am . 
  yes, 
  she is specifically talking about an issue that involves both the christian religion and the national trust . 
  this is a pretty poor attempt of a shitpost . 
  no , lets not . 
  shock . 
  the uk flag was being constantly attacked by posters of / r/europe . 
  our alliance with italy was harmonious . 
  much of our time was spent making sure nasty pixels did n't hurt italy . 
  ... except it was n't , was it ? 
  it even says `` the world 's greatest comic '' , `` weather : slightly gay '' and `` get your daily dose of hate '' in the image you posted you 're as gullible as fuck . 
  i started doing the flag on the right , but then they started expanding the left flag into a proper shape - so we ended up with two . 
  we 're going back to a single flag now . 
  low quality ? 
  a bit like your modding abilities . 
  this video is quite different to the others in the series . 
  here 's the rest of his videos from the past few days : https://www.youtube.com/user/timcasts/videos, 
  i 'm amazed that you ca n't work out such a simple conundrum yourself . 
  here'e his ( still ongoing ) video series if anyone is interested : https://www.youtube.com/user/timcasts/videos so far he 's mostly just been interviewing people in pre-arranged interviews . 
  i 'm hoping he 'll actually do something a bit more raw than this . 
   immigration was estimated to be 596,000 in ye sept 2016 , ( down 23,000 ( not statistically significant ) from ye sept 2015 ) ; comprising 268,000 eu citizens , 257,000 non-eu citizens and 71,000 british citizens, 
  a couple of remainers from the opposition party do , based on no evidence . 
  such a dumb article . 
  is the headline written in english ? 
   pineapple, 
   hate to be awkward but i use km when i 'm hiking or running as just sounds like you 're using tech that was n't directly designed for a uk market . 
  roads and speedometers are primarily in miles . 
  rank | city | population -- | -- | -- 1 | paris | 2,152,000 2 | marseille | 808,000 3 | lyon | 422,000 4 | toulouse | 366,000 5 | nice | 346,000 6 | ** london ** | 270,000 frenchies 7 | strasbourg | 256,000 8 | nantes | 252,000, 
  we have made up our mind . 
  we use miles . 
  someone complaining about wasting money on sign posts in a unit of measurement we generally do n't use is n't exactly `` crazy '' . 
  we mostly use miles here . 
  putting signs up in km is a waste of time and money . 
  there 's `` fear '' of the channel tunnel , is there ? 
  how many years experience of rioting do you have ? 
  any idea what the approximate roi is ? 
   cherries , strawberries , blueberries , lettuce , etc , need to be handpicked all of this stuff has been automatable for a very long time . 
  there 's plenty of farmers in the uk that have said they 're looking at automation . 
  so maybe you should tell them they 're wrong , not me . 
  so , let me fire it back at you . 
  `` what a dumb comment '' . 
   half acre veggie farm, 
  uk farmers need to stop relying on dirt cheap foreign labour and actually invest in automation . 
  automation for most of this stuff has existed for a very long time . 
  colour me surprised . 
  that 's kind of him . 
   inappropriate invitations to go out on dates ? 
  surely it depends on what people in that country consider to be sexual harassment . 
  in some countries giving someone flirty eyes across the bar might be considered harassment , or overhearing someone tell a friend a crude joke . 
  in other countries it could be very different . 
  maybe it had something like my [ cnc machine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkwcgxtwhsk&amp;t=38s ) attached . 
  it 's going through parliament at the moment . 
  impressive drone camera technology for the time . 
  i 'd be happy to see them swap . 
  tony blair is a cunt bubble . 
  what a waste of bandwidth .
