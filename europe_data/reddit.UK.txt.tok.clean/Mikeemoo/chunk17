  * 20/day . 
  # 10 for a 20 box * ~ 45 days = 900 cigarettes ( 45 boxes , # 450 ) * ~ 4 minutes per smoke = 3600 minutes ( 60 hours / 2.5 days ), 
  i gave up smoking on new years day and worked out that i 've saved myself around 60 hours worth of standing outside in the cold , not to mention about # 450 . 
  political/referendum campaigns use every possible attack . 
  it does n't make them a ` main attack ' by any means . 
  scotland did n't give a flying fuck about the eu until after the referendum ( and the snp realised it was a stick to beat the tories with ) . 
  only out of habit . 
  per capita would be more interesting, 
  that 'd make sense if the majority of sikhs and hindus did n't vote for brexit . 
  this programme is called hardtalk . 
  the concept of the programme is to fire very hard-hitting questions about sensitive topics , not creating real discussions . 
  we have other programmes for real discussions . 
  because it 's not a real poll . 
  it 's a self-selecting google survey on a pro-remain website . 
  no it would n't . 
  this was a fucking self selecting ** google survey ** from a media outlet that supported us remaining within the eu . 
  please stop with the bullshit stories . 
  the deputy speaker , lindsay hoyle , would do a fine job . 
  source that says this meeting was under chatham house rules ? 
   he assumed he was talking freely , and definitely not being recorded source ? 
  he was invited to the university in his official position as speaker . 
  this was not some hand-held video camera . 
   every single person triggered by this is a leaver . 
  what a coinkidink not true at all . 
  in fact , i 'm currently listening to lbc radio and the presenter is a remain supporter that is furious about what the speaker did . 
   a view he revealed privately , in confidence , does not break impartiality he said his views on trump officially in the house on commons & on live tv . 
  you 're calling me a hypocrite based on an opinion you 've projected onto me ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  ah i see , so breaking impartiality is good if he supports the same views as you ? 
  if you ca n't respect democracy you do n't deserve a democracy . 
  yes , in the same way that i was annoyed that the media were reporting that the queen commented on brexit , even though what she was reported to have said supported my views . 
  people in this thread are missing why this is such a big issue . 
  not only is he meant to stay absolutely politically neutral ( even in retirement ) , but he 's also going to be chairing the upcoming debates related to brexit . 
  in my opinion , this makes his position untenable . 
  he did n't just say whether he voted to leave or remain , he discussed the reasons.etc . 
  if he had only once breached his impartiality i think people would be less concerned , but he has done it twice in the past couple of weeks on the biggest issues of the day . 
  ** edit : ** am i seriously getting downvoted to -7 for saying that someone in a fundamentally politically neutral position should stay politically fucking neutral ? 
  jesus christ / r/europe , how new are you to this democracy thing ? 
  i 'm not sure you 're cut out for it . 
  thanks !, 
  for what reason ? 
  can we all just please revert to our traditional stereotypes now please ? 
  these new ones are getting out of hand . 
  i 'll wear a monocle and top hat if you commit to carrying a baguette , riding a bicycle and painting . 
  this is good . 
  muslims, 
  why change the headline ? 
  \\* people, 
  estimate is about 57.76 % leave, 
  this small area in middlesbrough had a 82.51 % leave vote . 
  this is less detailed . 
  both the uk government and the roi government saying they seek to continue having an open border . 
  i think everyone is aware of the potential problems that having a hard border would cause , so i imagine it 'll be a priority to resolve the issue . 
  it 's unlikely that there will be a hard border . 
  ni will leave the eu just like the rest of the uk . 
  a ` multi-lane ' eu assumes that everyone is heading towards further integration but at different speeds . 
  i 'm not sure everyone in the eu wants further integration , no matter the speed . 
  i have a dream that spammers like you will fuck off . 
  if you ever did have a referendum it 'd depend a lot on how competent your campaigning teams are and how well they 're able to put their message across . 
  here 's a uk poll from dec 2015 , 6 months before the referendum : ** should the united kingdom remain a member of the european union or leave the european union ? 
  ** * remain : 58 % * leave : 32 % * undecided : 10 % quite a large swing !, 
  the latest european yougov poll i can find , from aug/sept has this : ** if there was a referendum on country 's membership of the european union , how would you vote ? 
  ** country | remain | leave | wo n't vote | do n't know -- | -- | -- | -- | -- uk | 43 % | 45 % | 7 % | 6 % italy | 47 % | 33 % | 7 % | 13 % france | 44 % | 31 % | 9 % | 15 % sweden | 48 % | 31 % | 2 % | 18 % finland | 51 % | 30 % | 5 % | 14 % the netherlands | 49 % | 29 % | 8 % | 13 % denmark | 58 % | 28 % | 1 % | 13 % germany | 57 % | 26 % | 5 % | 13 % lithuania | 66 % | 21 % | 8 % | 6 % poland | 63 % | 18 % | 8 % | 10 % romania | 70 % | 17 % | 7 % | 7 % spain | 62 % | 15 % | 8 % | 15 % so , not too high right now . 
  however , referendum campaigning could potentially swing it . 
  before the brexit campaigns started , the uk had similar polls to what france has now . 
  i would rather have a pint with hitler than with her . 
  laurie penny is weird . 
  extreme left wing virtue signaller . 
  here , waste 6 minutes of your life : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj9da6e3fjw, 
  not cool . 
  should have been like this to start with . 
  3-4 blocks , but with some underlying corporation between those blocks ( such as corporation on projects.etc . ), 
  it 'd freak me out to see something like that go through my town . 
  the woman was trolling . 
  the clip is cut off , but she went on to explain the real reason being that she thinks there 's opportunities in brexit . 
  agreed, 
  i imagine the intention was to take control of the soldiers weapon . 
  never take a knife to a gun fight, 
  sky news says this :  a french soldier has opened fire after a man tried to enter the louvre museum in paris carrying a suitcase , local media have said . 
   a police source told reuters news agency the man was armed with a knife and had been trying to get into an underground shop at the museum . 
   france 's interior ministry said on twitter that a serious security incident was under way at the popular attraction , which has been cordoned off . 
  of course it 's a wishlist . 
  it 's not an unrealistic one , though . 
  the uk has things that the eu wants , too . 
  the italian deputy foreign minister was on the bbc last night saying he thinks it 's achievable , and there 's been other similar noises coming out of europe . 
  the `` absolutely no cherry picking '' stance is from the extreme hardliners like guy verhofstadt , but it 's not a pragmatic stance . 
  when most leaders are talking about cherry picking they 're just referring to the single market . 
  does this upset you ? 
  cool !, 
  i 've never seen this before . 
  except for the other thousand times it 's been posted . 
  buying stuff is over-rated . 
   crown pussycution service !, 
   big bro bad boys ' all night x-rated party !, 
  most of the uk never sees it anyway . 
  off the top of my head , she 's met bashar al-assad and robert mugabe . 
  i believe there 's plenty more , though . 
   because it would cause embarrassment to her majesty the queen . 
  simply not true . 
  the queen would n't be embarrassed meeting the donald .
