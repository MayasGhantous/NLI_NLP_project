  if there 's 5 random people in some private chat room plotting silly shit , i do n't think it 's such an issue . 
  if there 's thousands of people it 's probably newsworthy . 
  he 's saying they 'll move if there 's big import tariffs on hardware . 
  i do n't think that will be a problem . 
  the intention of the government is not to become protectionist . 
  some of our education is amazing , we have lots of universities in the top world rankings . . etc. 
  however , a lot of our education is absolutely shite . 
  high school education is a hot topic over here at the moment . 
  low production & education, 
  he 's talking about multilateral deals , not bilateral deals . 
  he 's also talking about the eu , not the us . 
  the eu is very slow at negotiating deals , whereas the us are known for being very efficient at trade deals . 
  not surprising ... ireland is in the eu . 
  it is not in the usa , nor in the uk . 
  the average time for a us bilateral trade deal is 16 months . 
  it took the us and australia 13 months to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement . 
  no , we down vote you because you 've been on a constant hate campaign against the uk , and persons of the uk , for the past 6 months . 
  yus , that sounds right . 
  expected 2030, 
  what reason does the eu have for being against the uk negotiating new deals ? 
  i 'm interested to hear the reason that the eu may be against this happening . 
  does n't look like the uk will be breaking any treaties by starting the negotiation . 
  it 'd be ridiculous to expect the uk to sit on its hands when it does n't need to . 
  i imagine the eu might look at rewriting some parts of the treaty after brexit . 
   you spend your time selling brexit to r/europe do i ? 
  you do n't seem to take rejection too well . 
  do you not feel a bit embarrassed saying stuff like this ? 
  we have 15 million children in this country , millions of immigrants who have no say , and millions of people who could n't give a fuck . 
  everyone who was allowed a say had the opportunity to cast their ballot if they wanted to do so , and people voted in larger numbers than ever before . 
  ah i see - thanks . 
  the article is a little bit misleading :  f\u043ell\u043ew\u0456ng theresa may 's 12-point brexit blueprint speech , swiss foreign minister didier burkhalter said : `` we w\u0430nt good , m\u0430\u0443b\u0435 \u0435v\u0435n closer ties w\u0456th britain . 
  but w\u0435 w\u0456ll n\u043et forge \u0430n alliance w\u0456th britain \u0430g\u0430\u0456n\u0455t th\u0435 eu . 
  reject ? 
  i did n't realise anyone was suggesting an alliance ` against the eu ' to begin with . 
  this is absolutely horrific . 
  poor poor woman . 
   far right government we 've found the idiot . 
  looks like crowdpac ( uk/us ) released a fr version recently . 
  can any frenchies tell me how accurate the results are ? 
  apparently i 'm most like ` nicolas dupont-aignan ' , at 70 % conservateur , 52 % lib\u00c9ral - but does n't mean much as i 'm not french !, 
  well , i guessed the approximate value from memory , but it seems i was n't far off at all : https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/statistics-net-migration-statistics/ * net eu migration in 2009 : 58,000 * net eu migration in 2016 : 189,000 so , 3.2 times as many , not 4 . 
  net migration from the eu has almost quadrupled since 2009 , which explains the majority of it . 
  i 've been watching a youtuber called deep digger dan . 
  he 's given up a full year of his life going around the coast of the uk making one or two videos each day , raising money for charity . 
  so far he 's gone down the east coast ( from yorkshire ) , along the south coast and is gradually working his way through the west country . 
  he 's still got ta get all the way up the west coast and around scotland yet . 
  some of the [ sights ] ( https://youtu.be/xihw2ucwjmo?t=408 ) in cornwall are absolutely beautiful - loads of ancient stone circles and settlements dotted around , and a really nice rocky coast . 
  i 'm definitely going to go for a break in cornwall this summer , 
  the ceremony is more religious than here in the uk , and we 've got no separation . 
  really odd to see . 
  spice girls - wannabe, 
  it was planned . 
  we were testing how easy it is to rush to the defence of a group of countries that dislike us . 
  the tasering seems uncalled for and i shall not defend that , but why on earth did n't the guy just help the police ? 
  they 're trying to identify a criminal and think he might be that criminal . 
  he could 've just given his name and everything would 've been good . 
  seems like a pretty weird way for a ` race relations adviser ' to act . 
  the police are trying to keep you safe , so help them do their job . 
  we 're planning for a very hard brexit ... 
  it 's just the guardian doing their usual headline trickery . 
  they 've worded it in a way that lets them claim they 're not calling him far-right , even though they clearly are . 
  i 'm pretty sure this has always been the case for us in the uk . 
  we are a very cynical country . 
  it 's worth pointing out that there 's other eu countries on that list - france and italy are below us . 
  germany is only a couple of percent higher . 
  i think being critical and untrusting of your government is quite a european attitude to have . 
  very low population in wales and cornwall . 
  lots of unemployed sheep . 
  please do n't . 
  we 're discussing free movement of people , not just immigration in general . 
  it 's a no-brainer to have a free movement agreement with these countries , for fairly obvious reasons . 
  you know they wo n't flood the labour market with cheap labour , you know they will instantly integrate so no need to have special integration/language classes and you know they wo n't arrive in huge numbers . 
  do you shout racist at people as you 're walking down the street ? 
   so whatever mike , you 're on a very slippery slope here with your initial statement , and you know it did you * read * my initial statement ? 
  let me paste it , once again , and hopefully you 'll read it this time . 
   i do n't think it 's particularly surprising that people are more welcome to immigration from countries with similar gdp/capita and where the people speak english as their main language . 
  in what way does india fit in to either of those categories ? 
  what the fuck has india got to do with anything ? 
  firstly , we have more indians living in the uk than from any other country . 
  secondly , did you even read what i 'd written ? 
   welcome to immigration from countries with ** similar gdp/capita ** and where the people speak ** english as their main language ** * india gdp/capita $ 1,498 * uk gdp/capita $ 41,787 where exactly does india fit in to what i said ? 
  it 's quite embarrassing watching you try to shoehorn racism into this when the two groups being discussed are predominantly white . 
  i do n't think it 's particularly surprising that people are more welcome to immigration from countries with similar gdp/capita and where the people speak english as their main language . 
  free movement between canzuk would not see millions of people come into the uk . 
  fantastic news . 
  \\* * prepares for downvotes * \\* ** edit : ** that said , i do wish labour would get their shit together . 
  a strong opposition would be better for the country . 
  the tories are beating labour by 16 % amongst the * working class * at the moment . 
  i ca n't see there being any kind of hard border because of the social/political implications . 
  free movement between the two countries is likely to stay . 
  work visas will be issued to eu nationals wanting to work anywhere within the uk . 
  within ni their eligibility to work will be checked by employers , but in the mainland they 'll also have their visa checked at the airport . 
  i think everything possible will be done to avoid provoking the situation . 
  it only took 3 weeks to get here . 
  trade is going to boom !, 
  the idea that someone was arrested for some innocent birthday celebration in a park is a claim that i find very hard to believe . 
  the article seems to purposely obscure the fact that he was * drinking * in the park ( which is illegal ) until the later paragraphs , so forgive me if i stay quite cynical that the events were as innocent as the article leads you to believe without further evidence to back it up . 
  maybe the article is telling the truth , so forgive my cynicism , but the independent is a pro-eu left wing pile of shite which is borderline fake news these days , so would rather wait until there 's information on somewhere like the bbc website . 
   in 2015 , the last full year for which home office data is available , 3,699 eu citizens were detained under immigration powers -- 11.4 per cent of all detainees -- while in 2009 just 768 were detained , 2.7 per cent of the total . 
  right , so either since 2009 the government has secretly been creating a hate campaign to spread fear amongst eu citizens living in the uk ... or the percentage of detainees has increased because the percentage of eu nationals in the eu has massively increased since 2009 .
