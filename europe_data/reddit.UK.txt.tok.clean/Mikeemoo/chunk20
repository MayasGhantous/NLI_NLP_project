  over * a million * eu nationals have moved here since 2009 . 
  i wonder which one it is . 
   do you feel european ? 
  not particularly . 
  i do n't think many in the uk do , especially outside of cities . 
  we tend to talk about europe as being ` over there ' . 
  only 15 % of brits feel ` european ' , and 64 % of people do not feel ` in any way ' european . 
   what is europe ( the continent ) for you ? 
  a collection of interesting and diverse stereotypes attempting uniformity . 
  i 'm happy that our government have made it clear that we * are * willing to walk away . 
  the impact of this was discussed quite a bit in the various select committees . 
  they 're aware of the potential detrimental outcomes of this , and are no doubt already planning how to best reduce the pain if it comes to that . 
  this is why i 'll be one of those disgusting tory voters come 2020 . 
  corbyn would 've bent over a barrel and pulled his trousers down . 
  oh bless you . 
  i know , from looking at your comment history , that you 're tearing yourself apart over this whole brexit thing - but unemployment dropping to the lowest level in 12 years is pretty big news for any country . 
   `` if mr hollande wants to administer punishment beatings to anybody who seeks to escape [ the eu ] , ** in the manner of some world war ii movie ** , i do n't think that is the way forward . 
  oh , maybe i 'm not . 
  source ? 
  * 31.80 m in work , 294,000 up on year * 23.25 m working full-time , 209,000 up on year * 8.55 million working part-time , 86,000 up on year * lowest unemployment since july to september 2005, 
  there 's a difference between `` having a different opinion '' and `` spouting shit '' . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're thick or trolling . 
  you 're talking bollocks . 
  if you asked a random person on the street about our 'em pire ' they probably could n't even tell you when it was or which countries it included . 
  nobody learns about it , nobody gives a fuck about it . 
  theneweuropean is a website ( and newspaper ) set up after the referendum to whine about the result . 
  it 's quite a funny read . 
  i 'm fairly sure it 's satire . 
  based on what evidence ? 
  the uk government said they 'll spend ~ 8 months coming up with their strategy . 
  6 months have passed and they 're starting to reveal some information about how they intend to proceed . 
  where 's the improvisation ? 
  [ a lot , not alot ] ( http://thewritepractice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/alot-vs-a-lot1-600x450.png ), 
  ... as are other countries ... 
  these are forecasts . 
  to avoid me having to type this out again : https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/5obu8t/swedish_minister_shocked_by_xenophobia_towards/dci3uvs/ had an employee in a bank in the city square mile ( where there 's * loads * of foreign workers ) said this , they would 've most likely been sacked on the spot and it would 've made the news when it happened . 
  this story smells of absolute nonsense . 
  * hitler intensifies *, 
  someone told someone they were n't sure what the status of eu nationals will be after we leave the eu . 
  most of the article just discusses people not knowing the status of eu nationals after the uk leaves the eu . 
  shocking . 
  i 'm going to guess that the source is the imf . 
  yeah i agree that aus and nz are likely to be a lot simpler . 
  the us one is . . interesting . 
  although on the face of it trump seems quite protectionist , i think the main issue for them is doing deals with countries that have far cheaper labour and lesser standards , which is n't such a problem with the uk . 
  he 'll also want to make quite a statement when first going into office . 
  that said , i do n't think it 'll be easy at all . 
  i 'm hoping that the inexperience of trumps team will shine through , 
  there have been plenty of examples of bilateral trade deals being negotiated in fairly short time spans - some in as little as a year if i recall correctly . 
  however , doing all of that while simultaneously negotiating arrangements with the eu will be a stretch . 
  the results of the eu negotiations will also have an impact on the ftas , too . 
  from what i 've seen from reading and watching trade negotiators , there 's plenty of preliminary groundwork that two countries can do together before crafting deals , so the next couple of years wo n't be completely wasted time . 
  we export 11 % to the us , and only 0.25 % to nz . 
  i imagine we 'll be putting far more resources into the us deal , but it depends on the political will . 
  it 'd be a mistake for them to spend such a huge amount of money on outdated tech . 
  it 's also a bad idea for the uk . 
  i did n't think either of those were right wing .

  how many times is this news story going to be posted ? 
  this is the 5th post , and it 's not even true . 
  it 's the same thing we do to non-eea people 2 . 
  may has already said they are not going to be doing this . 
   the government is not considering a # 1,000 levy on businesses for hiring skilled workers from the european union after brexit , the pm has insisted . 
  robert goodwill made a throwaway comment about considering the idea . 
  this does not make it a `` government plan '' . 
  i do n't imagine there 'd be costs for the nhs . 
  even if they did have to , you 're talking what . . # 30m or something out of a budget of # 100000m . 
  anyway , irrelevant now . 
  the pm has ruled it out . 
  the independent goes into a bit more detail :  the european union is at greater risk than the uk if the two parties are unable to agree a financial transition phase for the city of london after brexit in 2019 , the governor of the bank of england , mark carney , has warned . 
   giving evidence to the treasury select committee , mr carney stressed again that it would be `` welcome '' and `` highly advisable '' for uk-based financial firms that do business with continental europe to receive transition arrangements so they do not lose access abruptly in two years ' time . 
   but he stressed that if this did not happen the greater financial stability risk lay with european states , rather than the uk . 
   `` i 'm not saying there are not financial stability risks to the uk - and there are economic risks to the uk - but there are greater financial stability risks on the continent in the short term for the transition than there are for the uk , '' he said . 
   the governor stressed the reliance of european households , governments , corporations and banks on the city . 
   `` if you rely on a jurisdiction for half of your lending [ and ] half of your securities transactions you should think very carefully about transition from where you are today to where you will be tomorrow , '' he said . 
  to clarify , this is something that 's already being introduced for non-eea workers . 
  this is not some nasty thing to single out eea workers - once we 're outside of the eu , they 're * considering * applying the policy to all . 
  personally i support our immigration policy applying to all people equally , no matter where they 're from . 
  i * am * calm , but also aware that the government have been very clear that they will not do tat , so it 's a pointless/ridiculous argument for people to keep repeating . 
   why not do that ? 
  `` if the government starts throwing out eu citizens , i do n't want to live in this country any more , '' she says i 'm not sure why people keep saying this . 
  the government have given no indication that they 'll throw people out - quite the opposite , really . 
  these people only hear what they want to hear . 
   at least 20 quite scary-looking people turned up with bandanas over their faces , holding up st george 's flags and filming everything . 
  i do n't know what group they were from but , to me , they looked a bit kind of neo-nazi , white supremacist -- that sort of ilk . 
  they were giving us a lot of grief , telling us we did n't respect democracy . '' they looked a bit nasty and nazi-ish ... holding up those english flags . 
  reminds me of that time i went past a mosque full of brown people and they looked kinda . . isis-ish and nasty .

  yeah good luck with that .

  my car would n't start this morning amidst brexit turmoil . 
  do journalists get bonus pay if they mention brexit in articles ? 
  this does n't really have anything to do with brexit at all , no more than any other political event within europe . 
  too big . 
  sturgeon is such an idiot . 
  who cares if she 's bluffing ? 
  the majority of scots do not wish to leave the uk . 
  have your indyref .
