  does this article even * say * anything ? 
  it seems to be more of just another rant than anything else . 
  they 've quoted the words ` train crash ' , but the apparent source is ` diplomatic and business circles ' . 
  i have received no new information from this article . 
  check out your own submissions history for this subreddit . 
  you dumb fuck . 
  if you think this is ` local news ' , then most of the posts here are local news . 
  i feel that this post has upset you . 
  surely he 'd breeze through it if he 'd live here his whole life ? 
  they were all current news stories discussing different topics . 
  we 've got blackjack and hookers , though . . 
  heaven forbid there might be people with their own views . 
  maybe every country should let the eu institutions do the thinking for them . 
   crimes based on xenophobia increased 2 or 3 fold , right no , * reports * of hate crime did . 
  this is vastly different . 
  this is within the context of a country that , like america , has people on the left that find * everything * offensive - to the point where they 'll actively look for things to be offended by . 
   and as eu member you always acted and wanted to be treated as the special kid on the block you 're mistaking ` wanting to be treated as the special kid ' with ` having a different mindset/attitude to the rest of the eu ' . 
  i hope for a fast and clean exit . 
   some even made cards saying - no more polish vermin you realise this was * one * person in a population of 64.1 million people , yes ? 
  that 's a grand total of 0.000001 % of the population . 
  march 31st, 
  we 've got a few people with experience of trade negotiation , but not many at all . 
  funnily enough , most of our trade negotiators work for the eu . 
  it 'd be interesting to know how many of them have been dragged back to the uk . 
  if we 're leaving the customs union ( which i imagine we are ) , there should be plenty of uk work for them for the foreseeable future . 
  go for it . 
  reddit is a place for discussion of articles . 
  yes , i agree . 
  this is what oppositions are for . 
  nothing to do with ` enemy of the people ' . 
  oh shit , sorry - i did n't realise that you were a political insider too !, 
  mind you , they seem to be doing a pretty good job considering they 're incompetent . 
  what 's finlands excuse ? 
  this is one party attacking another party . 
  this is what politics * is * . 
  but yes , lets pretend this is somehow related to ` enemy of the people ' . 
  what the fuck are you even on about ? 
  the key line is at the bottom of the article  william wallace is a liberal democrat peer `` insider '' , aka member of the pro-eu party . 
  aka boris the bullet dodger, 
  what are we jealous of ? 
  scumbags . 
  an embarrassment for our country . 
  economist from pro-eu group dismisses claims by economist from pro-brexit group . 
  this map is meaningless and inverted . 
  our invading days are over . 
  we 're in retirement . 
  the new plan is to bathe in the sun and then harvest old people for their leathery skin , which 'll become our new main export . 
  not for much longer . 
  operation wind turbine will be enabled soon . 
  we 're heading to warmer climates . 
  ... we 've found the idiot . 
  how about look at the results of the poll instead of some ** weird ** attack ** on ** the owner of the media outlet . 
  i thought you were banned from this subreddit , anyway . 
  new account ? 
  ah good point . 
  although , looking at [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate ) , their ` per billion vehicle-km ' looks pretty average for europe . 
  still seems like a pretty big amount of deaths ? 
  considering the population is only 8.4 million . 
  looks like an army of women in burqas . 
  things will happen . 
  some people will think that some of the things are good , some people will think that some of the things are bad . 
  you already had this thread removed for editorializing the title , then you post it again with a new editorialized title . . 
   do brits really think germany and germans want to ` conquer ' europe instead of having peace and prosperity for everyone and being serious about human rights ? 
  not particularly . 
  some more fringe people like [ peter hitchens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cnedtzmpju ) have suggested it , but it 's not really the general view . 
  some people do feel that germany dominates the eu , but that 's just due to size/economy and not the fault of germany . 
  no they would n't . 
  almost every single poll done since the referendum has shown we would still leave . 
  can we please stop pushing this bullshit ` news ' ? 
  it 's dumb that people trust polling companies that attempt to do the whole of europe . 
  do we really think their knowledge of the demographics is better than companies that actually focus on that particular country ? 
  ca n't be great at everything ... 
  and downloading counter-strike cheats, 
  what makes you think anyone is trying to delay it ? 
  the government gave a date not long after the referendum and they still think they 're on course to hit the date . 
  are you just ... talking shit ? 
   she does her job , she does it well , with little fanfare . 
  this is a meaningless statement . 
  * what * exactly has she done well ? 
  i 'm interested to know what you think is good about her . 
  fuck no . 
  that 's because you 're better . 
  getting 18 % of our electricity from wind today because of the storm . 
   around 40 % of northern ireland 's electorate vote for nationalist political parties ... 
  irrelevant . 
  i know people that vote for snp because they think snp are best for scotland , not because they want independence . 
   ( a figure that has increased steadily over the years ) [ increased steadily ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/northern_ireland_life_and_times_survey_constitutional_preference.png ) ? 
   also , with the year we 've just had , you probably should n't be placing as much faith as you are in polls . 
  if you 're referring to the brexit polling , they were accurate . 
  the majority of polls actually had leave winning , and pretty much every poll out there was within the margin of error . 
  show me a poll where there is n't a vast majority against reunification . 
  about 20 % of the people in ni wish to unify with ireland . 
  it has barely changed in the past 20 years ( if anything it 's reduced slightly ) . 
  that 's the most important bit of information you need to know . 
  aye , drawing these country borders is such a waste of ink , too !, 
  you admit elsewhere in this thread that you have n't a fucking clue what you 're talking about , yet continue to state your opinions on the matter . 
  yeah man , lets all upvote this guy . 
  northern ireland should join ireland even though the vast majority people living there do n't want that to happen . 
  fuck what they want !, 
  no , they made a single time line clear .
