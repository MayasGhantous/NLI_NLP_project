  show me an instance of government position being anything other than end of march . 
  the polls for the referendum were within the margin of error . 
  some of the polls were showing leave winning on the 23rd . 
   while it is mostly the case , there have been a few polls done after the referendum with evidence of a significant swing towards remain you 'll need to provide evidence of that . 
  the vast majority of polls since the referendum have shown that people stick by their decision . 
  there 's only been a couple ( out of many ) that show remain in the lead , and that 's only a very slight lead . 
  here 's a list of the official ( british polling council ) polls up until october : * [ 24rd june - eu referendum ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results ) - ** 51.9 % leave ** , 48.1 % remain * [ 29th - 30th june ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/assets/docs/polls/newsnight-post-referendum-poll-tables-2016.pdf ) : 43 % leave , ** 44 % remain ** * [ 3rd - 4th july ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/lipxi83rmo/eurotrack_gb_full_website.pdf ) 45 % leave , 45 % remain * [ 21st - 22nd july ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/lipxi83rmo/eurotrack_gb_full_website.pdf ) ** 44 % leave ** , 43 % remain * [ 1st - 2nd august ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/dwpdjgfxsp/timesresults_160802_trackers&amp;vi_w.pdf ) ** 46 % leave ** , 42 % remain * [ 8th - 9th august ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/5yng128b6c/timesresults_160809_vi_trackers_website.pdf ) ** 45 % leave ** , 44 % remain * [ 16th - 17th august ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ocn4lf00me/timesresults_160823_vi_trackers_w.pdf ) ** 46 % leave ** , 43 % remain * [ 22nd - 23rd august ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ocn4lf00me/timesresults_160823_vi_trackers_w.pdf ) ** 45 % leave ** , 43 % remain * [ 30th - 31st august ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/jb4y2me4q0/timesresults_160831_vi_trackers_w.pdf ) ** 47 % leave ** , 44 % remain * [ 13th - 14th september ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/36cem5h375/timesresults_160914_vi_trackers_w.pdf ) ** 46 % leave ** , 43 % remain * [ 11th - 12th october ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/vohvzlss3c/timesresults_161012_vi_trackers_w.pdf ) ** 45 % leave ** , 43 % remain * [ 11th - 12th october ] ( http://www.bmgresearch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/confidential-bmg-poll-october-data-tables-031116.pdf ) 43 % leave , ** 45 % remain ** i have n't bothered monitoring them since october , but from what i 've seen it 's pretty much exactly the same pattern . 
  mostly leave with the occasional remain . 
  leave the eu to keep the swedes out ? 
  what ? 
  pretty sure mine would just be pure head . 
  blimey , i 'm surprised huffpo ran with this story . 
  less than two minutes in and he 's already talking shit . 
  the ecj would never have to rule on whether or not the referendum was a ` valid referendum ' . 
  the power of the referendum itself has never been in question as it was not legally binding . 
  what * is * in question is whether or not royal prerogative can be used , especially with the * consideration * that parliament voted to defer the decision to the public in the form of a referendum . 
  except ... 
  i 'm pretty sure he did n't . 
  he said he did n't know if it could be . 
  i watched the entire [ committee meeting ] ( http://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/bfb4a78d-cc92-40c3-a0c4-5d8ad6162af8 ) and he did not ` indicate eu exit could be stopped ' . 
  interestingly what * is * discussed in the select committee is the amount of news websites saying he 's said things he 's never said . 
  all he said regarding article 50 was `` it may not be revocable -- i do n't know . '' . 
  this is very different to the headline of this article . 
  the government has no intention of revoking it . 
   we need to discuss the anglo question did you actually watch the clip ? 
  it 's not at all about ` anglos ' . 
  it 's entirely about continental europeans . 
  nope . 
  corp tax makes up only ~ 8 % of all tax revenue . 
  surprisingly positive, 
  why does shit like this get upvoted ? 
  not much to say because they all have different views . 
  niall ferguson is worth watching , though . 
  he campaigned to remain with david cameron but now thinks it was the wrong thing to do . 
  thought you guys might like this . 
  what has the independent have to do with this ? 
  they 're just reporting the poll from one of the most trusted polling companies . 
  itt : people responding to the title and not the content, 
  so many ` coulds ' . 
  brexit voters were mostly all happy to keep all europeans currently living here . 
  people just want the ridiculous amount of immigration reduced . 
  news.sky.com is not a credible source now ? 
  t'was sarcasm . 
  / r/europe thinks everyone in the uk is racist , yet the reality is that most of them live in * far * less tolerant countries . 
  racist uk at it again . 
  low, 
  so , when 's the re-referendum happening ? 
  is this the part where he finds out he actually won the referendum ? 
  he 's taking a long time to say it !, 
  mostly just a domestic change ( well , lack of domestic change ) . 
  however , likely that renzi will resign in the speech he 's giving right now , which * potentially * has wider consequences . 
  eur is being a bit odd right now - it shot up a few minutes ago and now it 's bouncing around . 
  i wonder if some people had some early information about what he 's about to say in his speech . 
  it 's verhofstadt . 
  his solution to everything is * more * europe . 
  the reason people voted for brexit is because they wanted more europe . 
  they just did n't know it . 
  if renzi resigns , as expected , there might be a new election , and then five star movement people have a shot . 
  they 're quite eurosceptic . 
  brexit was n't necessarily a left/right vote . 
  nor was this italian referendum . 
  as for america . . trump is pretty left for a republican . 
  exit poll https://twitter.com/ncpoliticseu/status/805532347022065664  yes 43  no 57, 
  you keep quoting that , but again - i 'm looking for evidence of the leave campaign * actually * citing that , which you have yet to provide . 
  and again , there 's a difference between having a tariff-free deal and being a member of the eea like norway . 
  norway is a member of the eea . 
  nobody within the leave campaign suggested that we should remain members of the eea . 
  again , that video was completely debunked on national tv : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dkcjfevts every clip within that video was cut up and taken completely out of context . 
  your first link is from october 2015 , long before the referendum campaigns started , and it 's not even a leave campaigner saying it - it 's an article saying that cameron will challenge the idea of a norway deal . 
  your second link has nothing to do with norway at all . 
   they recently did a whole youtube video full of brexit leaders like daniel hannan saying ` nobody is suggesting we leave the single market ' . 
  for you to say the brexit side was clearly saying the opposite with any consistency is not credibile . 
  this was utterly debunked on national tv - every quote they used in that clip was taken out of context . 
  here 's the full debunk from andrew neil on sunday politics : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dkcjfevts, 
  show me evidence of any leave campaigners stating that we would have `` norway + immigration control '' , or even that we 'd not leave the single market . 
  let me quote you again . .  not the leave side , lol . 
  they said '' oh we 're gon na get the norway option + control movement of people '' . 
  interesting how quick the revisionism begins . 
  you appear to be trying to avoid answering this . 
  those are the main leave and remain campaigners being very clear on national tv . 
  if i 'm cherry picking , show me where they claimed we would not leave the single market . 
  you 've made a claim yet you 're completely unable to back it up with any evidence at all . 
  you 're talking absolute nonsense . 
  both sides said very clearly that we 'd be leaving the single market . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aui5a1gd5d0 `` revisionism '' indeed . 
  i look forward to seeing your evidence of them all saying `` norway + immigration control '' . 
  ** edit : ** love that i 'm getting downvoted for this . 
  the good old / r/europe circlejerk - downvote anyone who breaks your insular bubble . 
  yet , you 've upvoted to +13 someone who is clearly lying and ca n't provide a shred of evidence to back up his claim . 
  yes , it did . 
  time and time again people on all sides of the argument said very clearly that it meant leaving the single market , leaving the customs union and taking back control over immigration . 
  this `` there was n't clarity '' thing is just the libdems & labour desperately trying to subvert the result of the referendum . 
  did anyone know the exact outcome of what 'd happen when we leave ? 
  no , of course not - but that 's because it 's a negotiation . 
  nobody knows the outcome of the negotiation before the negotiation has started . 
  not sure what he wants to do , exactly . 
  however , if `` no '' wins , i think he has said he 'll resign , so there 's a chance an election will be called , which 'll potentially have big consequences . 
  are they ? 
  how so ? 
  by increasing the minimum wage again ?
