  we 've left the eu and re-branded ourselves . 
  less than # 55 billion is linked to brexit , according to bbc . 
  it 's also worth mentioning that this is based forecasts that many people consider to be fairly pessimistic , based on what the growth levels we 've seen at the back end of 2016 . 
  we have them every year . 
  german ones , i mean . 
  although up here in leeds we do n't have the big german beer tent this year , we 've got a `` viking-themed bar in a ` tipi ' tent '' instead . 
  vikings  germans, 
  if you do n't have enough money to get there , how are you going to survive once you 're there ? 
  this wo n't be of interest to a lot of you , but i know that some of you seem to be completely obsessed with brexit for whatever reason . 
  this is far more informative than the nonsense headlines and hot air that we see every other day . 
  the three witnesses are : * dr robin niblett , director , chatham house * stephen booth , acting director and director of policy and research , open europe * shankar singham , director of economic policy and prosperity studies , the legatum institute it 's a long committee , but goes into quite a lot of depth around certain subjects . 
  the consensus from the witnesses seem to be that we should leave the single market and customs union , and look to form a sector-based free trade agreement , with the possibility of a 3-4 year transitional agreement . 
  some of the cards the uk is able to negotiate with is things like security and some level of movement of workers . 
  there 's also the option to offer additional support ( such as help towards infrastructure development ) to certain countries within the eu . 
  there 's also a lot of discussions about services.etc . 
  there 's a whole lot more than i can summarise though , so worth a watch if you 're interested and have a couple of hours spare . 
  they would n't because the polls show the majority do n't want it . 
  they 'll keep a gun held to the governments head until the polls swing in their favour . 
  personally , i 'd love for the government to force a scottish referendum now . 
  oh france , cheer up guys . 
  your country is awesome . 
  duplicate , needs content ? 
  we get maps posted here all the time . 
  has this one been posted before ? 
  those fucking racist intolerant brits at it again . 
  only 1360 , yes . 
  that 's a tiny amount - it 's 0.136 % of the children born each year deemed to be at risk of significant harm from their natural parents . 
  should parents be able to keep their children even if there 's a significant risk of them harming them ? 
  i see nothing wrong with this . 
  riiiight . 
  so , the claim is that 1,000 are wrongly adopted . 
  but only 3,040 children are adopted each year , and only 1,360 of those are ` against the parents will ' - so the claim is that 73 % of adoptions against the parents will are ` wrong ' . 
  you can instantly see this is utter bollocks . 
  of the 1,000,000 or so children born each year , having 1,360 children put up for adoption because the parents are deemed unfit to bring up the child safely does not sound even remotely abnormal . 
  i 'm surprised it 's so low . 
  this is a case of the press reading far too deeply into a comment the pm made . 
  all she said was that businesses ` do n't like being on a cliff edge ' . 
  that 's literally all she said . 
  from that , the press has declared that maybe she means there 's a transitional deal , ( the government denied that she was hinting at that ) , and now the press are making the claim that this 'll piss off tory mps . 
  they may well look for a transitional deal , but i would suggest that the press should n't read so much into a single line comment that the government has already debunked . 
  maybe the way she was standing indicated something ? 
  or the way she walked onto stage ... 
  they did n't get brexit absolutely wrong . 
  the results were well within the margin of error . 
  `` pizzaburger '' . 
  i 'm glad we 're not being associated with such a thing . 
  good find !, 
  so you 're conceding that the date has not changed ? 
  ever since may became pm , the date of triggering has been set to the end of march 2017 . 
  * this has not changed . 
  * some people are referring to `` negotiations starting in april '' , because that 's when they 'll likely start . 
  but yes , lets pretend that the date keeps moving . 
  uk polls did well in the referendum . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-brexit-watch/ in the final few days it was neck and neck . 
  the result was within the margin of error . 
  lol what ? 
  i see * so much * shitposting towards the uk on here and people are never warned . 
  good . 
  corp tax is fucking painful to small businesses like mine . 
  oh come on , are we still having this ridiculous conversation ? 
  http://survation.com/archive/2016-2/ ctrl-f `` on behalf of '' - 42 matches ( i.e. 
  almost every single poll ) http://www.bmgresearch.co.uk/category/polling/page/2/  evening standard , independent . . etc. 
  http://www.comresglobal.com/our-work/poll-archive/  save the children , sunday mirror . . etc. 
  they are generally published in both places . 
  https://yougov.co.uk/publicopinion/archive/  yougov / the times voting intention, 
  google for ` poll `` on behalf of '' ' . 
  lots of polling companies do lots of polls for lots of companies . 
  one of the regular ones is the yougov poll done for the times newspaper , but there 's plenty of one-off polls for large and small companies , political campaigns , newspapers , charities and individuals . 
  most polling companies release the data themselves when they poll for another company . 
  if this was a poll by any of the bpc members it 'd be all over the news , not just some little article on the ft. 
  even if it * was * done by a bpc member , it 's very different to every single poll that has been done since the referendum ( including the [ yougov poll ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/j91v52gjon/ygarchive-171116-votingintention.pdf ) done last week ) and therefore would clearly be an outlier . 
  a british polling company that is a member of the british polling council is far more likely to understand the demographics of britain , and how to weight them , than a company trying to poll the whole of the eu . 
  the polls were pretty good for the referendum . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-brexit-watch/ in the final days it was extremely close , and the result was within the margin of error . 
  in the week leading up to the vote they were bang on . 
  i can instantly see the poll is bullshit . 
  they 've put the uk at what ... 58 % pro-eu ? 
  the actual polls still have it at 48 % or less , and it has n't really moved in 4 months . 
  am i expected to trust a europe-wide poll over regular nationwide poll from various british polling council members ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  if they can get the uk poll wrong by 10 % , how wrong are the polls for the other countries ? 
  ** edit : ** why the downvotes ? 
  what do you disagree with ? 
  * i 'm hoping the eu will finally be able to change itself - either by further integration ( good for us ) or by breaking up . 
  i do n't feel the current state is something that can be maintained , and the uk would always have been the ` problem child ' , unwilling to let things happen . 
  * being a single state , we 'll be able to form new trading relationships around the world a lot easier than waiting for the eu to do it . 
  there 's plenty of countries showing interest in it already - especially the us - which is 10 % of our export market . 
  * globalisation has hollowed out the centre ground across the west . 
  people are either leaning further left or further right . 
  this is a dangerous situation , and it 's something that is much harder to deal with from within the eu . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkm2vfj42fy ) video ( ` trumpism ' ) is worth a watch if you get bored . 
  lots more , but 3am - sleep time . 
  for a long time we 've had 4 or 5 users posting anti-uk or `` the uk is doomed '' articles en masse to / r/europe , so some folk have been posting all good news articles here to counteract it . 
  things have been exaggerated on both sides . 
   i 've yet to see anything good coming from brexit . 
  care to fill me in ? 
  we have n't even triggered article 50 yet , let alone gone through negotiations , let alone gone through the economic recovery . 
  i do n't think anyone expected anything good to come from the referendum for a long time yet . 
  every country `` might be ok '' in the long term .
