  `` exploiting his experience '' seems a bit of a harsh way of putting it . 
   `` the president-elect is above all an outsider and unknown quantity , whose campaign pronouncements may reveal his instincts , but will surely evolve and , particularly , be open to outside influence if pitched right . 
   having , we believe , built better relationships with his team than have the rest of washington diplomatic corps , we should be well placed to do this '' putting yourself in a position where you can help influence someones views is what every country does to every country . 
  it 's politics . 
  what are you even trying to suggest here ? 
  ... what ? 
  it has always been the position of brexiteers to allow eu nationals to stay . 
  even the hardline brexiteers want it . 
  that 's `` in work '' . 
  there 's over 3m eu nationals here . 
  holy shit , the nonsense conspiracy bullshit in this thread is ridiculous . 
  there 's cctv of when the police shot the three terrorists . 
  you people are embarrassing . 
  we do n't wear footwear in europe . 
  by wikileaks ? 
  your comment makes little sense . 
  the article he linked to refers to an open britain video where clips were cut up out of context to apparently show various people saying we would not leave the single market . 
  the video i linked to debunks that video . 
  i have also linked another video where many people were making it perfectly clear that leaving the eu means leaving the single market . 
  which part are you not getting ? 
  is anyone going to show me clips of various campaigners saying that we * wo n't * leave the single market ? 
  videos that have n't been proven to be clipped out of context , that is . 
  you literally have n't watched the video where andrew neil debunks their video , have you ? 
  every clip was clipped out of context . 
  try watching the video . 
  let me link it a few more times for you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dkcjfevts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dkcjfevts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dkcjfevts a couple more : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dkcjfevts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dkcjfevts hth . 
  no need to be offensive . 
  there 's two videos . 
  as you can see , your claim that `` several prominent official vote leave spokespeople specifically said that we would not leave the single market . '', 
  has been debunked . 
  righto . 
  are you british ? 
  did you watch any of the coverage ? 
  it was * very * clear . 
  here you go : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fdn0mvchq4 if you need help , i can list exactly who those people are . 
  what you 're referring to is a spin video by open britain , which was thoroughly debunked on the bbc : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dkcjfevts do keep up . 
   your incessant bullshit every time this comes up is a fucking joke . 
  i love seeing people angry when anyone reading this can see that they 're objectively wrong . 
  it was * very * clear that it meant leaving the single market . 
  every major political figure said it on national tv and during campaigns , on both sides of the argument . 
  there is only one type of brexit . 
  `` hard '' and `` soft '' are stupid terms . 
  brexit means leaving the eu and associated institutions . 
  context : bbc newsnight is week-daily programme here in the uk . 
  this clip is from last night . 
  did you actually watch the clip of amber rudd ? 
  she does not say what the independent claims she said . 
  she says she does n't know if they 're true , and says they 're in conflict with other discussions that are happening . 
  in the full clip ( which the independent cut out ) she says she 's not surprised that there 's leaks like this coming out , she does not say she is surprised at the apparent conversations mentioned within the leak . 
  trying to use the independent as a source for any kind of argument is a huge mistake . 
  you 'd not considered that the ` leak ' was designed to try to rattle the uk government ? 
  not only is it the start of negotiations , it 's also during an election campaign . 
  expect a lot more of this stuff in the next couple of years from both sides . 
  divide and conquer . 
  so . . the same or better q1 growth as 2016 and 2015 . . 
   i think it is weird that people are changing their mind now they 're not . 
  this is one poll of many , and every other question in the poll was out of whack too . 
  this poll is an outlier . 
  there has been weekly polls for the past year and this is the only poll that has shown any majority for ` remain ' . 
  this same poll is an outlier on every other metric measured recently ( popularity rating , party voting intention.etc . ) . 
  sorry remainers , i know you 've been waiting a year to see a poll like this , but if next weeks is the same , i 'll eat my hat . 
  [ removed ], 
  [ removed ], 
  [ removed ], 
  i think this is a great article . 
  it sums things up very well . 
  i agreed with you mostly , but disagreed with your conclusion . 
  you realise that the posters are just someone joking around , right ? 
  considering the wording ( `` ze germans '' ) it 's most likely it 's someone taking the piss out of the leave campaign , trying to imply that they 're xenophobic . 
  na , i think there should be an elected body of some kind as a safety check to stop the government from being overly dickish . 
  i support the idea of something similar to the house of lords , just . . not the house of lords . 
  and the british government !, 
  house of lords can fuck off though . 
  yeah , good luck with that . 
  it might do some good . 
   it 's funny , the amount of brits who complain about immigrants not speaking proper english where i live is pretty high . 
  yet nobody questions the expats in spain who make no effort to learn spanish or even interact with the locals . 
  they just stay in their own , british community . 
  i 'm fairly sure that most brits think that other brits should make an effort in the local community if they live elsewhere , but it 's not really our problem to deal with . 
  war has never been so cute ... 
  transylvania is already in the eu ... 
  uh , `` all major businesses relocating '' * has * been used as an argument in some of the debates by the remain campaign . 
   `` remain '' far ahead what ? 
  there 's very little in it , and it keeps swinging either way . 
  the last poll shows it 's neck and neck . 
  this is for any of you europeans that are following the shitstorm of the eu referendum in the british media . 
  this is by far the most balance & civilised debate i 've seen on it so far . 
  they have a fact-checker on stage and they 're not slinging shit at each other . 
  i think france has bigger worries at the moment . . 
  i did n't get far into the video , but appreciate the amount of effort gone into it !, 
  interesting stuff . 
  i 'm not sure exactly what ` white british ' is when they 're doing the stats . 
  it might just be ` what you identify as ', 
  if any europeans are watching this documentary and are a bit confused : the east end of london has historically been a mostly-white working class area . 
  it has a very distinct heritage , it 's where a lot of our slang developed ( see : [ cockney rhyming slang ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhyming_slang ) ) , and it 's a pretty big part of our british culture ( [ lots of films , tv programmes , music . . etc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_end_of_london_in_popular_culture ) . . ) . 
  [ lock , stock and two smoking barrels ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120735/ ) , [ snatch ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208092/ ) , [ legend ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3569230/ ) , [ made in dagenham ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371155/ ) , loads loads more , plus loads of older films . 
  i have a huge soft spot for that area !, 
  i grew up there . 
  over the past 40 ( or more ? ), 
  years there 's been quite a huge change in the demographics because it became a hot-spot for immigrants wanting to live in the cheapest place they can near to london .
