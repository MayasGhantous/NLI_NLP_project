  i do n't think he 's been seriously mentioned . 
  spectator.co.uk had a throwaway comment about maybe he could take up the job , and some media outlets decided to run with it ( as they do ) . 
  i think many of us just want a decent balance . 
  he 's saying `` listen , chump , if this is n't the english attacking foreigners or a terrorist attack , we do n't want to know '' . 
  most likely had to be mod-approved first . 
  regarding that second video , i 'm glad to see that the piece of shit has been arrested . 
  i 'm interested to know what exactly was going on , though . 
  the police did not arrest him for a hate crime ( which they throw around like it 's going out of fashion ) , and the person just happened to be filming the couple before the man even approached them ? 
  just seems like an odd situation , i 'd be interested in finding out more information if anyone has any further links . 
  hahaha , right - so scotland only decided they liked europeans , and decided to stop committing hate crimes against them , * after * the referendum ? 
  good catch . 
  did n't even notice that . 
  you 're a redditor for 20 hours . 
  / u/source-direct was banned 24 hours ago . 
  your second post links to the post history of source-direct . 
  just a happy coincidence , eh ? 
  are you just doing to keep linking articles or are you going to provide the statistics that you mentioned ? 
  england has a population of 53 million people . 
  scotland has a population of 5 million . 
  i do n't think it 'll be surprising if you can find more articles about england . 
  ah yes , polls are just a tory conspiracy . 
  i look forward to you linking the ` crime statistics ' you mention . 
  it 's very interesting that scots are doing the `` holier than thou '' thing because england wants to reduce immigration , when scottish attitudes towards immigration have been shown to be exactly the same , even though scotland receives proportionately less immigration than england . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-31800374 it 's almost like scottish nationalists will jump on any bandwagon they can to promote the idea that england is bad and they want to get away from it . 
   * xenophobia * ( noun )  * dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries * do you not realise the hypocrisy you 're displaying here ? 
  britain * could * join an alliance with north korea and attempt to invade france . 
  however , it 's rather unlikely . 
  who knows . 
  maybe one of the downvoters can reply to one of our posts to give their reasoning instead of just silently downvoting . 
  / u/trolls _ brigade , / u/source-direct , / u/currency _ cat and / u/new-atlantis have been doing it for months and months . 
  it seems as though most people are bored of their constant propaganda , though . 
  ** edit : ** just looking at source-direct 's [ post history ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/source-direct ) . 
  looks like he was finally banned yesterday . 
  about bloody time too . 
  the fact that he only received a 72 hours ban for [ this shit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/source-direct ) is pretty silly , though . 
  extreme xenophobia , calling moderators cunts . . etc. 
   nissan motor co. 's decision to keep investing in britain came after the carmaker told the government it ** might ** shut down manufacturing in the country after brexit , according to a person familiar with the private discussions . 
  bloomberg and their endless list of anonymous sources . 
  nissan were publicly threatening to move their plant . 
  i 'm pretty sure they 've done the same in the past , too . 
  have you had to resort to satire sites now ? 
  i must 've missed the bit where london became it 's own country . 
  do yorkshire and cornwall get their own seat too ? 
  except ireland ? 
  ... and every other country ... https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/59plnp/lets_talk_about_those_prices/ damn , brexit must be having a worldwide effect . 
  fuck off tony . 
  well then , lets call the whole thing off . 
  does that mean you 'll float away with us ? 
  we * promise * not to be dicks this time, 
  join us , ireland . 
  lets float into the atlantic together , hand in hand . 
  lets go somewhere warmer . 
  he quite clearly says '' ** there 's no offer of exchange ** , there 's just a commitment from the government to work with the whole of the automotive industry to make sure the whole automotive industry in the uk remains competitive '', 
   it is being reported from various sources yes , yet all of those ` sources ' appear to come from the original reuters article , which gives no information . 
  i imagine that if you 've got more sources than just reuters you 're able to give me a single name , right ? 
   and it is well known the nissan ceo had a private chat with may not long ago . 
  yes , as the nissan ceo has said himself . 
  -- i 'm not saying that i know for sure that nissan 's senior vice president is telling the truth , but to believe a source cited as `` someone familiar with the situation '' over the vice president is surely a flawed position to take . 
  right , so it 's the word of `` a separate person familiar with the situation '' verses `` nissan 's senior vice president '' . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37790770  nissan : there is no special deal for us, 
  no , not at all . 
  how have you managed to survive ?!? 
   lawyer carmen prem , who has lived in the capital for 13 years , offered the advice for an article in german newspaper die welt . 
  hahah for fucks sake . 
  anyone who has been to london knows that the majority of time if you overhear someone speaking they 're not speaking english . 
  the idea that people should refrain from speaking their native languages in london is absolutely laughable . 
  if you stop to ask someone for directions it 's always work checking if they speak english first . 
  source : lived and worked in central london . 
  but then what will they be outraged about ? 
  it 's bullshit . 
  women in the uk get paid less than men because they work part time more than men . 
  comparing people who work part time to those who work full time is ridiculous . 
  https://fullfact.org/economy/pay-gap-do-women-earn-80p-every-1-earned-men/  what this tells us is that if we arranged men and women by their hourly pay , and then compared the middle man with the middle woman , we 'd find the woman gets 19.1 % less per hour . 
   because this does n't take any account of how many hours they work , or how much overtime pay they get , it 's not the case that the total take home pay of the median woman would be 81 % of that of the median man  ...  the pay gap is 2.3 % for full-time workers under the age of 40 , which mr cameron described as almost zero . 
  the pay gaps for 22-29 and 30-39 year olds are both negative . 
  the median female wage in these age groups is higher than the median male wage . 
  many women in the uk drop their full time careers and go into part time once they have children , because they can afford to live off a single wage . 
  i constantly hear that there 's a 20 % wage gap in the uk . 
  the truth is that there 's really around a 2 % wage gap - https://fullfact.org/economy/pay-gap-do-women-earn-80p-every-1-earned-men/ women work part time more than men , which counts for the majority of the gap . 
  it 's unsurprising that women work part time more . 
  interestingly , part time women workers actually earn more than part time male workers . 
  i thought these were the same people that did n't believe in genders ... , 
  i 'd vote for farage just for the lols . 
   only three of 50 economists surveyed by bloomberg correctly predicted the number , with everyone else forecasting a weaker reading, 
  racist brits have sent fighter jets to bomb romanians ? 
  confused about this report , but maybe that 's because i ca n't be bothered to read the entire thing . . we have more female than male enrolment in secondary education and tertiary education , but apparently that gives a good score ? 
  is this purely focused on a gap where women are the weaker ? 
  ah yes , `` the new european '' . 
  the newspaper set up specifically to capitalise on the tears of upset remainers . 
  lovely . 
  b. . . b. . . but what about my outrage ? 
  worth saying - although the word quisling comes from vidkun quisling , using it does n't mean you 're actually comparing someone to him . 
  it has been consumed into the language - it 's just a word that essentially means traitor . 
  he should n't use such language in front of a european audience , though . 
  stupid misleading title . 
  he clearly was saying that there 's no european union for the uk after brexit . 
  ukpolitics has been shown time and time again to be almost exactly the same political make-up as the country as a whole . 
  not used to being outside of your bubble and having to hear other views , eh ? 
  ** edit : ** dunno why you 're downvoting - every poll done on ukpolitics consistently shows a very even split between left and right , leave and remain . 
  `` small fraction '' .
