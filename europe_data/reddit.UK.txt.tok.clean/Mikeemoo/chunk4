  i paid 40 % in tax last year , plus about 5 % national insurance contributions . 
  the main poll question , if anyone 's interested : ** if there was another referendum on the uk 's membership of the eu , which of the following is closest to your view ? 
  ** * i would vote to leave : 44.3 % * i would vote to remain : 43.6 % * i would be undecided : 6.6 % * i would not vote : 4.7 % * prefer not to say : 0.7 % so , 50.3 % leave , 49.6 % remain . 
  not much change there . 
  * a majority of uk adults feel the need for britain to govern itself outweighs the economic risks of brexit with 56 % holding this opinion in comparison to the 44 % who take the opposite view . 
  * more people approve of theresa may 's performance regarding the ongoing negotiations over brexit than disapprove ( 58 % total approve figure compared to 25 % total disapprove figure ) * 27 % of uk adults would like there to be an early general election if the government 's brexit plans are to be carried out before 2020 . 
  this compares to 33 % who would not like there to be an early general election in this instance and 32 % who do n't mind either way .

  sweet . 
  although it 's a shame we 've slipped in the world rankings . 
  i usually give around 1 % of my take-home salary each year , but have friends who give a lot more . 
  i 'm not sure why this is news . 
  she campaigned to stay in the eu . 
  she 's said all of this stuff before . 
  no need for talk like that yanis . 
  criticise policies , do n't make personal attacks . 
  people on / r/europe tend to love the guardian , so long as the ridiculous bullshit spin is n't aimed at their own country . 
  the guardian is just a fancy looking tabloid rag and should be given about the same notice as the dailymail . 
  as the left in the uk gets more and more ridiculous , it 's pushing people over to the right . 
  [ teenage tube alert suspect damon smith ` in love with is ' ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/teenage-tube-alert-suspect-damon-smith-in-love-with-is-10630514 ), 
  please supply a source that shows that scottish people did n't want a referendum on eu membership . 
  considering almost 40 % of scots voted to leave , i find it unlikely that under 50 % did n't want a referendum . 
  we voted as a whole . 
  aside from microsofts announcement today - which tech products ? 
  as for `` everything '' , i have n't really noticed anything being more expensive . 
  so uh , whats with all this new kind of spam ? 
  i 've seen it happening across many subreddits recently . 
  anyone know if reddit are planning to do something about it ? 
  it 's been interesting watching the live coverage of it today - many of them when interviewed have said they plan to go to paris . 
  this is apparently `` breaking news '' , so i 'm guessing that means they 're not standing down from their position . 
  living walking distance from the office saves a fortune on commuting costs , 
  i 'm a programmer , i own my own business . 
  i live up in leeds/bradford right now , but have lived in essex , central london , devon and a few other places . 
   yorkshire is great because you can comfortably live somewhere rural while being commutable to a city centre . 
  the guardian do a great job of writing nonsense without actually saying anything . 
  they 're just using the opportunity to link concepts together to create a narrative . 
  many words with no direction , the article does n't really say anything . 
  at least she managed to sprinkle a bit of feminism in there too to remind us that it 's because lily is a female and totally not just because lily is an idiot . 
  the many people were just pissed off that she claimed to speak on behalf of the country while saying something that they do n't agree with , that 's all . 
  it 's about europe . 
  what a ridiculous article . 
  `` brexit fanatic '' - but what they really mean is `` brexit-supporting '' - which you could apply to over half the country . 
  if it was a remainer would they call them a `` remain fanatic '' ? 
  i live in the suburbs , but i prefer countryside . 
  i plan to move to the [ yorkshire dales ] ( http://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/ ) within the next few years . 
  i 'm not sure that i understand the second part of your question . 
  welcome to the uk \\ o /, 
  depressing, 
  i 'm off to see this in about an hour . 
  i shall return with a one word review . 
  it 's still unclear , actually . 
  kebab pizza , 
  plus gchq know what pizza i 'm currently eating . 
  10/10 police work . 
  would recommend . 
  the guy sounds pretty ... fanatical and obsessive . 
  glad he 's found somewhere he likes , though . 
  the idea that the usa does n't have a strong national identity seems to be a bit bizarre . 
  all these comments about `` it 's a regional thing '' are frankly rather bullshit - just typical middle class students who 've never visited a working class area in their lives or lived outside their little bubble . 
  i 've lived all over the country , in both middle class and working class areas . 
  i 've very rarely met anyone with xenophobic or racist views . 
  do they exist ? 
  yeah of course , but it 's a minuscule percentage . 
  i think a big part of the problem is our ` extreme ' media . 
  it 's very well known that most of the british media are pretty atrocious . 
  they will spin , inflate and manipulate absolutely anything if it creates an interesting headline that 'll appeal to the politics of their reader base . 
  being in english language means the most of the world can read it . 
  i hope ( and i trust ) that you 'll continue to feel no discrimination in this country . 
  ** edit : ** i 'll share a little story about what happened to me last tuesday in one of these awful racist northern towns that are mentioned in this thread . 
  i went out for some food with friends to a colombian restaurant . 
  the black waiter gave the wrong person the wrong drink then laughed and said `` all you whiteys look the same '' . 
  everyone laughed , someone shouted back `` brexit means brexit ! '' . 
  the idea that the country has become an intolerant bunch of racists is frankly more of a meme than anything . 
  depends on the quality of the syrup , too . 
  c'mon then , source ? 
  you can use welsh once you learn to say [ llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyllllantysiliogogogoch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhxo0udpoxm ) . 
  i can send you some aluminium if you send me some wood . 
   hear that uk ? 
  yes , we hear that . 
  that 's one of the reasons we voted to leave . 
  nobody has said they want anyone to `` fuck off '' . 
  people want restrictions on the amount of people that can enter the country , that is all . 
  if people ca n't say that they want restrictions on the amount of people that enter a country without being labelled as xenophobic , then we could call every country in the world xenophobic . 
  ah yes , lets not defend people who boo at people who falsely represent their viewpoints . 
  she explicitly said she has never been discriminated against in the uk `` until brexit '' , but when quizzed about the way in which she is discriminated her answer was that `` people voted against the poles '' . 
  i 'm not surprised people booed . 
  total victim complex . 
  if that was the only thing she said , you 'd maybe have a point ( although saying `` i feel '' is still a generalisation ) . 
  she later went on to say that people wanted her out , and that the `` majority of the people voted against the poles '' . 
  no , she was booed for * saying * she was unwanted by `` 52 % of the voters '' , in a room full of people in an area which voted to leave - to which they booed because it 's an untrue statement . 
  when someone on the panel clarified that we want to stop immigration , just control immigration , some of the audience then clapped . 
  the polish lady then went on to say ( again ) that voters wanted polish people to get out . 
  but yes , lets pretend this was an outrageous thing . 
  the woman was accusing half the country of not wanting her in the country . 
  they were booing because it 's a strawman argument as very few people want eastern europeans to leave the country . 
  she was unfairly generalising them all , so they booed . 
  people not wanting to be generalised as xenophobes does not make them xenophobes . 
  fantastic news . 
  looks like those brimstone missiles are doing a great job .
