  / r/unitedkingdom is far too left for me . 
   both co-run by germans , had already planned to open offices in berlin but were jolted into speeding up their investments by britons ' june 23 decision do journalists get paid by the amount of articles they write ? 
  it 's also worth considering that the previous referendum was just two years ago . 
  people have now heard all of the arguments and witnessed all of the campaigning . 
  -1 for answering a question with polling data . 
  if the polls were anywhere near 10 % wrong , you 'd have a point . 
  but they were n't . 
  [ no ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ihg707zgux/scottishtrackers_25-jul-2016_indy_w.pdf ) . 
  1.427 from mothers of german citizenship . 
  still , looks like things have really started moving in the past 10 years . 
   it 'll be interesting if it goes ahead and scotland does actually gain independence from another referendum . 
  what 's the general consensus over there at the moment ? 
  from what i 've read the majority seem in favor of remaining in the eu , so are the majority in favor of independence too now since brexit ? 
  no , the polls show that not only do more [ scots prefer to be in the uk than in the eu ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ihg707zgux/scottishtrackers_25-jul-2016_indy_w.pdf ) , the [ latest scottish indy ] ( http://www.bmgresearch.co.uk/scottish-independence-voting-intention-results-september-2016/ ) polls also show that there is n't a big appetite for independence . 
  finland or norway, 
  bizarre that you ca n't seem to tell that he 's just spouting xenophobic shit , as always . 
  interesting definition of ` everyone ' . 
  super . 
  ah yes , comment on the source to avoid speaking of the content . 
  oh , just trident then . 
  mods - this title was n't editorialised . 
  this was the original title before bbc changed it . 
  brexit voter caught eating a straight banana !, 
   if i remember correctly the americans hold the codes for the uk 's nukes so they would be useless and we would be screwed . 
  source ? 
  sounds a lot like bollocks to me . 
  cool . 
  uh , no it 's not ? 
  it 's about 1.10 euros . 
  `` british election study '' are not members of the british polling council , therefore polls from them should be taken with a grain of salt . 
  when talking about such small percentages , tiny changes in the weighting used can make a huge difference . 
  oi , whatcha got against leeds ? 
  i 'm very pleased that we do n't use imperial in most manufacturing . 
  americans and their 3/32 drill bits . 
  urgghh . . 
  the will of the people ? 
  what ? 
  the majority of scots do n't want independence , according to the majority of polls . 
  tastes like arse, 
  our country is n't a joke . 
  people like you making dumbfuck comments about fucking peoples wives are the joke . 
  very cool video . 
  would 've been improve somewhat if there was an indication of where there was sustained fighting or bombing instead of just losing/gaining territory . 
   i 'm basically talking out of my arse yes , you really are . 
  you 've had no experience of what is taught in british schools , or how they 're taught . 
  but / r/europe will upvote you anyway . 
  damn brexi . . wait , my brain ca n't handle this . 
  technically she never was properly leader . 
  she 's just not continuing with the process of becoming leader . 
  anyway , although i do n't think i 'd ever vote for them , i 'm glad she 's stepping down . 
  i 've never really liked her . 
  i 'm hoping that woolfe manages to get leadership . 
  i imagine this has , too  as well as record levels of anti-semitic incidents in 2014, 
  do it . 
  even if you 'd bought a house just before the 2009 crash , you 'd still have made all that money back from the value increase . 
  buying a house in/around london is a no-brainer . 
  nope . 
  our economy would have suffered and i love having the queen in my pocket . 
  he knows he 's enraged , but he has n't quite worked out what he 's enraged about yet . 
  first was sovereignty and second was immigration , according to lord ashcroft polls . 
  or a xenophallic hate crime . 
  pretty much . 
  daily reminder that the uk is a big place . 
  in the past 12 months around 230,000 arrests were made in london alone for violent crime . 
  a disproportionate number of those offences are from foreign born nationals . . 
  in 2015 a foreign born national was arrested in london every 4 days for murder , 21 were arrested every single day for common assault , 5 were arrested every day for grievous bodily harm , 16 were arrested every day for actual bodily harm . 
  / r/europe is having a huge circle jerk over any incident they can find against eastern europeans right now , ignoring the fact that crime is just crime , and happens in every city , by people from all nationalities , to people of all nationalities . 
  all the poles getting upset on here at the threads where a polish person was attacked . . yet if you actually take a look at the stats , you 'll find that if you reported every case of a polish person getting arrested for assaulting someone ( in london alone ) here on reddit , you 'd be making 5 threads every day - alas , the news does n't bother reporting these things because it 's just regular occurrences . 
  all over the world there are cunts , it 's not limited to any particular nation . 
  right now reddit is wilfully ignoring the wood for the trees . 
  there are n't ** many ** more attacks . 
  there 's a lot more media attention given to them now . 
  there 's been a small increase , but keep in mind that certain users of / r/europe have even been crawling through small-time local news outlets looking for stories ( kentonline , shropshirestar . . etc. . ) this is a country with 64.1 million people . 
  even if there was a attack reported every single day ( trust me , / r/europe would find them !, 
  ) , that 'd be 365 attacks . 
  in contrast , there were 697 people from poland arrested in london alone in 2015 for `` actual bodily harm '' and 202 for `` grievous bodily harm '' . 
  had these attacks been british people attacking polish people the papers would label them an `` alleged racist attack '' . 
  attacks get labelled as racist even if racism was n't the motive , but racism occurred during the incident ( for example , a fight breaks out , and during the fighting one persons calls the other a polish cunt ) . 
  i 'm not trying to say `` look the poles are just as bad !, 
  '' , i 'm trying to show that the uk has a * lot * of people , and a * lot * of people from poland . 
  i love how people are downvoting this . 
  it 's a video from the police themselves all aboard the / r/europe circlejerk !, 
  from the police themselves . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqkz45rkeum it 's not all because of that , * reported * crimes that have increased . 
  people are hyper sensitive at the moment . 
  the key word being `` reports '' . 
  essex police ( and others ) said that many of that increase in reports were from people reporting things such as `` nigel farage was racist on tv '' . 
   there 's fuck all outside london anyway spoken like someone who has n't explored much of england . 
  i think you just sound like an introvert . 
  i 'm a fairly introverted person and some of the side effects of that are that i sometimes do n't `` fit in '' with what appears to be the social norm . 
  i mostly keep myself to myself and i 'm at my happiest when i 'm alone in the workshop or the office tinkering with things for 20 hours a day . 
  \\* proud \\*, 
  \\* might have, 
  2nd in both the olympics and paralympics . 
  not bad going . 
  i feel a bit proud , but in reality it was nothing to do with me . 
  i was sat on the sofa reading reddit . 
  you created a brand new account just to say that ? 
  big of you . 
   she flew to france to show solidarity with local muslims blimey . 
  surely you 'd have better luck finding people by just chatting to people in eu mm instead of on here ...
