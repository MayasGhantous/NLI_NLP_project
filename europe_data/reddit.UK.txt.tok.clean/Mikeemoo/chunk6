  you have this strange notion that british politics is somehow different from the rest of the world . 
  it 's the same everywhere - the reason british politics is discussed so widely is because so many people can ( and do ) read english-language media . 
  every single comment that any politician makes , every single poll and every local news story can be read by people all over the world . 
   it has left us a nation divided , bitter and angry this `` a nation divided '' thing is getting a bit old now . 
  it 's not divided at all . 
  except for a few delusional politicians ( such as david lammy and owen smith ) , most have accepted the result . 
  i 've not heard a single person discuss it irl for weeks now . 
  remember what , exactly ? 
  you can . 
  repost from yesterday . 
  can we stop linking to local news sites here please ? 
  are we seriously going to link to an article very time a polish person in the uk gets attacked ? 
  should we do it the other way around too ? 
  every time a polish person attacks someone ?? 
  in london alone in 2015 there were over 250 arrests of polish people for ` grievous bodily harm ' and 12 murders . 
  should we spam / r/europe with every incident of that nature ? 
  this is getting stupid . 
  i ca n't help but think that there 's certain members or / r/europe actively searching for polish attacks on small local news websites . 
  celebrating ignorance . 
  can we stop posting local news on here ? 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
   they were by definition voting for something does not mean you 're passionate about it . 
  i 'm fairly sure a large proportion of people voted to remain because they were scared of the economic argument . 
   apart from the significant number of brexiteers who have since recanted their vote yeah , except the polls show that is utter nonsense . 
  show me this `` significant number '' . 
  the polls show that there has been no shift in public opinion . 
  not a great idea to spout nonsense in a forum where people are aware of the facts . 
  commonwealth . 
  similar levels of wealth and they speak english as their main language . 
  we also do n't have disproportionate levels of crime from immigrants from those countries , but do from various eu countries . 
  steven woolfe would 've been a far better leader of the party . 
  diane james makes me feel ill . 
   ask a brit and it 's `` great ! '', 
  urhm , not spent much time in the uk , i guess ? 
  we 're not known for being a positive bunch . 
  i think you 've read my comment wrong , not the other way around . 
  what ? 
  those racist britis ... oh , everyone . 
  pretty sure we already have a dns filter , too . 
  woah there !, 
  this is the * internet * . 
  never accept defeat !, 
  civil would be my guess . 
  it 's fairly balanced according to all polls that have been done on there . 
  you 're a bit off , yes . 
  there 's been a few isolated cases , but attempting to tie any offence to some post-brexit racism is silly , especially in areas with very high polish populations . 
  motivated by a political campaign ? 
  where 'd you get that from ? 
  armley has had a huge influx of polish migrants in the past few years , and it 's a pretty poor area . 
  i think it 's fairly unlikely that this has anything to do with politics or the referendum . 
  i think the huge demographic change in armley in the past few years is far more likely a reason for the conflict . 
  source : i live 10 mins away, 
  you 've not heard any counter arguments to this ? 
  really ? 
  how about the fact that product standards are currently exactly the same in both the uk and eu ? 
  this being the thing that takes most of the time and all . 
  pot kettle black . 
  mine was built in 1892 . 
  i love it !, 
  you can have him . 
  as a leave voter , i 'm happy he campaigned for remain . 
  he really helped us . 
  you did . 
  i 'm still waiting for them to claim responsibility for my stubbed toe . 
  people who read the sun are n't the same people who read europa.eu . 
  mostly because of the tits . 
  i think they 've ditched that now , though . 
  someone took the time to debunk something that was written in ** the sun ** ... 
  it 's a borderline comedy rag . . just search google images for `` the sun headlines '' for such classics as `` dog ate my baby 's head '' , `` ramadan a ding dong '' , `` bin bagged '' , `` ufo hits wind turbine '' and `` girl eats 4,000 washing-up sponges '', 
  i feel as though looking at polls instead would be a considerably cheaper and less biased way of measuring support for independence . 
  the last campaign they did put them # 500,000 in debt ... http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/yes-scotland-500-000-in-debt-after-referendum-1-4215513  unionist parties said yes scotland going broke symbolised the risks of independence . 
  aww g ` won . . just a little one ... 
  no downsides . 
  just feels wrong to get an irish passport when i 'm not irish and only occasionally go to ireland . 
  plus , if i ever go travelling in the eu i 'd likely be with mrs mikeemoo , and she has no irish passport , so it does n't help much ( if there were visa restrictions.etc . 
  using nukes, 
  i 'm entitled to one , but would n't get one . 
  ahahaha , i love it . 
  so true !, 
  indeed . 
  part of me * wants * scotland to go purely because i know it 'll be this ridiculous nonsense every time * anything * happens in the country . 
  ... tories have the ability to implement what they say , and what they say they 'll do is what the majority of people want . 
  snp are full of hot air , and what they say they want to do is not what the majority of scots want . 
  the 4 columns are : ** total ** | conservative voters | labour voters | snp voters full survey here : https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/eva2tvwhn2/timesscotland_160831_results_website.pdf, 
  baseless assertion . 
  it 's not as though the idea of independence is new to scotland - the public do n't need `` preparing '' . 
  even sturgeon does n't output enough spin to be able to frame independence in a good light after the latest gers figures . 
  yes , but certainly does n't mean that 62 % wanted to stay in the eu enough to leave the uk . 
  a fact only made clearer by the polls on the subject . 
  our politicians have made it pretty clear that it 's unlikely we 'll be joining the eea , so i do n't think that 's the issue . 
  i think the idea that scots are just desperate to be in the eu is massively overblown . 
  after all , 38 % of them voted to leave the eu . 
  reddit seems to suck up everything that the snp says , regardless if it 's actually what the majority of scots want . 
  `` that card '' . 
  tony blair has little-to-no influence . 
  check any public opinion poll and you 'll see . 
  in fact , i 'd guess that tony blair supporting a particular thing would in actually work against whatever he 's supporting . 
  so yes , absolutely irrelevant what he thinks in the context you named him . 
  the best european countries are n't in the eu, 
  ahaha , a former pm . . who is ridiculously low in public opinion and who many people consider a war criminal .
