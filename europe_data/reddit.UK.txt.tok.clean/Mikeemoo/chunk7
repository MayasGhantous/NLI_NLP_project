  how is what tony blair thinks in any way relevant to anything ? 
  my local barbers opinion holds more weight . 
  parliament voted on whether or not to have a referendum . 
  even if it did end up going to a vote , it 's very unlikely that it would not get enough votes . 
  the majority of tories will stick to the party line . 
  hmm . 
   instead , the evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that all three buildings were destroyed by controlled demolition, 
  do they have wells now ? 
  http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=usd&amp;view=12h it 's quite a lot of movement for a single day - but the pound movement is a bit of a non-story . 
  the pmi is the interesting part . 
  `` pound strengthens due to increased manufacturing output due to a weak pound '' . 
  uh , yes ? 
  considering this article does n't say much at all . 
  parliament has been in recess and may has been on holiday . 
  always fun to see these `` but brexit has n't happened yet '' comments , usually from people who were the first to jump on the `` uk economy is crashing '' narrative straight after the vote . 
  $ urozone pmi 51.7 vs uk pmi 53.3 , btw . 
  anyone who has been to the north of england or east london has seen towns and cities where the ** majority ** of people are muslim . 
  i went to a shopping area on monday to get my bike fixed - every single woman i saw had either a burqa or niqab except for the shop assistants . 
  hahahaha completely missed them !, 
  wow ... 
  i think most people mainly have an issue with the covering of the face , that 's why people do n't particularly care about hijabs , but do n't like burkas and niqabs . 
  ( plus it adds to the segregation/isolation of the muslim communities , which helps the breeding of extremism ) . 
  i 've seen various layouts for the same chart . 
  here 's another : http://imgur.com/a/fnsvo i believe the data is compiled from the [ ipsos mori issues index ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3455/economistipsos-mori-september-2014-issues-index.aspx ) mixed with data from the figures from [ migration watch ] ( http://www.migrationwatchuk.org ), 
  the chance of labour winning an election ever again is rapidly diminishing . 
  con 41 % ( +1 ) lab 27 % ( -1 ), 
  man puts apples on steps before taking a photo and running away . 
  i suddenly feel very old . 
  i was a teenager when that happened . . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  although , i do understand the reasoning for it . 
  people voted leave for many different reasons , so it 'd be pretty tricky for her to be any clearer at a stage like this . 
  she 'd cause a lot of speculation and/or arguments throughout the country which would not settle down until she clarified things , which she ca n't do until after negotiations . 
  i imagine they 're being vague because they simply do n't know what the outcome of the negotiations will be , and they 're trying to avoid the `` negotiations via the media '' thing that seems to be happening at the moment . 
  ( `` x said this , y said this '' ) . 
  it 'll end up being a compromise . 
  i doubt we 'll take full control of immigration , but enough to allow us to reduce it to a reasonable level and keep most people happy . 
  i doubt we 'll get much single market access , but they 'll try to protect the most important parts and sacrifice the rest . . etc. 
  reducing immigration to a reasonable amount will keep a lot of people happy ... http://i.imgur.com/ukx5vws.jpg, 
  there 's a considerable amount of information about it on the european commissions website . 
  i 'm starting to really like theresa may . 
  it 's not as if eu countries have n't been the same to the uk !, 
  they keep saying . 
  yes , but it makes for an interesting headline !, 
  you should install reddit enhancement suite extension . 
  it does some clever things like keeping track of how many times you 've up/down voted someone . 
  no source , i was mostly just saying it for effect . 
  i do remember reading that lidl and another supermarket were having very good times , though - 12 % growth or something if i recall correctly . 
   apple says eu tax ruling will damage investment and job creation in europe , as it promises successful appeal uh oh . 
  ** germany : ** it 's failed :( ** france : ** my people wo n't like it !, 
  ** usa : ** things are going great, 
  we were told the prospect of the referendum itself was causing a slowdown in foreign investment . 
  so ... we 're getting no foreign investment , but at the same time seeing record levels of foreign investment . 
  our economy is crashing but at the same time doing extremely well . 
  supermarkets are struggling yet they 're seeing record profits . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  so , iceland is about to be responsible for the end of the world ? 
  thanks , iceland . 
  good going . 
  ca n't even be trusted with volcanoes . 
  i think you 're just paranoid or have other problems . 
  i tried , but i think he was just shouting back at me . 
  one step closer to war ? 
  reeeeeally ? 
  is this how a german person thinks ? 
  aye , i think it has a leeds postcode though . 
  he was on tv basically saying that he did n't like the eu , but was voting to stay because he did n't like the conservative government . 
  [ mandatory `` they have n't left yet '' comment ] however , if the economy genuinely is being boosted right now , that 's great . 
  q3 figures will be interesting . 
  this data is wrong for the uk , so i 'm not sure the data for any of the other countries can be trusted . 
  the most popular house type in the uk is a terraced house , which accounts for around 35 % of all housing . 
  if this is what they 're calling `` other '' , then it 's widely inaccurate . 
  about 32 % are semi-detached , 21 % are detached and 11 % are flats . 
  uk was on the losing end of ** the ** most votes in the eu . 
  or to put it another way , per cent of times in losing minority : http://ukandeu.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/figure-1-hix.png the argument that `` they were on the winning size [ x ] percent '' is largely irrelevant , as the majority of votes are just boring bureaucracy . 
  however , it 's clear from the data that the uk is the worst fit out of all of the eu countries , by far . 
  i appreciate that the romanians we have here are n't exactly standard-bearers for romanians - but i think the stats go some way towards showing why romanian immigration is viewed negatively in the uk . 
  probably the same for brits in spain . 
  we generally do n't export our best to spain . . 
  7719 london crimes commited by romanians in 2015 , out of a total of 64242 . notable types of crime were : * 1325 were from shop theft * 317 from fraud * 113 from gbh ( grievous bodily harm ) * 581 from common assault * 218 from handling stolen goods as for the `` 2-5 % population '' , the reason i did n't write an accurate number is because the government do n't actually know . 
  the closest figure i could find was from a survey made , which suggested approximately 2 % of londoners were romanian , but i decided to be generous . 
  anyway , funny that i 'm getting downvoted for telling the truth . 
  all the crime stats are available on the met.police.uk website . 
  whether you 're generous or not about the romanian population of london , they 're still committing relatively far more crime than most other groups of people . 
  romanians committed 12 % of all crime in london in 2015 . 
  romanians are around 2-5 % of the population of london . 
  hindus and sikhs integrate pretty well and rarely make the headlines by doing stuff like forming street gangs that do mass sexual exploitation of young girls , killing people and planning terror attacks . 
  they also do n't ghettoise areas as much . 
  i live in bradford . 
  this was bradford in 2011 : http://i.imgur.com/fblboqs.png it 'd be a hell of a lot more purple if they did a 2016 census . 
  the gap is explained by religion & culture . 
  indians integrate better than pakistanis . 
  pretty sure we 've got some unused nukes knocking about . 
  the shadow international trade secretary said it - part of the labour party that 's falling apart . 
  big news . 
  i did n't say it was up to me to decide . 
  i commented that he ( and you ) are obsessed . 
  my thoughts are that we do n't have to keep posting articles when * any * politician from * any * country says something that 's already been stated and discussed before . 
  `` britain ca n't cherry pick '' has been posted here countless times . 
  i feel like you 're utterly desperate to search for negative articles to post about the uk or brexit .
