  the sports funding started before beijing , not london . 
  most of the money ( about # 400m/year ) comes from the national lottery - from ticket sales . 
  the nhs is doing fine . 
  the article is n't half as bad as you expect it to be after reading that silly trumpet blowing headline . 
  road to nowhere, 
  quitaly . 
  `` a person who is not white . '', 
  not sure why anyone would downvote you for posting a reasonably accurate world map . 
  progressive bunch . 
  satire from the '' [ spitting image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yvcphrl.jpg ) '' book ( which was a tv show ) from 1985 , if anyone was wondering . 
  do you ever wake up and think to yourself `` i 'm a fucking idiot '' ? 
  i read many newspapers . 
  i 've never seen a poll suggesting that there 's any significant shift in public opinion , only a very tiny handful of politicians suggest the idea . 
  how should i proceed ? 
  how have you obtained this information ? 
  did you commission a poll from from a polling company ? 
  ooh so you mean * northern * ireland !, 
  but there 's a problem with your plan . 
  the majority of people in northern ireland do n't want to be independent . 
  how should i proceed , senpai ? 
  ireland * is * independent . 
  fucking british bastards !, 
  scumbags !, 
  the eu is better without them !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ doing ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  not sure how they managed to throw an entire city through a window, 
  i thought it was fairly uncharacteristic for the irish to be so rude , but from further investigation it seems that almost every offensive tweet i 've found so far has been from / r/the _ donald-style american teenagers . 
  of course , but the chance of dying in a car accident or drowning is something that has been fairly constant for your entire life , so it 's not something that is likely to weigh on your mind while trying to enjoy yourself . 
  i 'm not sure that saying there 's other places in the world that are more dangerous really constitutes any kind of argument . 
  if i was planning to go on a city break in europe i 'd a little less likely to consider paris right now because of the recent attacks . 
  many people go on holiday to feel completely relaxed , and even though the actual risk of being involved in any incident is extremely small , i can understand that it 's something people might not want in the back of their mind when they 're trying to enjoy themselves ( rational or not ) . 
  unsure of the relevance . 
  thank the lord . 
  reddit seems to have a hard-on for it . 
  it 's been posted here about 20 times . 
  no , i would n't . 
  i might make a website that lists tweets from random people on the internet . 
  it seems to pass as `` content '' . 
  unrelated , but , during the olympics i * knew * they were swiss athletes , but a small part of my mind kept telling me they were medics . 
  annnyway ...  that sounds a perfectly reasonable thing to do bbc are bloody racists . 
  how dare they !!!, 
   `` when voting on quotas the swiss had a system they knew well , which was freedom of movement , and a theoretical system , quotas , which was not very clear , '' he explained . 
   `` so i think they decided to vote for some sort of control over immigration , without knowing what it meant . '', 
  i guess they 've stolen that condescending argument from the remain campaigners . 
  scotland true yes . 
  there queen is london in, 
  yes , they do . 
  out of the hundreds of medallists , you 've picked out 2 of the current superstars that were almost certain to achieve a medal . 
   that 's not the point  you could 've brought only the 500 best athletes and the result would 've been the same . 
  err , i think you 're missing his point entirely . 
  countries often have surprise wins from teams or athletes you were n't expecting . 
  you ca n't plan for that . 
  there 's often no such thing as bringing your `` best '' team/athlete , because they all have good and bad days . 
  meh , i do n't even care how many medals each country got . 
  every government has different budgets and different things they want to spend their money on . 
  ensuring people have housing and care might even be considered more important than gold medals ( shock horror ! ), 
  watching people on here desperately try to claim that the eu is some kind of sporting powerhouse is quite embarrassing , though . 
  it 's like taking 20 penalties when everyone else takes 5 , then claiming you 're the best . 
  i love how desperate this is getting ... 
  member of the opposition party who desperately wanted to remain in the eu makes unsubstantiated claims . 
  alert the media !, 
  even the / r/unitedkingdom remain circlejerk acknowledge this article is utter rubbish . 
  completely meaningless . 
  ** edit : ** you 're all downvoting me , but actually take a look at the tables . 
  the only meaningful comparison is comparing individual countries year to year . 
  * romania got 4 medals less than last year * ireland got 3 less * germany got 2 less * finland got 2 less * hungary got 2 less * latvia got 2 less * netherlands got 1 less * lithuania got 1 less * estonia got 1 less * cyprus got 1 less * slovakia did n't improve * slovenia did n't improve * czech republic did n't improve * norway did n't improve * portugal did n't improve * italy did n't improve * spain did n't improve -- * france improved by 8 * denmark improved by 6 * greece improved by 4 * croatia improved by 4 * sweden improved by 3 * belgium improved by 3 * uk improved by 2 * austria improved by 1 * bulgaria improved by 1 * poland improved by 1 -- hardly something to be jerking yourselves off over . 
  of course , but it 's hardly surprising that a few people want to continue their free movement , considering 48 % wanted to stay . 
  news just in : 48 % of people did n't want to leave . 
  so dark . . 
  i discovered how weird taekwondo is . 
  especially the female taekwondo . 
  i do n't understand why they constantly make those squealing sounds ... and why do they punch if it * never * registers ? 
  what 's the difference ? 
  surely both are saying the same thing ... am i just having a blonde moment here ? 
  i really like the look of wind farms . 
  i know a lot of people do n't like them , but i think they 're pretty cool - i like what they represent . 
  part of me really hates the idea of gchq monitoring us so much and collecting all of our data . 
  however , another ( growing ) part of me feels safe because of it . 
  gchq seem to do a really good job of thwarting attacks . 
  i wonder how many times the press is going to tell us this . 
  i feel like this is a weekly story , saying the same thing . 
  a 9 on the global scale is a 7 on the sweden scale . 
  however , if the russian rio track & field team are anything to go by , maybe russia should be number one . 
  i like that character trait in a woman . 
  sweden . 
  i think you massively overestimate boris johnsons effect on the working class of the uk . 
  most of them think he 's a twat and i know a lot of people were put off voting leave because they did n't like him . 
  hmm you 're right . 
  the 2011 census shows a slight majority of pakistanis . 
  i like indians . 
  i find them very friendly . 
  what ? 
  i 'm not suggesting it did n't happen . 
  i 'm saying * exactly * what i intended to say . 
  that ** i ** did n't notice it , and i imagine that a lot of people in my position did n't . 
  not much as changed at all . 
  a few companies have claimed that they 're getting less business , a few have claimed they 're getting more business . 
  science at universities is apparently having problems because they 're not being considered for long-term projects . 
  holidays are apparently a bit more expensive because of the weak pound , but tourism has slightly increased . 
  aside from that , there 's not been much change .
