  i do n't speak french tho . 
  it 's okay mate . 
  not your fault . 
  i can only laugh hysterically at the clusterfuck this is turning into and drink scotch . 
  so ... which eu countries require people who work in it ? 
  go fuck yourself boris . 
  of course they should n't be bargaining chips . 
  they should be able to stay and have an easier route to get citizenship . 
  but we will have to give up free trade . 
  i hope the leave side is ready for that, 
  how would that be possible without freedom of movement ? 
  let our sacrifice not be in vain  also we may be in the hilarious ironic position of fleeing to europe for jobs, 
  learn from us eu . 
  this is just fucking unbelievable . 
  i ca n't believe the state of our politics at the moment . 
  been looking for options but realized i 'm eligible for visas outside of europe with my work exp . 
  so depending on the negotiation results - i 'm not panicking yet . 
  i ca n't get an irish passport . 
  dammit :(, 
  i guess it would be viable, 
  baby boomers final fuck you to the youth . 
  that wo n't make logical sense as so many decisions ( negotiations ) will require uk participation . 
  they ca n't legally . 
  it requires parliament approval, 
  happy to show you around if you make it across, 
  i need to gain another passport . 
  i 'm in shock tbh, 
  nothing will occur without gibraltar 's say so, 
  bloody hell . 
  i come back from my nap to this, 
  can london join you ? 
  smash the exam . 
  best of luck, 
  i dunno which is scary, 
  you have no idea mate . 
  she is my older sister tho so i 'm kinda scared of her, 
  i ca n't sleep . 
  this is so surprising, 
  so fucking smug . 
  quotes . 
  ` uk will run our own country ' . 
  ' i love the uk and more british than you because i voted leave ' . 
  ` this is god 's choice ' . 
  at least one person is happy . 
  my sister . 
  i 'd almost prefer hearing farage over her smug self, 
  sucks to be you . 
  i have holidays coming up and swapped my currency a week ago . 
  it 's been a fun ride . 
  i 'm going to drink . 
  been fun playing with you europe, 
  i do n't know how to ride a bike . 
  will you accept me, 
  nothing imo, 
  london ca n't . 
  do what we can not do, 
  i may have whisky, 
  how difficult is it ? 
  i 'm scared . 
  someone hold me, 
  so i need to emigrate, 
  bbc has declared leave victory, 
  it is true but the divide in uk is so clear . 
  north/south and london/scotland more isolated, 
  i laughed then i wanted to cry :(, 
  the pubs here are insane . 
  the reaction is so 50/50 . 
  half happy and half sad, 
  you know ireland is a different country out of uk, 
  im on shots . 
  im sad, 
  so ... you wan na go vegas ? 
  well fuck . 
  i only have a uk passport . 
  uk is split down the middle . 
  i did not anticipate this, 
  you 'll love us coverage, 
  i swear my vagina clenches everytime a result is announced, 
  fair play . 
  it may end up split, 
  dagenham ... im not surprised, 
  london !!!, 
  hopefully all boroughs follow suit . 
  2 mil mark, 
  back in the game !, 
  pub has gone insane, 
  some urban areas have declared but with different results than expected, 
  remain should be leading now . 
  this is honestly up in the air, 
  work at 9 . 
  leave has broken 1 mil mark . 
  london may also split . 
  lower turnout . 
  would ' t be surprised if we have other boroughs like sutton swing leave, 
  this will be . 
  im so tense , atmosphere in the pub is so split, 
  stay up but it 'll be a while, 
  been lower than expected turnout in london, 
  i agree . 
  if cities are split - that will be a worrying sign,
