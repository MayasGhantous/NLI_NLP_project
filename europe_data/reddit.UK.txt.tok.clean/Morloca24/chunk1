we should face our decay ? 
  we 're pretty much the only major economy in the eu growing and the eurozone is going to shit . 
  so many bitter frenchmen in this thread . 
  no , it 's still uk . 
  london is not a seperate entity , although doubtless some jackass will reply to this comment going `` lel dae london is leterally a parasite ? '' . 
  if this was paris , no frenchmen would be going `` everything 's coming up paris '' . 
  lol nice one m8, 
  everything 's coming up uk . 
  poland 2-0 germany , iceland 2-0 holland , england 1-0 estonia - it seems all the smaller teams are on the up !, 
  hmm . 
  eggs , toast , sausages , hash browns , black pudding , bacon ... think that 's it . 
  i think a scottish breakfast is just those + black pudding . 
  not sure about the others . 
  tldr various bits of meat between some bread, 
  that just looks like an english breakfast to me . 
  i swear , does every nation in the british isles just take the standard breakfast , add one more thing to it , and say it 's a scottish/english/irish breakfast ? 
  yeah , that 's bullshit , there 's tonnes of caf\u00e9s and restaurants in london that do english breakfasts . 
  it 's not `` difficult '' to find at all . 
  but we have the fastest growing economy out of all developed nations . 
  k m8 does it mean eurozone ? 
  cause i assume the uk is gon na grow more than 1.7 % next year . 
  sigh , i wish people would stop going . 
  i know it 's good to help , but really , you should try and protect your own life over the lives of some random african strangers . 
  on the weekends there 's the `` american football show '' or something like that , iirc . 
  on channel 4 . 
  eh , if you looked at the tv you would think that . 
  so many american football matches/shows on now . 
  however , you do n't really ever hear anyone talk about it . 
  i think it 's more of a gimmick at the moment , a curiosity thing - people watch it because they 've never seen it before . 
  i 'm from the north so i 'd happily agree that london was a third world shithole . 
  well , this makes us look like a third world shithole ... 
  badum tsh as a french learner i 'm really chuffed i got that joke as soon as i read it , yay :d, 
  report back when he answers !, 
  honestly , people go `` ah people will tut at you '' . 
  i have never observed that happening . 
  if you queue jump in the uk , you will either : be beaten up by a thug be forcefully told to get to the back of the queue be yelled at, 
  well , i ca n't argue with that , it 's pretty disgusting behaviour , if true . 
  i did n't say that brits should get a free pass . 
  i agree that some british immigrants can be absolutely disgusting , but that does n't mean other nationalities can come here because of the behaviour of british immigrants . 
  and there 's only 60 million insufferable brits , whereas there 's about 400 million insufferable americans . 
  hardly widespread . 
  could you give me an example of this `` rudeness '' ? 
  am i not allowed to have that opinion ? 
  i do n't want immigrants in my country . 
  simple as that . 
  you can call me a nazi or some shit like that , but you will find a lot of us share that opinion . 
   we want to integrate we do n't want you to . 
  we want you to go home , especially if you 're an american . 
  wow , i 've seen big ben and it 's big but not really too big . 
  i always regarded the statue of liberty as being some huge monolith , i did n't realise it was smaller . 
  hah , nope , we 're not the same person . 
  i 've just encountered one too many americans around the uk saying they 've come here to rediscover their `` ancestral roots '' etc etc , then they start acting as if they 're locals , using local slang , stuff like that . 
  it makes nationalities seem flimsy , as if you can just act like a native , and you suddenly become a native . 
  are americans really ashamed of being american ? 
  do they have to act as if they 're a special snowflake by claiming they 're from different countries ? 
  sigh . 
  also , / u/pilsnerprozim was correct . 
  you 've been there for 3 years and you already start thinking you 're a finn . 
  yes , technically , if you acquired citizenship you 'd be korean/japanese/nigerian whatever . 
  but the average korean or japanese would not think that way . 
  you would be regarded as an outsider forever , it does n't matter what you do . 
  you can never integrate into the society of a foreign land , people will always regard you as `` american '' or `` british '' or whatever . 
  you will never be finnish . 
  you can acquire citizenship , learn the language , watch their tv ( lol ) or whatever . 
  the average finn will regard you as american . 
  you will never be european . 
  yet , you claim to be a finn by your username - grumpyfinn . 
  i know that if an american came over here , became british etc , fully ` integrated ' into the culture , they would * always * be american to me and i would regard them as foreign and i would treat them as such . 
  life must be so hard for them . 
  everything 's coming up uk . 
  or , y' know , look at inequality adjusted hdi and the usa hurtles back to utopias such as poland and hungary . 
  because your average foreigner is almost always nicer than your average socially inept brit . 
  please , fuck off . 
  oh yes , i 'm sure that 's the main cause for the uk 's recent economic growth . 
  north of england , too . 
  '' ` ello cunt '' is the standard greeting between me and my friends . 
  yup , they replaced the education secretary , michael gove , who was already bad enough , with nicky morgan , who : voted very strongly for raising england 's undergraduate tuition fee cap to # 9,000 per year . 
  voted very strongly for academy schools . 
  voted very strongly for ending financial support for some 16-19 year olds in training and further education . 
  voted very strongly for university tuition fees . 
  voted moderately against equal gay rights . 
  fuck david cameron . 
  seriously . 
  hah , you 're a funny guy . 
  doubt we 'd have any people in the team to be honest ... 
  might aswell just hand europe the trophy every 4 years :p, 
  lol okay, 
  the eu is renowned for it 's ability to stand up for itself against the us . 
  exactly the same as the uk . 
  we were taught a pretty non-biased view . 
  british people do n't mind romanians at all , usually . 
  it 's only a few nutters you hear about in the media . 
  especially in london , there 's a lot of immigrants and people are accustomed to them by now . 
  people in the uk are friendlier than you think . 
  portugal has looked shaky and the us can pull a few surprises . 
  it 'll be an interesting game , for sure . 
  i 'm rooting for germany now this wc , hopefully that does n't summon the wrath of the british support curse . 
  as if china is any better , it 's the world 's sweat shop - shitty living conditions and generally unpleasant people . 
  yeah , where they 'll earn peanuts . 
   ** eurofighter crashes ** at spain 's ** moron ** base near seville although it 's very sad that the pilot died , i ca n't help but notice this .
