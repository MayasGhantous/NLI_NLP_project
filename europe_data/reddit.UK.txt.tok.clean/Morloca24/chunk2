  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_oil_exports k lol canada : 1,929,000 bit shit like . 
  also , nice lack of sources, 
   their there * . 
  also , there 's oil in the uk , yep . 
  not enough to supply what we need , but we can import oil from norway and america and a trillion other places . 
  i 'm sorry dude ... 
  i just ... 
  i ca n't help bursting out in laughter when a canadian talks tough . 
  ah , dude , there 's oil everywhere , not just in canada . 
  but i sense you 're a poor troll , so ... 
  you 're a funny guy, 
   once canada is rich from oil money things will change . 
  lol k, 
   smaller nations irrelevant nations that suck the uks dick for their money and power what nations would these be ? 
  hollande looks as if he 's telling merkel something and merkel 's going `` ah , yes , yes , vat a cunning plan '', 
  putin is isolated from the rest of the world leaders in the image , like how russia is `` isolated '' internationally . 
  well lithuania 's just went to shit , then . 
  we 'll attach a giant propeller to scotland , and sail all the way to china . 
  we 'll then proceed to become bff 's , and then if china goes to shit , we 'll sail to the next most powerful nation to kiss their arse . 
  yeah :p, 
  no , i 'm saying poland is the ** frontier ** . 
  if russia invaded , it would be where land is gained and lost . 
  yes , but the eu is most likely going to be fighting on home soil . 
   so intelligence and logistics are a non-factor when it comes to power projection ? 
  i did n't say that . 
  i do . 
  but these are minor failures in eu warfare , they 're not going to justify an increase in defence spending . 
  especially when it 's only the americans here who are paranoid about big scary russia . 
  they 're not the soviet union anymore . 
  they 're not a threat . 
  their ships fall apart in the harbor and they have major logistical failures . 
  the eu does not need to project power . 
  it 's military can easily handle russia , and i think you forget that two eu states have nukes . 
   ** helped **  ** it pulled back from the front-line operations . 
  ** `` but america 's role remains essential , not least in providing air-to-air refuelling , as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the european allies . '', 
  you 're kicking up a fuss over the eu because of * this ? 
  * it 's not exactly major . 
  tell me , what issues did the eu have with power projection in libya ? 
  by that , i meant individual partners . 
  britain usually buys more than it exports . 
  haha !, 
  well , when a war is fought , the invader usually captures a bit of land before they are repelled . 
  that land in question would probably be poland or the baltics , so it 's probably inevitable . 
  '' * power projection * '' ? 
  mate , the eu and russia are right next to each other . 
  it 's like saying if canada was gon na invade the us they 'd need `` power projection '' . 
  seriously . 
   poland and the baltics seem to feel very threatened . 
  as much as i like poland and the baltics , they 're not exactly too important and i 'm pretty sure the eu would be able to mobilize troops there extremely quickly . 
   the eu will fk the brits over so bad that is neither in the eu 's or the brits interest . 
  britain is a massive cash cow for europe , they do n't want to lose that . 
  try again though . 
  yeah , but the outrage over it is n't the same . 
  america does this : everyone is up in arms . 
  germany does this : meh . 
   except you know , we give back more than we take from westminster . 
  not true . 
   is that really how you see scotland ? 
  as a thing , an item that is owned by westminster ? 
  yes, 
  it is true about navy tech . 
  type 45 , astute class subs absolutely dominate . 
  even the americans were amazed . 
  note the words modern \uff0c deployable . 
  the economy of italy is 800 billion dollars smaller . 
  italian military tech is less developed . 
  ask any fucking person on subs like / r/warshipporn or / r/militaryporn . 
  you seem to be under the impression that brits are still dreaming about the empire . 
  most brits never even think about the empire in their daily life . 
  just because your nation is a fucking shitthole nowadays , dont drag us down with you . 
  it 's a testament to the anti-uk attitude that your comment has 4 upvotes , while mine has none . 
  awww , look at the widdle italian who thinks italy is powerful . 
  adorable !, 
  i was replying to the `` they do n't really matter '' comment . 
  any state with modern , deployable nuclear weapons matters . 
   we pretty much ignore them because they do n't matter . 
  i 'm sure their massive nuclear arsenal disagrees . 
  that 's not what i said ... 
  when i meant big scary state , i meant russia . 
  oh yes , i 'm sure the eu will be happy to take action when it 's not a big scary state being targeted . 
  in fact , they probably wo n't do anything - that 's the eu way . 
   do n't kid yourself , once you leave we are n't friends itt : redditors making decisions for entire nations, 
  apparently i 've downvoted lispm 4 times in the past , so probably no point arguing with him . 
   bigotry  but you are a product of the british education system so i can take pity on you . 
  also from your comment history :  it 's ok , in the us , you 're pictured as having crooked brown teeth , white trainers , puma tracksuit trousers , a newcastle kit top , being very pale and pasty , skinny but with a giant gut . 
  also very drunk and loud . 
  lol okay, 
  ** april 2005 -- frontier times and 21st century research ** ** telephone poll of over 1,000 adults , with a margin of error of 3.1 % . 
  ** greatest threat to south korea 's security : first , the united states ( 29.5 % ) ; second , japan ( 29.2 % ) ; third , north korea ( 18.4 % ) . 
  44.4 % of south koreans believe north korea 's nukes are good for korea . 
  ** 45.7 % of people in 20s and 50.1 % of students believe the u.s. is the number one threat to korea . 
  ** - see more at : http://freekorea.us/2001/08/16/ofk-archive-anti-americanism-in-koreathe-statistical-record/#sthash.ymwoequn.dpuf oh okay . 
  dang , you 're really defensive about good ol' murica are n't you ? 
  hah , and you insulted the british education system , you fucking burger munching americunt . 
  probably had a swedish great-great-great grandfather and now you 're embracing your `` long lost culture '' ... 
  yup , the koreans , japanese and vietnamese are n't , on a whole , fond of the us . 
   the bigger the area the country has to cover how would this work ? 
  as in coast to defend ? 
  uhm ... 
  so , they 're ahead in polls , and they want to leave the eurozone ?
