  if so , that 's really worrying ... 
  to a non-frenchman , what exactly does this mean ? 
  why is it disturbing ? 
  mate there 's no point trying to talk sense in / r/europe . 
  the anti uk circlejerk is strong here . 
  well , considering the uk is the biggest investor in the us and the us is the biggest investor in the uk it makes sense . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom%e2%80%93united_states_relations  the uk has always been the biggest foreign investor in the us and vice versa . 
  basically , / r/europe attitude is `` if a country is friendly with another , ermahgerd pet lapdog !!!!, 
  ! 1111oneeoneo '' . 
   `` we are not only each other 's largest investors in each of our countries , one to the other , but the fact is that every day almost one million people go to work in america for british companies that are in the united states , just as more than one million people go to work here in great britain for american companies that are here . 
  so we are enormously tied together , obviously . 
  and we are committed to making both the u.s.-uk and the u.s.-eu relationships even stronger drivers of our prosperity . '', 
  dat feel when anglo, 
  i live in tyne and wear !, 
  might check it out !, 
  sadly , that 's true . 
  what pissed me off is this , though :  he claimed he wanted a `` republic of london , '' and that the city could be improved if other areas of the uk were n't so busy sucking all the blood out of it seriously ? 
  what a colossal twat . 
  i 'm not sure you understand the concept of source . 
   the uk has * a lot * of politicians that think russia and putin are amazing source for that please ? 
  look , i know the uk has n't been * that * supportive , but they 've been more supportive than most other countries - e.g. 
  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2603411/uk-typhoons-patrol-skies-baltic-nato-strength-warn-putin-invading-ukraine.html i know this is n't in poland , but at least we 're doing something . 
  also , be careful in the use of the word * europe * . 
  in this case , i think you mean poland . 
  the uk cares plenty about france and germany . 
  i think the uk would have been more outspoken about the issue if it had more eu members alongside it . 
  in europe , it was mainly the uk calling for ( and actually preparing ) sanctions . 
  the germans and the french stood idly by . 
  there 's one in the uk too . 
  i think he 's so well remembered because of the * morals * he stood for , not the cause he fought for . 
  it 's a bit hard to generalise the entire asian continent ... 
  best of luck to you !, 
  how old are you , may i ask ? 
  edit : i mean this in the least offensive way possible ; i 'm just curious . 
  well , i know you 're adamant on staying in europe , but why do n't you consider south korea ? 
  working hours for english teachers in korea are very flexible , and with your violin skills and physics degree you 'd make an * excellent * living ; parents in south korea really want the best for their kids , and a foreigner with a degree from a `` prestigious western university '' would make a killing . 
  south koreans see western universities as very , very ` premium ' , especially british and american ones . 
  also , you 've got japan and china at your fingertips !, 
   it 's more or less the de facto ` capital ' of europe . 
  that 's a rather arrogant sentiment . 
  paris , london and madrid are all bigger in terms of gdp . 
  what the fuck ... 
  * do they speak in a high pitched tone ? 
  check * * do they wear feminine clothes ? 
  check * * do they walk funny ? 
  check * 100 % foolproof test . 
  it 's sad to see ukraine like this but i fear the us and uk will do nothing . 
  http://horizon2020projects.com/ well , looking at the front page , i can see at least 3 mentioning switzerland , and one involving research cooperation with brazil . 
  yes , and a lot of those projects will involve nations outside the eu . 
  your point is ... ? 
  are you nitpicking or something ? 
  you have ignored a point i made . 
  the funding is provided by 28 member states ; i 'm fairly certain there will be disagreements somewhere . 
  nah mate , i 'm having a hard time finding any . 
  i 'm fairly certain the uk would not miss projects such as * discovering the tick !, 
  name some eu research programmes that are * exclusively * the eu 's . 
  no international involvement . 
  we 're arguing an absolutely retarded idea here . 
  firstly , the eu would never withdraw funding ; the member states would not allow it and there is no benefits . 
  secondly , the funding is from the member states in the first place . 
  are you * genuinely * saying that the eu would withdraw funding to spite the uk ? 
  please , give me some of what you 're smoking . 
  provide a resource ; i can not find any . 
  no , cause the eu does not fund the esa , individual members do . 
  also , what the fuck does the eu have to gain by removing funding ? 
  sorry , let me reword my comment . 
  the eu has no * major * power within the esa . 
  also , that policy is more like an alliance with the eu rather than joining the eu . 
  you said `` you are out of european institutions '' , the esa is not part of the eu , therefore it makes no difference if the uk leaves the eu as the eu has no power within the esa . 
  aye , but in your statement you did n't say * some * european countries are smaller in population than chinese cities . 
  glad we cleared that up though . 
   european countries are as big as cities in their countries eh ? 
  esa is n't actually part of the eu ... 
  i do have a conscience , and i am a decent human being . 
  i just could not give a shit , because as soon as the government tried anything worse than this , there would be riots in the streets . 
  therefore , they will * not * try to do anything worse than this . 
  there 's a difference between caring and concerning you . 
  it does concern you , because they 're monitoring you . 
  but you do n't care about it . 
   i do n't care  i just should n't give a fuck ? 
  wot, 
  oh , poor you , having your webcam images intercepted . 
  here 's a little fact : the government does n't give a fuck about you . 
  every other nation is doing this , they 're just better at hiding it . 
   they took mali by storm , it was a textbook clean intervention . 
  yep , this is what i do n't get . 
  how can a military power like france successfully complete an intervention , whereas the us has been pissing about in the middle east for 10 years and the `` terrorists '' are as strong as ever ? 
  i think it 's just counting places britain has had troops stationed . 
  i remember reading a comment that said it also counted pirates who were employed by the uk . 
  really ? 
  there 's rather large fines for littering in the uk , they can be up to # 1000 . 
  well , first off , `` europe '' is not a single entity , it has many countries . 
  it does better in ... military . 
  that 's about it . 
  yeah , but they usually identify it with being culturally scottish , which they are not . 
  it 's opt in . 
  the filter is not a `` porn '' filter , as the media likes to put it . 
  it is a filter on generally offensive content that children , apparently , should n't see . 
  this is just an expansion of that filter , which , i must remind you , is * optional * . 
  any country that has a point to prove against a separatist movement .
