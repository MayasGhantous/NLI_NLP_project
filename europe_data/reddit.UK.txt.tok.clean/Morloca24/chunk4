  it holds some truth . 
  there 's 28 members , and it only takes 1 to throw a spanner in the works . 
  and what did the snp do ? 
  claim barroso is spouting nonsense , like they do every time they 're proven wrong . 
  nothing . 
  but it 's not better than the uk . 
  on a first-world scale , every country is the same as another . 
  it 's what you make of it that counts . 
   usa - better . 
   new zealand - better . 
  `` muh grandad was half scottish therefore i am a scottish-american '', 
  no problem , take care . 
  hmm . 
  i 'm a brit and you pay for university here , so i 'm not too sure . 
  i know , however , in places like norway and sweden and maybe germany med school is free . 
  edit : i should add , a doctor 's wages in the uk are rather poor compared to the us , however university is still paid for . 
  in the case of those who are `` career '' doctors - those who are in it for money - that is sometimes the case . 
  usually , though , a doctor who is in it to genuinely help people will stay where ever they are . 
  he means that her dad could of used a phone/internet service like `` just eat '' to order the chinese meal . 
  i can imagine the conversation . 
  `` it 's the teme ... temera ... fuck it let 's just call it ` ship ' '' . 
  i gave it a shot and it sounded a bit like `` tehmehreh '' , heh . 
  in this post : statements without sources for a canadian you sure have your head lodged firmly up the us ' rectum . 
  what ? 
  just cause the us has a retardedly large army they 're the `` world hegemony '' ? 
  war is economic nowadays mate , and the us is falling behind . 
  haha , that 's true . 
  in my comment i was just referring to countries in general . 
  it they go against the eu , they will eventually get some hate . 
   here we go again , another persecution complex . 
  what ? 
  note the word * any * . 
  if i did not sport a british flag you would n't say that . 
   it 's a goddamn conspiracy because everything is about britain when the fuck did i say that ? 
  basically , any country that says something against the eu is singled out . 
  there 's many people who are douchebags on / r/europe other than britons , but they 're not singled out as much as us . 
  also , keep using that word ` arrogant ' . 
  it does not mean what you think it means . 
  because people like to bring up shit like `` tories denounce eu for the trillionth time '' for karma from / r/europe 's predominantly anti-uk population . 
  shh , do n't post this stuff on here , do n't you know the uk is the spawn of satan ? 
  us lost the world hegemony when china arose as a competitor . 
  [ * ` rance !,

  the `` little racist '' part was entirely unnecessary . 
  also , `` little racist '' sounds like something a toddler would write . 
  am i supposed to be insulted ? 
  call me whatever you like , i do n't give a toss . 
  false . 
  `` romanian '' is not a race . 
  probably romanian . 
  where are you from ? 
  you could at least show your country instead of hiding behind an eu flag . 
   we qualified for the rugby wc ... romania has a rugby team ? 
  that 's the problem . 
  there 's too many damn americans here so it still floats . 
  that does n't override the fact it 's an american movie . 
  if there was an / r/usa , and someone posted a european movie on a thread like this , there 'd be uproar . 
  look , you even have your own thread now !, 
  since this is posted in / r/europe i 'm assuming op was only asking european members ... 
  for some reason someone has went and downvoted every thread in there ... o.o, 
  it does n't take a genius to read the report and actually find that most of the jobs were full time . 
  it 's a shame , sarkozy was very pro-uk . 
  piss off , contrary to what you read in the daily fail we 're not all eurosceptics . 
  true , the pay may be low . 
  however , it 's about contributing to society as a whole , even if the pay is only a little better than the dole . 
  preparing for the / r/europe `` ermahgerd most of these are part time ... '' . 
  it depends on the school you work for . 
  does n't help that the government constantly shits on teachers . 
  yeah , but i think what he 's saying is america has destabilized far more countries than it has stabilized . 
   grow the fuck up  jesus christ , you 're a whiney little bitch lol what do i have to be inferior about ? 
  living better than you ? 
  free university and healthcare ? 
  a generally higher standard of living ? 
  do n't pull that `` b-b-but if u pay with taxes its not free !!!! 111oneone '' . 
  you do n't seem to realise that we do want non-europeans in our sub , but not ones that 'll start touting that `` ermahgerd america no. 1 world police '' . 
  if you 're here to inspire discussion , that 's great , but you knew that the kind of discussion you were inspiring would lead to people being pissed off . 
  yeah if you could stop childishly downvoting my comments , that 'd be great . 
  also , your entire comment was pretty much `` ermhagerd america big and stronk much peace such wow very super power '' . 
  mate , by 2030 china will have overtaken you . 
  i like how you say ` our ' . 
  you are just another common american munching on the shitty scraps thrown to you by your superiors . 
  you have no power in your country . 
  get the fuck out , americunt . 
  but you are n't . 
  you are a threat to global peace because you stick your fucking nose in everything . 
  you are allowed here and you are allowed to be interested in europe . 
  however , like the majority of americans in / r/europe , please do not come here to be a cock . 
  why are you in / r/europe ? 
  it does indeed ; many people will take this as `` ermahgerd teh muslims r invading '' ( usually daily mail readers ) but really , it 's not as if there 's gon na be a sudden influx of muslims just because a bank decided to make a muslim friendly bank account . 
  no , this is just the uk trying to stay ahead in it 's occupation as the main financial centre ( london , anyway ) . 
  true . 
  in all fairness , your english is superb . 
  i 'd say you were fluent . 
   i know its tough and you still think you rule the world when the hell did any of us say that ? 
  i agree muhammedallah is a total fucking idiot but there 's no need to be a dumbass . 
  according to your comment history you 're british too , so you 're obviously exploiting / r/europe 's anti-uk tendencies for karma . 
  brit here - i actually really like that house , haha . 
  it 's still based in britain , has a british ceo , and the british own as much shares as the americans do . 
  the us is a big market , you would be stupid not to go into it . 
  business is international these days , and i do n't get why people use bp as an example so often .
