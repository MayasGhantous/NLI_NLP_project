  look at unilever and royal dutch shell - anglo-dutch companies . 
  preparing to get downvoted for stating fact , that 's the / r/europe way . 
  uk here , i do n't even need to explain . 
  who the hell cares about this anymore ? 
  they can make nuclear missiles but they ca n't make a ski-lift ? 
  true , but the thing is they just do n't have the money to exploit them . 
  i read recently they were letting china mine them and apparently china was giving north korea a ( probably small ) cut of the goodies . 
  ah , thanks for the explanation . 
  i knew there had to be a reason for doing this . 
  france , spain , italy and greece are n't doing `` just fine '' , and the countries that are doing okay are , as you put it , `` just fine '' . 
  not great , `` just fine '' . 
  what , did latvia see how other euro countries were doing and thought `` oh , i got ta get me some of that !, 
  who and whom are easy mistakes to make , in fact , i did n't know about it until recently either . 
  i was referring to the toddler-like grammar and spelling demonstrated in some of those comments . 
  oddly enough , every `` eurosceptic '' i 've seen tends to have incredibly poor grammar , a bit like those comments in the article . 
  i think the reason they ca n't get a job is n't because of the immigrants , it 's because they 're too stupid themselves . 
  i 'm fairly certain it was after the election . 
  the 2014 votes are for scottish independence . 
  you 're saying this over one judge ? 
  not all of us want to leave the eu , and neither does cameron , he 's just saying that shit to please some of his eurosceptic party members . 
  stop being so fucking stupid . 
  jackblack2323 is saying that , if the uk had the highest gdp in europe , some countries may have an inferiority complex about it . 
  also , to your comment : wtf ? 
  it 's a popular trend with / r/europe . 
  people like to jump on the uk hate bandwagon . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/british_and_french_empires_1920.png/250px-british_and_french_empires_1920.png found a map . 
  if you 're working are n't you not a full time student ? 
  such a sensationalist title . 
  it states , `` as to not damage relations with * allies * '' . 
  i do n't see why they feel the need to make up the `` including the us '' part . 
  logic ? 
  my dear boy , you must be mistaken . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  that 's the point , people will learn chinese and therefore become translators . 
  growth has actually been very strong this year , i think it will actually become the fastest growing economy . 
  i agree that viking83 is in the wrong here , but i 'd just like to point out that he 's not being racist as `` irish '' is not a race , but a nationality . 
  [ why are you even on a subreddit about europe when you 're just gon na annoy us ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union the economy of the eu is the largest in the world . 
  when i think of british engineering i think of ... mclaren . 
  architecture . 
  trains . 
  ships . 
  thanks !, 
  as a brit , i 'd like to know more about this . 
  can you show me a source/website ? 
  why is it always the germans who are crying for the uk 's exit of the eu ? 
  are we too much of a thorn in angela 's 4th reich ? 
  just kidding . 
  how dare you state fact !, 
   congressman stopped reading there, 
  i do n't think this guy has actually been to england . 
  i 'm english and i 've been to scotland , it 's pretty much the same as england . 
  fyi : this is the guy responsible for this : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1p98n1/upvote_if_you_thing_romania_is_the_best_country/ and his post history is full of ... well , his idea of `` england bashing '', 
  what ? 
  polish culture is vastly different to , say , spain . 
  the great thing about europe is that there 's a huge range of cultures . 
  no one really knows , to be honest . 
  we give the government a lot of shit for some reason , but they 've done a decent job of turning the economy round . 
  people 's wages are still stagnant though and the cost of living is going up . 
  no , because `` romanians '' are not a race and neither are bulgarians . 
  the correct term is xenophobic , which we are not , either . 
  we just do n't want more people in our already overcrowded country . 
  you said , `` racist little country '' . 
  who are we being racist to ? 
  how so ? 
  i have a hard time believing the part where britons are actually * moving * to get benefits , but i do believe the part where people have lost jobs and are now claiming benefits . 
  i 'm british myself and people here are too lazy to move to another city , nevermind a country . 
  although i suppose that 's the case in every country . 
  yep . 
  americans will probably call themselves scottish if they have a great-great-great scottish grandfather or something . 
  jeez , you must be fun at parties . 
  / r/europe tends to be quite anti-uk . 
  for example , when the news that the uk economy was picking up was broken , it was downvoted to hell . 
  but when the german economy grows , upvotes for everyone !, 
  it 's stupid . 
  me too , redditors just like to group society into the `` super rich '' and `` poor people '' . 
  tbh , it probably is really spicy but i 'm accustomed to eating really spicy curries so to me it was just `` meh '' . 
  i 've had currywurst from a german shop owned by german people , it was alright . 
  found it a bit sweet for curry though . 
  never had a proper doner , just the shitty takeout ones . 
  what are spain gon na invade with , sticks and stones ? 
  it 's all they 've got . 
  does n't albanian have 27 words for mustache ? 
  huh ? 
  i think you mean the vending machines . 
  other countries i 've been to have vending machines where the drinks are kept cold , but here pretty much every vending machine has warm drinks . 
  americans love to love themselves and call their country awesome , but as soon as a foreigner criticizes them , they fly into a rage . 
  what , do you want a medal ? 
  i like this , very rousing indeed . 
  yeah , i 'm not sure if what i said was accurate , i just heard it on the news once when i was walking past the tv on my way upstairs . 
  edit : i think they might have said it will come out ahead in a couple of years . 
  it brought in money , but not much else . 
  the difference is france is n't on a long term trajectory for that kind of sustained growth . 
  the economy is on the mend , it recently grew 0.7 % in q2 . 
  do n't take this too seriously , as i read it in the mail , but i read that british-german trade was growing , and german-french trade was declining . 
  i 'm really not surprised that in france 's economic climate that its losing customers . 
  thank you , this is kind of what i was trying to say . 
  it 's a shame that they focus on the harsh language , i personally think that german and dutch sound nice , and i usually get odd looks when i say that . 
  i 'm learning german at the minute , but definitely considering learning dutch alongside it when i 'm at a `` suitable level '' . 
  meaning , when i 'm able to read a newspaper without having to look up any words or something .
