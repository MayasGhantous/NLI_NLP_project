  instead we brought the might of our military and that of our empire to europe 's aide and fought the war on four continents and all five oceans . 
  after the end of the war whilst we were rebuilding our decimated country , which we did n't have to have bombed to hell but chose to risk that happening because europe needed help , nations in the empire used the opportunity to leave . 
   britain still needs to get some sort of deal with the eu ultimately we do n't . 
  whilst it is polite and convention to , we can just leave . 
  we 're not some pissant poverty stricken african shithole nation . 
   eu negotiators will not continue negotiating if a eu member does not approve britain 's article 50 . 
  that 's how it is for every deal , and it will apply to brexit negotiations . 
  and then we 'll just walk away from the eu . 
  what you going to do if the uk does ? 
  nothing . 
  we 're the worlds fifth richest nation , we have a gdp which is 1/8th of the eu 's total economy , the city of london finances most of the eu , we 're a nuclear power . 
   we can even pay for the gunboats in the channel to keep you out . 
  is that before or after the royal navy sends them to the seabed ? 
  the vast majority of their business is uk domestic and non-eu , the same as the city . 
  the usa is a third world country ? 
   when the uk leaves the single market , prices for imported goods will rise depends on the trade deal . 
  for the uk it is likely to mean the price for imported goods from countries from outside of the eu are going to fall as we 're able to do our own trade deals and apply our own tariffs . 
  the eu , depending on what deal they decide they want to do , could end up in the situation where we choose to apply a higher tariff to a widget from the eu than the same widget from a non-eu country and the eu businesses lose uk custom as we shift to buying it from elsewhere . 
   but once price inflation kicks in assuming a favourable deal does n't happen then that is only going to happen to goods we ca n't get from elsewhere . 
  impose tariffs with the uk imposing tariffs in response to goods from the eu but applying a lower tariff or none at all for goods from non-eu nations and we are likely to move to buying them from there . 
  uk prices drop or are maintained , eu businesses lose customers in the worlds fifth richest country . 
   i 've seen estimates that put the costs of imported/exported goods rising by 5 % to 10 % due to increased administration costs . 
  that would be ridiculous . 
  it takes very little time to do the paperwork on exported goods . 
  i 've sold goods to countries outside of the eu and had to do the paperwork . 
  took very little time to do it . 
  20-30 minutes of one office staff members costs on a 20 tonne load of goods worth $ 10,000 s is going to add next to nothing . 
   anti-british sentiment is spreading all over europe , its always been there . 
  funny how quickly they forget how we gave up our empire to rescue them from nazi germany . 
   the richest areas of spain are the ones without tourism . 
  and many of those are selling food to the uk ... 
  you do n't have to be in the single market to sell to it . 
   if you are out of the common market there are literally 0 reason to move to the uk instead of any other tax heaven . 
  other than it being the worlds # 1 global financial centre for over a century ... 
  why would the government receive less tax ? 
   also why would the companies move to the uk when they do n't get access to the single market ? 
  you do n't need to be in the single market to sell to it . 
  the largest non-eu economies have no problem selling to the eu . 
  from tfa ...  two of europe 's biggest banks ** warned ** on wednesday ** that they could ** each move about 1,000 jobs out of london as they prepare for expected disruption caused by britain 's exit from the european union . 
  warned and could , not announced they are definitely going to be . 
   and forbide any corporation working in the eu to send its taxes outside it . 
  which is completely and utterly impossible to do and has never been achieved . 
  if it ever did happen then just watch every major company leave the eu . 
   or put sanctions on the uk just like on russia roflmao . 
  not really going to happen when we 're many of the eu nations largest customers . 
  we 're not a basket case economy like russia is . 
   eu embargo on food would be fun to watc we can source it from outside of the eu . 
  spain would be bankrupt as a result of such an embargo though . 
   or , or , or ... there are gazillions way to fuck you up if you start a dirty brexit . 
  works both ways . 
   450 millions people millions of whom come from poor former soviet bloc countries . 
   50 % of all your export the eu has n't been anywhere close to 50 % of our export market for quite a long time now . 
  no problem though , bring on the sanctions and tariffs . 
  that 'll fuck up many of your businesses in the eu as they use uk goods/services and the eu is becoming a smaller percentage of uk exports every year . 
  i believe you 've dropped down to just above 40 % and once we leave the eu that percentage will plummet as we are able to trade more freely with the rest of the world instead of being tied to a failing trading bloc . 
  it would n't be a massive loss in tax because you would have far more money being funnelled through the uk by many many more companies . 
  if you halve corporation tax to 10 % but you end up with double the number of companies funnelling double the amount of profit through the uk then your corporation tax losses are # 0 . 
   but no one plans to move if it 's not necessary , right ? 
  wrong . 
  its called having a contingency plan . 
  companies and governments have contingency plans for all kinds of things that never happen so they never get implemented . 
   and if she does n't get what she wants , she will unleash a trade war on the eu , with tax and social dumping . 
  she never said that . 
   the banks are already moving on the continent . 
  no they 're not . 
  they 're `` planning to . '', 
  not one has actually moved yet . 
   a trade deal is n't the priority for the eu riiight . 
   worst case scenario you 'll be at wto tarrifs and that 's that . 
  and then we cut the fuck out of our corporation tax and watch all those eu companies move to the uk ... 
  the only retaliation mentioned was one in response to the eu trying to give us a good kicking and make an example of us if the eu chooses to go down that path . 
   there is no obligation to negotiate whatsoever . 
  other than the fact that london banks provide 50 % of all financing in the entire eu , that the gdp of the uk is more than 19 eu nations combined , that the uk is the reu 's largest customer matching the usa ... 
   one of the biggest banks is already planning its escape i 'd hardly call moving just 1000 out of its 48,000 uk workers being an escape . 
  yes , their london operations . 
  why would it be more beneficial to tell the other side what the absolute worst case scenario you were prepared to accept was ? 
  if you go for a job interview and they ask you what salary you want do you say straight away the absolute lowest figure you 'd be prepared to accept or do you start higher ? 
   how will eu citizens living in the uk be treated if all goes well ? 
  the same as they 've always been . 
  personally i think the whole claim that they 're now being treated badly is being blown up beyond all proportion . 
   and is the uk at risk of turning into a tax haven ? 
  i 'm fine with that , ireland did n't give a shit when it did it for apple , google etc. 
   it took her this long to merely announce exactly what the plan is to the british public personally i think she should n't have announced anything . 
  you do n't show your cards in negotiations before you 've even started . 
   and the reason the city of london is the financial center is because the uk is in the eu . 
  no , the reason the city of london is the worlds leading financial center is because it has been for over two hundred years thanks to centuries of britain trading worldwide and the british empire . 
   do you think that if the uk is disallowed from clearing euro transactions , that the banks wo n't up and leave ? 
  yes because the fact we 're the worlds fifth richest nation aside , only between 5-9 % of total business done in london has anything to do with the eu . 
  the vast majority , over 90 % , is uk domestic and non-eu trade . 
  we know what out means , the pm gave a speech today . 
   you 're not gon na get any deals that any other non-eu country got before since you 're leaving the eu . 
  yeah we are because half the borrowing done in the rest of the eu is with city of london financial institutions . 
  basically the city of london owns collateral in half of the eu , something which no other nation does . 
   sure you can trade with these 168 other countries + the usa , but only after you have renegotiated new trade arrangements with these countries and markets to replace the trade arrangements that you had with the rest of the world through the eu and that you will lose once you are out . 
  rubbish . 
  we 're not going to have to stop selling the instant we leave the eu just because there are n't trade agreements in place which is basically what you imply . 
   and it will come with a long list of other regulations and restrictions that you will have to abide to in order to do trade with other markets beyond simple tariff free arrangements . 
  which is already a normal standard thing in international trade , even in the eu , but for some reason idiots like you do n't seem to understand that . 
  for example if a car headlight manufacturer in the usa or even any eu country wants to make a headlight for a british car that is legal to sell and use here it has to comply with british regulations . 
  that will be the other way around once we leave , taking over 1/8th of the eu 's current gdp with us .
