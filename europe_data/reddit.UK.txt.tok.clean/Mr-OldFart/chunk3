  i see three banks in the red in that chart . 
  til , thanks . 
   agreed but the difference between 5 % and 60 % is huge because one of the percentages is a percentage of export trade and the other percentage is a percentage of total trade . 
  you live in the south east do n't you ? 
  60 % of export trade which account for 10 % of all trade making around 6 % of all trade . 
  so both are correct . 
  trying to understand what stamp duty , a land tax , has to do with anything . 
   and given how the uk helped their allies in the last world war ... wow , just wow . 
  we sank everything we had into it from our empire knowing that it would result in the end of that empire . 
  the number of british dead in ww2 was equivalent to more than 10 % of your country 's population . 
  greece lost a piddling 35,000 troops compared to over 380,000 from the uk . 
  the british were n't just fighting on the western european front , we were in asia and africa too . 
  where were the greeks ? 
  oh that 's right , you shit yourselves and caved in in less than a month , rolled over and played good hotelier to the german forces . 
  even fucking bulgaria jointly occupied greece along with the italians , that 's how much of a contribution greece made . 
  britain on the other hand continued to withstand years of relentless bombing campaigns resulting in large parts of london being flattened and places like kingston upon hull seeing 95 % of all buildings with bomb damage all whilst fighting a war on three continents . 
  greece was a fucking joke before ww2 , was a joke throughout it and continues to be a joke . 
  before the eu existed my parents wanted to take up a job in belgium . 
  it took them just two weeks from applying for the job to getting the necessary visas to live and work in belgium . 
  this was in 1970 and it was low skilled . 
  are you telling me it would n't be possible in 2017 ? 
  both sides committed massive war crimes on the eastern front . 
  civilised behaviour basically deserted it . 
   but some people believe the myth that the empire was a civilizing force that brought education and industry to undeveloped parts of the world it did along with the bad stuff . 
  it is possible to do both things at the same time you know . 
  you even admit as much so how is it a myth ? 
  might be less , [ rotterdam effect . 
  ] ( http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uktrade/uk-trade/december-2014/sty-trade-rotterdam-effect-.html ), 
   find that we are no longer welcome in uk because we are `` foreigners '' rubbish . 
   and to add insult to injury we have uk ministers openly talking about using europeans living/working in uk as `` pawns in negotiations '' and coming up with idiotic ideas such as having companies make lists of `` foreigners '' working for them ( despite hmrc already having this data ) and the outrage this caused amongst the british public should be proof enough that your claim of no longer being welcome is bollocks . 
   in 2015 , 2.6 million first residence permits were issued in the european union ( eu ) to non-eu citizens , a record number since the data collection began ( 2008 ) and up by 12.1 % compared with 2014 . 
  this increase was mainly due to the higher number of first permits issued for employment reasons ( +23.5 % , from slightly less than 0.6 millionin 2014 to more than 0.7 million last year ) . 
  i 'm sorry but that must be a lie . 
  the remainers in the uk say it is impossible to get work in the eu if we leave . 
  tony [ `` if there is a change in the eu treaties i 'll have a referendum '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_constitution_referendum ) < change in treaty  `` but i did n't mean that kind of change '' blair not wanting us to leave the eu shocker . 
  the problem is that economic forecasts of doom and gloom just because of a leave vote being returned , let alone a50 being triggered were basically the entire campaign for remain . 
   it 's a tall order . 
  why is it a tall order ? 
  do you think we came to rule over 1/5th of the world and london has been the defacto world financial capital for the last 200 years only thanks to eu membership ? 
   i 've not heard a single really serious credible person say they want to actively hurt the uk . 
  [ francois hollande is n't credible ? 
  ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/5f84e4c4-8c17-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731 ) this is what he had to say 3 weeks ago ...  britain must suffer the consequences of leaving the eu in order to save the institution from an existential crisis , fran\u00e7ois hollande said on thursday . 
    speaking in paris at a dinner attended by jean-claude juncker , eu commission president , and michel barnier , the eu 's top brexit negotiator , the french president urged the bloc to lead tough negotiations with the uk to avoid contagion and protect the fundamental principles of the single market . 
    `` if not , we would jeopardise the fundamental principles of the eu . 
  other countries would want to leave the eu to get the supposed advantages without the obligations . ''   the socialist leader insisted : `` there must be a threat , there must be a risk , there must be a price . 
  otherwise we will be in a negotiation that can not end well . '', 
  it is quite funny that you say restricting freedom is bad yet support the eu which has employment laws which state that companies can only advertise jobs to people from outside of the eu once they 've exhausted the entire eu labour market and that the eu has massively damaging import tariffs on food from africa which keeps those countries populations poor . 
  very little because they export directly to mainland eu . 
  no idea if it does include financial services but given financial services between london and eu are a small portion of the total financial services carried out in the city , even if it was 100 % of them and we lost it all to frankfurt it would only mean around a 6-9 % drop in financial services revenue and therefore tax receipts of around # 9 - # 12bn , not the whole # 60bn claimed . 
  it was relevant to the comment i was replying to . 
   / u/mr-oldfart went the way his name implies and derped out some shitty comment about how / u/zicklein is scared about the cap . 
  no i did n't . 
  i said france is scared of anything which affects agriculture . 
  any remote threat to agriculture . 
  remember who benefits the most from cap ? 
  france . 
  you 're right , [ we account for just under 1/5th of total usa exports to the eu . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_united_states ) so there 's the fact we 're not exactly a small export market for them ( their 7th largest export market ) and the fact we 'd be able to come to an agreement far quicker than the eu seems able to . 
  40 years and the eu still does n't have a trade deal with the usa . 
   what makes you think the us wants to reward the uk with an expedited trade deal because they currently export more to the uk than the rest of the eu combined . 
   what i know i what is see : everything is getting more expensive already . 
  the only price rise i 've seen is petrol but given the price of crude has risen by over 10 % it is to be expected . 
  its opportunism . 
  already developed software has no physical costs to it . 
  2007 the exchange rate was # 1 = $ 2 and its funny how they did n't raise the prices by 1/3 in 2009 when the rate dropped to # 1 = $ 1.42 . 
   we have n't left so nothing has actually changed so why would prices ? 
  because of this ? 
   remember when the dollar hit $ 2 for # 1 ? 
  instead of spending # 1.50 on something if you spent $ 2 now you paid # 1 instead . 
  there is also the massive long list of things that we were told would happen in the immediate aftermath of a leave vote even before article 50 was triggered . 
   i ca n't even get a phone contract , cause i have no score in this country . 
  we do n't use credit scores in the uk . 
  whilst the credit reference agencies will give you a number , the lenders and mobile phone companies do n't look at it but instead look at your credit file , how much credit you already have , missed payments and defaults and have their own system to decide whether to lend you money or give you a phone contract . 
  the number is there just to give you an indication of how well or bad you 're doing . 
  other than that its pointless . 
  first of all you have just moved to the uk so are you registered on the electoral roll ? 
  if you are n't then you wo n't get credit from anyone in the uk because as far as they 're concerned you do n't exist if you 're not on the electoral roll . 
  you need to contact the local authority electoral officer and get put on . 
  next get over to / r/ukpersonalfinance and post on there . 
   because prices have n't altered just yet , just wait until the break up . 
  but remoaners have consistently said that the fall in the value of the gbp will result in prices going up . 
  the only thing i 've seen go up is the price of petrol by 5 % but given a barrel of crude has gone up 10 % in the last month it is n't unexpected . 
   some would say the world london is the de-facto world capital . 
   and it 's not entirely a domestic market . 
  neither is it entirely an eu market and in fact the eu business is a minority share of what banks in london deal with . 
  currently though its still buying the same amount of stuff that it did . 
   financial services is n't just the investment banks people love to hate , it 's insurance companies , retail banks , mortgage providers and pensions providers . 
  and not one of those require eu passporting and can continue to carry on as they have been doing if we do n't get it . 
  thank you for destroying your own argument . 
  still sat here waiting to feel any negative effects of all of this doom-mongering . 
  never had as much money in the bank , have done nearly as much work in the last 6 months as the entire previous year . 
  even if you wanted to convert my income and bank account to euros or usd i 'm still ahead of last year . 
  if 50 % or more of their trade is with the 65m one than the 485m one then yes , they would especially if that was to make trade even easier . 
   the uk surprised me being so low , pretty much everyone i know still live at home . 
  housing is unaffordable nowadays since house prices have shot up but wages have stagnated . 
  that is only really the case around london and the south east . 
  in much of the rest of the uk housing is affordable . 
  the city near me has houses for sale for under # 50,000 as do most towns/cities along the m62 corridor . 
   a lot of these people with their fuck london attitude are going to be in for a shock . 
  london has to remember that it is n't even remotely self sufficient .
