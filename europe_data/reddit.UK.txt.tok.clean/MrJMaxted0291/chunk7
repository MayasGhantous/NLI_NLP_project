  i imagine it would be a major injection for scotland 's economy if they suddenly saw 1,000,000 + people from england/wales immigrate in the space of a few years . 
  all that extra tax would go a long way to ensuring public services , while the influx of skilled labour would increase business competitiveness and reinforce the talent pool for things like the nhs . 
  only problem i can see in this sort of scenario is a major housing shortage if too many people choose scotland . 
  as for england , who knows what sort of effect a migration of this kind would have ? 
  if you take away a ton of skilled workers , their wealth , and the revenues from taxing these people combined with the other effects of brexit just how big a problem would it be ? 
  a major recession and breakdown of public services could be possible . 
  the eu membership argument was the decider in the 2014 campaign for sure . 
  it 's a shame we ca n't keep the country together considering 300 years of union , shared values etc , but if i were in your shoes i would 100 % vote to dissolve the uk if it meant eu membership . 
  on this subject actually , would it be possible for british citizens to apply to choose which country they want their citizenship based in once the separation occurs ? 
  i mean , the uk is one country , so when it splits you could argue individuals are free to choose which country they identify more with , as their status as `` british '' citizens would be defunct . 
  in theory this would be a great way to reconcile the 52/48 brexit vote split , with remainers free to choose citizenship in scotland , a country that will have eu citizenship , while the brexiteers keep england and go it alone . 
  imagine there 'd be a fairly severe brain drain to the north of the border under these circumstances . 
  granted , giving british citizens this kind of choice would be potentially disastrous . 
  it has mass migration written all over it , and odds are both england and scotland would be faced with crises if that much of the population displaced all at once . 
  if america really did pull out of nato it would likely galvanize european public opinion and fuel sentiment for further union . 
  at the very least it would bring the european army back on the agenda . 
   china and the us are far more insular and less connected to other regions of the world than europe is . 
  china i would mostly agree with you on , but the us ? 
  they 're just about the most interconnected country in the world at the moment . 
  for example , take a look at american naval activity in the pacific . 
  they have military bases all over the world , from japan to germany . 
  in the middle east , saudi arabia , and israel provide lily pads for american personnel . 
  just about the only region of the world america does n't have a significant military presence in is south africa , and they largely make up for this with the various ngos and business interests that operate in the region . 
  america acts as an arbiter across most regions it has a significant presence . 
  in the pacific it acts to balance japan , china and korea . 
  without the presence of the american navy , china and japan 's saber rattling over disputed territory in the south china sea could spill over into conflict as china tries to assert itself as a regional hegemon . 
  likewise , american military assets also help keep north korea contained . 
  meanwhile in europe , america 's role in nato ensures a bulwark against russia , keeping them in check . 
  it 's interesting to think about how much more audacious russia may have been if there was n't a significant nato force stationed in poland . 
  perhaps they may even try to dominate them as well as ukraine , who they were terrified were going to join the eu and break away from their sphere of influence . 
  long story short , america is far from insular . 
  should the us become isolationist overnight and pack up all those military bases all hell would break loose . 
   the people of europe are n't interested in power , or being a world power for that matter . 
  i feel like this is a fatal flaw in the european psyche , considering nothing can be achieved without power . 
  everything else you mentioned in your post ; jobs , healthcare , education , infrastructure and safety can be attained provided you have power . 
  without it , you ca n't have anything . 
   there 's no correlation between international power and those things i do n't know where you get this impression . 
  more international power grants the ability to secure better trade deals with other states , which has a direct correlation with the local economy , boosting jobs , healthcare , education and infrastructure . 
  international power gives you greater security in a variety of ways ; firstly , theres the obvious benefit of a large , well funded , advanced military with which to deter conflicts , ensure territorial integrity and win wars in the event deterence fails or foreign intervention becomes necessary . 
  secondly , it allows you to guide events on the world stage to the benefit of the state . 
  i feel like the idea of turning your back on power is a fundamentally dangerous one . 
  to relinquish power is to relinquish agency , as you can not guarantee anything without it . 
  to abandon power is to risk losing everything we have right now going into the future . 
  there is absolutely no guarantee states that do embrace more international power wo n't exploit us if we neglect our interests on an international level , in fact , it 's very likely that they 'll gladly do this to benefit their own interests . 
   china and india , both are as diverse as europe is . 
  i would n't say china is as diverse as europe . 
  you 've got the han chinese all over the heartland , then the 2 other significant minority groups are mongolian people along the northern periphery and tibetans further to the west . 
  compare that to the myriad different ethnicities peppered throughout europe and it 's dificult to draw a comparison between the two . 
  `` world region '' cool ... what 's that supposed to be ? 
  oceania , eurasia and eastasia from 1984 spring to mind . 
  i think ruling the world is an idea we europeans need to grow out of . 
  managing the world and guiding it in a positive direction though ? 
  that 's an idea worth working on , and something we can only achieve as a collective . 
  finland does n't exist . 
  your country is a sham !, 
  yeah i should have been clearer about that . 
  it was the flagship of the fleet . 
  for those who do n't really know about the hms victory it 's the ship that practically ensured superpower status for the british by establishing naval dominance for britain at the battle of trafalgar , where the british took on a numerically superior french-spanish fleet that outgunned them and utterly destroyed them without losing a single ship . 
  bean flag . 
   if the majority of brits is n't severely mentally challenged , they would n't swallow it , would they ? 
  i was telling myself the exact same thing in the run up to the referendum . 
  london was n't firebombed in ww1 . 
  france lost villages , it did n't get entire cities like caen reduced to rubble . 
  dresden was n't reduced to a scorched dead zone . 
  russia did n't lose over one ninth of their population . 
  i ca n't speak much for the situation for west and east germany , but the post war situation in the uk transformed society here . 
  the welfare state blossomed out of the misery of that war . 
  support for worker 's unions , civil rights , egalitarian values and nationalized industries ran in the national interest rose up in the post war order . 
  the conservatives that led us to victory in europe were rejected by the public in favour of labour , because labour offered a new vision for the future that was built around the idea of building a different , better country that would prevent suffering like that experienced during war times from ever happening again , where as churchill and the tories wanted to go back to the way things operated before . 
  the social climate that existed during and immediately after the second world war was one born of the hardship endured during the war , coupled with a sense of collectiveness that was fostered during this period to promote unity behind the war effort when the entire population was mobilized to fight fascism . 
  many people lost their homes , livelihoods , limbs and loved ones in the blitz or over in europe . 
  everyone was living day to day on rations . 
  women realized their place as the equal peers of men as they were rolled onto factory floors to produce bullets , bombs and uniforms for the men bleeding over in normandy . 
  when the war was over and the men came home , people realized that society had to change , and they made that change happen . 
  they turned their back on the men that had won them the war and embraced the ones who promised them change . 
  war widows got a safety net to ensure their children were fed . 
  maimed soldiers and their families got nhs care from cradle to grave . 
  ambitious council housing projects ensured the poor would have homes . 
  public ownership of services like public transport and regulations on corporate entities were implemented to curtail monopolies and tackle inequality . 
  one fifth of the economy was taken into government control . 
  at the end of the second world war , the british public had seen first hand how horrible the world could be . 
  they lived and breathed it for 5 years as they stood alone in europe . 
  after it was all over they had an appetite for change that culminated in the post war consensus , which amounted to sweeping social change on a scale that has n't been seen in this country before or since . 
  i know that us limeys once , as in the 17th century , rode into new amsterdam and renamed it new york . 
  pretty much the only thing anyone would need to know about the dutch if you 'd ask me . 
  * the united kingdom of great britain came into existence in 1707 with the [ acts of union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acts_of_union_1707 ) , which merged england and scotland into a single nation . 
  the two countries had shared the same monarch since 1603 , when [ james stuart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_vi_and_i ) inherited the english throne from [ elizabeth i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elizabeth_i_of_england ) , the last monarch of the tudor dynasty . 
  wales was already a part of england before this , having been capitulated during the [ edwardian conquest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conquest_of_wales_by_edward_i ) of 1283 , which marked the end of the rule of the welsh princes . 
  wales was formally [ integrated into england 's legal system in 1535 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_in_wales_acts_1535_and_1542 ) . 
  the uk 's territories in ireland were originally conquered in 1649 by [ oliver cromwell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oliver_cromwell ) , lord protector of britain during it 's brief period as a commonwealth following the [ english civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_civil_war ) . 
  a harsh rule was imposed on the irish , which left deep scars which exist to this day . 
  * the uk is home to the largest roman artefact found anywhere ; [ hadrian 's wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadrian%27s_wall ) . 
  hadrian 's wall was a 73 mile stone wall built by roman emperor [ hadrian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadrian ) that formed a barrier between northern england and the land beyond , which was inhabited by [ picts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/picts ) and [ celts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insular_celts ) . 
  the wall stretched between both the north sea and the irish sea , featured milecastles either side of the wall , and forts for every 5 miles . 
  when [ roman britain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_britain ) collapsed following the fall of the roman empire the wall was abandoned and gradually destroyed over time as it was weathered by nature and dismantled by people throughout the ages so the stone could be repurposed . 
  much of hadrian 's wall still exists to this day , a testament to the sheer scale of the fortification . 
  * [ the british empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_empire ) came into existence some time around the late 16th century during the [ age of discovery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_discovery ) and lasted until the mid 20th century . 
  at it 's pinnacle in 1920 , it was made up of nearly a quarter of the world 's landmass and is recognized as the largest empire in history . 
  the population of the empire at it 's height was over 412 million people from a wide range of cultural and ethnic backgrounds . 
  the british empire was the largest global power for over a century , and arguably the first global superpower .
