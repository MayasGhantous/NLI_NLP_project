  if it 's not incompetence it 's either malice or neglect that let the situation get to this stage . 
  besides that this can only be good news if it actually happens ( something i 'm not sure i have any great faith in ) . 
   the choice is n't between a ring-wing candidate , but between an incompetent one and one who is n't a month ago i 'd have been sure which was which but after keeping up with the media strategies i 'm not so certain anymore . 
  interesting mostly for demonstrating how misleading that can be . 
  good find !, 
  it would pretty much require the uk to actually break eu law in one of a few ways that is unlikely to happen . 
  article 7 was designed to be hard to invoke so it could n't be used as a threat during normal relations ( sensible because if it could be , it would be ) . 
  you should - most of our leaders would assume pok\u00e9mon is a terror group if you mentioned it to them . 
  i 'm a citizen of the world !, 
  ( except the many , many repressive bits - i 'll pretend those do n't exist . ), 
  does n't need to be offshore . 
  walls and fences are n't exactly expensive ( unless it 's the uk government building them ) . 
  did she have a press office ? 
  which is what i 'd like them to do until certain . 
  we had a police stabbing in leeds a few months ago that was very much not terrorism despite the initial knee jerk . 
  not even close . 
  yes because that 's exactly what i said . 
  in the case of the camps in the second boer war most of the deaths were due to disease and it may surprise you to learn quite how many of the guards died of the same diseases . 
  mismanagement is not the same as the systematic extermination of a race . 
  no wonder continental europe has an issue with holocaust deniers . 
  in fact it 's worse than you say - the eu has n't been able to agree it 's wto obligations/agreements since 2004 ( i think it was ) and is still running off it 's 15 member set . 
  as the uk will have to disentangle it 's parts of an obligation/agreement set that does n't currently exist the uk will probably have to exist outside of even the wto framework for quite a while . 
  * sigh * bad history strikes again . 
  the british have not `` basically invented the concentration camp '' in the modern meaning of the word i.e. 
  synonymous with death camp . 
  the british named their internment camps concentration camps . 
  i do n't know how old you think the uk is as a country but we did n't invent internment camps . 
  same reason there wont be a meaningful brexit agreement ( and the same reason the eu is utterly terrible at making trade agreements ) - need to get 28 nations to agree . 
  might be - been a few attempts on soldiers lately which is why kidnapping is suspected . 
  it may end up being a big misunderstand or it may end up as another demonstration of how peaceful islam is . 
  let 's hope for the former . 
  to be fair this guy is just a self hating brit . 
   ooohh i said it this is basically a troll account so we expect you to say things like this . 
  i 'd expect a dog to piss on a lamp post and i expect you to shitpost . 
  switzerland propose [ legislation prioritising swiss nationals for jobs ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/abb3de84-832c-11e6-8897-2359a58ac7a5 ) and / r/europe reacts . 
  ` well that 's not great ' the uk does it . 
  ` literally hitler - when do the armbands get introduced \\* ' \\* three times in this thread and counting [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55yvy4/uk_firms_must_list_foreign_workers/d8euy7m?st=itwxx7iz&amp;sh=bd6a9948 ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55yvy4/uk_firms_must_list_foreign_workers/d8ewhb6?st=itwxy4al&amp;sh=052820a6 ) [ 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55yvy4/uk_firms_must_list_foreign_workers/d8exiwy?st=itwxyqns&amp;sh=f37d4121 ), 
  that 's pretty impressive - 0 to full circlejerk while proving godwin 's law . 
  edit : ahh / r/europe do n't ever change . 
  literally hitler for what amounts to ` firms sponsoring work visas to be required to show that hiring outside uk is necessary ' . 
   it did n't help that i had credit with them ( due to them overcharging , and from returns ) and then in a space of week my pound could buy me less :( that sounds shite . 
  we 've got really lucky this year - booked a holiday to thailand the night before the brexit vote when the pound strengthened on remain predictions and got it at the price before the pound tanked . 
  purchased the holiday money the day before may 's announcement scared the market again . 
  i would n't argue against a statue of hitler in berlin being preserved ( irrelevant as that is considering none were ) . 
  i would argue against the commissioning of a new one , though . 
  well for a more relevant example ( as hitler would be an odd statue to put in london ) we do have [ statues of oliver cromwell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statue_of_oliver_cromwell,_westminster ) and he was an absolute monster and there has been a lively debate surrounding it . 
  edit : this reminds me so thank you reddit - there was a fantastic statue in cyprus of a guy with a book under one arm and a submachine gun in the other . 
  going to try to find out what that was about . 
  i think that may be what he means , actually . 
  no need to exaggerate . 
  she was 7 and as a man of principle he did n't consummate the marriage until she turned 9 . 
  i probably would as i prefer not to censor history too much . 
  just make sure the plaque makes clear they are n't an example to follow . 
  unless they are irish then they are quietly forgotten about outside of ireland . 
  and i understand your point of view . 
  i 'd actually share it if i thought the eu could find a solution to it 's current issue with wealth and capital movement that are draining certain parts of europe ( the uk was one of the beneficiaries of this ) . 
  but i think that 's going to blow up before it 's fixed . 
  i wonder how big a part relative optimism about the eu 's future played in the vote . 
  still my favourite book nearly two decades after i first read it . 
  oh this bit of bad history again . 
  i assume you are referring to the camps set up in the second boer war ? 
  if not i apologise but i 'm going to continue on the assumption you are . 
  the concentration camps set up by the british empire in the second boer war were holding camps and not really comparable to the camps set up in nazi germany which had the aim of exterminating the inmates . 
  the only thing special about them was the name . 
  you will find similar internment camps littered throughout history . 
  just from a practical standpoint most large businesses are n't the slick profit making machines a lot of people on reddit imagine - even if that was the intention they tend to be plodding things run by people who just want to go home and be done with the work day . 
  not raping everything would be sloppy . 
  who wants to do half a job ? 
  must admit it was an odd decision for a german to raise national misbehaviour involving camps . 
  northern ireland runs a consistent deficit of around 10bn a year ( [ this is a couple of years old ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/northern-ireland-is-officially-one-of-uks-costliest-regions-as-fiscal-deficit-hits-9bn-30152040.html ) ) while with the eu according to this article it 's [ 3.5 bn over 7 years ] ( http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/business/where-do-eu-grants-to-northern-ireland-go-1-7233873 ) . 
  so uk balance shift is about 1920 % that of the eu . 
  edit : to put it in perspective , because of the massive policing costs northern ireland runs a larger budget deficit than the republic of ireland . 
  but again that would settle along party lines with absolutely no guarantee that it would be even close to representative of the wishes of the populace . 
  it 's great if you want a rubber stamp but crap if you actually care about democratic representation . 
  would also be warped by mp selection in first past the post systems and party favour trading in pr systems . 
  i agree that we need immigration ( we badly need skilled immigration , anyway , few countries need unskilled immigration ) but on the scale we 've been experiencing it ? 
  it 's irresponsible to say the least as with this level of influx , integration is simple not practical . 
  that 's completely ignoring the infrastructure and housing issues it causes . 
  there is nothing wrong with putting a number to it , the issue is the number being arbitrary . 
  to be fair i 'd expect a number of rough years after the exit and i 'm a leaver . 
  it 's the longer term i 'm optimistic about . 
   the point of representative democracy is that the concerns can be addressed this is a point that representative democracy has been utterly failing at in the uk for as long as i 've been voting . 
  immigration as an issue has been lied about by our main parties for long enough that an entirely toxic situation have built up around it . 
  there are other issues but that 's the killer . 
  the one that used to be there . 
  the one that raids by the ira were conducted across that lead to the border posts being built a mile + from the border to minimise exposure . 
  northern ireland is more heavily subsidised by the rest of the uk than it is by the eu . 
  not by a small margin either . 
  i 'd look on the bright side with this one - all sides are making the right noises . 
  also we do n't get the cross border raids any more so currently they would serve no purpose . 
  hmm if only we 'd used this kind of argument with the scottish referendum and thus not held it . . no wait , that would be a terrible idea . 
  so you would think a number of referendums with an end result ? 
  or a referendum with a required majority to pass ? 
  either way a referendum ( or series of ) is still a much better vehicle to deliver a democratically representative result . 
  talk of political inertia still would n't make representative democracy any more capable of providing any serious kind of democratic representation on an issue like this . 
  it would work perfectly if people only voted in an election based on one issue * and * if new parties did n't more or less require the backing of rich donors that are unsubtly hostile to change to ever be in a position to shape policy . 
  vastly better . 
  though the similarity is there ; a larger political block enforcing a very negative situation for the sake of expediency . 
  agreed ; the french one looks oddly high for a country with very solid social safety nets . 
  that assumes i believe the eu will still be a thing in 30 years time .
