  only stuff that seems to end up on this sub is torygraph ( which hates the eu ) and the shartian ( which hates the united kingdom ) . 
  it 's quite depressing . 
  is abortion covered under human rights ? 
  it 's a pretty contentious issue in most nations . 
  this person disagrees with me but is adding his view to the conversation . 
  i must downvote him immediately . 
  come on , guys , stop being shit . 
  if a tree falls in the forest and there 's nobody there to hear it , do we blame muslims/brexit ? 
  nobody has any idea - currently we have a government without policies . 
  err it 's about ten to one . 
  in the last three decades our conservatives have been prone to opposing free markets whenever it would benefit their many wealthy friends , our labour party engaged in a spree of privatisation and removed significant amounts of state funding for higher education . 
  wiki labels only tell a small part of the story . 
  the lib dems flip and flop on positions depending on what day of the week it is and what the other parties are saying . 
  lib dems manage half of that some of the time . 
  i think you are unfamiliar with the british lib dems , sadly . 
   supporting conservative economic policies but having liberal views in social matters . 
  can we have her after you guys are done with her ? 
  i do n't think what we 've seen would compare to what we 'd see if our government just ignored the referendum result . 
  there are two directions for the eu , looser or tighter . 
  both are valid ( and would arguably solve many of it 's issues ) and both come with their own challenges . 
  the author of this guardian piece paints the ` looser ' position as subversion leaving only total federal europe as the correct course of action . 
  reality is not that simple . 
  you got the article behind the paywall to paste in here ? 
  sadly that 's the only way to get shit done in half the world . 
  moderate to poor . 
  know a belarusian girl who lives/works in london and sends money home - she had a nightmare with immigration here though , for quite a long time . 
  i just mean with the frequency democracies have been flipped by outside forces in the last century and how far the science of population control has advanced . 
  we are * seriously * good at subverting the actions of our fellow man at this point . 
  but good point anyway - i can see where it 's coming from . 
  what does the uk not having a static constitution have to do with the use of an advisory referendum ? 
  which is a terrible saying . 
  countries do not exist in a vacuum . 
  not to mention cause some serious social friction . 
  in fact i 'd say it played a large part in the leave vote so may well have caused brexit . 
  indeed - the referendum is making absolutely sure that everybody is aware if the eu does try to push migrant quotas it 's directly against the wishes of the hungarian people . 
  it removes any ambiguity that to do so would be exceptionally undemocratic . 
   on the other hand most national welfare policies are far more ambitious than the uk which welfare policies are you talking about specifically ? 
  reading this subreddit would give you a very stilted view of the uk so do n't put too much stock in the impression you get from here . 
  i used the word ` much ' because it 's accurate - the uk currently significantly exceeds the eu minimums so the idea that we have the conditions we have because of the eu is just inaccurate . 
  in the run up to the referendum certain papers were spamming the idea that the eu protects uk maternity leave while current comparisons put the uk at one of the most generous . 
  ( address has brackets in it so ca n't shorten link ) http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/atag/2014/545695/eprs_ata ( 2014 ) 545695_rev1_en . pdf basically the only area we do n't exceed the eu minimum is paid annual leave but most jobs offer more than the minimum 28 days anyway . 
  edit : sorry i 'm wrong - the eu mandates 20 days and we get minimum 28 . 
  it 's also not true - the uk 's worker protections are much stronger than what the eu mandates . 
  / r/tamernak has an issue with the uk and likes to lie about it . 
  edit : he likes to shitpost about the uk but [ quickly deletes his posts if they prove unpopular . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55eq02/all_eu_laws_will_transfer_into_british_law_with/d8a15fy?st=itslv3fh&amp;sh=1d7edee4 ) . 
  so take anything he says with a handful of salt . 
  they are weaker than france but much stronger than most of europe . 
  certainly much stronger than the eu mandates in most areas . 
  wow his post history is hilarious !, 
  another / r/europe poster that has turned hating the uk into a hobby . 
  yesss let the butthurt flow through you . 
  so scotland has n't had more powers devolved to it ? 
  we 've all been misinformed . 
  cool . 
  guess that 'll save quite a bit of money when we sell off the scottish parliament building , right ? 
  enjoy your hate wank . 
  ireland may not have but plenty of irish people did . 
  you 're on / r/europe while it 's having a hate wank . 
  do n't expect reality to come into it . 
  i get told this every time on / r/europe but the polls never seem to reflect it . 
  folks round here have a massive hard-on for the idea of breaking up the uk . 
  there was n't an ` english choice ' or ` scottish choice ' . 
  there was a uk choice which voted 52 % to leave the eu . 
  the majority of my household voted remain ( though i did not ) but that 's also irrelevant . 
  not so much - normandy and aquitaine stood out from the crowd as separate powers with separate pretty much everything . 
  the king of france had remarkably little power during the 1060 's - in fact it was only a few years before 1066 when the king of france tried invading normandy and lost , if i recall correctly . 
  different culture , different language , different laws , different currency , different foreign policy and trying to invade each other . 
  sound like rivals to me . 
  edit : just checked the wiki and the king of france unsuccessfully tried invading normandy twice in the 1050 's !, 
  it was even more fractious than i thought . 
  pretty much !, 
  that time period in europe absolutely fascinates me . 
   [ rollo of normandy was the chief -- the `` jarl '' -- of the viking population . 
  after 911 , he was the count of rouen . 
  his successors gained the title duke of normandy from richard ii . 
  after the rise of the capetian dynasty , they were forced to vacate the title , for there could be only one duke in neustria , and the robertians carried the title . 
  these dukes increased the strength of normandy , although they had to observe the superiority of the king of france . 
  the dukes of normandy did not resist the general trend of monopolizing authority over their territory : the dukes struck their own money , rendered justice , and levied taxes . 
  they raised their own armies and named the bulk of prelates of their archdiocese . 
  they were therefore practically independent of the french king , although they paid homage to each new monarch . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_normandy#ducal_normandy_.2810th_to_13th_centuries.29 ) the history of normandy appears to disagree with you . 
  normandy remained a fairly separate entity for a couple of hundred years after that too . 
  it was a reworking of the titlegore here . 
   a russian furniture company starts selling a children 's bed that imitates buk-m1 , the type of launcher that brought down flight mh-17 over ukraine easily becomes  a british furniture company starts selling a children 's bed that imitates a tiger , the type of tank that played a role in hitler 's conquests in europe . 
  and rightfully sounds absurd . 
  the buk is a pretty iconic bit of kit up there with the scud , smerch and abrams visually . 
  see this is strange to me because in all of my travels i 've not encountered a sausage that rivals the lincolnshire sausage . 
  not everything has to be smoked . 
  kinda - france was a separate kingdom from normandy ( different ethnicity , similar language but with big dialectic differences and rather different culture ) so calling modern france the successor to normandy is pushing it . 
  the events around the norman conquest of england are basically a viking-off ( like a dance off but violent and with vikings ) ; the saxons ( anglicised vikings ) had a battle with norwegians ( original recipe vikings ) and won before being defeated by the normans ( frenchified vikings ) . 
  it annoys the shit out of me and i 'm * british * . 
  my niece 's bed was n't a reference to the second world war . 
  i very much doubt this bed is a reference to anything more than a military vehicle for a child that enthuses about such things . 
  it 's not making money out of tragedy , the buk was around quite a while before mh-17 went down . 
  here 's a [ tank ] ( http://\u043c\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\u043c.\u0440\u0444/krovati-originalnye/krovat-tank-patriot ) one and here 's an [ artillery ] ( http://\u043c\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\u043c.\u0440\u0444/krovati-originalnye/krovat-tank ) one . 
  here 's an [ american shop with similar stuff ] ( http://boysthemebedrooms.com/army/military-camouflage-bedrooms-army-theme-beds.html ) including [ carpet bombing wall decals ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/41p03r3tsal.jpg ) . 
  blood russians having army themed kids stuff like we do in the west !, 
  where do they get off ? 
  one of my nieces ( my favourite niece ) had a little tank bed , the type of vehicle used by hitler 's army to conquer france !, 
  seriously this is a kids novelty bed - what 's the problem ?
