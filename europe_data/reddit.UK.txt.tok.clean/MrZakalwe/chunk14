  one is a whole world better than zero . 
  some very basic arrangement may be possible . 
  original post edited . 
  do you know of an example of them negotiating any kind of international arrangement within two years ? 
  do you know of an example of them negotiating any kind of international arrangement within two years ? 
  i know of no example of the eu negotiating * anything * within two years . 
  you could n't get a breakfast menu through the commission , council and parliament in that time . 
  it 's going to be a hard brexit and all that entails for everybody . 
  article 50 was never written to be functional ( as the guy who wrote it has said ) and we are all , to different degrees , going to pay the price for that hubris . 
  edit : as has been pointed out i 'm wrong - the turkey refugee agreement was made in less than two years . 
  there is now an example . 
  there may be hope . 
  i would assume his plan did n't get support - he 's the german finance minister so would not be able to do anything like that on his own . 
  so far i 'm the only one out of the two of us to actually back up anything they 've typed . 
  original post  you remember this is the same guy who was trying to get greece forcibly ejected from the eu whatever they did , right ? 
  your claim  if he was then greece would n't be in the eu anymore . 
  so yeah , you are wrong on that one . 
  your claim is contracticted by yanis varoufakis and tim geithner ( i.e. 
  they allege he was trying ) . 
  do you have anything to dispute this or are you just typing bullshit, 
  german posturing in response to ^ british ^ posturing ^ in ^ response ^ to ^ ^ commission ^ ^ posturing ^ ^ in ^ ^ response ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ british ^ ^ ^ posturing ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ response ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ french ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ posturing ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ response ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to, 
  it 's that or you are just typing bullshit . 
  i 'm an optimist . 
  in this case the uk had no was of ` blocking ' the inquiry as it does not require unanimous support . 
  do n't believe everything the guardian tells you . 
  yup whenever the uk does get a contract we are normally bidding against french and german firms . 
  yeah there 's a lot of controversy here about the involvement of our arms industry . 
  probably less reported in other countries because of the lack of indirect involvement . 
  was all over the bbc when the conflict was younger . 
  [ a bit more info for you ] ( https://www.thepressproject.gr/details_en.php?aid=61869 ) but the geithner quotes come from his book [ stress test ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/b00in87xwe/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=utf8&amp;btkr=1 ) and the whole thing is n't ambiguous . 
  geithner and varoufakis both allege the same thing . 
  so they would have to be both lying . 
  do you think they are both lying ? 
  now that 's he 's not trying to destroy greece to send a message and `` scare other countries in to line '' . 
  err yeah that 's the sentence explaining why sch\u00e4uble wished to force greece from the eu . 
  i highlighted it because scaring nations in to line is a wonderfully tyrannical intention . 
  the sentence i quoted is saying that geithner confirmed varoufakis 's remarks . 
  i 'll quote it again to help you . 
   this was confirmed by former us treasury secretary tim geithner in early 2014 what secret source of information do you have that means you know better than tim geithner and yanis varoufakis about the inner workings of eu politics at that time ? 
  well it 's the guardian so you should expect this but the article does n't actually seem match the headline - [ the open letter ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/22/urgent-need-international-inquiry-yemen ) calls for an inquiry but the blocking claim is n't backed by anything i can find . 
  i can find references to the uk not supporting it but it does n't require unanimous approval . 
  edit : [ polly truscott ] ( https://twitter.com/pollyinthecity?ref_src=twsrc%5egoogle%7ctwcamp%5eserp%7ctwgr%5eauthor ) does n't seem to say what she does in the article either - looks like they took two separate partial quotes and put them next to each other to create the impression of a new quote . 
  can i have the pre snowden guardian back ? 
  it was a world class paper rather than this clickbait shite . 
  not that i can find . 
  trying to find which organisations are accusing anybody of anything because the open letter released on friday does n't seem to at a quick scan - seems to be just saying something needs to be done . 
   this was confirmed by former us treasury secretary tim geithner in early 2014 so it would have to be both of them lying . 
  so tim geithner and yanis varoufakis were lying ? 
   at least till an attempt to educate him fails people have been trying for 30 years . 
  fortunately for everybody he does not have the supreme executive power within the eu you seem to think he does . 
  to quote from his wiki  sch\u00e4uble came under criticism for his actions during the `` grexit '' crisis of 2015 : it was suggested by yanis varoufakis that sch\u00e4uble had intended to force greece out of the euro even before the election of the left-wing syriza government in greece . 
  [ 76 ] this was confirmed by former us treasury secretary tim geithner in early 2014 ; calling sch\u00e4uble 's plan `` frightening , '' ** geithner recorded that sch\u00e4uble believed a greek exit from the eurozone would scare other countries in to line . 
  [ 77 ] ** the guy is a would be despot . 
  but hey he argued with somebody you do n't like so he ca n't be scum , surely ? 
  here 's hoping . 
   i will cut my nose to spite my face that 's actually the story of most brexit stories from both sides . 
  with any luck most of it 's just posturing . 
  you remember this is the same guy who was trying to get greece forcibly ejected from the eu whatever they did , right ? 
  who also used gas . 
  both sides have used gas at this stage . 
  things continue with current trend you 'll just have assad . 
  not all interventions have the same pr outcome - sierra leone is used as an example of an intervention done right . 
  bosnia is also looked upon favourably . 
  in the case of syria it 's mostly saudi arabia and turkey supplying the weapons but yeah we kinda are to blame for iraq . 
  unless you seriously think we did n't destabilise it when we invaded it , bombed the shit out of it 's infrastructure , and removed most of it 's government ? 
  that assumes the opposition would all play nice . 
  fsa , isis , and al nusra coalition government ? 
  xenos spotted ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ too ^ ^ much ^ ^ dawn ^ ^ of ^ ^ war . 
  ahh sweet irony . 
  a casually racist accusation of casual racism . 
  sweden yes !, 
  it was in an area where the largest ethnic group is bangladeshi muslim . 
  the guardian would not tiptoe around blaming somebody of white british ethnicity . 
  it 's the guardian , dude . 
  most of the cctv is privately owned and covers a business . 
  in this case it would be kinda like that but replace fighting with sponging . 
  please do n't be british , please do n't be ... fuck . 
  i would watch that !, 
  it would be like an incredibly petty version of the film falling down . 
  no requirement for it to be an island . 
  walls work just fine . 
  it 's a common attitude in this sub that certain contentious things should be imposed on people for their own good . 
  1.5 tons of arts and crafts aids . 
  why , god , why ? 
  because the initial story was pretty funny , the local responses were pretty funny and now we 've got a followup that 's also somewhat funny . 
  aint nobody wants to miss this !, 
  this story just gets better and better !, 
  it could be done but it would take time . 
  on the bright side it would n't need to be done in the very short time frame finland had - your border issue was a crisis response while this would be a longer term policy change . 
  in practice it does n't matter as it wont happen . 
  this is n't a brexit thread . 
  keep it that way . 
  it does n't fit the multicultural ideal - integration is the enemy , remember ? 
  that would be glorious democratic people 's republic of korea . 
  as you well know . 
  i 'd agree but that increase is to be expected . 
  now compare it with ireland , netherlands , united kingdom , or finland . 
  different enough that there are urban centres with no semi-ghettos/ghettos ? 
  industry , history , and policy are mostly irrelevant when talking about the existence of racial ghettos and the only way to avoid them is a very strict immigration policy that nobody in western europe pursues . 
   ok erik i 've double checked and this * is * the place !,
