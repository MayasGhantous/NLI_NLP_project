  then they 'll make unaccaptable demands during the brexit negociation and will blame the eu even more when they get no deal at all . 
  so far expectations have been set incredibly low by the government in recent months . 
  it just does n't match the rhetoric coming out of the actual government ( rather than random commentators grabbed by the daily mail )  after that , they 'll go beg big daddy murica for a special trade deal that 's going completly fuck their economy let 's wait and see - being open to the eu markets was n't exactly death for us so why should we expect being open to the us market to do it ? 
  canada seemed to manage . 
  which is a retarded point until ...  but they 'll be able to brag that now they rule again over the world , together , with the usa . 
  yeah . 
  cool . 
  he went full retard . 
  only europeans seem to think brits dream of empire - we barely learn about it in school and most of us were n't alive to see it ; most brits know about the british empire in only the vaguest of terms . 
  i know why folks post it because it gets easy upvotes in an / r/europe hatewank but the point is bullshit . 
   what a petty nation it became . 
  how am i supposed to respond to namecalling ? 
  i doubt he even understands the irony of finishing a petty post like that . 
  nah plenty of british national arrogance over the years to inspire dislike ( which is quite similar to german national arrogance or french national arrogance ) . 
  in this sub i think it was mostly that the british are more vocally eurosceptic and this is a zealously pro eu sub . 
  nah the uk got the hate long before brexit but back then we had to share it with romania . 
  now we get to keep it all to ourselves ( unless trump continues to muscle in on our turf , then we 'll have to share again ) . 
  retirement . 
  folks do n't go there to work for the most part . 
  he heh heh come to / r/europe for the brit-hate stay for the ... what else you got ? 
  edit : ok found something else - lots of gypsy hate here too . 
  depends if you ask / r/unitedkingdom, 
  is trump a person ? 
  steady now ... 
  `` person wishes thing they do n't like would stop '', 
  they do n't like you asking questions like that . 
  gets uncomfortable . 
  you should also not compare us citizen ppp to eu citizen ppp . 
  the vote of a scotsman is worth exactly the same as the vote of an englishman or a welshman . 
  it 's called being treated fairly . 
  are you seriously crying because scotsmen are n't treated as vastly more important than welshmen ? 
  i agree . 
  but get past the idea the scots are being held at gun point . 
  they were asked if they want to leave the uk and said no . 
  i doubt a vocal minority will ask again soon and i 'll wait to hear the answer . 
  if they want to leave they are free to go . 
  other nations within the eu do not have quite such an enlightened attitude . 
   no you, 
  butthurt and triggered accusations . 
  is this / r/the _ donald now ? 
  they only store data on under 18s . 
  the whole stat is about under 18s . 
  you think there will be significant debt relief ? 
  the report was assuming that the next bailout payment would be made ( which is what you are talking about ) but when did debt relief become a serious possibility ?

   also chocolate and frozen cake can be deadly at high speed xd if the brexit projections were accurate the uk military may soon have to rely on this . 
  if they can afford cake .

  too late .

  the intention was that non abusive genital piercings would not be recorded but the guidance given to health professionals was to report all genital piercings . 
  i have linked the government guidance . 
  all female genital piercings are reported as fgm . 
  edit : sorry dude this post probably came across as more dismissive than it was meant to - the non-reporting thing was quietly dropped before it was actually implemented and as nobody made a song and dance about it almost nobody knew - i would n't know if i did n't have a friend who was working in hr law at the time and like to rant about stuff like this normally ending with ` fucking tories ' . 
  the uk government , depressingly . 
  i think sweden do it as well . 
  even though they face heavy criticism and opposition from charities and advocacy groups at the time they just decided to carry on . 
  who pretended that ? 
  i 'm just saying the headline is clickbait . 
  it 's no coincidence that the recorded level of fgm dramatically increased when we started recording things that are n't fgm as fgm . 
  crazy , huh ? 
  that was a neat evasion . 
  i almost did n't see it . 
  are you seriously equating clit piercing with fgm ? 
  and without an abusive context . 
  edit : literally every female genital piercing is now recorded as fgm and has for several years . 
  this coincided ( purely coincidentally ) with a massive rise in the recorded levels of fgm . 
  when you start counting cats and lions as lions do n't be surprised if your records see a massive increase in lions . 
  not ` not a problem ' but the headline is clickbait . 
  clit piercing is hardly the greatest evil our society will face . 
  well holy shit . 
  i googled that assuming it was n't true and it turns out it is . 
  before you jump to too strong a conclusion from this it should be noted that it includes all forms of female genital piercing as fgm . 
  numbers are misleading . 
  edit : somebody is saying that it 's only ` abusive piercings ' but here 's [ the government guidelines given to heath professionals ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/525405/fgm_mandatory_reporting_map_a.pdf ) and they very clearly do not differentiate ( also includes tattoos ) . 
  albeit probably not for long . 
  financial forecasting gets less accurate the further into the future you go , not more . 
  what 's really depressing was watching cameron try to paint his dealings as a success . 
  ' i know we asked for very little and did n't get it but merkel left me some of her fries and they were n't completely cold !, 
  oh yes we have !, 
  it 's too late - i 've resigned myself to the life of a shandy drinking southern nancy in the north of england .

  ~ ~ will try and find a piece on a us state when they introduced freeway speed limits and road deaths increased significantly . ~ ~ ~ ~ from that it looked like if you have speed limits lower is better but not having them at all for freeways was pretty comparable to lower limits . ~ ~ ~ ~ of course i might have dreamt it as i ca n't for the life of me find it now . ~ ~ ca n't find it so ignore comment . 
  anybody standing between pence and power has a certain amount of good in them . 
  which group does he have an irrational hatred of ? 
  what 's the value of a life when the alternative appears to have no upsides even theoretical ? 
  boring answer but i 'd guess terrible record keeping . 
  if they are using vehicle registrations to count the vehicles and nobody registers them ... 
  either way looks like it puts the afghanistan war to shame for casualties !, 
  also holy shit brazil !, 
  i was comparing similar developed nations with similar road networks . 
  i did n't pick at random ( i 'd probably have grabbed thailand if i was doing that as those guys take road collateral damage * seriously * ) . 
  it 's sadly an area without much significant study and i 'm struggling to find the work done by a guy called j. j. leeming who actually bothered to do some . 
  edit : here 's [ the book ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/road-accidents-prevent-j-j-leeming/dp/1897856296 ) but there used to be in the google library . 
  seems to have vanished .
