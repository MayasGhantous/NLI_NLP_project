  the man has tried and failed to become an mp no less than 8 times if memory serve me correctly . 
  did n't he also lose to al murray , the pub landlord . 
  a * fictional character * ? 
  also , the bnp is pretty much dead and gone . 
  but all its members are now members of britian first ... which also shares most of its membership with ukip . 
   also : if something is to be sold in the eu , it has to follow eu standards . 
  so it is not like many of your products make it through anyway . 
   * something something * ttip * something something *, 
  i try to buy uk/eu products as a rule anyway , so yes ? 
  i ca n't say i 've ever seen any hate for wanting to travel . 
  that said , saying `` i love to tavel '' is a pretty vague statement and might illicit some eye rolls in a dating profile . 
  it 's like `` i like films '' or `` i like pumping oxygenated blood around my body '' , yes , everyone does . 
  no really . 
  the elections in the uk are `` better '' and our system is * rubbish * . 
  the electoral colleges for one ... 
   i 've heard that the police can go to your house if you made an offensive post in social media such as facebook and twitter ? 
  is this true ? 
  yes and no . 
  in the uk * any public forum * is considered equal - be it a facebook status update or just shouting it in the street - so is subject to the same laws . 
  harassment and incitement to violence do n't become less harassing and inciting when they 're on twitter . 
  that said you wo n't be arrested for `` offensive '' posts , unless it 's part of a targeted campaign against an individual , or calling for a violent act to happen . 
   if so , how does that affect your posts on reddit ? 
  it does n't . 
  because i do n't harass people or call for violence . 
  it 's not a hard law to stay on the right side of . 
   i should change the title to : * how is free speech in countries under the european union ? 
  * `` countries * of * the european union '' . 
  ` under ' makes it sound like you think the eu is some overriding oppressive force . 
  also the source you posted is quite a hard line right wing one . 
  so they might have * a little * bias . 
   `` what to do , when a ship carrying a hundred passengers suddenly capsizes and there is only one lifeboat ? 
  when the lifeboat is full , those who hate life will try to load it with more people and sink the lot . 
  those who love and respect life will take the ship 's axe and sever the extra hands that cling to the sides '' quick tip , if the ship is * upside down * it could have a million lifeboats , but they 're also upside down and * above you * . 
  so please stop cutting people 's hands off . 
  apple pie in the uk is great , but polish apple ~ ~ pie ~ ~ cake is next level . 
  maybe you guys should eat more . 
  sauerkraut is good . 
   i have questions for the government as to ** why they were placed here of all places ** ( small city in northern ireland , serious social housing shortage , high unemployment and economically depressed ) , as i do n't think in the long term this is the best place for them . 
  because our current government does n't give two fucks about poor people ( of any nationality ) and would quite like it if they all gathered in once place and did n't make too much noise or lower property values . 
   ( except economy ) . 
  usually a * pretty big * factor that affects most people . 
  i 'm moving within the * same country * and it 's proving to be a hassle , i ca n't imagine what it 's like for someone from outside of the country ( language issues aside ) . 
  unless you 're some kind of software engineer/market trader/translator wunderkind , most places wo n't give you the time of day for an interview until you 're * at least * in the same time zone . 
  my theory is that they 're waiting until the eu changes its name then they can say `` uh oh !, 
  we said we 'd leave * the eu * , not * the union of europe * . 
  soz guys , no more brexit . '', 
  * welcome to politics !, 
  how are you for juwels ? 
  lactofree milk is in a tetra pack , as is all the fancy ` not milk ' milks and the somewhat fancy ` milk ' milks . 
  also all the uht milk is in tetra packs . 
  it 's fairly common , you ca n't have not seen tetra pack milk . 
  sainsburys tried to push the whole bagged milk thing a couple of years ago . 
  you brought a single refillable container and topped it up with the bags ( like what 's becoming popular with coffee ) . 
  they discontinued it sadly , i quite liked it . 
  plus tetra packs are a pain ... 
  too far lad, 
  no sex please , we 're british . 
  bake off . 
  bake off is life . 
  almost 1/3 of the county watches it . 
   the soldier next to her is like : `` so proud of my queen '' * cries for deep emotions * he 's thinking this about the gun , he has n't noticed the bird firing it . 
  ^ ^ ^ * pssst * that guy is lying to you . 
  you can order a `` black coffee '' ( sometimes called a `` filter coffee '' ) pretty much * anywhere * . 
  hell , even maccas sells them . 
  we 're not all coffee hipsters with fancy wank coffees ^ ^ ^ ignore ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ soy ^ ^ ^ vanilla ^ ^ ^ latte . 
  i still own my phone , so no . 
  even surprised me , a brit . 
  it 's not even `` only cards '' , it 's `` only contactless '' . 
  no , but we should have it . 
  if we have the right to live , we should have the right to die .

  that 's twice you 've argued this , without producing any evidence . 
  i 'm starting to think that , maybe , your flair is a lie . 
  it 's the pedal between the accelerator and the clutch . 
  i 'm lead to belive that german cars have them also ( dispite all evidence to the contrary ) . 
  or when they tour american desserts . 
   i believe the hairy women / people who do n't bath stereotype comes from the fact that when us troops landed french people had been severaly rationed on many basic products , including most hygiene products for about four years . 
  given that the us serotype of british food being boiled shit comes from the same time , i 'm inclined to believe this . 
  it 's odd that such a modern country has n't updated their serotypes in over 70 years ... 
  excuse me sir , are these ( . 
  a pair of breasts or a mountain range ? 
  ( just from tv and reddit ) it seems that bullying in america is almost tribal , in that it 's the jocks v the nerds . 
  whereas over here there 's usually a handful of `` bullies '' ( usually kids with social problems and a homelife similar to the thunderdome ) who pick on anyone they see as weaker than themselves . 
  my generation ( born in the mid eighties ) finished their schooling just as the country was pulled into a massive economic recession . 
  so , i 've noticed , we do n't have the same ` optimistic ' mindset that previous and the following generations did and do . 
  we , quite quickly , went from being told `` find the job of your dreams ! '', 
  to `` find any job '' . 
  even now , dispite brexit , the job market ( and economy ) is doing a bit better people i know - myself included - would rather stay in a job that they do n't like that had ` stability ' instead of finding one they do like . 
  to be honest , i 'd give my left ball to have been born in 1996 instead of 1986 . 
  in the uk ( at least when i went there - about 13 years ago ) . 
  * there 's is n't so much the jocks/nerds group segregation that the us has ( at least from their tv ) . 
  it 's largely divided into groups of friends . 
  whilst these groups may be designated the `` cool kids '' / `` nerds '' etc there 's no real social stigma in interacting between groups . 
  * zero clubs , unless you want to start one yorself ( this might vary drastically from school to school ) . 
  we do have the duke of edinburgh things that people do - but that 's mostly for nra ( * national record of achievement * ... not the gun club ) padding . 
  * zero `` class government '' , the closest we have to that is class prefects - but they are n't voted on , instead you put your name forward and the head/deputy head teacher chooses from that group . 
  * back when i went , there was no prom . 
  we had a leavers disco . 
  but proms are becoming the norm over here . 
  that said , they 're nothing on the americans version - like , wtf is `` promposal '' and why are they so elaborate and stupid ?
