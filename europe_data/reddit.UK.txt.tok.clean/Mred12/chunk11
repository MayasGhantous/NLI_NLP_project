  there are parts of the country that fire/ambulance wo n't go without an escort . 
  but these areas are usually low-income and , 99 % of the time , divided on class . 
  whereas the ` classic ' fox no-go zone is largely divided by religion . 
  mostly shithole council estates in liverpool and the midlands . 
  that said , the fire service and ambulance have a duty of care that compels them to enter these areas in case of an emergency , but with a police escort . 
  to be fair tho , birmingham is pretty much a no go zone . 
  as in , * who the fuck wants to go to birmingham ?

  wonga and other `` pay day loan '' companies .

  yep !, 
  they mostly focus on the rat-pack 1950s theme . 
  the menu for most `` american '' restaurants here is - generally - burgers , and bbq food . 
   in school we just read really boring 19th century stuff about rich people getting married and trying to be pious , far from the madding crowd stands out as the most boring thing i have ever read . 
  in my school the english literature gcse groups were split in half , one half had macbeth and death of a salesman the other had the tempest and animal farm . 
  i was in the latter group . 
  yeah , leaving it a few years is a pretty good bet - at least until you/we have an idea about the effects of brexit ( or if we even brexit at all ) . 
  that said , * whatever * the economic fallout , london will always weather the storm . 
  if you 're planning in working as an architect , london might be a better bet than edinburgh . 
  lots of architectural companies round these parts ( and london is where all the jobs and money are ) ... brexit and it 's ripples are the only real worry , but no one ( even those in charge ) is quite sure what the effects are . 
  there 's equal arguments that the construction industry will grow or shrink to be honest . 
  as for the xenophobia , there * was * a spike after the vote , but it 's mostly dying down by now . 
  the media did demonise romanians for a while , but most of the xenophobia was aimed toward polish people - which shows the level of intelligence of the xenophobes of the country . 
  these days the papers have reverted back to `` spooky scary muslims '' .

  if you 're not having a pint with breakfast , you 're not on holiday .

  i do n't think i 've * ever * asked a shop assistant something without saying `` hi '' or `` excuse me '' first ( or both ) . 
  i 'd say it must just be a southern thing , but when i lived up in lancashire * every * conversation started with `` alright love '' , `` alright '' . 
  i guess * not saying hello * is a london thing ... 
  also `` two beers please '' . 
  do n't worry , we 'll do something stupid soon enough . 
  you 're only * borrowing * that particular spotlight . 
   which makes a lot more sense , and is a defensible position based on free market ( anti-socialist ) principles . 
  it 's possible to have a socialist state * and * a free market . 
  he understands it perfectly :  those people must be 1 ) insanely dumb or 2 ) nationalistic maniacs o_o although i would add `` straight up lied to '' . 
  as a brit , i 'd like to thank france for taking one for an old friend , and taking the focus away from brexit for a little while .

  but i * alnost never * wash my fruit or veg . 
  i mean , if they 're crusted with mud i 'll wash them but that 's about the only time . 
  i 've probably eaten my fair share of mud and bugs in my life ... 
  according to the last eurovision , they hate us * slightly less * than germany .

  but the towels on the sunbeds is 100 % confirmed fact . 
  if it helps , from a british perspective , a lot of our humour is of the self-deprecating kind - and we generally assume our way is the only proper way . 
  so , from our point of view , it would make perfect sense that a german would * just love * jokes about world war 2 .

   turkey is a poor country * `` turkey is the world 's 16th and europe 's 6th largest economy '' * `` istanbul and ankara are among the biggest cities in the world in terms of gdp '' * `` turkish banking sector is one of them [ * sic * ] most robust among europe . '', 
  * `` turkey is one of the fastest growing energy markets in the world . '',

  no idea . 
  some sort of black magic . 
  all i know is that the applications and inductions are n't a yearly event , and there 's a number of policies the country needs to have in place before they 're accepted . 
  that said , turkey initially applied to join the eu in * 1987 * . 
  from [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35832035 ) : '' * for visa liberalisation to happen , turkey has to meet 72 benchmarks on everything from biometric passports to judicial cooperation . 
  several eu leaders - francois hollande among them - have also insisted that there can be no short-cuts for turkey ; it has to fulfilall the criteria before visa-free travel to countries in the schengen area can begin . 
  * '' and '' * for a start , it is very difficult for would-be members to clear all the hurdles required . 
  a country has to adopt and enforce all the current eu rules before it can be admitted to the bloc . 
  eu rules are divided into 35 policy areas and in 10 years turkey only managed to adopt the rules on one : science and research . 
  in most other areas it has not even made a start . 
   so there wo n't be a direct vote from the population ? 
  the ruling parties send forth the prime minister ? 
  ( this is also how we do it in the netherlands ) no ( well , no for the general population - registered conservatives can vote iirc ) . 
  the ironic thing is the `` leave '' campaign ran under the idea that the people of the uk are being dictated to by unelected officials in brussels ... and because of that were getting a pm we did n't vote for . 
   exactly , that was my thought ; the second referendum by proxy could save a lot among the stay side * potentially * . 
  the current likley candidates for interim pm are both * in favour * of enacting article 50 , and the next general election could be in 2020 , so they 'll have a lot of time to ` pull the trigger ' . 
  add to that the eu president is quite eager for us to enact article 50 sooner rather than later ( if we 're going to ) , it leads to the uk 's future being a bit uncertain for the next 4 years . 
   the prime minister slot is open ; and likely will be filled before article 50 is invoked the prime minister is needed to enact article 50 , so we need one * before * it can be enacted . 
   ( how ) does the uk get prime minister get elected ? 
  normally , through general election ( not exactly , we vote for the * party * here , rather than the * person * ) , since the conservatives are in power , they 're going to have an intra-party vote to decide the pm . 
   does the prime minister have power to veto the whole brexit thing ? 
  yes , the referendum was advisory . 
  but going against the will of the people would be career suicide for the incoming pm . 
  unless he gets in under the line of `` i wo n't enact article 50 '' . 
   how likely is it that the next election prime minister will be a second eu referendum in disguise ? 
  the `` third party '' in the uk ( the liberal democrats ) have already stated that , if they get into power , they will ignore the referendum result and wo n't enact article 50 . 
  so the writing is already on the wall for that . 
  of course , that depends on if the incoming pm will call for article 50 to be enacted * before * the general election .
