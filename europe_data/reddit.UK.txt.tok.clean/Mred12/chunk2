  apparently it 's in london too :( . 
  we ca n't even videotape ourselves talking around with wine any more . 
  as someone living in london : take your wage . 
  now plug that * entire * figure into a website for houses to rent . 
  there 's your reason . 
  or say it 's just a stupid comic book that 's printed backwards, 
  best : boston . 
  worst : not boston . 
  the british rode in on the wind . 
  zombie . 
  spiders . 
   as a londoner it 's obvious moving away from the city is one of the first most beneficial solutions . 
  also a londoner ( if a fairly recent transplant ) i 've also played with the idea of `` is it safer to stay or go '' - although , i admit , in relation to zombie outbreaks . 
  whilst the population density is a major problem when it comes to * most * disasters like this , i believe london ( or any major city ) would be the safest place to be . 
  for one , the population density lends itself to a greater availability of food within easy access ( and not just for the zombies , natch ) . 
  and if whatever is causing this problem is a uk ( or europe ) specific problem instead of a global one , where in britian would be `` secured '' first ? 
  the ( for example ) cornish countryside might seem safer , but they might have to contend with hordes of zombies/whatever for * years * after london is deemed safe . 
  that said , if whatever causes the end of the world does n't have a `` monster '' element ( i.e. 
  solar flairs , viruses , etc ) then the increased competition for supplies would make city life harder . 
  so , i guess it 's down to the type of apocalypse . 
  you too !, 
  `` ere , dave said he did n't want to be part of lichtenstein any more '' `` well , that 's going to make mikes birthday very awkward '', 
  when i 'm daydreaming i either think about how different my life would be if i won # 100million on euromillions , or what i 'd do if zombies happened . 
  in the latter , i 'd barricade my flats stairwell and wait out the initial panic . 
  after a week or two , i 'll raid other flats around mine for supplies . 
  it 's barebones , because in a city ( london ) of 8million + you 'll have to think on the fly a bit . 
  ( in the former , i 'd probably buy a nice 4 bedroom in zone 2 and live off the # 10k daily interest ) . 
  well , * you 're * someone i would n't want to go into the cdc with ... 
  one of our ministers already threatened spain with war , and brexit has n't even happened yet . 
  in the uk at least , `` hazard perception '' is a major part of learning to drive . 
  that and `` stop , look , listen , think '' being drilled into us from the moment we can walk . 
  it 's practically encouraged in london . 
  he owns durex ? 
  the english refuse to take a sheep as a wife . 
  such poor integration . 
  zero . 
  as an aside , my friend recently had a baby , and they told me ( when asked if they want any more ) `` all my life i 've always wanted two kids , now i 've got one , i kinda want no kids '' . 
  welsh people shag sheep . 
  but it 's a cultural thing , so we have n't the heart to stop them . 
  ^ ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ right . 
  '' * yes , english can be weird . 
  it can be understood through tough thorough thought , though * '' and that 's before we even start on loughborough, 
  pie & mash , fish & chips , kebab . 
   i 'd say that our motorways and fast speed trains are much better than in the uk . 
  setting yourselves a low bar there ... 
  ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ america . 
  well , they 've already got one of their own as queen here , so we 'd probably ally with the aliens . 
  and we 're back to  assuming that `` southern england = london '' ... 
  the only part of the south you 've lived in is the bit london is in ? 
  do n't forget their mines and steel works ... oh . 
  south * easterners * . 
  i 've lived in the north west and south west , and the people are remarkably similar . 
  everyone just lumps the entire south in with london . 
  lots of people , including op , is assuming that `` southern england = london '' ... 
  we 're a nation of binge drinking borderline alcoholics with very poor impulse control . 
  we 're europe 's id . 
  just imagine what our towns and cities are like at the weekend . 
  let 's not forget shagaluf, 
  ` cos it dodges fuckin bullets , avi . 
  the ideal is : `` hello and welcome to [ company ] , is there anything i can help you with ? '', 
  `` no , i 'm fine thank you '' `` ok , feel free to get me if you need anything '', 
  i do n't really hang around school playgrounds , so i do n't really know . 
  but i 've seen them ( and `` fidget cubes '' ) in those natty shops that always sell that type of bullshit . 
  so , they 're pretty much a novelty really . 
  like those solar powered flowers that bob around . 
  you forgot [ londependence ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_independence ), 
   as for gender imbalance , i do n't see any reason why there should be more 30 y.o women than 30 y.o men in ukraine . 
  at 15-65yo there 's a ratio of 0.92:1 , men to women ( for comparison the ratio of the uk is 1.03:1 ) . 
  so it 's not exactly a * huge * imbalance , on a world stage * everywhere * ( barring a couple of sausage parties - looking at you bahrain and qatar ) is around [ 0.90-1 .10 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_sex_ratio ) men to women . 
  even china is 1.06 , which is worse than the uk , but better than the us ( 1.07 ) . 
   as a matter of fact , in some cases it was only due to luck that you did n't overtake britain on the world stage . 
  [ and there was that one time ... ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/norman_conquest_of_england ), 
  i think the stereotype is that ee women are more subservient and into `` traditional '' gender roles ( similar to the stereotype of e.asian women ) . 
  as opposed to `` western '' women who have been `` ruined '' by feminism . 
  once a week , got ta build up my natural musk to attract the womenfolk . 
  you must be an excessively sweaty person . 
   twice a day . 
  are you a * fuckin fish * , bruv ? 
  do you need to keep water running over your gills so you do n't die ? 
  not really . 
  if trump was going to something stupid , he 'd probably tweet about it first , giving us all enough warning, 
  the planet killed his parents, 
  * all of them ? 
  fun fact ; i went to university in preston lancashire ( where that video was filmed ) . 
  it 's * exactly * like that 100 % of the time . 
  it almost makes me feel nostalgic . 
   i dont see a problem in killing those who opress the own people . 
    weakening the opressors moral by attacking civilians is a acceptable tactic in a freedom fight given that isis believe that they 're being oppressed by the west , and that they 're trying to carve out their own country . 
  are we to assume you 're ok with the attacks in western europe ? 
  for some reason , i just assumed german youtube was just people reading the terms and conditions from extended warranty forms . 
   ** scenario 1 : ** you live in a democracy . 
  every election , referendum , etc. 
  the votes are however never in your interest . 
  so if no matter what you believed , there would never be any change that you would agree with . 
  how is this any different from a dictatorship , from my point of view . 
  so the choice is a dictator who i 'm against or a dictator who agrees with me ? 
  before i moved out of dorset , the biggest bullshit was a campaign of retirees to try and block housing developments and any plans to rejuvenate the county , because it would lower the value of their houses * slightly * . 
  in a county with some of the largest disparity between house value and average wage ( 300:21 , to be exact ) . 
  * then * they complained about all these `` lazy youth '' who wo n't get a job ( in an area with no jobs ) and wo n't move out of their parents house ( because , sadly , the money fairy did n't give them a few hundred grand on their 18th birthday ) . 
  dorset is just full of old people pushing around their considerable political weight to keep the the county as their own 1950 's playground .
