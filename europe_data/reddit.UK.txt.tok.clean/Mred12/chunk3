  black americans are viewed as americans ; loud , excitable , and too friendly . 
  native americans ? 
  we do n't , as a country , really have a point of reference beyond disney/cowboy films . 
  that said , the average brit would be more interested in a native american than prejudicial toward them . 
  assuming we do n't just assume they 're spanish/hispanic, 
  as our best hope for olympic gold again ? 
  no wonder she 's pulling that face , that food is n't crying and begging for it 's life . 
  the pavements are owned by the local councils/governement so it 's their responsibility to keep them in working order ( meaning filling pot holes and clearing snow/ice ) . 
  so the path in front of a shop ( for example ) will be maintained by the local council . 
  on the other hand , doorsteps , drives , and garden paths are owned by the homeowner , so it 's their responsibility to keep them clear . 
  at least , that 's how the uk handles it . 
  the last year has been pretty hard on you , eh ? 
  you know what . 
  i ca n't think of a single thing . 
  not ^ even ^ ^ on ^ e, 
   yes . 
  there were even found ties between the russian government and the party . 
  so i guess their opposition will have their emails leaked then ... 
  oh sweet summer child, 
  there 's even people from the midlands posting here , can you imagine ? 
   so ... ireland , we 'll just go over for a piss up , claim it was a war and scam the un for aid to rebuild our ` shattered nations ' ( which will probably be spent on bevvy , restarting the whole cycle ) . 
  is n't that basically the plot to trainspotting 2 ? 
  sweden and belarus sure a looking smug ... 
  according to recent news : spain . 
   in seriousness though , it 's becoming more common among young danes atleast , to use similar phrases , probably due to influence from british/american media ... 
  i do n't think we ( british ) can lay blame on the americans for this one . 
  i 've heard from quite a few american ex pats ( in real life and on reddit ) that our tendency to say `` are you ok ? '', 
  to mean `` hello '' is a little unnerving at first - because it seems like we 're always asking them why they look so sickly . 
   and the other thing is that if you ask a nordic person `` how are you ? '', 
  be prepared to get an actual anser instead of `` fine , how are you ? '' . 
  * ouch * . 
  that makes me wince . 
  over here `` how are you ? '', 
  or `` are you alright ? '', 
  means `` hello '' . 
  now it looks like a school . 
   you can never tell if stereotypes are just hyped or actually true . 
  surely , as a fellow brit , you are aware that * most countries * overstate their social quirks as a joke ? 
  iirc they 're not open all day sunday , only smaller stores escape sunday trading laws . 
   is there a time of day or week when pretty much everything is closed ? 
  sunday evening . 
   can you easily get basic supplies , like milk or common groceries in the middle of the night ? 
  there 's usually a 24-hr shop near most people , quite a few supermarkets are 24/6 now . 
   can you get food at some sort of restaurant ( fast food or anything ) at night ? 
  mcdonalds has started opening 24 hour restaurants . 
  quite a few takeaways are open until 3/4am . 
  regular restaurants close at about 11 . 
   do bars close at a set time where you live ? 
  depends on their licence . 
  some close at 11 , some at 2 , some are 24 hour ( in reality , even the 24 hour ones close for an hour or so - usually 5 till 6 am - to clean and restock )  for anything you answered yes to above , why is this the case ? 
  people work late , mostly . 
  and some people like to do their shopping late at night . 
   are stores that are open late more like convenience stores , with small selections and high prices , or large stores like walmart ? 
  both . 
  there 's spa stores ( usually open until 10 ) which have a small stock and are quite overpriced . 
  there 's best one 's ( small convenience stores ) that are usually open 24/7 , and places like tesco ( britain 's version of walmart ) and asda ( * literally * the british wing of walmart ) that are also open 24/7 . 
  yeah , i do n't know what one is either . 
  want to trade ? 
  our one never flip flops . 
  even when she really should . 
  i thought steve bannon was your president ? 
  stand side by side on the escalator . 
  if you feel the urge to take a photo , ride with it , you and your 7 family members should just stop and pose in the street . 
  be sure to give dirty looks to anyone who interrupts your impromptu photo shoot . 
  make sure you ask any passerby if they 're worried about a terrorist attack . 
  leave your pineapple at home . 
   imply that we 're gypsies . 
  especially since you 're all vampires . 
  if it was anything like brexit ; 48 % are feeling scared and angry , and 52 % are feeling smug and self assured . 
  our isolationist nature , our ` protestant work ethic ' , our drinking culture . 
  i always assumed hygge was a type of light lunch with open faced sandwiches . 
  alright ? 
  * alright * alright . 
  my girlfriend has about a million of them . 
  lynx ( axe in the us ) even released a [ `` butch '' ] ( http://static.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/affordable-products-lynx-manwasher.jpg ) one for men . 
  i 've got it , it 's ok . a little rough on my balls . 
  in the last election , my constituency had a man stand that was a full on `` chemtrails are making frogs gay '' conspiratard . 
  his campaign leaflet had , like , 7 eyes of providence on it . 
  we also had the p.a.r.t.y party and the free the weed party put forward candidates . 
  long story short , it only costs about 100 quid to stand in an election . 
   my favourite has to be bigotgate !, 
  my vote goes for gategate ( later renamed plebgate ), 
  according to google , mrs. brown 's boys d'movie is british/irish . 
  so that . 
  sure ... but let 's work on * old * mexico first , then we can try for new mexico . 
   during the olympics the american version cut out a part of the 2012 olympics for an `` all exclusive interview with michael phelps '' iirc , the part that was cut was a tribute to the victims of the 7/7 bombings . 
   if you want to post any of these types of things on your wall i would recommend making your profile fully private , not have any colleagues able to see it and unlink your work iirc even private profiles/pages are considered public ( unlike , for example , a conversation in your own house ) because there 's a chance people can leak what you said . 
  there was a case a few years back about the head of the student conservatives at my uni saying racist stuff on a private fb page - it was uncovered by a reporter from the student newspaper . 
  he got fired , of course . 
  general rule for life should be : * `` unless you 're willing to bear the consequences for what you said - for the rest of your life - do n't write it down '' *, 
   yes/no , it 's public space and if your company can easily be connected to your profile it 's not in your favour to bring politics in . 
  similar to the uk then , * most companies * have the rule ( in regards to social media ) that if it 's * known * that you work there , you represent the company 24/7 . 
  if you bring the company into disrepute , you 're gone . 
   i have posted a few things on my ` wall ' to the effect of ` we should n't recognise trump or other leaders put into power via the deep state ' * i mean ... *, 
   should i withdraw politics from there ? 
  yes . 
  in the uk at least , a facebook wall is considered a public space . 
  so anything you say on there you must be comfortable saying in front of * all * your facebook friends ( and , in some cases , * all their friends * also ) . 
  lots of people found this out the hard way during the brexit vote , quite a few friendships were ended , and family meals ruined . 
   and is it legal for employers to fire people based on what they post on their social media/their political opinions in your country ?
