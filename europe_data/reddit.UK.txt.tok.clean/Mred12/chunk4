  yes and no . 
  as i said above , what you say on facebook is the same as saying it in person ( except with a written record ) . 
  if you badmouth your boss/work , bully , or say something that reflects badly on your company , you can be fired . 
  but you ca n't be fired for your political views alone . 
  we 've ran out of wood . 
  they report news , not criticism . 
  the hosts are n't allowed to express their own opinions , they can only report what other people have said . 
   i might be reading things into things , but do you mean ` current goverment ' as in ` theresa mays government , opposed to previous governments ' or do you mean every government which is at that moment is the current government ? 
  normally it 's the latter , the beeb has a slight lean toward maintaining the status quo . 
  the current tories have a much more slash and burn approach to the bbc 's budget , so they might be trying to appease them more than normal . 
  i might be wrong , but right wing groups were * more common * in britain in the 90 's than today . 
   we ** were ** number 1 ##  england : ** were ** number 1 . 
  it seems a few people missed my sly , self depreciating , grammar joke . 
  it 's a reference to the game [ plague inc. ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/plague_inc . 
  ) , in the game madagascar is on a bit of a hair trigger and will shut their ports at the first sign of problems , essentially making the game unbeatable afterward . 
  fun fact : since 2011 the government has * repeatedly * cut funding to the nhs . 
  making at least two of those posters disgusting bullshit . 
  the vote was democratic , it was also dishonest . 
  last i heard belgium did n't have a government ... 
  i assume they sorted that out . 
  frist of all , * how dare yo u * . 
  margate is a jewel in the british seaside crown . 
  sorry , someone sneezed last week and they shut down all the ports . 
  england : were number 1 . 
  ah , it was 50/50 . 
  you not being 10 just reminds me that i 'm 30 . 
  would not expect anything less from germany . 
  are the mrlp still campaigning for a 99p coin ? 
  because that 's a policy i can get behind . 
  you 're either 96 or ... 
  ikea has always existed . 
  in the hearts of men , the smiles of children , the loins of women . 
  ikea is love , ikea is life . 
  are you a robot ? 
  because , unless we make it clear , y' all assume we 're americans . 
  nigel farage . 
  never became ( or will become ) the pm but has managed to lead the country into brexit , successfully get the vote for brexit , and has fundamentally moved the conservative party further to the right . 
  if he was n't such a snake , he 'd be regarded as a single ex-mp who managed to change the entire future of the country . 
  also , he 's a cunt . 
  russia has been trying to dismantle the eu for a long time ** but ** the mail , express , and sun probably did more damage than putin . 
  ^ ( but hot ) they always are . 
  assuming we 're not talking about the ivy league here . 
   american universities hold a prestige around the world this is , unfortunately , a lie told to you by the companies that want you to rack up $ 100k + of student loan debt . 
   so my question is am i better off just studying the same thing at some local , ** relatively unknown ** university in the united states i 'll answer your question , with a couple of my own ... 
  i have a degree from the university of central lancashire . 
  is uclan a respected university ? 
  how does it compare to , for example , southampton university ? 
  is a degree from uclan worth the # 20,000 in student loans i racked up ? 
  if you ca n't answer those questions , then people looking at your cv wo n't be able to answer the same ones about texas tech ( or wherever ) . 
   tl ; dr : would an american with a us degree have better opportunities in europe than an american with a european degree ? 
  probably it would be quite the disadvantage to have an american degree in europe - just as much as having a british one outside of britain , french outside of france , etc. 
  for the reasons stated above , unless it 's a well known uni , people tend to prefer degrees from universities within their own country ( as they know how good or bad they are ) . 
  that is n't to say having a foreign degree is worthless . 
  it 's just not the universally respected golden ticket you 've been told it is . 
  no idea , i 'm going to assume uk gallons . 
  i do n't know who 's idea it was to have two different units have the same name , but every mishap it 's caused is on their shoulders . 
  18-20 is still * pretty bad * , compared to here . 
  my car ( astra excite ) does about 45mpg , and it 's not even considered an ` eco ' car . 
  the fiesta , yaris , and clio are all high 80/low 90 mpg, 
  around here it 's about # 1.19 per litre ( about $ 1.45 ) . 
  it 's not going to be too long before the retirement age here is `` 1 year post life '', 
  but seriously tho , * what the fuck * is a pineapple ? 
  sven injected 3 whole marinas and started world war 3 . 
  marinating , not even once . 
  ah , * this * is where the uk and france differs . 
  very true . 
  but because of the typically low cost of fuel in the us , us car manufacturers have n't placed the same importance on mpg that non-us ones have . 
  also america seems to have a weird truck based subculture that seems to deify trucks based on their wanton disregard for the environment . 
   russia allied with turkey to bomb isis . 
  not really . 
  russia allied with assad to bomb isis , and turkey allied with america to bomb isis . 
  america also allied with the kurds to fight isis whilst the kurds are * decidedly not * allied to turkey , russia , or assad . 
  at no point were turkey and russia allies ( neither were/are russia and america , as evidenced by russia ignoring americas commands to stop bombing civilians ) . 
  during this time , turkey also shot down a russian jet for violating their airspace - almost causing an international incident - which is n't really the actions of allies . 
  it 's a complicated situation , and there 's no clear `` us v them '' , just a diverse cast of countries and alliances all fighting one group separately . 
  deep down , we all knew that the netherlands would cause ww3, 
   * we do n't refuse to speak english because arrogance , we just are very bad at speaking it . 
  the more i learn about france , the more i think we 're ... * quite similar * . 
  petrol/diesel in the us is typically 1/3 the price that it is over in europe ( specifically the uk , but it 's a similar across the board ) . 
  at a guess , in the uk you 'd need a light goods vehicle licence for that ( or possibly it could get by as a van , not needing a special licence ) . 
  since the vast majority of yank tanks do n't make it across the ocean , it 's hard to give an estimate on the value . 
  likely it 'll be an imported collectors thing , so triple the price you paid . 
  it would , though , be exempt from road tax . 
  for comparison , i once knew a guy who had a 1970 's stingray ( or firebird , do n't really remember and not an expert ) , he told me it cost him # 15k to buy initially , and sets him back # 4-600 per year in mot + general upkeep and maintenance . 
  i do n't know why , he seems so nice , he just irks me for some reason . 
   it 's illegal in austria . 
  they know that by taking an austrian passport but keep their turkish one anyway . 
    it 's a crime and they deserve punishment . 
  sounds more like it 's a faulty system of passports and immigration . 
  hey , you know what democratic , free nations do ? 
  strip people of their citizenship for the crime `` being born somewhere else '' . 
  [ this one ] ( https://i.reddituploads.com/e8cbe1e9dbcf44c7aa39e27a7fa83fd2?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=b38437c050beb01b733722045209ea2d ) , but only because i 'm pissed off about how much my rent is . 
  i prefer [ this one ] ( http://static.neatorama.com/images/2006-07/good-morning-lemmings.jpg ), 
  `` loud '' and `` unfashionable '' are the two main ones around these parts . 
  that and `` will buy any old tat with the union jack , the queen , or a london skyline on '' . 
   i have to say though , i 'm surprised that we have a reputation of binge drinking as an english ... you guys have so much to learn . 
  in r/london they mostly spam pictures of london . 
  like , we get it , we live here . 
  stop showing us the london eye at sunrise . 
  i quite like mle , sadly as a middle class country boy people laugh at me when i say `` wagwan blud , y' get me ?
