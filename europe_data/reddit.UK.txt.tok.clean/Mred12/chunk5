  also , you speak polish . 
  so you already speak two languages more than the average english person , and three more than the average scot . 
  this bot is almost as patronising as the one that pops up when you say `` must of '' . 
  somerset ? 
  i think they 're a london only thing , and even then only really central london . 
  daily use : whatsapp , reddit is fun , bank/credit card/paypal apps , ebay , facebook , twitter , spotify , and podcast addict . 
  recently i 've been on the reed.co.uk , monster , salary bot , and movebubble apps almost daily . 
  infrequently : ubereats , deliveroo , myfitnesspal . 
   how do you make time for all these apps ? 
  a healthy bowel ? 
  # 20 per month , 4g 35mbs , unlimited downloads . 
  we normally get around 20 meg download speed , not amazing but enough to watch netflix .

  it 's kinda sad that alcopops are on the wane . 
  they were a big part of my teen years , it 's like when you found out [ h from steps has died ] ( http://www.hypedup.co.uk/pictures/steps.jpg ), 
  the british and french are more similar than either are prepared to admit . 
   british ciders ( ** magners ** and weston 's wyld wood ) that i drink . 
  do teens not drink breezers any more ? 
  i miss the days of watermelon breezers in the park . 
  bight pink puke is the strongest memory . 
  in the uk you can legally drink beer and cider from , like , 5 . 
  but there 's conditions ( at home , with family , during a meal ) . 
  to buy it from a shop/bar you have to be 18 tho . 
  that said , most of us start trying our chances to get in and served at around 16 . 
  be gay ? 
   theresa may is a christian ( daughter of a vicar ) , as are other politicians , but i 've never ... our christians seem to be quietly religious and overall quite moderate in their beliefs . 
  may believes that her faith ( and god specifically ) is guiding brexit . 
  [ the old/young divide in the uk summed up in a single chart ] ( https://www.youthdebates.org/uploads/db0565/optimized/2x/9/9f6dc9bd10508558cb8a13d474b155fae0a655ba_1_690x279.jpeg ), 
  iirc , it 's south african chain pretending to be a portuguese chain . 
   it 's far more common in australia and nz than uk and was quite possibly brought to the uk rather than originating here ... because there 's no other instances of * rhyming slang * in the uk ? 
  would you adam and eve it , i ca n't think of a single one . 
  is it because we keep opening more nandos ? 
  we should probably add `` if your question is about immigrants or refugees , please use the search function . 
  it 's probably already been asked '' .

  * you mean they 've slowed down ?

  * next you 'll be telling me there 's a general strike in france . 
   for germany : do n't . 
  really , do n't . 
  not even if 23andme told you that you 're 45/64 german . 
  what if you 're 14/88 german ? 
  something like [ this ] ( https://cdnc.lystit.com/photos/2f44-2015/10/02/puma-chestnut-roma-brown-product-0-637569614-normal.jpeg ) . 
   * * london * - crowded , ** too many tourists ** , expensive unless op gets a job ( or , for some mad reason , an apartment ) in one of the tourist areas , this is n't a huge issue . 
  i live about 10/15 mins walk from oxford sreet , soho , chinatown , and piccadilly circus and whilst tourists are a * major pain * in those areas , where i am there are almost none . 
  argos tottenham court road is n't a major draw for the grockles . 
  wait , lots of the lights around these parts have `` red light cameras '' on them to catch people running red lights . 
  i 'm pretty sure they do n't work at night tho , but not sure enough to bet # 100 and 3 points . 
  turkey is more likely than russia . 
  but * neither * are particularly likely . 
  plus , depending on the apocalypse , the people themselves would feed a significant population of rats . 
  let 's say londons population is reduced to 1 million people . 
  if it 's all in one day that 's 7 million corpses to feed them , * plus * any food in shops , bins , dumps , and any remaining animals - so while there will be a spike in rat population , it should die back down within a generation or two . 
  ** edit : ** of course , during that `` generation or two '' we would experience a swarm of rats of epic proportions . 
  a single person can sustain * approx * 300 rats . 
  so 7 million bodies * could * sustain a population of 2.1 * billion * rats . 
  if it 's over the course of 5 years ( for example ) , that 's just over 1 million new bodies * every year * ( or 2,700 * per day * ) and it 's not like `` open a mortuary '' is the top of people 's ` to do ' lists in a post apocalypse situation . 
  that alone will sustain a rat population , and that 's before we consider graveyards and the like . 
  the start of metro 2021 had a massive swarm of rats coming out of an abandoned metro station and flooding through the metro lines , eating everything/one in their path . 
  that 's how , given enough time , i 'd imagine the london underground will be like . 
  basically a dark , dank , sprawling man made cave swarming with starving , cannibalistic , rats . 
  not a pleasant place . 
  on the one hand , staying in london has advantages like higher density of potential items to scavenge ( from abandoned shops , restaurants , apartments , etc ) , and it 'll be the first place ( in england ) people will look for survivors . 
  on the other hand , there 's greater density of people and with that a competition for the remaining supplies and liklihood of disease spreading . 
  and you have to consider londons rat population , without pest control the population of those buggers will explode in the years ( s ) following a hypothetical apocalypse , and they 're going to get very hungry , very quickly . 
  i could imagine that 5 , 10 , years after `` the event '' whole swathes of central london could be given over to the rats ( this is n't a problem unique to london - new york would also face down this situation * very quickly * , as would many cities worldwide ) . 
  another , animal , consideration is pets ( specifically dogs ) . 
  we 're a dog-owning nation , if there 's some event that wipes out a significant portion of the population there 's suddenly going to be a lot of hungry dogs on the loose . 
  they 're going to form themselves into loose ` packs ' and get feral , and to a hungry dog ( like a hungry rat ) we 're just another dinner . 
  this would be a greater issue outside of the cities ( as pet ownership is quite low in london due to the large renting economy ) . 
  that said , cat ownership should hold steady . 
  for one , they might keep away the rats . 
  basically , any animal that depended on us for food , will start considering * us * food . 
  if whatever caused this apocalypse left dead bodies in the streets , that will only speed up this process . 
  since it 's not a big jump from eating a dead body to creating one to eat . 
  in short , i want to play a game set in a post apocalypse london . 
  fallout : ldn ca n't come toon enough . 
  of course , if the apocalypse is zombies ignore everything i said . 
  stay away from london . 
  8 million potential zombies is n't a fun time . 
  if only st georges day fell during chinese new year . 
  they 've got the dragons , we 've got the dragonslayer . 
  it 's almost a perfect fit . 
  it 's a * big * step down from first to second . 
  [ annual tourists ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/galleries/britains-most-visited-cities/ ) ( top 5 ) : london - 16.7 million edinburgh - 1.3 million manchester - 988k birmingham - 941k liverpool - 562k, 
  or just , like , scotland ( not including americans who think they 're 1/32th william wallace ) . 
  most people who visit the uk stay in and around central london , so * anywhere * outside of there really . 
  i 'm pretty sure doratch has some sort of assignment to write about european culture and they 're just trying to wing it . 
  damnit bro , we all agreed to keep our rape and murder secret . 
  also i 'm a ghost ooo ^ oo ^ oo ^ o ^ o ^ oo, 
   was it a separate class or part of , say , biology classes ? 
  it was part of * three * classes . 
  * in year six ( age :10 / 11 ) the boys and girls are taken into seperate class rooms and told all about puberty and what to expect . 
  * years 7-9 ( ages 11-14 ) we had a `` life skills '' class every two weeks which covered general life skills - and included things like drugs , social contracts , and contraceptives . 
  * years 10-11 ( 15/16 ) sex , pregnancy , and birth ( including a * very graphic * video of the latter , which did better to avoid teen pregnancy than any contraceptive talk ) were all part of the biology syllabus . 
  tens of thousands of pounds of student debt , and everyone calling you lazy and entitled if you do n't want to work at mcdonald 's with a masters degree . 
  but you do get 20 % off in most stores . 
  so it evens out . 
  the uk 's relationship with the eu has always been a lot more frigid compared to the rest of the union countries , so i would n't read too much into us leaving .
