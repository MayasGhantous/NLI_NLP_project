  at any given time there 's * at least one * country threatening to leave the union ( usually it 's the uk ... so someone else will have to take our role soon enough ) . 
  [ o fortuna ] ( https://youtu.be/gxfsk0ogeg4 ) , because it just fits the way were heading . 
   for the main , [ toad in the hole ] ( https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_medium/public/recipe_images/recipe-image-legacy-id--804456_11.jpg?itok=myorq0hh ) i say we should go for the old classic : [ cock-in-the-hole ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/yu0n5/roast_chicken_w_yorkshire_pudding/ ), 
  he 's like a stupid persons impression of an intelligent person . 
  i 'd say a more likely candidate ( for the uk 's donald trump ) would be boris johnson : * born in america . 
  * has stupid blonde hair . 
  * is a cunt . 
  not * strictly * a politician , but ex-pm david cameron 's girlfriend is a bit of a [ looker ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/16/fb/f3/16fbf38ad25a3ec2429f6b355478ab18.jpg ), 
  chicken tikka masala with chips and donner meat . 
  let 's imagine we have a group of people where * around half * support groups that seek to remove rights from and almost normalise prejudice toward women and lgbt people . 
  then imagine that this group , looking at their violent crime rates , almost has a genetic propensity toward violent crime . 
  basically , what i 'm asking is this : should europe allow the immigration of americans ? 
  as has been pointed out elsewhere : the biggest criticism toward the bbc is '' * why are n't the bbc reporting on this ? 
  * '' the reason is that to report on something , because they 're so dedicated to impartially , they have to get multiple sources that agree on it . 
  which takes time , if it happens at all . 
  hell , when it comes to some topics ( vaccine links to autism ) their dedication to `` impartiality '' means they give airtime to * absolute morons * . 
   here , it 's generally perfectly legal to cross the road wherever you please . 
  that 's because our pedestrians are taught to look , listen , think before crossing and our drivers are taught ( and tested on ) the ability to assess hazards before they happen . 
  well , * i 'm * going to say germany . 
  because it 's a 33 % shot . 
  at least the `` smoke '' from a vape smells like vimto and goes away relatively quickly . 
  as an ex smoker i ca n't stand the smell of cigarettes , it makes me feel sick . 
  you just put a little hat on the a, 
  ** uk **  regulations regarding sale of alcohol ( shops , happy hours etc ) bars/clubs - dependant on licence . 
  some stop at 11/12 some go on to 4am . 
  others have a 24hr licence . 
  shops - again , dependant on the licence . 
  most shops apply to sell during their opening hours ( so it could be 9am-5pm , or it could also be 24hr ) `` happy hour '' is just a promotion , so there 's no regulation around that . 
   alcohol in advertising iirc , it ca n't be advertised on the tv before 9pm . 
   minimum drinking and purchasing age this is an interesting one ... * technically * it 's something like 5 to drink beer or cider with a meal with a parent . 
  but generally people go by the `` purchasing '' age of 18 as the `` legally able to drink by '' age . 
  95 % + of people have usually had a drink before that point tho . 
  but once you turn 18 , you can buy/consume anything . 
   drinking in public depends on the area , my hometown in dorset ( weymouth ) has real problems with drunk and disorderly conduct , so alcoholic drinks are n't allowed to be consumed ( on the streets ) in the town centre . 
  where i live now ( london ) seems a bit more lax about this . 
  ( and i believe that the uk has some of the most restrictive drinking laws in europe , but i 'm not 100 % ), 
   i was surprised to find out that guns are apparently legal in some european countries ... 
  but they are n't where i 'm from , they very much are legal in the uk . 
  they 're just heavily controlled ( handguns and assault rifles are banned tho ) . 
  you just need to prove that you 're not mental , you can keep the gun safely , and you have a reason to own it . 
  shotgun licences are easier to obtain than ones for rifles , etc as ` owning a farm - pest control ' is more than reason enough to own one , as is ` i 'm a member of a shooting club ' and ' i collect antique firearms ' . 
  the one thing that * absolutely will not * be accepted as a reason to own a gun is `` self/property defence '' and using a gun ( even to threaten ) in this manner will almost certainly get your licence revoked and you could face some jail time . 
  source : i grew up in the countryside , most farms have a gun . 
   that 's what i was suspecting really . 
  it seems this rape crisis has been covered by america without any real input from actual scandinavians . 
  to put sweden 's `` rape epidemic '' in perspective ; [ * `` official crime figures show the uk also has a worse rate for all types of violence than the u.s. and even south africa - widely considered one of the world 's most dangerous countries . 
  '' * ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196941/the-violent-country-europe-britain-worse-south-africa-u-s.html ) ^ ^ ^ daily ^ ^ ^ mail ^ ^ ^ link . 
  do you feel that we live in one of the most violent countries * in the world * ? 
  with a violent crime rate * five times * higher than the usa ? 
  of course not , but our definition of `` violent crime '' is * very broad * and includes crimes that have no element of physical violence . 
   * there 's already a word for systematic racism , it 's systematic racism !, 
  * also ` institutional racism ' . 
  norn iron is a different story . 
  oh god , those adverts ... `` what he needs is a bulletproof vest , not a different voting system '' * cringe * . 
  annie 's pretty young , we try not to sexualize her . 
  almost zero . 
  the only parties that are pro-pr ( porportional representation - in my opinion the most democratic voting system ) are the ones that wo n't get enough power to enact it ( lib dems , greens , and i believe ukip ) . 
  there was a vote a few years ago for something called av - alternative vote . 
  but that campaign was filled with more lies and hyperbole than the brexit vote and it 's failure was the final nail in the campaign for changing our electoral system . 
  liberal democrats - they 'll never get into power and , arguably , steal voters from labour , reducing the likelihood of getting the conservatives out of power . 
  but i ca n't buy into tactical voting , and wo n't vote for a party that does n't reflect my views just to get another party that does n't reflect my views out of power . 
  ( deep down , i believe my vote for the ld 's is also a vote against the country becoming a two-party state ) . 
  i 'm more interested in how someone can be xenophobic without being nationalistic . 
  it 's very arrogant to assume we 're alone in the universe . 
  of course , if and when we get in contact with them is a whole other issue . 
  then i 'd suggest you play against a russian . 
  because we never win , basically . 
  sure some of our lot were bastard , but hitler was * literally hitler * . 
  it was for food classification , basically to be `` class a '' bananas need to fulfil certain criteria . 
  things that are less than class a are n't banned , but certain supermarkets refuse to stock anything less than class a produce . 
  the real bullshit is n't `` the eu wants to define banana curvyness '' it 's `` we , for some reason , wo n't buy a banana that 's not * specifically curvy enough * '' . 
  we 're the baddies here , not the eu . 
  that said , `` imperfect '' produce is the new hip thing . 
  which is only a good thing to be honest , there 's too much food wasted because it does n't look `` perfect '' enough . 
  i hate playing the `` who has/had the worst politicians '' game with germans ... 
  maybe i should lay off the wine , i 'm seeing triple . 
  mandating that * all * men must serve and leaving it optional for women is pretty sexist . 
   a company in england e-mailed me based on my linkedin profile and offered me a `` whopping # 25.000-30 .000 + bonuses yearly salary '' for a project manager position ... a little research shows that the average yearly salary for a position like that is almost double that amount . 
  ... wait . 
  * i * earn around that for doing * about * that type of job . 
  fml . 
  theresa may ... oh , sorry , you said * elected * . 
  what if you 're grumpy and antisocial ? 
  like , for example , if you were british ? 
  i love the metro games ( they 're probably my favourite series ) , and i 'm working my way through the books now . 
  from what i can tell , unlike most book/film -  game adaptions , the games are written as almost a companion to the books instead of a replacement ( it helps that the games were , iirc , written by the books author ) . 
  the books are * far more in depth * obviously . 
  so they 're worth checking out if , like me , you like the setting/atmosphere .

  mercy bow coop '', 
  sci-fi : neo soviet post apocalypse ( metro , s.t.a.l.k.e.r , etc ) . 
  also post-apocalyptic fantasy is quite thin on the ground but i like it ( games workshop 's age of sigmar is the best example i can think of ) . 
  basically , i 'm a big fan of apocalypses and crushing soviet architecture .
