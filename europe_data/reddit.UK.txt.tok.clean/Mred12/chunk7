  sadly , i have to wait a month before i can reply . 
  but i already have my coffee and apple, 
  [ and a wagwan to you , too ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/inbetweeners/images/5/56/dc7fd910-24c5-4805-9898-ce56660b8c13_extra.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101011202330 ), 
  but where else will i get updates on maddie ? 
  my lunch break is normally a cup of coffee and an apple ... 
   do n't go outside !, 
  it 's full of queers , black and crime , oh if only diana were here !, 
  safe , bossman . 
  does n't it also have bit of pickle all up in there also ? 
  if there 's one thing i know it 's , at any given time , how far i am from a kabanos . 
  the only part that 's not true is the `` pretty much zero '' part . 
  if you do n't work in a desired profession or have the skills we need , it 's * very hard * to get a british citizenship . 
  and costly . 
  we 're talking * thousands * of pounds . 
  of course , if you 've got a bunch of money you can just buy your way into a british citizenship . 
  so your chances wo n't ever be zero . 
  black food is * a little * off putting . 
  mostly because the only black food most people ( who are only just encountering squid ink ) know is burnt food . 
   but she defends pasta with ketchup ( she 's british -- for all our american culinary sins it 's still verboten to put ketchup on pasta in the usa ) . 
  that 's a * pretty weird * thing to do over here also . 
  i 've had a turkish tripe soup , it was n't my bag . 
  the smell alone was something i wo n't forget easily . 
  i find tripe disgusting . 
  it 's all chewy and nasty , and has an odd ofter taste . 
  that said , some people love it . 
  so ymmv . 
  but i 'd reccomend you try it some time - for the experience alone , as nothing is more annoying than someone who claims to not like a food without ever trying it . 
  as a ginger , i can produce my own vitimin d . so its * okay * . 
  can i say scouse ? 
  because i want to say scouse . 
  oh yes . 
  encouraged , in fact . 
   but then they ruined top gear , so ... * clarkson * ruined top gear . 
  i assume , at the time , they had some assurance that we would n't be leaving the single market . 
   edit : that was before brexit to avoid confusion after brexit they held * almost weekly * web conferences where they re-affirmed their commitment to the uk . 
   paris ( hsbc have already announced ) did n't hsbc say that they were staying in britian * multiple times * , post brexit ? 
  leaving the single market must 've been the straw that broke their back . 
   not much will change unless brits do something really dumb congratulations for waking up from your year-long coma !, 
  i hope you 're not a david bowie fan . 
  [ one that happened to me ] ( https://imgur.com/zd0k4mu ) . 
  seems reasonable ? 
  i live in a first storey flat . 
  `` maybe it was in the downstairs neighbours bush ? '', 
  nope , it turns out that `` in bush '' means `` i 'll attempt to deliver it again tomorrow '' . 
  my surname is probably the most common in england , so heritage is pretty much a lost cause . 
  also lots of the family members further up the family tree seem to have no history . 
  so its safe to say i probably come from a proud line of whores , liars , and thieves . 
  it 's not * awful * , it 's just behind the times . 
  fiber internet rollout is extremely slow , so a lot of places ( that you would n't expect ) do n't have access to it yet . 
  it 's galling because my old flat in the dorset countryside has faster internet than my flat in fitzrovia . 
  when it comes to the * price * tho , yeah . 
  it 's as bad as you 've heard . 
  my internet is 4g , so i do n't pay line rental , so it 's fairly cheap ( # 20pm ) , but if you go for fiber , prices * start * at # 25 + # 15 line rental . 
  sorry , i 'm still loading up your previous comment . 
  oh you do n't need to tell me , i know all about it . 
  i live in central london , want to know how fast my int ... int ... ** buffering **, 
  according to last podcast on the left , their impression of england is that we 're much more tolerant of `` day drinking '' ... which * is n't wrong * . 
  a swamp with faster internet than central london, 
  the [ cheeky girls ] ( https://youtu.be/35uusmnwquo ) ? 
  your fabulous internet ? 
  they make too much noise ? 
  lots of people really overestimate their ability to make a decent cup of tea . 
  i guess we 're going to find out who we 're invading tomorrow . 
   the french were * infamous * for their lack of skill , lack of english skills , and `` maverick gameplay style '' ( i do what i want , fuck the party ) . 
  the english and french have more in common than they 'd like to admit , i see . 
  eliza dushku , ` faith ' from buffy , is part-albanian . 
  so now you know that too !, 
  bur bruges is a * bit shit * . 
  i much preferred my time in brussels . 
   then your government has got a shit strategy , but i think everybody knows that already . 
  hey now !, 
  out current plan is `` red , white , and blue brexit '' . 
  which , * i think * , means we 're going to annex france ? 
  if you 've only met one french person , they could be a right bastard and that 'd still be true . 
  even donnerstag ? 
  * germany * norway * poland beer , women , kabanos . 
   i know a few people who have usually names and go by a simpler name , but all their official documents etc are still in there original name . 
  interestingly , when the nurse asked my mum what my name was , she wrote down the long version instead of what my mum actually said ( stephen v steve for example ) . 
  so the name on my birth certificate is n't actually the name my mum wanted to give me . 
  i 'd imagine that only holders of uk passports can change their name with a deed pol, 
   after naturalization it would mean they have uk cityzenship ? 
  yes . 
   that sounds wrong . 
  how will you confirm that you are who you say you are if you have a nother name writen in a passport ? 
  names in the uk are very fluid things . 
  since there 's no requirement to carry any proof of id , your name is , generally , whatever you say it is - most people consider this type of anonymity a right in the uk . 
  that 's usually good enough for most things ( including utilities and - depending on the bank - bank accounts ) . 
  this is the reason why facebooks `` real name '' policy fizzled out when they tried to bring it to the uk . 
  `` legal names '' are a different beast . 
  that 's the name on your passport , driving licence , and birth certificate . 
  to change that you need some sort of `` proof '' that your name has changed . 
  the most common thing for that is a deed pol . 
  mostly it 's so your previous and new names are recorded * somewhere * . 
  this is for tax purposes mostly , when you pay your tax you have to give you name , legal name ( if different ) , and any previous aliases ( if any ), 
   they have nothing to do with actual european life . 
  [ if only it was that easy ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01885/osama-bin-laden-yo_1885613b.jpg ) - second from right is osama bin laden . 
  it 's usually done * after * naturalisation , so it 's as legal as any name change over here . 
  i do n't know how it works for eu nationals living over here ( but not having citizenship ) . 
  as for official documents , it depends on how you changed your name . 
  deed pol is for changing passports/driving licences .
