  but for everything else you can just start using another name . 
  i 'm going to take that at face value , bro . 
  sometimes `` close '' means '' * looks * similar to '' or `` starts with the same letter '' . 
  sadly , because our deed pol and legal name requirements are so informal i do n't think that changing your name in the uk would hold much legal weight outside of our borders . 
  and , i 'm not 100 % , but i think it only applies to citizens of the uk . 
  yeah but we 're bro 's now , right ? 
  south dorset ( where i grew up ) : # 21k p.a london ( where i live now ) : # 48k p.a, 
  lots of foreigners , when coming to the uk , adopt `` british '' names ( usually the closest sounding name to their original ) so they do n't have to deal with people constantly mispronouncing their name . 
  in place of that document you can take out an advert in a national newspaper that says something like :  ( your name ) of ( address ) will now be going by ( new name ) . 
  alternatively , if you are n't concerned by the name on your passport you can just [ start using a new name . 
  ] ( https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview )  you do n't have to follow a legal process to start using a new name . 
  but you might need a ` deed poll ' to apply for or to change official documents like your passport or driving licence . 
  somewhere between `` would you like a cup of tea , vicar ? '', 
  and `` stop those bloody bells , i have a hangover '' . 
   `` i live in a big city . 
  i hardly ever use a car . 
  why do i need one if i can summon one on an uber style app '' . 
  i , and uber themselves , am very much in favour of this . 
  but nationwide rollout of a driverless hailed car system is less likley than a driverless nationwide light rail system . 
  to be honest . 
  londons dlr is a driverless train . 
  the question is for `` eu members '' . 
  london - [ somewhere between 28-52 % of properties sold ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/nov/14/london-property-foreign-investors ), 
   oh i know right well who the brexitons are , absolute eejiting cunts who are putting my lovely northern ireland to ruin . 
  you mean , 44 % of northern ireland ? 
  the offspring of two commoners , * third in line to the throne ? 
  * she was only lady spencer when she died ( iirc ) , it was the public/press that insisted on calling her princess . 
  so her and dodi 's kid would 've been an earl at most i 'd bet . 
   mind you , dodi fayed was an odd sort of champagne quaffing , out-of-wedlock-shagging muslim if you ask me . 
  he did n't come across as the most hardliner muslim around ... 
  that princess diana 's death was an organised assassination carried out by mi6 ( * technically * sis ) on the orders of prince philip/the queen . 
  believers say the reason for the hit was because she was dating ( * possibly with intent to marry * ) - and rumoured to be pregnant by - dodi al-fayed , son of millionaire - and owner of harrods - mohammed al-fayed . 
  you can probably guess from the previous two names i 've mentioned why that might be controversial . 
  basically , people say she was murdered because the royal family ( or their shadowy lizard overmasters ) did n't want our princes ( and * future kings * ) to have a muslim step brother ( or step son , in the case of charles ) . 
  that 's the biggest i can think of anyway . 
  do you see a chain on him ? 
  sadly he 's dead now , rip doggo . 
  that 's a bingo !, 
  how about the crushing progression of time ? 
  so it 's like fox hunting over here ? 
  will this do ? 
  funnily enough , the last time i went to the polski skelp - on your recommendation - i did buy some [ delicje !, 
  ] ( https://imgur.com/vhfarct ) they were very nice , i rate the raspberry ones as the better of the two  . 
  sadly , not long after that i moved house and the nearest one is well over an hour away . 
  so i ca n't get out there that much any more . 
  [ he 's only gone and done it . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/britishproblems/comments/5m73qd/walking_into_a_polish_shop_and_not_knowing_if/ ) you absolute mad man !, 
  i feel like i should point out that the ` cat ' in question is n't some furry companion . 
  it 's a reference to the cat o ' nine tails , a whip . 
  the saying literally translates to : this room is so small i could n't whip you . 
  it 's got its derogatory meaning here too , we 're just a bit more nuanced with our context . 
  same with faggot ; but less so because it 's inoffensive meaning ( a type of meatball ) is a bit antiquated and rarely used outside of old people ( who are , interestingly , least likley to use it in its derogatory way ) . 
  ** `` satire '' . 
  ** thanks to the internet , people seem to believe that satire is being a giant twat but not believing in why you say ( * even though you kind of do * ) . 
  the d , ed , and all those twattish subs * are n't satire * . 
  they 're just being cunts for the sake of it . 
  and anyway , claiming something is `` satire '' does n't exempt you from criticism - and certainly should n't be the reason behind shutting down discussion . 
  `` a modest proposal '' * was satire * . 
  it had are n't point to make and made it in a shocking way . 
  it prompted a discussion about societies treatment of the poor . 
  yelling `` niggerfaggot '' over and over * is n't satire * , there 's no thinking behind it and it prompts zero discussion . 
  if satire is not dead , we must kill it . 
  the word `` polish '' changes its meaning depending on if it 's first letter is capitalised . 
  polish shops are a bit of a minefield , i never know if i 'm going to leave with a can of pledge or a packet of kabanos . 
  also , in england , `` no '' can mean [ `` yes '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37799805 ) , depending on the context . 
  edit : another one is `` alright '' is both the question and it 's answer . 
   it 'll probably just be made into spyro only really works if your child is a dragon, 
   you should keep away from the terror targets like france , uk , germany . 
  instead look up safer countries like slovenia , nice try , slovenia tourist board . 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb and assume that `` be a finnish citizen '' and `` live in finland '' are two conditions that need to be met . 
  [ this illustrates it best ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/heroesjourney.svg/320px-heroesjourney.svg.png ) . 
  it 's a storytelling trope . 
  quite a few films follow the same ` journey ' , it 's why the first star trek remake is so similar to star wars ( and lord of the rings ), 
  isis is the most common , but is gets some use . 
  the bbc alway uses `` the so-called islamic state '' . 
  [ isis do n't seem to mind at all . 
  ] ( http://www.cracked.com/blog/isis-wants-us-to-invade-7-facts-revealed-by-their-magazine/ ) key quote :  * `` they even imitated the nusayriyyah and secularist opposition by labelling the islamic state as ` daesh ' and ` tandhim ad-dawlah , ' in a manner precisely mimicking the satellite channels and palace scholars of al salul and qat ... '' *, 
  are n't they just a samurai in space reenactment of the ` heroes journey ' ? 
  chips from the chinese takeaway are the best . 
  they fry them in the same oil they fry the spring rolls , so they taste all chinesey, 
  or my local chippy , depends on how far i 'm willing to drive . 
  naaaaah , it was [ totally merkel ] ( http://wordpress.mediatel.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/daily-express.jpg ) . 
  our press [ are level headded angels ] ( https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euobs-media/5e81495a6deca20598be6c1539aa69da.jpg ) , who would n't dream [ of misrepresenting information to spin an anti-eu bias ] ( http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/5763d41c15000030001b9ffc.png ), 
  * famous people who you `` grew up '' with will continue to die . 
  including the ones you * really do n't want to die * like david attenborough , stan lee , the queen , and the rest of the star wars cast . 
  * article 50 wo n't be triggered . 
  we 'll continue our dance while the economy crashes . 
  * theresa may continues to use `` paedophiles and terrorists ! '', 
  as a smokescreen to remove even more of our basic rights . 
  * tm declares herself queen . 
   marine le pen , frauke petry , nigel farage , geert wilders and norbert hofer all ride into the sunset on one of donald trump 's luxury yachts , they all exile themselves to a desert tropical island where , having given up politics , they practice free love and group sex and everyone lives happily ever after . 
  ... then we firebomb that island ? 
   - the uk bans something stupid because morals and children . 
  that 's cheating !, 
  just this year alone we tried to ban whipped cream and the laughter of children . 
  it 's becoming our `` thing '' . 
  we measure our car 's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon , but sell the petrol in liters . 
  not highschool but ... 
  when i was at uni , the appeal of spending a year out in an american college was to sleep with americans . 
  turns out you lot have a * bit * of a reputation for sleeping with anyone with an english accent .
