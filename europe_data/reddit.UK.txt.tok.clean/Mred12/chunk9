  london - big smoke is the only i can think of . 
  here 's the thing , one does not simply `` switch '' ireland to english . 
  why would you / s tag a serious post ? 
  we need the army of sealand to defend us . 
  we should vote that as our new flag design . 
  it 's perfect , that 's why . 
  you can even hear the woman shout `` leave it darren , he 's not worth it ! '' . 
  i do n't even need to say * which woman * , you just instinctively know . 
  generally , in the uk at least , we value teeth * being * healthy whereas the us tends to favour teeth * looking * healthy . 
  so teeth whitening is n't nearly as common , and anyone who does whiten their teeth is seen as a bit of a yankie-wannabe ponce and gets the piss taken out of them ( see : richard hamster ), 
   they were very cheap and the quality was also not that bad . 
  they may be cheap , but quality is not a primarni trait . 
  they 'll be in bits after a wash . 
  i 'm going out , but i 'm not going * out , out * . 
  so i 'll only have the one . 
  not the us , there 's 300 million of them there waiting to come over here , and we do n't know how many of them have guns . 
  it 's a security issue , you see . 
  also , somehow , it 's a stupider name than `` brexit '', 
  we are the 49 % !, 
  let 's not downplay his achievement . 
  a northerner being able to speak proper english is a big deal . 
  words , symbols , names , and moustaches . 
  what 's the difference between a dirty bus terminal and a lobster that 's had a boob job ? 
  * ones a crusty bus station , whilst the other 's a busty crustacean . 
  as i see it , they need to be more underdoggy . 
  like the sigmarines in aos . 
  they 're probably never going to move forward the 40k story , it 's been 10 minutes to midnight for the last 25 years . 
  for fantasy  aos they had to blow up the entire world ( and dimension ) and start from scratch . 
  to do similar to the * galaxy * would be a serous cataclysm . 
  that said , they could have a situation where the eye of terror fully opens and envelops the whole galaxy . 
  have the imperium on the back foot for a while . 
   b ) that leaving country ... the one that votes to leave all the time . 
  it 's ok , we 'll take our ball and go and play with turkey and poland . 
  the english channel and irish sea . 
  probably most popular here than anywhere else ( as others have said , gw is british ) , pretty much every city or large town has a gw store . 
  i collect aos chaos . 
  i 'll probably collect me some 40k once it gets end times 'd and aos 's . 
  if i get three wishes ? 
  * make everyone * chill the fuck out * . 
  * get rid of religion , it 's really not helping at this point ^ ^ ^ \\ #edgy * make me king for ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ extremely ^ ^ ^ long life . 
  i 'd like to believe the use of `` ay-rab '' negates the need for an s tag . 
  [ i do n't want to wait for our lives to be over , i want to know right now , what will it be ? 
  ] ( https://imgur.com/hqt0dp6 ) ... good to see james van der beek is keeping himself busy . 
  so , 2017 is the year that australia becomes a european country . 
  i 'm excited . 
   perhaps they were going for * gro\u00dfgermanisches reich * but thought that most viewers would n't be familiar with that term so they stuck the word * nazi * in there ? 
  you 'd think all the swastikas would clue them in though . 
  you can find a converted warehouse flatshare in the hackney area for around # 700pcm ( including most bills ) . 
  but when you 're looking ask got a summary of the lettings fees up front . 
  then brace yourself . 
  that said , there are places with a flat fee ( iirc purplebricks is # 95 ) . 
  it 's also worth looking for places outside of london ( eg winchester , southampton ) but you 'll have to factor in travel expenses . 
  i backed ouya on kickstarter . 
  that and i brought a 2016 vauxhall astra on finance . 
  not because it 's a bad car , it 's just that within 7 months of buying it i moved to london - which rendered it quite the albatross around my neck . 
  right in the tuppence !, 
   [ behold the # 1 note !, 
  ] ( http://gallery.hd.org/_exhibits/money/_more2003/_more06/uk-scotland-bank-note-green-one-pound-note-bank-of-scotland-1996-gbp-front-1-jr.jpg ) the only problem with that is you 'll need a scotsman to follow you around and say `` ah think you 'll find that 's * legal tender * '' to all the strippers . 
   the serious answer is that i 've only ever been to one `` gentleman 's club '' and it did n't have strippers . 
  instead , women circulated and asked if you wanted a lap dance , and if you did then you gave them # 10 and you went into a little cubicle and they did their thing . 
  i 've been to a couple of strip clubs , they all work basically the same as you said , but with some slight differences . 
  in the ones with a pole the girls take turns to dance on the pole in the centre on a stage . 
  the pole is more of a ` showroom ' , so they do n't take money there , it 's once they 're down they wander around and ask you if you want a ` private dance ' for 20 quid . 
   * black mirror * for the best tv programme . 
  i think he wanted * fictional * tv shows , not documentaries . 
  for `` as a european '' read `` as a non american '' . 
  if we do n't add in that clause it get assumed , by default , that we 're american . 
  i 'm guessing flat caps . 
  mostly because i 'm going out on a limb and assuming that op has just binge watched peaky blinders . 
   if you 're not wearing a pre-approved head covering ( bowler , top hat , flat cap , etc. . . ) being from the south coast , i 'm used to [ this ] ( http://ep.yimg.com/ay/hatstore/best-pirate-hat-6.jpg ) being my required hat . 
  then i moved to london , * boy !, 
  was my face red !, 
  * the strangest part was that they all assume ( based on my accent ) i should be wearing something like [ this ] ( http://www.hatsandcaps.co.uk/images/products/large/129004.jpg ), 
  wales voted leave, 
  does my oyster card work on the blowjob train ? 
  well , it 's not the big mic now , is it ? 
  i 've known people who had to get baptised before they could marry their partner , so it does happen . 
  although , i 'm not sure if that was due to pressures from the church or the family . 
  my girlfriend is turkish , me not being muslim has never been an issue . 
  of course , * she 's * also not a muslim - like many turks . 
  you might get a better response if you ask in one of the muslim-specific subreddits . 
  if you lot stopped changing your name for , like , 10 minutes people might visit and see if it 's beautiful . 
  london is * pretty ugly * . 
  not the places you 'd visit as a tourist - they 're beautiful and inspiring - but the places the average londoner lives . 
  ugly and expensive . 
  so ugly no one should move here . 
  in fact , if you already live here , you should move away . 
  live anywhere else . 
  i 'll bite the bullet and stay tho . 
  someone has to . 
  no love for hull ? 
  all you need is a change of vowel to get an accurate description . 
  also , it smells of farts . 
  bright red seems to be the other common ` unnatural ' hair colour . 
  be honest , it 's not the clothes that shouts `` american tourist '' , it 's the bumbag . 
  to me , turks are more mediterranean than arab . 
  i 'd be hard pressed to differentiate between a turk , a cypriot , and a greek ( on sight alone ) . 
  that said , my girlfriend is turkish , which might have changed my perception . 
  that episode of friends when the gang went to london . 
   in short , there wo n't be a pm farage any time soon .
