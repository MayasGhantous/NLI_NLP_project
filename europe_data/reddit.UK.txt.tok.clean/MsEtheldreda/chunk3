  if you think conscription is saving you from being invaded by a country with a military with manpower that numbers around half of the entire population of your country then i have some bad news for you ... 
  more proof that minions need to be banned !, 
  i live near birmingham . 
  large cities are not a problem for me . 
  its operated in kind of a weird way . 
  the state owns the rail network via network rail who do maintenance and stuff and the routes are franchised out to various private operators like first and virgin . 
  the state has its own operator & mdash ; directly operated railways & mdash ; who take over routes when they ca n't find someone to run the franchise who provide way better service than any of the private operators but do n't fit the privatisation agenda of the government . 
  what i 'd do if i was in charge is i 'd let the franchise contracts run out and give all of the routes to directly operated railways . 
  edit : one other thing its also probably worth noting is that when the railways were originally privatised management of the network was also privatised as railtrack . 
  they were plagued with problems and after the [ hatfield rail crash of 2000 which killed 4 people and injured over 70 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatfield_rail_crash ) was found to have been caused by railtrack shirking their maintenance duty it was renationalised to form network rail . 
  i recently went on a train trip with someone who has n't been on a train since british rail were around . 
  he was not impressed . 
  apparently the only thing that has changed is the ticket costs have shot up . 
  you may not like us very much but we can both agree that ni is insane . 
  i did say * most * of the north . 
  there are some nice bits . 
  gps are hit and miss depending on your area because they 're basically private doctors who are contracted to the nhs . 
  if you go to a hospital you should get good service though . 
  you only need to wait if you 're in for something non-critical because critical use takes priority . 
  if you need it right now you 'll get an appointment the same day . 
  you could probably apply that description to most of the north to be fair . 
  depends . 
  i 'm proud of bits like the fact we have the [ best ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s2g13st.jpg ) heathcare system in the world because thats awesome . 
  i 'm not proud of the fact that our politicians are cunts and people seem to act like we can do nothing wrong . 
  needs more eagles . 
  london . 
  its a rude , noisy , and overpopulated cesspool . 
  ca n't wait until climate change puts it under a few metres of water . 
   may our enemies drown in redtape !, 
  is n't that banned under the geneva protocol ? 
   he eu army can force the england to respect international law in terms of oil boundaries you mean the oil which is mostly in the shetlands who have said they would would secede from scotland to remain in the uk if scotland ever voted for independence ? 
  not to mention that oil prices have crashed since the referendum which makes scotland 's claim it can be financially independent even more dodgy . 
   the uk , france , germany and italy would likely bankroll the project which is why the uk are most against it . 
  [ yep . 
  we totally hate the eu . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#proposed_referendum_question_2015 ), 
  i 'd be in favour of more cooperation and alliances between the eu members but not a complete merger . 
  probably a troll account . 
  ignore it and it 'll go away . 
  i imagine you 're using an old os which does n't have emoji support . 
   come at me , putin . 
  its not like most of the world recognises it anyway . 
  you can also use an single - between your quotes like this :  baguette -  rockets, 
  [ ahem . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/cricket/33734800 ), 
  i think its more of a problem with aaa stuff and especially preorders . 
  i 've bought games before which were $ 10 cheaper before i turned my vpn off ( which exits in a eurozone country ) to buy them edit : theres currently a steam sale on . 
  that might be twisting the prices a bit . 
  is best country !, 
  which will mean that everyone in the uk will have to pay eurozone prices which are often much higher . 
  as if the $ to # price gouging was n't bad enough . 
  [ we brits were smart enough to keep our colonies but let them pretend to be independent .

  most americans think he was german . 
  meh , its a very small minority . 
  they do n't cause any trouble and if they did we could easily get rid of them . 
  as far as i 'm concerned less guns and patriotism is a good thing . 
  you 're very wrong . 
  there are 782 lords out of which 92 are still hereditary . 
   deported into one of us schengen countries ? 
  deported to the schengen country they came from . 
  every single reactor which has had a critical failure has failed because of user error or due to a design flaw due to being developed at a time when we did n't know very much about how they work . 
  modern reactors are much better designed and are able to initiate failover procedures without any human interaction . 
  this makes them extremely safe to operate . 
  in fact , if you compare it to others you will find that nuclear power generation kills less people per unit of energy generated than any other power source . 
  you know what we non-schengen countries can do though ? 
  check that people coming in are n't wanted criminals or people who have previously been deported . 
   considering the rate of desasters very uncommon and mostly with older reactor designs which are n't capable of turning themselves off automatically in case of failure ? 
  honestly i prefer our uncodified constitution to what the americans have . 
  just look at all of the problems they have because of the constitution being outdated but being impossible to amend because its so entrenched ( e.g. 
  they ca n't abolish the second amendment ) . 
   honestly youre preaching that the `` hereditary dictatorship '' of the house of lords is preferable to an absolute representative parliament , what you called `` electoral dictatorship '' it shows how little you know about the british political system when you do n't know that inheriting the right to be part of the house of lords was abolished literally 16 years ago . 
  i 'd like to see it stripped down by getting rid of people who rarely turn up , the remaining hereditary peers , and the lords spiritual . 
  then making it so that all new people who get appointed to it are from a diverse range of sectors but are all experts at the top of their fields . 
  i 've noticed lately that news sites like changing their titles after publication if they find something more likely to attract the readers attention . 
  so they have to become part of romania for three years then fuck off ? 
  providing you integrate and do n't go around being all muricaaaaa then i do n't have a problem with it . 
  same as with people from any other country . 
  i 'm amazed that support in the uk is so high . 
  that does n't change the fact that i know many gay men who have n't had any problems . 
  perhaps its just a london thing ? 
  people were n't very nice there in general last time i went down that way . 
  i 'm bi ( female ) and i 've never had any problems in the uk . 
  i know many gay people of both genders who have n't either . 
  * shrugs *, 
  i 'm 24 and in the uk and my parents are trying to convince me to * not * move out . 
  i 'm sorry , cuntitude is terminal . 
  i would n't really consider the us to be reasonable . 
  well , avoiding the mean ones and the shitty surrendering jokes ...  why do the french eat snails ? 
  because they do n't like fast food . 
  -  how many french people does it take to change a lightbulb ? 
  none . 
  they 're all too busy striking to do any work . 
  -  why was n't jesus born in france ? 
  because he could n't find three wise men or a virgin . 
  etc etc. 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ okay ^ ^ frenchies , ^ ^ we ^ ^ love ^ ^ you ^ ^ really . ~, 
  is best country !, 
   i was simply comparing to the death penalty ; which is still used in multiple `` reasonable '' first world country . 
  there are very few `` reasonable '' countries that use it .
