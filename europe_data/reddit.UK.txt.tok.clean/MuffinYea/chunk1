paris , too . 
  but many other english-speaking countries would then invest in ireland , aside from the financial industry . 
  exactly . 
  there 's something to deduce here . 
  i think london will be very badly hit , personally . 
  no one invests in the rest of the country so it 's almost business as usual for anyone north of chester . 
  there 's going to be quite the exodus in the city . 
  the problem is that politics * is * sensationalism . 
  someone raised it at the last pmqs , apparently most of westminster is n't interested in needing separate majorities . 
  as much as i like the idea , i do n't think it has a snowball 's chance in hell of materialising . 
  it 's not just scotland . 
  i think you 'd benefit from us leaving . 
  much of our trade , particularly in financial services , is attracted by the fact that we 're an english-speaking nation in the eu . 
  if we left , that would be you . 
   double plus interesting, 
  yes , they do . 
  because we 're in the eu , mostly . 
  the very highest of tiers . 
  one above god-tier . 
  hear hear, 
  no thanks m8 . 
  i 'm voting for cleggy , imperfect though he is . 
  sadly ( imo ) , often , yes . 
  and people say the lib dems do nothing . 
  good for them ( the lds ) , i say . 
  hopefully there 's no conservative majority government next year . 
  would n't really mind another coalition tbh . 
  could n't stand to have labour in either so rather have the ( very ) slightly more competent party in as a coalition with a partner who can block their more damaging policies . 
  and not a single tear was shed that day . 
  in france i believe it 's `` us '' and `` them '' . 
  i do n't like that : / . 
  i do n't want them dead , i want them back here , in court . 
  having said that , i ca n't say i will shed a tear if/when they are killed . 
  there are worse things that could happen . 
  if they ca n't even do our news properly , they have no chance with anyone else 's . 
  bored of tomatoes yet ? 
  * chews on sunday roast . 
  mush , or you 'll be speaking spanish by morning . 
  could you not make the same argument for using unrestrained military force in the middle east to crush isis in the name of humanity ? 
  what would be the difference ? 
  do you have a source for that ? 
   statistically whut, 
  british plugs are better than all other plugs : http://youtu.be/uefp1okkz_q, 
  singapore or the falklands . 
  welcome to the daily mail . 
   ~ ~ capitalism corporatism ~ ~ poorly applied capitalism, 
  yes , what else would i mean ? 
  sorry , i ca n't stand this guy . 
  the overtly american humour ( and language , occasionally ) makes me cringe , personally . 
  stewart can sometimes have a point and * sometimes * goes beyond the blindingly obvious , but this has no redeeming factors . 
  ` tis the season ... 
  [ yorkshire ? 
  ] ( http://britishcountyflags.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/insert-image-14-old-blue.jpg?w=640 ), 
  it looks so christmassy i do n't know what to think ... 
  `` liberal '' in the sense of traditional , classical liberalism would mean he 's opposed to govt action to increase social mobility . 
  what does it mean to be illiberal about race ? 
  since when did our politics involve racial policies ? 
  sounds fascist to me , ( and whatever boris is , that 's not it ) . 
  i do n't think it would win them an election alone but i do think it would mean a huge popularity boost for them . 
  true . 
  provided we do n't play you lot ... * crosses fingers * . 
  you 'd think so , the way they drink . 
  let me in, 
  guon cathy love, 
  a friend of mine went to thailand and says nothing tastes the same anymore and nothing is spicy ( except for some obscure indian food ) . 
  she was only there two weeks , but she must 've eaten a kilo of chilies . 
  i did n't understand until i had some hot and sour soup - *** oh my fuck *** that stuff is good . 
  my mouth waters at the very thought . 
  it 's ( sadly ) also quite shit . 
  we have a special relationship though . 
  if we were people , we 'd be lovers hate-fucking through the night . 
  i got a. . . uhh ... 
  bag of counterfeit penises here . 
  i do n't know of ( or have heard of ) anyone who regards us as more similar to the usa , personally . 
  the situation is bad over there , but i think it would be worse without our help . 
  cottage pie ... 
  fish and chips ... full roast ... steak and ale pie ... ploughman 's ... full english ... kippers ... bangers and mash ... 
  spotted dick ... waaatt plus ` foreign food ' in the uk has been here so long it is pretty much considered every bit as british as a melton mowbray at a derbyshire pub . 
  no sheffield ? 
  booooo . 
  please do not link to the daily mail . 
  do not give them the pageviews . 
  in many capitals , cars are nigh on useless .

  [ `` hurricane '' weather in sheffield today ] ( http://imgur.com/tgvvbpc ) ( read : `` same old drizzle '' ) . 
  that 's what murdoch does , especially in australia . 
  murdoch next pls . 
  he might not be quite so bad in comparison , but he 's still little more than evil incarnate . 
  little countries with few impressive churches like the vatican ? 
  you ca n't just do one per country . 
  some have a tonne of amazing ones . 
  nice guys are second , eh ? 
  how the fuck is the uk up there ? 
  i 've never had access to a connection  15mbps in my life - even temporarily .
