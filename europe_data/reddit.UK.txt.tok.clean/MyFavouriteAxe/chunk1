the islamic revolution was just as much a reactionary movement against westernisation ( and hence modernisation ) as it was about the tyranny of the shah , probably much more so . 
  the shah was an easy figure to hate ( if you are already sympathetic to the mullahs ) and hence provides fodder against which his enemies could rally in opposition . 
  i 've spoken to numerous iranians about this subject , most of them think that there would have been a similar religious coup eventually , regardless of what happened in 1953 , and i 'm inclined to believe them . 
  yes , a large part of the 1979 revolution was made up of leftists , but there were a ton of reactionary islamists which made it easy for them to monopolise the movement . 
  also their utter ruthlessness and complete unwillingness to share any power following the fall of the shah . 
  enough of the armchair history . 
  the iranians replaced the us/british puppet dictatorship with their own reactionary , theocratic authoritarian regime . 
  do you what khomeini did first ? 
  he relentlessly persecuted , tortured and executed members of the tudeh and other progressive parties . 
  mossaddegh 's national front was crushed too . 
  what one must realise is that this islamic cabal had as much or more contempt for the iranian democracy than they did for the dictatorship of the shah . 
  if you think that the cia coup is what led to the islamic revolution then you are very na\u00efve . 
  ayn rand was a complete idiot and a thoroughly repulsive human being . 
   the reasons why muslims are better integrated in the us than in europe are not well understood yet seems pretty obvious to me , the us has a great deal of discretion in choosing which muslims get in ; they tend to be highly skilled , well educated and , on the whole , relatively affluent . 
  some european countries , for example france and the uk , tend to get their muslim immigrants from their former colonies , wherein the bar has on the whole been lower than getting than for getting a green card . 
  we also get many refugee 's from conflicts in africa and the me , and the ones who ca n't afford to , or are otherwise ineligible for us immigration , plus those that the us turns down . 
  on top of this , there has always been a stream of illegal economic migrants from the islamic world ( which , after all , surrounds the med ) . 
  there are a lot of other factors at play but this one strikes me as the most relevant . 
   so you 're saying you 're ok with taking and assimilating skilled people leaving the source country brain drained ? 
  syria 's already brain drained ... 
  he was asking for it . 
   and you are being a bitch about it how so ? 
  we are n't turning them back ? 
  it 's not like europeans do n't have the right to object to this ; we have no obligation to take these people but we will anyway . 
  i 'll just point out that they are leaving turkey for a reason ... 
  turkey is taking refugees because they have no choice . 
  europe , on the other hand , is taking refugees for moral reasons . 
  no , the data does support their point . 
  approximately 50 % of syrian ** refugees ** are male - the vast majority of these people are being housed in refugee camps in turkey , jordan and lebanon . 
  a much greater percentage of the syrian ** refugees coming to europe ** are male , as the journey is arduous and they can apply for family reunification once their asylum is granted . 
  it makes far more sense when you think about it ; the women and children do n't have to make the sea crossings or deal with the other dangers involved in travelling that distance by land . 
  ah yes , the turks , renowned the world over for their tolerant attitudes and humane treatment of ethnic minorities and refugees . 
  look , ignore my previous replies ; i tend to be extremely curt and insensitive when i 'm drinking . 
  here 's the thing . 
  i do n't believe that there is anything special about europeans , white people or any other people for that matter . 
  we 're all more or less the same ( genetically ) . 
  however , i do think that something special happened in european history - that is we discovered that the best model for societies is built on consensual secular government , respect for the individual and a modern code of human rights . 
  it was n't easy and it was n't instant , but in the centuries following the scientific revolution and the enlightenment , these became the defining features of european civilisation . 
  no other societies have offered an alternative that is demonstrably better . 
  i do n't think that this had to happen to europe either but i 'm with jared diamond on this , a lot of geographic , historical and cultural reasons led to this taking hold specifically in europe . 
  it could , in theory , have happened anywhere else , but it did n't . 
  these are the values that any modern society must adopt , and ( this is very important ) europe , along with the other ` westernised ' states has emerged as the promoter of this modern civilisation . 
  is the western world perfect ? 
  no , and it does n't pretend to be . 
  but that does not make it the equivalent of the other civilisational models , in this respect i am not a relativist . 
  you seem determined to make any former world power pay for any atrocities it committed in its history . 
  how far back would you go ? 
  should we make italy pay france for what caesar did to the gauls ? ), 
  nearly every nation ( for lack of a better word ) has inflicted unspeakable suffering on another . 
  should they all have to make reparations ? 
  or do you only care about injustices committed in the last two centuries ? 
  you make comments like  then give them back every single piece of gold , every single slave , every great leader that your beautiful and oh-so advanced civilization murdered . 
  ignoring the fact that much of the imperial profits were reinvested in the colonies ( infrastructure in particular ) , and many colonials genuinely wanted to help . 
  never mind that britain was instrumental in putting a stop to slavery , a ** human institution ** as old as civilisation itself , that was readily embraced by every society , including the african tribes responsible for harvesting their cousins from the interior . 
  on this front , slavery persisted for much longer in south america than in did in europe and her colonies , and longer still in the islamic world . 
  why then should n't brazil , oman and turkey be paying reparations to african states they plundered for people ? 
  europe was almost solely responsible for stamping that out . 
   you yourself have done nothing of worth for your own civilization . 
  you 're taking credit from people long , long dead . 
  i 'm not trying to take credit for their accomplishments , in fact the further back you go , the more ashamed of their conduct i am . 
  however , i never said they were perfect and i refuse to concede that they were any worse than anyone else at the time . 
  please , enlighten me , who were these vastly more civilised people in the 1800 's ? 
  what i am , is proud of my cultural heritage , proud that my forebears ( in spite of all their faults ) were responsible for bequeathing to the world a hope for a better world , a hope that did n't exists before . 
  i completely agree re the post ww1 carving up of the middle east ; i wholly empathise with the plight of the kurds but that was a very different world and you can not blame people today for actions taken back then . 
  those were different people and it 's morally reprehensible to blame a child for the crimes of their parents . 
  the middle east has peculiar problems anyway , they can not be wholly attributed to the colonial legacy ( for which the ottomans also deserve some blame ) , it has to do with religion too . 
  those countries problems are ultimately inseparable from their religiosity , even the most fantastically wealthy and stable nations in that region ( gulf states ) have the most appalling records when it comes to human rights - they have an especially perverse form of legalised slavery , but i do n't see you railing against those crimes . 
  lastly , one important thing must be mentioned . 
  at the beginning of the age of discovery , and thereby the age of ( european ) imperialism , there was no centralised authority , all of those kingdoms were competing against each other . 
  did you really expect anyone with the means to not get involved ? 
  of course not , no other societies would have behaved any differently . 
  in particular , the british empire treated her foreign subjects demonstrably better than her european rivals , the spanish , belgians and french in particular . 
  we were just better at empire building than everyone else , which was simply a legacy of the napoleonic wars . 
  we also rapidly abandoned our empire ( in spite of domestic objection from massive entrenched interests ) voluntarily in the last century , what other people in history , given in our position would have ever done that ? 
  i grew up in a former british colony and in my experience the people there harboured no ill will towards the british ; all the roads , schools and hospitals had been built by them . 
  my parents immigrated to this country because it needed the skills they had and they wanted to help it develop , in doing so they left behind much more lucrative careers in the uk . 
  i spent 15 years living in africa , and for all the ills that continent suffered , it 's own people ( specifically obscenely corrupt ` democratically ' elected governments ) are largely responsible for their failure to achieve the progress that they are so obviously capable of . 
   people who might have a legitimate claim for asylum in the eu if they have a legitimate claim for asylum then they should be required to apply from the first safe country they reach . 
  this illegal border hopping and cramming people onto what only be called rafts needs to stop . 
  i personally think that david cameron 's approach is the right one to take ; we need to process legitimate refugees whilst they are still in countries such as turkey , lebanon , jordan , egypt , etc. . . and then , from there , ship them directly the eu states to which they have been assigned ( or to which they have applied ) , in proper ocean-going vessels . 
  this is the only way to stop the deaths at sea . 
  this needs a commitment from every eu country though , we must all share this burden , although i think that progressive quotas make the most sense . 
  that gives us the justification to turn back anyone who does not wait their turn and pursue asylum legally - there 's absolutely no reason we ca n't just tow boats back to turkey , it 's not a war zone and the turkish authorities are n't doing enough to stop them leaving . 
  if this sort of approach is n't implemented , i do n't see this ever ending . 
  there will always be conflict somewhere , and as long as we accept anyone who washes up on our shores , economic migrants and refugees alike will continue to exploit this dangerous and unsustainable path to european settlement . 
  the come across in the same boats , the two issues are inherently intertwined . 
  suppose assad agrees to an ultimatum , i.e. 
  to step down and hold elections . 
  that may well placate the free syrian army and some other rebels , but it has the potential to throw the army into disarray - that army is a very necessary component for crushing is ( who i do n't see backing down even if assad goes ) . 
  socialist is not the same as communist , and ( more importantly ) there is an enormous gulf between what your average socialist believes and soviet ( vanguard ) communism . 
  america 's behaviour in south america was disgusting , the pro capitalist regimes that they helped to install or prop up there were completely worthy of protest - that 's not unpatriotic . 
  i do n't think it 's likely that he will win , but that does n't mean that theres no point to his campaign - america is far too right wing . 
   but he is n't very intelligent the same can be said of a lot of us politicians . 
  have you looked at the republican primary , it 's a fucking disgrace . 
   most of the world forgets that the first victims of the islamist extremists were syrians . 
  of course , no one should ever forget this . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , what do you , as a syrian , think that we ( as the west ) are obligated to do then ? 
  this situation seems unable to resolve itself . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  thanks for replying .
