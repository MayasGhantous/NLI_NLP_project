  went to my gp that day and she gave me 2 options . 
  take a tiny sample and wait 3-5 days for the results or cut it out now . 
  15 minutes later i was done - it was cut out and sent off to be tested ( and it turned out not to be cancer ) total wait time without an appointment was about an hour . 
  total cost $ 0, 
  the charming muslim students at my university have turned the reflection room into the muslim prayer room and had everything from other religions removed . 
  in other universities muslim students run segerated meetings and events . 
  pools in many locations now have `` womens only times '' at the request of muslim groups . 
  my city is about to be enriched with our first muslim kindergarten , because as we all know the kuff\u0101r are evil and probably have cooties so it 's best for children being indocrinated into islam to never meet kuff\u0101r children . 
  my city has no primary/secondary muslim schools yet , but when the problems in english secondary schools are in the media , they are almost always single sex schools . . my university is also seeing a very noticable increase in women wearing the niqab . 
  as a man , the women wearing this would never speak to me , but the academics i speak to say they are locals , not non eu students . 
  what could possibly go wrong i wonder ? 
  just like is happening in many cities already :(, 
  it has been thoroughly debunked . 
  many many times . 
  religious fanatics have little time for rational thought , facts , reality etc, 
  and at that time many people in the us spoke german . 
  the feminists are also silent as german , swedish and finish schools tells the female students to stops wearing clothing that offends the invaders . 
  even gordon brown now says the vow has not been delivered . 
  angus robertson gave a list to david cameron this week . 
  9 % of scots feel the vow has been kept . 
  westminister can still abolish holyrood . 
  of course we were also told the best way to stay in the eu was to vote no . 
  also the powers offered in the `` vow '' are yet to happen . 
  and yet still the `` vow '' powers are not going to be met . 
  the trouble with the tax powers is the tax bands can not be altered , so either everyone pays more , or everyone pays less . 
  alex salmond made the once in a generation comment . 
  most unionists feel everything he says is a lie , apart from this one comment . 
  the last 2 polls for scotland independence puts it over the 50 % . 
  pro yes parties will dominate the holyrood election next year , and i can not see labour holding many councils the year after . 
  the other issue is many people with a uk passport have moved elsewhere in the eu and can not vote . 
  yup , 12 months ago politicans were swearing the only way to remain in the eu is to stay in the uk , and that looks set to change, 
  that 's the dream , 
  maybe he just wanted to live in a different country for a while . 
  the op worries are very similar to the worries some my colleges at work have . 
  im lucky that my gf is german so if ruk leaves the eu and scotland does not get to stay i can easily move elsewhere . 
  you also forgot that the woman are kuffars so suitable for being sex slaves etc. 
  as news of germany 's open doors spread the arrivals will increase . 
  also in sweden if your come from a country where it is not safe to send you back to , if when you are convicted of rape you are not deported . 
  across england there have been gangs of men who were allowed by the local authorities to get away with their crimes for years . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derby_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxford_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bristol_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telford_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peterborough_sex_abuse_case https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banbury_sex_gang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aylesbury_sex_gang etc etc etc etc, 
  did you read the article ? 
  this has more details : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal, 
  regardless of the newspaper it does not change the fact that the rape gangs exist , that the local governments did not act , and the targets of the gangs were young white , non muslim girls . 
  at d\u00fcsseldorf , the dissidenti are very left wing . 
  they spent most of last season at the other end of the stadium , after some troubles at the start of last season at an away game . 
  block 42 ( the main ultra group ) have never struck me as political . 
  definitely not right wing , but not hard left either . 
  there are a few antifa people in the curve , and a few neo nazis but in 54k stadium you are always going to get a few of both sides . 
  thank you for that well thought out reply . 
  from what i can see the left say welcome everyone and the hard right say we are full and noone is welcome . 
  any attempt to actual talk about cost , numbers , housing , etc seems to be totally pointless, 
  how many do you think sweden should take ? 
  100k a year ? 
  200k a year ? 
  500k a year ? 
  and once you leave australia rugby is rugby . 
  league is really unheard of . 
  the aussies are very rich because of an endless housing bubble . 
  when it pops it 's going to get very very bad over there . 
  reviews of the publishing records of climate researchers show `` support the tenets of acc outlined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change , and ( ii ) the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of acc are substantially below that of the convinced researchers . '', 
  http://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12107.abstract a 2009 paper shows similar numbers http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_doran_final.pdf sceptical science states a figure of 97 % is robust . 
  http://www.skepticalscience.com/97-percent-consensus-robust.htm and there are more summaries and links here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surveys_of_scientists%27_views_on_climate_change as with everything , if you have doubts about this number then you can always plan and conduct your own research , write it up and have it peer reviewed . 
  chris monckton ( fuck this `` lord '' shite ) disagrees with 98 % of the scientific community . 
  if he is so sure of his facts then he should debate scientists and publish his finding in peer reviewed journals . 
  if you stand on the left during rush time they will just stab you until you move to the right . 
  most people learn this very quickly . 
  we have never claimed it to be ` legal tender ' . 
  your notes are not ` legal tender ' here either : ) p you are just jealous you do n't have 3 banks printing 3 different sets of money for you to use , 
  if i lived in sweden i would be voting sd . 
  they are not the best party , but they are the party sweden needs . 
  they were far from impartial during the scottish referendum . 
  no they do not . 
  it 's good protection for users . 
  the fact that facebook thinks it is terrible does not make it terrible . 
  if we give you some money will you take it off our hands ? 
  please do n't think all of the uk is like this . 
  scotland did not vote tory but we have to live with the way england voted :(, 
  that said he does not get the salary for his rank ( colonel-in-chief ), 
  ignoring the lack of housing we already suffer with , not to mention it 's impossible to lower our carbon emissions if the population continues to increase ( also the possible anthropocene era , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthropocene ) there are other issue to consider . 
  norway figures show that each non-western immigrant costs the state $ 550,000 .

  i would like to use the euro ... 
  but i also enjoy the confused look on tourists faces when they work out there are 3 banks printing scottish notes . 
  i can only imagine how happy and tolerant europe will be when 10 % of the population is muslim . 
  the last thing europe needs is more religious nutters . 
  if the vote is to leave i doubt the `` uk '' will exist in a few years . 
  scotland will have another referendum and i suspect leaving the eu would increase support for a united ireland in northern ireland . 
  one carrier is going straight into long term storage , and the other will have no planes ... 
  same for the scottish referendum . 
  the over 60 's voted in major numbers and the vast majority for no :(, 
  dave is also silent on all the english/welsh/scots who now live elsewhere in the eu . 
  if you have ever lived in canberra you would not say that . 
  but canberra was designed over 100 years ago so we can learn from the mistakes . 
  thank you for making my point , 
  i 'm not really sure why worrying about levels of migration is always claimed to be a right wing position .
