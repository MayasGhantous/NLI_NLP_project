  i would call myself leftwing . 
  i support welfare . 
  i support national heath care , public services , lgbt rights etc. 
  i believe in evidence based policy . 
  the more i research the vast numbers of people wanting to leave africa , and the problems those already here bring with them , i do n't feel europe should be welcoming them . 
  what if our house only has 5 bedrooms , and there are 500 people also running away from the murderer ? 
  need to follow the australian model . 
  signs/advertising in the local country saying arrivals by boat will be sent back , dna recording of those who arrive by boat , speedy repatriations and then sink any remaining boats . 
  africa is in the middle of a massive population boom . 
  if we do n't act now and just keep accepting everyone who gets on a boat then very soon it will be 5,000 or 10,000 everyday . 
  i live in scotland and i will be voting snp . 
  i disagree with most/almost all of the ukip policies but i fully support electoral reform . 
  most people that i speak to who are politically active also want electoral reform . 
   the way that labour voters in scotland ( labour 's traditional heart-land ) have abandoned the labour party with such speed shows the difficulties that the labour party have . 
  it could also be said that the labour party have abandoned their voters . 
  in scotland the north british branch office of labour is dead . 
  they will be wiped out in the scotland elections next year and i can not see them controlling any councils either . 
  i also think the time is ripe of a right of centre pop scotland party to be formed . 
  it 's not a party i would support but i think they could do well . 
  my comment is really only valid for glasgow as it 's where i currently live . 
  during the referendum campaign the yes people were out in force on the streets . 
  street stalls , debates , public events etc. 
  it was frankly rare to see much support at all for no . 
  around 46 % of votes here were for no . 
  in the current westminster campaign the snp and the greens are out in force . 
  the labour party have a regular street stall on saturdays staffed by pensioners . 
  where i live used to be a labour stronghold but now they can not get enough people to leaflet for them so they pay royal mail . 
  the snp and the greens have 100 's of members and they are out and about . 
  the younger people will not be automatically pro-independence , but the unionist parties certainly seem to have lost the younger vote , and are struggling to be active parties for the coming election . 
  if you are under 40 and live in glasgow it seems to be very hard to find a reason to support labour at the moment . 
  the tories and the libdems are toxic . 
  well lets see , the holocaust happened and there is a mountain of evidence that it happened . 
  islamophobia on the other hand is a madeup word designed to silence criticism of a backwards , dark ages political/religious system . 
  the 2 should never be compared . 
  lets look at some of the other new rules `` it is not ok to suggest that some races or cultures are inherently better than others . '', 
  so really , i can not say europe is far better to live in than saudi arabia ? 
  actually i really can not be bothered saying much more . 
  if the mods are happy in their perfect little bubble then there is no chance of changing their minds . 
  when did tumblr sjws start running / europe ? 
  scotland ftw , 
  http://www.henningwehn.de/ : ) p but yes i get your point, 
  yup . 
  if scotland was separate we would be close to our targets . 
  bernie sanders would be proud of that queue, 
  because of his strand of islam he is also considered an apostate and death is a suitable punishment for that in islam . 
  the murder happened in glasgow and as we also learnt on the weekend , the head iman at the mosque is a wahhabi . 
  he taught in private that the murder of salmaan taseer was a just act . 
  i grew up in australia and it 's clear that this was filmed in sydney and thus faked . 
  sweden is a country full of peaceful people who would never attack the media like this . 
  perhaps you could provide some statics as to why he is wrong ? 
  he sites university published research . 
   real footbal , real fans we are talking about the epl , not the bundesliga, 
  sweden currently has a worse teenager gender balance than china . 
  ( 120 boys for every 100 girls ) . 
  any society with more than 105/100 slowly becomes more violent . 
  it 's going to be a great future for your children, 
  austria says it will only allow 1.16 million migrants into the country this year and this upsets the eu ?? 
  i 'm going to assume you invested the money you stole , and after 20 years you are living off it , 
  parts of it are being updated . 
  but as the public transport is utter crap in glasgow we now have 2 incompatible `` smart '' cards , most people still use paper tickets and depending on where you buy them , the paper tickets will not work in the barriers at train stations . 
  and if you want to use the subway after 18:00 on sunday do n't bother . 
  it 's closed . 
   first majority muslim city in the eu brussels will be there first i believe, 
  how so ? 
   can you imagine ~ ~ if ~ ~ ** when ** he gets elected ? 
  ftfy , 
  do n't shatter my safespace !, 
  i built my home out of cardboard from munchie boxes , 
  i am the only one wondering why you would use `` sie '' when you are naked ? 
  you are forgetting about the trauma the arab neighbour suffered getting arrested . 
  that would not happen in the middle east . 
  yes . 
  tower hamlets in london . 
  muslim majority . 
  corrupt mayor . 
  electoral fraud .

  i think this also needs to be thought about for sweden and the rest of europe https://twitter.com/hansrosling/status/669678035654852608, 
  if we were getting americani ** s ** ed  i would be off to a gun store this week to make several purchases . 
  swedish women will have a lot of these worries in the near future https://twitter.com/hansrosling/status/669678035654852608, 
  * england * not britain . 
  scotland , wales and northern ireland are not fucking over our doctors . 
  it has nothing to do with schengen . 
  break many laws , put others at risk of death and get rewarded . 
  it 's a joke and will only encourage others to do the same . 
  he should be deported to the first safe country he arrived in . 
  wow . 
  i knew it was bad but not that bad in nigeria, 
  this always amazes me about belgium . 
  my german is decent and my dutch is well a1/basic but when i am in belgium the number of french speakers who claim to speak no english + german or dutch is amazing . 
  it 's because hungary has it 's shit together and we thank you for that , 
  well given that the population of africa is growing and shows no signs of slowing down , and given that the middle east and will probably always be a disaster we either need to fix the laws to protect europe or just open the doors . 
  there is no other option . 
  the 1984 ethiopa had a population of 40 when the famine happened . 
  the current population is 95-97 million depending on the souce . 
  this population growth has been mirrored across almost all of africa . 
  a zero hours contract does not give you that power . 
  you get to work when you are told to work , not when you actually have time . 
  also moany say you should not take work elsewhere . 
  lets see , we currently have a massive housing crisis , zero hours jobs are all that is offered , families need food banks just to exist , our services are falling apart due to endless cuts ( our government spending to gdp is on track to be lower than the usa ) most people will no longer live long enough to see the pension , the health servce is being sold off but yes , somehow we have a strong economy .
