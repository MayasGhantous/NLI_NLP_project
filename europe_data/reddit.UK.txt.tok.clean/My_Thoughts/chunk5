  when you annex east anglia i trust you will be fine with us declaring independence , 
  wow . 
  where i live the hijab seems to be become normal for muslim girls at about 8-10 . 
  i believe 19 minutes after the result is declared civil war will erupt across france . 
  the following morning the war will have spread across europe . 
  within a week france will be a destroyed nation in need of un peacekeepers . 
  if you have ever been to luton you would not be wondering what background these people are from . 
  what you are suggesting is good but there are easier things to start with . 
  one might be to ask why so many european muslims feel death is the suitable punishment for leaving islam . 
  until these sorts of views are no longer held by the muslim community not is really going to change . 
  the voting system used for westminister means most peoples votes are pointless . 
  this leads to low turnouts . 
  given the ongoing cuts to funding , most police services would be unable to respond within 10 minutes these days :(, 
  thanks , 
  i thought there might be a less english word for pop-corn in french , 
  well westminster elections and english council elections still use first past the post , so in any election many peoples votes just do n't count . 
  many people seems fine with this . 
  and yet so often when people use facts to show just how big the population problem in going to become in out life times , many people just do n't want to hear it, 
  not all isps will be doing this http://www.revk.uk/2015/10/no-we-will-not-be-logging-your-search.html, 
  he has not been sentenced yet , but going on what other criminals get in sweden , 10 years is about how long he will be sentenced to . 
  he will not be fully released until they decide he wo n't do it again and then he will get a nice appartment , a social worker and governent handouts for life . 
  two months ago sweden tried to deport a man to itlay . 
  he respones was to kill 2 people in ikea because they looked swedish . 
  he will now spend ~ 10 years in a swedish jail and then get to live in sweden for the rest of his life as he can not be deported to africa under swedish law . 
  i have no idea what these migrants are going to do when they arrive in the uk . 
  even if they are found a house ( which just does not exist ) it 's going to be not what they expect . 
  rents are sky high so the government will have to play a private landlord to house them . 
  unemployment benfits are very low and they will struggle to ever get into the work force . 
  the horrible reality is there are either going to end up homeless here , or keep current citizens homeless . 
  i live in scotland and my friends and the people i work with are in their late 20 's and 30 's . 
  we struggle to afford to buy a flat , unemplyment is high , our social safety net is being reduced . 
  friends with masters degrees are lucky to get a part time job in a supermarket . 
  there are weekly stories in the media about thousands of families needing foodbanks just to have food to eat each week . 
  20 % of scottish children live in poverty . 
  there are almost no new social houses being built so homeless numbers rise each month . 
  the support the government should be giving to it 's citizens has been cut and cut and cut . 
  very soon even those with terminal cancer will have to look for work each week just to get government support . 
  but yes , lets bring in thousands of people who can not speak english , have no reconised qualification and nowhere to live . 
  as long as they understand they there are no houses left , there is no governemnt supports and it 's doubtful many of them will ever find a job everything should be fine . 
  the only real upside is our scottish government is doing all that it can to shield us from the westminster cuts . 
  things are worse for the english :(, 
  i have never seen any evidence that the eu does this . 
  impound and sink the dinghy , arrest the crew . 
  impound and sink the boat , put the crew in prison . 
  do that as standard and the flow is slowed a lot . 
  it is impossible for us to have any hope of cutting our carbon output with a rising population . 
  well decent affordable housing would be good start . 
  bring on 2016 and the glorious future for europe , 
  many of us are wondering the same thing :(, 
  thank you ,

  i 'm lucky enough to spend 4-6 weeks in the netherlands & germany each year . 
  the housing , infrastructure , standard of living in many cities is so far behind it 's ridiculous . 
  being in the eu is not the problem , it 's the endless useless short-sighted governments . 
  yes in jail , but he will get to live in sweden for the rest of his life now as italy will not take him and sweden will not send him back to africa . 
  as africa develops , more people will want to leave https://flipchartfairytales.wordpress.com/2015/08/06/africa-is-getting-richer-so-expect-more-migrants/,

  sweden tried to deport a man to italy last month . 
  he went to ikea and killed 2 people and is now going to remain in sweden . 
  bradford , inbreeding is a massive problem http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8544359/hay-festival-2011-professor-risks-political-storm-over-muslim-inbreeding.html, 
  it had already happened when i started here . 
  most muslim student associations in the uk are now hardline . 
  queen margaret in london and several other london universities have massive problems with their muslim associations . 
  holden is separate and still part of gm however due to many changes their australian market share has fallen from ~ 20 % to ~ 10 % in recent years and with the new gm direction that share will probably continue to fall . 
  almost none, 
  i would be very interesting in hearing how avis unfair . 
  i would also be interested in hearing how numbering a series of boxes from 1 to however many the voter likes is overly complicated . 
  ginger muslims are all about the love and tolerance https://www.google.co.uk/#hl=en&amp;biw=1073&amp;bih=724&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=jamaal+uddin+&amp;oq=jamaal+uddin+&amp;gs_l=hp.12..0j0i10i30l2j0i5i30.2162.2162.0.3721.1.1.0.0.0.0.89.89.1.1.0.les%3b..0.0...1c.ary-nlekqdi&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=3320033cfdaf4959&amp;bpcl=38625945, 
  i have worked in a number of universities in australia and the eu over the last 15 + years . 
  most of this at high ranked research universities . 
  in a lot of fields ideas and standards change quickly , and access to worldwide research is important . 
  ignoring the translation costs ( and time ) , when students and academics exchange ideas they want to be able to communicate and this is a major factor in english becoming the standard academic language . 
  this is taken a step further in it . 
  many certification exams for example are only available in english and japanese . 
  if someone from france wants to sit a high level cisco exam they will need to read english . 
  if you work on dedicated networking harware such as routers and firewalls the only language option in the command line is english ( though you really dont need a lot to get by with it ) i dont think this is fair but its the way it is . 
  i know a lot of universities that teach in english in non english speaking eu countries will not let a student graduate until they have passed the b2 language exam for the local language . 
  i support this and wish universities in scotland and england would require all their students to do some language study as well . 
  the question is `` country of residence where you live right now '', 
  the question asks `` country of residence * where you live right now '' the passport question is a different question, 
  the country i live in is scotland but i can not select that :(, 
  every time the england parliament issue comes up in scotland everyone i know ( either pro/anti or meah about independence ) feels england should have it 's own parliament . 
  if there was a real push for that i dont know any scot who would object . 
  easy fix is for ruk to also join schengen : ) p, 
  scotland can export energy to england . 
  scotland already has a hvdc link to northern ireland so the irish energy market is available . 
  there is a hvdc link between norway and scotland being built and norway has links to denmark , sweden and a direct link to germany . 
  renewable energy can be moved around europe and scotland is expanding renewables . 
  yes . 
  having lived in both london and scotland my experience is the scottish feel far closer to the rest of europe than the south east of england does . 
  i just wish the stats seperated england/scotland/wales / ni, 
  very well said, 
  people have been taught in metric for years . 
  it really is time to finish this change, 
  if you are an eu citizen you can vote in eu elections in the country you live in . 
  your host country might also give you more voting right such as local council elections . 
  this should be as successful as the 60 + year war on drugs, 
  they probably were born in france . 
  their parents or grandparents moved to a better place for a better life . 
  and now a few of the current generation hold ideas that are not compatable with the open liberal secular society western europe has become .
