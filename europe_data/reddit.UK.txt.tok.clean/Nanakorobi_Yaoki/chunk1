** lets be clear before i answer you here ; the logic that poland is unreliable because of it 's failure is your own logic thrown back in your face , it is not my actual opinion . 
  **  try to be a country between germany and russia and then we can talk . 
  the uk is an island , so it built a navy larger than the next two largest navy 's combines . 
  poland has borders with the ussr and germany so it ...  speaking of failing , do n't forget who was fighting in raf in the battle of britain . 
  polish pilots doing well in the raf does n't really make up for the non existence of the polish armed forces . 
   how reliable the uk and france are we know from ww2 oh man , i know i mean we only sacked our entire empire , position on the world stage and economy defeating the nazi 's for you , then engaged in 100 years of cold war to collapse the empire occupying you . 
  and lets not forget the warsaw uprising where the british sent aid without soviet air clearance whilst the us waited until it had soviet air clearance . 
  if we are unreliable for failing to liberate poland against nazi germany and the ussr , then you are even more unreliable for failing to hold your own country for longer than 1 month and 5 days . 
  leaving the uk as the only country in europe not conquered . 
   the only people who mentioned ww3 were the leave campaign . 
  david cameron , who is of the remain campaign , said leaving would make ww3 more likely . 
   it was ours . 
  there was no disagreement , it was ours , now it 's theirs . 
  again , i do n't know where you are from and you hav n't provided a source so i have no idea about the veracity of your claims . 
   i see you are from wales : the union used to give you 500 million pounds for your businesses and other projects you wo n't receive in the upcoming future . 
  how do you call that ? 
  the uk was a net contributor . 
  this did not negatively effect any other part of the eu . 
   why would you want constraints on the freedom of movement ? 
  to stop our working class beginning a revolution . 
  to allow us to plan for the number of migrants coming each year and thus curtail the housing and public service crisis . 
   we got an opt out of closer integration . 
  trying to paper over the cracks does n't remove the cracks . 
   we will now lose are international status and economic standing because people felt the eu caused all their problems . 
  that has yet to be seen . 
  they are also not the most important things in the world . 
  you 've no flair so i do n't know whos sea you are talking about . 
  under international law was it strictly speaking your sea or was this the resolution of a disagreement ? 
   if you say a european unity is a joke , you 're inherently saying that the european union is a joke , since it is what it is : the unity of european countries . 
  it 's not hard to understand . 
  you 're missing the nuance behind the word unity . 
  show me when an eu member state has taken an action for the benefit of another eu member state that was harmful to itself . 
  so if you know the difference why do you persist in denying it ? 
  if something changes then an action is taken . 
  either way , your distinction makes no actual difference other than phrasing ? 
   so , you 're saying that i make shit up even if you call the eu a joke ? 
  and that 's not belittling ? 
  i 'm not sure if you are purposefully being an idiot or if english is n't your first language and you are simply confused . 
  i said european ** unity ** is a joke . 
  not the european ** union ** . 
  in either case , neither is belittling to you , an individual . 
   enjoy summer in england england , lul  btw , how many languages can you speak with those awful yellow teeth of yours ? 
  tell me . 
  i can speak 6 , including yours better than you , apparently . 
  and again , the federalists approach to difference of opinion shows itself . 
  just to emphasize : # ** unity ** is a different word to ** union ** . 
  more power given to the parliament . 
  constraints on freedom of movement for situations where it is heavily one-sided , large numbers . 
  2-tier europe so the federalists can further federalize and the rest can at a slower pace . 
  for a start . 
  any action against british expats will be met with action against eu expats . 
  the balance heavily favours the uk in that case . 
  most likely is those already in the uk or eu will not face retrospective changes to their rights only those moving after the exit . 
  i would think . 
  edit : i get it , you 're all really angry that we decided to leave you but you do n't have a valid reason to disagree with me so you 're going to wrap it up in a semantics point over the word ` action ' . 
  be honest with yourself , downvote for hate , not for semantics . 
   i 'm not the one calling the entire eu a `` joke '' and here we see the next argument of the european federalist ; to make shit up . 
  i said european unity is a joke , without unity no federal state can be made . 
  unity takes time to build whereas the federalists rush ahead ignoring the problems that arise , hoping against hope that if they can just reach that end destination all the problems will magically disappear . 
  another demonstration of your typical federalist response . 
  meet opposition ? 
  ignore it , ca n't ignore it ? 
  belittle it . 
  you are the enemy of europe . 
   i 'm not talking about that . 
  i 'm talking about this . 
  the eu 's inability to spot a blatant crisis and be flexibile in the face of it ? 
  yes , thankyou for a source . 
   not accepting the euro being at the top of the list . 
  we are not the only ones who did not accept the euro . 
  we told you the euro was a bad idea , low-and-behold the euro was a bad idea . 
   we 're waiting for you to invoke art . 
  just do that already , so we can go on with all the serious advancements you 've hindered for more than 40 years . 
  as i said , the blind federalists . 
  you 'll tear the rest of the eu apart before you 're satisfied . 
  keep the blinkers on tight . 
  difficult ? 
  more like impossible . 
  another myth . 
  the uk follows eu regulations and laws much better than many other members . 
  when we have opposed the german-franco bloc we 've often done so with the support of other eu nations . 
  the eu is a bloc of federalists who ignore everyone else and everyone else who is just out for themselves . 
  european unity is a joke . 
  i understand the benefits of the eu perfectly , i also know it needs to be reformed and every statement by europeans , the establishment and camerons negotiation points to that being impossible . 
  corbyn was honest about the faults but believed they could be reformed . 
   you do realize that you 've blown 2000 billion dollars in less than two hours after the referendum and that we 're not willing to waste any more money because of your shit , right ? 
  should n't have told cameron to fuck off when he came for his ` renegotiation ' then , eh . 
  yes , i voted leave . 
  the only two times the remain campaign swayed me were corbyns interview and the hungarian advert . 
  a few remain redditors also swayed me towards spoiling my ballot . 
  in the end it was a close decision that leave won out on . 
  it 's the height of irony that only in the shock of us voting leave has discussion of the changes i would have voted remain for become serious discussions . 
  whereas to me corbyn was one of the only remainers who almost swayed me . 
  tfw you realize you 're an idiot . 
  my bad . 
  i meant leave . 
  looks like brexit civil war is happening . 
  do you genuinly not know how fractions , percentages and maths in general work ? 
  0.21 is 21 % , it 's 4 % lower than 1/4 , for ease of writing 1/4 is a good approximation . 
   but yet again , there will be fewer and fewer low skilled jobs , and that will inevitably continue to happen regardless of immigration or not , because of automation .
