  ** the leave campaign have very explicitly ** not ** said that # 350m will go into the nhs . 
   between muslim extremists and right wing extremists according to europol leftwing terrorism far outweighs right wing terrorism . 
  i know reading comprehension is a problem for neo-barbs like yourself . 
  let me help you out : in the context of this conversation , where we both know the origins of any money sent to the eu , the question :  i did - now tell me where you get 350mn from ? 
  is clearly asking , where the exact figure comes from . 
  my answer :  the ifs is an answer to who has calculated this figure , not the origins of the money . 
  i hope this english lesson has helped you , further lessons will cost i 'm afraid . 
   i did - now tell me where you get 350mn from ? 
  the ifs ** trust the experts **  qed - now close the door when you leave today ;-) i totally did nazi that coming . 
  have a nice eurocrisis , catch ya later . 
   no it 's not correct - you do not have 350mn to put into the nhs after `` voting leave '' ( let aside the fact that even the smallest trade agreement would cost money ) http://leftfootforward.org/images/2016/05/rsz_cikhd7axaaiklxc.jpg read the fucking bus . 
  ` lets fund our nhs instead . ', 
  the bus is misleading , not incorrect . 
  everyone who has been watching the leave campaign knows this is their modus operandi . 
   i do not see how the average `` leave voter '' is intellectually capable to distinguish these descriptions - let alone wants to distnguish it ... dae working class stuped  and saying `` we could put all the money towards the nhs '' shows this very obviously ... there just would not be 350m pounds to `` put somewhere else '' . 
  it 's misleading not incorrect . 
   and while we are at it ... whats that `` magic ingredient '' . 
  you think somehow the european council/parliament comes together and says : * `` let 's see who 's got a majority ? 
  oh the uk has ... now we just wave the magic stick and suddenly the `` economic power '' devalues your majority - bad luck for you uk ! '' . 
  you 're naivety is kind of cute . 
   as long as mr.farage does not attend at eg fishery quota negotiations as a member of the european parliament , but afterwards cries about the outcome , i wonder how more spoiled the majority of england could get . 
  you do n't understand what a protest vote is . 
  are you jon snow ? 
  http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-send-350m-week-brussels/22804 as the ifs say , using the # 350m figure is ` not sensible ' not ` not technically correct ' . 
  ** trust the experts **, 
   it 's not 50 % of leave ; it 's 50 % of all voters : source ? 
   a poll shows . 
  link the poll , or do you already know it 's not reliable ? 
   so far i did provide evidence of 50 % of the british eloctorate basic math lesson for you here . 
  you say that 50 % of leave voters believe the # 350 figure . 
  leave is 50 % of the population . 
  whats 50 % of 50 % ? 
  stupid . 
   clearly not understanding how much the uk pays towards europe ( = being stupid ) , the only dubious part of the # 350m statement is the use of the word * send * as we are already discussing in another comment chain . 
   which is inherently impossible due to veto-rights ... because economic pressure does n't exist . 
  it 's no secret where the rebate is calculated . 
  it 's not westminster . 
  ok , obviously there has been a misunderstanding of what '' means . 
   we ` send ' # 350m send is written as ` send ' because we do n't really send it , but at the same time we do n't control the reduction , so there is a pass-over of control , so in a sense we are sending # 350m . 
  so yes , thanks for reiterating what i just said . 
  tfw german calls people stupid ; thinks brexit means the uk leaves the continent of europe . 
  no , i hav n't voted yet . 
  i am still deciding . 
  the remain campaign might be utter cunts and this forum would indicate the same about many europeans but there is more to the decision than that , eh . 
  the rebate is not controlled by westminster . 
  we ` send ' # 350m , this is then reduced by the rebate and then we get some back to spend as the eu says . 
  so what we control is the # 350m . 
  in farages last speech though you will note he chose to go with the lower figure . 
  saying # 34m a day , whereas the # 350m is # 55m a day . 
  ah yes , any descent from the chaotic path the eu has chosen time and time again under the leader ship of germany and france is but the entitlement of a demanding toddler . 
  will each side get a funky name ? 
  this attitude that is so prevalent is how we have arrived at this point . 
   still a pretty strong majority of economists who think that brexit will lower british gdp forever by a considerable amount . 
  this is not the economic consensus , the models do not predict that . 
  ** listen to the experts **, 
   agricultural subsidies are very normal dude , they serve an important purpose . 
  yes , to discriminate against developing markets in some vain hope of maintaining supremacy . 
   oh please . 
  almost every other rich-world country subsidises their agriculture . 
  you can see for yourself that , for the rich world , the eu has one of the lowest pse 's ( essentially how much of a farms income comes from subsidies ) . 
  the eu is subsidizing higher than any of the ones i 'd consider morally comparable and by substantial amount . 
  ( from your own source ) . 
  12 % more than the us . 
  16 % more than australia . 
  5 % more than canada . 
  18 % more than new zealand . 
   the statements he made makes it seem as if the eu is shutting out africa , and building up walls to keep agriculture purely for europeans . 
  yes , and it is . 
   food security . 
  invest in modernizing the agriculture industry to make it competitive then , instead of artificially excluding competition . 
   rural development . 
  as i said , propping up un competitive industries . 
  keep doing it by all means , eventually your going to force a thatcher to come along and tear it all down and then it 'll be 10x worse than it could have been . 
   environmental sustainability . 
  a good deal of europe 's agricultural produce is economically profitable . 
  the problem is , some of this is in environmentally sensitive areas - witness water stressed areas of spain/italy , or it is n't environmentally friendly . 
  to this end , the eu helps our farmers that might otherwise have the freedom to damage the long term viability of land , but do n't want to with assistance . 
  furthermore , large swathes of the amazon are already being cut down to support europe 's addiction to beef . 
  should we now encourage this trend in africa as well ? 
  so now you argue that africans do n't deserve agency over their own decisions ? 
   food quality . 
  market forces will give superior product an edge . 
  39 % of the budget being spent on 5 % of the people , primarily in non-uk nations and contributing to the forcing out of the market of developing nations in africa , all to prop up failing european agriculture . 
  we 'll stop having to have our contribution rebalanced when they stop spending so unfairly . 
  anyhow the uk rebate was cut by 40 % under tony blair for promises of cap reform that never came . 
   if you want to claim something is wrong , you 're the one who has to prove it . 
  seems obvious no . 
  basic common sense dictates that you are wrong . 
   when two parties are in a discussion and one asserts a claim that the other disputes , the one who asserts has a burden of proof to justify or substantiate that claim  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophic_burden_of_proof, 
  9/10 people quoting this experts melark hav n't even looked at what the experts agree on . 
  the experts are in consensus about short term economic recession . 
  they are not in consensus about long term economic possibilities or about the likelyhood of the four horsemen of the apocalypse turning up . 
  the us has always followed it 's own interests with regards to the uk . 
  the opinion of the us president is by no means impartial . 
  so cameron wo n't be voting ? 
   farage called him the ` most anti-british us president ever ' of the modern presidents he and his establishment are by far . 
  the ones who were president when we were at war with the us in the past probably take the # 1 spot though . 
  hello , thanks for doing this ama . 
  tony blair traded a large part of our rebate for the promise of cap reform . 
  this promise has not been kept .
