  ** how , if we vote remain , do we hold the eu accountable to its promises ? 
  ** it seems to me the french and others self-interest means democratic accountability is useless in this instance . 
  in the event of a remain , ** what do you envision our role in the refugee crisis to be ? 
  ** ee ( and admittedly the uk ) have been far too unwilling to compromise whereas germany and sweden have gone too far the other way . 
  this impasse seems to be the perfect opportunity for a uk government to make some difference in europe if it walks the middle road . 
  if the pm had come back from his renegotiation with even token reform and promises of more , remain would be winning by a landslide . 
  ** in the face of the eu 's unwillingness to reform , how do you propose we go about reforming it ? 
  or do you support the eu in its current form ? 
  lobbying and all . 
  ** and as a last question ; ** i 'd ask how you think both campaigns have behaved during this referendum ? 
  ** i think the opinion of the british public on this question is unanimous . 
  nice conversation we are having here , it 's good to see your barbaric country finally using the civilized tongue . 
  remain or stay , frances economy will come crashing down with the cap . 
  so you 're trolling ? 
  making the rest of europe pay to keep your shitty agriculture industry alive is special treatment . 
  if it 's not then the uk is not receiving special treatment either , it is just negotiation a better position . 
   you really think we should put more weight in someone 's underbelly opinion who has no expert knowledge of a series of very complicated fields over that of people who studied and worked years on it ? 
  people have a right to choose their fate . 
  economics as a social science is absolutely terrible at predicting long term economic effects . 
  the only economic consensus is that we will probably go into a short term small recession after a brexit . 
   do you also assume this position in other aspects ? 
  like evolution , climate change , etc. 
  you are comparing apples to oranges . 
  evolution is looking at the past , not predicting the future . 
  climate change is looking at the past and making predictions based on trends . 
  - economists do not have very much past to look at for the scenario we are talking about . 
  - leaving or remaining in the eu is about more than economics , none of the realistic arguments involve the arrival of the 4 horsemen . 
  the only thing remain does by constantly looking down their noses at the working class is to further isolate them and entrench their position . 
   but those brexiters and those eurosceptics that want special treatment for everything -  france -  cap, 
   they already tried that ? 
  well maybe they should try again , and try a bit fucking harder , rather than ass-raping 49 % of their countrymen . 
  if the eu had given even a token of real reform to cameron this referendum would be a remain landslide . 
  yes . 
  next question ? 
  that 's a yes , right ? 
  same in some parts of wales does n't have the same ring to it . 
   nope . 
  nope . 
  nope . 
  brexit is a right-wing project and will harm the working class . 
  that you consider the working class to have no agency and to be too stupid to vote says more about you than it does about brexit . 
   [ current year ] replaces all documented migration patterns , got it . 
  documented migration patterns ? 
  from when ? 
  100 years ago we were fucking at war or had conquered half the world , shortly after we joined the eu . 
  there has never been a global open door so the existence of this so called documented migration pattern is clearly farcical . 
   do n't pretend brexit will change anything about this when the leave campaign is full of blatantly racist fearmongering . 
  the remain camp are the ones in power , the leave camp wo n't gain power just because they won a referendum , especially when both campaigns are made up of multiple parties . 
  a leave vote is likely to re-balance the scales somewhat . 
  not to the level that i would like , but anything is better than nothing . 
   are you confusing the rebate with the # 6bn that the eu spends in the uk ? 
  as i think we can agree on the technicality of this ( i take ) then i will ignore it in my next to try keep my point straight forward ( just concerning the rebate ) . 
   i 'm also curious about what effectively means in that context , but i do n't see why you infer that it means that money is sent to to the eu and then sent back again . 
  it clearly says it is not sent at all . 
  it 's a case of thinking about it in terms of westminster and the eu , and the control each has . 
  westminster has to give # 350m to the eu . 
  the eu then says , ok you have the rebate , reduce that by x. 
  the control that westminster has here , is to send the # 350m . 
  it is the eu that reduces it , not westminster . 
  so ... is putting flags on foreign clay allowed again ? 
  [ just asking , no reason . 
  well all i can say is in my experience some people in wales do use it . 
  doctor, 
   no , you do n't . 
  none of your links say that you do lets reiterate :  last year our notional contribution to the eu was # 17.8 billion ( # 340 million a week ) -  the sum of # 350m a week is based on the treasury 's estimation of the gross amount the uk contributed to the eu last year , which was # 17.8 bn , or # 342m a week . 
  ok , so both of my pro-remain links ** do ** in fact say that . 
   in fact , the rebate is effectively deducted at source , and so not actually sent to the eu at all . 
  again , basic english comprehension here : what does effectively in this context mean ? 
  - the rebate is controlled by the eu . 
  the pro leave argument here is that we send # 350m to the eu which we then do not control . 
  this argument does not say we do not get a portion back , it says we do not control the money anymore . 
  which is true . 
  the money flow is like this : westminster -  eu -  westminster + eu inb4 ; the rebate ca n't be cancelled because we can veto it . 
  this is an argument you might say makes the original fact misleading , it does not change the fact however that technically the rebate is under eu control . 
   that 's not what i was talking about in the slightest ? 
  there 's slightly more non-eu immigrants coming to the uk than eu immigrants . 
  that 's just a fact . 
  a fact that when stated in context of the relative populations is shown for what it truly is . 
   as for the `` imbalance '' , europe 's on our geographical doorstep , duh . 
  it 's 2016 . 
  travelling around the world is as easy as buying an airplane ticket . 
   also immigrating from the eu is much easier . 
  yes , this is the part that brexit are against . 
   or are we running diversity quotas on immigration ? 
  yes , it appears we are favouring white immigration and stamping down on non-white immigration . 
   i thought the right hated that kind of thing ? 
  the only people who like the eu are the centre . 
  true left and true right both are for out . 
  i 'm not right wing , lol . 
  are the chippys round you chippys or chinese takeaway that sells chips ? 
   # 350m is an imaginary number ; it is not the amount sent to the eu . 
  honestly do n't know how you can even argue this . 
  even pro-remain sites admit it , though they try to skirt around it . 
   last year our notional contribution to the eu was # 17.8 billion ( # 340 million a week ) . 
  http://infacts.org/uk-doesnt-send-eu-350m-a-week-or-55m-a-day/  the sum of # 350m a week is based on the treasury 's estimation of the gross amount the uk contributed to the eu last year , which was # 17.8 bn , or # 342m a week . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week -  in fact , the rebate is effectively deducted at source , and so not actually sent to the eu at all . 
  again , i am saying that the leave campaign is * technically * correct and that it is a misleading fact , not a lie . 
  that it is effectivly deducted at source does not mean it technically is . 
  knock knock, 
   also , non-eu immigration is still higher than eu immigration .
