but why ? 
  this is a developing story and hardly anyone checks a reddit thread more than once , let alone checking the comments . 
  if you 're going to make the thing a megathread at least sticky it . 
  i do n't know about you but this seems a little more important than `` theatres of europe '' which is currently stickied . 
   half the population of mexico/caribbean move to us/canada . 
   population of us/canada fucked as their jobs go to cheap migrants . 
   population of mexico/caribbean fucked as entire active population move north and they run out of skilled workers . 
  not if you just ignore the context , that makes it much more simple . 
  you should read up on how bishops are actually chosen because it 's way more complicated than you seem to think . 
  turns out you can be cancerous and not welcome in today 's society in more ways than one . 
  who knew . 
  i 've literally never seen a straight pride parade, 
  sitting outside an embassy does n't exactly break the bank . 
  i have n't seen that one . 
  i like [ the one with all the chameleons and stuff on . 
  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dlqbekbebow/voxqdmpqmhi/aaaaaaaal5a/19uxu6_7bse/s640/img_5738.jpg ), 
  it 's great , really cheap as well . 
  green is my favorite flavour . 
  frugo is fucking top, 
  the whole point of rules is that you should n't be able to be pedantic about them . 
  a rule with this many holes is not a good rule . 
  this rule makes no sense . 
  sure it works for the big ones like the holocaust , but what about genuinely debated ones like the potato famine ? 
  what if someone just made up a genocide ? 
  would calling that out get you banned ? 
  i do n't understand why you 're arguing with me we both agree here, 
  so obviously they * do n't * follow russian construction and law . 
  especially since even capital punishment is outlawed in russia . 
  * but it obviously does n't *, 
  if you looked past a spelling mistake and the intro to a wikipedia article you 'd realise that it 's a lot more complicated than you want it to be . 
  and if you actually knew anything about chechenya you 'd know that that 's not true . 
  but we do though . 
  like when the malaysian airlines flight was shot down and russia was blamed instead of ukraine , even though it happened in ukraine . 
  since russia has outlawed capital punishment you 're right , it could not happen in moscow . 
  chechnya is russian as hell when they 're doing fucked up shit but as soon as russia tries to exert any control over them it 's all `` chechnya is independent stop fucking with them '' . 
  the roman republic did n't really fall at all though , it just sort of changed . 
  especially when discussing the world 's most powerful geopolitical force . 
  i have n't read enough about brexit to hold any strong opinions on it . 
  i enjoy how the three other replies to this comment all used the same dog example , only one person was neutral , the other used it as a pro-putin argument and the third as an anti-putin argument . 
  you underestimate how much the neckbeard social psychology squad enjoy pushing their own predispositions onto grainy contextless gifs of politicians talking to each other . 
  it 's celebrity for people who think they 're too smart for celebrities . 
  [ yeah , top tier journalism right here . 
  real hard hitting shit ] ( https://youtu.be/2lhaidikujm ) do n't kid yourself , this is just celebrity gossip only projected onto politicians to make you feel smart at the same time . 
  where did this no go zone bullshit even come from ? 
  muslim residents were getting up early to eat because it 's ramadan and they noticed the fire . 
  death toll of the 7/7 bombing was 56 so nope . 
  that 's why he buggered off to the colonies . 
  you 're russian disinformation . 
  it 's a type of dog right ? 
  that 's crazy . 
  i see burqas most days in the uk . 
  wow , never expected tucker carlson to get upvoted in r/europe . 
  a ) i do that already b ) fairly sure that 's not possible , definitely not on mobile which i usually use c ) there is n't one, 
  * shrug * vote is pretty shit though * shrug * and mainly just * shrug * neo * shrug * nazis . 
  * shrug *, 
   [ official : trump ` looking at ' future of us sanctions on russia ] ( http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/335244-official-trump-looking-at-future-of-us-sanctions-on-russia ) ah , i see . 
  trump has not lifted any sanctions on russia but an `` official '' says he 's ** considering ** it so that means nothing . 
   [ syrian governor confirms air base operating again ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/09/syrian-governor-confirms-air-base-operating-again.html ) i 'm sure if the us lobbed 59 tomohawk missiles at a canadian airbase it would mean absolutely nothing if the damage was n't too severe . 
  it 's almost as though it was a warning rather than a strike . 
   the united states warned russia ahead of the attack . 
  yeah because if they did n't we 'd most likely be at war with them now . 
  i mean , they do . 
  look at the guy in france with a machete who got immediately done in by the police for example . 
  you 'd piss off a lot of crimeans . 
  yeah , read the edit . 
  it 's been there for pretty much the whole time the comment has . 
   scotland and ni have the right to leave if the british government agrees to a referendum . 
  which they did , so there 's no issue . 
   that was a huge topic in / r/uk after brexit because there were rumours that may will not allow a second indyref no matter what . 
  r/unitedkingdom is terrible and widely regarded as one of the worst country specific subreddits . 
  may is correct not to give them another referendum otherwise the snp would just keep pushing them until it went the way they wanted . 
   scotland would also not have any legal way to stop the british government from doing something stupid . 
  nobody can stop any government doing something stupid . 
  the only way to do that is to vote for whoever you think is the least stupid , which scotland have just as much of an ability to do as the rest of the country . 
   also , does wales even have a parliament ? 
  yes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_assembly_for_wales, 
  lol . 
  you did seperatism so it 's fine for you to be nationalist , same with scotland . 
  if i made a comment about how i was proud of my english heritage it would be at the bottom of the thread . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  i have n't deleted any comments ? 
  why would i delete my comments ? 
  i do n't understand what your point is . 
  scotland and ni did n't leave because they decided they did n't want to . 
  they have the right to leave but they decided against it , just like how the uk had the right to leave the eu , only we decided to do it . 
  it does n't matter if giving them a shitload to f money is standard or not , it completely disproves your claim that they are inferior members of the country ( you have n't actually described * why * you think they 're inferior yet ) . 
  it does n't matter who 's in power free university would not happen . 
  we do n't have enough money to implement it and it would not be worthwhile politically as youth are not a significant voting block . 
  scottish politicians complain about everything because that 's how they gain power . 
  it definitely does n't mean their complaints are valid , just that they 're whinier than most politicians . 
   you are a country that works like a federation i thought you said that what we were doing was standard * union * stuff ? 
  edit : my comment got removed because the link to a graph was shortened , here 's a new link http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/researchbriefing/summary/sn04033, 
  you must have missed that huge referendum we had where scotland decided to stay with us . 
  scotland is not inferior either , they have the second highest public spending per capita in the uk thanks to the barnett formula where we literally just give them extra money . 
  that 's why they have stuff like free university while the rest of the uk does not . 
  look at this chart : https://goo.gl/images/fbkyuj scotland , northern ireland and wales all receive more public funding that any other region in the uk , even london . 
  there 's enough of a correlation that it 's a standard assumption to make . 
  so direct representation is bad because '' '' '' `` tyranny of the majority '' '' '' '' '' but anything else is bad because some votes are worth more than others ? 
  what do you want ? 
  a ) not for brexit .
