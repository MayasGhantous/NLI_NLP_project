you only gave us 4 points last year . 
  we do n't forget insults to englebert humperdink lightly !, 
   `` the land of ding-dong calling '' wut, 
  they 're in our usual place !, 
  the greek finance minister must be shitting bricks right now ... 
  why is this so enjoyable ? 
  why, 
  so it 's a choice between romanian ming the merciless or greek einstein ... 
  unlikely . 
  corbyn has previously indicated that he supports ` negotiating ' with argentina over the falklands , despite the steadfast and continued opposition of the falklanders to any such move . 
  a corbyn-led government would be argentina 's best chance of taking the falklands . 
   why is the uk so unwilling to take up the mantle in the eu ? 
  why does it sit on the sidelines and let germance decide everything ? 
  whenever we do ` take up the mantle ' we are condemned just as much as when we do nothing . 
  just look at all the people in this thread hoping we leave because they see the uk as an obstacle . 
  we 're the leading voice against the batshit financial transactions tax . 
  plenty of countries are happy to sit back and let us fight against it , while the french and germans attack us for not following their agenda . 
  we get portrayed as anti-european for trying to stop a move that would cripple the largest sector of our economy . 
  good idea belgium !, 
  hey , it 's the 600 ^ ^ th anniversary of agincourt this year , so ... special pound coin ? 
  ^ ^ wait , ^ ^ what ^ ^ do ^ ^ you ^ ^ mean ^ ^ the ^ ^ french ^ ^ won ^ ^ the ^ ^ war ? 
  ^ ^ why ^ ^ is ^ ^ it ^ ^ called ^ ^ the ^ ^ hundred ^ ^ year ^ ^ war ^ ^ if ^ ^ it ^ ^ lasted ^ ^ for ^ ^ 116 ^ ^ years ? 
  ^ ^ obviously ^ ^ a ^ ^ silly ^ ^ war , ^ ^ let 's ^ ^ never ^ ^ mention ^ ^ it ^ ^ again . 
  the american service-members ' protection act ( also known as the hague invasion act ) was passed by the us congress in 2002 . 
  it authorises the president to use `` all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any u.s. or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by , on behalf of , or at the request of the international criminal court . '', 
  it became known as the hague invasion act because the icc is based in the hague , and ` all means necessary ' includes ( and would presumably entail ) the use of military force . 
  essentially , it 's a direct threat to the icc to prevent them trying any member of the us military for war crimes , genocide or crimes against humanity . 
  fantastic news . 
  i fly to the west coast of the us fairly often , connecting through an airport on the east coast . 
  at the moment , i have to wait to go through customs , pick up my bags , wheel them to a bag-drop and then on to the next gate . 
  going through customs in the uk would mean bags checked to the final destination . 
  it 'll hopefully mean shorter queues for customs as well - i 've waited for almost 3 hours at one us airport . 
  obviously subjective , but is it possible to have a measurement of happiness that is n't ? 
  it 's not as though you can use a happiness meter to measure things objectively . 
  slightly surprising to see the uk so happy . 
  maybe our national pastime of low-level complaining actually makes us happier ? 
  if you 're resident in the uk and registered to vote , then yes . 
  just like you 'd be eligible to vote in general elections . 
  if you 're a canadian living in canada , then no . 
  for the uk - probably handel . 
  although german born , he spent most of his career in london and became a naturalised british subject . 
  if not handel , then i think it 's probably a three-way tie between elgar , vaughan williams and holst . 
  of course , when you get into modern music , the list gets too long to get into in detail . 
  well , he did n't destroy the royal navy , is n't leading in the poll and the poll is n't to name the british flagship . 
  so apart from those minor inaccuracies ...

  absolutely loving the host , so sassy . 
  israel getting the guilt-vote from germany ... 
  this is just the jury votes so far . 
  it counts as a british win if australia win it , right ? 
  it 's reek from game of thrones, 
  we 're getting points . 
  wtf . 
  azerbaijan guy is creepy as all hell . 
  actually quite enjoying this bit !, 
  nice to see someone else not taking it seriously . 
  wait , we 'd get votes ? 
  make america eurovision 2017, 
  forgettable , but not totally awful . 
  so ... a win ? 
  do n't be shit , do n't be shit , do n't be shit ... oh , who am i kidding ... 
  i 'd like the song if i was n't currently having a seizure because of the graphics . 
  malta channelling the [ power rangers ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/powerrangers/images/9/94/mmpr_zordon.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091229223131 ) at the start there . 
  ok , that 's really clever staging . 
  such a eurovision song - nice to see the classic style return .

  polish weird al on now . 
  the uk has only had fixed term parliaments since 2010 - 2015 . 
  before that , parliaments had a 5 year maximum , but the prime minister could call an election at any time and often did . 
  so the early election is new ( because there has n't been a schedule for long ) , but holding a snap election is n't . 
  basically , nobody knows yet what the policies of the new government will be . 
  many of the more controversial proposals might well be dropped - with such a thin majority ( or even as a minority ) there 's not much space to be controversial . 
  the tories will almost certainly enter into a coalition of some kind with the democratic unionist party from northern ireland . 
  this will give them a razor-thin majority , but it should allow them to govern . 
  it dos have implications for a lot of things , including brexit . 
  the dup are in favour of a soft brexit . 
  the suddenly much larger group of scottish tories seem to be as well - the leader of the scottish conservative party has already hinted about that . 
  they will likely need to be accommodated - or else the conservatives do n't have a majority . 
  corbyn has already said that a labour government led by him would carry on with brexit . 
  i could equally say that there are agreements that the eu has made and these need to be renegotiated or fulfilled . 
  i expect ( or perhaps , hope ) that the rhetoric from both parties will calm down and sensible negotiations will take place . 
  i would think that the uk will end up making substantial contributions to the eu - but in return for something . 
  to pick up on the science example you mentioned - i 'm sure the uk would be happy to continue to pay into galileo , provided that it retained access . 
  the uk agreed to pay into the eu budget . 
  in return the uk was to receive benefits and payments from the eu . 
  the eu 's current position is that the uk is obliged to continue to pay after leaving the eu , but will receive no benefits whatsoever . 
  this has , for obvious reasons , been received badly in the uk . 
  especially since the figure due seems to be spiralling wildly - it was $ 20 billion , then $ 60 billion and is now apparently $ 100 billion . 
  stilton , mature cheddar , camembert , manchego , caboc ... 
  for me , the film as a whole is overshadowed by christoph waltz . 
  his performance was utterly outstanding . 
  i 'd go with either holst 's * jupiter , the briger of jollity * from the planets , or handel 's * messiah * , particularly the hallelujah chorus . 
  it can be a bit depressing - for a couple of months i leave work in the dark and get home in the dark .
