  i try to get outside over lunch , though . 
  the reverse of this , though , is the incredibly long summer days . 
  nothing like waking up at 6am with the sun already up and getting home knowing the sun 's going to be up to 11pm . 
  it 's really pleasant sitting in my garden in the sun all evening . 
  are the herrings coated in oatmeal before being fried ? 
  that 's also a traditional scottish dish . 
  theresa may 's net worth is n't known exactly , but it appears to be estimated to be around # 2.5 million to # 3 million . 
  so hardly insubstantial , but not immense either . 
  as prime minister , she lives at [ 10 downing street . 
  ] ( http://cdn2.spectator.co.uk/files/2014/04/989137361.jpg ) she also has use of the prime minister 's country home , [ chequers ] ( http://www.mediastorehouse.com/p/106/chequers-24786-037-1865339.jpg ) . 
  the richest member of cabinet is jeremy hunt - he recently sold a business he founded , increasing his net worth by around # 17 million to around # 22 million . 
  the queen is reported to have a private net worth of around # 350 million , including those residences privately owned by her . 
  you will see her reported as having a vastly higher net worth than this - one estimate from last year was # 58 billion . 
  these estimates confuse the private property of the queen with the assets of the crown and the crown estate . 
  it would appear the uk officially calls it [ macedonia ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/world/macedonia ) , not former yugoslav republic of macedonia . 
  in normal speech , it would always just be macedonia . 
  north - thurso , scotland - 58 \u00b0 n south - san ysidro , ca , usa - 32 \u00b0 n difference - 26 \u00b0 east - frankfurt , germany - 9 \u00b0 e west - san diego , ca , usa - 117 \u00b0 w i 'll be going to new zealand this year , so that 'll considerably add to the east and south figures !, 
  difference - 126 \u00b0, 
  north scotland . 
  now . 
  both of which are abidingly popular in the uk as well . 
  the bbc even has an ongoing tv series based on the three musketeers - [ the musketeers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_musketeers ) . 
  are you in scotland ? 
  if so - have a good time !, 
  irn bru is very sweet , so i 've known people who did n't grow up with it get put off by that . 
  haggis is great - rich , meaty and spicy . 
  it 's also good deep fried ( like all good scottish food ... ) . 
  so , starting with the obvious - * [ haggis ] ( https://www.visitscotland.com/cms-images/destinations/glencoe/macsween-haggis-neeps-tatties-dish?size=md ) - famously scottish . 
  * [ irn bru ] ( http://i1.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article1305396.ece/alternates/s1200/irn-bru.jpg ) - sells better than coke in scotland . 
  * [ butteries ] ( http://www.scottishrecipes.co.uk/photos/aberdeen-butteries.jpg ) - a flat bread with lots of lard , butter and salt . 
  * [ atholl brose ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/atholl_brose.jpg/800px-atholl_brose.jpg ) - a drink of oatmeal brose , whisky , honey and cream . 
  * [ cranachan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/cranachan_%284332953688%29.jpg/500px-cranachan_%284332953688%29.jpg ) - a dessert of whipped cream , whisky , honey , raspberries and toasted oatmeal soaked in more whisky . 
  acceptable ? 
  yes , of course . 
  successful ? 
  likely not . 
  we already had an islamic party of great britain , which went defunct 10 years ago without ever getting someone into any elected position . 
  we also have a slew of christian parties - which are equally unsuccessful . 
  i think the problem with these parties is that they assume that there are easily defined ` christian interests ' or ` muslim interests ' . 
  the interests of a pakistani muslim shopkeeper in glasgow differ wildly from those of a syrian refugee or an indonesian banker in london . 
  next you 'll be telling me that the french are n't really frogs , and the germans are n't made of pickled cabbage ... 
  i was about 3 and went to majorca . 
  i remember cheering when the plane landed , causing everyone else to laugh . 
  sitting on the balcony watching the builders on building opposite . 
  swimming in the huge swimming pool ( which turned out to be tiny when i revisited the area much later ) . 
  oh , and getting a double banana - two bananas in one skin . 
  being scottish , i do n't feel like i should risk saying anything about true scotsmen ... 
  it 's still widely spoken , but is more common with older people and people in rural areas . 
  older people tend to use it more-or-less exclusively , whereas younger people can drop into it , or use a doric influenced scottish english . 
  oh , and as a bonus video , [ here 's someone singing/rapping ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp9btscbqai ) in doric ... 
  i 'm from the north-east of scotland , where doric is spoken . 
  it differs quite substantially from normal scots and even more from english . 
  broad doric can be difficult for other scots to understand , let alone for others . 
  this is actually shown quite well in the disney movie brave . 
  if you 've seen it , you 'll recall that the [ ` young macguffin ' ] ( http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/brave-young-macguffin_6645.jpg ) character has a [ few lines which are completely incomprehensible ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0txmwlsple ) to the other characters . 
  the character is speaking doric - so he 's completely comprehensible to me and everyone else in the north east of scotland . 
  [ this is quite a good example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le3cbrlwse8 ) of someone speaking a mild form of doric . 
  the accent is right , but the vocabulary is n't quite as rich as it could be . 
  written down , it apparently looks quite scandinavian to some ( but i ca n't really comment on that ! ), 
  the following is a poem in doric . 
  not entirely convinced by some of the word choices . 
  the ones i got wrong were names of types of plants . 
  knowing that ` yaupon ' is a kind of holly tree seems more a test of biology than vocabulary . 
  they 're served boiled and mashed with butter when served with haggis . 
  ` tatties ' is the scots word for potatoes . 
  also served boiled and mashed with butter when served with haggis . 
  haggis is almost a stereotype of ` bad sounding ' food . 
  a sheep 's heart , liver and lungs minced with onions , oatmeal , suet and spices and encased ( traditionally ) in the sheep 's stomach . 
  put like that , it sounds horrible - even if the ingredients are n't that unsusual for any sausage . 
  in reality , good haggis is rich , savoury , meaty and spicy . 
  with neeps , tatties and ( taste depending ) whisky sauce , it 's genuinely lovely . 
  there 's always been a lot of cross-over between american and british tv . 
  up until around the mid-nineties this was mostly taking each other 's tv series and remaking them for a home audience . 
  for example , all in the family , sanford and sons and three 's company are all based on uk tv shows . 
  for our part , we mostly seem to have copied your gameshows - many of which are still going . 
  up until the mid-nineties , there was n't that much american content on broadcast british tv . 
  probably one or two things a day on broadcast tv . 
  from the mid-nineties onwards , this steadily increased . 
  on satellite tv , cable and digital ( when it arrived ) there was and is much more american content . 
  northern scotland here . 
  i grew up with it , so it 's not really something i deal with - it 's just a fact of life . 
  at this time of year , it 's really excellent - it 's fully light when i wake up at 06:30 and light for hours after i get back from work . 
  in the winter it 's not so good - dark when i go to work and dark when i leave . 
  in the middle of summer , it never really gets dark at night , either . 
  in all of june , it never gets darker than ' [ nautical twilight ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/twilight_subcategories.svg/1435px-twilight_subcategories.svg.png ) and even then only for four hours a night . ', 
  one slightly weird thing is that whenever i go on holiday in the summer , i get surprised by the short days , from my perspective . 
  it feels wrong that it might get dark at 8pm on a summer 's day . 
  i 'd expect another 2 to 3 hours of sun . 
  i do n't think so , although marischal college ( aberdeen 's town hall , basically ) was [ lit in the colours of the belgian flag ] ( https://i0.wp.com/www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/college1.jpg?resize=660%2c496&amp;ssl=1 ) . 
  in aberdeen , scotland , you 'll get a decent two bedroom flat for that much . 
  in the surrounding towns , you 'd probably manage a smaller three bedroom house . 
  it means `` island-apes out '' . 
  inselaffen is the uncomplimentary german slang for british people . 
  somewhat similar to calling a french person a frog , i suppose . 
  he means that we actively stand up for our national interests in europe . 
  to some , it 's completely unacceptable for the uk , but only the uk , to do this . 
  when france acts to protect the cap , nothing . 
  when germany acts to protect the single market for it 's manufacturing industry , nothing . 
  when the uk acts to protect the financial industry - `` inselaffen raus ! '' . 
  and just for clarity 's sake - i 'm a supporter of european integration and the eu .
