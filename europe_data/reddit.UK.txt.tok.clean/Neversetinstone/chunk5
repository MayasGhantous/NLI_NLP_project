  exactly , they are unpopular now , they were not so unpopular at the time . 
  isds clauses , its his only point that i agree with . 
  if you want a bodyguard you have to pay for them , what do you offer ? 
  at the time , the wars were not that unpopular to the american public . 
  they have been trying to improve the situation , recruiting more professional soldiers , reducing the draft to 1 year so more would actually respond to the notices , it does n't seem to have helped much . 
  squabbles yes , invasions , not so much .

  according to nato doctrine any attack with wmd must be answered with wmd . 
  as nato no longer has chemical or biological weapons that means nukes . 
  you seem to view the russians as some superhuman force , they are not . 
  consider that in a pre-planned and fully prepared for invasion , from pre prepared positions they lost 400 + casualties , that we have details of , from one military district alone . 
  their army is mainly made up in large part of conscripts who for the most part get to live fire a couple of times during their whole rotation . 
  barely trained conscripts usually do n't make for great soldiers . 
  do you think russia would be invading the ukraine if the ukraine still had their nuclear weapons ? 
  i agree . 
  if you do n't have them when someone like putin does he will think he can just do whatever he likes . 
  they had guarantees at a time when the world was interested in stopping nuclear proliferation , unfortunately they were only worth what they were written on . 
  do n't worry , the fbi will show you how to bomb something and thus show you your jihadist ways , they will of course step in at the last moment to prevent the bombing and be hailed as heroes . 
  so your banking information should have no expectation of privacy ? 
  your medical history ? 
  it 's a nice catchphrase but that 's all it is . 
  except the american organisation ( ngo ) that used to give them funding was banned a while ago was it not ? 
  edit : added ( ngo ), 
  you know , you really do n't write like a british person , sentence structure and word usages are all wrong . 
  i do n't know why you are deliberately trying to tar the perception of the british people but i can make some guesses . 
  edit : you should really at least try to spell in english rather than the windows standard american spellings too . 
  again you demonstrate my point on dissimilar outlooks , to you leadership requires weight , as you put it , to me leadership does not require weight , it requires trust . 
  trust that the person ( s ) leading will do their utmost to achieve a desired result with a minimum of consequences to you and yours or if a sacrifice must be made then it is an absolutely necessary sacrifice that would not be asked if any other option was available . 
  our definitions of leadership are disparate . 
  but you still did n't answer the question , what do you want ? 
  see that 's the problem , you do n't understand my question and i do n't understand your reply . 
  leadership does not require size to matter as everyone will agree to follow your lead ( unlikely in the eu ) , force however does as then you ram a solution down peoples throats , which does n't endear you to the people being rammed . 
  so what do you really want , everyone to be in agreement or to have a solution rammed down peoples throats ? 
  why does it have to be a bigger country , pure leadership is not reliant on size , force however is . 
  tell me you are n't asking for a free ride with your above statement that it has to be a bigger country ? 
  as to why people from other countries do what they do i do n't know , i am not from those countries , i probably do not share the same precepts , expectations and outlook as they do as i was raised in the british culture and not in theirs . 
  there will be many similarities but there will also be differences and the almost but not quite the same can really trip you up . 
  oh lets see , putin , the invasion of the ukraine , ukraine 's application to nato , the implied nuclear threat putin just made . 
  defence is also politics , its all wrapped up together in a tangled little ball so a failure in one area is a failure across the board . 
  the uk is asking for the eu to exclude russia from the swift network as a sanction for an invasion against a friendly state which could be seen as leadership , but that would affect trade figures so there 's all the humming and hawwing over it . 
  there can be no leadership when everyone heads off in different directions doing whatever they want and rules are seen as guidelines . 
  there are three countries in the eu that live up to their defence commitment to nato at this time , maybe the other eu countries should be looking at their own inability to live up to their commitments before asking anything of any other country in the eu . 
  remind me , who currently is living up to their nato commitment of 2 % of gdp in funding ? 
  oh that 's right , the us ( obviously ) , the uk , greece and estonia . 
  source : http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_topics/20140224_140224-pr2014-028-defence-exp.pdf, 
  half of the protesters probably are police anyway . 
  if they do go nuclear the world is dead anyway just some might take a little more time to die than others but would you rather live under the heel of an increasingly unstable seeming dictator ? 
  might not even be necessary . 
  for a pre-planned invasion , from prepared positions , with troops and special forces already operating within the target areas of a much weaker state , to lose 400 + casualties within the first days does n't speak to me of a vaunted military machine , especially considering the majority of russia 's army is a conscript force . 
  ( edited a word for clarity ), 
  is putin returning to an old kgb tactic perhaps ? 
  considering he was trained by the kgb ...  russian gru defector stanislav lunev said in his autobiography that `` the gru and the kgb helped to fund just about every antiwar movement and organization in america and abroad , '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_influence_on_the_peace_movement, 
  why not , he 's decided to mess with the countries of the world , several of whom have nuclear weapons too . 
  even worse for him several of those countries hold his money . 
  one in which moving large numbers of troops , some possibly from another continent , with the heavy metal like mbt 's , ifv 's , artillery , food , fuel and ammunition for all of the above , getting them dug in and set up , does n't happen overnight . 
  in graves outside pskov . 
  you 're right , i do n't , they remove options for dealing with situations because the gold must flow due to trade . 
  but the gold does n't flow to the governments concerned given the proven amount of clever but legal tax accounting practiced by oh so many international companies . 
  what really concerns me , however , is what will these treaties lock us in to when we are about to enter a period when unemployment will continuously increase due to automation , with a study predicting 47 % of all the types of jobs will disappear within 90 years . 
  trade agreements are all about the specifics though , so they can be embodied in law , otherwise they would just be non binding statements of intent . 
  estimates said the same for both the us-sk free trade agreement and nafta , neither of which has proved to be true . 
  considering the negotiations are being held in secret thus preventing any public knowledge or discussion we have to rely on leaks , so yes . 
  i have come to believe that economic predictions are worth as much as randomly throwing darts at a dart board to get predictions . 
  if economics was such a science then why has n't this science been able to predict and prevent world economic downturns such as we just experienced ? 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06economic-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 the south korea - us free trade agreement was also supposed to grow economies according to studies yet 40k jobs were lost in its wake - http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/business/global-economy/130802/us-south-korea-free-trade-agreement-obama-jobs nafta was supposed to create 200k jobs in the us alone yet actually cost 680k jobs - http://www.progressive.org/bernie_sanders_free_trade.html, 
  yet they want to re-introduce many of the problematic clauses of acta in ttip - http://icg.greens-efa.org/pipermail/hub/2013-december/000084.html and are willing to act against civil society to do so -  controversially , the supposedly neutral commission negotiator and  the ohim representative not only defined themselves as allies with  the businesses lobbyists . 
  they went far beyond this and started to  instruct the representatives in detail on how they should campaign  to `` educate '' the public in order to maximise their outcome in terms  of industry monopoly rights . 
  in particular , concerns from elected  representatives , such as the european parliament ? 
  as well as civil  society criticisms about ever increasing intellectual property  rights ? 
  were to be kept out of the public debate . 
  the us government is directly trying to influence the debate with money too - https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140620/14292827638/us-embassy-berlin-offering-cold-hard-cash-people-to-create-pro-taftattip-propaganda.shtml, 
  as you can not disprove the concerns you are indeed correct , there is nothing more to be gained . 
  they do n't even need friends in high places , if they are in an industry affected by ttip there are stakeholder briefings . 
  why ? 
  because you say so ? 
  i have provided proof that others in a relevant industry are concerned , you have provided ... nothing . 
  in the same vein as your own comments , are you part of the negotiating team to know that this is definitely not happening ? 
  actually i dispute any clause which removes the sovereignty of the state and makes it subject to the lawsuits of investors as it allows investors to punish the state for looking after its citizens above profits for companies . 
  already there is eli lily in america that is suing the canadian government over lost profits for not accepting patent applications . 
  erm in this case , no , american food safety standards are shit . 
  currently they even allow the use of ractopamine in the us , which has been banned in 160 countries . 
  http://www.salon.com/2013/11/01/is_this_meats_most_dangerous_additive_partner/ http://pulptastic.com/banned-foods-europe-america-legal/ http://www.wisemanfamilypractice.com/7-food-practices-in-the-u-s/, 
  it depends on whether the politicians are doing their job of representing their electorate honestly or whether they have been influenced by other factors . 
  considering the politicians are trying to reduce european food standards to american levels i 'd actually rather the politicians were not doing any of the negotiating to be very honest . 
  along with investor state dispute laws i think ttip holds nothing for the people of europe but a lot for companies and investors , especially those in the us . 
  note that the officer that struck him was discharged from the police for gross misconduct after he was found not guilty of manslaughter by a jury . 
  was n't the only fatality in that incident lee rigby himself ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_lee_rigby both assailants were wounded during their apprehension but survived to be convicted of murder in a court of law . 
  it does n't need much of a search to find examples , here 's one - http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=100&amp;story_id=38052, 
  hmm , is peacekeeping the defined job of all the military though ? 
  it used to be that peacekeeping was the job of police not soldiers , and many countries still follow the precept that soldiers are there to fight wars not try to keep a peace between people who do n't want a peace . 
  i thought he originally named it aluminium but then changed it to aluminum ? 
  / u/bppnyr upthread postulates that it was just the may day demo with slanted coverage . 
  its an article on a publication from a known anti eu `` thinktank '' whose previous publications include - 1 does the eu impede the uk 's economic growth ? 
  2 the demise of the free state : why british democracy and the eu do n't mix 3 time to say no ( endorsed by ukip mep & enemy of the sun roger helmer ) i would n't pay it too much attention , i certainly am not . 
  interesting times ahead . 
  thanks , 
  thanks , 
  thanks , 
  what do you say to this incident ?
