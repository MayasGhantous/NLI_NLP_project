  - http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/25/jean-claude-juncker-response-on-catalonian-independence-grows-in-translation what safeguards are in place to ensure that translation is accurate ? 
  hmm , it never used to be perceived that way . 
  according to the article this is n't about giving new powers to the ecb , this issue is about germany trying to remove powers from the ecb that they had already given when the ecb assumed oversight . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact, 
  possibly due to the new reporting rules which now require health professionals to report any fgm incidents . 
  it kind of does matter , if you lose a lot of your weapons to a first strike then you have hamstrung yourself for the responses possible . 
  we already have nukes in the uk . 
  i would think that the response times are really important in the positioning of nuclear weapons . 
  you do n't want them to be so close to the front that they can be taken out in a first strike that only takes a few minutes , you need them far enough away that there is time for a response decision , unless you want to go skynet . 
   our moderation here should be more transparent and if not agreed with , it should at least be understood . 
  now that is a perfect statement about how moderation should be , bravo . 
  is this a good thing ? 
  there were many complaints in europe about the american courts seeking data on europeans held on european servers owned by american companies . 
  would n't this just give the american courts more legitimacy as they can say `` well europe is doing the same thing '' ? 
  not if you want efficiency , also it currently gives a degree of power to the translators employed , as how something is translated can have a dramatic effect on its reception . 
  what megathread ? 
  i would advise you to read this topic - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hcbld/changes_in_reurope_moderation/, 
  hey we make do with what we have , to us it has a lot of lakes so its the lake district , 
  so you compare a country that has almost three times england 's landmass and less than 1/10th of our population on the relative size of our national parks ? 
  land area of england 130,395 square km . 
  land area of finland 338,145 square km . 
  population of england 57.5 million . 
  population of finland 5.36 million .

  is this another way of asking non euro eu countries to contribute to the bailout , after the efsm proposal ? 
  yes , the support from europe was overwhelming was n't it . 
  under what pretext would the other anglo nations had cause to declare war on argentina ? 
  that would depend on how willing nato/eu personnel and their various command structures would have been to put their lives on the line for british falkland islanders , no ? 
  if there was massive procrastination it would have allowed argentina to build up defences and thus make the relief prospect even less enticing . 
  how many in europe supported a diplomatic solution to the invasion ? 
  do n't you find flame wars boring after the 10,000 th repetition of `` may your scrotum be infested by the fleas of a thousand camels '' ? 
  why thank you , being perfidious albion can be quite fun sometimes . 
  not every disagreement can be resolved , so in a situation where neither side can ` win ' , what would you suggest ? 
  actually no they are not . 
  british overseas territories are not covered by nato or the eu . 
  if the alternative is leaving them in an active warzone with soldiers who quickly become desensitised to violent acts , possibly forever , then yes , i at least , would send them if i could n't take them . 
  sir , you boggle the mind . 
  erm , they were just consulted about that and the majority of them said no . 
  actually i am quite happy with our gun laws , you can have a gun if you can prove you are n't crazy and have a reason to have one . 
  having a gun just on the off chance you might want to kill someone sometime does n't seem sensible to me . 
  i would just like to say that , to me at least , it feels a hell of a lot better being a part of this community now than it has for a while . 
  thank you to all the mods for addressing our concerns in a productive manner . 
  tuting is kind of a national pastime here . 
  this is good , if they are assholes they will be banned again . 
  if they are n't we get their contributions to the discussions . 
  theskynet is no longer a mod . 
  perhaps that could be noted as a question to be asked before future experimental moderation actions are implemented - `` will this work with what we have ? '', 
  could i ask if the mod team will be taking a look at the current community rules and guidelines . 
  some of them are very vague and open to widely differing interpretations in my opinion . 
  i see your hole and raise you with this hole - http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sinkhole-guatemala-city-2010.jpg, 
  welcome to the propaganda warfare arena of the 21st century , the internet . 
  you have pro russian and anti russian camps , paid ` reputation management ' teams on both sides and independent supporters of both sides also abound . 
  how a post fares depends on the time of posting , who else is on and who gets the biggest early push on vote direction as the hivemind tends to continue a trend . 
  also if its the same topic as has been posted recently downvotes will accrue , unless it was originally obscure and not many saw it . 
  there 's also how interesting the article is , bland and dry does n't fare well but neither does overmuch sensationalism which will just be labelled clickbait . 
  an interesting sub is / r/theoryofreddit, 
  legally it does n't have to be accepted anywhere as scots banknotes are promissory notes not legal tender also english notes are only legal tender for england and wales . 
  are you sure the feds mandate is maximum ** unemployment ** ? 
  echr disapproves of final solutions . 
  population pressure is only going to make it worse , everywhere , with less homogeneity due to growth and displacement . 
  yes i have thanks . 
  some do , some do n't . 
  if there were no racial tensions in america then why are you all banging on about it all the time over there and why are there riots ( ferguson etc. ) ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_riot#1978_to_today edit : if you need further proof - http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/10/black-delivery-driver-replaced-by-manager-after-lowes-customer-demands-white-employee/?tid=sm_fb, 
  if one or both sides are getting paid for it then its not going to stop ever , and if the other side does n't reply then only one viewpoint is going to be presented . 
  get used to it , watch the game of propaganda and learn to enjoy the plays , its never going to end . 
  its gone from $ 325,000 u.s. per grown burger patty to $ 11.36 add in economies of scale , taxes on natural livestock due to environmental concerns and it will be happening very soon . 
  there goes the schengen agreement . 
  is there anywhere in the world where one group of people does n't disparage another group who are not identical to themselves ? 
  are n't white hill billies disparaged by other white americans ? 
  tribal warfare in africa , racism towards mongolians by ethnic chinese , untouchable castes within indian society itself , slavic supremacists , the ainu people in japan being discriminated against by the japanese i think we evolved from troop animals and its so much easier for us to say `` one of us '' ( troop member ) or `` not one of us '' ( not troop member , possible enemy/competitor ) than we would ever like to admit, 
  why is it such a difficult topic ? 
  its one group of people being racist to another group of people . 
  it happens all over the world . 
  is the difficulty that they are n't white ? 
  am i supposed to believe that only white people can be racist ? 
  unfortunately racism seems to be a fact of the human condition as its so much easier to define ourselves by what we are not than what we are . 
  its a lot worse over there , its almost as if corbyn was the second coming to some people . 
  to me it seems similar to the adulation given to obama by the american people when he was running for his first term . 
  in my view cults of personality are always dangerous , putin , blair , obama etc. 
  as they will never be able to live up to what is invested in them by their supporters . 
  wonder how the moscow patriarchate will spin this ? 
  i would guess its an anti fraud measure , any investigation requiring a case number so costs can be tracked and assigned thus preventing any under the table payments for ` investigations ' carried out . 
  it seems not - http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33730700 thanks to / u/dngrs https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fb9sk/russia_mistral_hollande_denies_striking/, 
  so will there be an explanation of what happened coming soonish ? 
  couple of people just had their bans reverted , can you post anything now ? 
  the poster of the last thread to ask this question can no longer make new threads on this sub . 
  okay then i am ` guessing ' your name has been put into the automod as a spammer so any new posts created by you will be refused/removed . 
  you sir have been banned from r/europe , or at least it appears so from your statement , can you comment on existing posts ? 
  not sure , possibly use of automod feature ? 
  did n't appear in the moderation log, 
  thread removed ? 
  i messaged the mods about it and / u/dclauzel sent this -  bonjour !, 
   no idea , i am working . 
  will have a look this evening . 
  immigration megathread part iii has been deleted . 
  that really provides very little information to the debate posed by the article . 
  http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?r=20140006052 nasa report confirming thrust is being produced . 
  i thought the americans used ambassadorships as payoffs for campaign supporters . 
  the real diplomats are the us foreign service members .
