  i thought they got a 7 billion loan and have entered into negotiations about the 100 billion ? 
  of the 7 billion loan its estimated they already spent 95 % on settling repayments due , including getting out of arrears with the imf in hopes the imf will lend them some more in the future .

  thanks , 
  when is the actual voting expected to start ? 
  so everyone on this reddit is an unaverage joe ? 
  i am of the opinion that the economic union was the eu , the monetary union was the ez and there is no fiscal union at all . 
  politicians tend to follow ideals rather than pragmatic economics , which is something that got the ez into this mess in the first place . 
  is the ez a political or an economic problem ? 
  when you mix the two bad things happen as money does n't follow idealism . 
  has there been even a whiff of a meeting to discuss the structural failings yet ? 
  some articles about the uk not/joining the euro from the start and end periods of the uk discussion - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2968540.stm http://www.economicshelp.org/2007/03/gordon-browns-5-economic-test-for.html http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/771/euro/should-uk-join-the-euro/, 
  is the current structure of the eu up to an immediate political union ? 
  something like this needs to be pragmatically planned , in meticulous detail with fall back and fail safe positions , or it goes off the rails really easily as has been evidenced in the monetary union . 
  the institutions that would have to be created , the transfers of powers , money and personnel from national governments to the union worked out safeguards against cronyism and corruption would have to be in place . 
  it is not something that can be rushed into , at least , not if you do n't expect it break up fairly quickly . 
  the negotiations to start the negotiations would probably take years of discussions anyway . 
  `` think of it as evolution in action '' - larry niven , 1982 . 
  agreed . 
  well this is going to depress the oil price even more when iran starts selling . 
  possibly if this is what they are trying , but then the eu will have even less money to do things with if the uk leaves , we are after all a net contributor to the eu 's budget . 
  yes i have , have you ? 
  juncker wants to ignore the treaties the uk has with the eu and also ignoring the fact that the uk is not even in the eurozone . 
  he 's being told to get stuffed in diplospeak but will that stop him ? 
  it seems the map is now out of date - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d5vm1/eu_demands_britain_joins_greek_rescue_fund/, 
  juncker seems determined to drive the uk out of the eu when the referendum occurs . 
  would slovakia , or any of the other nations currently against further bailout , be a pariah or even care if it were . 
  it seems many voters in many nations are not pro bailout . 
  the imf can not by its own rules lend any more money to nations that are in arrears to the imf . 
  greece entered arrears to the imf on the 30th of june . 
  does n't the new agreement have to be ratified by all involved parliaments for it to go ahead ? 
  if so i believe you are misstating the case when you say only three votes matter . 
  deal about to be reached with iran that would allow them to pump oil again , number of us shale oil companies actually expanded last month , ksa seeks to invest in russia , co-incidence ? 
  figure two maybe three generations . 
  i would n't have termed it an argument so much as a discussion , but indeed . 
  hemm trajans reputation was challenged during the enlightenment by edward gibbson and theodor mommsen . 
  well you said `` when you have a less than competent dictator '' , i wanted to be sure there was n't some actually competent dictator that had actually escaped my notice somewhere in human history . 
  so we are agreed , no dictatorship has ever been competent ? 
  could you name me an always efficient , always competent dictator from all of human history ? 
  i do not believe that dictatorships are that efficient . 
  it would be true that a dictator could get things done , but to ensure they would be the right things to be done would require a superhuman intelligence and an infinite capacity for detailed planning , neither of which have been demonstrated in the power hungry types that want to become dictators . 
  its my belief that getting the wrong things done quickly can be a lot worse than getting the right things done more slowly . 
  possibly not for long http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32443930 good luck to whatever country they move to . 
  how quickly do you think that could be effected considering the lack of liquidity will soon force greece to issue a new currency ? 
  would n't a new agreement , one that does not follow on from the conditions authorised before , require ratification by the parliaments of all nations concerned ? 
  what incentive would the farmers have to produce more than they require to survive if the money they get paid in reduces in value day by day and the seeds , fertiliser , pesticides and fuel costs increase day by day ? 
  i thought the ela already ( in effect ) pulled the plug by not increasing the funding , they just have n't recalled their current loans to greece ? 
  the labour costs may be lower but they would have difficulty getting the raw materials required until a stable currency is created in greece . 
  well there 's at least one thing that 's certain , the imf can no longer lend any money to greece as greece went into arrears on their repayment schedule on the 30th of june . 
  if greece does not have a viable currency ( one that does not suffer from hyperinflation ) in place i predict that the rural areas that produce the food will move to a local barter system . 
  in the event that this becomes a reality it might actually come to pass that greece would need to import more food as the city dwellers would n't have much to barter with the ruralists . 
  farmers may also experience difficulties in obtaining pesticides , fertilisers and seeds so crop yields could fall . 
  if they print a new drachma with inadequate security its really going to haunt them in the time to come . 
  does greece produce the inks and paper used in the bank notes ? 
  if not how big of a supply do they keep to hand i wonder . 
  could we get some different language live coverage sources ? 
  6 french language and 2 english language sources , no german , no spanish and especially no greek sources out there ? 
  i apologise whole heartedly for not specifying the belgians and only having them in the etc. 
  part . 
  i have a problem with a presidential system for europe , it is much easier for a dictator to come to power in a presidential system than in a parliamentary system as the president is the head of state and chief executive . 
  we can see it being attempted in turkey and macedonia , it has happened in russia already . 
  okay , now who will these united forces buy weapons from ? 
  the british , french , dutch , german , swiss , swedish , finnish , greek , hungarian , irish , italian , hungarian , norwegian , montenegran , polish , portuguese , spanish , romanian , etc all have arms companies they want to protect an nurture . 
  to achieve economies of scale the orders will have to be placed with a very limited number of companies and devil take the hindmost . 
  who wants to give up their arms industry , hands in the air please ? 
  what she meant to say was london should choose her to lead it . 
  then i will await their victory but i wont be holding my breath for it . 
  there is another term for those who choose to ignore reality . 
  which is all very well , but it does n't fit what will happen in the real world . 
  great he gets the job but then he cant do anything in the job because he 's pissed off everyone he needs to work with to do his job .

  as russia is not a contracting party to the convention , what is the point of this ? 
  thanks for delisting mine , though it was first , the title had changed and the next was better . 
  ah i wooshed , its a common thing for me , 
  except to be in a dogfight the delivery airframe has to survive to get into range , not exactly easy against a foe you ca n't find . 
  i think the term national football league should give you a hint as to why no non american team has won a superbowl , which is after all only a national championship cup . 
  you do realise the aim 9x is a short range air to air heat seeking missile do n't you ? 
  most military procurement planning for aircraft goes on a 20 to 30 year overall lifespan for an aircraft type , if the aircraft can still perform after that then its a bonus as the technology of killing is improving all the time . 
  so , depending on what you class as short to midterm , yes its best to concentrate on exactly that as nothing will last forever . 
  edit : as to your new improved missiles , which could i ask exactly what missiles those are , you have to be able to see it to hit it . 
  um yes there is a trade-off . 
  in a low observability airframe you do trade off all sorts of capabilities , for the capability of not being able to be detected to be shot at . 
  this will change when the next generation radars become commonplace as they look for where there are no signals , the holes in the electromagnetic sky where the aircraft are , however these radars require a lot of processing power and would be limited to static defence radars , at least in the beginning . 
  anything that sits still can be hit . 
  why do you think so many countries want stealth ? 
  edit : btw you do realise the f-35 is not intended for the air superiority role ? 
  that 's the role of the f-22 . 
  you can not have an airframe that performs better than everything else in all situations , its a physical impossibility . 
  if only one viewpoint is allowed to be espoused then this sub will become an echo chamber like so many others , which would be comfortable for some but actually makes the sub useless in terms of discussion of differing viewpoints . 
  if the spying is not limited to political and military fields but also includes technological and economic spying for advantage then yes it could be fairly said that it harms that country that is being spied upon .
