  greens ( left ) - they 're pretty much the same as every other green party . 
  what a great argument . 
  it 's like a russian arguing with an american , but with cities . 
  it was probably just banter . 
  america ? 
  britain ? 
  france ? 
  germany ? 
  come on , that 's too broad a description . 
  how old is this ? 
  considering most of the other states seem to be ruled by monarchs or emperors , that 's mighty progressive of old poland . 
  no , i 'm actually against leaving the eu . 
  but , if it does happen , i 'm trying to look for a silver lining in it . 
  maybe the tories will have to actually be held accountable for once . 
  no more lib-dems that , no more eu this , everything they do will be on them . 
  hell , maybe the could even , * gasp * , lose some voters ? 
   i hope the uk leaves fast , so that we can impose tariffs as well . 
  thank you the eu wanted tariffs ( on chinese steel ) though , at ~ 66 % . 
  cameron got that lowered to something like 9 % . 
  leaving the uk would literally be a step back in that area . 
  i 'm pretty sure even a scandal revealing that every single tory mp was a kiddy fiddler would n't stop people from voting for them . 
  if it involves breaking the law and exploiting a large international crisis ( and the goodwill of the countries taking in refugees ) , then yeah . 
  if it means packing your bags and moving to sweden legally , then no . 
  refugees flee from war , natural disaster , etc. 
  moving away because your country sucks is fine , but you should be going through legal channels instead . 
  i think the setup is meant to make people think of the tour de france . 
  that 's not quite tic tac toe though , the grid is 4x4 . 
  at this point i do n't know whether a nazi is a nazi or someone who does n't like immigration , so i 'll just say this instead : guess what , even nazis have the right to peaceful demonstration . 
  generally , muslims who have lived in eastern europe for generations ( like the tartars ) are far milder in their views . 
  i 'm not a big fan of absolute denial of refugees , but i can see why some poles would be fine with muslims with roots in europe over arabs . 
  because there 's quite a bit of a cultural difference between chechen and arabs . 
  well , at least your comment taught me not to call albanians slavic . 
  i always thought trade deals involved a deal where various countries traded more with each other , i never realised authoritarian corporatism was such a big part of a good trade deal . 
  pol pot and mao zedong killed religious figures because they wanted a secular society in which it would be easier to create a cult of personality . 
  does that count ? 
  why the fuck do nestle get euromoney ? 
  not only are they huge , they 're corrupt as fuck as well . 
  have n't you learned that the bad guys always look cooler yet ? 
  hey now , i do n't agree with ( or have even read , for that matter ) the links given . 
  i 'm just trying to help out , you know ? 
  [ you can actually find the relevant post on his overview page .

  no , probably stupid . 
  i think corax wants conservatives/nationalists while merkel 's party is basically social democratic . 
  it was decent methinks . 
  if they had a bit more backbone and actually told people all the stuff they did , they would n't be in this mess . 
  unsatisfactory compromises and bad pr did them in . 
  it 's always funny when people get butthurt over international disputes that happened decades ago . 
  that 's an 18.3 % drop . 
  yes , i trust some people to decide what others can or ca n't do ( to a degree ) , but i trust no one with deciding what others can or ca n't say . 
  because i do n't trust anyone to decide what can be said and what ca n't . 
  so the only people going in power will be those who ** directly benefit ** from the current electoral system and will have absolutely no motivation to change it in any way . 
  note how it says `` or a fairer alternative '' , which the fee system under the coalition arguably was . 
  the tories are in power by themselves now though , so so much for that . 
  i like that the eu getting federalists and staunchly pro-eu figures into the negotiations is an `` act of war '' , yet farage going into parliament and insulting everyone , extremely anti-eu individuals like david davis being appointed to carry out the exit , and british media shitting all over the eu to the point where they had to open up a feed to disprove all the nonsense they write is completely acceptable . 
  a functioning democracy required an informed electorate . 
  leaving the eu is a huge deal , and i would wager the uk electorate is worse informed than any other eu nation when it comes to the eu . 
   against austerity we have a vote to stop this every five years . 
  you can take a look at our house of commons to see how much the british care about opposing austerity . 
  you never know what you have until it 's gone !, 
  we 're living in relatively fantastic times , both for quality of life , peace , and development . 
  who knows what will bring it down ? 
  i think your comment was accidentally lost off the reddit servers . 
  that 's brought on by an accident that left them deformed . 
  it is not the same as cosmetic ( and irreversible ) surgery for the heck of it . 
   on 4 july a mouse ran across the sofa in the chancellor of the exchequer 's office , sending one official screaming from the room . 
  the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne and cabinet office minister matthew hancock eventually cornered the mouse , trapping it in a brown paper sandwich bag . 
  the incident increased pressure on larry 's chief mouser position as rumours spread that the chancellor of the exchequer would take over the chief mouser position . 
  reads like a private eye article at times . 
  hence `` cosmetic '' . 
  is n't that what you call a certain kind of biscuit ? 
  he looks like hp lovecraft . 
  just for reference , reddit does n't use html tags . 
  you want two asterisks surrounding what you want to make bold . 
  / ** stuff / ** ( without the slash ), 
  that looks like it would fall over easily . 
  edit : i swear this was n't a 9/11 joke when i was writing it . 
  they just look top-heavy , you know ? 
  did they do anything particularly or do people just not like their policies ? 
  from a cursory glance they seem to be very similar to the liberal democrats , who i wholeheartedly support . 
  question , why do people hate the fdp ? 
  here 's the thing , we do n't even know if we will have that . 
  the eu is very insistent on having free movement of people if you intend on joining the single market . 
  the leave campaign got people to think that leaving means democracy , # 350 million per week for anything the government desires , and an end to that pesky immigration . 
  if they do not follow up on this , which seems increasingly likely , their campaign will have been a total mockery of the democratic process , and pointing that out would not be the same as calling leavers stupid . 
  he should n't have apologised . 
  he should have instead explained to people how the student loan system was reformed , because no one seems to actually know anything about the fees beyond `` they tripled '' . 
  what people always forget is that the increase of fees ( pushed by the conservatives ) was accompanied by a reform to the system used to pay back student loans . 
  this new system was much more generous to poor students and , as clegg often pointed out himself , the number of working class university students has increased . 
  no one seems to care about that , though . 
  i bet this is how it went down :  cameron : hey nick , time to decide what happens to tuition fees . 
   clegg : i want the fees tripled , david . 
   cameron : nick , what are you doing ? 
  you made a promise to the electorate and now you are betraying them of your own accord !, 
   clegg : ha , finally the fools will see what a bastard i really am !, 
  triple the fees !, 
  triple them !, 
  let everyone know i lied , and i 'm not even sorry !, 
   cameron : nick , no !, 
  think of the poor students !,
