  we have had more opt-outs than any other eu country , from a permanent exclusion from the eurozone to a permanent exclusion from schengen , to a large rebate on payments towards the eu . 
  also , why do brexiters always make it sound as if the eu tyrannically subjugates the united kingdom ? 
  we pooled our power in with the rest of the eu to give us an upper hand in negotiations , and given that we had tha the second-most seats in the ep and a major role in the council and commission , we had a lot of direct influence on the goings-on . 
  yes , with all those privileges and opt outs from further integration . 
  what 's their view on surveillance , internet censorship/control , and the future of the eu ? 
  m5s is eurosceptic , is it not ?

  in most european languages , in fact . 
  unelected brussels bureaucrats, 
  i thought sweden was progressive ? 
  i wonder why those countries might not like russia . 
  for real though , you 're delusional if you think they 'd want to actually invade . 
  if only russians had as much respect for the sovereignty of other nations as they do for their own . 
  well , at least you made it very obvious that you know nothing about the eu . 
  no , those were ** suggestions ** . 
  these kinds of post are now more common than what they complain about . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryszard_petru#education_and_early_career_.281990s.e2.80.932001.29  ryszard petru studied at the faculty of computer science and management of the wroc\u0142aw university of technology , [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and graduated from the warsaw school of economics . 
  [ 6 ] during the second year of his studies at the wse , he became an assistant of the democratic union mp w\u0142adys\u0142aw frasyniuk . 
  [ 6 ] on the recommendation of his lecturer leszek balcerowicz , petru began working for the center for social and economic research . 
  in 1995 , he became balcerowicz 's assistant . 
  [ 6 ] do n't know much about his party , but he does n't exactly seem to be uneducated . 
  or a peasant , considering his career in finance . 
  replace `` liberals '' with `` progressives '' . 
  / u/dabbooo explicitly said that liberal was used in the us meaning of the word , which , by definition , is not the european meaning of ` liberal ' . 
  yeah , but '' ( in the us meaning of the word ) '' makes it not the european kind of liberalism . 
  in `` the us meaning of the word '' , liberal usually refers to democrats , social liberals , social democrats , or any `` leftie '' ideology . 
   true liberal ( in the us meaning of the word ) so a social democrat ? 
  did two parallel universes fuse together for a second here ? 
  yeah , but not because of an inherent respect for individual opinion in the law but because it 's not possible to prosecute . 
  i would say that quite a few people equate making voicing an opinion illegal equal to banning that opinion , because it 's as close to silencing it as you can get . 
  to be fair , it is literally impossible to prosecute for holding such opinions without the ability to read people 's minds . 
  albania is over 50 % muslim , but albanian muslims are generally more secular and far less fundamentalist than muslims from further into the middle east . 
  same deal with tatars living in eastern europe . 
  i would say the issue is n't islam in itself as much as it is the tendency for muslims of middle eastern origin to adhere to stricter and more fundamentalist islamic beliefs . 
  hey , that image has # ** enemy of the people ** cropped out . 
  hitler was born on the 20th of april . 
  you 'd think the `` nazi '' code we would be 204 in this case , but apparently not . 
  huh , the netherlands are very anti-federalist but also strong supporters of an eu army . 
  that 's the point though , the european council is meant to represent the heads of state of constituent nations , not the electorate . 
  getting rid of the council ( or making it directly elected ) would push the eu further towards federalisation , which people seem generally opposed to . 
  hah , i 'd like to see him try . 
  this really reminds me of the uk liberal democrats . 
  social liberal , pro-free market party , got 56 seats in the 2010 general election and formed a coalition with the conservative party . 
  people then accused them of just being orange tories and breaking promises and they got 8 seats this election ( their vote fell to a third of their 2010 result , i think , but they were disproportionately punished by fptp ) . 
  i still support the liberal democrats after reading up what they did during the coalition ( their in-government self-promotion was awful ) so i guess seeing parallels with the fdp makes me question whether it 's a similar situation . 
  what exactly has the fdp done ? 
  right , because countries want to join . 
  so what 's the issue ? 
  yes , they annexed all those countries . 
  they totally did n't voluntarily join or anything . 
  you already know the answer . 
  because this is the bbc , not cnn . 
  they have to be as neutral and objective as they can by design . 
  and 2 % of the seats ... 
  `` the fact that almost three million more people voted clinton is irrelevant because i say so . '', 
  - you, 
  trump apparently has multiple printed copies of the [ district results ] ( http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2016/countymaprb1024.png ) . 
  [ i wonder what happens if you weigh them by population ... ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/how-election-maps-lie/img/vanderbei-examples-600.jpg?c=685 ), 
  does 62,984,825 sound like more than 65,853,516 to you , dipshit ? 
  real nice majority you 've got there , friendo . 
   viva, 
  what do you expect from a us-based trumpette ? 
  this but unironically, 
  marine is literally just attacking macron , she has proposed basically no policy of her own . 
  negotiations have started . 
  article 50 has been triggered . 
   perhaps they just disagree with you ? 
  not everybody who holds a different opinion than you is stupid . 
  i 'm not saying they 're stupid . 
  i 'm saying that the british public has proven to hate political compromise whenever an opportunity for compromise arises . 
  fptp gives a monopoly of power to two parties which are then almost impossible to displace without a major societal reaction . 
  this is something i absolutely can not stand behind myself . 
   also your numbers about the german election are off , the cdu did not get 52 % of seats . 
  they would n't have needed to form a coalition in that case . 
  you 're absolutely correct , i did not consider the overhang seats in the quick calculations i made . 
   i would rather have a government with a mandate to actually enact the policies people voted for . 
  but only if they voted for one of the two big parties , i assume ? 
  what about the huge amount of voters ( lib dem , ukip , green , etc ) who had basically no representation over the past elections because of the system ? 
  compromise reaches the middle point between what * everyone * voted for , as opposed to just the lucky lot who have their opinions reflected by the two biggest parties . 
   look at the lib dem voters who had their wishes on tuition fees completely ignored because of compromise . 
  the party betrayed it 's voters in the name of compromise . 
  the con-lib coalition is not a good example because brits seem to have an absolute aversion to political compromise , caused exactly by the fptp system you are defending . 
  people here do not understand coalitions and they do not have their votes accurately represented seat-wise in coalitions . 
  the uk and the us are perfect examples of the sort of tribalistic division unproportional and inflexible electoral systems cause . 
  i do n't agree with / u/new-atlantis , but the most pro-eu party in parliament got screwed by fptp constantly for the past several decades . 
  the 2015 election was the only one in recent history where eurosceptics got a worse result , and that 's only because of ukip 's increase in popularity . 
   moves politicians even further away from representing the issues of local people . 
  less so than any form of pr . 
   it also leads to constant coalition governments which has it 's own drawbacks in comparison to systems like fptp or av which would lead to much more decisive victories . 
  if the decisive victories are not representative of the vote , then why have them ? 
  ( semi - ) proportional systems like stv represent the actual will of the people \u2122 far better than fptp or av . 
   you end up with governments without the power to enact their manifestos or who claim they 're not responsible for their own actions ( see the lib dems and tuition fees ) . 
  compromise in politics is a good thing . 
  you end up with policymaking which reflects the opinions of the voters as opposed to whoever got favoured by fptp the most . 
  pr systems also cause the rise of parties which agree with each other enough to form cohesive coalitions . 
  fptp split us right down the middle with a conservative party , a social democratic party , and a liberal party , with the liberal party having to compromise with the conservative party after their seat proportions got skewed to hell thanks to fptp . 
  in countries like denmark and norway , you get blocs of parties who agree with each other enough to form stable governments but represent enough unique political stances to be individual parties . 
  stability is another point i see used often , so let 's put that to rest now . 
  fptp causes the two major parties to become internally split .
