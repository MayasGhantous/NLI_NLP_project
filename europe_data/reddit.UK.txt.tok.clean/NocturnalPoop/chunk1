democracy !, 
  oh ... well apologies for presuming !, 
  you 're american , are n't you ? 
  perhaps , but according to irish nationality laws i can become an irish citizen despite never setting foot in the country all because my dad was born in ni . 
  perhaps scotland will have a similar deal because of it 's close ties with the rest of the uk ? 
  as an english remain voter i am royally miffed . 
  been tutting all week . 
   muslims who believe wife should obey husband - 1.39 billion . 
  muslims who believe sharia should rule - 1.1 billion . 
  these were not uncommon beliefs in western society not that long ago ( obviously not sharia , but there are people still who do not like the separation of church and state ) . 
  things can change . 
   muslims who believe in death for adultery - 748 million . 
  muslims who believe in death for leaving islam - 584 million . 
  i actually agree these are potential issues . 
  firstly , if most muslims go around whether is western culture or not believing this without actually implementing it then i think they should be free to do so . 
  i think they 're assholes , but they 're allowed to be . 
  secondly , putting up a barrier between non-muslim westerners and all muslims and declaring war will literally just make everything worse . 
  i do not have the perfect solution to solve these issues . 
  if i did i would n't be wasting my time on this stupid thread . 
  i 'll repeat what i said earlier : declaring war on islam will only create more suffering and ** will not solve anything ** . 
  it will divide us even more than we currently are . 
  i still maintain that the best way to overcome this is to work with muslims in western and non-western society , experts on extremism , psychologists etc. 
  to try to stop people becoming extremists in the first place . 
  if you think that the solution to this is violence and war like most of the jingoists in this thread you are being foolish . 
  you are not analysing the issues even remotely closely . 
  you are just looking at a surface level , seeing muslims and blaming all of them in a blanket statement . 
  it 's fucking stupid . 
  just spit-balling , but maybe we could , once again , ask the muslims that live here as normal people and take advice from them and get them involved . 
  create organisations or charities or initiatives or whatever to help lead vulnerable muslims down the right path . 
  it 's happened with christianity so why not islam ? 
  look , i do n't know the perfect solution , this random example i 've created is vague and probably flawed and could be improved but this is a fucking reddit thread and not parliament so i 'm sorry this solution is n't the trick to solving all of these issues . 
  i do know , however , that going to war with all of islam is a fucking stupid idea and will only result in more pain , suffering and misery for everyone . 
  why do n't you ask one of the many of the muslims that live peacefully in western society everyday ? 
   there was the survey a little while ago that found that over 50 % of uk muslims want to outlaw homosexuality i know this is just for a singular issue , but ' a survey ' does not a good argument make . 
  there are also a significant number of westerners ( although i imagine fewer than muslims ) who think this because of their religious belief , but i hear no talks of them being deported . 
   and this is just in regards to a single issue . 
  what about free speech towards the religion ? 
  we already are seeing some people trying to curtail free speech to appease religious minorities . 
  will these continue ? 
  will we see pressure on ex-muslims to be muzzled so muslims do n't have to hear criticism of their religion from apostates ? 
  will women have to dress more moderately to not offend their traditionally conservative dress norms ? 
  what about limits to where and how we consume alcohol or pork products ? 
  i agree with you that some measures being taken are stupid , but overall i think these are extremes and wo n't happen , and generally any cry from people claiming the government are going to implement sharia law is an overreaction and frankly quite foolish . 
  i believe most muslims are just normal people who want to get on with their lives and wo n't run off to isis just because they saw some lesbians in bikinis . 
  perhaps , in their private life and opinions they disapprove but they 're free to do that all they want , as long as they do n't try to stop it . 
  if someone joins an extremist organisation they might blame it on the surface level on these things but they would almost certainly have underlying deeper issues , possibly to do with mental health in some cases , that need resolving . 
  it 's those people we should be reaching out to and helping and saying `` you need to be better than they [ extremist organisations ] are '' because if we just abandon them it plays into islamists ' hands . 
  sacrificing our freedoms and implementing sharia or sharia-like practices is extreme and not a path i want to go down . 
  but waging war on all of islam and all muslims , despite the fact that the vast majority of them do n't deserve it , is ** just ** as extreme and will just further divide us . 
  it will not help stop terrorist attacks , it will not and islamist extremist groups and it will just cause more pain and suffering . 
  oh , i do n't know , make them feel accepted and a part of the country so they do n't become even more alienated from us and indoctrinated by them ? 
  there 'll always be people who unfortunately slip through the cracks , so we have to minimise it as much as possible . 
  demonising every single muslim will literally do the opposite . 
  also most of them are just like goddamn normal human beings so it would just be the decent thing to do . 
  i suppose . 
  just because they 're the best option right now does n't mean i have to like them though . 
  oh for fuck 's sake i hate this fucking goddamn government sometimes i hate this goddamn country what the fuck, 
  if you do this you will have a lot of innocent people feeling very abandoned and probably angry , even if they were born here and are basically british/european . 
  the most vulnerable ones will be ripe targets for extremist groups . 
  those crazy andorrans !, 
  ... what ? 
  perhaps , but england is simply the easier target . 
  most of the aristocracy and government in britain , who were responsible for much of the turmoil in ireland , were english ( and still are ! ) . 
  england is the dominant force in the uk , and is frequently seen to be some sort of overlord-type figure to the other three countries in pop culture . 
  plus ireland and scotland have a lot in common : both celtic nations with originally celtic languages that have been replaced by english for the most part . 
  ireland and scotland have a shared history of migration , like you said . 
  and contempt for the english is not an uncommon opinion in both countries . 
  all british countries contributed , and still do , to the uk . 
  but with the capital being in england , the biggest country in terms of area and population , it 's hard for many people , english or otherwise , to not see england as this domineering amorphous blob of power . 
  much of the contempt held by some irish people is indeed aimed towards english people specifically , yes ( or more accurately , the current government which generally represents english people more than everyone else ) . 
  yes . 
  these women can - and do - think for themselves ( unless they are in the awful position of having all aspects of their life controlled by someone else ) . 
  if they get up and choose to wear this based on any reasoning , the ones you mentioned or otherwise , who actually cares ? 
  * all ? 
  * no , i am not naive . 
  but i do know that many do have the choice , and choose it in fact !, 
  this is just a random person in the background of a photo ( who i 'm still not 100 % convinced is actually wearing a burqa but whatevs ) so i could not possibly comment on their circumstances . 
   genuine refugees from western europe my fucking sides . 
  please someone help i am literally dying of laughter, 
  yes , where people from around the world are welcome to live and dress however they choose , 
  my evidence * is * anecdotal , true . 
  but just go to / r/transgender , / r/asktransgender , / r/transtimelines or any other trans sub to see what actual trans people think . 
  i 'm sure there are some who would favour your option , but it seems to me like most of them would n't agree . 
  surely that 's up to the individual ? 
  trans people i 've known are always far more comfortable with themselves when they begin passing and/or have surgery . 
  is that not better for everyone ? 
  if that 's a sexual encounter then any decent person would inform you before anything happened . 
  if they did n't then the problem is n't that they 're trans , it 's that they 're an asshole for not telling you . 
  if it 's not a sexual context then who * actually * cares ? 
  unless you 're fucking them what difference does it make ? 
  depends entirely on your definition of ` man ' and ` woman ', 
  god save the queen, 
  there is not a significant number of ginger teens committing suicide because of their hair colour . 
  definitely , but there is a definite stigma in schools about being in the lgbt community even in fairly liberal places . 
  you can definitely be picked on for being tall , but it 's not nearly as big an issue . 
  yeah but by saying half of romania will come we can make them seem like evil job-stealing , welfare-leaching , nhs-breaking problems for great britannia !, 
  ah yes , eastern europe . 
  the known beacon of athiesm , 
  because the government and media have blamed immigrants for loads of our problems that either had very little or nothing at all to do with immigrants , because it 's easy to shift the blame onto a group of people and use them as scapegoats . 
  the actual group changes all the time : it used to be blacks from the caribbean , then indians/pakistanis , then polish , now romanians/bulgarians .
