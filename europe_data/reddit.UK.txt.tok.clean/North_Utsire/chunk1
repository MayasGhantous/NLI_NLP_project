do russian media go for satirical caricatures ? 
  it 'd be interesting to see their take on it if so . 
  http://www.buzzfeed.com/jonstone/scottish-nationalists-who-reacted-really-badly-to-jk-rowl `` j k rowling ya better together unite the union cow bag arsehole cunt ye '' the scots nationalism crowd reacting as one might expect . 
  it 's not political correctness so much as it 's political neutrality , which is entirely fair as it 's not really google 's place to offer an opinion on geopolitical disputes . 
  that 's completely irrelevant to a discussion about britain joining schengen . . ? 
  it 's also just a dumb comment in its own right . 
  yes , it was . 
  [ this chart ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/07/daily-chart-13?zid=295&amp;ah=0bca374e65f2354d553956ea65f756e0 ) from the economist shows that during the recession , british unemployment figures grew at roughly half the rate of the eurozone as a whole . 
  the netherlands , who are also mentioned in this post , did even better . 
  their unemployment rate actually fell slightly from 2007-2012 . 
  the desire to help people is understandable , but this will only encourage yet more people to attempt the mediterranean crossing and cause yet more people to needlessly lose their lives . 
  if you 're going to continue with this absurd and impractical solution at least keep it up to date . 
  1500 migrants attempted to breach channel tunnel again last night . 
  one person died . 
  it 's the biggest story in the uk by a country mile and the only mention of it up there is yesterday 's news . 
  do n't pretend you 're unaware of it either because you deleted the post i made about it just as it was gathering steam . 
  you should just admit that megathreads are a hugely unpopular , failed solution and get rid . 
  hoping this topic is n't sent down the megathread memory hole by the mods . 
  the situation in calais is developing into a crisis all of its own and deserves to be discussed within its own context . 
  yes . 
  by all means , give aid and fuel if they need it . 
  give them a new boat if we must . 
  just do n't give them an open route to europe , because that will only encourage the problem . 
  they may not , but that 's the risk the migrants take . 
  it sounds cold and heartless , but unless europe takes a harsh stance on this issue , more and more migrants will attempt to make the crossing . 
  the only way to stem the tide is to remove the incentive . 
  we do n't have to ship them back to libya , we just need to prevent them from landing in europe . 
  turn them back in the mediterranean and let them choose their own destination from there . 
  per four years , surely , if the dates are 2009/2013 ? 
  so ~ 0.04 days per person per year , or one in 50 people going on strike for a day each year . 
  possibly a stupid question , but i do n't understand the `` per 1000 people '' part of this figure . 
  are france 's 171 days a cumulative man-hour stat among those 1000 people ? 
  if so that does n't seem bad at all - that 's an absolutely tiny proportion of the ~ 1.4 mil days shared between them across this four-year time period . 
  if it 's an average per-person stat of those 1000 , why not just call it per-person and what 's the relevancy of the 1000 people ? 
  remember , it 's a bannable offence to discuss cultural and religious issues in this sub . 
  as this thing that happened obviously has nothing to do with the culture or religion of those involved , it must be caused by something else . 
  perhaps the migrants supported different football teams ? 
  source them then . 
  i give up . 
  you 're making up your own quotes and getting angry about them *** again *** . 
  come back to me when you can find a source for your ` gas ' quote . 
  until then you 're being a moron . 
   `` the cultures are incompaitable and they ca n't integrate '' change `` ca n't '' to `` do n't '' and this is demonstrably true . 
  no they do n't . 
  nobody on this thread is asking for that . 
  what people want are sensible controls on immigration . 
  you 're inventing a mindset that literally nobody has and getting angry about it . 
  stop . 
   but people still are n't minorly discouraged from sayiong `` lets gas all the paki terrorists ! '', 
  so clearly freeze peach is leterally being denied . 
  are you drunk ? 
  the uk literally imprisons people for internet thought crimes . 
  because the vast majority are in it for social media attention , and you do n't get internet points unless you 're shitting on straight white men . 
   incompetent idiots who can not do what is actually needed has mutti seen them yet ? 
  i 'm sorry that you felt that way . 
  it 's not a personal comment , please do n't take it as such . 
  i understand that there are many germans who feel annoyed at the situation , and they are as much a victim of this crisis as anyone . 
  perhaps more so . 
  ` they ' in the context of my original post refers to the german government and those who vote for their damaging policies . 
   the other issue is that germany was one of the few countries to recognise that this is not a problem they can no longer ignore . 
  was the double negative intended ? 
  if so you 're correct ; a failed refugee policy causing europe to destabilise * is * something germany continues to ignore . 
  every country in europe is saying `` no more '' , but so long as germany keeps unilaterally offering riches to those who cross our borders they will keep having an incentive to do so . 
  especially if german authorities do n't even bother to check if the people they allow in have a right to be here . 
   is probably captured tens of thousands of real passports . 
   the `` welt am sonntag '' reported that the terrorist militia islamic state ( is ) in syria , has allegedly looted tens of thousands of genuine passport documents in iraq and libya . 
  the head of the eu border protection agency frontex , fabrice leggeri , warned : `` the large flows of people who are currently uncontrolled traveling to europe , of course , also represent a security risk . '', 
  at least two of the assassins of paris had to register as refugees in greece . 
  the thought of isis sending potentially thousands of soldiers to germany with stolen passports , and for germany to not even check 90 % of them is ** terrifying ** . 
  why is n't germany now checking who they take in ? 
  they invited these individuals in the first place - can germany just not be fucked , or are they prepared to admit they 've completely lost control of the situation ? 
  either way , the gross naivety and negligence germany is taking with its refugee policy is putting all of europe in grave danger . 
  what ? 
  of course it can happen . 
  australia has this agreement already with png . 
  europe could absolutely negotiate the same with a country in africa . 
  there 's nothing about a declining population which is unmanagable . 
  solutions to bring up birth rates and bring down later-life dependency will require change , but it 's nothing we ca n't cope with . 
  you know what is umanageable ? 
  the civil unrest and the permanent destruction of european identity that comes with the complete , unprecedented replacement of an entire continent 's people in just a few short decades . 
  whatever . 
  / u/lorddutch 's observations are completely valid and it 's a very serious issue . 
  do n't just make trite comparisons to american politicians as some lazy form of ad-hominem , even as part of a lame overused reddit joke . 
  bullshit , over 75 % of the uk is dedicated to agricultural use ( ie farmed , managed and important to the uk economy ) and the remaining land share is mostly urban . 
  a very small proportion of uk land is 'em pty ' . 
  not that land being 'em pty ' is even an argument for more immigration . 
  yes , the solution to the current housing crisis is to build more houses , but why on earth would you want to make the problem worse ? 
  and so were we . 
  all that the continuation of the crisis will show is that the german government had no idea what they were starting when they invited the whole world to europe , and that now they do n't know how to stop it . 
  nope . 
  germany set this crisis in motion but stopping it wo n't be nearly as easy . 
  if two thirds of an electorate are ganging up on a minority to specifically deny that minority a voice , it means the minority is completely disenfranchised from the political system . 
  it 's called the ` tyranny of the majority ' . 
  on this scale it 's extremely undemocratic and is sure to store up resentment in the long term . 
  2,000 staff against an onslaught that numbers in the millions every year . 
  such a joke . 
  what powers will this team even have ? 
  the current coastguard operation literally only exists to help traffickers reach europe when they get into trouble in the med . 
  they 're practically working together to worsen the problem . 
  many people have pointed out the anti-western undercurrent that 's pervasive in islam , and some have argued that this legitimises those muslims who do openly support isis , but nobody thinks that each and every muslim is an isis member .
