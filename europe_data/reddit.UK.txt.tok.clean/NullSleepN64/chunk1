i ca n't see us getting a world cup in my lifetime . 
  i think every other country has to host it at least 3 times before we can have another crack at it . 
  germany . 
  i do n't know how to feel . 
  they 're joking dude . 
  chill out . 
  maybe ... maybe we could team up for this one . 
  i only care because one of the original exemplifications of it is about a third of a mile from me and my city does n't really have anything else !, 
  depends on the brand , but on average it 's around # 3.50 for 12.5 g , # 6.50 for 25g or # 12.50 for a 50g . 
  add a couple of pounds on top of each if you smoke golden virginia . 
  then papers are about 40p a pack and filters are about # 1 . 
  it 's gone up a lot recently but it works out a lot cheaper . 
  i used to smoke malbroro cigarettes . 
  when i started in 2005 they were around # 4 ( $ 4.68 ) for a pack of 20 . 
  in my local shops they 're now at # 8.79 ( $ 10.28 ) . 
  it 's pretty much purely tax . 
  the fuck ? 
  we usually give you 12 and get a 4/6 in return . 
   five of them took a homemade bomb to an edl rally in dewsbury , west yorkshire , last june but arrived after it ended . 
  they sound like the shittiest terrorists ever . 
  whoops !, 
  i need to learn to read better . 
   you are protesting for yourself , because you would rather put all the pressure on future generations i completely agree with you . 
  it 's already happened to most of us . 
  i turned 18 in 2008 just as everything went to shit . 
  no one my age could get a job , a lot still ca n't . 
  all because the generation ( s ) above us completely fucked us over . 
  if these same generations refuse to change , i dread to think how bad it will be for our grandchildren . 
  not arguing or disagreeing with you , but could you elaborate why ? 
  who is he ? 
  wow , thanks for replying . 
  you 're quite right , luxembourg is such a strange entity . 
  i also had no idea they had so many portuguese . 
  150,000 people a day ? 
  surely that 's unsustainable ? 
  so it 's not chicks with dicks ? 
  they 're savages on the continent you know . 
  especially the blasted french . 
  that and the rest of the country is actually quite nice . 
  well most of it . 
  you never go full retard . 
  yeah , we should be grateful of all the agriculture and farmland london has ... can the rest of us secede with scotland ? 
   there are , in fact , twice as many benefit claimants from `` old '' europe as there are from `` new '' europe . 
  ( the article seems to think that europe should n't be capitalised ) . 
  i do n't give a shit where they come from , if you move to any country purely to claim benefits then you 're a waste of space regardless of nationality . 
  come here to work ? 
  brilliant , more power to you and i 'll buy you a beer . 
  i just hate the fact that i work my arse off in a 9-5 so i can pay for people who do absolutely nothing to live . 
  that goes for brits here too . 
  ( just to add that i do believe in benefits for people who * genuinely * ca n't work due to disability etc ) . 
  this is exactly it , and personally i do n't want to eat horse . 
  to me it feels the same as eating a dog or a cat . 
  i really do n't care that other people are happy to eat horse , i 'm not and i do n't like being lied to about what i 'm eating . 
  very true , i was meaning more in an ideal world . 
  most of it comes down to who you know at that level anyway . 
  the first place that got busted for it had a 100 % guarantee that all beef was from britain and ireland . 
  they were just importing it anyway . 
  i dread to think how widespread this actually is and how many places are importing meat from the rest of europe without checking what 's in it . 
  it should be based on who 's best for the job , regardless of gender . 
  i 'm not sure thailand knows exactly what this ` gender ' term is . 
  a lot of ( certainly not all ) americans really need to get over themselves . 
  are people making a fuss about this ? 
  they spell colour correctly and do n't go around trashing the place . 
  good enough for me . 
  at least it 's a big one . 
  he 's still a dick either way . 
  the good child . 
  we only have 20 odd left to get . 
  then we have to fight the elite four . 
  how about we take them now ? 
  then if you have a major financial crisis in a few hundred years you can use them as a nationalist distraction . 
  that 's if you buy really poor quality food . 
  if i want chicken i can go out and buy a whole fresh one for less than # 5 . 
  still there 's no excuse for any of it . 
  if it was the 50 's then maybe . 
  to be honest i 'm probably just spoiled . 
  because the packet says beef . 
  you know how in china they eat dogs , that 's what the thought of eating horse is like to me . 
  it 's just cultural i guess . 
  in this day and age , no food sold in uk supermarkets should be ` eat at your own risk ' . 
  that makes so much sense it 's unreal . 
  i always assumed it was a kind of food . 
  feeling pretty stupid now . 
  i do n't know what sklep is , but it does n't sound pleasant . 
  anyway they get enough business because there 's [ 5000 of them in our city . 
  ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/interactive/2012/dec/13/census-2011-truth-where-you-live-interactive?fb=native#e07000138 ), 
  we 'd be fine , the yanks would sink their own boats and then invade canada for some reason . 
  easier just to claim it 's fake : https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpected/comments/4bazqo/an_unlikely_hero_emerges_when_migrants_attack_an/d17qbad, 
   50 % pkk + 30 % dhkp-c + 15 % isis + 5 % sounds like the ingredients of a legal high, 
  that 's what ireland actually looks like . 
  you 've been fed too much nasa propaganda . 
  / r/uk is more pc and leftist than tumblr . 
  no joke , i thought you all hated us, 
  so are you , 
  `` why does germany have two flags ? '', 
  but they 're in france ... 
  surely we do the same thing to the people desperatly trying to illegaly cross into france ? 
  that 's literally what we 're doing . 
  you 've confused me here , is the slum in calais what you 'd consider as accepting refugees ? 
  i base all my opinions on eurovision results .
