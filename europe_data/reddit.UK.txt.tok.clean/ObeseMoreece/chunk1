so his fears are unjustified, 
  as in it 's a constant source . 
  it 's always running which is why we need it for baseload supplies you tit . 
  why ? 
   storage technology it can be exploited but not everywhere . 
  for example , you can pump water in to a reservoir at night when energy is cheaper then just use the water to generate power during the day . 
  i 'm pretty sure scotland does this in some places but places like the netherlands do n't have that kind of opportunity . 
  if you mean batteries then you have no business in saying nuclear is too expensive . 
  come on salmond , you left with your dignity , do n't ruin it now . 
  no , it 's a simple majority system and there was a clear winner . 
  quebec 's referendum results in a no vote by less than 0.6 % , there was still a clear winner . 
  he ca n't now . 
  he 's promised all uk nations devolved powers , including england . 
  backtracking on the one that caused it would cause a shit storm and his political career would be over . 
  no , he 's right considering he has said england will get its own devolved powers . 
  it would be the end of his and many other 's political careers . 
  he promised all 4 nations of the uk that they would gain devolved powers while also representing the other 2 major parties . 
  it would be bad enough for him to go back in devolution for scotland but for the whole uk ? 
  he 'd have no hope of any future support . 
  i knew 3 latvians , one was a really quiet guy and the other 2 were the hot ones . 
  that 's good enough for me . 
   everything is run by the austrians i thought you all hated being ruled by the austrians , you know with that huge empire and all . 
  confirmed , know 2 hot latvians . 
  then again , ukraine and the czechs seem to produce a shit ton of pornstars . 
  i 'm glad you put the worst one first . 
  ukraine was a nation under russia 's influence before the rebels overthrew the ( democratically elected ) government . 
  ukraine was n't in any position of protection from anyone . 
  you know , it is uncertain whether or not we 'd be prepared to go to ww3 over somewhere like latvia but can russia really afford to gamble when mutually assured destruction is at stake ? 
  it is deluded purely because russia knows they ca n't get away with attacking a nato nation . 
  do eastern europeans really have this deluded fear that russia would attack a nato member ? 
  france does n't let politics get in the way of its business , that 's how you lose customers . 
  no , this is just a pathetic excuse to make fun of putin . 
  well i 'm happy that you end the argument like this rather than calling me a shill , scum , fascist , communist , child , child killer or jew . 
  a distaste for napoleon ? 
  it also does n't matter if many people do n't like russia , that does n't mean the rest of us should put up with childish propaganda . 
  i 'd say it 's more like he does n't want to rely on the west . 
  if he was isolating russia from the world he would never be opening more trade with china . 
  do you have evidence that russia shot down the flight ? 
  what threats ? 
  the ukrainian civil war was caused by euromaiden ( i will admit that russia backed the separatists but i see that as no different from the usa backing syrian rebels ) . 
  crimeans want to be part of russia no matter which way you spin it . 
  the potential restart of the cold war ? 
  that 's entirely up to how much more sanctions the west wants to impose . 
  you can tell that most / r/europe would make the worst diplomats . 
  belittling powerful people because you disagree with them is just childish . 
  i think they should have , they should be left to themselves now . 
  shithole of a country made worse by jumped up rebels . 
   the ukrainian people obviously wanted the agreement with the eu no , the people who rebelled wanted the agreement . 
  what would ukraine get if it did sign it ? 
  a * chance * at membership in 20-30 years ** if ** they got their economy out of the shitter ? 
  what makes you think the possible eu support would be so much better than guaranteed support from russia ? 
  ukraine was too poor to join and will be for much longer now because of those rebels . 
  europe does n't need ukraine but ukraine needs someone who *** will *** help them . 
  why is it not a good argument ? 
  do you think that ukraine would only do well under european influence ? 
  ukraine was about to undergo a deal for russia to economically support the poor nation and euromaiden chewed that deal up and spat it in russia 's face when they were the only ones offering help . 
  if the eu supported peace and stability then then they would denounce euromaiden for causing chaos in ukraine . 
  without euromaiden ukraine would be stable , tensions with russia would be much smaller and it would generally be a better political climate . 
  ukraine has been influenced by russia since its independence . 
  i was n't aware that we 've been living in fear of what russia will do with influence over ukraine for the past 23 years . 
  it was n't until western rebels interfered that trouble started . 
  i believe that russia would have been well within their rights to restore the democratically elected president ( yanukovich ) and restore order . 
  the rebels may be pro west but all that they have done is made the country poorer and lessened any chance of being able to join the eu . 
  and what will heal ? 
  russia 's been getting better and better since putin took charge . 
  just because you disagree with some of his actions does n't mean he 's bad for russia . 
  lel look , putin is le evil !, 
  it 's not for russia hate and propaganda either . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2boqwc/caricatures_of_putin_under_the_hashtag_putinkills/ there you go . 
  blatant propaganda from someone who openly admitted that they will ignore any opposing arguments/opinions . 
  and russia can do exactly the same to europe by shutting the gas off . 
  europe has no business or interests in ukraine , it 's not worth the losses just because you feel like saying you 're better . 
  why would you want to throw away a perfectly capable leader and throw an extremely important nation in to chaos ? 
  why is this being upvoted ? 
  is this sub so blatantly biased against putin that they 're willing to upvote putin getting pooped on by a bird during a fucking speech about ww1 ? 
  so you advocate for the occupation of a ( nuclear ) state because you do n't like how they treat gays . 
  the thing is , it 's difficult to apply that analogy to gays since they have been persecuted around most of the world of centuries . 
  i suppose the jews went through something similar with the various expulsions but gays were always see as something akin to possessed in christendom . 
  i do n't agree with their persecution but it 's ultimately up to russians to decide how they run their country . 
  comparing the nazi party 's treatment of jews to the treatment of gays in russia is an insult to the jews . 
  there are n't any gay ghettos in russia are there ? 
  the difference is that beating up gays is n't carried out by the state . 
   arresting gay rights activists that would be because the law specifically prohibits the spread of ` gay propaganda ' . 
  is that state sanctioned ? 
  no , there is n't much that the rest of the world can do . 
  you will see some pro-israel threads but that 's only when something blatantly shows that hamas are not good ( i.e. 
  the north koreans agreeing to sell them weapons ) . 
  pro-palestinians do n't argue over details that contradict their views , they just do n't talk about them . 
  you have got to be shitting me . 
  i am pro-russia and i love discussing/arguing on that sub but to find anyone who agrees with me i need to go to the bottom of every thread . 
  so what if russians tend not to like gays ? 
  you ca n't just go in to a country and tell them that the majority of them are wrong . 
  the people occupied by germany would fucking wish that they had putin . 
  do not compare the two just because you do n't like both of them . 
  no but you can post blatant propaganda aimed against russia and watch it get upvoted while posting the opposite propaganda just gets you people calling you a racist shill . 
  this place is already a circlejerk , now it will get even worse . 
  fascism = / = racism and anti-semitism . 
  he personally shot it . 
  he also rode a bear from moscow to the launch site which was towing a wagon with the buk launcher , rockets and 600 bottles of vodka ( rumours indicate that it was orphan tears and not vodka ) . 
  the term is subjective on this site .
