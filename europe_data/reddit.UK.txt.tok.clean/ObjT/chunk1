my post was full of reality . 
  the uk is nothing to be smug about , but it 's not exactly irrelevant either . 
  i would n't call 36-14 % with a university degree skilled labour . 
  how many of those degrees are useful degrees from decent universities ? 
  about 50 % of people graduating secondary school in the uk will go on to take a degree . 
  in finland it 's around 70-80 % . 
  this all secondary anyway , since the original comment was that the housing market for eu and outside eu immigrants does not conflate , which is wrong . 
  houses are bought once assets are accrued . 
  many skilled workers have not accrued those assets for better places . 
  what are the ages of these immigrants ? 
  are they young students wanting to start their lives , or older generations dissatisfied with their own country ? 
  i 'm not sure myself , i have n't looked into it . 
  french immigration into germany is very low . 
  18th on the list : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany#immigrant_population_in_germany_by_country_of_birth, 
  people need to learn that being ` offended ' should only affect their personal opinions of others , and not society as a whole . 
  yes , it is assumption . 
  i would consider it a safe assumption to make when you consider the housing markets in europe . 
  depends whether it 's skilled or unskilled labour coming from the eu . 
  you could be right ; i could be right . 
  we 'll have to wait and see what happens in the coming years . 
  that is true . 
  however eu immigration will slow down substantially from the effects of taking immigrants from the middle east ( housing capacity and such ) . 
  you presume they will contribute . 
  refugees are supposed to go back anyway . 
  [ immigrants from outside europe cost the uk 120bn .

  the imf estimates that in 2020 the gap will narrow to around 0.365 trillion : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_imf_ranked_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_ ( nominal ) #imf _ estimates_for_2020 [ cebr ] ( http://www.cebr.com/reports/world-economic-league-table-2015/ ) states that the uk will overtake germany in 2030 .

  the uk is the second highest net contributor to the eu , second largest economy in europe and its trade deficit means it supports a lot of trade in the eu . 
  the uk is set to be the largest economy in europe by 2030 . 
  london is consistently ranked as highest for global power , ahead of places like new york . 
  london is consistently rated 1st/2nd as the top place to do finance in the world . 
  the uk spends the most on defence in the eu , one of the few countries to abide by the nato 2 % requirement ( germany and france are below this contractual requirement ) . 
  that alone helps secure eu sovereignty . 
  the uk acts as a bridge between countries like australia/canada/new zealand and the eu . 
  the uk is very important to the eu . 
  to label it as anything other is disingenuous . 
  yes , i believe iq is mostly genetic , with a bit of culture on top . 
  from what i have seen , ashkenazi jews push their children into academic subjects from an early age . 
  whether this causes an iq difference to flourish , or is possible from a natural aptitude , is difficult to ascertain . 
  my opinion is that it is mostly culture as the genetics of ashkenazi jews is extremely similar to other population groups , and not that much distinct . 
  i 'm justing adding more to the conversation ... you are taking away . 
  nurture/nature is important to find out . 
  if it 's culture , then it is replicable . 
  great . 
  if it 's innate then there is not much you can do . 
  i 'm expanding on the original point by adding my opinion . 
  it does n't necessarily indicate increased aptitude . 
  iq tests measure shallow logic . 
  and the differences are largely attributable to culture . 
  it 's often murky , and not very clear cut . 
  even if an outlet has been shown to falsely report , there is no repercussion . 
  if you 're worried that there wo n't be verifiable context alongside liveleak videos ( which i think alone is not at all a problem ) , you must realise that you will always be relying on witness accounts and the like . 
  a news organisation has no means of corroborating the context with anything other . 
  one way or another , you 're relying on a stranger to tell the truth . 
  people can make their own decisions on what is true and what is false . 
  considering the main objective of modern journalism is n't to inform , but to sell , the number of compromised articles floating around is n't surprising . 
  in fact , when talking about an event , news organisations have no incentive to tell the truth . 
  they can not be sued for libel in such scenarios . 
  there are no news outlets that have a 100 % track record . 
   you 're essentially relying on a random reddit user to tell the truth you 're always trusting somebody to tell the truth , no matter the link . 
  what shitty logic . 
  as long as it is n't recorded , some human will have to relay the information . 
  whether that 's some bystander , editor or journalist , they can always be lying . 
  its continued poisoning of university establishments . 
  getting scientists sacked for innocuous comments about women in labs . 
  making respected scientists cry on live tv by harassing them for wearing a shirt with women on it . 
  getting laws implemented in several countries to deal with the ' `` wage gap '' ' - that which has been debunked by many economic studies . 
  subsidising female scholarships and positive discrimination to get more women into stem , and now that it has slipped the other way , forgoing those same measures . 
  more poisoning of secondary education to actively cater to girls ; to also respond negatively to boyish behavior . 
  changing domestic violence laws such that men are always taken to the police station , even when they are the victim . 
  i could go on . 
  if you want an echochamber , you can find it in many other places . 
  / r/europe is a default for europeans . 
  it should not show any bias in moderation between political views . 
  the homeless already are given hostel accommodation free of charge . 
  homeless people can register to live in a state hostel for free in the uk . 
  i would consider a small fraction more than 1/100 . 
  the amount of earth covered by photovoltaics is likely around 1/100000000 . 
  you have shown me nothing . 
  if you are surprised at me talking about the creation of hydrogen , then do n't join a comment thread about that very thing . 
   the world 's gon na progress regardless of your dislike of solar energy . 
  no , the world will adopt fusion energy from projects like iter and jet , not archaic systems like light collection supported by idiots with little to no grasp of science . 
  for the time being fission is far better than any ` renewable energy ' system seen today . 
  the only reason renewable energy is supported is due to the fact stupid people like the idea of it , completely neglecting the production of such devices creates a lot of greenhouse gasses , whilst the devices themselves are extremely inefficient . 
  firstly , that graph/page lists * capacity * , which is far off actual operating power ( probably about 10 % of that is power used ) . 
  this is comparatively tiny compared to other means of production . 
  secondly , we are still no where near capable of covering even a small fraction of the earth with photovoltaics . 
  what we have now is a smidgen , and usually that space is over other objects ( house roofs and such which has limited capacity ) . 
  thirdly , the price of solar power is terrible compared to other means . 
  it is a terrible investment . 
  powering nations with photovoltaics would run you at 30-40x the prices of using nuclear . 
  fourthly , splitting water takes a lot of energy . 
  in fact , it takes a lot more energy than you get out of it when the hydroxy mixture is burnt . 
  big companies are not interested in photovoltaic means for it is wildly inefficient , and takes up significant space ( also costly ) . 
  fifthly , photovoltaics only have value in places where it is bright , and reliably so . 
  they 're not very useful in many areas . 
  wake me up when we have enough resources and production capacity to cover even a small fraction of that . 
  not necessarily . 
  the amount of energy delivered by the sun is a hard limit .
