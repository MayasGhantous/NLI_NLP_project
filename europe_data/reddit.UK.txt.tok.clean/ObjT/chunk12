  often due to blanket templates that they use to create the website . 
  it does n't inform you of anything . 
  facebook has a horrendous privacy policy , but the cookie popup should not be conflated with that . 
  the eu should have spent the money they took pushing it through parliament on the creation of a browser that allows you to accept and reject certain cookies , and inform you of the ones that track you . 
  much better solution that a shitty popup that has never prompted anyone to leave a website . 
  it is true , you can see it in the poll breakdowns . 
  it 's why the snp were trying to lower the voting age to sixteen . 
  i will tell you that , because it 's absolutely true . 
  our main service , finance , is not part of the single market . 
  we are not getting a sweet deal , as i 've mentioned in other comments . 
  the amount of manufacturing lost compared with the little gains in the service sector gives us net losses in this regard . 
  to be honest , i did n't realise most of them were pro-union . 
  i was more referring to the online content posted on / r/scotland up to the referendum . 
  if we break this down : `` currently a uk license on financial services like the provision of e-money , can be passported into the rest of the eea '' . 
  * passported should n't be used as a verb here , as the company technically needs to provide a separate service under a passport licence than a uk licence . 
  * a uk licence does not mean automatic acceptance for a credit passport . 
  * no mention that the provision of e-money is still subject to national regulations . 
  if we go back to your original point that the uk 's financial industry has benefited off the single market - that 's completely untrue . 
  it 's only a recent thing that financial regulations have lessened . 
  and even then , they are still far too much at the national level to be considered part of a single financial market . 
  currently a uk license on financial services like the provision of e-money , can be passported into the rest of the eea ** ^ ** subject ^ to ^ local ^ regulation ^ bodies . 
  yeah , both sides had loud people , but i 'd have to say overall most of the loud ones were from the ` yes ' camp . 
  just reading scottish media smacked of vitriol for people voting ` no ' . 
  going around scotland you would see ` yes ' plastered everywhere , not so much ` no ' . 
  paid adverts for ` no ' were defaced as well . 
  it 's probably because the younger people are louder . 
  you see it all the time in normal politics as well ; younger people are loud . 
  perhaps it 's why you would n't guess ` leave ' is as strong in the polls as it is . 
   you 're not disagreeing with me ? 
  that 's what i put . 
  `` they 're literally operating in the uk with a german banking license '' is not `` they are operating in the uk with a european passport for credit institutions . 
  they are also registered with the british financial conduct authority ( british regulators ) . '', 
   because they have a european license they do n't need to apply for further authorisations . 
  `` the firm will still be regulated by its home state regulator '' as in `` fuck with our regulations and we will withdraw your authorisations '' so yes , i am majorly disagreeing with you . 
  i 'm still right , and you 're wrong . 
  i 'll forgive you if you vote leave . 
   they 're literally operating in the uk with a german banking license ** wrong ** : they are operating in the uk with a european passport for credit institutions . 
  they are also registered with the british financial conduct authority ( british regulators ) . 
   ibans are n't sepa , never said they were , but the ibans issued in the uk are sepa compliant . 
   eu for e-money and payment services , yes it is , it comes under the exact same legislation ** wrong ** : http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/pages/authorisations/passporting/default.aspx `` a firm from an eea state can passport into another eea state on either a ` services ' ( in which it does not have a physical presence in the country it is passporting into ) or a ` branch ' ( in which the firm opens another office in the country it is passporting into ) basis . 
  either way , in most circumstances , * the firm will still be regulated by its home state regulator . 
  * ''  finance is my job go fuck yourself working tills is n't finance mate . 
   the single market is n't about lack of regulation , it 's about unified regulation . 
  and quite clearly , from your previous example fidor , that 's not the case . 
  fine in germany , not so much the uk . 
  different countries have different regulators with different objectives . 
   the psr is about our domestic payment systems , such as faster payments and the likes no . 
  it 's to do with infrastructure . 
  this is an important distinction . 
   that is the byproduct of us not being on the euro and therefore only needing to use sepa . 
  i have no idea what you 're trying to say here , but the uk is very much part of sepa and in fact only issues sepa ibans . 
   fidor was n't having issues with the uk regulators , it was having problems getting a bank to provide it correspondent services to do things like have a sort code . 
  if this is your understanding , it is not a very good one . 
  a passport licence for finance is no where near the same level as a national one . 
  i 'm not sure how i can give you any more confirmation that europe does not have a single market for financial services other than a gov.uk link . 
  i work in finance . 
  this is my job . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  none of those things point to a financial single market . 
  in fact , the opposite . 
  you need explicit permission to commit to very specific activities . 
  some of those activities are under national protection , and even the activities that can be permitted are under national regulation . 
  in fact , your example for fidor is against you since it 's in hot water over uk regulators ( like the psr ) . 
  https://letstalkpayments.com/digital-bank-fidor-is-facing-serious-issues-for-its-uk-launch/ https://www.psr.org.uk/about-psr/psr-purpose i 'm afraid what you 've been saying is complete misinformation . 
  i do n't think the switch was a purely conscious decision . 
  we are dealing with trillions of economy here , and it 's not very easy to just change its configuration within a relatively small amount of time . 
  industry in the uk has been lost over the years due to equal parts incompetence from our government , and equal parts foreign competition , i 'd say . 
  i 'm sure it 's up for debate . 
  now you say that austria , poland and the czech republic are integrated into the german automotive supply chain , which is true as of now . 
  however , as time progresses it will become cheaper and cheaper to move an expansive supply chain into one singular point as logistical burden and throughput will be mitigated . 
  you will see it within germany , too . 
  some areas will become very rich and other areas poor . 
  industry just naturally gravitates to one point with increased automation . 
  it 's therefore better to encourage manufacturing to spread out by use of import tax imo . 
  incorrect . 
  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/332874/2902400_boc_freedomofcapital_acc.pdf `` the creation of a single market in financial services in the eu requires member states to remove obstacles to the purchase and sale of financial services . 
  many of these obstacles are national rules that have been developed to maintain financial stability , protect consumers and ensure markets operate fairly and cleanly . 
  removing these barriers to trade necessarily requires there to be effective eu-level rules instead . '', 
  this is a report from 2014 detailing how they could create a single market for financial services . 
  it is not what currently happens . 
  the single market does not directly apply to financial services , so i disagree strongly with that . 
  you 're right that undecided will definitely mess with the result on the day , but by what degree is up for debate . 
  there are a couple differences from the eu referendum . 
  with the scottish referendum , the ` yes ' supporters were very loud and aggressive to people voting ` no ' , and consequently the ` no ' vote was the ` shy vote ' meaning it was underrepresented in the polls . 
  the difference is that the ` shy vote ' here seems to be in the leave camp . 
  another point is that the older folk were voting ` no ' in the scottish referendum - a group that is generally underrepresented in polling . 
  the older folk are in support of leaving the eu this time around , so possibly this might be a cause of inaccuracy in the polls . 
  whilst i could be very wrong , i do n't think that we will see a similar effect to what we saw in the scottish independence vote . 
  services are much less affected by the single market than , say manufacturing . 
  this is due to the disparity in skilled labour needed for both activities . 
  now britain is primarily a service economy . 
  whilst i 'm sure that britain gained a little bit from the single market in services , it lost a lot more in industry which should be the crux of a large economy ( how it affects ppp is really important ) . 
  i would therefore argue that britain has had net losses overall from the single market . 
  the city of london did not become a finance centre due to the single market . 
  the services that they offer are not directly influenced by the single market . 
  however , manufacturing is directly influenced by the single market , and that 's where britain could do with having some import tax to help nurture its domestic industry . 
  right now , it 's cheaper to manufacture in germany and ship to the uk . 
  that sends our ppp to the dumps . 
  i mean the uk 's nominal gdp per capita is higher than germany , but when ppp adjusted , it 's lower . 
  that is an addressable problem i would like to see addressed .
