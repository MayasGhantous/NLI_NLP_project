  5 due to an open invasion of russia ? 
  the problem is , you have lots of member states with their own set of interests . 
  if russia managed to destroy a few american carrier fleets pre-emptively , weaker countries would not uphold the nato treaty . 
  uk/france/usa / poland would probably uphold the treaty , but it would take more political conciliation . 
  slovenia and the czech republic would not stand a chance without full nato cooperation . 
  at this point usa would probably declare war , and possibly use tactical nukes but this would stop if russia held german cities hostage . 
  all russia 's goal would be in this situation would be taking cities hostage under the threat of atomic destruction . 
  i do n't think russia would go through poland . 
  they would go through ukraine , slovakia and the czech republic . 
  if they break through to germany , they would only need to threaten nuclear annihilation of cities they passed through ( using standard ground bombs ) on the way to keep an uninterrupted supply line . 
  holding part of germany hostage would give them a big voice on the world stage . 
  there 's nothing anyone could do in that situation . 
  there would certainly be no way of avoiding millions of deaths if nato were to launch a counter offensive . 
  i think it 's possible for a russian incursion into germany , but unless they threaten interfering parties with nuclear annihilation , they would crushed pretty quickly when nato counter attacks . 
  the problem with nato is that it is slow , and not very good at quick reactions . 
  if they played their cards right , they could absolutely annex big parts of europe , but it relies on them using their nuclear capability . 
  this would all have to be a surprise attack ( which is very difficult to coordinate , although not beyond impossible with clever management ) . 
  if nato forms a stronghold on the russian border , then russia may as well call it quits . 
  the biggest opposition russia would face on the initial push would be poland and germany . 
  after that they would face france , the uk and usa at which point they would be obliterated without some kind of nuclear threat . 
  i doubt of course this would ever happen . 
  the people in charge in russia much prefer leeching money than waging risky wars . 
  nukes wo n't fall if russia invades germany . 
  i really doubt they will . 
  only russia launching them pre-emptively will start nuclear war . 
  made the ruling using european guidelines . 
  the particular court is irrelevant . 
  he 's really , really old . 
  nothing new here . 
  men have both a greater average iq by about 4 points , and a higher variability . 
  if you discount memory work on an iq test , the difference is around 10-12 points .

  eu revenue would decrease by about 25 % . 
  more in effect since the uk opts out of various programs . 
  what are your qualifications ? 
  ever done the imo ? 
  i 'm currently an undergraduate at cambridge doing mathematics . 
  analysis can largely be presented as calculus , and i 'm not wrong in saying that there were significant british contributions to calculus . 
  if you ever have the opportunity , try a year at cambridge ( if your uni is part of an exchange program ) . 
  you will likely fail that year . 
  geometry is not where the british are most distinguished . 
  look at calculus and number theory . 
  the fact that andrew wiles does n't have a fields medal shows how useless they are for group comparisons . 
  abstract concepts are difficult to compare because no concept is objectively better . 
  you ca n't compare someone working with manifolds to someone working with number theory . 
  you need a common metric to compare . 
  i can tell by your comments that you are completely unfamiliar with mathematics . 
  fields medals are awarded for notable work . 
  this is highly subjective , and pointless for any group comparison . 
  have a look at the french medalists . 
  they are usually awarded for geometry/topology . 
  have a look at the uk medalists ; mostly awarded for pure mathematics . 
  it 's pointless comparing numbers when the concepts are so abstract , if they are even useful . 
  anglo-saxons have done far more than france to advance maths . 
  brits built the way up to modern calculus . 
  i 'd even claim the saxons have done more than france for mathematics . 
  i hope you 're joking . 
  as a mathematician , that french syllabus is about as difficult as a-level . 
  the cambridge source simply lists materials . 
  i can assure you the course at cambridge is very hard . 
  cam students going abroad often note how easy and spoon-fed the material is outside cam , this includes going to french universities . 
  if i had a criticism of cambridge , it would be the material is too difficult and such is extremely variable what you might find in an exam - ( the questions are extremely long and your performance will vary a lot by how you are feeling on the day ) . 
  [ try some stepiii , the cambridge entry exam if you 're feeling bored ] ( http://mathsorchard.weebly.com/uploads/2/7/3/1/27311819/step_paper_3_2014.pdf ) . 
  the trinity college paper is even harder . 
  do n't forget this is before you 've even arrived .

  some of your countrymen have brains . 
  maybe you should leave the country for the good of the average . 
  we 're not funding your shitty club when we 're not part of it . 
  and yes - that 's lifestyle . 
  so really , you do n't know what your talking about . 
  now delete your comments , those bytes could be used for better things . 
  i suppose you can quote me a relevant part , showing that the finance minister is n't just acting in denmark 's selfish interests . 
  oh yeah , that 's right you ca n't . 
  i read the article - you did n't . 
  the legality of the situation is that the uk should n't pay a penny after we 've left the eu . 
  if you do n't like that then you can whine on here , but the real world is n't going to change for your whining . 
  i understand a lot more than you , kid . 
  those funding commitments are per annum , subject to eu membership - suspension of that is a suspension of funding . 
  the uk will do what is legally binding , and what is right . 
  we are n't paying for your future assets . 
  `` denmark says uk must fund its lifestyle '', 
  that 's completely unrelated . 
   go to / r/unitedkingdom lol, 
  is this a joke ? 
  it 's surely a joke . 
  did you miss the whole refugee crisis ? 
  short the market then . 
  see what happens . 
  aaaand he 's drunk again . 
  it 's probably the first time he 's been sober in years . 
  `` the british media '' sure . 
  are you telling me you do n't want the immigrants to outbreed us , our culture to be preserved and our ethnicity to not go extinct ? 
  are you insane ? 
  there 's no goodwill in business . 
  you are a fool if you believe as such . 
  you are an extraordinary individual . 
  a real special person .
