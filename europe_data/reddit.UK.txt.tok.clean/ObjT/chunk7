  this is n't about an asymmetric policy here . 
  this is a tit-for-tat - if our citizens can stay in your bloc , we will allow your citizens to stay in our country - mutual deal . 
  the uk citizens in europe are either/or relatively rich and skilled . 
  meanwhile the vast majority of european citizens in the uk are unskilled labourers . 
  sending everyone back home would benefit the uk long term , not the eu . 
  the uk is only pushing this to be ethical , the eu is being hardball because they do n't want to be seen giving in to our demands whilst wanting to cause maximum upheaval . 
  it 's not about no longer ` looking out ' for us . 
  it 's about being unethical . 
  let 's say you were working for a restaurant , and you want to find a different job elsewhere . 
  when you hand in your resignation , they turn around and tell you that you are blacklisted from the restaurant . 
  they also threaten to tell all your regulars that you were rubbish and not well liked . 
  if you turn around and say that you 'll tell all your friends and family never to go there again , that 's hardly you being malicious , is it ? 
  if the eu were n't trying to blackmail us , it would n't be a problem . 
  you would n't blame someone for standing up to blackmail , would you ? 
  they 're bargaining chips so long as uk citizens are being used as bargaining chips in the eu . 
  it 's only fair . 
   i never said [ ... ] the ira were `` wrong '' either wow . 
  lmao , this is a copypasta willfully blind individual , willing to ignore reason ( literally ) . 
   it really helps reinforce your point when nothing there is relevant . 
   it really helps reinforce your point ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ . 
   it really helps ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ . 
   it what is ` it ' ? 
  oh yeah , the proceeding sentence . 
  without that , the entire sentence would not make sense . 
   that 's both dishonest and fucking retarded . 
  well congratulations , you 're objectively wrong !, 
  so what does that make you ? 
   it cites it in the article . 
  no it does n't . 
  have n't you read it ? 
  how embarrassing . 
   ah , so a poll only counts when it shows what you want it to . 
  not a poll , that 's a typo . 
  it should be obvious within context that it 's a petition that i 'm referring too . 
  so overall you 're wrong , wrong and wrong again . 
  good job lad . 
   yes mate . 
  well done describing the thing you just clicked on . 
  how thick are you ? 
  i said it so my following sentence had context . 
  christ . 
  does `` it really helps reinforce your point when nothing there is relevant . '', 
  make sense by itself ? 
  no it does not . 
   first result : brexit research suggests 1.2 million leave voters regret their choice first result : no citation . 
  second result : anecdotal . 
  third result : poll committed to by salty remainers . 
  yeah , this is looking like a strong and robust set of material . 
   as opposed to every other report ever created on this topic . 
  strong words . 
  prove it . 
  nice link to google . 
  it really helps reinforce your point when nothing there is relevant . 
  meanwhile , that ipsos mori poll that apparently ` showed parity ' actually showed [ more remain voters regretting their vote than leave ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000249525402.jpg?w=817 ) . 
   oh no more xenophobic again , labelling me things i 'm not . 
  just because i voted leave does n't make me a racist . 
  forgive me for seeing the irish flair and thereby assuming you do n't live in the uk . 
   yeah we do actually mate , that 's what experts deal in at places like the bank of england and the british school of economics . 
  you know , economics ? 
  there is no data for the future . 
  if we did , we 'd be living far different lives . 
  the boe makes predictions , not future certainties . 
   try a five-fold increase in race-hate attacks across the board since brexit . 
  five fold ? 
  lmao . 
  nice misinformation . 
  try a 57 % increase . 
  which is tiny , since the original figures were also tiny . 
   you 'll be in a worse position than you are now . 
  short the markets mate !, 
  you 'll be rich !, 
   of course mate , and take all the time you need to convince me . 
  maybe i 'd attempt a month ago , but you lot consistently spew misinformation and insults . 
  even in your last comment , you distorted the facts and called me xenophobic . 
  it 's just too much effort . 
  if you believe , however , that britain will go to the shitter : short the market mate . 
  you 'll make a bloody fortune . 
  a single market is merely regulatory homogeneity without tariffs . 
  that 's all . 
  iceland has a unified market , not a single market . 
   and backed by financial data no . 
  we have no data for the future . 
   there 's no apparently about it , leavers are racists . 
  this is on you and you alone . 
  ah yes . 
  one instance of a racist attack , and suddenly 17million people are bigots . 
  the attack did n't even mention the leave campaign . 
  are you having a laugh ? 
   that 's because you do n't understand the global economy at all , chap . 
  we 'll see what actually happens in three years time :\\ ^ ) stock trading is my job , so i 'd wager i 'm significantly more qualified than you to talk about this . 
  and the poll is n't cited . 
  why am i not surprised ? 
  done by the daily mail for all i know . 
  sure i did . 
  do you live in the uk , per chance ? 
  oh right , you do n't , and you get your opinions from biased media . 
  the remain campaign was the populist campaign . 
  leavers were racist apparently , and even the bbc was visibly shocked when the result came in on the day . 
  i voted leave , because i think the single market is a rubbish idea . 
  that is derived from my understanding of global economics , so please do n't label me things i 'm not .
