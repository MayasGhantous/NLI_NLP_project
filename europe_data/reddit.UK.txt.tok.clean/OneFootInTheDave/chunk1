you did a great job mate . 
  it 's just that everyone thinks their city has the potential to look better !, 
  thought it was a great album , thanks for putting it together . 
  same . 
  little known fact : when queen played in budapest , freddy mercury really wanted to buy the hungarian parliament building , but was refused . 
  or so our hungarian tour guide told us . 
  ca n't speak for other countries , but the uk one sounds like 90 % of the meetings i 'm in at work . 
  how about the united kingdom of europe ? 
  you can borrow our monarchy if you like . 
  i just like the name , honest . 
  no ulterior motive here ... ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ empire ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ rise ^ ^ ^ again !, 
  i thought maybe some of the audience had realised that they were booing a couple of 17 year old girls , and tried to drown out the booing with cheering . 
  is this basically the answer to the us and china doing far too well at the olympics ? 
  also , sad to see that it does n't look like there 'll be any velodrome cycling . 
  just bmx , mountain and road . 
  i was absolutely hooked during the olympics ( although that could be partly because team gb did so well ) . 
  i do n't know , i think that one 's pretty funny !, 
  [ edit ] oh god damn it we 're ukip ... 
  and the other 's in cyprus , yes . 
  well [ skylon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skylon_%28spacecraft%29 ) is being developed in the uk . 
  not a full eu project , but at least it 's * in * the eu ( for now ) . 
  still quite a way off though . 
  maybe it 's different in the uk , but i had quite a lot of experience with gypsies ( irish travellers ) when i was younger . 
  they moved in on our school field , completely tore it up pissing about doing donuts , and left a complete mess when they finally moved on . 
  the gypsie kids would spit at us and try and start fights whenever they went past , cheered on by their elders . 
  it was n't just the school field either , any free patch of grass in the town would end up with gypsies on it at some point . 
  never had any issues with romani gyspies though . 
  never met any , to be fair . 
  you forgot the final one that they went with in the end : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqhmsux_9e8, 
  i saw a lot of cyclists when i was in budapest last year . 
  all of them were on the pavement though . 
  bloody nightmare . 
  yep , barely see any bikes about when i 'm back up north . 
  there 's a few , but not even approaching the number you see in london . 
  in london he 's not wrong . 
  we complain a lot about the planned engineering works or strikes etc. , but it 's actually pretty amazing . 
  especially when compared to the rest of the country . 
  went back to manchester recently and the difference is staggering . 
  why are all these people jizzing on their screens ? 
  that 's got to void the warranty , surely . 
  bit of a misleading title . 
  he was asked by a greek reporter , in greece , whether the marbles should be returned and he basically said `` i guess that would be nice '' . 
  it 's not like he rocked up to 10 downing street and demanded that david `` call me dave '' cameron hand over the marbles . 
  also the fact that you 're terrible at queueing . 
  that 's the most common complaint i hear about the french over here . 
  expected to be cleaner than buses ? 
  unless they mean in an environmental sense then i doubt it . 
  nah , we only make fun of people we actually like . 
  ^ kidding, 
  # 150 for me in london . 
  i rent a 3 bed flat with 2 other people . 
  i do get my own bathroom though . 
  my friend in bradford on the other hand pays the same amount for a huge , beautiful flat all to herself . 
  only downside is that she has to live in bradford . 
  plus there does n't seem to be nearly as much rain down south . 
  i think the furthest south of the cities on that list is sheffield ( although my geography 's not great ) . 
  [ edit ] my bad . 
  apparently it 's stevenage . 
  also my geography is far worse than i thought . 
  virgin 's probably the most common one is n't it ? 
  not at all surprised we 're at the top though . 
  a return trip between london and manchester is # 77 ( and i believe a one way ticket costs nearly this much as well , for some bizarre reason ) . 
  what i do n't understand is that parental controls already exist . 
  if all the government really wanted was to protect children from seeing naughty images , they 'd educate parents , or even give them a free copy of some parental control software . 
  it would probably be cheaper , and that way the parents can decide what they want to block , instead of the government deciding for you . 
  another plus point for installing parental controls would be that parents could still access adult material , while denying it to their children . 
  having the isp block it means it 's blocked for everyone in the house , and so parents are much more likely to opt out of the government scheme , so they do n't have the restrictions imposed on themselves . 
  it really is a complete shambles . 
  if the law goes through in its current state then i would be very , very surprised . 
  at the very least i think they 'll have to make it an opt-in scheme instead of opt-out . 
  everyone else was always speaking it around me , even when i was very young , so i thought i 'd better try and pick it up . 
  you can but it 's still directionless and wo n't achieve anything . 
  much better to be * for * a cure , or * for * immunisation . 
  i think `` the tube '' refers specifically to the london subway , and `` underground '' would be a more general term ( e.g. 
  `` do you want to take a bus or the underground ? '' ) . 
  you can get away with calling a flat an apartment too , although i think flat is probably more common . 
  also a tv is still a tv , but telly 's more of a slang word for it . 
  all the usual drugs are illegal here , but cannabis laws are n't really enforced much . 
  we also have something called a `` cannabis warning '' , which is a verbal warning issued to people for a first time offence of posession of cannabis . 
  for a second offence i believe you get an on the spot fine . 
  in practice , the police do n't really seem to care . 
  a few years ago at uni there were about 8 of us packed into a room , all smoking and watching a movie ( pineapple express coincidentally ) . 
  we hear a loud bang on the door followed by the shout of `` are you smoking cannabis in there ?! '' . 
  we all shat bricks , naturally . 
  the police told us all to come out of the room , which we did , and then one of them said in a friendly tone `` we do n't care if you 're smoking a bit of weed , we just came round to tell you there 's been a lot of robberies in the area recently , so make sure you lock your doors '' . 
  we had a nice chat to them , they asked what we were watching , etc. 
  and then they left . 
  southern england could * maybe * be the lannisters , but definitely not the north . 
  the north is as close to northern england as you can get . 
  it 's made up of grassy hills and the weather 's awful . 
  also all of the inhabitants have northern english accents ( but i suppose that 's more down to the language of the show ) . 
  as maliciouslama said down the page , the lannisters are probably more like spanish or italian noble families . 
  especially when you see [ tywin in his armour ] ( http://i.lv3.hbo.com/custom-assets/enrichments/series/game-of-thrones/r3/images/houses2/people/detail/tywin-lannister.jpg ) . 
  also , we english end up being the bad guys a lot as well , you know !, 
  just look at star wars , the entire galactic empire was british !, 
  actually the stormlands , where robert baratheon is from , was france , which would make robert baratheon francois hollande . 
  berlusconi is definitely a better fit though . 
  well i see 10 % as the minimum , so if it 's been exceptional then i do n't think 15 % is too much . 
  # 3 on a # 20 meal is n't too bad . 
  taxis , waiters , delivery people and hairdressers .
