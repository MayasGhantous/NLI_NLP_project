  i genuinely do n't think i 've ever heard anyone refer to new year 's as january 1st here . 
  i believe i 've heard of davy crockett ( frontiersman , racoon skin hat , died at the alamo , right ? ), 
  and john henry ( the guy who raced against a drill or something to tunnel through rock i think ? ) . 
  have n't heard of the other two . 
  currently : dynasty warriors 8 : xtreme legends ( just finishing it off ) , witcher 3 , total war : warhammer , renowned explorers and europa universalis iv . 
  also just finished off getting all the single player achievements in gta v. looking forward to : nier automata , civ 6 ( for when it goes on sale way into the future ) , mount and blade ii : bannerlord and tyranny . 
  i 've only played civ 5 out of the civ games and i normally play japan , purely because bushido is such a good trait thing . 
  as for europa universalis , i 've only played eu4 and i normally choose scotland ( i 'm scottish ) , poland ( commonwealth was really fun and strong when i last played it ) or prussia ( who i normally play ( due to glorious space marines ) to try out new expansions if i have the time , also love playing within the hre in general ) . 
  dutch minor to netherlands with dutch republic is always something i find really fun too . 
  aye , i 've heard armchair general , backseat driver as well as armchair psychologist specifically for those people who try and diagnose people without any expertise . 
  i 'd generally say yes . 
  i think it might be partially tied into the positive politeness vs negative politeness thing . 
  i think saying it 's part of an ugly stereotype might be overstating it though . 
  it is certainly quite jarring when you run into it ( it is for me anyway ) but it 's usually pretty clear they 're just being friendly and have n't quite understood the cultural difference . 
  i 'd generally say it 's seen as something odd here rather than something bad . 
  might be from a bit of personal experience honestly . 
  i know when answering similar kinds of questions elsewhere i 've had americans ( or people claiming to be at least . 
  also worth noting they were obviously a minority of the americans involved in the discussion ) kind of jump down my throat and badger me to explain why i did n't mention the us . 
  if others have had similar experiences i can see why they might pre-emptively mention why the us is n't one of their choices . 
  as for the canada thing , it may be because canada is generally seen as more left wing politically and a bit less nuts than the us . 
  i do n't really have the background to say if it 's actually true but it feels like that 's how it 's generally percieved here at least . 
  i only mentioned it because i said my reasons for where i listed was because i only speak english fluently . 
  figured it 'd be a bit odd to not mention why the huge english speaking super power was missing from the list given that . 
  i was mainly trying to avoid some misunderstanding that i do n't like the us or something . 
  australia , new zealand or canada . 
  primarily because i only speak english fluently . 
  leaving the us off the list because i did n't particularly enjoy my time living there ( not saying it 's bad , just did n't really click with me ) . 
  i quite liked sam adams rebel ipa ( i think that 's what it was called anyway ) when i was in the states but i 'm not exactly a big beer guy myself . 
  please do n't be across the whole uk . 
  please do n't be across the whole uk . 
  sorry guys , just really hoping the scottish system is n't as fucked . 
  a bit late but i 'll just list a few of my favourites from scotland . 
  i really enjoy robert burns so some of my favourite poems from him are tam o'shanter , halloween and to a mouse . 
  for novels i 'd put trainspotting by irvine welsh ( you may have seen the film adaptation . 
  if you have n't , it 's worth a watch as well ) as i loved reading it and then the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde by robert louis stevenson partially due to how influential it 's been . 
  i 'll also cheat a little and say an english play about scotland as it 's my favourite play : macbeth . 
  just personal experience here , i 've only seen people annoyed by that one if the person saying it is also working under the impression britain = england . 
  that being said , i also tend to try and make it clear my preference is to be called scottish ( mainly because if i 'm introduced to someone as british they 're going to expect me to be english ) so maybe there 's some truth to it . 
  that serves me right for posting without sleep . 
  it 's probably more equivalent to the falklands i.e. 
  they count as british so their inclusion makes sense . 
  i 'm not an expert on french citizenship but would they not just count as french citizens ? 
   a / r/europe discussion is more likely to be about germany is that true that was the point , yes . 
  funnily enough , if it 's going to be more likely to be relevant to discussion in the sub it should be represented . 
  i 'm not going to go into a us specific sub with flags for each state and ask for a scottish flair . 
  it 'd be fucking asinine . 
   i would never suggest they need represent the likes of wyoming , but i do n't think that covers it enough for 20-something regions of france to be represented when california is n't . 
  well , may i give you a hint as to why those 20 something regions of france are represented , whereas neither california nor wyoming are ? 
  they 're in europe and hence included on / r/europe . 
  i would personally rather that no us states were included or anywhere outside of europe outside of their countries as opposed to picking and choosing which areas we deem ` important ' enough to warrant it 's own flair such as in your california and wyoming example . 
  i much prefer it as a simple question of `` is it in europe ? '' . 
  also , i think california would have a larger impact but mayotte would be more representative of a part of europe . 
  therefore , i 'd say mayotte has a significantly greater reason to be included . 
  i feel at that point you 're expecting a sub catering primarily to europeans and europe to make an exception for the us , as if the us gets that why not canada for each province as well ? 
  i also imagine it 's because what state someone is from in germany is more likely to be relevant to a discussion in / r/europe than what state someone is from in the us . 
  when i went to school ( in scotland to be clear , so scottish education system and it was a while ago ) i can only recall the us getting a minor mention in our wwii module that was specifically about hitler 's rise to power leading up to the war as well as an in-depth module about the civil rights movement in the us . 
  i do not remember anywhere else in the americas even being mentioned . 
  i 've had a conversation about it with my friends . 
  we universally decided it 'd be a bad idea because in the event that we ( scotland ) get independence then we 're going to need points from ireland for eurovision . 
  that should pretty much sum up how serious it is . 
  however , i have seen people brainstorming stuff based around things like the nordic council for a similar celtic equivalent somewhat based around an expansion of something similar to the british irish council . 
  there 's obviously not a major push for it or something as it involves scotland being independent but that is something similar i 've heard a few people mulling over basically . 
  going for neddy rather than chavvy 'cause i 'm scottish but i do n't think i 've even heard of people giving aussies any shit even from that demographic . 
  at least , no more than anyone else basically . 
  may want to x/post to askuk though, 
  scot here , from one of the better off areas and white though as a heads up on perspective . 
  just wanted to give an opinion on scotland and a heads up on the possible citizenship . 
  i 'd say we 're generally pretty accepting , though as i 'm relatively young ( early 20s ) i do n't know how new it is . 
  it 's certainly one of the key points being pushed in scotland 's new identity via civic nationalism though . 
  i genuinely think you 'd get more grief ( jokingly ) for being english . 
  i 'd probably say go for ireland if you 're choosing between the two though , as it 's going to have everything in order more than a newly independent scotland will . 
  main point was , that going by the white paper that the snp laid out prior to the last independence referendum you 're right about being eligible for scottish citizenship . 
  ( http://www.gov.scot/resource/0043/00439021.pdf bottom of page 16 has the summary for citizenship information . ), 
  apparently scotland varies more than this lays out . 
  studied an stem course here and just had the same system you described as england having . 
  i do n't think my parents tried to ever use a monster to scare me . 
  my dad used stuff like `` oh , we 'll sell you off to white slavers then '' to try for the same effect i guess . 
  thankfully it 's only something i 've experienced twice and they were both very minor things really . 
  first was some american guy who seemed to be personally offended that i was a british person studying in boston . 
  kept trying to call me redcoat and limey as actual pejoratives . 
  was n't entirely sure that he was n't just joking ( poorly ) until he started getting kind of physically aggressive . 
  i mainly thought this one was just fucking weird , to be honest . 
  second time was some drunk eejit ranting at me for being a `` fucking jock '' etc when i was in sheffield one night . 
  it was like one month after the independence referendum or thereabouts . 
  i was a bit worried that was going to end in him trying to start a fight until someone else basically shouted him down and he slinked off . 
  i do n't think they 're even right on that point . 
  the census for example splits it into white then subcategories within . 
  for example i 'm white-scottish for census results but there 's also white-english , white-irish , white-polish etc as options which makes no sense if we do n't narrow down ethnicity past race . 
  that we hate the english .

  my favourites are probably something like this : ** ps1 ** * spyro 2 : gateway to glimmer * crash 3 : warped * crash team racing ** ps2 ** * gladius * shinobido : way of the ninja * romance of the three kingdoms viii * shadow of rome * final fantasy x * burnout 3 : takedown * timesplitters 2 * star wars battlefront 2 ** pc ** * command & conquer : red alert 2 * lord of the rings : battle for middle-earth * warhammer 40k : dawn of war - dark crusade * the whole witcher series * fallout : new vegas * europa universalis iv ** ps3/xbox 360 ** * red dead redemption * armored core iv : for answer ** nintendo stuff ** * pokemon red & gold * fire emblem : radiant dawn sorry for the length but i 'm having trouble trimming it down further . 
  i was always told it was supposed to be a sign of good luck . 
  wikipedia seems to back up that it 's generally seen that way here in scotland . 
  rome total war : rome ( usually julii ) or the seleucids . 
  rome ii total war : rome medieval total war : byzantine empire medieval ii total war : scotland , hre or denmark . 
  enemy was milan !, 
  curse the traitorous backstabbers . 
  shogun total war : uesugi or tokugawa shogun ii total war : oda or takeda . 
  main enemy was usually the ikko ikki .
