  nope . 
  ukip is full of cunts . 
  and many more moroccans had nothing to do with it . 
  they were as horrified as you or i to see those crimes . 
  they did n't choose to be moroccan . 
  nationalism and patriotism are not the same thing . 
  you can love your country and not be a neo-nazi . 
  i 'm referring to the people throwing molotov cocktails at innocent people . 
  whatever some refugees may have done , nothing justifies the actions of these scumbags . 
  why not call them what they are ? 
  terrorists . 
  i really hope [ this ] ( http://www.trabant-nt.de/374/en/the-project/trabant-nt.aspx ) takes off . 
  think of how many lives have been saved by preventing him from going . 
  it would certainly not be better . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  my bad . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  porn and internet i understand but surely literature should be encouraged . 
  obviously not any book they like - mein kampf for example should definitely not be allowed . 
  [ relevant stewart lee bit .

  but apparently the people who stopped him are refugees . 
  that would mean that were it not for merkel , they might not be there . 
  because in most cases it is ok . 
  in most cases it is all the same . 
  that this is newsworthy suggests it is n't especially common . 
  and nowhere to wash your hands . 
  it is nationwide average . 
  if it split each nation into different regions it might give better results .

  he 's been buying pizza for gaming journalists in exchange for their ethics . 
  well the netherlands and france came close to electing nazis and a lot of young people voted for them . 
  it seems like the lessons have been forgotten . 
  they can still be imprisoned . 
  they can still be deported if the country they will be sent to will neither torture nor execute them . 
  there is a middle ground between torture/execution and release . 
  as a victim of a crime , you have the right to seek justice . 
  you do not have the right to have someone tortured or executed . 
  brown is n't a race , it 's a colour , so it 's not racist . 
   in the core of the holocaust was social darwinism . 
  groups of people were murdered based on ethnic , sexuality , etc. 
  reasons . 
   more than that . 
  the nazis committed their crimes with surgical precision . 
  the elements of modernity , industry , record keeping , mechanisation , were used to commit those atrocities . 
  that 's unique in human history . 
  what type of car were you in ? 
  the media and politicians would have you believe it was 90 % leave and 10 % remain . 
  at the risk of sounding like a smug arsehole , whatever happened to `` all lives matter ? '', 
  i mean it . 
  it 's sad that you would think that but i genuinely believe this . 
  i am opposed to torture and capital punishment and can not conceive of any scenario where it is acceptable . 
  i am proud of the echr because of this . 
  we are so opposed to torture and capital punishment that we have a law to prevent us from deporting the worst among us unless we can be guaranteed that they will be neither executed not tortured . 
  the poppy burners were arrested . 
  [ proof ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/12/arrested-poppy-burning-beware-tyranny-decency ), 
  if you count the scottish referendum , there has been a major vote in this country every year since 2014 . 
  no need to go so far back .

  out of curiosity , can a french speaker tell if someone is from kinshasa from their dialect ? 
  how noticeable is it ? 
  thanks . 
  so does that mean that it 's 75 % of those whose ages were called into question not 75 % of all refugees arriving in sweden ? 
  that was the case here in the uk . 
  two in three of those who had their ages questioned were found to have been lying , not two in three of all new arrivals . 
  they 're helping people and saving lives . 
  their reason for doing so is irrelevant if they save someone from dying . 
  it 's a form of bigotry that seems to be perfectly acceptable . 
  [ so 3500 last year is overblown ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39096833 ), 
  who can blame them . 
  how galling would it be to have just escaped war and finally find refuge only to have people who have never met you attack you and tell you to go back . 
  on a related note , is n't vlad the impaler a local hero for opposing the mongols ? 
  something something george soros, 
  charlie chaplin 's the great dictator was released in 1940 and showed persecution of jewish people including ghettos . 
  at that point the final solution would not begin for another year . 
  that jews were being persecuted was well known by that point . 
  the rhetoric from the nazis regarding the jews was no secret . 
  and there are some who speculate that [ churchill may have known ] ( https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/myths/churchill-knew-about-the-holocaust ) about the concentration camps well before they were liberated . 
  not to downplay the horrible way that the irish were treated under british rule . 
  but the british were not the only people the nazis made enemies with . 
  if that news reel was from 1940 , it would be before the blitz when only mainland europeans , including austrians , czechoslovakians , poles , and jews that the nazis had hurt , not the british . 
  the poles and jews did nothing to ireland . 
  i have n't denied that stalin committed great atrocities . 
  what i 'm saying is that , unlike the nazis , it was n't central to the ideology that millions of innocent people be declared enemies of the state and be slaughtered . 
  i 'd argue that the crimes committed by the nazis are central to the ideology and that the same can not be said for communism . 
  every ideology can inspire great atrocities but few require it . 
  given the choice between a banker or a nazi , i think it 's a no-brainer . 
  given that many extremist groups , both their and here , operate underground , what could go wrong . 
   banning muslim women from wearing the veil is n't `` racist '' . 
  making a law that deliberately targets a minority group is racist .
