  saving these lives will encourage even more people to make the crossings , which will mean even more people squeezed onto boats , which will mean even more people die in the long run . 
  tell that to the eu countries who have n't donated more than a swedish furniture company while britain provides 50 % of the eu 's fund for the fight against ebola .

  why is n't france deporting them actually , instead of asking england to do it ? 
  why would n't it be ? 
  there 's a backlog of immigrants at calais and since it 's usually difficult to send them back home it 's easier to just spaz up a road and let them go the england . 
   it just make easier for migrants to hop in the trucks : / the road was recently redesigned to be completely retarded so the lorry drivers have to go really slow so more immigrants hop into the back of their trucks which then makes it no longer france 's problem . 
   and when that did n't work i think it did work for a while .

  it happened once . 
  stop fear mongering . 
   hurray for multiculturalism ... 
  i love this line . 
  there are plenty of born and bred nutcases right here in england . 
  britain first are all from england , but i suppose they are all actually from helmand province or something , where else would they learn to be extremists ? 
  it 's not like it 's a very complicated issue with no easy blame or solution , that 'd be nuts .

  [ except it was n't an isis flag ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2cxkc3/jihadist_flag_flown_in_east_london/cjkds7a )  [ the flag in this story is not the isis flag . 
  ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/8/7/1407441886856/the-jihadi-flag-outside-t-001.jpg )  it translates to `` there is no god but allah '' . 
    [ this is the actual isis flag . 
  ] ( http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/06/12/opinion/rfdiraq/rfdiraq-sfspan.jpg )   it is a declaration of one of the 5 pillars of islam ; it can also be found on the flag of saudi arabia . 
  its an islamic symbol , not something which is exclusive to '' radical '' groups .
