  and the government treating public money like a second bank account is n't unimportant compared to anything . 
  [ the same stephen fry who said the expenses scandal was n't really that important . 
  what a joke . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8045869.stm ), 
  gm crops = literally khan noonien sing . 
  ban gm now !, 
  edit : and hopefully gm foods help people recognise obvious sarcasm . 
   but there are also clinical reasons why people are fat such as ? 
   we all take bad decisions all the time all the things you mentioned only have to happen once . 
  getting obese is hundreds of choices every single day . 
  fight me for it . 
  which do you think obesity is ? 
  churchill wanted to ride straight to moscow and finish hitlers job at the end of the war . 
  crazy . 
  ukip was a protest vote . 
  barely any if their `` voters '' care . 
  i mentioned quite clearly that there should be education about politics before they can vote . 
  letting sixteen year olds vote would be pointless unless they taught politics in schools . 
  now they would just protest vote a stupid party or do what there parents did . 
   not old enough to enjoy basic rights of citizenship such as ? 
  you can get married at sixteen ( with parental permission like joining the army at sixteen ) , move out of your house , get a job and pay taxes and you can drink alcohol from the age of five or so . 
  what `` basic rights '' are sixteen year olds not getting ? 
  ` child soldiers ' rofl they cant go into combat or get pissed until they are eighteen . 
  rather have no goverment than this lot !, 
  i bet it 's the gay immigrants that steal the roads ... 
  was that real russian ? 
  what did they say ? 
  he said `` tunneller '' . 
  that 's called the horseshoe theory . 
  that 's nice . 
  good luck trying to stop people getting over the land borders . 
  onky switzerland would do well . 
  finally , a way to get rid of london . 
  i see why ukip loves all this global warming stuff . 
  help me, 
  he `` should '' have `` added '' some `` scare '' quotes . 
  obviously all these journalists have been kidnapping themselves . 
  you ruined it when you strung up sadam and shot bin hidin , if you left them alive they could be the boogeynan for another decade at least . 
  amatuers ... 
  `` i 'm not racist i know a black guy '', 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  revolutionaries ? 
  criminals ? 
   `` targeted '' , not `` launched '' . 
  besides , you think putin will see a trident nuclear missile ** targeted ** at his lunch and say `` drat , foiled again '' or do you think he will say `` bring me the nuclear suitcase '' ? 
  you ca n't play bluff with nuclear missiles you moron . 
  excuse me if i ignore some random american who only says things about a different country because that 's what his country is like . 
   one targeted missile at moscow would solve that problem . 
  make it four to limit vulnerability in a second-strke scenario . 
  announce that any attack against your country immediately will lead to nuclear retaliation . 
  save tons of money on toys like tanks or aircraft . 
  total cost of ownership : neglible . 
  you 've been watching to much party propoganda . 
  weakness is not strength . 
  war is not peace . 
  besides , you think putin will see a trident nuclear.missile flying towards his lunch and say `` drat , foiled again '' or do you think he will say `` bring me the nuclear suitcase '' ? 
   the ukraine 's error was agreeing to the budapest memorandum . 
  it 's not `` the '' ukraine . 
  one of the deputy pm 's punched someone who egged him in the nineties . 
   when will the us/nato understand ? 
  around the time putin gets bored again and invades somewhere else and people wonder who will help them . 
  besides , would you look after kids if you had them ? 
  or would you constantly leave them with soneone else ( the nato big boys ) while you go do stuff ? 
   that seems crazy they really have to make sure it 's actually `` unsinkable '' . 
  on the upside the exchange rate is probably decent enough for you to get a beanie and some kids for just a few $ . 
  why is it just english and french and not more of the 230 languages ? 
   seems a bit hard for me . 
  why ca n't the french just learn english and speak english ? 
  because the world does n't revolve around you and your arrogance ? 
  they must be speaking english a lot then . 
   i , prefer to understand what people are saying learn french . 
  pretty sure that union jack is the wrong way round . 
  thank hitler for taking out those rn imposters !, 
   and i 'm not british but are you english ? 
  if poland was n't just trying to show off to his mates and laid down and took the invasion up the bum none of this mess would have happened . 
  ban sovereignty !, 
  the fact that they thought `` predator = prey ? 
  naaa let 's use another word ! '', 
  is a really very ... interesting ... ? 
   conquering deserts yeah , about that ... also , he was right , we did replace cannonballs and bombs ... with missiles . 
  it 's a bit more like alcoholics anonymous than a group of countries who happen to be neighbours . 
  '' * hi my name is germany and i 've not killed anyone is seventy years !, 
  the one who invades other lands , proclaims themselves king and kills all the people there is the nazi . 
  the one who invades other lands , proclaims everyone king and sends half the population to work and kills the other half is the soviet . 
  first off how dare you come between an englishman and his moan against any form of authority . 
  reported to mods . 
  seriously though , yeah i 'm an idiot , i did n't think of that . 
  i do remember a lot of people went super spastic about the amount of traffic last time but that 's the only real negative i can think of . 
  at least boris will make a killing off the congestion charge !, 
  i just hope all that olympic shit got packed away/burnt , i visited there in 2012 ( a week after the riots big up the met mandem ) and all the shit was so expensive the guy running the shops could pay off north korea 's debt while on a gold toilet . 
  ingurluund ingurluund ingurluuund first we find out we 've got the best uni 's ever now we get the olympics again . 
  wait no it was really expensive n ^ o ^ ^ o ^ ^ ^ o ^ ^ ^ ^, 
  and apparantly the british army would have used mustard gas if any germans actually landed in britain . 
  they would n't have got far that 's for sure . 
   liberator i thought they preferred `` great leader '' and a quick blowie behind a shop ? 
  actually they probably did n't know what a shop was ... 
   churchill took a hardline against hitler and essentially started world war ii over fascism . 
  chamberlain started the war . 
  blame the tories , it 's what the rest of us do . 
  that 's racist .
