  you must be confused , here in / r/europe the only religion that has extremists ( and remember , every single one of them is an extremist ) is islam . 
  i see they are starting with the hardest and going down to easy . 
  i look forward to hearing about five of these guys trying to attack someone in russia and then getting the shit kicked out of them . 
  oh no , poor wales !, 
  a sheep might get a bit confused !, 
  but no you 'll never have a way to accidentaly break plates you do n't like !, 
  haha !, 
  you do n't need to be powerfull to be happy , and thoughts like `` we 'd be really big and powerfull if we ... '' and `` if we all joined we 'd be amazing and then ... '' is how things like the british empire and world war ii started . 
  i always liked to think of denmark as germany 's penis . 
  probably because most people realised it was a lampost . 
  your post is the definition of generalisation and nothing else . 
  it was made there but it 's maiden voyage was from southamtpon . 
  since i ca n't think of any other achievements other than being bombed a lot by the germans i went with the titanic . 
  southampton , england : the titanic ... yeah ... oh and jane austen lived her for a few years i think . 
  it definately was a gift ... if you were a very powerfull brit ... 
  is n't that the one pronounced `` seemen '' ? 
  is it pronounced the same in germany or is it only funny in english ? 
  yeah , but baby !, 
  royal baby !, 
  who does n't love babies ?!, 
  look at this baby !, 
  it 's not even the royal baby , but who cares , babies !, 
  / signed , the british `` news '' . 
  so because it 's not good it 's not relevant ? 
  rightio . 
  and the article is about getting rid off the monarchy , and the video is about what they do for the country , it could n't really be * more * relevant . 
  i dunno , if you 're going to depose the monarchy you might as well do it in style . 
  figen * bum * is decoding the backdoor . 
  oh numb3rs you so kinky . 
  well , better * is * subjective . 
  some people like that sort of thing . 
  anything that is n't a slight variation of the same name would be an improvement . 
  the locals can get a bit bitey though . 
   just send it away to where it does n't bother people . 
  if there were no parking spaces then the only other place a car could be is on the road . 
  i like the dragon but we all know [ what the uk * really * looks like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lmggmqc.jpg ) . 
  the recipe told me to do it so i did it , i had no choice !, 
  have you seen the [ edl facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=505793702820630&amp;id=238696516197018 ) ? 
  they are urging people to `` take to the streets '' in what i 'm sure will be a civil and justified protest against todays violence . 
  the mod have n't confirmed it yet so he could be anything . 
  i think you might be a bit misguided . 
   big media tin hat detected . 
   there seems to be no police or anything did you read the bit where the both of them where shot by armed police ? 
  racism incoming in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  winston chruchill and atoms bombs are also a bit of a giveaway . 
  we will be nice this time , promise !, 
  let 's be honest , who * has n't * got a bit tipsy and woken up with a gun and a load of dead germans around them ? 
   also , it is not racist if it is ** 100 % true **  i saw ** most ** of them well done , you 're a racist . 
  right , and i suppose you can prove that absolutely all of these rioters are mulsims immagrants , right ? 
  because if you could n't then you 'd be a racist according to your own rule . 
  it would n't be / r/europe with out a load of racists . 
  massive sweeping racist generalisarions about muslims ? 
  holy shit i 'm in / r/worldnews . 
   you do n't shoot to kill unless the situation risks lives or firearms are involved . 
  you mean like a nutter waving a machete around ? 
   second , they should have seen that community 's response coming and be prepared for it . 
  imagine the people who lost their vehicles and livelihoods in those riots . 
  no one is paying for that loss . 
  the police are n't rioting , idiots looking for an excuse to cause trouble are . 
  what do you mean about paying for the loss exactly ? 
  should the police fork out the money to pay for the damage ? 
  i could not care less . 
  you 're lucky because only scottish people can grow beards think enough to protect them from the weather . 
  force him to resign ? 
  are you serious ? 
  this is probably the london riots all over again : loads of people with shit covering there faces so they ca n't be identified and an undermaned police force . 
  just because there have n't been arrests now does n't mean there wo n't be later , there 's no reason for people to lose there jobs . 
  when you see the population of the uk like that it 's hard to believe only about 10 % of it actually has stuff built on it . 
  the population difference between london/the south west and everywhere else is pretty surprising . 
  it 's interesting to see that most of it is orange/pink except the port cites and the capitals . 
   `` this was an old man with a knife facing a whole gang of specially trained armed police officers . 
  did they really have to kill him ? '', 
  a neighbour told the aftonbladet tabloid the day following the shooting . 
  why did n't the ** specially trained ** police use the specail training to kung fu/shoot the machette out of his hands ? 
  shooting a guy with a weapon is definitely police brutality !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  `` youth '' means `` young people '', 
  except both the uk * and * denmark * are * specail because they opted out of using the euro , and sweden are n't switching to the euro either . 
  someones jealous . 
  why should britain be forced to adopt the euro to stay in the eu ? 
  that 's not very democratic really . 
  and the pound is n't really `` something inbetween '' having our own currency or using the euro . 
  you think boris is posh ? 
  what has american healthcare got to do with the nhs ? 
  i 'm not sure if you noticed but they are quite different . 
   mi5 , the patronizing government police watchdog yeah damn mi5 for all the terrorism they 've prevented !, 
   the nhs , the hallowed , sacrosanct , flawless , best-in-class healthcare service that literally has no flaws whatsoever nhs is the `` best in class '' ? 
  no one in the history of the world has ever said that . 
  it 's not really a secret that the nhs has massive problems . 
   the civil service , the people 's checks and balances against the ( only duly elected if it 's labour ) dae hate tories ? 
   addressing concerns that european banking legislation is adversely affecting the city of london , the 19 business leaders say that the right answer is to fight for britain 's interests inside the eu -- rather than attempting to go it alone . 
  this is the answer here . 
  leaving the eu because there are problems ( just like any large organisation ever ) is the wrong answer , actually trying to change stuff and make it better for everybody is the right thing to do . 
  i really hope britain stays in the eu , we may just be a small island but we 've been in the big boys pool for a while now . 
  leaving the eu would ruin all that and make britain shite . 
   they also call for david cameron to `` strengthen and deepen '' lol, 
  yeah sure it does when you deliberately try to make them sound bad . 
  they could have just said `` gchq , a government intellegence agency '' since that 's what it is . 
   authorities at gchq , the government eavesdropping agency nice unbiased reporting from the gaurdian there . 
  does assange realise that he 's been given these on purpose and if no one wanted him to have them he would n't ?
