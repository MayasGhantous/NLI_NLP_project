it 's fairly obvious is n't it ? 
  the more people with access to guns the more likely it is one of them will attempt a mass shooting . 
  it 's not a coincidence that the [ four us states with the most mass shootings ] ( http://qz.com/463260/all-204-mass-shootings-so-far-this-year-in-america-mapped/ ) are also the four with the largest population . 
  if switzerland had a population of 60-80 million and the same gun ownership levels it would be surprising if the number of mass shootings did n't increase . 
  i agree , the point i was trying to make is that switzerland has so few mass shootings in part because of it 's small population . 
  they were in the school shootings wiki page not the rampage killers list . 
  they were the two school shootings i was talking about , using the fbi definition of more than four dead . 
   even in the usa they are stopped by the police . 
  they just shoot themselves when confronted , as they do in germany . 
  most of them commit suicide way before they 're confronted by the police and some just hand themselves over . 
  it 's pretty rare that a police officer directly stops a mass shooting . 
  it does n't look like the lists are incomplete , there 's more than two but only two have a death count of more than four . 
  you have to draw the line somewhere , it makes sense to use the fbi definition . 
   there is also no point excluding ` less ' successful killing sprees just because the police was able to stop the culprits fast enough , of which we had over a dozen , though it might tell you something about the efficency of the german police how many were stopped by the police ? 
  in the us it 's pretty rare that the police actually stop a mass shooting , normally the shooter commits suicide or just stops . 
  the fbi definition is four or more dead including the shooter . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_rampage_killers_ ( europe ) 0 in germany since 2000 . https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_shooting two school shootings in germany since 2000 . 
  switzerland had a mass shooting in 2001 and 2013 . 
  the only mass shooting in the uk since 2000 was in cumbria in 2010 , i could n't find any in france ( do terrorist attacks count ? ), 
  and just one in germany in 2009 . 
  switzerland has had 2 mass shootings since 2000 , that 's more than france , germany and the uk all of which have much larger populations . 
  it wo n't be the same as the pl but it will be a lot better than it used to be . 
  but the cost of living is also lower . 
  salaries in edinburgh and aberdeen are pretty similar to london from what i 've read . 
   many regions in the uk rank in the poorest ten regions in the whole eu ( places like rotherham and north wales ) that 's nonsense . 
  poland are a much better team than ireland . 
  it 's 2002 all over again , ireland get a result vs germany and netherlands fail to qualify . 
  to be fair that 's only because of the ruble to dollar exchange rate . 
  / r/eder there are eder memes because he 's crap , it 's hilarious that he scored the winner . 
  just looking at the figures there it seems likely that the median wage in ppp per hour is just as high , if not higher in the netherlands and germany than in the us . 
  and median ? 
  americans do work more hours than most european countries . 
  7 % more than in the uk . 
  21 % more than france . 
  25 % more than netherlands . 
  30 % more than in germany . 
  at one point it became [ `` fuck off england , we 're russia and wales '' . 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uhye1mci0ow ), 
  a sport very closely resembling football has been played in britain since the early 1800s , the first league season was 1889/1890 . 
  the first aussie rules league was set up in 1896 . 
  it 's a shame that so many years of belgium 's golden generation have been wasted with wilmots . 
  hodgson was shit but in a country the size of england we 're almost guaranteed to have good players coming through all the time , belgium probably wo n't . 
  first of many i hope !, 
  i do n't think any of them are older than association football . 
  sometimes you do http://www.groundhopping.se/res/juventus/juventusfc2.jpg, 
  they call it both , i think in dublin football is more common but in other towns soccer is . 
  france can lose to iceland , that 'll soften the blow a little . 
  this week could have gone better . 
  even then i do n't believe it , at what point are the richest italian 's better off ? 
  do you have to compare the richest 5 % to the bottom 5 % americans for them to be better off ? 
  if you 're in the top 10 % in italy you 're probably earning at the minimum $ 60,000 or $ 70,000 , the poorest 10 % of americans probably make less than $ 15,000 . 
  it also says ` quality of life ' so crime , obesity , drug and alcohol abuse should all be taken into account , there 's just no way it can be true . 
  the poorest 10 % of americans are better off than the richest 10 % of italians ? 
  that sounds absurd . 
  no , only those who are 17 and under wo n't have their names revealed . 
  singapore and hong kong are richer and both were colonised . 
  the format helped a lot , one team from each country and only four two legged ties before the final , if you were a half decent team and got a lucky draw getting to the semis was a lot easier back then , though the majority of the time it was still a dutch , spanish , english , italian or west german winner . 
  from 1956-1992 only on six occasions did a team from outside those countries win it and three of them were in the first decade . 
  like you said money has definitely made the champions league less competitive now . 
  it 's sad that great teams like porto , benfica , celtic , psv and ajax do n't stand a chance anymore . 
  the perpetrator could then eat the evidence , it 's the perfect crime . 
  i 'm a little sceptical , this is a country where a [ man getting hit with a biscuit was recorded as a violent crime . 
  ] ( http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/crime/man_hit_with_biscuit_recorded_as_a_violent_crime_by_norfolk_police_1_4121051 )  while 6 per cent said they were attacked with a potentially lethal weapon such as a bottle or gun at least once a month . 
  there are 127,000 full time police officers in the uk , 6 % would be 7,620 or 91,000 per year . 
  it 's very rare that a police office will be murdered in the uk , maybe one or two a year , some years none . 
  i do n't understand how there could be some many attacks with ` potentially lethal weapons ' but almost zero deaths . 
  i agree , we should n't rule out the nazis either . 
  it 's incorrect . 
  uk is 1 per 100,000 . 
  germany , netherlands , spain and a few other countries are all like 0.8 , 0.9 . 
   in comparison in germany the suicide rate is 18,9 and in hungary it 's 40 per 100.000 that 's just for males right ? 
  i doubt the overall suicide rate is that high , in the uk it 's around 10 per 100,000 . 
  facts are salty are they ? 
  what ? 
  ireland 's real gdp is smaller than their reported one . 
  their economy grew at 26 % last year but only 6 % was considered ` real ' growth . 
  the $ 73,000 figure above is not accurate . 
  they look like red pacman more than hearts . 
  they do affect gdp figures , it 's why there 's a big gap in ireland 's gdp and gnp . 
  also why ireland 's gdp grew at something ridiculous last year like 26 % . 
  i 'd be surprised if cork 's actual gdp per capita was $ 62,000 . 
  are n't irish gdp figures misleading because a few dozen american mnc 's there for tax purposes . 
  source ? 
  i doubt that . 
  there 's around 650 murders every year in the uk , `` more than 100 '' would mean that about one in every six murders is an honour killing . 
  edit : [ a total of 18 from 2010-2014 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33516885 ) in the uk . 
  not even close to 100 per year . 
  haha wtf, 
  that seems like a lot . 
   no , i do n't need to do that . 
  the original statement as it was made was incorrect and derogatory towards modern eastern european countries ; my example shows this . 
  i used that example because it was the first one i had to hand . 
  and it 's good enough to make the point . 
  using an example from 20 years before the eu existed is dumb and does nothing to disprove his point . 
  had it been germany instead of the uk would you have cherry picked 1946 ? 
   you do n't sound like a very nice person . 
  i made a small change but it 's copied and pasted from one of your previous replies . 
  why did you mention the 70s then ? 
  the claim was the uk had a better standard of living before the eu existed . 
  should n't you have compared how the uk was in the late 80s and early 90s to eastern europe now then ?
