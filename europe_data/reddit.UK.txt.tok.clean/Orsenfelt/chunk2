  what if this was nothing to do with independence and the government said '' * yeah you could vote labour in the next general election but if we happen to win it we 'll never listen to a registered lefty every again * '' . 
  particularly shitty kind of democratic freedom they are promoting do n't you think ? 
   imagine if the english were having a vote on independence and were saying that they did not want to be in a country with scotland , but that the oil should continue to be a joint asset and be owned joinly by england and scotland after independence ? 
  how would that go down in scotland ? 
  the united kingdom did n't * make the oil * though , it made the infrastructure around it and it should absolutely get its fair share of that infrastructure . 
  all ` union ' stuff should be split . 
  forget the potential political and economic problems certain assets being split might cause , can we agree that everything created ( good or bad ) as a union should be split if the union splits ? 
  if you take the marriage analogy , you would n't say that a husband could just flatly refuse the house ( or the car or whatever ) to the wife simply because she initiated divorce proceedings . 
  wanting out of the marriage does not require abandonment of all shared assets . 
  so if we agree on that ( which i think we do because you do think we should get our share of the debt ) then it 's logically consistent that we get our share of the bank of england . 
  * then * comes the discussion about how we actually realistically do that without harming either country . 
  i 'm entirely open to the idea it ca n't be done well , i believe osborne when he says it should not be done and that ruk will oppose it at every turn ** but ** saying he wo n't even discuss and that the decision is final betrays the idea that this is in any way a diplomatic process for the good of the people and it denies our ` property rights ' . 
  he 's essentially dismissing our part ownership of it out of hand which is a very extreme position to take against a segment of your own population who will still live in the country you run if the vote goes no . 
  that 's all this is , saying a currency union is a bad idea and they do n't want to do it is n't an issue . 
  saying they 've already decided , wo n't discuss it and we just have to live with their choice is the problem . . that 's not a way a government should act towards its population . 
   yes , the uk can confirm that it will not enter into a currency union i think this is the disconnect , you ca n't * not join * something you are already in . 
  or more accurately you ca n't opt someone else out of something . 
  salmond 's position is that scotland owns part of the bank of england on the very same basis that it owns part of the national debt , independent scotland would n't be a shiny brand new entity and would n't have to be gifted that percentage back for a currency union to take place . 
  instead it would take it 's ownership with it and the new status quo 's specifics would be negotiated , scotland would have to be negotiated * out * . 
  i also think there is a * lot * of slightly differing culture at play in these threads with this . 
  scots have grew up being told they are an integral part , co-owners , of the concept of britain and i do n't get that feeling from other people , instead we seem to be viewed more as lodgers . 
  osborne 's announcement implies he 's decided that 's the case , that he can just refuse us access to something that we think partially belongs to us . 
  whether it is or is n't true legally is beside the point , salmond is probably right in that displaying that attitude will backfire on him in regards to a shift in polls . 
  nobody ever said it was just our decision . 
  it was the stated goal of the snp but osborne & co have * just decided * they wo n't talk about it . 
  it 's not just their decision either . 
  is n't influence over pound sterling an asset ? 
  it 's not physical and it ca n't be shared without massively complicating a hell of a lot of things but it 's still a shared asset and decisions over what happens to it should be reached jointly , not dictated by one side . 
  nuclear submarines are a shared asset and we do n't want them but we are n't just going to throw them across the border sept 19th and shout * `` your problem now '' * , we 'll negotiate on a way to deal with it that suits both parties . 
   sharing a monetary policy is essentially asking the ruk to continue to underwrite the economy of a foreign state they have no control over . 
  they would have control over it . 
  people like to pass around the * `` cake and eat it '' * stuff but the reality is that the snp/yes campaign have never said they want an independent scotland to immediately make decisions in a vacuum . 
  they 've repeatedly acknowledged that it will take decades to become truly independent and that we will still have to have just as much ( if not more ) political negotiations with ruk as the process goes on . 
  it 's always been sold as a give and take , to get our independence we need to play ball and find the a deal that everyone is happy with . 
  the no campaign from day one has been about fear , about how in september all ties will be cut and the lights will go out because kilted blue-face warrior salmond refused to let british gas in the country or something . 
  it 's never reflected reality , salmond does indeed speak in pie-in-sky ideaology but he 's not an idiot , he knows this is n't going to be won ( either way ) by attacking the other side because there is too much at stake , too many weaved lives , too many personal issues involved . 
  saying we wo n't take the debt might be a misstep , i do n't know but i also do n't think it 's like lashing out at daddy when he does n't buy you sweets . 
  he understands scottish politics a hell of a lot more than the tories do and he knows the populace does n't react well to * `` wo n't '' * . 
  if there is anything in this world scots love it 's a good deal and you do n't get a good deal if you do n't haggle , salmond is highlighting the times osborne decides he wo n't haggle . 
  last poll was 45 % yes / 55 % no ( roughly ) if you go by this graph ; http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72553000/gif/_72553658_graphic_624x180.gif, 
  you 've gotten this backward , this is a * response * . 
  salmond did n't just come out of the blue and say '' * hey fuckwads , we 're not taking debt * '' . 
  the plan has always been to take the debt , on the understanding that it would be an amicable split and fair sharing of assets ( probably done by population split ) . 
  osborne turned it bitter , osborne decided there wo n't be any amicable negotiations so salmond is exploring the full ramifications of that , scotland walks away and does n't discuss debt with ruk . 
  would he * actually * do it ? 
  probably not but he has to do something to remind osborne that there are things he might want from iscotland and it 's going to be harder to get them if he is n't playing nice . 
   the pound is a british currency , its not scottish , its not welsh , its not english . 
  its british . 
  an independent scotland will not be part of britain , and it will leave all of the british political institutions including the british currency . 
  fine , then britain keeps the debt . 
  it does n't * have * to play like that , the campaigns until now have promoted and preferred the alternative but if osborne wants to take his ball and go home that 's fine , salmond is merely reminding him that his choices have consequences too . 
   international relations has always been about realism and not about what is fair and unfair so when the uk government begins to present analysis based on yes vote it is somewhat naive to expect what seems to be a wish for sentimental fairness . 
  i do n't disagree , i 'm not about to cry that they are being `` meanies '' or anything stupid like that , simply pointing out that salmond is n't taking this position because he 's a tight fisted crybaby but instead he 's reacting to a change in tactics by the no campaign . 
  when they were all flowers and chocolate so was he , now they 've taken a hard line on something so has he . 
  simply showing that scottish independence is n't a completely one way street with only scottish interests on the line like they are trying to sell . 
   like it or not the # # # is part of britain and in the event of a yes vote , scotland will no longer be a part of britain . 
  so please vote no !!!, 
  the no campaign frequently conflicts with this viewpoint . 
  it bends over backwards to tell us that ` britain ' is the union of 4 , that we 're equal partners , do n't leave because you 'll break up the union , destroy the thing we built together ... etc etc etc. 
  * yet * when push comes to shove and an actual issue comes up suddenly britain , as a concept , has absolutely nothing to do with the scots and it 'll just revert in full to england and carry on . 
  scotland ? 
  oh they just left no biggie . 
  it 's a union in name only , the political class as well as quite a large portion of the country do n't actually think we have any claim to * any * of it but they 'll still get up and make speeches to the contrary to secure a vote and keep the union together . 
  it 's like . . say you and i baked a cake together . 
  you put in ~ 8 % of the effort/ingredients/etc and i kept telling you that your effort was appreciated and that it would n't be the same cake if you were n't there . 
  then when it was done and you wanted to take a slice home i said '' * no , this is my cake * '' . 
  8 % of the cake of britain is ours , so we keep being told , that means you do n't get to just decide what happens to our slice of it for us . 
  you ca n't just say * `` nah i do n't want the cake cut , does n't work for me '' * then shut the door in my face . 
  salmond is saying if you want to act like that then we 're not going to give you the money we owe for the ingredients . 
  there are consequences to not playing salmond 's nicey-nicey game , it 's not all just about what the uk ` grants ' to scotland . 
  like i said , a currency union might not work . 
  that 's fine but we should discuss it , find out what will work . 
  do n't just swan up like you own the place and lay down the law . 
  honestly i think salmond , whilst being a little petty , has a point . 
  we 've been told by this tory government time and time again that we should n't leave because this union is like a marriage and how we built everything we have together . 
  that we all have part ownership of all things british . 
  the yes campaign acknowledged that and accepted part ownership of the debt . 
  we built it together , we 'll take our fair share it 's only right . 
  it was * assumed * that would be true of everything , we do n't need to carve it up and change ownership but we are n't ** abandoning ** things we own 8 % of , it 's a divorce . 
  there should be discussions and an honest attempt at deciding the best way for that 8 % to be made available . 
  there seems to be a general opinion that these types of things are owned by ` the british ' and that the ` the british ' are graciously allowing scots to use it . 
  which is a bit patronising given the above , the marriage and togetherness crap they spouted at the start of every speech . 
  i thought we were british ? 
  i guess i was wrong . 
  should these ` british ' things automatically revert to full english/welsh/ni control after independence ? 
  we keep being told we built those things together * but * then told not to touch them because they do n't belong to us when we 're thinking about leaving . 
  pound sterling ( it 's reputation as well as influence over it ) is an asset built by the union , just like our roads or foreign embassies are . 
  nothing can be done about our split of the roads , it 'd be nice to come to an arrangement on the embassies . . so why ca n't we discuss what happens to our 8 % influence over pound sterling ? 
  even if it turns out it wo n't work why take the harsh stance and flat out say it wo n't happen now , months before the vote ? 
  so salmond 's position is if you wo n't allow us our 8 % control , wo n't even talk about it . . then we wo n't discuss our 8 % of the debt . 
  there are two sides to this , there are things ruk could negotiate and just closing down/rejected completely is n't going to help either side . 
  so if you want it all , take it . . including all the shite . 
  ------ not taking the debt is a terrible idea and nobody thinks a currency union would be easy but coming out and saying * `` no it 'll never happen , it 's ours and you can fuck off '' * is n't in the spirit of the edinburgh agreement and does n't show any respect at-all for the role of scots in this union . 
  it 's such a sudden an extreme position , contrary to everything the no campaign has said up to this point that salmond is ridiculing it by taking his own . 
  salmond is just trying to play hardball , trying to counter the deafening cries of '' * ca n't have it both ways * '' from the no campaign by showing that ruk also ca n't have it both ways . 
  of course it is in a way hypocritical ( he 's claiming 100 % ownership of the oil ) but he 's not the one out there every day trying to pal it up with scots and claim we 're all equal then kicking us out with nothing when we think about leaving . 
  either everything britain does is done by all 4 nations * or * britain is just england with tag-alongs . 
  culturally the latter has been true for a very long time , it 's now clear that the current government thinks it 's the case politically too ( whilst also trying to get you to believe the former so you 'll vote no ), 
  the swiss , so well versed in watch making they pay their bills with * time * . 
  i used nazi 's because it 's the go-to evil in these scenarios .
