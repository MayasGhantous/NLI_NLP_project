  just like if you 'd had said '' * pol pot used cctv * '' i 'd have said '' * hitler did it is n't a reason '' * . 
  i could have worded it better . 
   we should not be handing over so many various powers that can be open to abuse in the future but that 's not very good reasoning . 
  * all * powers could be abused but that should n't automatically shut down any discussion of giving power to someone . 
  the rest i brought up because this is a thread about the filters ? 
  you 're trying to tell me the british public is apathetic about ` evils ' like cctv and the filters and my point is that the reasons you have for thinking they are evils are flawed or irrational . 
  i 'm not downvoting you and whoever is should read the about reddiquette . 
   given german experiences with the stasi . 
  this implies that part of the reason those germans do n't like cctv is because it 's a bit like something the stasi did . 
  ie * `` it 's wrong because the nazi 's did similar '' * . 
  as for the comment you linked to , literally he first line is * `` i live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship . 
  '' * so your point kind of falls flat right away . 
  the uk is n't a dictatorship and does n't actually show any signs of becoming one . 
  i * agree * that it 's a bad idea but the hyperbole surrounding the issue really is n't helping . 
  all we have to go on is what is ** actually ** happening in the country . 
  what other countries do with similar systems is irrelevant and what * might * happen is also irrelevant . 
  for now it is * optional * and it 's not being used to round up ` deviants ' to be shot . 
  absolutely those things could change but we ca n't live our lives judging everything by doomsday scenario 's . 
  the government * might * round up everyone with type a blood and have their legs cut off but you are n't going to seriously use that as an argument against the nhs . 
  i did it support for several years , i know that parents do n't know how to/don ' t want to setup home-level filters so i buy the argument that we should encourage isp 's to offer a solution . 
  i also believe that we should n't need filters , that we should teach our kids to be level headed and know that it 's a big world out there and they might sometimes see things they do n't like and thats * ok * . 
  i also think it 's bad that children in delicate situations might be stopped form accessing useful information . 
  ** however ** , we are n't getting to talk about any of those things sensibly because as far as i can tell the whole debate is drowned out by two lunatic sides . 
  you 've got the '' * stop the kiddie rapists * '' - ignorati on one side and the * `` government wants to chip my brain * '' - conspirati on the other . 
  i 'd say with your flag that 's the pot calling the kettle black but i know ya 'll can get a bit touchy about that sort of phrasing . 
  that 's different though . 
  cctv cameras are in public places , where you have no privacy . 
  * i * could attach myself to a pole and film people walking by if i wanted to so there is no reason the government should n't be able to do that . 
  secondly , germans might be just a * little * bias in these matters because of the extreme situations in their history . 
  thirdly , '' * the nazi 's did it * '' is n't a reasonable argument for * or * against anything . 
   most people what definition are you using here ? 
  * ` majority of the population and i have facts to back up my claims ' * ' ** most people ** ' or just * ` the editor of the paper i read and the 3 other racist twats i listen to all say . . ' * ' ** most people ** ' ? 
  i think it 's important we clarify . 
   / u/stephen1986uk is an extreme left-wing/multiculturalist troll firstly , you 're using * multiculturalist * as some kind of insult ? 
  seriously ? 
  secondly , i 'm pretty sure stephen1986uk did n't write the article . 
  you got a problem , pal ? 
  you sound like a * sectarian-slur-here * !, 
   it 's interesting that denmark 's concerns are spread so evenly compared with other countries - this would seem either to suggest that danes do n't consider there to be much to worry about in their country at the moment or that everything is going to pot . 
  alternatively , danes might have a more equal understanding of the issues at hand whereas other countries are sensationalised towards certain things . 
  for example is there legitimate reason that we 're as worried about terrorism as the greeks or does our media/politicians just focus on it more than other countries . 
   im not racist but uh huh . 
  a scotsman once dropped a pound coin , as he bent down to pick it up it hit him in the back of the head . 
  nor did he ever . 
  a majority of people voted for someone else . 
   however , there was ( and i think still is ? ), 
  an opt-out system where homeowners , landlords etc. 
  could apply to have their property blurred out . 
  would n't you have to tell google your address to have that happen , probably providing your name in the process ? 
  is n't the whole point of the paranoia to make it harder to link you , your address and the image of your home ? 
  it ca n't be easy to reliably provide for millions of people . 
  supply of electricity ( or water ) has an easily definable target . 
  once it is provided , reliable and clean there is n't much to improve on ( for the end user ) . 
  that is n't the case for food . 
  while there is a certain minimum you need to keep a person alive , it can come in hundreds of forms , with different tastes/allergies etc to take into consideration . 
  it 's easier to allow companies to provide the food and instead just give people the money they need to buy it . 
  i think they mean that anyone can identify as british but when it comes to stronger patriotic style ideas you 're more likely to identify with england/scotland/wales than you are british . 
  it 's a smaller group to have more in common with . 
  example , i * know * i 'm british and obviously i know scotland is in britain . . but i * feel * scottish . 
  i identify with scottish symbology on a more base level than i do british symbology . 
  flower of scotland gives me chills , god save the queen does n't . 
   the snp does n't want one unless ridiculous conditions are attached . 
  to clarify for those who do n't pay attention to scottish politics . 
  the snp would want a double-majority , a majority of nations of the uk would have to vote to leave for it to happen not just a majority of the total population . 
  in theory could cause the 50m exit-wanting english to be kept in the eu by 5m scots ( or 3m welsh ) i support the snp and i can see where they are coming from ( there does need to be a * lot * more discussion about just how equal this supposed family of nations of ours is ) but this position needs a shit load of refinement before they seriously propose it . 
  it ca n't * just * be ` double-majority lol ! ', 
  it needs to be heavily grounded in some constitutional/federalism discussion . 
  the snp do n't want to be part of future ( uk ) government , they want to be large enough that they 're relied upon by the ruling party to get stuff through parliament which will allow them to extract further devolution as payment . 
  if they play their cards right they 'll put scotland in a position where it does n't really matter who is in westminster because it will be largely autonomous . 
  there 's * some * fear that the snp will push for uneven benefits for scotland , transfers of wealth etc but i think it 's unlikely . 
  they 've been around for 70 years trying to get scottish independence , if they screw it all up now by going for shiny trinkets instead of power devolved they 'll ruin their reputation . 
  spy on another country when they 're listening to their copies . 
  the bit you are missing is the holyrood 2016 elections . 
  * if * the snp , elected to government in 2011 , held that referendum and then ** within the same term ** just tried to get another - of course that would be absurd . 
  they are n't though . 
  there 's an election next year and the snp are saying their manifesto for that election will leave the possibility open should certain large things in the uk change - like an eu exit scotland did n't vote for . 
  if scottish people really did n't want that possibility we could just not vote snp next year , their manifesto becomes irrelevant , the triggers do n't matter and indyref # 2 is dead in the water . 
  current polls suggest 60 % of the vote though for snp , a ~ 15 % increase on 2011 . 
  polling also shows support for independence increasing and even large numbers of no voters wanting another referendum within 10 years . 
  so clearly the scottish electorate is n't * that * bothered by the prospect . 
  the level of anger and fragility of union support can not be under estimated . 
  do you really think 100 % of them will pass straight through ? 
  in which case spreading the refugees out across multiple countries is a more stable solution than placing 100 % of the burden on the member states who happen to be on the edge of the union nearest to the conflict . 
  deliberately . 
  it does n't matter what the answer is because it wo n't be good enough , you 've made up your mind already . 
  just like like you immediately downgraded a conflict you previously did n't even know about . 
  how many does it take before you endorse a persons decision to leave the area ? 
  easy to do , it has only been going for 36 years . 
  anyway not like turkey are fighting kurds like this guy right !? 
  you 're missing the point , you 're trying to rationalise the decisions made by people in a situation you more than likely ca n't even begin to comprehend . 
  he made the decisions he did . 
  hundreds of thousands have done the same . 
  continue believing you 'd live his life better if you like . 
  here 's the choice i see , either ; the guy 's a greedy amoral cunt who killed his kids because he 's too stupid to do the sensible thing and go alone . 
  * or * people like us sitting on the internet in our pants stop pretending we have even the slightest clue what his life is like . 
  -- here is the test i think should apply . 
  the last time you saw military hardware in person , maybe a fighter jet flying over or a big destroyer on the horizon ... were you terrified ? 
  have you * ever * been scared seeing military hardware ? 
  if the answer is no just take a minute to think how incredibly lucky you are and how that might effect the way you think . 
  to sleep in a un tent with 2 million other people , living on red cross rice , waiting years for the day they can go back home to their semi-detached pile of rubble where family/friends/neighbours had fuck knows what done to them ?
