  people that will risk their life in some rusty shit bucket to get to europe and just start a new life without all that are surely showing levels of ambition the ` benefit scroungers ' born here are n't ? 
   they do n't have one . 
  they 're incredibly impartial . 
  i would n't go * that * far . 
  they can be a little too trusting of authority and sometimes allow the tabloids to decide what ' * the nation is asking * ' . 
  much better than most but blind spots exist , i think . 
  they 're free to leave if they wish . 
  meh , we 're used to it . 
  on the positive side it lets us pretend we had nothing to do with all that nasty empire stuff . 
  you did n't think we 'd actually let you in did we ? 
  i mean . . * you * ? 
  i would n't if i were you , our dirty wee secret is we fucking loved all that imperialism stuff . 
  all english are british , not all british are english . 
  * technically * not all citizens of the uk are british but lets not get into that mess . 
  only a full nationwide list pr system * would n't * be biased to regional parties and although many support moving to * a * pr system i doubt the kind that gets rid of local mps would get much support . 
  the only people he has to pander to now are his right wing back benchers . 
   well he is n't wrong , as pointed out several times last night giving scotland full fiscal autonomy would result in an instant # 7.9 billion deficit for the scottish government if you snapped your fingers and gave scotland ffa tomorrow morning that would be true . 
  that 's why as the polling moved to showing the snp picking up lots of seats they switched to campaigning for smith to be ' * strengthened and expanded * ' and starting saying ' * full fiscal responsibility * ' instead . 
  the snp will argue that smith 's no detriment clause means any and all powers being moved to scotland have to be done in a way that does n't damage it , for example * if * giving control over corporation tax would cause a loss in funding then barnett should remain until such time there is no loss . 
  whether they get that or not who knows but it seems unlikely that the tories will go for the harsh approach given the result and how fragile the union appears to be right now . 
  moving that way , * long * time off though . 
  turn the uk into a mini europe . 
  all home nations have equal powers , westminster only deals with truly uk-wide stuff like foreign affairs , military etc. 
  the northeast was asked and turned it down . 
  west lothian is mostly a philosophical problem rather than actual practical one . 
  [ 0.42 % ] ( https://www.mysociety.org/2014/09/10/parliament-without-scottish-mps-how-would-it-have-looked-different-since-1997/ ) is the number of westminster votes , in devolved areas and since devolution , that would have gone differently if scottish mps were n't there . 
  this idea that scottish mps lord it over english laws is nonsense . 
  that is n't to say it should n't be fixed * but * we should consider if the effects of any fix would lead us to an even less democratic parliament . 
  the tory proposal for evel has two glaring flaws . 
  first just because something * ` is devolved ' * does n't mean it has no effect on scotland . 
  policy is devolved but through barnett the funding for scotland is still directly tied to what england does . 
  the second is that no scottish mp would ever realistically hold certain cabinet positions again , including pm . 
  would a party or the country * really * elect someone as leader who has never ( and is never allowed to ) vote on education/nhs/policing / etc in westminster ? 
  -- the only ** real ** solution is a full and equal federal setup . 
  not since the fixed term parliament act , no . 
  how dare we rely on the broad shoulders of this historic family of nations , eh ? 
  your initial statement was * `` england has no voice for england '' * . 
  perhaps you should vote for devolution like the rest of us . 
  https://www.mysociety.org/2014/09/10/parliament-without-scottish-mps-how-would-it-have-looked-different-since-1997/ ** the headline finding is that only 21 votes ( out of nearly 5000 since 1997 ) would have gone differently if scottish mp 's votes had n't been counted . 
   england has no representation , the english have no voice for england you mean other than the 550 + of 650 seats in westminster ? 
  from the very same article ;  60 % of scots thought the scottish government was best placed to make decisions about immigration policy in scotland even if they did not agree with its policies the snp are the only party offering , or likely to offer , realistic further devolution . 
  both , technically . 
  the current half-way house devolution in the uk means both ends can blame the other and neither does anything . 
  not all unions are equal and even if they were , why belong to two ? 
  i want more regional interference , a global political union and * higher * taxes . 
  westminster is almost identical in culture but it does n't want any of those things so what are my options ? 
  in the uk the hospital and the public insurance are the same thing , 99.9 % of the time . 
   even if it 's against the will of the people ? 
  just because the people elected the snp , does n't mean they want independence . 
  it is n't against the will of the people though , as evidenced by the fact that you literally just said the people elected the snp . 
  yeh but he 's one of them pesky experts innit . 
   ni is n't going anywhere mate . 
  stop being so mad that you and your cousins wo n't be able to come here and beg next summer . 
  really ? 
   so , it is confusing . 
  is british nationalism equal to english nationalism ? 
  there 's huge overlap , yes . 
   in my own class of about 40 , there was only one brit , who was a romanian immigrant and ** the only eurosceptic in the group ** . 
  i think we 've found their reasoning . 
  nobody would believe them though . 
  it 's been made quite clear - by constitutional experts currently in scottish parliamentary seats no less - that witholding consent in scotland would n't have any bearing on the overall brexit . 
  it 'd just be annoying . 
   she must show that being shackled to england means we get ignored precisely . 
  not * just * ignored either but completely hobbled in our efforts to not be ignored . 
  repeatedly . 
  all this attention just now in a weird way * kind * of has to be for nothing . 
  she 's got to fail spectacularly and by god if there is any nation on the face of the earth that can do that it 's us . 
  yet somehow threatening the self determination of her majesty 's own citizens does n't ? 
  on yer bike ya dafty the grown ups are talking . 
  it 's our oil , we 'll throw it where we like . 
  not like anyone is buying it . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ had ^ ^ to . 
  i 'm assuming the public stance will change after the article 50 triggering . 
  as far as i know that 's the point of no return . 
  the two years can get extensions but you ca n't get 1 year in and say * `` eeeeh nah we 'll stay '' *, 
  it 's a * really * weird position to take for the scottish tories . 
  ruth davidson ( for a stronger ruth party ) spent the last 6 months arguing that only she can oppose , that scotland deserves an active unionist party because scottish labour suck and the tories in the previous parliament were too small in number to claim a mandate so mostly just looked angry whilst abstaining ( fair position ) now she gets her mandate , second biggest party , expected to be that active unionist party - so she submits an amendment to curtail the voice of the scottish parliament then continues abstaining on the main motion anyway ? 
  they could have saved us all the bother by just popping a head around a door and reminding us what a shower of useless wasters they are . 
  see the latest episode ? 
  the eu told the uk to come the fuck in or fuck the fuck off . 
  up until article 50 as triggered , that 's the point which it all rotates and the uk moves from being a member state ( '' * who 's constitutional arrangement ca n't be speculated about * '' - as the boilerplate line goes ) to a being on the train out the bus out of town on a timetable . 
  from then on if any eu discussion about scotland - up to and including a fairly cast iron offer - is conditional on a bilateral secession referendum then spain has nothing to worry about . 
   they 've already committed to another referendum bzzzt , nope . 
  sturgeon 's motion in parliament today ( which passed ) explicitly states her actions - ie the visits , the expert panel etc - are not a direct approval for an independence referendum but ** only ** to explore any possible way of maintaining scottish membership of the eu . 
  if it becomes the case that can only be done as an independent state * then * she 'll seek another parliamentary approval to hold a referendum . 
  timed correctly sturgeon could have her allies lined up and constitutional law ducks in a row * before * we have new pm . 
  yes . . but there 's a gigantic pile of shared assets we 'd quite like to chat about with ruk rather than just throwing up our hands and shouting * `` i 'm out '' * . 
   i am starting to feel sorry for the folks there  greece flag =(, 
  i hate that fucking movie . 
  dublin , frankfurt and eventually edinburgh if indyref2 happens . 
  nope , it 's a unitary state with devolved regional parliaments . 
  power is handed downward from westminster , not upward from the constituent countries . 
  westminster parliament could , technically , completely abolish the devolved parliaments tomorrow . 
  it 's unlikely there would be a period of independent scotland outside the eu but considering applying . 
  the position of the snp at least has always been to negotiate an overlap in this situation . 
  either scotland becomes independent and within the eu * before * the uk fully leaves ** or ** some date is picked ( end of 2 year article 50 perhaps ) where it all comes into effect at the same time . 
  the devolved scottish government does n't currently have the legal authority to call a recognised constitutional referendum . 
  westminster is sovereign , it has to allow it . 
  for the first referendum it happened after a majority of scottish msps were elected with a referendum in the manifesto - westminster granted the referendum because it was obviously the will of the scottish electorate . 
  * this * time the snps manifesto had this specific situation in it , except rather than holding a specific referendum it demanded that the scottish government is given the right to hold a constitutional referendum whenever it wants .
