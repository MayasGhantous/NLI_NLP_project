  then you 're wrong , gg . 
  we do n't think that . 
  we already have a federal britain though , gordon brown promised us this . 
  would n't ireland welcome a voting partner of a similar size with similar requirements from the eu ? 
  that 's not true . 
  there have only been 3 general elections since the end of the war where scotland 's vote would have changed the outcome . 
  only * 1 * of those occasions would have switched the governing party . 
  ams/d ` hondt makes outright majority wins nearly impossible . 
  if holyrood used fptp the snp would have had 40 + seat majorities for the past decade . 
  100 of 128 seats kind of scale last term . 
  he 's supposed to be making a 6 minute speech , it 's not fmqs , she would have to intervene on his speech to respond . 
  it has to seek permission from the rest of the uk to hold that referendum . 
  he linked to the snp constitution page . 
  the * quote * is from the snp 2016 holyrood manifesto . 
  https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thesnp/pages/5540/attachments/original/1485880018/snp_manifesto2016-web_ ( 1 ) . pdf ? 1485880018 page 24 . 
  i have a literal physical copy of that manifesto , picked up at the launch the bbc article i linked you to is discussing . 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-36084261 ) it was launched april 2016 elected may 2016 brexit june 2016, 
   that was written after the eu referendum though . 
  no , it was n't . 
   if comparing with other countries , nearly 40 % actively voting to leave is quite a lot 45 % of scotland * actively voted * to leave the uk . 
  it was 55 % in what used to be the second city of the british empire . 
  no , scotland would go from being 1/10 of a country to being ** 1/1 ** of a country , free to choose to join or leave whichever organizations it democratically decides it wants to . 
  [ as has been covered already ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4pxaaj/nicola_sturgeon_would_consider_blocking_brexit/d4ok1u5/ ) there is no , was never and will never be a holyrood veto on uk policy . 
  there ** is ** absolutely a massive constitutional crisis on the horizon caused by deliberate ignorance of the existing devolution settlement . 
  what is this weird bullshit that we expect england to stay in the eu at our behest ? 
  some compromise would be great . 
   then you have sturgeon using every excuse in the book to call for a referendum after the snp promised the 2014 ref was a one time thing . 
  you call it ` every excuse in the book ' . 
  i call it a manifesto commitment she was re-elected on in may just last year . 
   if she votes again and scotland votes to stay , she 's going to find it very hard to push for a third vote in the future . 
  the snp will pivot quite easily to a devomax/federalist party . 
  they 've always been * sort of there * anyway , gradualism was always the basic plan and they did start pivoting after the first indyref . 
  if brexit had n't happened we would n't be talking about independence again for a while - but it did , so here we are . 
   sadly , it seems that the number of voters switching from no to yes on scottish independence ( such as myself ) have been mostly balanced by the number switching from yes to no . 
  it 's true but it is n't sad . 
  you 've never voted yes before . 
  * they have * . 
  whatever the length of time is between the loss and the scottish electorate voting to hold another . 
   before that we were one country in laws [ not true ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scots_law ) scotland has had a distinct legal system from before , and during , the union . 
  it 's continuance was enshrined in article 19 of the act of union . 
  is hate the only alternative to love ? 
   if you ask that or `` should scotland remain a part of the united kingdom ? '', 
  you get different results . 
  the electoral commission disagrees with you . 
   a less common view that emerged in our research was that the question was biased towards a ` yes ' vote ' because it does not present the alternative to scotland being independent , that is , that it should remain part of the uk . 
  this was also put by some respondents submitting their views to us . 
   however , as we noted in considering whether the question was unambiguous , research participants understood ` independent country ' as meaning independent of the rest of the uk . 
   there was no evidence from our research that people felt they were being encouraged to vote ` yes ' because the question did not specifically mention the status quo . 
  [ electoral commission question report , page 32 ] ( http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/153691/referendum-on-independence-for-scotland-our-advice-on-referendum-question.pdf ), 
  we voted against independence , not * for * unity , that was just the only other option on the ballot . 
  assuming there 's widespread love of the uk in scotland would be a mistake . 
  your mother does indeed have a lovely box . 
  will you be home for christmas dinner ? 
   really ? 
  can a woman disagree to sharia law ? 
  can she reject the ruling ? 
  yes . 
   allowing alternative legal systems - great idea . 
  it is , for the most part it keeps petty cultural nonsense out of real courts . 
  the issue is one of social pressure and education , not the existence of mediation . 
  judge judy is an alternative legal system under the same concept . 
  world 's greatest contrarians . 
  * `` use these laws they are better !, 
  '' * ** no , go away ** * `` okay then use your own laws . 
  '' * ** you ca n't tell us what laws to use , we 'll use yours and you ca n't stop us ... how d'you like them apples big guy ? 
  ** * these fuckers are crazy , somebody build a wall *, 
  ugh , not this again . 
  that 's a lovely box . 
   your weather is awful , your beaches are awful , your food is awful , and your highest mountain is the ben nevis , which is at most a big hill . 
  your main team also got beaten by iceland . 
  honestly , this is extremely unfair . 
   italy 's weather is nice , has nice beaches , its food is third to none and its highest mountain is the mont blanc , albeit the worst part . 
  italy got barely beaten by germany after an epic penalty shoutout . 
  france/italy rivalry seems much more fair to me . 
  hey now , do n't hold us responsible for that ancient pile of unimpressive fat boulders , that football team is all england 's problem . 
  the * other * black stuff . 
   * accuse person of waffling . 
   * write 4x as much as they did , centered only on your own opinions . 
   what does google need to do to become eu compliant ? 
  looking back through vestager 's comments on google over the years - and how maps / flights / etc are all in line for investigation - they 'll probably have to make their various search embeds explicitly opt-in * or * have the individual shopping landing pages compete alongside the idealoo / kelkoo / etc landing pages in the organic search results . 
  in theory google could also open up the pinned/embed areas to data being brought in * from * those providers and then rank between them more fairly but that would end up being a very meta comparison engine for comparison engines for product prices , so i 'm not sure that could work . 
   so because google owns a large market share they are not allowed to promote their own options before others ? 
  they 're a business , that 's how it works . 
  the key factor is * how large * of a market share . 
  controlling a dominant share of the market obligates a company to be mindful of anti-trust laws . 
  google search holds over 90 % of the market in the eu . 
  they 're ** way ** into anti-trust law territory . 
  it 's not a new concept , competition laws have been around since at least the normal conquest . 
  contributes towards the eu budget , effectively slicing a little off the member state contributions next year . 
  one thing that has to be absolutely clear to understand this ; the commission did not ( and does not have to ) recommend an alternative arrangement . 
  it can impose fines for wrongdoing , it is then google 's responsibility to stay within the regulations or risk being fined again ( or worse ) . 
  the commission investigation is regulatory , like an ftc fine , not a court of law . 
  there was no private plaintiff . 
  if you are a company that maintains a dominant market position , which google is in regards to search in the eu , you take on * additional * regulatory obligations that forbid you from leveraging your position in that market to achieve a dominant position in another market ( price comparison ) the ruling was not concerned with placements of paid adsense advertisments . 
  it 's focus is entirely on google 's practice of displaying results/data ( paid or otherwise ) from their shopping comparison engine * above * the organic results of its competitors . 
  that act alone unfairly advantaged their secondary service 's position in its market at the expense of its competitors . 
  again , the dominance of google as a search engine is not the issue . 
  how it conducts itself from that dominant position in terms of it 's subsidiary/sister/secondary services and the effects it has on those sister services ' competitors is the issue . 
  the net effect is the same . 
  competitor price comparison sites ca n't buy that kind of prominent sidebar position .
