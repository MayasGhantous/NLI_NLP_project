did we annex ireland , or did they annex northern ireland ? 
  24-2 vote in the eu council , and every country bar one elected meps who are part of the epp . 
  why did you elect a guy who ran a tax haven for 24 years to be head of the eu ? 
  we were the only country to not back him with meps , and one of only two who voted against him in the eu council . 
  i think it is more likely that everyone feels offended , as they are lumped in with all the bad ones . 
   how do you separate the good apples from the bad , without offending a lot of people and being called a bigot ? 
  by labelling all the apples bad you will * not * offend people and be called a bigot ? 
  i want less immigration too , but i do n't think you have thought this through . 
  i did n't say they were , but i could n't reasonably link to all 30 immigration policies as examples . 
  if we leave we can accept as many eu migrants as we want . 
  this does not change that . 
  because it is a sham marriage to dodge immigration rules ? 
  those are [ illegal in the uk ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/256257/sham_marriage_and_civil_partnerships.pdf ) . 
  leaving the eu = / = stopping all immigration from europe . 
  paying for water is n't unusual - a lot of countries do it that way . 
  they have awareness of what 's happening * inside * the m25 ? 
  that 's news to me . 
  every country always seems to have these problems , therefore iceland has had them longer than the usa . 
  our payments to brussels have [ quadrupled ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/31/britain-eu-contribution-rise-quadruple-cameron ) in five years - it 's not just the last bill that annoys people . 
  it 's a jab at people who say those are the reasons half of the uk wants out of the eu . 
  i 'm fairly sure that still happens here ... 
  that data shows italy has gone from 23,045 thousand jobs to 22,446 thousand jobs . 
  not literally the same , but similar . 
  the uk does n't have a currency or oil issue with the eu , for instance . 
  hey - we have lots of islands !, 
  they do , just slowly . 
  hence `` ever closer union '' in the treaty of rome . 
  you ca n't get `` ever closer '' without bumping into each other at some point . 
  if we were outside the eu now , we definitely would n't be voting to join . 
  the only thing keeping us in is fear of the unknown , the same is probably true of scotland in the uk . 
  `` core principles '' is a bit of a weak argument . 
  the single market is a `` core principle '' but it does n't extend to the stuff we are good at , like services or [ banking ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/10957871/ecb-and-uk-clash-over-euro-clearing-house-ban.html ) , and [ france ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/05/16/france-breaks-european-union-law-to-block-ge-bid-for-alstom/ ) and [ italy ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/18440893 ) seem to be able to ignore it at will . 
  79 % of the 1098 people they asked supported it . 
  that is 867 people , which is 48 % of the entire 1808 people surveyed . 
  the british government would say yes , the eu would say no . 
  9 % are unsure , 13 % think we should put up with it because other countries put up with rules they dislike . 
  of the total people polled ( the data here is on a 60 % subset ) , 23 % want to keep freedom of movement and 15 % do n't know . 
  i think most brits would be fine with that . 
  points system in , points system out . 
  not many british people go abroad to provide low skilled labour , given the wages are either comparable or lower , and we usually do n't speak the language . 
  it you rebase it , it comes out at about 48 % support , 31 % oppose . 
  letting nato know it can reach all of europe with bombers that can carry nuclear weapons ? 
  left wing newspapers are positive ( broadsheets ) to mixed ( tabloids ) , whilst the right wing newspapers range from critical ( broadsheets ) to foaming at the mouth ( tabloids ) . 
  the tv media are meant to be impartial , but the bbc has found it has had a '' [ deep liberal bias ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/03/bbc-deep-liberal-bias-immigration ) '' in some areas , such as being pro-eu . 
  how do small groups of people currently defend themselves from the majority in romania ? 
  romanians make up about 4 % of the eu population . 
  4 % of romanians would be iasi county , or your romani minority . 
  what do they do to make sure romania as a whole has their interests at heart ? 
  does it work ? 
  scale it up , and that is what romanians could do on the eu level . 
  would a `` google tax '' be subject to the rules on new eu wide taxes , in that every member gets a veto ? 
  the current egyptian government hate hamas and are embargoing gaza , i doubt they want open borders . 
   are average europeans really this unfriendly to asian guys especially koreans/viets/mongols ? 
  not in the uk . 
  i 'd say that east asians are the group least likely to have issues , behind people from the anglosphere and western europe . 
  there is n't much of a stereotype for koreans , but the more general east asian one is that you are hard working and polite due to your pushy parents . 
   moreover , can i change my first name to european style ? 
  yes , you can call yourself whatever you want . 
  legal changes do n't have many restrictions either , and are quite easy to do . 
   lastly , i do know this is very silly question but are there any ways to look more western via plastic surgery or makeup ? 
  if that is what floats your boat , then almost definitely . 
  we have lots of very good plastic surgeons if you have lots of money . 
  makeup seems to be able to do almost anything nowadays - look at [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lym5-t5yzqi#t=155 ) . 
  i think they would n't block the referendum , merely slow it down enough that scotland would be voting post-eu exit , as that would probably be electorally advantageous . 
  i do n't know - if the uk leaves the eu , scotland would almost definitely not have the negotiating power to get opt-outs from things like the euro , assuming it wants to be in the eu . 
  there could be no yes argument about eu citizenship being irrevocable and scotland already being a member . 
  i think independence would be more likely , but still very uncertain . 
  some proposed solutions connect the two halves of palestine with a sovereign strip of road . 
  the un mandate that created israel had palestinian territories fairly close together relative to the current de facto borders . 
  i doubt anyone would willingly divide their country in half , even if the un ordered it . 
  there were less than 60 member states of the un at the time it ordered the creation of israel , it was n't exactly a representative body . 
  we do n't have quorums . 
  it just was n't a binding vote - i do n't know why , but maybe it was to ensure it passed . 
  yeah , fairly . 
  our upper house contains people who are there because they are nobles and others who are there because they are members of england 's state religion . 
  the rest are merely appointed by the government and opposition !, 
  not literally , as our head of state is neither in the council nor elected . 
  it 's a mixture of heads of state and heads of government . 
   are you aware of the `` this content is not available in your country '' pages on youtube ? 
  that 's not an issue i have experienced in the uk . 
  i thought it was only germany which had significant issues with youtube . 
  given that there was a `` no '' lead in every poll but one , i think that is unlikely . 
  fighting diseases is what we should be using our foreign aid and army on , not invading random countries and bribing people to buy our stuff . 
  it saves lives at home and abroad , it helps other countries develop , it improves diplomatic relations , it increases average [ iq ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0160289611000572 ) and quality of life , it helps develop export markets , it reduces the numbers of people needing asylum , it boost the world economy ... the list is endless , and has something for everyone . 
  depending on your view point , the exact wrong time would probably be immediately before an eu referendum or general election . 
  i do n't see how that is hypocritical . 
  he is putting money before diplomatic relations in both cases , and is not unpopular at home for doing so . 
  the left want more voters , the right want cheap labour for business . 
  we have a law now that ensures a `` referendum lock '' on any significant transfer of powers to the eu , and the opposition has agreed to keep it , so that 's one area where they are in agreement . 
  the quota should be based on quality , not an arbitrary quantity . 
  make a tv show out of it . 
  round one could be salafist vs fascist , round two would be fascist v antifa and so on . 
  all voluntary of course . 
  winner gets to pick an opponent of their choice to put on a government watch list . 
  there is n't really a pan-eu channel , language or proven audience that could be targeted . 
  it would be too tough to sell it to advertisers . 
  yes , though when you say it it sounds fairly awful . 
  `` we ca n't give you what you want , because loads of other people want that too '' . 
  i guess the greeks did have a colony in marseilles . 
  i do n't understand the portuguese-irish or the greek-french/dutch/lithuanian links .
