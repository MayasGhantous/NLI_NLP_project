  what is you definition of europe ? 
  it seems to include `` ancients '' and switzerland but not russia . 
  scotland and wales are n't much different !, 
  i 'm not thinking of us , we 've got a nice big moat and an opt-out of schengen - more greece and italy . 
  if something happens to her , who takes over ? 
  people were asking for somewhere to send the people crossing into europe , i guess this could be it . 
  i think the anti-immigration party in the netherlands is in favour of gay rights . 
  it seems to be posts that ( some ? ), 
  mods want to delete under zealous application of [ rule 1.1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) , but do n't because it pisses off the users . 
  it will redistribute from well-off countries to less well-off ones , so finland will lose out . 
  either finnish taxes will have to go up , or finnish spending will have to come down . 
  granting asylum would probably be less controversial if nobody was be allowed to stay once the situation they fled from ended . 
  some people would n't like the reduction in rights for accepted asylum seekers , whilst others would n't like the increased numbers , but overall it would probably maximise how many people were saved . 
  my understanding is that some believe john would no longer be kate 's husband but her partner ( and vice versa ) , and the gender roles entailed by being a husband or wife ( which they value ) would no longer be officially recognised . 
  the `` we '' seems to refer to society , rather than the law . 
  a third way exists alright , but nobody wants to fund it . 
  france could probably send greece the money right now if it wanted . 
  it 's not fair to call it german austerity - without germany greece would be spending even less , because greece would have defaulted by now . 
  they appear to be protesting against the mosque/islam , rather than against the involvement of the turkish government . 
  can any one country veto nato action ? 
  i 'd have thought the usa and others could send troops to estonia regardless of german opposition . 
  the eurozone , presumably . 
  i think you 'd need an actual majority in the polls for something this big to go through - people tend to prefer the status quo . 
  blame the eu , not the uk :  [ in a 107-page judgment [ pdf ] that is long on economic theory and short on common sense , the high court examined the industry 's assertion that because content that can be copied has more value than content that ca n't -- we agree with that part -- the rightsholder ought to be able to capture that added value -- a far more dubious claim , but one to which the unbalanced ** european copyright directive ** gives some credence . 
  ] ( https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/european-copyright-madness-court-strikes-down-law-allowing-users-rip-their-own-cds ), 
  the basis for this is the courts applying the european copyright directive , do n't blame us . 
  have a referendum on it , see which countries want more eu . 
  i do n't think many will be in favour . 
  we 're already 77,000 ahead of iceland !, 
  he 's a genius - he promised everything , delivered nothing , yet his popularity has only grown . 
  parts of north africa do it to italy , italy does it to france , france does it to the uk - i 'm not having a go at serbia in particular . 
  it is n't in their interest - these people are probably not going to stay in serbia any longer than they have to . 
  i think the rest of the world is more sympathetic to greece because they do not owe us lots of money . 
  he 's eurosceptic in that he wants to strengthen the national parliaments versus the eu , limit the powers of the echr , cut the eu budget , limit freedom of movement and to remain outside of the euro . 
  the conservatives are mostly eurosceptic now , even if they do n't all want to leave . 
  wikipedia says there are only 140,000 irish speakers in ireland ... 
  the last poll in favour of leaving was published as recently as february , it 's not a settled matter . 
  is that a valid use of money though ? 
  there are over 60 indigenous languages and probably hundreds of non-indigenous ones that could ask for translators - we have to draw the line somewhere . 
  welsh and catalan are treated like arabic , rather than like irish , despite all three of the former having more speakers than the latter . 
  we exclude far bigger languages - there are more punjabi , urdu , bengali , gujarati , yoruba or arabic speakers in the uk alone than irish speakers in ireland . 
  the guardian reports that only 40 % of failed asylum seekers in the eu are deported . 
   [ between them , seven countries -- or one-quarter of the eu -- fielded more than three-quarters of asylum applications . 
  most fail . 
  but although 425,000 claims were denied in 2013 , less than 40 % of those failures resulted in deportation . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/mediterranean-migrant-crisis-no-european-migration-policy ), 
  the ecb 's website suggests this is not possible : ---------- a number of institutional arrangements for sound fiscal policies have been agreed at the eu level , also with a view to limiting risks to price stability . 
  these include : - the prohibition of monetary financing ( article 123 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ) , - the prohibition of privileged access to financial institutions ( article 124 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ) , - the ** no-bail-out clause ** ( article 125 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ) , - the fiscal provisions to avoid excessive government deficits ( article 126 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union , including the excessive deficit procedure ) , and - the stability and growth pact ( secondary legislation based on articles 121 and 126 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ) . 
  if the aim was to terrorise the population of the country they were located in , then yes it would be . 
  anything given to pay off a loan frees other money to spend on the greek economy . 
  many parties variously described as `` hard right '' `` far right '' or `` right wing '' have social policies that might be described as right wing ( pro national sovereignty , anti-immigration , harsh punishment for criminals ) , but economic policies that might be more associated with the left ( protectionism , interventionism , money for pensioners , etc ) . 
  why is ireland at less per citizen than slovakia ? 
  we want them rescued , but by other people . 
  the only country we 've chosen to lend money to is ireland . 
  it looks like any potential renegotiation wo n't be worth the paper it is written on , unless we get treaty change to go with it . 
  that might affect the result of the referendum . 
  as the bailout only needs 85 % of voting rights in favour if emergency measures are invoked , it can pass with as few as 6 of the 17 member states voting in favour ( germany , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , greece ) . 
  we could n't rejoin , we 'd have lost all of our opt outs . 
  joining the euro and schengen is n't going to pass a referendum . 
  if you do n't want germay controlling your currency , do n't join a currency union with them ... 
  evidently not so cruel that a default was the more attractive option . 
  i guess you ca n't rule out a leadership change of one of the other parties , or the formation of a less extreme anti-memorandum party . 
  the risk then was communism from the pacific to the atlantic , now the risk is from the agean to the ionian . 
  it 's not seem as the same existential threat that in the past led to us doing whatever it took to keep the communists out . 
  98 % of the population of the eu is n't greece - a federation would give greece no power over their bailout . 
  maybe a different history to the one you are thinking of - greece was expelled from the now defunct [ latin monetary union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_monetary_union#failure ) in 1908 . 
  would n't that be germany , as they are the largest eurozone economy ? 
   because no one gives a fuck about so-called `` european solidarity '' . 
  never did . 
  it was all about money and spheres of influence . 
  plenty of people here could have told you that a while ago . 
  when churchill spoke of a united states of europe , he meant for us to be firmly outside of it . 
  greece would make up ~ 2 % of a federal eu - in practice they would have no say then either . 
  the british and french armies have a limited degree of power projection , but other than that i doubt there is much any eu state could do outside of its immediate vicinity other than help the usa . 
  they were n't acting because it was the common good , but because it was for their own benefit . 
  thankfully the two coincided , but from what we are seeing in the eurozone that may not be the case for greece . 
  nobody is going to war , if for no other reason than for the fact that we all have fairly crap armies . 
  he calls `` complete destruction of national sovereignty '' a `` grotesque betrayal of everything the european project was supposed to stand for '' - is n't that sort of the point of the eu anyway ? 
  it was under blair , but immigration has risen up the agenda a lot more now . 
  labour has repeatedly described their policy that led to such high levels of immigration as [ a mistake ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11547241/ed-miliband-labour-got-it-wrong-on-immigration-it-is-not-prejudiced-to-be-concerned.html ) . 
   other countries have been so generous in the past to you when it comes to debt relief that was n't done out of charity , but to build up a barrier against communism . 
  the bigger failure would have been uniting a continent that does not see itself as one country . 
  that is what it looks like to me , the uk is the same grey as russia and switzerland . 
  the eu may want that , but some member states may not . 
  i 'd imagine the uk might have a problem , given the fuss over romania in the first place . 
  `` sorting it '' will probably see greece exit the eurozone and have their economy implode at a minimum . 
  nobody wants to be blamed for that , so everyone is desperate for another party to be the one to pull the plug . 
  it 's trade agreements that eu countries ca n't sign with china , not any treaty . 
  the article describes this treaty as co-operation on `` infrastructure and energy projects '' . 
  the [ 20th of july ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-27/greece-risk-timeline-why-july-20-matters-most ) appears to be the next final deadline . 
  left wing and pro-eu . 
  some people do n't like the fact that it is possible for the eu to do this at all , and that is what they are outraged about . 
  thanks !, 
  is n't smaller better when it comes to computers ? 
  i 'm not sure you 've thought this through . 
  the [ eurobarometer archives ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb40/eb40_en.pdf ) have polling that shows the uk was the only country where the majority of the population opposed the maastricht treaty when it was signed . 
  cameron 's leverage is his endorsement - if the conservatives backed out it could make a huge difference to the outcome . 
  the conservative vote combined with the other eusceptic parties came to just over 50 % of the vote in the 2015 general election and the 2014 eu elections . 
   the eu was never meant to be a mere economical project . 
  i think it was/is for many people in the uk , which may explain some of the problem .
