  i guess , but i just ca n't see a government not abiding by one other than in exceptional circumstances . 
  it 'd be too costly electorally . 
  if they were n't prepared to follow through they just would n't hold the referendum in the first place . 
  not in theory , but they pretty much are in practice . 
  we could n't save france from falling despite them being right next door . 
  what do you think we could have done for poland when you were simultaneously being invaded by the soviet union ? 
   primary balance would be automatically enforced i ca n't see that working , given how many countries ignore the current deficit rules . 
  greece has defaulted seven times since 1800 , versus four times for germany .

  sure , but it is still a thing : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_neutrality, 
  that 's the same thing :  go to war  phrase of war  1 . declare , begin , or see active service in a war . 
  [ they may already have been printed in 2012 ... ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/29/greek-drachma-rumours-banknote-printer ), 
  we have rules on how referendums work ; cameron could campaign as the conservative leader but not as the pm . 
   purdah is the pre-election period in the united kingdom , specifically the time between an announced election and the final election results . 
  [ 1 ] the time period prevents central and local government from making announcements about any new or controversial government initiatives ( such as modernisation initiatives or administrative and legislative changes ) which could be seen to be advantageous to any candidates or parties in the forthcoming election . 
  where actual advantage to candidates is proven in law based on precedent cases to have been given this amounts to a breach of section 2 of the local government act 1986 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purdah_ ( pre-election_period ), 
   i do n't want to live in a europe where the fundamentals of democracy and law can be put aside to achieve a political goal . 
  you need to find a new europe then , the eu project has been taking precedence over democracy for a while now . 
   `` there can be no democratic choice against the european treaties . '', 
  juncker on greece , 2015, 
   so for nato a stern phone call could also do the trick , while the eu defense treaty requires you to roll out all your tanks . 
  unless you are a constitutionally neutral eu member , in which case you can just do nothing . 
  we actually did go to war over that scrap of paper , and then again over another when poland was invaded . 
   the uk and denmark negotiated opt outs but for the rest membership requires commitment to use the euro . 
  only if you meet the entry criteria , which is how sweden is getting away with staying outside of it . 
  the imf [ always gets repaid eventually ] ( http://www.npr.org/2012/02/03/146327391/why-imf-loans-always-get-repaid ) , we 're not really at risk there . 
  this is the last i heard of it :  [ brussels -- the european union 's antitrust office on friday released a preliminary finding that a tax deal between amazon and the luxembourg government appears to amount to unfair state aid that may have enabled the company to underpay its taxes for a decade or more . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/business/amazon-luxembourg-european-commission.html ), 
  i understand why luxembourg did it - our loss was their gain - and we did do something about it , and the practice has stopped . 
  luxembourg does n't need to concern itself with internal uk affairs , but there are eu rules against having special deals with companies to help them avoid tax . 
   but right now is only signalling to the euroskeptic and on-the-fence electorate that eu institutions already think they are more important than the will of european peoples . 
  was anyone in any doubt about this ? 
   `` if it 's a yes , we will say ` on we go ' , and if it 's a no we will say ` we continue ' . '', 
  on the french lisbon treaty referendum , 2005  `` when it becomes serious , you have to lie . '', 
  2013  `` there can be no democratic choice against the european treaties . '', 
  on greece , 2015, 
  if the market is shown that countries will leave the euro if they are having a bad time then they may factor this risk in accordingly . 
  you 'd get companies operating in the uk ( or elsewhere ) pretending to be based in luxembourg in order to dodge uk taxes , and luxembourg would help them to do this . 
  that 's easy to say when we are not the ones holding the debt . 
  if it looks like our veto will be the only way to get any concessions from the eu , i ca n't see the threat of it not being used . 
  we were told it was impossible for the treaties to be opened before our referendum . 
  cameron would risk rebellion if he did n't make his own demands . 
  villainous governments do n't just happen to a country , they have to win elections first . 
  not all of the sex gangs , just a disproportionate amount . 
  there is a huge problem which seems to correlate with being pakistani or a muslim , just not at the scale you are implying . 
  it 'd be cool at first , but in the long run we 'd be in competition for resources , so it is probably best it is only us . 
  we 've seen humans perform genocide on other humans just for being a different ethnicity or religion ; if there were beings of another species i ca n't think it 'd go very well . 
  yep , and some asians and pacific islanders have denisovian dna too . 
   we are a european union . 
  not a survival of the fittest union . 
  the experience of greece suggests that we are not a european union , we are 28 countries that care more about themselves than each other . 
   how the fuck are the greek people responsible when their governments lied to them about the country 's finances for the better part of a decade ? 
  if a country keeps electing liars , who is to blame ? 
  whilst it is true they do n't make enough stuff , exports do n't actually measure that - you have to look at domestic consumption too . 
  i 'm talking about the federal government , which spends $ 3.5 t compared to $ 1.5 t by the individual states . 
  the balance of power in the eu is very different - $ 0.12 t by the eu versus $ 6.2 t by the member states . 
  some people ( not myself ) value the gender roles they see as implicit in a marriage - a husband to do man things and a wife to do woman things . 
  if marriage is no longer defined as between a husband and a wife , they think it may affect the legitimacy of their assigned gender role . 
  i do n't fully understand that argument , but that 's the best explanation i can offer . 
  i think the will of the people should lead to the formation of a new country , rather than the inconvenience of sharing a currency but not a country . 
  well yes , but nobody wants that . 
  did you see the fuss about germans interfering with the last lot of greek elections ? 
  yes , but new york gets a say in running south carolina . 
  yes , but the eu is not a country . 
  we can either break economies by ending the euro , or break democracies by ending national sovereignty . 
  either works , but i prefer the former . 
  or on ending the eurozone to accommodate national sovereignty over fiscal and tax measures . 
  i 'm not expert , but i was just working from this list , which could be wrong for all i know : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_default#examples_of_sovereign_default, 
   what else are they suppose to do ? 
  just give them money for eternity ? 
  that is what eu federalists seem to want , though they prefer to call it a `` fiscal union '' . 
   you ca n't send a bunch of folks to repossess the assets . 
  greece is doing that for the creditors already , hence the privatisations . 
   you think rich areas of portugal do n't `` bail out '' or subsidise the poorer areas ? 
  of course they do , but they also have a say in how that money is spent . 
  i think it 's actually english law in this case , as scotland has its own legal system . 
  i think it 's because they agreed to follow english law when they borrowed the money , rather than greek . 
  that makes it cheaper to borrow precisely because they ca n't just rewrite the law to say they do n't owe anything . 
  no , the eurozone taxpayers bought them out of greek debt . 
  loads of countries that have gone bust can borrow again now . 
  iceland 's bonds are even investment rated . 
  very few people want to give lots of money away to other countries for the rest of eternity . 
  transfers are n't even that popular within countries , let alone between them . 
  is there a stereotype that we get a lot of fog in the uk ? 
  it 's actually pretty rare . 
  [ this ] ( http://web2.airmail.net/danb1/european.htm ) is the only source i can find right now , but london is n't even in the top 10 major european cities for fog ( or rainfall ) . 
  we are pretty good for boring weather ( # 1 ) and days with rain ( # 3 ) though . 
  as there is no political or financial union - and no desire for one - there should be no monetary union . 
  no , if you are n't in greece there is n't much risk of anything happening . 
  it was n't done for the good of the british mainland ; like everyone else , the people in charged were acting in their own interests . 
  as the thread is stickied , there is no reason to up/down vote it other than to protest the actions of the mods - it will be visible either way . 
  if you are going to get df immigration policies and df economic policies , why do n't you have a df government ? 
  i do n't disagree with the sentiment , but he does n't write in english with a french translation - he writes in french with an english translation . 
  i 'm asking about us states , as that would be the equivalent to chechnya in russia . 
  which us state did obama hand to a warlord ? 
  [ france is top industrial espionage offender ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20110104-france-industrial-espionage-economy-germany-russia-china-business ) [ paris also snoops on us , says french former spy boss ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20131024-nsa-france-spying-squarcini-dcri-hollande-ayrault-merkel-usa-obama ), 
  not really , it is just a set of rules used to determine how the country is governed . 
  we do have a constitution , albeit a largely unwritten one , and it does n't limit the influence of parliament . 
  you have to have your own currency if you want your democracy back . 
  it 's obvious that someone in germany/finland/the netherlands identifies as german/finnish/dutch rather than eurozone-ian , so expecting them to do something that is n't seen to be in the german/finnish/dutch interest is n't going to work .
