  because some ez countries do n't trust other ez countries not to try to turn a bailout into a transfer union . 
   also , since when is 51 % most ? 
  what do you think most means ? 
  i ca n't think of when < 50 % is n't most . 
  you wo n't have caused the misery , and your investment would be needed to help end it . 
  the toll is only for the severn bridge , there are some other ways to get to wales that are free to use . 
  greece is free to choose between the two . 
   it is the reurozone that is avoiding the necessary solution , which is fiscal union . 
  the best solution for the eurozone is not necessarily the best solution for its individual members . 
  if the european project requires something the electorates are not willing to give , then the european project has failed . 
   if you want your country to be wealthy and successful you should do whatever opposite the imf prescribe everyone is free to ignore them completely if they do n't want imf money . 
  south korea , new zealand and norway are all pretty good places to live . 
  in fairness , americans just pronounce it vi-ta-min - there is n't an inherently correct way of doing it . 
  no , just frowned upon . 
  i think some of the creditors view syriza as trying to blackmail them into funding policies that are unaffordable for a country with greece 's productivity level . 
  i think people are suggesting greece develops some industry , rather than that is already has one to fall back on . 
  it 'd take quite a while to manage that though . 
  surely the relevant `` you '' here is either nato or the eu , as both have mutual defence clauses . 
  using the definition found here , the two are n't exclusive . 
  the eu parliament 's [ wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament ) lists the `` government '' ( eu commission ) as having the support of 478/751 meps . 
  is the uk the only country to have a majority of its meps ( 53 of 73 ) outside of this `` government '' ? 
  if the question is what to do if you are invaded , then obviously war is the answer whether you want one or not . 
  you have to go to war for estonia , else you may end up having to go to war for lithuania or poland or germany or whoever in the future . 
  i do n't think we 'd try to push into russia if we won though , for fear of mad . 
  i was n't trying to bash the ussr - they just did what every other country did , which was to act in what was thought to be their own best interest . 
  the british empire would n't have existed if we particularly cared about morals . 
  expat is generally used as a synonym for emigrant rather than immigrant , is n't it ? 
  i could call a british person in spain an expat or emigrant , whereas you would call them an immigrant , and we 'd both be right . 
  london has 40 fewer rainy days and less than half the precipitation of ljubljana ... 
  it cost our government about three billion quid , according to wikipedia . 
   i 'd much rather have germany be a russian province than a nuclear wasteland in that you are no different from anyone else , which is why we need nato 's nuclear weapons . 
  as long as an invasion risks a nuclear war , it does n't make sense for either side to start one . 
   the allies did n't fight the axis because nazism is evil . 
  they fought the axis because axis was bombing uk , invading ussr , and blowing up us ships . 
  that 's not true - those happened * after * the allies declared war on germany . 
  [ france , the uk and others declared war on germany for invading poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii#war_breaks_out_in_europe_.281939.e2.80.9340.29 ) , and at that time the soviet union was co-operating with germany to divide up eastern europe . 
  maybe south korea , china , japan and the usa should form a union , that might help them trade some more . 
  hopefully the results would be different if the question emphasised that the nato member was defending against a russian invasion , rather than talking about if they `` got into a serious military conflict '' . 
   ok , so what is the way forward ? 
  perpetual transfers ? 
  debt cut and then new debt ? 
  i guess you could let them fail until they get back into line or leave the eurozone . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/voting-calculator/ ) 's a qmv calculator to play around with , if you want to see who is able to block the migration rules . 
   is there a source of what the judge said within the full context ? 
  there is quite a bit of context :  `` i do not believe there was punitively harsh treatment of [ the boy ] of the kind that would merit the term physical abuse . 
   `` proper allowance must be made for what is , almost certainly , a different cultural context . 
   `` within many communities newly arrived in this country , children are slapped and hit for misbehaviour in a way which at first excites the interest of child protection professionals . '', 
   `` in this instance ... ( the boy ) did not appear to have suffered more than sadness and transient pain from what was done to him . '', 
   and predictably now libya is a complete basket case . 
  leaving somewhere alone is no guarantee it will turn out better - look at syria . 
  the bottom 60 % of the uk 's population are net recipients of government spending , it 's not simply a question of whether or not you are working . 
   you should also ask dutch and british depositors how they feel about the way iceland handled the crisis and their savings . 
  iceland did the right thing - lots of our local councils lost a lot of money , but that is their fault . 
  you should n't be able to take the reward for risky investments but then pass the risks onto someone else . 
  one interesting side effect of disinvestment is that focusing your investment in [ `` sin stocks '' ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/933d2e1e-b146-11e4-831b-00144feab7de.html ) becomes a more profitable thing - which does suggest that it is having some sort of effect . 
  the ability to print money is n't the same as actually printing money - our creditors know it is impossible for us to go bust , so they charge us less interest , whereas greece 's are not so sure . 
   given the chance i 'd to run an alternative universe experiment and see what the current state of the eurozone would be had the uk joined we had a deficit of 11.8 % in 2010 , so without the ability to print money and run a huge deficit we might have suffered like greece has - only our economy is ten times the size , so a bailout might have been a little more tricky . 
  it may help a little , but it is by no means more accurate - the skin does n't operate in isolation from our other organs . 
  growing that skin on a mouse might be quite useful though , but it does n't do much for the mouse . 
  that might work with cosmetics , but i ca n't see it happening for medicines - the vast majority of people would not be willing to trade their health for animal welfare . 
  what benefits the uk will not necessarily benefit the majority of the eurozone - our economies have different strengths and weaknesses . 
  why would a country without any external eu border want to contribute to them ? 
  austrians are not worried about being attacked by russia , turkey or morocco , but finns , greeks and spaniards might have reason to be . 
  i ca n't see one happening - spain 's territory in africa is an integral part of spain , so it would presumably trigger nato 's collective self-defence clause . 
   first with the people that are up for it . 
  what happens with the people who are not - or those who are , but then change their mind ? 
  i do n't think there is going to be a proposal , as no country backs these reforms !, 
  we 've already had the ideas of monetary transfers , shared debt liability , corporation tax harmonisation , reopening the treaties and so on floated and rejected by one eu state or another . 
   `` if you vote yes , you 'll be thrown out of the eu !, 
  your only way to stay in the eu is to stay in the uk ! '', 
  that is still true though , is n't it ? 
  that does n't guarantee staying in the eu if you stay in the uk , only guarantees leaving the eu if you leave the uk . 
  i do n't think that is actually up to her , as scotland voted to be remain a part of the uk - and in the uk it is westminster that has the sole power to legislate for a referendum . 
  it 's not all scots on one side and the rest of the uk on the other , people are split on these questions throughout the whole of the uk . 
   after all this , a british-style eu referendum ai n't an option . 
  but a potential alternative is indefinitely blocking all attempts at further integration or forcing all further integration to referenda . 
  this kind of alternative have an 80 % guaranteed success . 
  you should try something like our [ referendum lock ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/future-eu/british-mps-vote-eu-referendum-l-news-501494 ) . 
  they 'd be better off pushing for a uk-style referendum lock - any significant further transfer of powers has to be approved by a referendum . 
  it 'd be more likely to return the result they are after , as getting to campaign for the status quo is usually an advantage . 
  i know they are not part of the uk , it 's that they are connected to argentina that is weird ... 
  they do n't operate in southern nigeria , which is much nearer to northern nigeria than europe is . 
  they seem connected fairly randomly - the falklands are connected to argentina here , whilst french guyana is not connected to france . 
  are there any other feasible candidates than sarkozy , hollande or le pen ? 
   is katie hopkins ' idea the actual public will ? 
  i think it often is , though not amongst the demographics that dominate social media . 
  there 's a reason the sun employ her ... 
  we agreed to use the highest number - it just so happens that as elizabeth was used more by english monarchs than scottish ones , the current one gets an `` english '' number . 
  as good as you can get in practice . 
  only 40 % of those who fail it get deported though !, 
   [ between them , seven countries -- or one-quarter of the eu -- fielded more than three-quarters of asylum applications . 
  most fail . 
  but although 425,000 claims were denied in 2013 , less than 40 % of those failures resulted in deportation .

  wales * is * a country though - just not a sovereign state , though the two have become almost synonymous . 
   [ wales ( listeni / \u02c8we\u026alz / ; welsh : cymru [ \u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268 ] ( listen ) ) is a ** country ** that is part of the united kingdom and the island of great britain , [ 6 ] bordered by england to its east , the irish sea to its north and west , and the bristol channel to its south . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wales ), 
  somali and sudanese people are almost all sunni , as are ~ 50 % of eritreans . 
  does any country accept the original proposals other than italy , sweden and greece ?
