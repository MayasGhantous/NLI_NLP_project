  maybe he does !, 
   [ `` britain is different . 
  of course there will be transfers of sovereignty . 
  but would i be intelligent to draw the attention of public opinion to this fact ? 
  i wonder how different the numbers would have been if `` in europe '' had been replaced by `` in the united kingdom '' . 
  never heard that before , though i 'm not scottish . 
  googling it suggests it was used by some foreign newspapers as a catchy way of talking about possible implications for the monarchy after the scottish referendum . 
  that 's not one of her titles - she 's officially the queen of great britain and northern ireland [ etc ] , as scotland and england became [ one kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_great_britain ) in 1707 . 
  they took on any position they thought would be more likely to win them the referendum - pro-nato , pro-tax cuts , pro-spending , pro-monarchy , pro-sterling , anti-eurozone , anti-schengen and so on . 
  any country that accepts money in return for taking legitimate refugees , as with papua new guinea . 
  australia did n't just dump them there without asking . 
  sweden has 107 natives per refugee , whilst italy has 1035 , according to wikipedia . 
  not easily - we have border controls with every country except ireland . 
  hungary appears to have brought some in to settle romania : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germans_of_romania, 
  they do care about corruption - plenty of them are participating in it . 
  there are n't enough people there to justify it - even the channel tunnel struggled to make a profit . 
  it 'd have to be northern ireland , given the map also colours in the rest of the island of ireland . 
  if it picked due to bribery it should be taken away . 
  why would that be a problem for romania ? 
   the topic is not immigrants . 
  the topic is refugees a refugee is an immigrant - an immigrant is :  [ a person who comes to a country to live there ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigrant ), 
  [ the economist explains : what david cameron wants from europe ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-29 ), 
   and afterwards vehemently advocated a `` united states of europe '' yes , but he did not include the uk in that . 
  we drill for oil just south of london , it can be done without much disturbance with the right regulations . 
  here 's a map : https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/425247/landfields_lics.pdf england is the country with the second highest population density in the eu after malta , if it can be done here it can be done in basque country . 
  i think a lot of them may have abandoned catholicism by now : http://ncronline.org/news/faith-parish/had-it-catholics, 
  we are helping , just in a different way . 
  our navy is there , and we give lots of money in foreign aid - more than any other country bar the usa . 
  it 's not very helpful to use `` us '' when your flair is set to earth . 
  yes , because every member of the eu has a veto on issues of taxation . 
  they basically never enter our waters/airspace , they just get extremely close to it . 
  i do n't think the imf really does negotiations - either you accept what they demand or you do n't get their money . 
  i think the idea is for commonwealth countries not to treat each other as foreign - so instead of having embassies with each other , we have high commissions , and so on . 
  the current rules help keep northern ireland calm - anyone living there can choose to be british or irish , and it does n't make a difference to your rights . 
  you can either ban your own citizens who have been living abroad for under 15 years ( scotland ) or residents who are citizens of eu countries ( uk ) . 
  i think scotland had to go for the former , as there is no record of which people in the rest of the uk would have been allowed to vote in scotland with the latter - as they would have become an elector in england/wales/northern ireland rather than an `` overseas elector '' tied to a particular scottish constituency . 
  not accounting for exchange rates ? 
   none of them passed it through a referendum . 
  that is because - as far as i 'm aware - none of the other countries had to change their constitution . 
  of course would n't want to lose almost half of our exports , but i doubt that would happen if we left - the eu is not north korea , it does trade with the outside world too . 
   there is also no reason not to introduce legislation saying that refugees are exempt from the eu freedom of movement , as they are not eu citizens . 
  given that there are no borders in schengen , i do n't see how you could enforce such a decision . 
   this is a common misconception - there is already a system in place . 
  for example france rejects 4 out of 5 applications for refugee status - http://www.thelocal.fr/20140324/france-asylum-refugee-rejects-four-out-of-five-asylum-seekers but :  [ between them , seven countries -- or one-quarter of the eu -- fielded more than three-quarters of asylum applications . 
  most fail . 
  but although 425,000 claims were denied in 2013 , ** less than 40 % of those failures resulted in deportation . 
  ** ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/mediterranean-migrant-crisis-no-european-migration-policy ) even with 80 % of claims rejected , we are looking at 68 % of people staying . 
   silicone valley [ silicone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silicone_rubber ) is the stuff they make fake boobs out of , you mean silicon . 
  the stricter countries are never going to agree to the proposals - why would they let generous countries have a say in their asylum policy if they do not get the same in return ? 
  is there not a correlation between urban areas and a young electorate ? 
  pensioners do n't need to live where the jobs are . 
  are there are any problems to which the commission does n't think more eu is the answer ? 
  it 's hardly news . 
  i think we would actually be very happy if every rule we had an issue with was revoked for all eu members rather than just the uk . 
  yes , some people dislike that the right to a family life can in some circumstances prevent someone being deported . 
  knowing the negotiating strategy of juncker , for instance , might be useful when deciding what topics to press for . 
  probably , because as far as i am aware the countries that have already legalised it do not define marriage in their constitutions . 
  exactly - we can also see it by looking at the state provision of healthcare to citizens . 
  the nhs here , for example , currently values one year of healthy life at [ ~ # 20,000 ] ( http://www.channel4.com/news/drugs-life-breast-cancer-nice-20-000-a-year-of-life-nhs ) . 
  there is no way around it , whilst we have finite money and a way in which we can convert money into life , we will always have to put a value on human life . 
  yes , because different people value the same thing differently . 
  you could get more money from a qatari than a bangladeshi for a bottle of water . 
   oh yeah , and the dignity of human beings is also invaluable , i guess . 
  nice words , but the evidence does not support that conclusion . 
  we can measure the value of something by looking at how much people are willing to spend on it , and in this case it is not a huge amount . 
  brussels would be a high priority too , i 'd imagine - nato and the eu are both headquartered there , and both are key to lithuania 's survival . 
  tariffs are not a huge barrier any more - we still trade plenty with the usa , china , south korea , japan and the like . 
  turkey is even in the eu customs area , whilst there are several other [ single markets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_market ) that do not include free movement . 
  i 'm sure there would be problems , but they are not as stark as is being made out . 
   what would be the reason for the rich countries to help them ? 
  to reduce the number of unwanted people coming here , to be blunt . 
  i get the impression that opt-outs are only given grudgingly , when the only alternative is that country using their veto . 
  i do n't think this measure is subject to a veto , so i doubt an opt-out will be offered . 
  i could be completely wrong , but getting stuff wrong also seems to be the best way of ensuring someone gives the right answer . 
   there 's no conceivable scenario in which any country would give up all the benefits of the eu . 
  our polls show it is fairly close between the status quo and leaving altogether . 
  if it was federation or abolition it would be a landslide vote to leave . 
   the scottish mainstream is the english extreme left not really . 
  they are just left-wing populists , most of their policies are fairly popular here too . 
  [ political views are n't actually that different either side of the border ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/09/the-myth-of-meritocratic-scotland/ ) . 
   progression of the european project i read in a newspaper that we 're getting an opt-out from that as part of cameron 's renegotiation . 
  no more `` ever closer union '' for the uk . 
  i do n't think australia is a prison-island any more . 
  we compete as the united kingdom , not england . 
   why is london doing so awful considering all the money thrown into there london is doing alright , but the money is being thrown from london , not at it . 
   i.e. , if you want to negotiate an `` opt-out '' , everyone needs to be subject to that opt-out . 
  that is what i was saying - this would just result in us vetoing everything . 
  the eu members who want to integrate would never be able to get anywhere . 
  we may think that , but the treaty of rome does call for `` ever closer union '' . 
  some areas where there have been calls for more integration include an integrated army , harmonised tax rates , an integrated energy market , a unified foreign policy , an eu wide asylum policy , a fiscal union , a banking union ... 
   east of england - 4.4 %  south west - 4.3 %  south east - 4.2 % i guess this is helps explain why those regions returned 182 conservative mps out of a possible 197 - almost 50 % of the vote in the south east was conservative , comparable to the snp in scotland . 
  yes , what we really want is lower wages . 
  it would n't be uganda we 'd be sending anyone back to , it would be sweden or germany . 
  immigration is actually ~ 625,000 gross ( ~ 550,000 non-british ) , or ~ 300,000 net ( ~ 353,000 non-british ) . 
  we were the only three who demanded opt-outs , for whatever reason . 
  denmark also has one for euro membership . 
  our opt-outs ca n't be removed without our permission , as treaty changes are subject to a veto - which is how we got them in the first place . 
  i 'm sure we 'd happily see our opt outs applied to everyone though , though we tend to get criticised a lot when we veto things . 
  no , only the uk , ireland and denmark have reserved the right to opt out . 
  nobody else can go against the final decision , otherwise there would be no point in having a final decision .
