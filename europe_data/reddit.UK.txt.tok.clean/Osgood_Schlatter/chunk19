  wilders is the link - he heads a party in the netherlands with ~ ~ over a quarter ~ ~ a tenth of the seats in their lower house of parliament . 
  hey - our buffoons go all over the place , not just to latvia . 
  in the uk we had a genetics project that looked at people whose grandparents were all from the local area . 
  they managed to find distinct genetic boundaries , sometimes along county lines . 
  movement must have been very uncommon in the past for those to exist so clearly . 
   that depends on how you define `` we '' , yes - that is only important question - who is `` we '' ? 
  that 's the `` demos '' in democracy - and the german constitutional court ruled it was the nation , not the eu  [ the existence of the patterns of identification is inevitably a matter of self-perception and degree , but their subjective absence in the minds of the governed means that there is no demos and thus no viable political culture . 
  their large-scale absence at the level of the eu , the fcc concludes , means there is ( as yet ) no ` unified european people ' . 
  for this reason the european parliament can not claim the ` democratic legitimisation ' enjoyed by national representative institutions . 
  the european parliament can not be regarded as a fully democratic legislature because it does not represent the will of a single european people .

  that 's because that happened in [ north america ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_america#/media/file:location_north_america.svg ) . 
  [ here 's a list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_conflicts_in_south_america ) . 
  in wwii there was the ecuadorian-peruvian war , and since then there has only been the cenepa war ( ecuador-peru again ) , in early 1995 . 
  there have been several internal conflicts too , and an intercontinental war , but we were talking intracontinental international wars . 
   a european army would show the world that there will never again be war between its member states . 
  well , an international war . 
  there could still be a civil war . 
  i do n't think we need to have one army in order to achieve peace though - south america has only had one war since wwii , and that lasted for about a month . 
   anarchists do n't recognise borders or nations or countries ... as legitimate ? 
  surely they know what these things are , even if they disagree with them . 
  i think he was saying there were very few muslims in eastern europe . 
  there are the old politicians , the old celebrities , the current primarily pakistani/muslim gangs and the occasional primarily white online group . 
  how would your logic handle the sudeten germans from what is now the czech republic ? 
  is n't modern germany the only successor state to nazi germany ? 
  i think that is how these things work . 
  that would be good , if it was built and not being used for a busy commercial port . 
   well if there 's no problem , you wo n't mind putting it near london then . 
  where ? 
  there is no deep sea port . 
  if they did nuke the uk , glasgow would be one of the top targets anyway . 
   i genuinely believe that if they were not exclusive to scotland and were not in favour of independence that they would likely be a popular party across the north of england . 
  yes , so do i - but that party would not be the snp . 
  [ the snp has two aims ] ( http://www.snp.org/sites/default/files/assets/documents/constitutionofthescottishnationalparty.pdf ) - the first is `` independence for scotland '' , the second is `` the furtherance of all scottish interests '' . 
  social democracy is just the means currently being used to achieve those aims . 
  if you truly want to enact social democracy , you do n't limit yourself to running in 9 % of the seats . 
  and the scottish vote is ~ 8 % of the uk vote . 
  scotland voted for the uk parliament to set defence policy , so the uk vote is the one that matters on this issue . 
  much as england having a conservative majority does n't mean the conservatives get to set westminster laws for england , scotland having a snp majority does n't mean the snp get to set westminster laws for scotland . 
  you 've done it again - defence is a uk issue , not a devolved one . 
  the snp are polling 4 % , not 54 % . 
  there was a vote on this , and the people of scotland voted to leave defence policy to westminster , and westminster supports trident . 
  having something as a policy does n't mean all your members support it , either . 
  i was thinking of the congestion - you do n't want submarines operating on the busy , always visible and shallow thames . 
  as a side point , you do know that even in the next to impossible worse case scenario , the nukes would not damage somewhere 30 miles away ? 
  that would require a total blast area of 2827.43 square miles , which is ridiculous . 
  the chernobyl exclusion zone is less than half of that , and that is massively worse than any potential incident with trident . 
  the furthest distance of any damage ( broken glass ) in nagasaki or hiroshima was about 12 miles , and those bombs were airborne and targeted to cause maximum damage . 
   you want them ? 
  you have them . 
  we do want them , so we will have them . 
  `` we '' being the citizens of the uk . 
  i assume you 're being facetious , but the answer is that the thames is congested , in a densely populated area (  5,000 people per km2 ) , bridged and shallow ( 1.8 m at london bridge ) , whilst gare loch is not ( up to 45m depth , 13 people per km2 ) . 
  the snp is about independence , it is the only policy mentioned in its constitution . 
  you must be able to see why the rest of the uk is suspicious of its intentions . 
  i think you are right - though wales was effectively dissolved in 1746 , only to return in 1967 . 
  no , it is giving the snp far too much power . 
  the snp is not scotland , despite their rhetoric . 
  there has been a trade off here - slightly fewer rights and pay was stagnant until recently , but record rates of employment . 
  it 's not ideal , but probably better than the alternative . 
  i do n't , as parliament will not want to give up its sovereignty , meaning any constitution could just be repealed by a later government . 
  i was talking about ttip - which i think the 28 eu members , the us and the eu parliament need to approve . 
  is donating blood a right that can be infringed ? 
  that seems to be an odd way of looking at it . 
  i was n't talking about race , but [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_london#ethnicity ) is the data you are looking for . 
  london went from 60 % to 45 % white british from 2001 to 2011 . 
  you 're not wrong , but i was talking about the official regions - the nine nuts1 ones that group cornwall and bristol , carlisle and liverpool and so on . 
  the regions people identify with are too numerous and irregular to be comparable to scotland . 
  most people who live there [ do not identify as english ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-ethnicity.html#tab-geographic-distribution-for-national-identity - ) . 
  the rest of the country has over 70 % of the population identify as english . 
  the deal needs to be all or nothing . 
  you ca n't pass a complex treaty if thirty parliaments are simultaneously trying to propose amendments to it . 
  i do n't think dismembering england into the regions would be popular . 
  england has an identity , but the regions do not . 
  you may agree with the principle it but want to be able to opt out for privacy reasons , or agree with it but want the regulations to be set at a national level . 
  fearful is much stronger than angsty . 
  `` tom was fearful of the threat of nuclear war '' `` tom was angtsy about asking lucy on a date '', 
  mashed up words like that are my favourite . 
  the meaning of words like pyjamify , rendezvoused or apartheidesque are clear even if you 've never heard anyone use them before . 
  nah , venezuelan petrol is worth the same as any other petrol - that 's why so much of it gets smuggled across the borders . 
  all newspapers have their own way of spinning things . 
  the guardian by and large likes the eu and green things and dislikes business and fossil fuels . 
   that has n't been the case so far . 
  that 's because we had n't passed the [ referendum lock ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/01/miliband-promises-keep-camerons-eu-referendum-lock ) , which both major parties now support . 
  that 's not a contradiction - we 'd deal with the democratic deficit by removing the powers that we think should have democratic oversight and return them to member states . 
  any more powers going to brussels triggers a referendum in the uk . 
  on a side note , there is no emerging european conciousness in the uk - you could ask someone in the street about their mep , to name an eu party , or to talk about martin shulz and they would n't have a clue . 
  did n't france , ireland and the netherlands all reject the lisbon treaty in referendums ? 
  it 's first past the post , so the 45 % that voted yes can win almost every seat by falling behind the snp , whereas the no voters are split between three different parties . 
  italians are reasonably rich by global standards , the money has already trickled , as you put it . 
  africa , asia and south america are n't looking to increase their taxes to raise their people out of poverty , they are looking to build successful businesses . 
  fear of the unknown will keep us in , much as it did scotland . 
  saying that , if we ever have a vote between a federal eu and leaving entirely , i 'd imagine we 'd vote to leave by quite a wide margin . 
  we are very happy with a richer eastern eu - less immigration , more trade , stronger nato allies , a bigger share of the power for non-eurozone countries and a smaller requirement for development aid . 
  hitler is n't known for being the most accurate or impartial source , particularly when it comes to deciding which places should be german . 
  there is no coverage of macedonia , so there is n't much chance of bad publicity . 
  i can only remember two stories on macedonia ever - the first is that greece hates your name , and the second is that you like putting up big statues of alexander the great . 
  i 'd say europe is the peninsula - and associated islands - between the white sea and the black sea . 
  looks like they are mostly from the epp , which is the same party as your government . 
  maybe that plays a role ?
