  the rest appear to either be geographically close , or language families . 
  yes , it was . 
  lots of areas are already largely excluded from the single market , such as energy to accommodate french state ownership , and much of the service industry that the uk excels in . 
  nothing is n't up for grabs if you press hard enough . 
  if a new government can not be formed with the old parliament , then that is what tends to happen in many countries . 
  i agree with all of that , but there are still have many cards that can be played . 
  the uk could , for instance , veto further eu expansion . 
  that would play well at home for limiting immigration , whilst being fairly devastating to the eu . 
  if the eu ever wants a new treaty , or to expand , or to change tax laws it will need our agreement . 
  it is n't impossible that there can be a deal of some sorts . 
   a single market without political links is inherently impossible . 
  i guess [ turkey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_customs_union ) does n't exist then . 
  nobody is proposing keeping open borders with italy but not romania - it would be the same system for everyone that is n't a british ( or irish , due to northern ireland ) citizen . 
  too late for that . 
  we already have an eu-light relationship - no euro , no budget control from brussels , no schengen zone . 
  to say we ca n't get opt outs on key areas is nonsense when we already have lots of them . 
  as long as we wield vetoes on important areas we will be able to get more opt-outs if we push hard enough for them . 
  the same universe where we have already received [ five ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#table ) significant opt-outs ? 
  you say that like we do n't already have lots of major opt-outs . 
  we do n't use the euro , we are n't in the schengen zone and the eu does n't get to control our deficit . 
  that source also shows that most people ( 51 % ) want to end the political links with europe . 
  with regards to the eu , 14 % want more , 29 % the same , 34 % less and 17 % none . 
  it seems unfair to say the current government knew what they were getting themselves in for when they may not have agreed to these rules in the first place . 
  my first point was basically that if labour sign up to something at an eu level , the conservatives can not get the uk out when they are next in government . 
  if the conservatives opt out of something at an eu level , labour can sign us up to it when they next win . 
  one issue is that when one party sign us up to more europe , it seems all following governments are bound by their decisions forever - but that is not true in the opposite direction . 
  what you want and what you expect are rarely the same thing . 
  we do n't run gmt all year as it is . 
  of course the guardian has an agenda . 
  it may be different to that of other newspapers , but it still has one . 
  not necessarily wrong , part of it is a back-dated change in how the values are calculated ( such as inclusion of illegal activities ) . 
  everyone wants benefits but not drawbacks . 
  we 're not unique in that regard . 
  the euro does not affect protectionism - the eu 's single market is a separate thing to the single currency . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01630/coming-out-of-wrec_1630933i.jpg ) you go - this is from the aeroplane crash he was in . 
  surely turkey 's deal is more comprehensive ? 
  they are part of the eu customs union . 
  could inflation play a part in that ? 
  it is ~ 0.3 % now , but was ~ 2.5 % in 2005 . 
  i 'd imagine you would be more satisfied with the euro if you thought the alternative might be the rouble . 
  not from criminal acts . 
  they can commit civil crimes though , like slander . 
  it gives them freedom of speech in parliament , according to [ their website ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/parliamentary-privilege/ ) . 
  as the press are allowed to report what is said in parliament , if a judge injuncts publishing information about something then an mp can make that ruling worthless . 
  ethnic divide , foreign occupation , economic ruin and insurgency are clearly nothing compared to ukip winning half a dozen seats . 
  austerity is done to fix the budget deficit , not help growth . 
  better to inflict limited austerity of your own choice than have the imf do it for you when you go bust and need a bailout . 
  the subdivisions themselves are quite interesting . 
  italy is fairly weird , as is the region-within-region next to crimea . 
  i do n't know about france , but our defence budget is shrinking . 
  isis and russia may help prevent that though . 
  it 's by no means unique to russia , but they do seem particularly good at it . 
  of course , it is not like latvians were ever [ targeted by the ussr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/june_deportation ) . 
  not [ ever ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_priboi ) . 
  argentina invaded the falklands largely * because * it could barely keep itself running , and our own troubles were probably partially responsible for us fighting to take them back . 
  what better to unite the population than an external enemy ? 
  i agree , but there already seems to be some sort of [ eu drug policy ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/anti-drugs/index_en.htm ) . 
  it might need tweaking to allow members of the eu to legalise if they want to . 
  not really a fair metric to use - you do n't control how many people claim refuge in your country . 
  as a country that will be accused of not doing enough , i 'd like to point out that we do give a [ lot of aid ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10570726/syria-crisis-how-does-britains-aid-donation-compare.html ) . 
  it is still a negative in this case , but would only be used in very informal spoken english . 
  you can see it used a lot in [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj3dio8pdjs#t=30 ) pink floyd song . 
  in some cases , putting emphasis on the `` no '' or the `` need '' may make it a qualified positive - `` we do n't need * no * education '' could be equivalent to `` we need less education , but not none '', 
  the gross figures given in the article have us at $ 3405 ( # 2688 ) . 
  that 's above the values it gives for sweden , finland , ireland , france or germany . 
  you should let ukraine and georgia know . 
  not for eu citizens . 
  they incorporated it as an integral part of france , rather than an overseas dependency . 
  you would probably be occupied for a short period as there is no realistic way of defending that terrain . 
  hopefully a nato counterforce would then evict russia back to its borders . 
  baltic citizens would be welcome in all other eu member states . 
  it would n't be fine either before or after this act . 
  the roi for armies may be very low , but it wo n't be 0 % . 
  not getting invaded is quite valuable . 
  it 's not because of his birthplace , it is because he has a very close relationship with a citizen from a non-allied country . 
  [ ukip to lose funding worth # 1m as farage 's european group collapses ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/16/ukip-efdd-group-collapse-brussels ), 
  what size would you prefer - i 'm guessing ~ [ 6 million ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=population+of+denmark ) people or so ? 
  anything bigger or smaller would clearly be untenable in a democracy . 
  claiming the usa was founded on the principles of tolerance and equality regardless of ethnicity is a bit of an exaggeration , given that the founding fathers owned black people as property . 
  in fairness , it 's not like they have many sources of information outside of those controlled by the kremlin . 
  i do n't think funding should be dependent on agreeing with meps from an arbitrary number of other countries . 
  cutting funding to meps seems a bit undemocratic - they still represent their constituents , no matter whether they are in an eu party or not . 
  it 's how you describe yourself . 
  70 % of people in england say they are english , 30 % say they are british and 10 % pick another identity ( you can pick more than one ) . 
  in london , 45 % say they are english , 40 % say british and 25 % pick another . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_290558.pdf ) the census pdf , it 's on page 11 . 
  in northern ireland it would be - the nationalists ( pro-dublin ) and unionists ( pro-london ) have adopted support of palestine and israel respectively . 
  in terms of where they physically came from , they are probably nearly all english . 
  of the 2.79 million uk muslims , 2.66 million come from england . 
  in terms of identity , most will be british rather than english . 
  english identity is a majority in england , but a minority in the cities where most muslims live . 
  maybe the economic difficulty seen at the end of the ussr has been attributed to democracy . 
  the ussr 's reputation is better than it should be , whilst democracy 's is worse , and that might explain it . 
  the relevant police area is 70.1 % white , and lower in the cities which is where this stuff seems to happen , so it is unclear whether that is true . 
  the media often use `` asian '' or `` south asian '' to refer to the former british india . 
  we liked it so much we made our own - the only way is essex ( se england ) , mersey shore ( nw england ) , the valleys ( s wales ) , made in chelsea ( london ) and so on . 
  no more smug condescension from us on that count !, 
  surely it is both ? 
  they may be roma but that does n't mean they are not romanian too . 
  is there currently a big issue with starvation in the balkans ?
