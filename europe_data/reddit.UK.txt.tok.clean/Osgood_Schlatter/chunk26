  if you want a federal eu then you should want us out - we are undecided about the current eu , let alone a more integrated one . 
  no , it is much more widespread than just the bbc - here 's sky doing the same : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmbwcbyt0di, 
  is n't that just for new infrastructure ( `` transport projects '' ) ? 
  i 'd imagine some of that can be explained by a combination of population growth ( [ ne lowest , london highest ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/region-and-country-profiles/population-and-migration---2013/population-and-migration---north-east.html ) ) and [ population density ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/united-kingdom/quick-facts/england/population-density#chart ) ( as before , but with london 17x higher than ne ) . 
  i 'm sure the ne could do with more , but it is always going to get significantly less per head when it is the most rural and has the least new demand . 
  there 's a limit to what makes sense to build when your [ biggest city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_east_england ) is smaller than [ croydon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_borough_of_croydon ) . 
   unionist repression against christians in n.ireland * catholics, 
  i think they run a similar deficit to the uk as a whole , though i 've not seen numbers since the oil price collapsed . 
  43 % born abroad or parents born abroad , to be precise . 
  how did you work that one out ? 
  london is the top net contributor of all uk nuts1 regions . 
  if you want to blame somewhere for being a drain , try northern ireland , north east england or wales . 
  the irish republicans got [ the good friday agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_friday_agreement ) , [ basques got money and autonomy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_nationalism#political_violence_and_devolved_autonomy ) , [ muslims got the bbc to stop showing images of muhammed ] ( http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2015/01/bbc-restrictions-on-depicting-mohammed-must-be-abolished-says-nss1 ) . 
  would n't that logic mean that asia , africa , south america and so on are not continents ? 
  this is refugees ; the number of asylum seekers would therefore be higher , the number of registered migrants higher still and the total number of migrants higher than that . 
   well it does . 
  i know it does - the 7.5 million + extra people are n't living in shoe boxes - but i 've taken to hedging my comments so they do n't disappear . 
  all polls have shown a swing to leave since the first news about the renegotiations came out , with phone polls showing a shrinking lead for remain and internet ones a growing lead for leave . 
  more bad news might swing them even further . 
  the bookies [ still predict we will stay ] ( http://www.oddschecker.com/politics/british-politics/eu-referendum/referendum-on-eu-membership-result ) , with a # 1 bet winning # 1.48 for a stay and # 3.06 for a leave . 
  this is part of the reason why immigration is such a big issue in the uk - people think it drives up prices by increasing demand for housing . 
   that they still have all the rights of refugees in country c. i do n't agree ; if b is safe then they are entering c illegally and should be deported back to b. 
  i 'm not taking a side in this case , just wanting more clarity in general . 
  both sides are continuously getting the terms wrong . 
  if there is a war in state a , state b has to let people from a in . 
  if state b is safe , state c does not have to let in people from state a who pass through state b. 
  of course people from a are refugees regardless of where they are , but that does n't mean they have free movement across the entire planet . 
  c can reject them if they come from b. 
  what does that even mean ? 
  there are plenty of small , wealthy countries and big but poor ones . 
   there 's nothing to support that in any text . 
  what do you think the words i quoted above mean then ? 
   the prosecutor seems to refer to `` people not born in germany , who have arrived in germany claiming refugee status that is the definition of asylum seeker , if anyone is interested . 
  the media need to get better at using the terms `` refugee '' `` migrant '' and `` asylum seeker '' correctly . 
  migrants are anyone who moves country ( which includes refugees ) , asylum seekers are migrants who claim to be refugees , and refugees are asylum seekers who have been been granted refugee status . 
  they would be eligible for indefinite transfers of money , and there would be an influx of migrants to western europe , which would be unpopular here . 
  i think the argument is you stop being a legitimate refugee when you have reached a safe territory , such as turkey . 
   [ the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened ** in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
   all catalonians are citizens of the eu , they should n't be stripped of that by actions of a level in between them and the eu . 
  all who were alive pre-split would remain spanish citizens , thus keeping `` eu citizenship '' . 
  nobody would be stripped of eu citizenship because nobody would be stripped of spanish citizenship . 
  that 's at least how it would work in an independent scotland . 
  i 'm sure the fact they would be eligible to get lots of money for an indefinite period has nothing to do with it . 
  turkey has jobs , greece has a moat . 
  there are good reasons not to take the risk . 
  not really - we had a tiny population compared to france until the industrial revolution . 
  in 1500 [ we had 2 million people ] ( http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/british.htm ) , whilst france had [ 15 million ] ( http://www.worldmapper.org/posters/worldmapper_map8_ver5.pdf ) . 
  `` gypsy '' may be their ethnicity , but `` bulgarian '' is their nationality . 
  if greece becomes a dead end , will people still be willing to risk their lives to get there from turkey ? 
  i doubt it .

   your search - ** orwell ** - did not match any documents . 
   suggestions :  make sure that all words are spelled correctly . 
  try different keywords . 
  try more general keywords . 
  try fewer keywords . 
  this map must be out of date - inner london is n't even 50 % white , let alone 50 % blonde . 
  i 'm saying they are leaving turkey , but not because they are desperate - much as there is no reason to be desperate to leave france , yet people still drown trying to get to the uk . 
   i think you 're underestimating desperation , there people are not picking their summer holiday destination , they 're already risking drowning . 
  they might be desperate to leave syria , but turkey ? 
  it makes more sense to compare the eu of 2016 to non-eu countries of 2016 rather than non-eu countries of the past . 
  new zealand is n't exactly a hell-hole . 
  if all else was equal then eventually that would be the case . 
  economic growth does tend to stabilise the population and reduce religiosity though . 
  religious leaders are almost always very keen on their followers having as many children as possible , as that is how they increase the influence of their religion . 
  religions that do n't push fertility are generally outcompeted by those that do . 
  being negative about the usa is a safe opinion to have - you virtue signal about how bad us healthcare/prisons/gun problems/obesity are , but you are n't going to be called racist for doing so . 
  in / r/europe you have hard right nationalists who do n't like the strong influence of a foreign culture , and hard left european federalists who want to use a caricature of the usa as something we need to join together to resist . 
   i know , you 're the norm in europe i do n't think so - reddit is rarely representative of the real population . 
  it 's usually either hard left or hard right . 
  both of those are often anti-usa , whereas in europe most people are moderate and are not anti-american . 
   and economic growth !, 
  how 's it possible if all our money goes to the refugees . 
  breaking windows and them fixing them would increase gdp . 
  you could say the same about trust , relations , ae , rivals , warscore and so on . 
  humans can mostly ignore them , but the ai does n't . 
  ld still affects tariffs , though . 
  if the game mechanics allow it , it should be allowed . 
  otherwise it would just be an arbitrary rule to help out nations with colonies they want to keep under their heel . 
   personally , i would support a rule where if you are below 50 % ld you should n't be acting directly hostile to your liege at the very least . 
  are you proposing players would have to follow what the ai would do for every situation , or just that one ? 
  they are n't necessarily anti-eu voices , they are just against - say - migrants being sent to slovakia from italy or germany making transfers to greece . 
   how many of the 32 countries that participate in eu freedom of movement for workers have complained about paying benefits to eu workers ? 
   more than one ? 
  he 's only pushing it because his real aim ( to cut eu migration ) was blocked , and this is the next best thing he could find . 
  i think the issue is that they do vote , but they do n't answer polls . 
  according to media reports on why the polls were wrong for 2015 , young left wing activists are the opposite . 
  other countries with similar concerns - such as northern europe not wanting to make huge fiscal transfers to southern europe to stabilise the eurozone . 
  no , that is the minimum wage at which you are ( on average ) not a net cost to the government . 
  for very high value things ( like the colour ink in my printer ) i guess transport is a relatively small part of the overall cost . 
  ni unionists would n't have that - too much like border controls between northern ireland and the uk but not with ireland . 
  ireland would still have free movement with the rest of the eu ; if we had open borders with ireland it could be tricky to keep everyone else out . 
  high demand occupations are exempt . 
  personally , i 'd always pick being a switzerland over a vietnam or east african community , even if the latter had more geopolitical significance . 
  that 's a good argument against irish independence from the uk , or in favour of canada being annexed by the usa . 
  bigger does n't always mean better . 
  presumably `` here '' referred to finland , not / r/europe, 
  in the west we generally say you ca n't consent to sex as a child , so anyone who has sex with a child would therefore be a rapist . 
  it is a british expression , i doubt someone from elsewhere would use it .
