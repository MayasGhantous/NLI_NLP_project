  if there is no evidence for something then i do not believe in it . 
  i was asking how your example worked . 
  cultural diversity might increase economic growth , but without seeing evidence either way i am going to assume it has no effect . 
   cultural diversity can certainly have a positive effect on economic growth , especially because a lot of people moving to london are already well off . 
  would n't that be economic growth increasing cultural diversity , rather than the other way around ? 
  some parliaments do have that degree of power though :  many states have sovereign legislatures , including the united kingdom , [ 1 ] finland , [ 2 ] the netherlands , [ 2 ] new zealand , [ 2 ] sweden , [ 2 ] barbados , jamaica , papua new guinea and the solomon islands . 
  for the uk at least , this is defined as :  the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy may be summarized in three points :  - parliament can make laws concerning anything . 
   - no parliament can bind a future parliament ( that is , it can not pass a law that can not be changed or reversed by a future parliament ) . 
   - a valid act of parliament can not be questioned by the court . 
  parliament is the supreme lawmaker . 
  i asked of the benefits of accepting refugees , not the benefits of being in the eu as a whole . 
   if you let terror control your actions or determine your politics , the terrorists actually win . 
  islamic state only `` wins '' if they establish a successful caliphate . 
  extremist muslims are not giving their lives with the aim of implementing passport controls on the oresund bridge . 
  what benefits are bundled with this downside other than good relations with germany ? 
  i do n't actually believe germany and france have done any stuff that is bad for them - the negatives they have accepted have always been part of packages with benefits that outweigh them . 
  that flag is actually the flag of the council of europe , of which all european countries ( bar belarus ) are members . 
  why is hungary in the epp and not the ecr ? 
  their '' [ soft euroscepticism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fidesz ) '' and '' [ national conservatism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fidesz ) '' seem to be more in line with the latter than the former . 
  i '' d imagine nato 's intervention would be the cause of that . 
  it 's almost as if countries are in favour of things that are good for them , and oppose things that are not . 
  polling showed a very big chunk of the population would base their vote on how it affected their income - which makes the oil money quite an important issue . 
   [ almost two-thirds of scots would vote for independence if they were guaranteed to be just # 500 better off a year , a survey has claimed . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16024399 )  [ however , the scottish social attitudes survey said only 21 % would vote for it if they would be # 500 worse off ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16024399 ), 
  the polls usually have a small lead for remaining , but some have a majority favouring us leaving . 
  one asked how people would vote with a significant renegotiation , a minor one or no changes - there was a big lead for remaining with the first , a tie with the second and a big lead for leaving with the third . 
   scottish and english football teams are separate . 
  that means nothing - there 's even an english team in the scottish league . 
  it allowed them to dig twice as quickly , and roughly halved the maximum distance to the surface/air during the dig ? 
   the near deification of cromwell in england for example we never even learnt about him in school ; he 's hardly deified . 
  it 's not just a regular hung parliament ; neither of the two most likely coalitions ( left + centre left ; centre + centre right ) make up a majority either . 
  no , or we 'd have pushed to `` liberate '' the welsh speakers of patagonia . 
  which rich country electorate is currently in favour of their government significantly increasing fiscal transfers abroad ? 
  i ca n't see it happening . 
  i did n't say it had no influence , but it is ridiculous to think a newspaper with a readership of < 10 % of the population is deciding the outcome of elections . 
  they 're populist , they just say what they think their readership want to hear - which is why in 2015 they backed the snp in their scottish edition but warned against them in england and wales . 
  the sun backs who it predicts will be the winner , it does n't pick them . 
  it 's a simple issue of supply and demand - and as supply is fairly inelastic due to strict planning laws , each extra person slightly increases prices . 
  you do n't need money to qualify for housing benefit , and lots of people are living illegally in squalid conditions . 
  we do n't have hundreds of thousands of homeless migrants . 
  the 600,000 migrants a year coming here will have a bigger effect on house prices than a few hundred millionaires . 
   the responsibility of the press is to report what is accurate , not what people think is accurate . 
  the problem is your press see their role as campaigners , not as reporters :  [ an international comparison conducted by the ludwig erhard foundation also showed that german journalists see their role differently than their colleagues around the world . 
  tichy says : `` they are zealots for a cause , and they fight for something , instead of reporting on it . 
  '' ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/lying-press-germanys-misleading-media/a-18816438 ), 
  he 's probably right - polling shows a significant lead for out if cameron fails to get any changes in his renegotiations . 
   eu has its terms outlined in the core treaties , you take them , or you get out . 
  since when have the treaties been set in stone ? 
   how do brits feel about dan jarvis ? 
  nobody actually knows much about him other than that he is a soldier . 
  i do n't personally have an issue with your suggestion , i just doubt it would be allowed by the echr , and i do n't trust the effectiveness of our deportation system when the person in question refuses to say where they are from . 
  i 'm all for dealing with the problem , i just do n't believe france has an incentive to do so and do n't put much trust in our inadequate systems for getting rid of illegal immigrants . 
  you 'll get a lot of answers here , but the primary one for the general public is less immigration . 
  it 's the [ top issue in the uk by a large margin , across all age groups and for both rich and poor ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3656/economistipsos-mori-november-2015-issues-index.aspx ) . 
  if that was feasible it would have already happened . 
  are n't the euro and schengen core eu principles that have already been compromised ? 
  will we have to join them too then ? 
   an imaginary line i do n't think the line is imaginary for us - it 's called the channel !, 
  surely all of our cells are alive and have human dna ? 
  our primary opposition party seems to have decided they will only back a war if the unsc supports it , so it does still have some influence . 
  not such a good deal - there 's only one kingdom !, 
   * the * united kingdom, 
  no part of the uk would actually want to be an american state , but equally i doubt any part would want to join the eu on its own if already outside . 
  nobody wants border controls within britain , to have to use the euro , to lose the 66 % rebate , to have to adopt id cards and join schengen and so on . 
  we 'd want at least four - one each for england , northern ireland , scotland and wales . 
  why ? 
  it may be run/founded by con artists but most members certainly believe in it the same as people do with any other religion . 
  unfortunately for romanians , that is no longer their decision to make . 
  especially for the smaller member states - the number of staff would be bigger than the total military personnel of iceland , malta or luxembourg . 
  how will iceland react ? 
  the commission wants to gain the ability to unilaterally deploy up to 2,000 agents to a country which has only 200 military personnel . 
  `` germany appointed '' ? 
  only one country gave him no meps and then opposed his appointment in the european council vote , and it was n't portugal . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.treated.com/media/3480653/treated-xmas-dinner-calories-tables-nov15table9.jpg ) 's the list of what the meals they calculated those values for contain . 
  i was n't aware that prawn cocktails were a big thing here !, 
  ones you do n't lose by having a job - such as housing benefit , working tax credits , child benefits and so on . 
  our system is non-contributory so you can get them from day 1 . 
  if your salary is low enough then coming here and working actually ends up costing the government more money than they get in taxes , as the threshold for income tax is quite high ( # 10.6 k / $ 14.7 k ) . 
  possibly , though another possibility is that we would have seen countries leave rather than accept what they would otherwise have vetoed . 
  that is true , though we have massive internal transfers to help with that . 
  [ for 2006-7 ] ( http://www.isitfair.co.uk/reports/public/oe%20ukpublicfinance.pdf ) [ pdf , p13 ] , london ran a 15 % ( ~ # 20b ) surplus with the central government whilst wales ran a 35 % deficit ( ~ # 10b ) . 
  that does n't exist in the eurozone . 
  would n't that normally prompt a rise in interest rates ? 
  i would n't have thought a rate that suited italy 's 0.6 % growth would also suit one an order of magnitude higher . 
  every country does that , just on different issues . 
   also , has there been proof of ukip getting funded by russia ? 
  i do n't think it has even been seriously suggested . 
  it 's not seen as integration here either ... 
  it 's nato blocking russian expansion , not the eu . 
   what 's regarded as part of your national territory it 's not though , you dropped that claim - a referendum on the [ 19th amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nineteenth_amendment_of_the_constitution_of_ireland ) passed with 95 % of the vote in favour . 
  that is residence/contribution testing , not citizenship testing . 
  it 's illegal under eu law to use citizenship as a qualifier for benefits , it 's one of the things cameron is pushing to change . 
  you 're going to be standoffish if there is a fair chance the bad guy has a lethal ranged weapon . 
  our police by-and-large do n't have to worry about that . 
  he 's always trolling , it 's a shame it is often misinterpreted . 
   is n't it weird that your father is a celt and you are not ? 
  nobody really identifies as `` a celt '' ; it 's irish , welsh , cornish etc. 
  speaking irish is not required in order to be just as irish as anyone else . 
  the tyrannical majority , presumably . 
   have more recent polls turned sour on her ?
