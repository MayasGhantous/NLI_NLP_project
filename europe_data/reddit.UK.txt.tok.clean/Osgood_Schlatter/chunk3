  there is no balance - the eu will punish google for not removing stuff , but not for removing too much . 
  it is an bad law badly implemented . 
  the snp refuse to vote on english laws . 
  if it is very close , and the snp do well , it is not impossible that the conservatives may be able to pass english laws but not uk-wide ones . 
  i like that our jury system protected a whistle-blower on the falklands war . 
  the judge said he should be found guilty , but the jury refused to agree because they thought it was in the public interest , despite him breaking the official secrets act . 
  i 'd imagine they 'd act in a similar way against imposition of the death penalty . 
  thanks . 
  i wanted to include both sides to avoid a debate . 
  equality of opportunity is usually the goal , not equality of outcome . 
  some of labour 's losses may be due to their supporters being less motivated to vote as miliband is so awful , whilst ukip pick up voting intention from previous non-voters . 
  i think the movements in the greek stock market are an effect , rather than a cause , of the problem . 
  little to none , thankfully . 
  the employment rate of 17-64 year olds is [ 73 % ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/october-2014/statistical-bulletin.html ) . 
  this is 0.1 % below the [ record high ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/07f1e5f8-0cc7-11e4-bf1e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3gfnmyvzo ) we hit in may . 
   with fewer people available to work , those who could work were in a strong negotiating position . 
  if ukip do well , we may go through something like * this * again . 
  if ppp stands for public-private partnerships , that is not something you should be proud of copying from us . 
  they are just a dodgy accounting trick that cost lots more in the long run in order to make it look like government borrowing is going down . 
  using money printing to ( inflate away debts/steal from savers ) , spending lots of money ( to boost the economy/running a huge deficit banned in the eurozone ) , different labour laws giving us ( a flexible economy/fewer rights for workers ) that ( attracts investment/exploits the poor ) , increasing the population by ( attracting talented immigrants/exploiting foreign labour to push down wages ) . 
  for those who did n't read the article , this vote is n't binding , unfortunately . 
  no , this was modelling on fptp , but they used the [ poll results ] ( http://survation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/political-survey-12-october-mos-tables.pdf ) broken down to the regional level . 
  the poll had ukip on 32.7 % in the south of england , with the conservatives on 27.6 % , so ukip were predicted to win a lot of seats there . 
  parts of some cities , and it is not limited to bibles . 
  rising `` witchcraft '' child abuse is apparently associated with [ `` those from africa '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11146755/child-abuse-linked-to-witchcraft-on-the-increase.html ) , whilst so-called honour killings [ `` typically occur within asian and middle eastern families '' ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20090106224426/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_2.shtml ) . 
  probably linked to immigration from the non-muslim world . 
  here 's the data table if anyone wants it : http://survation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/political-survey-12-october-mos-tables.pdf, 
  an article in the [ belfast telegraph ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/ukip-surges-to-25-in-the-polls-30657004.html ) says this level may get them 128 seats - though i doubt it , given the lack of comparable gains for the lib dems despite them polling well in 2010 . 
  the use of `` heinous '' to describe an unwanted kiss suggests they are not being serious , as does the patronising suggestion that women are too weak-minded to be able to determine whether or not they have been sexually assaulted . 
  in the uk the average rate is about # 400/year , so i 'd imagine it 'd be a little more there , as the population density is lower . 
  if the aim is to save money then meters might make sense , as they discourage excess use , but the extra work to collect the bills does partly counteract that . 
  yeah , this is reddit , people are pedantic . 
  unless you are on the minimum wage , being competitive on the market just means working for less pay . 
  i wonder why that is unpopular . 
  we do n't have enough to meet our own demand . 
  the uk has its own gas but still has to buy lots off of norway . 
  it 's a voluntary scheme - i ca n't imagine those countries that have chosen not to let anyone in changing their mind now . 
  in the uk it would be political suicide , immigration is seen as a more important issue than even the economy . 
  5/6ths of ireland is not part of the uk . 
  generally people would refer to the combined islands as the [ british isles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles ) , but most irish people are n't keen on that either . 
  you underestimate the ability of people to take offence . 
  it 's not particularly bad . 
  according to wikipedia , heavy irish sea seafood consumption increases cancer risk by a rate of 1 in 18,000,000 . 
  that 's my point - she is divisive in england , but not really in scotland . 
  they seem quite united on hating her there . 
  that 's because british reddit users are not a representative cross-section of the uk . 
  in the run up to the eu election you 'd have thought the green party were going to get a majority from the talk on here , when in fact they lost votes and ended up with less than 8 % of the total . 
  yeah , we still use it . 
  not a lot , but you do hear it from time to time . 
  that she is the [ most popular ] ( http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/12/06/prime-ministers-thatcher-best-brown-worst/ ) uk prime minister we 've had for some time may help explain why there was a referendum . 
  i think an agnostic could believe there is a god but that the nature of that god is not possible to determine . 
  there is a wikipedia page about agnostics that are not atheists [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agnostic_theism ) . 
  in theory there is , at the stage where they compete for the franchise in the first place . 
  i do n't agree with what you say about values - national identity does n't exclude holding any value in particular . 
  a fascist russian who wants to imprison gay people is as russian as a communist one who goes on a gay pride parade . 
  presumably that is why they are dumb . 
  atheism can be lack of belief in god , rather than active belief there is no god . 
  at least , that is what typing `` define : atheism '' into google tells me . 
  presumably because they think latvian society is worth being a part of . 
  that 's misleading , as the argument for privatisation usually rests on the benefits of competition improving standards . 
  foreign government owned companies can fairly compete with each other and with private companies in the uk market , but the uk government owned companies can not , as their owners write the rules . 
  i think he is doubting the exact level of unemployment , not denying there is lots of it . 
  if gender and nationality are worth balancing for then why not race , age , disability , sexuality and religion ? 
  it 's a ridiculous system that practically ensures you do not get the best people for the job . 
  other than to exist after death where they get to hook up with [ 72 transparent virgins with pear-shaped breasts and appetising vaginas ] ( http://wikiislam.net/wiki/72_virgins ) ? 
  a lot more ( well over a million ) can speak it , so it is not in real danger , but it does n't seem to be used that much . 
  you are right ; it will almost entirely be due to immigration . 
  500,000 people move here a year - so more than the welsh speaking population every 18 months . 
  it was suppressed quite badly in the past . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_language#mediaviewer/file:percentage_stating_they_speak_irish_daily_outside_the_education_system_in_the_2011_census.png ) is a map of people who use it - there are about 130,000 native speakers , but a lot more who have it as a second language . 
  the angevin empire did it first ( the normans ) . 
  possibly arguable whether they were british though . 
  do you think he would admit to being the one who dropped them ? 
  russia would claim they were stolen by nazi ninjas or some other crap , and anyone in russia who said otherwise would be jailed . 
  probably due to the first and second generation immigrants , as well as more than half a million welsh speakers . 
  possibly a boost from eastern europeans as well as irish speakers . 
  it is not an unheard of argument , though it is n't used by anyone with any influence . 
  yes , though the speed of the change in russian opinion suggests they may overtake us on that count . 
  after all , we are more likely to think the eu is incompetent than homosexual nazis or whatever the russian state media is telling people now . 
  that is not an argument for germany or sweden though . 
  you did n't screw them up !, 
  no , i 'm saying those who claim to want to save everyone are lying , as they would never propose to do something that would actually stop all the deaths . 
  i 'm sure they care a bit , but they care more about being re-elected , which would not happen if they started giving out free plane tickets . 
  thanks . 
  i guess that was based off of an earlier eu law though . 
  you have n't convinced me on any of my points . 
  your link to votewatch.eu , whilst quite useful does n't give a national party breakdown , which is all that matters as they are all i can vote for . 
  the eu election ballot only offered me ukip , conservative , labour and so on . 
  there was no way of ensuring i could vote for a particular eu wide party , as national parties are free to change which eu party they belong to . 
  as the eu parliament has no ability to initiate legislation i would not agree that it has a clear government and opposition . 
  there were not any epp representatives that i could vote for in the uk . 
  they did not run where i was . 
  the eu election campaign in the uk did only focus on national issues . 
  there may have been a debate between those people , but like over 90 % of people here i did not see it . 
  as only [ 1.1 % ] ( http://www.aecr.eu/media/aecramr-european-election-poll.pdf ) of people here could name either candidate , i do not think that i was particularly ill-informed . 
  being able to name an eu party alone puts me in the top 10 % of the eu electorate in that regard . 
  enlighten me then . 
  it 'd have to be very different to that to be useful here , as i ca n't vote for individuals nor eu parties . 
  neither does there appear to be a government or opposition to neatly divide the parliament into , and i ca n't vote for national representatives of the biggest eu party either . 
  the eu election campaigning is all on national level issues too , so i do n't know how many people would use such a site if it did exist .
