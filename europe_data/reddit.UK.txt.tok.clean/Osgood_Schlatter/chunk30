  [ it appears that way ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/11/23/after-10-years-germans-unsure-merkel-future/ ) - a poll asking whether she was likely or unlikely to be chancellor after the next election has moved from +23 in march to -6 in november ; another asking if voters would approve of another 10 years of merkel has gone from -3 to -29 . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/lying-press-germanys-misleading-media/a-18816438 ) is an interesting article from dw suggesting they have a point , though the wilder accusations are not true . 
  part of the problem is that many german journalists are `` zealots for a cause , and they fight for something , instead of reporting on it '' . 
  i know it is obvious , but the economist always avoids actually saying it despite often pointing out that the wide variety of different european approaches have all failed somewhat . 
  yes , though in this and similar articles it does seem to suggest yet avoid stating one possible additional conclusion . 
  it has previously gone into length describing three very different national approaches to handling the issue ( french la\u00efcit\u00e9 , british multiculturalism and german gastarbeiter ) and concluded they have all failed somewhat , yet it is never suggested that the problem does not lie solely on the side of the country . 
  in germany there seems to be a strong policy of defending the state from internal subversion ; until islamism was on the radar i do n't think that was seen as much of a risk in britain . 
   tl ; dr : bashing belgium is hypocritical as the entire continent is facing the same issues . 
  that is an inaccurate summary - we do not see this problem in countries such as poland , portugal , slovenia or lithuania . 
  the article says `` no european country with a large muslim minority has solved the problem of integration '' , not `` no european country ~ ~ with a large muslim minority ~ ~ has solved the problem of integration '' . 
  toppling the saudi government would probably lead to more bombs , not fewer . 
  they may be awful but they are n't as bad as the alternative . 
  i do n't think we covered anything like that in england - the closest was pshe ( personal social health education ) . 
  the new citizenship lessons might cover it though , but they are quite a new thing . 
  not when i was at school ( am in my early 20s now ) ; the conservatives did introduce citizenship recently so that might cover it now . 
  as far as i can recall how the uk works is n't taught either , so at least it is a level playing field on that front . 
  i do n't recall it ever being mentioned at school , and am in my early 20s . 
  you joke , but that was basically the procedure to ensure your claim was accepted - people were providing video footage of homosexual sex acts . 
   in a decision that may force the home office to tighten up its interview rules , the court ruled that immigration officials must not accept explicit photographs or videos submitted by asylum seekers to prove their sexuality . 
  you do n't have to prove it any more , the echr ruled that was illegal . 
   [ gay and lesbian asylum seekers must not be asked to prove they are homosexual in order to stay in britain , following a judgement by a european court yesterday . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11269313/european-court-asking-asylum-seekers-to-prove-sexuality-is-breach-of-human-rights.html )  [ asking refugees detailed questions about their sexual habits in order to establish whether they are at risk of persecution at home is a breach of their fundamental human right to a private life , the european court of justice ruled . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11269313/european-court-asking-asylum-seekers-to-prove-sexuality-is-breach-of-human-rights.html ), 
  you would n't need to tell your story to people in europe other than officials dealing with asylum . 
  that is n't true - just convince them you are gay or a convert from islam and you 're good , as all three imprison people for homosexuality and apostasy . 
  public support is [ strongly in favour ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/11/25/strong-and-continued-support-raf-air-strikes-syria/ ) , the government are in favour and [ the majority of labour is too ] ( http://www.itv.com/news/2015-11-26/syria-airstrikes-labours-senior-ranks-in-chaos-as-jeremy-corbyn-fights-against-his-shadow-cabinet/ ) , bar their leader . 
  i think it is likely we 'll be there soon . 
  i 'm fairly sure nobody flies directly over russia itself . 
  it 's a bizarre and ridiculous law - look at [ all these bbc news articles that have been hidden ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/1d765aa8-600b-4f32-b110-d02fbf7fd379 ) . 
  they are n't inaccurate , [ just inconvenient ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28130581 ) , so now nobody is allowed to find them any more . 
  it 's not helping anyone , as if you want accurate information [ there are lots of ways to still get it ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/07/03/bypass-right-to-be-forgotten_n_5553926.html ) . 
  they generally do n't fly into our exclusive airspace , they skirt very closely around it . 
  we know nato works by the fact that the fan is still clean . 
  a border dispute prevents a country joining nato , and being in nato lets you ignore russian bullying as they can no longer credibly threaten to invade you . 
  you are right , but occasionally `` x national '' implies something less than being `` x-ian '' . 
  the media seem to sometimes use it for people who were not citizens of x at birth , or who are not of x 's majority ethnicity ( to explain why their name does n't sound right for country x ) . 
  i do n't think it 's something they 'd admit to doing though . 
  i guess puerto rico is ahead of us in the queue . 
  if it was just a man he would be fine , i think the concern was with the accompanying 38 tonne war plane that can carry [ air-to-surface missiles , a cannon , air-to-air missiles , various bombs and an unguided rocket launcher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_su-24#specifications_.28su-24mk.29 ) . 
  not a school shooting - though the fact that there have only been two mass shootings in any context in 25 years is still pretty impressive . 
  everyone evolved , some groups just went in slightly different directions . 
  the murder rate in the netherlands is 0.9 / 100,000 versus 3.8 / 100,000 in the usa , so if anything you will be safer there than at home . 
  a minor error - the graphs show 2 of our 72 meps being in favour , but [ the pdf ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2fnonsgml%2bpv%2b20151111%2bres-rcv%2bdoc%2bpdf%2bv0%2f%2fen&amp;language=en ) lists a correction , meaning one of those votes was actually against . 
  i liked [ cordon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cordon_ ( tv_series \\ ) ) , a flemish drama about a deadly disease spreading through a quarantined antwerp , and [ jordskott ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jordskott ) , a supernatural swedish crime drama . 
  it is worrying having `` boots on the ground '' to fight islamists can now be a domestic decision rather than just a foreign policy one . 
  you are right , that could be an issue . 
  what 's with the purposeful misinterpretation ? 
  there have been no mass-shootings in a school * anywhere * in britain since 1996 , and only one outside of a school in the meantime . 
   gun laws get tighter , without ever being able to prevent said tragedy from happening we tightened our gun laws in 1996 after the dunblane school shootings , and there has not been another one since ... 
  no , as pensions are contributory ; you need 30 qualifying years to get a full state pension . 
  it is a choice , just not a concious one - though i guess you could go down the deterministic route and argue that nothing is a choice , just an inevitable result of the laws of physics . 
  you might be born into a religion , but you still choose whether or not to follow it , especially so as an adult . 
  france and the netherlands shot down the last treaty , i doubt they 'd be any more in favour now . 
  you do n't choose to be irish , and there are no beliefs associated with it so there was no reason for them to apologise/protest . 
  unless they make it illegal to be a radical islamist i 'm not sure what more they can really do . 
   nato has never done anything aggressive towards russia in the last 25 years around his borders , yeah ? 
  not really - of the 14 other post-soviet states , three have been partly occupied by russian troops but none by nato member states . 
  basically . 
   [ mg204 communities and regions should have the right to restrict inward migration when one or more of the following conditions are satisfied  ( https://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html ) [ ... ]  [ c ) ** the prospective migrants have , on average , equal or greater economic power than the residents of the recipient area ** and they or their families were not forced to leave the area in the recent past . 
  ] ( https://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html ), 
  he has met them , defended them , gone to rallies with them and so on . 
  this article from a newspaper that is generally sympathetic to him covers some of it : http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/13/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-foreign-policy-antisemitism, 
  a permanent state of high alert seems to be the best we can hope for now - we 've not been below `` substantial '' for islamist ( `` international '' ) terrorism since the system was implemented almost a decade ago . 
  the plan does include a provision that restricts open borders for rich people , so that might help cripple trade . 
  the green party are actually far left when you read their manifesto - open borders , an end to international trade , a majority employees * or customers * having the right to seize companies and so on . 
  they strongly oppose it , much like the rest of the uk . 
  the scottish independence campaign had to argue that the relevant treaties would n't apply if they won . 
  have a look at scots wikipedia - i find it can be helpful to read it phonetically in a scottish accent : https://sco.wikipedia.org/wiki/lion, 
  that may be because we are more interested in you than the usa , being our similar sized neighbour and all . 
  i know , that was the first part of my second sentence - or are you just providing a link for other people ? 
  british news sources tend to dominate this sub regardless of the topic - they currently make up 9 of the 21 posts on the front page that are links to articles , versus 5 from the usa in second place . 
  there is a very high population density on the german/belenux border , so if any set of countries were going to have a mini-schengen it would probably be them . 
  we already have one for the uk and ireland , maybe setting up another for v4 , one for the nordic countries , one for the baltic countries and so on might be more popular than the current system . 
  you can share information between countries other than at an eu level . 
  if france and belgium want to do that then other countries ca n't stop them . 
  german is not an ideology , so that is actually less accurate than before . 
  you ca n't be a moderate german any more than you can be a moderate left hander , a moderate ab positive blood type or a moderate arab . 
  i guess you * could * instead say a moderate german supremacist . 
  it is an ideology of which the nazis were an extreme subset , yet most of the people that believed in it never did anything particularly wrong . 
  do n't worry , just wait for some more brexit posts if/when this all dies down . 
  what do you mean ? 
  those are the actual betting odds right now . 
   many germans simply ca n't be bothered to do anymore i 'm fairly sure higher wages would make them bothered ; if not , there are plenty of unemployed people in southern eu states and low wage workers in eastern eu states . 
  bookies currently have her at 4:1 , tied with manuel valls in second place behind sarkozy at 3:1 . 
  we are affected by it anyway - once eu citizenship is granted [ a lot of people born outside of europe move to the uk ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/28/british-dream-europe-african-citizens ) . 
  the estimate in 2013 was 141,000 people . 
  i 'm saying that treaties can be changed , so just because it says something is n't possible now does n't mean that always has to be the case . 
  i think it 's probably jihad going through their heads when they launch these suicidal attacks , not any impact on western domestic policies . 
  the terrorist 's definition of `` winning '' is an islamic caliphate and lots of dead westerners , not an overly authoritarian french state . 
  in a literal sense they already are ( special forces , military advisors ) , but i still doubt any western army will be sent in . 
  i think the opinion in the uk since at least the [ 7/7 attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_july_2005_london_bombings ) ( 2006 ) is that there will always be a next attack , the only question is when it will happen and how bad it will be . 
  the [ threat level ] ( https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/the-threats/terrorism/threat-levels.html ) from `` international '' terrorism has n't fallen below `` substantial '' since it was introduced in 2006 . 
  rule avoidance is what we do and is legal , rule evasion is not and is part of what got greece into such a mess . 
  it 's fine if you do n't want to change something - just do n't shut the argument down by calling it `` sacred '' , rather than just something you think is in your own interest to keep . 
  yes , but sometimes certain people do n't seem to agree with that . 
  nothing about the eu should be considered [ `` sacred '' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/07/cameron-eu-freedom-of-movement-helsinki ) or '' [ fundamental ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/03/eu-freedom-of-movement-non-negotiable-germany ) '' and therefore not open to even the consideration of any change . 
  you are probably right , though you forget there are now as few as four ( land ) borders between paris and damascus now , not `` over a dozen '' . 
  that drops to two if you factor in travel by boat from greece to italy . 
  it is only a `` fundamental goal '' until we decide it is n't . 
  if it is possible for denmark and the uk to stay permanently outside then it must be possible for finland too .
