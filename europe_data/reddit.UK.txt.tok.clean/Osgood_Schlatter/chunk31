  you do n't need schengen for free travel ; we have the latter but not the former between the uk and ireland . 
  why would russia be one of our best allies ? 
  all they 've really done for the last century is occupy their neighbours and oppress their own population . 
  we only ended up on the same side in wwii because germany betrayed the deal they had . 
  `` infidels '' are n't a race , so treating them badly is not racist . 
  bigoted would probably be the right word for what you are trying to say . 
  might `` they '' be a reference to extremists rather than all muslims ? 
  there are thousands of people being watched as they are deemed high risk , and most will not do anything currently deemed worthy of being arrested . 
  you ca n't imprison people merely for being high risk whilst being subject to the echr - you 'd have to leave the eu and then write some very draconian laws . 
  there are huge numbers of people being monitored in france , but nothing can be done about them without evidence beyond reasonable doubt that they are planning something illegal . 
  it 's not newsworthy when it 's regular - that 's why the frequent bombs found in northern ireland are rarely covered in england , but one found in wales or scotland would be a big story . 
  making bad decisions is not illegal . 
   it 's a lot more likely that the attacks have been done by people who have live a in france for a long time , or were born there . 
  the refugee crisis seems unrelated possibly not , according to reuters :  [ syrian passport found near paris ' stadium bomber : sources ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/14/us-france-shooting-syria-passport-iduskcn0t30r520151114 ), 
  the french police say they have found a syrian passport by one of the bodies , according to reuters . 
  the article was posted here , but removed for being unverified .

  islamic state - not that anyone will ever recognise them as such . 
  we are europeans regardless of the eu . 
  i do n't think the swiss are any less sympathetic for lack of any political union . 
  he was a soldier of a country we are at war with , in practice if not in name . 
  trials are usually for civilians located in your own country . 
  there was no real possibility of a trial , so either we could try to kill him , or ignore him and allow him to decapitate some more civilians . 
  unfortunately it will most likely be more , as the some of the badly wounded die and the hostage situation unfolds . 
  things look bad - from one of the locations alone :  a bbc journalist at the cambodge restaurant says he can see 10 people on the road either dead or seriously injured .

  it 's how you might speak to colleagues at work rather than close friends or family , but i ca n't see anything i particularly disagree with . 
   just how many votes do our popularity contestants get out of throwing money at foreign people who are in trouble in foreign places ? 
  shit , they lose votes for that more than gain any . 
   humanitarian ideals are really not that popular , when they cost money . 
  it seems our conservative party disagrees - they are hacking many departmental budgets by 30 % , but foreign aid is protected at 0.7 % of gdp . 
  ironically , it might be getting downvoted solely due to you incorrectly claiming it is an unpopular opinion . 
  it 's not as far right as the bnp , jobbik or golden dawn but it is n't as mild as ukip . 
  it 's the politicians who actually wield power in the uk , so they are the ones that need to be symbolically humbled from time to time . 
  unless cameron can get something in return for agreeing to this he will have to block it to stop his mps rebelling . 
   this proposal will now be submitted to the council , which decides upon by unanimity for it to enter into force . 
  this proposal ~ ~ us ~ ~ is not going anywhere then . 
  confusingly , loanword diacritics are mostly dropped in practice , but their effect on pronunciation is mostly retained . 
  i 'm guessing there was too small a sample size, 
  raising the minimum income before you pay any income tax was a pretty big tax cut . 
  that is interesting - our net contribution was # 3b in 2008-9 , but has now reached over # 10b, 
  if the cdu ran in bavaria might the csu not run elsewhere too ? 
  as a respectable party moderately opposing the current immigration policy might they not have some success ? 
  i realise it 's mostly not significant , which is why i went with `` might '' for everything . 
  it 's more historical than anything . 
  one issue is that the facebook mobile app gives them access to your contacts ; they can piece together all of your friends if enough of them have your number and the app . 
  `` white british '' is an ethnic group on the census , but they also collect information on english , cornish , welsh and scottish identity - they do n't relate these to ethnicity , but they might be seen that way by some . 
  ** `` celtic '' ** cornish is related to welsh , but in england ; whilst scottish might be divided into the lowlands ( where they speak scots , a germanic language similar to english ) and highlands ( where they speak/spoke scottish gaelic , a celtic language related to irish ) . 
  they also have islands off the coast with a norwegian history that might be said to have a shetlander/orkney identity . 
  ** `` anglo-saxon '' ** england was settled by angles , saxons and jutes , but those distinctions only really live on in place names now . 
  kent was jutish ( from jutland , denmark ) ; essex , wessex , sussex and so on in the south were saxon ( from nw germany ) and the north , midlands and bits of se scotland were angles ( from the schleswig area of denmark/germany ) . 
  and with eu membership ... ? 
  i had n't realised the eu affected our geography such that we would otherwise sail away . 
  no , but he does lead a majority in the commons , which is what i was referring to . 
  the examples are fairly damning and wide-ranging . 
  i do n't trust eurobarometer any more , since the max planck institute for the study of societies released this paper saying they fixed the questions to favour integration . 
   [ this paper reviews eurobarometer surveys from 1995 to 2010 and shows how eurobarometer selects and frames questions in ways that systematically produce `` integrationist '' outcomes . 
  the violations of the rules of good public opinion research concern incomprehensible , hypothetical , and knowledge-inadequate questions , unbalanced response options , insinuation and leading questions , context effects , and the strategic removal of questions that led to critical responses in previous eurobarometer waves . 
  it is highly unlikely that the violations happen unintentionally . 
  eurobarometer therefore ** blurs the line between research and propaganda ** . 
  i did - they repeat the misleading headline once , then switch to what i said . 
  i assume nobody else reads the article so pointed it out . 
  it 's his support for a brexit he ca n't rule out ; he 's basically given up his right to determine whether we stay or go by agreeing to hold a referendum on the matter . 
  yes - if you ca n't beat them , join them . 
  i think we recently introduced the patent box rules too - i guess this is why . 
  could building a pipe from germany to ukraine/poland make the opposite true ? 
  i 've read the article and i 'm none the wiser as to why it matters either way , or as to how the solution makes sense - how can a region be `` autonomous '' if it has to work together with another one ? 
  the two are n't mutually exclusive - the eu just wo n't let you subsidise the former , but does let you do the latter . 
  it 's why budget airlines offer such cheap rates to take you to the middle of nowhere in france - the local governments subsidise them to go there , as it brings them in quite a lot of money from tourism . 
  you can probably subsidise airlines to encourage them to go to estonia , just not one airline in particular . 
  he was so confident the smear would work he even took it straight from an urban legend :  [ this story may or may not be true , but legend has it that during one of lyndon johnson 's congressional campaigns he decided to spread a rumor that his opponent was a pig-fucker . 
  lbj 's campaign manager said , `` lyndon , you know he does n't do that ! '', 
  johnson replied , `` i know . 
  i just want to make him deny it . 
  '' ] ( http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_09/009566.php ), 
   but it 's a pretty baseless claim by somebody who hates him the guy did n't even claim it happened ... he claimed someone told him they had a photo of it . 
  he did n't name his source or even claim to have seen the photo . 
  no , other than libyans they stopped fleeing a war before they reached the eu . 
  that 's not the question i was asking though ... 
  that point is reached before the need for any refugees , because you use regular , skilled , legal migration to hit that number . 
  i 'm asking if anyone is practising what they preach , not whether lots of people are preaching the same thing . 
  if the german government really thought the current refugee influx was a positive , merkel would n't be sucking up to erdogan to reduce the flow or trying to redistribute migrants to eastern europe . 
  are there any countries that actually agree with this conclusion , and put that into practice ? 
  it seems even those most in favour of a generous asylum policy want to reallocate the people they receive to other countries . 
   68 % of former somalian refugees are unemployed . 
  do n't worry about that , we 'll take them off of you ...  [ studies show that between one third and a half of the entire dutch somali community has moved to the uk . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/28/british-dream-europe-african-citizens ), 
  it certainly does n't read like a `` trash right-wing '' article ...  the experience of living in a society made diverse by mass immigration should be welcomed . 
   resolve to treat everyone as citizens  europe must rediscover a progressive sense of universal values ,, 
  nope - ashcroft does not claim to have seen the photo , he claims to have been told of its existence by an mp , whose name he wo n't reveal . 
  a political rival claimed he had heard a rumour that cameron had it off with a dead pig 's head . 
   i 'm assuming your counting `` northern irish '' ( which is often on census ' but is n't actually a nationality ) as british ? 
  no , i did n't count it as either - nor did i count english , scottish , welsh or `` other '' . 
  i just compared `` irish '' to `` british '' . 
  i think that is unlikely - `` other religions '' and `` no religion '' are growing the fastest , and they are both over 50 % british identity and under 15 % irish identity . 
  13 % of catholics identify as british ( 57 % as irish ) versus 4 % of protestants who identify as irish ( 82 % as british ) , and so on . 
  even a 60 % catholic , 30 % protestant and 10 % other/none population would identify more as british than as irish . 
  i think you are arguing at cross purposes - one saying that they do n't accomplish anything , the other that they can have big consequences . 
  there are consequences , but they usually are n't an accomplishment for those behind the attack .
