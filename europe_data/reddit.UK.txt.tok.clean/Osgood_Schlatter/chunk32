  no , but there are no borders in schengen to make that a reality . 
  my point is that eu law is only law and eu courts only have jurisdiction because westminster says so . 
  it 's freedom of movement between ireland and the rest of the eu and between ireland and the uk that would be the issue , not schengen ( which neither of us are a part of anyway ) . 
  any eu protection you get is solely due to westminster deciding that should be how the system works though - you ca n't say you want one to protect you from the other because that does n't make sense . 
  parliament is still sovereign , if mps wanted to do those things they could , regardless of what the eu or echr said . 
  the only thing that protects us is having mps that do n't agree with those things . 
  that 's a reasonable argument , but i do n't think it is one that applies to nw europe . 
  it 's the same pronounciation either way - [ here 's a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uee_mcxvrw#t=17 ) where they use it ( though a bit creepy , and with an afrikaans accent ) . 
  could you say it like that ? 
  i 'd thank democracy for peace , not the eu . 
  strong democracies practically never fight each other , be they in the eu or elsewhere . 
  you do realise that was a result of * not * being independent , as it happened before we got our opt-out ? 
  we already do n't vote on issues to do with refugees or the eurozone , and look how well they 've turned out !, 
  they voted against the government on the tampon tax - with a tory rebellion things like that go keep going wrong . 
  labour 's aim would be to make the government look bad , not to leave the eu . 
  have you considered just using an [ estuary accent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estuary_english ) - which would make it liffuania ? 
  eurosceptic does n't only mean people who want to leave - i 'd say most people ( and most tory mps ) do n't want more eu , even if they are worried about what might happen if we leave entirely . 
  it 's not just about the voters - cameron has a small majority in parliament , and needs to keep his mostly eurosceptic mps onside . 
  the civil war/slavery/civil rights thing might , but you 'd have to go back a fair bit . 
  if it were up to people in britain then it might happen ; the people who live there are not too keen though . 
  unification only has ~ 20 % support at the moment . 
  it 's a difference in mindset . 
  when it comes to spying , germans might think of the stasi or the gestapo ; we think of james bond , winning wwii and stopping another ira or 7/7 . 
  it will probably take a very serious negative incident that people can relate to before that changes . 
  fiddling with the electorate one way or the other is a bad idea , as it opens up the result to accusations of being illegitimate . 
  if it 's good enough for general elections it is good enough for a referendum . 
  you ca n't fight in the army or marry without your parent 's permission at 16 . 
  i think it should be tied to the age of majority - though whether that should be reduced is a separate question . 
  the answer is still technically no . 
  the amount of treatment you receive is unrelated to the tax you pay . 
  you are n't paying tax to be treated , you are paying it because the government demands it . 
  most of our turks ( 60 % ) are turkish cypriots , but they presumably do n't get a vote . 
  the kurds apparently make up about a third of our `` turkish mainland '' population , though the actual population may be several times the recorded number . 
  that 's what [ wikipedia says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_turks#demographics ) , anyway . 
  economic growth would increase even from smashing all your windows , i do n't see how refugees could do anything but increase it . 
  per capita , however , will almost definitely be a different story . 
   hospitals do n't hand out blood bags to their patients for free . 
  yes they do , assuming you are a legal resident and actually need it . 
  the guy who runs yougov is a big fan of the eu ( his wife was first vice-president 2010-14 ) , i doubt they are trying to overstate the anti-eu case if that is what concerns you . 
  someone has to have an error ( though you ca n't know who without actually having a referendum on it ) , or opinion has changed , or they are asking slightly different things . 
  they use the system for the uk too , and it is no worse than the other methods once you weight it . 
  it has the benefit in that people are more willing to admit unpopular opinions than they are when talking to a real person . 
  click the hyperlink for the questions , the people are selected through their internet site and weighted to be representative . 
  some interesting results in the [ attached polling ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/82cc6m777i/eurotrack_october_trackers_website.pdf ) : - 70 % of germans disapprove of their government , versus 19 % who approve - 37 % of swedes want to leave the eu - about 30 % of germans , french , danes and finns want to leave the eu - leave and remain are tied at 40 % in the uk - all six countries are negative about the future of the eu, 
  people always seem to see `` aliens '' when they read `` ufo '' , but the latter is just anything in the sky that you ca n't identify . 
  as it 's per capita , does anyone have an idea how much the migrant crisis has reduced germany 's numbers by this year ? 
  does the [ english flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_england#/media/file:flag_of_england.svg ) * ever * get used to represent the english language ? 
  i ca n't recall ever seeing it , though it would probably make the most sense . 
  it 's based on [ a map from 1947 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nine-dashed_line ) . 
  the extent of and justification for their claims are fairly vague and pretty dubious :  in october 2008 , the website wikileaks published a cable from the us embassy in beijing reporting that yin wenqiang , a senior chinese government maritime law expert , had `` admitted '' he was unaware of the historical basis for the nine dashes . 
   i said it vastly outnumbers all of europes forces north korea has more soldiers than russia , but that does n't mean they could occupy it . 
  i was thinking a lot would be too poor to get here even if we opened the doors . 
  it 's a decent argument , but warning that our financial sector will move away may have the opposite effect on the electorate as intended . 
  people still like bashing the banks , especially those on the mostly-pro-eu left . 
  that 's the important bit - setting the rules , not dealing with people who use them to pay the minimum . 
  `` tax optimisation '' will always be the correct course of action for everyone - nobody wants to pay more than they have to . 
  a swiss court , maybe ? 
  yes , else we 'd have to give asylum to hundreds of millions of people in africa and india . 
  as we definitely do n't want to do that , that is not the criteria for being accepted . 
  safe/suitable does n't mean rich , it means not a threat to your life . 
  you can set terms for an extradition , much as the uk did with abu qatada going to jordan . 
  you ca n't really miss india , indonesia , thailand or malaysia . 
  tl ; dr : more eu , more spending and more immigration or hitler . 
  it 's because blatter recently admitted they 'd already decided on russia before the vote took place . 
  are you comparing migrants in turkey to jews under the nazis ? 
  i think they are ( were ? ), 
  an active choice rather than a default either way . 
  i do n't think eu donations are a big thing for most countries - especially when you consider what countries have to pay in - but they are for poland . 
  i remember seeing that gets more than anyone else - it benefits a lot from both farm and development subsidies . 
  dignity is a very broad term , maybe it means something a little different in german . 
  it 's not dignified to be imprisoned for being a child molester , but that does n't mean we should n't do it . 
  that 's a lot of money - about 5 % of government spending , as your government spending is about 40 % of gdp . 
  no deportation is worth threatening the dignity of the individual ? 
  that principle would seem to be very easy to abuse . 
  this one might not be obvious enough to be recognised as a joke , but i 'd say you are generally pretty good at getting the balance just right . 
  we are spending billions on helping them , but the problem does n't seem to be with money . 
  erdogan is looking for a fight with the turkish kurds in order to win a majority in the parliament , and that appears to be a much more important reason as for why turkey is in trouble . 
  what 's the point of eu rules when they are only enforced when it suits those in power ? 
  might be a reference to '' [ honour killings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honor_killing ) '' in which parents kill children who `` shame '' the family . 
  they 're in the news quite often in the uk . 
  i guess the logic is it lets you offer lower domestic rates to help you win domestic customers who do n't consider it when buying . 
  another issue could be that running costs might be higher in some other eu countries , so charging your customers more when you are in them stops them from costing you money . 
  it will be interesting to see whether the snp will be willing to put scottish wallets where their mouth is when they [ receive the ability to create new benefits and raise income tax ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32810553 ) . 
  i do n't think you can be said to have lost an election if you can get a majority of the parliament to back your candidate . 
  of course - was talking about the uk . 
  not really . 
  as a net contributor we have to thank the eu for handing out money we gave them in the first place . 
   scottish people very marginally voted yes overall the ones living in scotland did - i 'd imagine the ones in the rest of the uk would have been against overall . 
  we do follow the rules , we just have a different idea on what they should be . 
  i think it might be called [ bk ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/mycobacterium_tuberculosis ) in french ? 
  the suspicion was unjustified , but if it had been justified that would have been the correct response . 
  they did ? 
   both children were returned to their families after dna tests proved that the fair-haired children were the offspring of their dark-haired gypsy parents, 
  government represent countries , and governments can have wishes . 
  he 's saying one in three support her , not one in three oppose her . 
  proponents of schengen and eu expansion ? 
  the law is changing to move towards shared parental leave - men used to get a lot less than women . 
  i think it was ~ 2 weeks for men and up to a year for women , though the pay would decrease in steps over time . 
  the numbers in the article this one links to suggest there is no other significant issue - 48 % see immigration as the top concern , with the next being relations with the eu at 9 % . 
  that 's the official reason , but i think a lot of the media attention was due to a lot of people getting upset at possibly having eaten an animal they see as a pet rather than as dinner .
