  they were the biggest economy in the world for most of history , even if the area in which they were interested was quite small . 
  some of those examples may suggest why spain and germany currently have similarities to each other over argentina , but i do n't think they are not the basis of a specific identity defined by being european . 
  what is so different about argentinians compared to spaniards ? 
  the language , traditions and religion are all closer to each other than either is to germany . 
  why a lot ? 
  i strongly doubt i could tell one from the other . 
  i still think a german might identify more with a canadian or uruguayan than with a chechen or moldovan . 
  not in the uk - i ca n't think of anyone who would identify more with an albanian or latvian than a new zealander or australian . 
   i do n't understand why a fiscal union was n't developed at the same time as the currency maybe they thought some people would n't want to join the latter if they knew it 'd force them into the former . 
  those questions seem like they were designed to give certain answers . 
  if they had been biased it the other way ( such as asking if people wanted their country to have less control over immigration ) there would probably have been a different response . 
  whilst our media runs footage of crying babies , our pollsters will show concern about immigration rising above its already stratospheric levels . 
  it 's probably somewhat to do with nuclear weapons , economy size and military spending now , rather than just for winning wwii . 
  the uk and ireland have freedom of movement but are not in schengen . 
  migration seems to a major factor behind london 's problem with tb . 
   [ london tuberculosis rates ` worst in western europe ' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23777685 ) [ ... ]  [ about 75 % of cases were among people born in countries where tb is more common , mostly south asia ( 60 % of cases ) and sub-saharan africa ( 22 % ) . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23777685 ), 
  there 's a scale from natural disaster to negligence to genocide , and where things fall on that scale is sometimes controversial . 
  comparing the employment rate could be quite interesting too . 
  people from the country officially known as the [ syrian arab republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syria ) are not arabs ? 
  i do n't think people from the uk should use it , but i 'm not sure whether that rule should carry over into an area not governed by the uk 's norms . 
  in the other direction , use of `` oriental '' in the uk should n't be affected by the negative connotations in the usa . 
  how are unskilled migrants meant to get jobs without allowing them to depress wages ? 
  as they are less skilled , working for less money than austrians is all they have going for them . 
  the fact this is being seen as a maximalist list here but a minimalist list in the uk does not bode well for the upcoming negotiations . 
  what do the numbers reach when you add in all sources of migrants ? 
  in support of that , [ here ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-ethnicity.html#tab-geographic-distribution-for-national-identity - ) are the census results in which english identity is a minority in london . 
  you cross your fingers and think of finland . 
  wikipedia says the best bellwether seat in the uk is dartford , which has elected an mp from the winning party in every election since 1964 . 
  the region would probably be the west midlands , though as nothing is elected on that level it 's hard to know how that has changed over time . 
   despite of all the controversy surrounding refugees and islam the vast majority of europeans are accepting of muslims . 
  given only 50 % would be comfortable with their kid being in a relationship with a muslim that does n't seem to be a vast majority . 
  why is war in europe inevitable without the eu ? 
  democracies have n't fought any major wars with each other since wwii . 
   more integration is better than being at the whim of our neighbours forever . 
  integration is forever being at the whims of your neighbours , because they will be running your country . 
   due to current politics this means that we can not have a functioning government unless a party with 13 % support dictate policy . 
  what stops the centre left and centre right going into coalition together , like in germany ? 
  thanks , that makes sense . 
  i guess the price they want is less immigration , which neither the alliance or the government is willing to give them ? 
  my `` they '' was the three biggest out donors , rather than the out campaign itself . 
  i guess if the conservatives , labour , lib dems and snp all officially backed in then the financing cap might be significantly higher for in , in which case you would be right . 
  we have reasonable campaign finance rules , the cap will be relatively low and probably be met by both sides . 
  if the sweden democrats want an alliance budget , why do n't the alliance form a minority government with their support ? 
  between them they have a clear majority . 
   article 79 of our constitution says that the tenets of the articles 1 and 20 can not be changed . 
  is there a rule preventing article 79 from being changed ? 
  they 'll be massively out-bankrolled by big banks that prefer us to remain in the eu , vetoing changes not in their interests . 
  the bbc are getting a little more balanced , only yesterday i heard a migrant asked if they cared for other syrian refugees ( no ) , why they wanted to go from bulgaria to germany ( better benefits ) , why the west should help them ( think of it as a donation ) and so on . 
  it 's not uncommon - some form of blasphemy law exists in ireland , germany , italy , france , canada , australia and new zealand too . 
  i was explaining the view of the people who use the flag , not the actual status of nagorno-karabakh . 
  the flag is the armenian flag with a bit broken off , because the people in charge of nagorno-karabakh think that describes the place in which they live . 
   but the main point on the agenda is the set of rules which aims to create a single european market for railway companies and liberalise the sector , as proposed by the commission in january 2013 . 
  it looks like those who want to nationalise our railways may end up butting heads with the eu . 
  if russia does n't want its neighbours to feel scared then it should refrain from occupying parts of them . 
  nobody wants a new south ossetia , crimea , transinistria or donbass on their territory . 
  i think it symbolises the view that the territory is a broken away part of armenia . 
  they dropped that : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-33516713, 
  if there is a controversial choice and the eu goes for the option germany backs , it is seen as being imposed by germany . 
  they should ban new religious schools from opening , then shut down any that do anything dodgy . 
   [ the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine is a world-leading centre for research and postgraduate education in public and global health . 
  ] ( http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/introducing/index.html ), 
  it is true actually , based on self-identification rather than colour/race/ethnicity / etc. 
  london is 43.7 % english versus ~ 75 % for the rest of england . 
  http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-ethnicity.html#tab-geographic-distribution-for-national-identity -, 
  it 's not arbitrary , [ the census ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-ethnicity.html#tab-geographic-distribution-for-national-identity - ) ( which had a section where you could self-identify ) also showed `` english '' identity was a minority in london , as opposed to a significant majority in the rest of england . 
  that 's partly explained by people preferring `` british '' though . 
  if the colours just show the largest group then an area that is 30 % white british , 20 % white other , 25 % black and 25 % asian would be shown as white british , making that group look larger than it is . 
  are n't they competing with the eu ? 
  syrians get asylum regardless of whether they were safe in turkey before arriving . 
  maybe you should brush more anyway . 
  the [ most recent oecd data ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=health_stat ) for slovenia says you have an average of 3.1 unhealthy teeth per person , versus 0.7 for the uk and 1.3 for the usa . 
  it will be much more than 1.5 million - that is just the number of asylum seekers . 
  germany had [ 1.47 million ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/societystate/population/migration/migration.html ) migrants last year , when asylum seeker numbers were at `` only '' 200,000 . 
  assuming no change in non-asylum seeker migration , total migration in 2015 would be about 2.8 million - though that is a very rough estimate . 
  it 's interesting , and knowing about your ancestors can help you manage your own health . 
  how do you send someone `` back '' if you ca n't prove where `` back '' is ? 
  cameron does n't have a proposal because he ca n't afford to have it shot down , as the impression that would give would result in us leaving . 
  i do n't think he cares what he gets so long as it keeps the uk in the eu . 
  canada has the benefit of being a little bigger than the uk though !, 
  i do n't think any do differentiate . 
  [ it does have an impact ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/may/03/weather-local-elections-2012 ) , but apparently not a significant one in the uk . 
  is portugal like the uk , in that the left are more likely to be put off by rain than the right ? 
  i do n't think anyone wants to handle the problem , which is why only those that are forced to handle it are the ones taking most of the pain . 
  we are rich enough that being able to handle it is not the question , the question is whether people want to handle it . 
  migrants are just people who migrate ( move countries ) for whatever reason , asylum seekers are migrants who want to be considered refugees , and refugees are migrants deemed to be legitimately fleeing persecution . 
  we 'd probably be willing to take more if gross immigration was n't running at over 600,000 a year ( over 300,000 net ) . 
  on the other hand , we are spending the most on foreign aid in absolute terms , and more than most of the eu in relative terms . 
   agreement to resettle up to half a million refugees from turkey into the eu that will go down well . 
  the bible is meant to be divinely inspired rather than actually written by god , is n't it ? 
  lots of it is even named after various authors . 
  if that were the case then people would listen to french music anyway , and there would be no need for a quota . 
  do the reunified family members not also have the ability to reunify with their family members ? 
  person a brings their wife who brings her mum who brings her son and so on . 
  i feel the same way about becoming a us state as i do about becoming a part of a federal eu . 
  on issues where you disagree with the majority you would go from a small voice to no voice , and i would rather that not happen . 
  why is power/influence such a big deal ? 
  if it was then we could all become us states and be happy with that . 
  how does a limit fit with germany ratifying the 1951 refugee convention ? 
  you ca n't refuse to consider an application for asylum , and you ca n't deport people that you determine to be legitimate refugees .
