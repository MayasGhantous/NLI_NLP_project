  the uk will no longer need to wait for a deal acceptable from everyone from wallonia to malta . 
  we do n't have a veto over much - we probably will be reading harry potter whether we want to or not ,, 
  acting like we have n't left before we have left is arrogant ? 
  with the frequency we hear of all of these pivots , some countries must be getting pretty dizzy . 
  no problem . 
  remembering that little bit of news was the basis of my whole argument !, 
   as such the electoral commission are not going to say that both question + answer should switch to leave/remain simply because that 's what they were asked to consider for the eu referendum . 
  they were n't asked to consider remain/leave for the eu referendum - they came up with new phrasing themselves . 
   [ david cameron has accepted ** a recommendation by the electoral commission ** to change the wording of the eu referendum question to avoid favouring the pro-eu side . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/01/eu-referendum-cameron-urged-to-change-wording-of-preferred-question ), 
  if the electoral commission 's thinking on yes/no questions has changed since then , it would be very unusual not to have the question reflect that . 
  i would n't be surprised if a second scottish referendum was leave/remain ( or possibly leave/stay , as some thought remain was clunkier than leave ) . 
  the tories did n't have an official position . 
  conservative mps were lying on both sides of the debate . 
  that is the plan ... 
  very probably . 
  exports are about 4x higher to the rest of the uk than the rest of the eu , and we share a currency . 
  there were two sets of voter data they could use - one for general elections and one for local . 
  the former was a non-starter as it would have allowed scots who moved abroad in the last 15 years to vote but not those who moved to the rest of the uk . 
  it included uk citizens ( other than those resident abroad for over 15 years ) and commonwealth citizens resident in the uk . 
  the latter was based only residence , and included eu citizens too . 
   however that polling has , for reasons unexplained , decided to use the eu referendum 's remain/leave question rather than the independence referendum ( and all subsequent polling ) 's yes/no question . 
  whilst evaluating the wording of the eu referendum they decided that yes/no was likely to influence the outcome ( yes is positive , and that helps whatever the question ) . 
  they decided that leave/remain was more neutral . 
  illegal ? 
  surely the uk just lacks the competency to enter trade deals before brexit , not to negotiate ones that would begin post-brexit . 
   there is no doubt that the uk government has exerted some form of political pressure on natwest to have them close rt 's bank accounts . 
  unless you have some evidence then there is plenty of doubt . 
  rt could take the uk government to court if it truly believed it had done that . 
  germany fulfilling its responsibility to nato is actually great from our point of view . 
  those damn welsh nationalists . 
  it 's the other way around - having a sex-dwarf counterpart is a requirement for most positions here . 
  it 's how they staffed both the leave and remain campaigns . 
   to be honest , if may government rejects referendum bill , separatist feelings in scotland would explode over the roof . 
  not really , polling shows the people of scotland do n't want a referendum at the moment . 
  the snp also repeatedly described the last one as once in a generation . 
   [ both sides of the scottish referendum debate are agreed on one thing : it is a once-in-a-lifetime issue . 
  david cameron underlined this message on tuesday when he told people in scotland independence would be a `` painful divorce '' . 
  alex salmond pledged there would be no second referendum for `` a generation '' , even if he lost by one vote . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/17/scottish-independence-referendum-yes-no-agree-once-in-lifetime-vote ), 
  sure http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-10/u-k-conservatives-open-a-17-point-lead-over-labour-opposition, 
   i think the tory conference announcements ( 2-5 oct ) will probably have a tangible effect on these numbers . . 
  in which direction ? 
  the conservatives have surged to 42 % in the polls , almost as high as the next three parties combined . 
  the money is in exchange for allowing free access to western capital and goods . 
   better together campaign was very fond of going on about how independence would threaten scotland 's place in the eu that was true - if you look at the signatories to any eu treaty you wo n't see scotland listed anywhere . 
  yes guaranteed leaving the eu , no did n't ( after all , scottish leave voters could have kept the uk in the eu if most had voted remain ) . 
  i do n't want to defend this law , but it would only be retroactive if it criminalised past actions , rather than future ones . 
  the complaint was that we do n't call people who move abroad immigrants . 
  i was showing why that complaint is nonsense . 
  it 's not a correction , it 's not understanding how we use prefixes to denote the direction of migration . 
   [ im - ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/im-?s=t )  [ 1 . variant of in - : imbrute ; immigrate ; impassion . 
  ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/im-?s=t ) versus :  [ ex - ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ex - )  [ a prefix meaning `` out of , '' `` from , '' ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ex - ), 
  many highly sensitive jobs only accept you if you are a single nationality british citizen . 
  this is n't anything new . 
   racial hatred is a crime i do n't think so , or every bnp member would have been jailed . 
  we have n't criminalised emotions . 
  no more than england or orkney are . 
  that 's true . 
  seems weird to have a turnout threshold rather than a threshold of votes in favour though , as in some scenarios it is more effective to stay at home than to vote against a measure . 
  30 % for , 25 % against : passes 35 % for , 10 % against : fails despite having more support and less opposition than the above, 
  like the uk referendum , it is n't binding but does create significant political pressure . 
  scotland is n't applying eu regulations in scotland , the uk is . 
  some chapters of the accession criteria require you to show you have strong institutions , and scotland ca n't show that until they have their own . 
  there are no bodies that can pass laws that supersede australian , japanese or canadian laws , are there ? 
  that is within the expected margin of error of + / - 3 %, 
   according to the treaties if a former state or any region/landers of a kind ask independance from its main nation it would be de facto translated as an european member with full protection of eu . 
  firstly , which part of the treaties says that ? 
  secondly , there is no chance of scottish independence before brexit . 
  article 50 takes two years , organising a referendum and then leaving the uk would take more . 
   i 'm sure many voters in scotland would have voted differently if they knew what they were in for . 
  it does n't look like it :  [ ` no real shift ' towards scottish independence since brexit vote - poll ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/30/no-real-shift-towards-scottish-independence-since-brexit-vote-poll ), 
  spending on scotland created some of the debt , and scottish taxes created some of the assets . 
  it is only fair to receive a share of both upon departure . 
  36 % of snp ( who are almost all yes ) voters wanted out of the eu - we do n't know whether the leave vote has turned them to no voters . 
   their option out of brexit is independence . 
  not really , because there are 28 members of the eu and scotland is n't one of them . 
  they 'd be able to join the eu quite easily , but independence would still initially leave them outside of it . 
  he 's just being silly because it amuses some people and wins their votes . 
  it 's how he became mayor of fairly left-wing london for two terms . 
  it could do , but if you think it makes sense to break up the uk because some parts vote differently , then why not do the same to scotland ? 
  england and scotland do n't have wishes , only the uk does . 
  a vote cast in scotland is no more or less valuable than one cast in england or wales . 
   was that leaving the union would put our place in the eu in jeopardy . 
  that was n't a lie - leaving the uk would have * definitely * put scotland outside of the eu ( at least temporarily ) , as scotland is not one of the 28 member states . 
  remaining in the uk made just meant that leaving the eu was not a certainty . 
  no , germany is federal - like austria , switzerland , bosnia and russia . 
   you do realize that the united kingdom is just a supranational block of multiple nations , just like the eu is , right ? 
  we are n't though . 
  [ the uk is a unitary state , like romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unitary_state#/media/file:map_of_unitary_and_federal_states.svg ) . 
  that was n't the feeling here in london . 
  as it is a very labour city , whoever labour picked was probably going to win it . 
  radiators have their own water system , as it needs a certain amount of pressure and also because it gets quite dirty . 
  maybe there is no ulterior motive , and we are simply opposing something because we disagree with it . 
  the system may be called `` air defence '' , but its purpose is to shoot down things in the air , whether those things are attacking or defending . 
  i ca n't see why someone from poland would like him :  [ corbyn even suggests it was wrong to allow countries such as poland , as a former member of the warsaw pact in the soviet orbit , to join nato . 
  asked whether it was a mistake to admit former warsaw pact countries , he says : `` i think it probably was , actually . 
  ** we should have gone down the road ukraine went down in 1990 ** ... ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-interview-we-are-not-doing-celebrity-personality-or-abusive-politics ) '', 
  very misleading title - it 's 150 of 200 `` senior business leaders in the financial services , asset management and professional services sectors '' , not 75 % of all uk businesses . 
  they said there was an increase in reports , not actual crimes .
