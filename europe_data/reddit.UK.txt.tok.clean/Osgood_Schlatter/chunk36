  we 'll have to wait for the proper statistics to be released to know the scale of the increase . 
  if the eu does n't want to talk before article 50 then that is their choice . 
  cameron chose not to prepare as a campaign tactic , so may is having to delay things a bit so we are somewhat ready . 
  would you say that atheists are blue , or everyone but grey ? 
  it would seem fairly masochistic to want your own country to suffer . 
   a united eu military that 's not the proposal . 
  nobody significant is willing to give up their national army . 
  according to our pro-eu chancellor , we are n't staying in the common market . 
   [ philip hammond confirms uk will leave the single market after brexit ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/philip-hammond-brexit-single-market-eu-referendum-theresa-may-cabinet-chancellor-a7136101.html ), 
  that is true , but using a net approach would also more than cancel out all eu spending in northern england . 
  yes , and i believe that my interpretation is what is written . 
   christine bell , professor of constitutional law at edinburgh university , said ** the uk government does have the power to repeal the human rights act throughout the uk . 
  **  she said : `` the human rights act is westminster legislation applying throughout the uk , if it is repealed in its entirety it will be repealed for the whole of the uk . 
   `` however , human rights are also partially devolved , and so any unilateral repeal of the human rights act by westminster would violate the sewel convention , whereby holyrood must give consent to legislation falling within its devolved powers . '', 
  i manually added up the figures for ne england , nw england and yorkshire & humberside, 
  more interestingly than 63 % voting to remain in the uk is that only 22 % would vote to join the republic of ireland . 
  i still do n't agree with the conclusion , so long as scotland is part of the uk and the uk retains parliamentary sovereignty . 
   is the british bankerss association massive slip ups that lead to libor fixing and massive global cheating one of those `` better '' things ? 
  i 'm thinking more of things like how london is such a good place to do business that more euros are traded there than in every other city in europe combined . 
   [ london handled 36.7 % of global currency transactions in 2009 -- an average daily turnover of us$ 1.85 trillion -- with more us dollars traded in london than new york , and more euros traded than in every other city in europe combined ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_london#financial_services ), 
  it 's not whether other countries can do it , but whether they can do it better . 
  we could presumably substitute local products for eu imports too , they 'd just be worse and/or more expensive . 
   the industrial cities of the north have to rely on eu subsidies there are plenty of reasons we might want to be in the eu , you do n't have to make them up . 
  eu spending for the entire uk is [ # 4.5 b ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/ ) , whilst uk spending on northern england is about [ # 136b ] ( http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/total_spending_2015yhbn ), 
   we are sorry to say that you have found our ` sorry ' page while visiting www.scotsman.com  ** you may be attempting to get to a page that does n't exist ** or our web gurus are currently trying to fix the issue . 
  we 're nowhere near a position in which most people are looking after the elderly . 
  if we paid carers and nurses more we 'd have more than enough . 
  maybe we need to move to a system in which one person is a net neutral cost over their lifetime . 
  that way your own previous contributions support your old age , rather relying on the next generation to do so . 
  i 'm sure they do , and currently they are weighing up which of those things it is worth doing given the political climate and the potential economic effects . 
  they can actually - as parliament is sovereign and no parliament can bind a future one . 
  that 's not to say they will , but it is within their power to do so if they want to . 
  my point is we do n't have that many of them relative to most countries , as we have a very high population density, 
  that 's true , but even with less weight we will still usually be the larger party in most trade deals . 
   they will be happy to sell you agricultural products and put your farmers out of business though . 
  that probably is n't a deal breaker for us , unlike many other countries . 
  it just seems weird for someone to start arguing about a term that they introduced into the debate in the first place . 
  evidently it does , or you would n't have used it in a sentence . 
   [ how so ? 
  automatic weapons and assault weapons have both been banned in the last 30 years , with the latter being unbanned only because the assault weapons ban expired . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51epcn/gun_control_meps_give_goahead_for_negotiations_to/d7bquuz ), 
  i do n't think a word itself can actually be fictional , so long as people use it . 
  i was referring to the unbanning of assault weapons, 
  really ? 
  the usa has much laxer gun laws than it used to . 
   a person should never feel that he only has rights so long as the majority wants them to have rights . 
  i 'm not saying that 's a good or bad idea , but it is incompatible with our constitution , which lets parliament do absolutely anything with a simple majority, 
  it is if you add something stupid and then need to take it away again !, 
  icm ( internet and phone ) predicted 53 % leave ; opinium and tns ( both internet ) predicted 51 % leave . 
   it seemed like there would be no brexit based on the aggregate polling data two mainstream online polling companies were pretty much spot on, 
  people are n't alarmed by most terror attacks or rape gang stories either . 
  if we were we 'd be in a constant state of terror . 
   everything they 've predicted has come true in an economic sense everything ? 
   brexit would prompt stock market and house price crash , says imf but ...  however a separate report published today forecast that the uk 's decision to exit the eu will not stop house prices rising , except for a temporary dip in london . 
   the economic think-tank forecasts house prices across the uk will rise by 5.7 per cent this year , down from 6 per cent in 2015 . 
  they will then slow in 2017 , with an estimated growth rate of 2.2 per cent . 
  and  ftse 100 hits one-year high and ftse 250 erases post-brexit losses as uk economy grows by 0.6 pc you can find lots more like that if you google about a bit . 
   do you have a source that any reputable politicians or economists said that brexit would cause the end of western political civilisation [ `` as a historian i fear brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the eu but also western political civilisation in its entirety , '' he ( donald tusk , president of the european council ) told the german newspaper bild . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36515680 )  that millions of jobs depended on being in the eu ? 
  '' [ speaking on bbc breakfast this morning , nick clegg claimed `` millions of jobs in this country that are in one way or another ** dependent on our position in the european union ** '' . 
  a similar claim has been made in a liberal democrat election communication . 
  but , as we 've said before , this is n't quite the case . 
  ] ( https://fullfact.org/news/millions-jobs-linked-eu-not-our-position-within-it/ ) ''  as for the recession thing , you could make a strong argument that we 're currently in/entering one . 
  not without data showing negative economic growth you could n't '' [ the bank of england said the uk will avoid a recession in the wake of the vote to leave the eu ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/8fbe250a-5a5e-11e6-8d05-4eaa66292c32 ) '',

  it 's not whataboutism - the comment i replied to was comparing our values , so i compared them in a different way . 
  i know , i was just disproving that 0 % was not allowed , as the previous commenter implied . 
  we do n't want single market membership - we want the best terms we can get short of free movement . 
  canada/south korea plus , not norway/iceland minus . 
   are easily made invalid maybe to you , but evidently not to most people . 
   now those economists are being proven right . 
  no they have n't , we 've not left the eu yet . 
  everyone was told that , and everyone was also told brexit would cause `` the end of western political civilisation '' , that millions of jobs `` depended '' on being in the eu and that we 'd face an immediate recession . 
  we still voted to leave . 
  the polling suggests that 3 % of the voters are npd gone afd , 3 % are still npd , whilst 18 % are afd from other parties . 
  it does n't really suggest afd = npd . 
   collecting no taxes is a subsidy only if it only applies to certain companies . 
  having 0 % corporation tax is n't a subsidy - which is how estonia gets away with it . 
  why would people be alarmed at something continuing as before ? 
  there does n't appear to have been an increase in racist murders , just increased international media interest . 
  that 's true - your ukip is in government , ours has one seat . 
  there were plenty before too , they just were n't reported on internationally . 
  some people seem to think the eu is expanding its remit beyond what the treaties allow - and that the reasoning used to determine that ireland gave state aid was quite inventive . 
  i do n't know whether that 's true or not , but if it is that might explain it . 
  whatever the answer , that is a separate question . 
   ireland would actually benefit from the commission 's ruling definitely in the short term - but if they lost their status as an abusive tax haven maybe they would lose a greater amount of tax from international businesses relocating . 
  chinese and thai people came ahead of the russians , ukrainians and kosovans . 
  did you read the second paragraph ? 
  that is what i was referring to . 
   but that is not the full picture . 
  consider the percentage-change in migrant numbers , rather than the total headcount , and the opposite pattern emerges ( chart 2 ) . 
  where foreign-born populations increased by more than 200 % between 2001 and 2014 , a leave vote followed in 94 % of cases . 
  the proportion of migrants may be relatively low in leave strongholds such as boston , in lincolnshire ( where 15.4 % of the population are foreign-born ) . 
  but it has grown precipitously in a short period of time ( by 479 % , in boston 's case ) . 
  high levels of immigration do n't seem to bother britons ; high rates of change do . 
  it feels it for many people - the areas most affected by that are the ones that voted most strongly for brexit . 
  it has actually been at least [ 12.7 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign-born_population_of_the_united_kingdom#size_of_the_foreign-born_population ) , not 10 % . 
  my point was the effect , not the scale , but i will correct it .
