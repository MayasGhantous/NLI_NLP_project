  `` access to the single market '' is a formulation that is being used to imply being able to sell into it like pretty much every country worldwide , not being a member of it like norway or france ( which is what it probably should mean ) . 
  only if the question is limited to `` can we be in the single market '' . 
  there 's more to say than that - a canadian/south korean style trade deal or customs union membership ( as in turkey ) does n't require free movement . 
  maybe , or it might exist simultaneously , or it might be a member instead of the current eu nato states . 
  the eu parliament and commission are entities in their own right , rather than being 28 member states cooperating . 
  if sweden thinks it is too harsh ( as mentioned elsewhere ) then it ca n't be awful . 
  apparently it would instate limits on the maximum generosity of member states , not just the minimum - the eu could declare a country safe , and overrule any national bodies saying it is n't . 
  if there is to be an eu-wide approach it will have to upset everyone if it is going to have a chance at getting anywhere . 
  they 're fairly safe at the moment , that spot might be filled by ukip but they are without a leader or deputy leader at the moment . 
  nato operates on co-operation between the armies of member states , presumably an eu army would instead answer to the eu itself . 
  not always . 
  one example is that spain and italy worry about the med but not russia , whilst the baltics are the opposite . 
  we do n't exactly need them , but they are useful as they have some strengths that we do n't . 
  as the strongest country in the world and one of our closest allies it would be stupid not to want them here . 
  from boris that is almost a compliment !, 
  she has a small majority and remembers what happened to the last three conservatives pms , who were all brought down by eu issues . 
  she has to keep her eurosceptics onside , so the three ministers covering brexit are all from leave ( brexit minister , foreign minister , international trade minister ) . 
  i agree , but it would have been possible . 
  more flexibility in that extensions were decided by qmv rather than unanimity . 
  we 'd probably have triggered it immediately if there was more flexibility over the 2 year period after invoking article 50 . 
  i know that - but that is n't eviction from the eu . 
  i do n't think there is a mechanism for that in the treaties !, 
  government help and having a job are by no means mutually exclusive . 
  on average in the uk , earning under # 30k makes you a net recipient of government spending . 
  as depositors vote , politicians are tempted to give them money to secure those votes . 
  i know , but still lower than 70 % . 
  i was n't aware the gap between the uk and france was so big - 25 % less !, 
  image 3 is fairly damning for remain - they did n't win a majority in a single age group when you account for people who did n't vote . 
   around 70 % of constituencies voted to leave . 
  no point counting northern ireland ( where they do n't run ) or scotland ( where the snp is dominating ) , so the figure for relevant seats is even higher than 70 % . 
   why not ? 
  because 80 % of conservative seats voted remain , and labour are in position to challenge them . 
  staying put gives conservatives decent job security . 
  labour are more likely to break apart , but it is still unlikely . 
  has the eu parliament ever decided to ask for less money or less power ? 
  this is n't really news . 
  it is what leave voters want , and if you 'd listened then you would have heard them tell you that , repeatedly . 
  i think it is mostly age , though growing up with x or y being acceptable/taboo probably sticks with you somewhat . 
  would n't that assume that the relevant variable was year of birth rather than age ? 
   there has been a 42 % increase in hate crimes in the uk in the two weeks since the vote . 
  reported hate crimes . 
  we saw a huge increase in reported sexual offences following some major celebrities being exposed as serial rapists and/or child molesters . 
  it will be interesting to see how the rate of convictions changes . 
  if you go to london you 'll probably hear more non-uk than uk accents . 
  the fear is overblown - much as you almost certainly wo n't be raped by a dozen migrants if you go to cologne . 
  the prefix . 
  an immigrant comes , an emigrant ( or expat ) goes . 
  being a young working adult does n't make you a net contributor - earning over # 30k/year does ( on average ) . 
  i think it was probably `` job well done '' - he 's done what he set out to do in 1992 - combined with chronic pain from his aeroplane crash . 
  it is down to a lot of things - but the eu itself had at least some bearing on our vote as to whether we should be a member . 
  i 'd be worried if she did n't - who in the uk would n't want that ? 
  i think the president of the european commission has more influence over and responsibility for the eu than for a star 8.6 light years away , but what do i know . 
  we can never know exactly what he did , nor what he should have done . 
  all we have to go on is the outcome , which is that with him as president of the commission the eu is going to shrink rather than grow for the first time in its history . 
  i thought he said they would be allowed to stay , so long as the eu allowed uk citizens in the eu to do likewise . 
  i ca n't really see a more obvious measure of whether an organisation is succeeding than whether it is growing or shrinking . 
  he 's the first president of the european commission who will see the population and economy of the eu shrink rather than grow . 
  i know , but everyone significant who has spoken on the issue has said that is how it should be . 
  he had influence over cameron 's renegotiation . 
  the concessions were so minor that leave used it as part of their campaign more than remain did . 
  i 'm talking about the renegotiation being so insignificant that it was pretty much only brought up be the leave campaign . 
  her justification is that they would be bringing forward future plans and rushing in before the door closes , as anyone in the uk before we leave will be allowed to stay . 
  one of the largest eu member states just voted to leave ? 
  there are plenty of videos of it, 
  it 's more than that - they decide the structure and range of questions so as to produce answers most favourable to pushing more eu integration . 
  if a question gets an anti-eu response , it is most likely not asked again . 
  but why ? 
  you 're not giving reasons . 
  not very surprising :  [ this paper reviews eurobarometer surveys from 1995 to 2010 and shows how eurobarometer selects and frames questions in ways that systematically produce `` integrationist '' outcomes ] ( http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2681038 )  the violations of the rules of good public opinion research concern incomprehensible , hypothetical , and knowledge-inadequate questions , unbalanced response options , insinuation and leading questions , context effects , and the strategic removal of questions that led to critical responses in previous eurobarometer waves . 
  it is highly unlikely that the violations happen unintentionally . 
  ** eurobarometer therefore blurs the line between research and propaganda ** . 
  in the uk , a poll found that euroscepticism was highest amongst both those with the least knowledge of the eu and those with the most . 
  why would they not need subsidies ? 
  there are currently no borders to bring down , no laws to harmonise and so on due to the eu . 
  the money is because the area is poor , and was made poor partly by decades of fighting . 
  if anything , a change to the constitutional setup will increase that , not decrease it - the latest polls show only 30 % want reunification . 
  what makes you think they would not ? 
  the eu currently transfers # 0.5 b/year to ni , the uk transfers # 9.6 b/year . 
  the uk also transfers # 8.5 b to the eu . 
  the uk leaving the eu and the eu taking on ni would be an additional cost to the eu of about # 18b , or 15 % of the eu budget . 
  irish government spending is about # 22b a year . 
  ireland could make up the uk spending on northern ireland by cutting government spending in the rest of ireland by ** 43.6 % ** . 
  eu funding to northern ireland is [ # 0.5 b ] ( http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/ni-business-news/where-do-eu-grants-to-northern-ireland-go-1-7233873 ) a year , versus [ # 9.6 b ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/northern-ireland-is-officially-one-of-uks-costliest-regions-as-fiscal-deficit-hits-9bn-30152040.html ) a year from the uk . 
  that depends - for instance , i doubt ireland could afford the subsidy that the uk currently provides , which is worth about 33 % of northern irish gdp . 
  corbyn wants to mess up northern ireland too - but instead by transferring it to the republic of ireland . 
  there is no political union in the uk - we are a unitary state with a sovereign parliament in westminster . 
  hence `` united kingdom '' being in the singular . 
  we retain the name `` country '' for england , wales and scotland , but it does not make them sovereign . 
  hopefully - we 're big fans of trade deals ( with one notable exception ), 
  well ... yes . 
  if the market had known what would happen then prices would have adjusted pre-vote . 
  they are under the jurisdiction of the uk , which is in the eu . 
  the uk being in the eu lets london protect use its veto to protect their ability to be a tax haven . 
  if there 's a second independence campaign you will only see the pro-uk side talking about euro membership . 
  polling shows people do n't actually want a second referendum , and more leave voters are happy than remain ones unhappy . 
  unless the uk accepts freedom of movement ( which i doubt ) then scottish eu membership * would * require a physical border . 
  surely if anyone had predicted it in advance it would n't have happened in the first place ? 
  corbyn and mcdonnell think it gives the unionists too much and would rather northern ireland was part of ireland . 
  so are corbyn and mcdonell - they want northern ireland to join ireland . 
   a newspaper which is normally very harsh in how it views the eu on the uk spectrum it loves the eu .
