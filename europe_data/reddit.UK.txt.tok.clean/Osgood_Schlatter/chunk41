   the people our issue is the lack of european identity here means we do n't see it as `` the people '' electing them , but `` the people ** s ** '' , most of whom are not us . 
  london may trade more euros than any other city , but it also trades more dollars than new york despite us not being part of the usa . 
  there will be significant damage to the city , but it will not be as bad as some are suggesting . 
  64 % of brits have no european identity ( the highest in the eu ) , 15 % see themselves as somewhat european and only 4 % feel primarily european . 
  [ source - pdf ] ( http://whatukthinks.org/eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/analysis-paper-2-do-we-feel-european.pdf ), 
  co-operation is popular , but there is co-operation outside of the eu - such as nato . 
   where the hell is this federalism talk coming from ? 
  the eu treaties ? 
  cameron demanded an opt-out of `` ever closer union '' for a reason . 
  not austria - they nearly elected a hard right anti-eu populist as president . 
   are there countries in the eu that have high support for a use ? 
  some countries have strong support for many areas of the eu , no major country has strong support for all areas . 
  claims 1 and 2 have n't been broken - neither of those people you quote are in a place to break them , as they are not even in parliament . 
  claim 3 was promised by remain , not leave , so leave ca n't break it . 
  i think 1 was so vague ( `` could '' ) it means nothing , and 2 will be kept . 
  people do n't want 3 anyway , so who cares . 
  that 's just dan hannan - he 's not in government and wants to abolish the nhs . 
  he 's neither mainstream nor particularly influential . 
  96 % remain , but [ 98.5 % to stay in the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar_sovereignty_referendum,_2002 ) . 
  they said from turkey to the russian border , not the turkish border to the russian border . 
  they are talking about the eu customs area , not the eea . 
  it is different , and does n't have free movement : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_customs_union, 
  there is no free movement with canada , south korea or turkey . 
  that 's the sort of deal that we could go for , even if it is partial . 
  this sub does n't show the same news that the bbc does , and bbc news is the news to watch in the uk . 
  pound is used both for currency and for weight ; ounce is a subdivision of pound ( weight ) . 
  gove was adopted , and adopted kids fare worse than pretty much any other group in the uk . 
  sure , but the former is not much different to now if we 're going to be leaving soon anyway . 
  yes , but i did n't say otherwise . 
   leave had a 1,269,501 vote lead . 
  the number of scots voting leave was 1,018,322 so no , we could not have swung the vote with the turnout that we had your maths is wrong - you remove the 1,018,322 scottish leave votes and then add them back as 1,018,322 new scottish remain votes and you get an overall remain lead of 767,143 . 
  qmv ca n't be used to alter the treaties , that requires unanimity amongst all 28 members . 
  if the eu were to violate its own laws like that then we 'd be better off out anyway . 
  before we leave , any treaty change requires our consent ... 
  there were leave voters in scotland and northern ireland too , you know ... 
  there is no mechanism for the eu to evict a member state, 
  of course it means a lot , but i think their point is that the eu will be losing access to the uk market too . 
  you say that like everyone in scotland wanted to remain but everyone in england and wales wanted to leave . 
  in reality , scottish leave voters voting remain would have been enough to have swung it to an overall remain vote . 
  referendums are not devolved . 
  the scottish people spoke in 2014 , and they voted to remain in the unitary state that is the uk - and part of that means following the majority verdict in this referendum . 
  it 's still at least two years before anything actually changes, 
  do n't hold your breath !, 
  westminster needs to pass a law for that . 
  they even delayed it a little so as to be able to get a full write up of the outcome . 
  i think i can say fairly confidently that we 'd never vote for that !, 
  i think that is what is known as sarcasm . 
  lots of time , i guess . 
  the problem is a majority of the electorates do not wish to be one nation !, 
  that * is * when the new `` independence day '' film comes out in the uk . 
   i 've gotten in numerous discussions with competent people who do n't even know who their local mep is the only mep people know is farage - and many probably do n't know he 's an mep , just that he is head of ukip . 
  that is n't how a federation is defined , [ we 're not a federation ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/map_of_unitary_and_federal_states.svg/863px-map_of_unitary_and_federal_states.svg.png ) ( only those in green are ) , and wales does n't have tax raising powers . 
  none , hence me calling it a transfer . 
  there are no federal taxes , we are a unitary state, 
   i 'd say that the eu has benefited parts of wales more than the uk government has the uk transfers # 15 billion a year to wales ( 24 % of gdp ) ; the eu transfers # 0.5 billion ( 0.8 % of gdp ) .

  i think it depends on the audience - where i work nobody is willing to publicly say they are in favour of brexit . 
  it 's nothing to do with the monarchy , but because our parliament is sovereign - legally it has absolute power to do whatever it wants , courts can only advise it . 
  it 's borderline - some on the left would suggest you were racist if you said you were in favour of brexit . 
  i know , i only mentioned it because the guy above did first . 
  there are n't that many politicians openly advocating it . 
  parliament is about 4:1 in favour of remain . 
  important issues that do n't break on party lines are ideal for referendums . 
  voting yes * is * considered politically incorrect , and is backed by the elderly ( who are more likely to vote ) . 
  they think it will be down to turnout - low and leave wins , high and remain wins . 
  he bought manuals on how to make guns and explosives over a decade ago . 
  i was responding to your argument that fptp does n't work because of corbyn and trump . 
  i do n't like fptp , i was just criticising your argument . 
  as your argument was based on weak examples , i gave a stronger one to refute it . 
  the money was set at the level at which the average person is not a net drain on government finances . 
  i did n't say she was n't the sovereign , but that does n't mean she is sovereign . 
  parliament limited the power of the monarch by force in the past , back when the role was n't ceremonial , and those rules are still in effect . 
  maybe you are talking at cross-purposes - you referring to only the countries that were in the eu back then , and he to all of ones that are in it now . 
  that is not a good argument - your examples of fptp failing have n't won , whereas i can invoke godwin 's law to point to an extremist who did win in a pr system . 
   your side of the discussion which side would that be ? 
  i 've not said anything on what i support in this thread . 
  av would have a similar outcome - pr would be the answer . 
  the powers that could be exercised by the queen are limited to those that full under '' [ the royal prerogative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_prerogative_in_the_united_kingdom ) '' . 
  i did n't say anything about the eu being undemocratic . 
  it 's not that simple - the fptp system used in westminster works to prevent any but the two major parties winning . 
  they can do whatever they want either way - parliament is sovereign ; they could take us out of the eu on a whim if they wanted . 
  the wolf has moldova , ukraine and georgia in its mouth already . 
  we should listen to the boy . 
  yes it does - a defensive war . 
  nobody thinks latvia is going to invade russia !, 
  he was a politician looking to win over the london electorate . 
  he had to champion immigration because over half the population are from ethnic minorities . 
  i do n't think he believes strongly in anything either way . 
  she 's a figure head with significant theoretical powers , he is not . 
  we do n't have any division of church and state - our head of state is the head of the church of england , and archbishop of cantebury is one of many bishops who get an automatic seat in the house of lords . 
  that 's a prediction of the outcome , not of the vote share . 
  i doubt anyone would oppose you choosing to share your own wealth ; some might be upset if you chose to share theirs though . 
   but it certainly should n't be promoted like this or in any other way . 
  why not ? 
  i was under the impression it made hitler look completely deranged . 
  it 'd take six months of negotiations , four bilateral summits and sixteen concessions to latvian pig farmers for brussels to offer us anything significant . 
  there 's not time . 
  they 're a member of the [ british polling council ] ( http://www.britishpollingcouncil.org/officers-members/ ) , so they are legitimate . 
   we initially voted to join the eec no , we voted not to leave . 
  it seems most remain campaigners preface their statements by `` i know the eu needs reform , but ... '' .
