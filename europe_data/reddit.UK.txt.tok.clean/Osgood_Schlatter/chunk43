  for germany it would be $ 750b , or just under $ 10,000 per person . 
  so if the netherlands left , would they would have to `` settle the bill '' and [ be given $ 99.6 b ] ( http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/reports.do?node=1000004859 ) ? 
  not really - the east of england and south east of england get less net spending per head than any other part of the uk . 
  [ source - pdf ] ( http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/sn04033/sn04033.pdf ) they 're also only 22 % of seats in parliament and 92 % of them are already conservative . 
  a conservative party that only cared about them could not win . 
   in the uk , oliver cromwell is revered as a great military leader because that 's what they 're told in school . 
  we never even covered him - the only person who got that sort of treatment was churchill . 
  if you were n't a tudor or killing nazis you did n't really get mentioned . 
  the celebrations are from people who wanted to `` properly '' leave the eu - ending things like free movement and the jurisdiction of the ecj . 
  she 's said that is her plan , so they are elated . 
   none of them have any restrictions loosened on the movement of services that is wrong . 
  the south korea-eu agreement includes services . 
   [ it is also the most comprehensive the eu has ever negotiated : import duties are near eliminated on all produce and there is deep liberalisation in trade in services . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union%e2%80%93south_korea_free_trade_agreement ), 
  closer than turkey , further than switzerland . 
  maybe customs union membership with extra co-operation in some other areas through bilateral treaties . 
   the eu simply can justify not having jurisdiction over a large part of its banking sector . 
  i guess it would n't be the eu 's banking sector , much as the eu would n't be the uk 's manufacturing sector . 
  i can see your point though , and banking is probably easier to disrupt than manufacturing . 
  needing to be better in one area should n't stop us looking to be better in others . 
  people have the right to physical integrity . 
  children ca n't consent to giving that up , and the procedure is n't reversible if they later decide they do n't want to be circumcised . 
  children ca n't provide consent to genital mutilation . 
  if they still believe they want it done when they are 18 then they can practice that belief all they want . 
  they are more able to provide consent . 
  evidently not , because it is still legal to do it to little boys for non-medical reasons . 
  nobody is predicting that - the imf thinks it will hit 2.6 % next year then fall back to 2 % , which is the target . 
  those referendums did work out well - they blocked something that a majority of people in those countries thought was a bad idea . 
  i think it might be fading into the skin/background, 
  the average of everyone is more attractive than average because it smooths out all of the imperfections . 
  that does n't make it nonsense . 
  `` if you vote for x they will commit us to joining the euro - just watch them wriggle away from the question when you ask them '' it does n't need to be reasonable to be effective, 
  the eu accession process requires a country to make a commitment to joining the euro . 
  i doubt the scottish people would vote for that , even if the snp say they will never meet that commitment . 
  i thought i remembered a reputable site running this story , but a google search suggests the other sites are all even less reputable than this one . 
  someone found [ this ] ( http://www.expressen.se/administration/thomas-mattsson-chattade-om-kriminaljournalistik/ ) in swedish though . 
  that 's wrong again . 
  if you are british and move to spain and get a job , you are an emigrant/expat to me but an immigrant to a spaniard . 
  society taking revenge against people who abuse children might dissuade them from doing it in the first place . 
  better the state do it than individuals . 
  i know punishment does n't always work , but it does have a role to play . 
  it 's not really doublethink - the prefix tells you the direction of travel . 
  expat is a synonym for emigrant , which would be the equivalent word for immigrant but in the other direction . 
  a british person abroad would not be called an immigrant by someone from the uk , they would be called an emigrant . 
  it does mostly prevent vigilantism, 
   the swiss constitution is n't really like the us constitution as there is nobody to enforce it what 's the point of it then ? 
  if a court ca n't enforce it is seems more like a set of guidelines than anything meaningful . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/201601010000/101.pdf ) is a link to a pdf of the swiss constitution :  article 121a  the number of residence permits for foreign nationals in switzerland shall be restricted by annual quantitative limits and quotas can someone explain how that is compatible with this story ? 
  the arithmetic might well work that way without fptp to prop up the two big parties . 
  lots of pr countries have had to move to left-right coalitions as the unpalatable extreme fringes grow . 
  i think it is just a comment on a disunited/weak opposition , rather than saying they are the same, 
  if our parliament was like the eu it would be lab-lib-con coalitions every term . 
   there 's barely any immigrants in many of these places . 
  many parts of the uk with higher immigration voted to stay . 
  it was the rate of immigration that correlated with an area voting leave , rather than the absolute amount of immigrants . 
  it 's not only 36 % who are worried , it is only 36 % who put it as their top worry . 
  [ 77 % of people want it reduced , including 55.7 % of the population who want it reduced by `` a lot '' ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/ ) . 
  at the last election they polled / r/unitedkingdom and the green party ( who got ~ 4 % ) had significantly more support than the conservatives ( who got ~ 37 % ) . 
   am i missing something here ? 
  yes, 
  the daily mail backed leave whilst the mail on sunday backed remain . 
  the times ( owned by the guy who owns the sun ) did the opposite - the daily backed remain , the sunday version backed leave . 
  he also owns the times , which backed remain . 
  his papers just followed their readers . 
  you are right . 
  i think it is a reaction against some people equating refugee status with the right to live wherever in the world you want . 
  i do n't think many of his voters see that as his job - yet to be honest , i doubt most people could name any british mep other than farage . 
  whatever he has been doing is popular though - with him as their only recognisable name they went from 4th in 1999 to 3rd in 2004 , then 2nd in 2009 and finally `` winning '' in 2014 . 
   the eu constantly was bending the rules for the uk bending the rules implies we were somehow in breach of them - but they explicitly excluded us in the first place . 
   these reservations have been known since before the euro was ever introduced . 
  once you 're in the euro it 's very hard to leave . 
  i think it was designed to be that way in order to force more integration than national electorates might otherwise have accepted . 
  i tried to avoid judgement calls and just went with what wikipedia had down - though i replaced pro-europeanism with pro-eu as i was n't convinced europeanism was a word , and it took too long to type . 
  the bbc do n't refer to anything as terrorism any more as they see it as a subjective term . 
  it 's just `` dissidents '' , `` rebels '' , `` gunmen '' or similar now . 
  we have actually used our taxes to fund a body ( the bbfc ) that researched the issue , and found it all to be fake . 
  i do n't think the current lot have claimed to be in favour of small government . 
  the first result on google for `` theresa may small government '' includes this :  [ she stressed the importance of the role of the state and the need for government to be a force for good , saying : `` it 's time to remember the good that government can do . '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/05/theresa-may-patriotic-speech-conservative-party-conference-live/ ), 
  is there a different word in danish for danish nationality and danish ethnicity ? 
  in england the issue is somewhat confused by english ( often associated with ethnicity ) versus british ( often associated with nationality ) . 
  it seems to justify cameron leaving it a few years ago - our conservatives almost all voted against . 
  they do n't like the military . 
  our green party wanted all of our weapons factories to be moved over to making wind turbines . 
  i just pulled descriptions from wikipedia to avoid being accused of bias . 
  mostly . 
  s&d were the least cohesive group as many of their german , danish , swedish and austrian meps voted against whilst most of their british meps abstained . 
  in favour : - epp ( centre right , eu federalists ) 193 to 0 - alde ( liberal , centrist , pro-eu ) 56 to 3 - s&d ( social democratic , pro-eu ) 108 to 28 against : - enf ( far right , nationalists ) 0 to 36 - gue-ngl ( democratic socialist , soft eurosceptics ) 0 to 48 - efdd ( populist , eurosceptics ) 1 to 41 - non-attached ( other ) 1 to 13 - greens ( ... ) 2 to 42 - ecr ( eurosceptic , anti-federalist , conservatives ) 8 to 44, 
  that 's just a list of countries where more meps opposed than supported the measure . 
   with a history as one of the most violent and unstable regions on the planet when not politically united * when not democratic . 
  stable democracies do n't fight major wars with each other anywhere in the world , not just in europe . 
   if all eu countries go to 2 % , why the fuck would they need nato anyway ? 
  a baltic state on 2 % is still nothing against russia . 
   i think we can all agree that the choice to make such a colossal decision based on a simple majority vote and the resulting instability are proof of the utter incompetence of the british government . 
  it was n't actually decided by the referendum , but by the large majority of mps ( 498 to 114 ) who voted to allow the prime minister to activate article 50 , and by the prime minister who then decided to do so . 
   but chose not to exercise it i 'm not sure about that - i think we were one of the driving forces behind the single market and for expansion into eastern europe , and that we prevented/reduced integration in many other areas . 
  use laws that forbid you to incite violence ? 
  i think that is basically one of the several recommendations :  excess deficit countries should move forward with fiscal consolidation, 
  i was generalising , as it was `` eli5 '' . 
  some rich countries buy a lot more stuff than they sell , and some rich countries sell a lot more stuff than they buy . 
  this has been the case for a while , and has been getting more pronounced ( for rich countries - the opposite has been happening for poor ones ) .
