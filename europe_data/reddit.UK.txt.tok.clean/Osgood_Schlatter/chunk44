  eventually this will breakdown and be painful for all involved . 
  to prevent this , the uk/usa need to save and increase productivity , the netherlands/germany/etc need to raise wages and spend more . 
  maybe it includes countries that are not picked out individually ? 
  it was n't relevant to disprove the point - the irish government is n't the sum of everyone who is n't an imperialist . 
  because it is n't close enough . 
  the wikipedia article says the term was first used to refer to these island in the first century bc , and was probably drawn from the native celtic language . 
  it does n't imply british rule of ireland any more than `` ireland '' implies dublin ruling over belfast , or `` the americas '' implies us rule over canada . 
   it 's only imperialists who insist on calling ireland british . 
  i do n't think [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles ) is known for being a bastion of imperialism . 
  the bottom four countries for renewable energy are the same as the top four for population density , so whilst you may not have done as much as you could there is probably not a huge amount more a left-ish government could have done . 
  you should n't be - in the eu , the share of renewable energy correlates very strongly with population density . 
  i never realised the current border was so similar to the [ 10th century one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:polska_960_-_992.svg ) . 
  no , because i am not sure my first statement is correct . 
  i was just trying to refine the argument you often see , which is that x or y should n't have human rights . 
  people may have fought for rights for a long time , but that does n't mean they fought for the current setup in their current exact wording . 
  the issue is n't that they have rights , just that the rights that currently exist are unbalanced . 
  misleading headline - it was a non-binding vote !, 
   the legislation still needs to be approved by each of the member state 's individual governments, 
   no country is ( or rather was ) legally bound to that agreement . 
  it is still the case that no country is bound to the agreement . 
  this vote is non-binding . 
   the legislation still needs to be approved by each of the member state 's individual governments, 
  greece can choose to default if it does not like repaying what it borrowed . 
  to get the benefits of bankruptcy you must first go bankrupt . 
  surely we do , from the experience of east germany ? 
  there are plenty of reasons not to like her , but calling her `` witchy '' makes it sound like being a woman is the one you care most about . 
  they exist to keep northern ireland in the uk , so they basically have no choice but to back the conservatives over a corbyn-led labour ( as corbyn has said he is in favour of a united ireland ) . 
  they are to the right of the conservatives on social issues , and are the more militant of the two main pro-uk parties in northern ireland - a mirror of sinn fein . 
  ideology ( from wikipedia ) : - british nationalism - national conservatism - social conservatism - british unionism - euroscepticism - right-wing populism, 
  polling was within the margin for error for both - with some polling firms correctly predicting a small lead for leave and a two point lead for clinton . 
  no , our crime figures come from a survey of the population rather than from the police . 
  the police statistics were deemed too unreliable to be of any use by the [ uk statistics authority ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/15/police-crime-figures-status-claims-fiddling ) , as the police kept fiddling the results . 
   yes , and as long as you want to live in a country where laws matter , you ca n't jail someone for that . 
  and when you vote for idiots that cut 20.000 police jobs , do n't cry when there is not enoguh staff to monitor properly . 
  you seem to start by opposing mass surveillance by the police , but end saying the opposite . 
  crime fell in parallel with police numbers though - which would suggest it was n't an unreasonable policy . 
  if the decision is irreversible then it should have the consent of the people involved . 
  even greenpeace 's headline does n't describe our position as a torpedo . 
  i 'd rather that international law be violated yet again than the one preventing the use of chemical weapons be left to rot . 
  our older generation voted to stay in the eu in 1975 ... 
  that 's a good question !, 
  you do n't need to prove your id to the police . 
  the bank might ask for utility bills and a birth certificate/passport/driving license . 
  it 's annoying that the one time the conservatives do n't put wealthy elderly people first , labour decides those people are the ones who are most in need of handouts . 
  it 's not the votes that matter , but the fact that the outcome of an election was manipulated . 
  this is unrelated to the referendum though - the conservative party were neutral , and the government is lead by a remain voter . 
  that is interesting - we have something similar , only it is `` foreign and commonwealth '' instead - i wonder if that was where he got the idea from ? 
  lots of people may have died , but i 'm still glad we did n't leave poland alone !, 
   though their views often seemed legit . 
  it was the eus fault to make exceptions instead of eu-wide reforms . 
  i do n't think it was a choice between some countries having exceptions and everyone adopting a rule , but between some countries having exceptions and the rule being vetoed . 
   the problem is they have now started making decisions to undermine the eu before leaving . 
  no , we 've been doing it for much longer than that . 
  that will only happen if corbyn wins . 
  the tories do n't particularly want protectionism or nationalisation . 
  that is the spanish government 's argument , but article 310 of the unclos explicitly says that sort of statement can not '' [ purport to exclude or to modify the legal effect of the provisions of this convention ] ( http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm ) '' - and that is why spain 's claims do not stand up . 
  the airport is a legitimate dispute , but there is no real argument as to why you would detach the waters from land - as stated in article 2 of unclos , which spain has signed . 
   np because actually for spain they were on theirs waters spain ca n't unilaterally change an international law that it has signed up to ... 
  i do n't think so . 
  i do n't like the snp , but they are n't anywhere near to being the scottish nazi party ... 
   ` member the 2010 election when tory got 32 % , labour 35 % and lib dems got 22 % and lib dems decided to go with tory ? 
  i do n't . 
  i remember the 2010 election in which the [ tories got 36 % and labour 29 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_2010 ) , though . 
  it 's not quite half of the uk applying ... [ 51,079 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/15/number-of-britons-seeking-irish-passports-rises-by-two-thirds ) people is about 0.08 % . 
  we 're not doing anything wrong or unusual . 
   strict u.k. election rules prevent the government signing up to anything sensitive in the run-up to a vote . 
  according to those guidelines , during the immediate period before an election , the government must `` observe discretion in initiating any new action of a continuing or long-term character '' that would bind the next administration . 
  the `` purdah '' period , as it is known , started on saturday , april 22 , before last week 's budget meeting . 
  [ ... ]  the financial review would likely have been signed off months ago if it had n't been for the italians blocking it in november ahead of then prime minister matteo renzi 's failed referendum on changes to the constitution . 
  the trouble is , i would imagine the unionist paramilitaries would say the same . 
  only one country has a majority think things are going the right direction in the eu !, 
  ireland is top at 55 % , greece bottom at 9 % . 
  the average is 25 % . 
  those are legitimate grievances , but it is worth noting that you described all of them using the past tense . 
  societal pressure is not the same as being forced ; people are still free to ignore it . 
   the real question is to what extent it 's the result of being socialised into being interested in different things . 
  another important question is that if it is caused by societal pressure , does that necessarily mean we need to do something to combat that ? 
  my point was that the uk voted for it , whereas switzerland is not voting for it . 
  we did n't passively `` lose '' our gun rights , we actively chose to get rid of them . 
  that 's not what is happening in switzerland . 
  it was higher than that - we had a 10.2 % deficit in 2009 . 
  it did n't disappear under 18 years of thatcher and major , why would it disappear now ? 
  they often remove northern ireland completely as the parties are all different . 
  some of it might be to do with being seen as the best party to stop a second independence referendum . 
  that would be the best result for any single party since [ 1924 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_1924 ) . 
  they are in meltdown over this one too :  st/panelbase scotland poll change from 2015 snp 44 % ( -6 ) con 33 % ( +18 ) lab 13 % ( -11 ) lib dems 5 % ( -2 ), 
  i think the right dislike him for mass immigration and eu integration more than for iraq . 
  the left also dislike him for continuing with thatcher 's economic liberalisation . 
   all superpowers ( usa , china , russia ) try to dismantle the eu all us leaders prior to trump were actually big fans , and china still seems to be in favour of eu integration . 
  there 's a bit of a difference - the daily mail has a printing press and a website , whilst erdogan has an army , a police force and the judiciary . 
  i think it 's a reference to the catholic church . 
  the uk is one member state , not a collection of them . 
  two thirds of their voters were remain , but two thirds of their traditional voting bloc ( the working class ) voted leave . 
  i 'd say nuclear weapons , nato and stable democracies are the main causes of peace , with the eu helping maintain the third of those - particularly in the countries that were in the warsaw bloc . 
  how is it a euphemism ? 
  the eu is more a product of peace than the cause of it , though it does help somewhat . 
  they may be unable to do much in practice , but they do seem to at least be trying . 
  cracking down fgm and `` honour '' crimes is actually something the government are fairly keen on , as it popular on both the left ( protecting the victims ) and the right ( punishing the criminals ) . 
  the uk seems to be the only country not to have failed to meet the [ sgp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact ) obligations , as paragraph 4 of treaty protocol no 15 gives us the only opt out . 
  luxembourg has met the rules since 2011 , germany since 2012 and sweden since 2015 .
