  everyone else is currently in breach of some rule or another , so it 's not really any surprise that the eu ca n't enforce them . 
  it 's what it sounds like - there are no snakes on the island of ireland . 
  the rules are fairly meaningless , given that breaking them never incurs a penalty . 
  cameron said he would not stay on past 2020 , so someone needs to replace him . 
  party members are overwhelmingly eurosceptic , and boris is the biggest name on the leave campaign . 
  you read the odd story about atheist children being evicted by fundamentalist christian parents . 
  we moved from intervening to help industry at the expense of services to letting market forces decide , rather than actively forcing industry to close down . 
  i think the opposite is true for capitalism - there are compelling arguments against it , but in practice it works better than any other system . 
  the top ranked countries by any metric use capitalism . 
  globalisation and automation has seen a shift from manufacturing to services all over the world , not just in the uk . 
  they seem to swing one way or the other after big events , then return to ~ 33 % a few days later . 
  london and the south east transfer huge amounts of their money to the rest of the country every year - in the recession , they were the only two regions not running a deficit . 
  at $ 8/hour [ you would pay 6 % tax in the uk ] ( https://listentotaxman.com/6.27?time=1950 ) , not 50 % . 
  you can add a bit on for vat , but if you lived frugally that would be quite low , as most basic goods are vat-exempt . 
  the communism in people 's minds is all well and good , but the communism that actually gets implemented does n't work so well . 
  the problem is that communism was the answer to none of those things . 
   not just psychically * physically - unless you mean via telekinesis !, 
  china is much bigger , and much closer to the territory than argentina . 
  we could n't have fought them off . 
  so long as turkey is [ in the process of joining the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) , to say so is not fearmongering . 
  it 's only early stages , but it is happening . 
  of course we could - wages would just have had to be higher . 
  we might have lost some low-wage industries , but that 's not such a bad thing . 
  in fairness it is europe that russia likes to invade , not north america . 
  we have a much bigger incentive to punish them for that than the usa does . 
   `` we will not allow ourselves to be divided and we stand together for a compassionate society . '', 
  we 're here to stand up for compassion - with sticks , burning tyres and iron bars !, 
   despite the protest , that saw some people carrying sticks and iron bars and burning tyres , the conference began as planned on saturday morning . 
  i just [ took a photo ] ( http://imgur.com/qsugeio ) of the underside of my arm for you , with a passport cover for comparison . 
  people can be that pale !, 
  an unusually blunt title for the bbc . 
  if this guy was convicted of rape in 2014 , how is he free in 2016 ? 
  sounds like a reasonable tactic to push them into applying sooner rather than later . 
  i think these rules would ban the flags of england , wales and scotland too - it 's just a ban on all non-sovereign flags . 
  it is hard to argue that russia is not a military threat to european countries , given it is currently occupying parts of three of them . 
  i was thinking more about the potential need for european nations to intervene in nearby countries to stop genocide . 
  nobody wants genocide , and nobody wants another migrant crisis . 
  would it be possible to do a denmark and tie your currency to the euro without actually joining ? 
  we should all be at least meeting the 2 % target ; if there is a war that needs fighting it should be able to be carried out locally without the usa having to agree to help . 
  the do n't push the `` magic button '' because they would get fined by the echr , like italy was when they started returning boats rather than operating a ferry service . 
  if your president has those powers , then using them would not be a coup - as by definition that is the * illegal * seizing of power . 
  winning an election is not a coup . 
  much of the difference is that our government subsidies per capita are much lower than in the rest of europe . 
  it 's $ 70/head here versus ~ $ 205/head in france or germany . 
  in the uk the queen can `` decide '' things , but in reality she just follows protocol set by the government . 
  it is probably similar in spain . 
  they can both be right - one shows how often the uk agrees with denmark , the other how often denmark agrees with the uk . 
  88 % agreement between us puts us at the bottom of your list , but puts you near the top of ours . 
  yes - what we really need to play a significant role in the world is a federal nato , with the us army commanded from brussels and open borders from hawaii to kurdistan . 
  the western world needs to stick together . 
  fragmenting wo n't do any of us any favours . 
  affirmative action is meant to be illegal in the uk ... 
  i would n't be surprised if they were in favour - though united as part of the uk !, 
  i 'd rather not have a russian invasion of eastern europe , thanks . 
   mobilising $ 50bn of public ** and private ** funding so how much cash are they * actually * going to splash ? 
  the article does n't seem to say . 
  i take it you have missed the constant sheep-shagging jokes made about the welsh and new zealanders . 
  people from rural areas are the butt of bestiality jokes no matter their skin colour . 
   [ betteridge 's law of headlines is an adage that states : `` any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines ), 
  it was a stupid comment , but it 's worth remembering that obama 's kenyan grandfather was actually tortured by the british . 
  that is not the right comparison - we see the uk as equivalent to a small usa , not a big hawaii . 
  the eu would then be nafta , and the us states would be england , scotland , northern ireland and wales . 
  the cheap ones are [ only # 1.33 / kg ] ( http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=292213130 ) ( $ 1.70 / kg ) here . 
  yes ? 
  unless every company there makes a loss . 
  keep unemployment and unskilled immigration low , and wages will have to rise as companies compete for workers . 
  it 's a reddit comment , not a thesis . 
  i never said you should be afraid , just that the comment you were replying to was not making a completely unreasonable prediction . 
  the media seem to prefer to use - exit rather than - xit where possible , else the uk would be a brixit . 
  do n't vote for parties willing to work with them either , and let them know that is why you wo n't vote for them . 
  there 's not much more you can do than that . 
  it 's currently 5 % , with a migration policy and a younger population profile favouring further growth . 
  they 'll keep using them , as headlines have limited space . 
  so far there is no evidence that cameron actually dodged any taxes . 
  lies to scare the electorate . 
  they signed one with oman in 2009 , which has an economy 3 % the size of that of the uk . 
  they got lots of free publicity . 
  sure :  '' [ a racial group means a group of persons defined by reference to race , colour , nationality ( including citizenship ) or ethnic or national origins . 
  ] ( http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/racist_and_religious_crime/#a03 ) '' i was just referring to the official usage , which does n't actually match what the word really means . 
  in the uk at least , the official definition of racism includes ethnicity , nationality and jewishness . 
  i 'd be in favour , but the left wing probably would n't be . 
  it 'd be called neo-colonialism , murder of people reliant on aid and all sorts . 
  if there is no compulsory aspect to the quota , how is that part any different from the current system ? 
  we 've both got an opt out on migration . 
  it 's france and belgium ( and switzerland ? ), 
  that would be screwed by this . 
   create a legal immigration corridor , only open to speakers of the language of the country they would immigrate to , and that have attended an introductory course . 
  give us time to switch to welsh first , please . 
  based on how our census works , she is british asian - with the former being her nationality , and the latter her ethnicity . 
  they are n't exactly forced , but they suffer lots of war exhaustion if they do n't send a peace offer . 
   upon offering unconditional surrender , all of your currently unoccupied provinces will fall under enemy control and your enemy will gain 100 % warscore . 
  your armies in your own provinces will become exiled and unable to fight in future battles until peace is signed . 
  for the recipient of an unconditional surrender , you will be alerted of your enemy 's surrender and from then on will be able to enforce any possible peace up to 100 % warscore cost . 
  if you do not sign peace , then after a couple months you will get call for peace giving you monthly war exhaustion which increases faster than normal . 
  the peace you offer will automatically be accepted by the surrendering nation . 
   for the time being , the ai does not offer unconditional surrender . 
  they will however , gladly accept them . 
  you can probably drop the surrender rule for the next campaign , as the latest version has an unconditional surrender button . 
  as we 're both net contributors , you 're not really giving * us * anything - just altering where the money given to eastern and southern europe comes from .
