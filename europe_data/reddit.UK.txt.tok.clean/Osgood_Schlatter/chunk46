  you do actually get a 75 % rebate on our 66 % rebate , along with sweden , austria and germany . 
  past integration was designed to be too painful to undo , but future integration can still be prevented . 
  you are confusing `` democratic '' with `` good '' . 
  it 's not a serious comment - it 's a parody of the comments we get when we moan about the eu . 
  probably the same as it currently is , just with an ending that rhymes with serbia . 
   union prevents another war between european nations . 
  what makes you say so ? 
  we 've seen unions and even unified nations collapse into war before . 
  the stuff described in the article sounds good , but it should only apply to companies that owned the data in the first place - for example , you should be allowed to force google to delete its history of how you used its services , but not to hide newspaper articles about you when someone searches for your name . 
  the right to privacy is n't absolute : [ article 10 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_10_of_the_european_convention_on_human_rights ) of the echr protects your right to free speech and information too . 
   everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
  this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and ** to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority ** and regardless of frontiers . 
  the only people who could remove significant amounts of unknowns ( the uk government and eu ) will not do so as it would weaken their case . 
  they prefer to just keep coming up with vague suggestions the uk would be like north korea and suddenly people would have no rights and no trade . 
  what would you do if that constitution sided with the `` ultra-conservatives '' ? 
  there 'd not be an easy way to change it . 
   europe needs a us-style first amendment desperately . 
  no , we just need to make sure control of this never passes from the national governments . 
  if other countries want stupid laws , let them have them . 
  nigel farage is probably the only eu politician most british people could name . 
  i 'm not saying what i want , just that a customs union is not dependent on freedom of movement . 
   the uk will be subject to freedom of movement if it wants to be part of the customs union wrong . 
  turkey is [ already in the eu customs union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_customs_union ) without free movement . 
  if they are , it wo n't affect anyone who came here before 2013 - as they will be eligible for citizenship by then . 
   because a union of european countries has a more powerful position on global politics/economy , than each country on their own . 
  that would also be true if we all became us states or russian federal subjects - that does n't mean it is necessarily a good thing . 
  unfortunately it was 18 % that disagreed , not 48 % . 
   and the ~ ~ english ~ ~ british government could do likewise slight mistake there ... 
  no , that is wrong . 
  eu citizenship is supplementary to national citizenship . 
  no , we have an eu-standardised national passport ) . 
  eu citizenship would need to be a stand-alone concept for there to be an eu passport . 
   [ the european union itself does not issue ordinary passports , but ordinary passport booklets issued by its 28 member states share a common format ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passports_of_the_european_union )  [ european union citizenship is supplementary to national citizenship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_of_the_european_union ), 
  i do n't think you are meant to export less , but to import more . 
  the netherlands is not the only country with eurosceptics , just the only one that asked its citizens what they thought . 
  if we 'd had that vote we 'd probably have rejected it too . 
  eu member countries are not equivalent to us states . 
  it 's logical , not shameful . 
  the benefits of a second language are smaller for us than for citizens of other countries , because we already speak the most useful one . 
  if a us state goes bankrupt , the federal government will not bail them out - though there are large transfers to poorer states . 
   one can not be used for the other . 
  unless you stay beyond your travel visa and work illegally , which is hardly unheard of . 
  i guess they are just topics that are controversial , depicted with images . 
   `` temat zast\u0119pczy '' i think we call it the '' [ dead cat strategy ] ( http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2013/11/24/the-dead-cat-strategy-how-the-tories-hope-to-win-the-next-el ) '' in the uk . 
   yes because unless they make the stuff in belgium , that 's reality . 
  how ? 
  the cost of designing products in california is 100 % necessary for them to earn anything from belgium . 
  it might be more reasonable to calculate all their profit then divvy it up in proportion to revenue earnt per territory . 
  the syria crisis would be there , but we would n't have had everyone pouring into germany and sweden as the borders would have been shut to begin with . 
   if people want to vote about the relationship between the eu and the netherlands , let 's make it about that , not this indirect way . 
  that vote happened , and the european constitution was rejected - only for [ the same stuff ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/valeacutery-giscard-destaing-the-eu-treaty-is-the-same-as-the-constitution-398286.html ) to be pushed through anyway with the lisbon treaty . 
  yes , but people hiding from the government do n't fill them in . 
  the eurozone crisis and migration crisis would n't exist without the eu ( as there would be no schengen and no eurozone ) , so the eu is not blameless . 
  if you think an independent scotland would choose to join schengen and the eurozone post-brexit i think you will be disappointed - though i do n't think it will come to that . 
  you might be right , but how can we be sure it is n't the other way around ? 
  the snp are in favour of pr because they can never get a majority on their own so would benefit from more coalitions , even with fewer of their own mps . 
  yes - i guess that would count as `` positive action '' rather than `` positive discrimination '' , because it is not a proper job . 
   [ as a general rule , `` positive discrimination '' is prohibited in employment . 
  in contrast , `` positive action '' is permitted and may even be required in certain circumstances . 
  ] ( https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/positive-discrimination-and-positive-action/404799.article ) do n't ask me to explain how it works in practice though , lots of things seem to break the rules . 
  yes , but positive action is different to positive discrimination . 
   [ as a general rule , `` positive discrimination '' is prohibited in employment . 
  in contrast , `` positive action '' is permitted and may even be required in certain circumstances . 
  ] ( https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/positive-discrimination-and-positive-action/404799.article ), 
  i guess they are looking out for steel consumers rather than steel producers . 
  it might be a reference to [ his mosque being dubious ] ( http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/8710936.islamic_centre_hits_back_over_panorama_claims/ ) , rather than because his opponent is jewish . 
  positive discrimination/affirmative action is actually illegal in the uk . 
  that argument is n't going to change their minds - you have to convince them that abortion is n't murder . 
  for them the choice is between the awful prospect you describe and literal murder . 
  of course they think the former is better , even if they simultaneously think it is massively unfair . 
  i do n't think you can accuse them of hating women if they believe the choice is between literal murder and carrying an unwanted child . 
  whilst personally i 'd actually encourage rape victims to get abortions , i do n't think your criticism is fair . 
   the authority to shoot anyone in the head if they thought they were a terrorist about to blow themselves up if you think someone has a suicide vest on that they might activate that is the correct response . 
  the issue in this case is why the police thought that was the case . 
  a polling expert was quoted saying that a government 's preferred outcome gets 1.2 % less of the vote for each year the government has been in office . 
  that might have been one consideration , plus they wanted to avoid french and german elections . 
   one of the conclusions was that the sampling was not correct and that labour voters were overstated and conservative voters were understated . 
  at a guess , this would translate into an small overstatement of remain 's support . 
  i 'm not sure about that - they would n't be eligible for all of our opt outs . 
  i ca n't see a referendum passing in which one option would mean border controls with england and a commitment to adopt the euro . 
  consider that , and look at how close the polls are . 
  a good debate for leave could swing it . 
  corbyn and the new labour membership are definitely left wing , even if the vast majority of labour mps and voters are fairly centrist . 
  it does n't , but this was directed at the first comment rather than justifying the policy in general . 
  so this is a joke about the rwandan genocide ? 
  once an official leave campaign is designated we will see more concrete proposals - but as any negotiations/decisions will be made by the uk government and eu , both of whom are in favour of a remain vote , we will not see anything official . 
  annual net earnings ?

  funny to see the guardian criticising a group for following the law and not being racist . 
  the alternative is breaking the law on discrimination due to national origin . 
  it should n't filter other domains for france , it should block french people from those domains . 
  if it allows france to censor global search results , every other country in the world could demand the same . 
  i 'm referring to the global search results . 
  if france wants to censor the internet then only french people should have to put up with that . 
  the case appears to be an ahmadi muslim killed by a sunni muslim . 
  i guess he can consider estonia relatively poor because your average wage for a single person is still under $ 10,000 / year , whilst italy 's is over $ 20,000 . 
  i think the real impact would have been to scare people into voting for parties who promised to close it down , even if there was no real risk . 
  for joining a group committing genocide i think life in prison would be reasonable . 
   the problem is that jewish institutions are under constant attack from both right wing fascists and islamist . 
  i was under the impression that the far right had moved to being pro-jewish , at least over here .
