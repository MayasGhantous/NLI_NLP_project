  [ 4 % want more to 76 % wanting less ] ( http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/205573/immigration-bsa31.pdf ) . 
  over half of people want significantly less . 
  it is seen as a [ more important issue than the economy or unemployment ] ( http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3439/economistipsos-mori-august-2014-issues-index.aspx ) . 
  very low , but we do n't get to set those . 
  i was referring to legal tax dodging , like the dutch-irish-dutch scheme . 
  oh yes , but 12.5 % is still much lower than 23 % . 
  we have the second highest median wage in the eu after luxembourg , you have the hqs of tax dodging multinationals .

  also interesting to note that [ over 20 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_wales#place_of_birth ) of the population of wales was born in england, 
  and clara , if dr who 's the source of amelia . 
  i think if we left the eu it would start increasing its powers , as we are the only significant force stopping it from doing so already . 
  i think a very sizeable minority in the eu would hate that though , and might result in some serious issues leading to referenda . 
  polling suggests otherwise - thatcher is the [ most popular ] ( http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/12/06/prime-ministers-thatcher-best-brown-worst/ ) modern prime minister . 
  we probably would n't need visas . 
  we already have unlimited visa free travel to countries as varied as colombia and singapore , despite them not being in the eu - yet eu members such as sweden and the netherlands currently require one for stays of over 90 days . 
  having an alternative will force russia to cut what it is charging . 
  when the alternative is a blackout , you have to pay what you are told to . 
  it is interesting that you seem to think it is racists that need to be banned , rather than racism . 
  i 'm reading what he actually wrote , not trying to predict why he wrote it and then criticising him for that . 
  what are you on about ? 
  he did n't mention liberals , multiculturalism or diversity as the problem . 
  he suggested the problem was that a `` tolerance and diversity awareness course '' would be used as a solution , rather than arresting the criminals . 
   brown people you appear to be the one mentioning race , not him . 
  it 's not about me being happy so much as you not being wrong . 
  you ca n't call everything racist just because it is n't very nice , it weakens the meaning of the word . 
  actual racism needs to be stamped out , but criticism of sweden 's race relations policy should not be silenced . 
  if you think that criticism is wrong argue against it , do n't try and have it censored . 
  i do n't see either of those groups mentioned - never mind that neither of them is actually a race . 
  what absolute nonsense . 
  who is he supposedly being racist against ? 
  i 'm a londoner and have no idea . 
  it 's the rest of the uk that hates london , not the other way around . 
  but if assad 's brutality is a significant part of what fuels is , then it may be that you ca n't prevent the fighting without him stepping down . 
  non-genocidal rebels + assad faction + kurds in a federal lebanon-ised syria . 
  the carrot would be peace , money , safe exile in iran for assad , self-government for the various factions , no more genocide , and un troops to help kill is ; the stick would be air strikes , sanctions , sabotaging oil facilities , no-fly zones and having to deal with is . 
  i think that is possibly what the many diplomats are currently working on . 
  a disaster in catalonia might swing scottish/british voters who are unsure about the actual risks of leaving the uk/eu . 
  one argument i heard in the scottish referendum was that scotland would n't have to leave the eu , but if catalonia does then that would look like a lie . 
  a messy divorce is probably the ideal scenario for those who do n't want scotland to leave the uk ( or the uk to leave the eu ) . 
  i 'm just saying we probably should n't back assad , not that we should invade . 
  officially it is for the catalan parliament , but as spain has forbidden an independence referendum the separatist parties have described it as a vote on independence , which they will push for if they get a majority . 
  the primary reason islamic state and the other islamist militias exist seems to be because sunni arabs disliked their fairly oppressive shi'ite arab rulers . 
  i ca n't see that changing with assad still in charge . 
  how many seats for independence , and what share of the vote against ( assuming some were invalid ) ? 
  if you ca n't make him see sense then maybe try one of these : http://www.euronews.com/2015/09/27/migrants-a-key-factor-as-far-right-makes-gains-in-austria/ or http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=73406, 
  is upper austria a particularly strong area for them ? 
   assad is a massive cunt , but he is without a doubt better than isil . 
  islamic state probably have worse intentions , but given how badly he 's been bombing rebel areas he has probably killed more than they have . 
  apparently the [ preliminary results ] ( http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09au/dau09999cm_l4.htm ) should be out around 9pm , as the voting ends at 7pm ( both london time ) . 
  good chorus , the rest is n't so memorable . 
  most minority languages look massively over-drawn , i 'm not sure why catalan is the opposite . 
   accept those who are in need , i think almost everyone wants to help those in need , but some people have a different definition of `` help '' and `` need '' to others . 
  `` help '' could be funding camps in turkey or settling migrants , whilst `` need '' could be limited to those in war zones , or extended to anyone with citizenship from a country that is a war zone . 
  the left could be considered to be everything to the left of the centre , and thereby include the centre-left . 
  i guess that view is more common the further to the right you are . 
  you can [ legally rape your wife in many muslim countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marital_rape#countries_where_spousal_rape_is_not_a_criminal_offence ) , they are probably not more enlightened in islamic state . 
   undecided voters tend to favor the status quo in my experience . 
  you are right , but many people do n't believe the status quo is on offer - the eu will continuously push for ever greater powers . 
  they might want a lot less eu but prefer to remain in because of potential risks to the economy . 
  why does the french government think french asylum policy is up to them any more ? 
  with no op-out , they need treaty change to be able to promise anything at all on that front . 
  we can follow their plan without electing them - the referendum will happen even though they only have 1 mp . 
  hungary is right to build the fence with countries that are n't controlling their borders , but that was still quite funny . 
  if he died in office we 'd have pm watson , would n't we ? 
  he also wants a united ireland , unlike the northern irish . 
  currently we only have someone who dislikes cameron claiming an anonymous source told him this happened . 
  it 's fairly safe to assume it is fake until some more evidence comes to light . 
   despite huge increments in productivity , the salaries have increased ever so little . 
  that 's true here , but they have increased a lot globally . 
  there 's no data for the uk ; i 'd imagine england would decrease that number quite a bit . 
  if safety was the concern you 'd stay in turkey or greece . 
  i just looked up the numbers , and london residential property alone is worth [ $ 2.26 trillion ] ( http://www.cityam.com/206949/uk-house-prices-total-value-uk-property-hits-58tn ) !, 
  the numbers may well be real - the media is almost entirely controlled by the kremlin , and the opposition are heavily suppressed . 
  what are people supposedly jealous of ? 
  are there any statistics on where asylum seekers came from before entering the eu , rather than from where they originated ? 
  we declared war on germany as we did n't want half of europe united under the nazis . 
  the bad thing would have been not fighting in wwii . 
  scotland could leave the eu by leaving the uk , or the uk could leave the eu directly . 
  there is also the greek economy being bust , the upcoming implementation of the swiss anti-migration referendum that might invalidate their bilateral agreements , several eu states obliged to but refusing to implement the euro , romania and bulgaria being prevented from joining schengen , the rise of anti-eu parties all over europe , several countries refusing to follow echr judgements ( such as the uk over prisoner voting rights ) and i 'm sure several more that i 've missed . 
  it should be '' [ they 'd 've ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/they%27d%27ve ) had '' , which is how people say `` they would have had '' / `` they 'd have had '' / `` they would 've had '' , but you would n't normally use a double contraction when writing . 
  much of their potential ability to undercut you through having fewer rights and environmental controls , a large amount of their workforce who will move for higher wages , and eventually the ability to devalue their currency in order to undercut your prices . 
  germany does n't give those funds out of charity , they are in return for things like unrestricted market access . 
   i really have to ask why you 're in the eu in the first place , if you apparently reject everything it stands for . 
  what else were you referring to them rejecting then ? 
  the government welcomed it , the public did not . 
  there has been a [ majority wanting less immigration ] ( http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/205573/immigration-bsa31.pdf ) since the surveys began . 
  what nonsense . 
  if `` everything the eu stands for '' is refugee quotas then the eu does n't stand for anything , given such a quota does not currently exist . 
  many of those economic migrants paying tax will still be a net cost - given [ a majority of the population as a whole ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13633966 ) are too . 
  when people propose otherwise it gets labelled as `` social cleansing '' and the places they would end up instead get angry at having people they do n't want dumped on them . 
  you 'd have thought not , but you do see these stories quite often : - [ # 1.8 m ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/news/benefits-rules-to-change-after-former-asylum-seeker-gets-18million-home-6739478.html ) - [ # 2.1 m ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7883944/former-asylum-seeker-on-benefits-given-2-million-house.html ) most wo n't be this bad , but we do pay to house lots of people in london at exorbitant rates . 
   housing and immediate clothing are cheap and easy to provide . 
  clothing for a lifetime is relatively cheap , but housing is very expensive here - the average house in the uk is $ 250,000 , rising to over $ 650,000 in london . 
  the uk already spends close to $ 35 billion a year on subsidising housing costs . 
  no party represents the majority of danes though , and some parties are evidently close enough to df to be willing to work with them in order to form a government . 
  if that was n't accepted by danes then those parties would n't do it as it would cost them too many votes . 
  df are n't rigging elections , it 's the danish voters whose values are changing . 
  unless it is very close - which it could well be - both scotland and the rest of the uk will probably have voted the same way . 
  [ opinions are n't hugely different either side of the border .
