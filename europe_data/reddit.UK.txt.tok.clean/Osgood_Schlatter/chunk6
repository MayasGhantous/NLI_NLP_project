   of course we were also told the best way to stay in the eu was to vote no . 
  [ that is because the only way to stay in the eu was to vote no . 
  ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/eu-warns-catalonia-independence-means-leaving-bloc-141820823.html ), 
  not yet !, 
  ireland is n't in schengen , but scotland would have to join as it is a condition of membership . 
   a spokesman for the turkish prime minister 's office categorically denied that any syrian would be returned to syria until there is solid evidence to the contrary , this is n't really a story . 
  i think many of the rebels left and set up a new party . 
  there 's a 50 seat bonus for first , then the remaining seats are divided amongst every party getting above 3 % . 
  to get a guaranteed majority you would need 40 % of the vote , though you could probably manage with a bit less ( about 36.5 % ? ), 
  due to the parties with under 3 % not being represented . 
  most predictions i can see ( 30-34 % ) would not give syriza a majority . 
  my mistake , was still thinking about canada . 
  could you see something like the partition of ireland happening if part of catalonia voted no but the rest voted yes ? 
  it was apparently considered with pro-canadian native tribes in quebec . 
  i think scotland and quebec both had a small majority in favour of independence if you only look at those of the electorate who were born there . 
  has the spanish ~ ~ federal ~ ~ central government done much to promote immigration to catalonia to try to counter the risk of independence ? 
   yet somehow the country is n't in danger of falling apart . 
  it is n't currently , but it was as little as 20 years ago - when 49.5 % of quebec voted in favour of leaving . 
  orthodox priests can marry , ca n't they ? 
  that might explain why priest is so much more common in the balkans than in western europe . 
  could be dyta ryta at a push . 
  they do - the four teams over here ( england , ireland , scotland , wales ) pre-date irish independence , and other than for football they have mostly stayed the same . 
   who creates an open border zone , consisting of some of the richest countries in the world , without making sure that there is a functional outer border ? 
  people that support huge amounts of non-eu migration ? 
  you can have austrian citizenship whilst also being an arab muslim, 
  we 'll see that in practice when the successful swiss referendum to limit migration kicks in in 2017 . http://lenews.ch/2015/03/17/swiss-immigration-vote-re-run/, 
  the quota does n't propose removing any people from slovenia , only giving them more from hungary , italy and greece . 
  that 's actually lower than i was expecting , given i know the uk spends [ ~ $ 18.5 billion ] ( http://www.theweek.co.uk/refugee-crisis/63394/foreign-aid-how-does-britain-spend-its-overseas-aid-budget ) a year in foreign aid . 
  we only have a duty to accept refugees fleeing danger , not illiteracy . 
  there could be hundreds of millions of people arriving if we accepted the latter . 
  is that feasible ? 
  croatia has a very long border for its size . 
  this could be big news in scotland . 
   refugees entering via another eu state under dublin regulations will not recieve any benefits , just a train ticket and some food . 
  what is the train ticket for ? 
   if you 're in the eu you are also in the monetary union . 
  if you want to stay in the eu for the benefits but want to avoid the monetary union because you think it 's harmful to your national interest you are a parasite member . 
  you 'd better kick out the uk , denmark , sweden and the czech republic too then . 
   most probably countries would agree to turn a blind eye to that but this sets dangerous precedence . 
  surely sweden is the precedent ? 
  the `` eyes of nature '' do n't matter , it is human eyes that need to make that decision . 
  time for a new account - your cover is blown , dave !, 
  i know the demographics are split , but the opinion on uk/ireland is not . 
  [ protestants/unionists back the uk overwhelmingly , whilst catholics/nationalists also slightly favour the status quo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_ireland#in_northern_ireland ) . 
  reunification as part of the uk would probably bring economic benefits to both sides too , but that does n't mean it will or should happen . 
  i disagree , the ipsos-mori polls show the same thing . 
  here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_ireland#in_northern_ireland even catholics are 38/35 in favour of the uk over unification with the rest of ireland . 
  i think wanting a united ireland is ridiculous , given 65 % of people in ni want to stay in the uk versus only 20 % who want unification . 
  the fact that they repeatedly invite him back suggests his views align with the interests of the kremlin . 
   but rt will draw some comfort from the election of jeremy corbyn as leader of the labour party . 
  mr corbyn has in the past expressed approval of rt and has made numerous appearances on the channel . 
  he makes it very hard ~ ~ not ~ ~ to trust him on foreign policy . 
  the danish government i guess ? 
  our international aid budget was increased to its current level in 2010 , not just in response to the recent migration crisis . 
  in an ideal world everyone would , but as resources are limited that is not desirable for those who are lucky enough to be born in the west . 
  the only time i 've seen them is on a small number of armed police near high-priority targets in central london . 
  the longer that stays true the better . 
  a high-pitched beeping sound, 
  terrified of what ? 
  canada , australia and new zealand manage to run themselves just fine , i 'm sure we can too . 
  the usa did n't have nuclear weapons in 1941 , declaring war on them did n't risk ending civilisation . 
  d'clauzel did n't sticky it , another mod did as a joke to wind up the sub . 
  i think the mod that stickied it is having a laugh rather than being serious . 
  on the other hand it is socially acceptable to go to a pro-immigration protest , but socially unacceptable to go to an anti-immigration one - even though public opinion ( at least here ) is largely anti-immigration . 
  there is [ overwhelming support ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/09/08/public-approval-syria-drone-attacks/ ) for drone strikes on british citizens fighting for isis in syria ( 66:11 in favour ) , so i 'd say people are roughly in line with cameron 's policy of bombing people but not invading them . 
  corbyn and blair are the two extremes that public opinion is somewhere between . 
  it does n't matter a huge amount given most wo n't be british citizens . 
  you do n't have to hold them both to the same standard to realise they both deserve to be condemned for what happened . 
  both sides had far too much blood on their hands . 
  he voted to leave in our previous eu referendum , but has n't come down on either side this time . 
  there are elections of some sort [ every year from now until 2020 ] ( http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/upcoming-elections-and-referendums ) ( plus the eu referendum in 2017 ) , each one labour does well in should protect his position until the next one - i think mps will otherwise be reluctant to challenge him , given how emphatically he won the leadership contest . 
  winning london * and * preventing an snp majority in 2016 would be quite an achievement , given how unlikely it currently looks . 
  different sure , but never a majority for unification . 
  what about article 31 ? 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened ** in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  a voters of every party back nato by at least 2:1 . http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/1hdxa38zho/internalresults_140801_nato_w.pdf, 
   [ `` the fundamental right to asylum for the politically persecuted knows no upper limit ; that also goes for refugees who come to us from the hell of a civil war . 
  '' ] ( http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/09/10/the-latest-danish-police-let-migrants-go-on-to-sweden ) i ca n't see why any of the four million syrians in refugee camps in turkey , lebanon or jordan would not want to come to germany after hearing that . 
  are you comparing palestine to northern ireland ? 
  that is ridiculous . 
  [ polling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_ireland#in_northern_ireland ) shows 65 % of people in northern ireland want to be part of the uk versus 20 % supporting irish unification . 
  are n't there bridges in istanbul you can use if you need to get to europe ? 
  he condemns the british army 's role in northern ireland ( fair enough ) but wo n't do the same for the ira . 
  better cross your fingers he does n't win if your country is near russia :  [ corbyn even suggests it was wrong to allow countries such as poland , as a former member of the warsaw pact in the soviet orbit , to join nato . 
  asked whether it was a mistake to admit former warsaw pact countries , he says : `` i think it probably was , actually . 
  we ** should have gone down the road ukraine went down in 1990 ** , which was an informal agreement with russia that ukraine would be a non-nuclear state and would be non-aligned in its foreign policy . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-interview-we-are-not-doing-celebrity-personality-or-abusive-politics ), 
  not exactly the same , but we do have two welsh teams in the english league and an english team in the scottish league . 
  you mean an american billion - the traditional english billion is 10 ^ 12 too . 
   [ in british english , a billion used to be equivalent to a million million ( i.e. 
  1,000,000,000,000 ) , while in american english it has always equated to a thousand million ( i.e. 
  british english has now adopted the american figure , though , so that a billion equals a thousand million in both varieties of english . 
  ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/how-many-is-a-billion ), 
  i wonder if the migration crisis will noticeably lower german numbers - a lot more people , but not as much extra gdp . 
  dublin does n't cover quotas . 
  it may not work well but that is how it currently operates . 
  some may prefer to end schengen than to lose control over asylum/refugee policy . 
  if they were the same thing then denmark could n't have an opt out of eu asylum policy , but they do . 
  there are no borders between the uk and ireland either , but that does n't mean we get a say in who they grant refugee status to . 
  schengen is open borders , not a common asylum policy .
