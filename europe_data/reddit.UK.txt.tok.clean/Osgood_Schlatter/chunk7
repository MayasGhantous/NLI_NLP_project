  they are n't the same thing - denmark is in the former but not the latter . 
  you vote for a candidate from a party , not for individual issues . 
  there is currently [ an anti-immigration party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finns_party ) in the coalition government . 
  they do have elections , which is how these things are usually decided . 
  why would you even need to pay a smuggler any more ? 
  everyone has to be allowed into the eu to have their case for asylum considered , and every country en route will let you through so long as you do n't linger . 
  no , this ruling is about travelling from home to your first client and from you last client back home . 
   `` employers may have to organise work schedules to ensure workers first and last appointments are close to their homes , '' he added . 
  they appear to be polling just under 30 % , putting them in first place . 
  what about germany and japan ? 
  some of these things seemed designed to fail , in order to force through greater integration that would otherwise be rejected . 
  you set up a positive sounding scheme which requires minimal loss of sovereignty , but is destined to eventually reach a crisis . 
  measures to prevent that crisis would be so unpopular as to put many potential members off joining in the first place . 
  when the crisis eventually does hit , the only option is to enact those unpopular measures as everyone is already heavily invested in the scheme . 
  that 's how free movement is turning into a loss of control over non-eu migration/asylum policy , a common currency is becoming fiscal transfers/eu control of national budgets and so on . 
  if we were outside of the eu , there is no way we 'd pass a referendum to join it , and i do n't think we are alone in that regard . 
  not really - there were fewer than 75,000 non-white people in the uk in 1951 , according to a bbc article i read today . 
   are we now living in a time and age where countries are no longer allowed to keep out the foreigners they do n't want ? 
  yes , it would breach various rules that you have to obey to be in the eu . 
  italy [ got fined ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/court-fines-italy-for-deporting-migrants-to-libya/a-15761455 ) for doing that in the past . 
  the only official language in any part of the uk is welsh , though it has fewer speakers in the uk than polish . 
  we are n't the primary cause of the fighting - one side is up in arms against oppressive shi'ite governments , the other is fighting against destructive sunni rebels . 
  sorry , i thought their pm had said they would n't oppose if a majority of europe was in favour . 
  i think lithuania and slovakia might not oppose , but spain might . 
  in [ this interview ] ( http://www.expressen.se/administration/thomas-mattsson-chattade-om-kriminaljournalistik/ ) with the editor of a swedish newspaper , he says they have not carried out `` vitpixling '' ( pixellating criminals then re-colouring them to look white ) since 2009 - which suggests that is what they did before 2009 . 
  the definition of yankee is only limited geographically in american english , everyone else uses yankee to mean any american . 
   [ definition of yankee in english ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/yankee?q=yankee ) :  noun  informal  1 . 
  * often derogatory * an american . 
  * us * an inhabitant of new england or one of the northern states . 
  we 've got an opt-out , along with denmark and ireland . 
   well , signing up to join eu is not just signing up to receive benefits from eu , it is also signing up to share responsibilities . 
  those benefits and responsibilities were listed in the treaties , and refugee quotas were not on that list . 
  there is no such thing under uk law , but nobody has suggested the result could be ignored . 
  he 's saying it was n't a coincidence , otherwise he 'd have put `` no way , that number plate was a coincidence '' . 
  we are n't actually at war with syria though , unlike israel . 
  we do n't know either way with libya , it was n't all sunshine and roses before we intervened . 
  comparing people who want significantly less immigration to racist fascists should be avoided because it just devalues the impact of such an accusation . 
  if i was like mosley i would n't be saying :  a year before that was written the usa passed the chinese exclusion act banning chinese immigration , and 7 years later saw the `` separate but equal '' doctrine that made non-white americans second class citizens . 
  i 'd rather not follow the usa on this one . 
  or  nazi-style `` blood purity '' nonsense or  jewish schools needs security because they are a target for islamist extremists . 
  i was just listing those policies as examples of him definitely being left wing rather than right wing , not because they are all bonkers . 
  the situation for poor people in america is n't ideal either . 
  '' ! 111 '' means he is n't being serious . 
  he 's in favour of nationalisation without compensation , maximum wages , unilateral disarmament , immigration and tax-and-spend policies . 
  he 's got some of the nonsense you see on both fringes , but he 's definitely not right wing . 
  a year before that was written the usa passed the chinese exclusion act banning chinese immigration , and 7 years later saw the `` separate but equal '' doctrine that made non-white americans second class citizens . 
  i 'd rather not follow the usa on this one . 
  we 'll oppose a tax that hits us the hardest even if we vote to stay . 
   i 'm still waiting until one of the countries that want to help them where they are , actually starts to help them where they are . 
  we 've spent close to # 1,000,000,000 on syrian refugee camps , and we 're bombing isis in iraq . 
   when ~ ~ scotland ~ ~ ** the snp ** tried to go independent . 
  scotland did n't * try * to go independent , there was a vote and everything and they decided they did n't want to . 
  the second most voted post this week was about there being too many donations to refugees . 
  the top two comments were about how proud germans were about their country . 
  no , there was no financial reward for that . 
  `` do not have enough staff '' is almost always code for `` do not have enough staff willing to work for the wages they are offering '' . 
   czechs themselves are not interested in the jobs here , preferring similar , but better-paid work further to the west ,, 
  maybe it should be sub-divided rather than ended if you do decide it is n't working . 
  there are no problems with the common travel area between the uk and ireland , possibly because we have similar wealth , immigration policies and so on . 
  schengen is n't the same thing as freedom of movement , as we have the latter without the former . 
  we still look pretty good - more than the un target , and almost twice as much as germany . 
  the idea should be reducing the number in lesbos , not increasing it everywhere else . 
   and because the journey is so dangerous , now german leftist politicians are suggesting to allow anyone to fly to germany without a visa and apply for asylum at the airport . 
  this is unparalleled madness . 
  is that in conjunction with denying all applications from people that take the dangerous land/sea routes ? 
  if so it would at least be coherent . 
  it would appear there simply is n't a significant non-white population in hungary to be racist against . 
  watch the video , around 2:15 . 
  the bbc charter is meant to force them to be impartial and balanced . 
  nato is n't going anywhere . 
  because those countries at some point threatened to block a treaty change , which needs unanimous support . 
  denmark had rejected the maastricht treaty in a referendum , so got four big opt-outs in the edinburgh agreement in order to get a second referendum to pass . 
  the article has a point , but be aware this is a spoof news site . 
  other articles include : - [ `` queen can kill a man with one finger '' ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/celebrity/queen-can-kill-a-man-with-one-finger-20150818101232 ) - [ `` darth vader is a baptist , says vatican '' ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/science-technology/darth-vader-is-a-baptist-says-vatican-20080515953 ) - [ `` eu vote will include option to restart ww2 '' ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/international/eu-vote-will-include-option-to-restart-ww2-20150902101639 ) - [ `` countries whose names do n't work with ' - exit ' barred from leaving eu '' ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/international/countries-whose-names-dont-work-with-exit-barred-from-leaving-eu-2015061199125 ), 
  i think i do know what you are talking about - you appear to be debating a fake quote from this spoof news article because you think it is real ... 
  maybe not , as we have an opt-out on asylum policy along with ireland and denmark . 
   here david cameron is saying we wo n't let more than 1,000 in . 
  we granted 14,000 people asylum last year , i do n't think he 's said we 'd be cutting that significantly . 
  you do realise this is a spoof news site ? 
  martin bishop is n't real . 
   [ about the daily mash ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/about )  the daily mash is a satirical website which publishes spoof articles , i.e. 
  it is all made-up and is not intended , in any way whatsoever , to be taken as factual . 
  glad we 've got that sorted . 
  no , as in they are sad about what is happening to greece . 
   refugees who are under threat of death if they stay . 
  other than some north africans , nobody arriving in the eu by land or sea fits that definition , as no other neighbouring states are war zones . 
  they ( well , labour voters ) are very concerned about immigration too . 
  [ it 's the top issue for voters of both major parties ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3614/economistipsos-mori-august-2015-issues-index.aspx ) , but much higher for conservative voters . 
  polling only had [ 4 % wanting more immigration versus 77 % wanting less ] ( http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/205573/immigration-bsa31.pdf ) , with a significant majority of every party wanting less , so it 's not like anyone is particularly pro-immigration . 
  our foreign aid budget is ~ 30 % larger than germany 's , despite our gdp being ~ 30 % smaller . 
  we 're not lagging behind on that count . 
  i passed through the same controls to travel to belgium as to south africa , visa-free travel is n't exclusive to the eu . 
  greece for the left , calais for the right and centre ? 
  it does n't matter how many turkey takes , that does n't make it a war zone . 
  whilst we should n't have invaded iraq , we ca n't know how bloody it would have been under sadam - his actions had already killed plenty of kurds , kuwaitis , shi'ite iraqis and iranians . 
  nobody arriving in greece is fleeing war , because there is no war in turkey . 
  we should be deporting undocumented migrants back to the last safe country they passed through , then providing aid to those safe countries to help them deal with the burden . 
  the only refugees in austria should be those austria has offered asylum to whilst they are in those neighbouring safe countries . 
  that way nobody has an incentive to risk their life crossing the mediterranean , and austria does n't get more refugees than it decides it can cope with . 
  that 's an almost impossible demand in the current climate .
