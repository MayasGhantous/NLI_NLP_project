  concern over immigration has [ never been higher ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3614/economistipsos-mori-august-2015-issues-index.aspx ) , and it is significantly ahead of any other issue . 
  the percentage of people calling it the most important issue is equal to those listing the next four topics combined ( the economy , the nhs , inequality/poverty and unemployment ) . 
  how do you get to hungary in the first place without `` asylum shopping '' ? 
  unless you 're a ukrainian you 've already passed though a safe country to get there . 
  i thought international law only says you have to accept people who come directly from the place they are fleeing ? 
  you could refuse pretty much everyone , as they come from serbia and romania . 
   the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened ** in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence, 
  unlikely , given what we saw with quebec and scotland . 
  they 'll push for more concessions and the implementation of those promised in the renegotiation , whilst campaigning against further integration . 
  exactly - why would they agree to surrender funds they are already receiving ? 
   one could consider allocating more money from eu structural funds to those member states who react accordingly to the refugee situation what would the eastern member states gain from this proposal ? 
  they are getting the structural funds anyway , without having to take in large numbers of unwanted migrants . 
   europe is love europe is life somehow i do n't think he was being entirely serious ... 
  is n't that sort of dependent on them '' [ coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/419c778d4.html ) '' ( article 31 of the geneva convention ) , which is probably quite a small minority of people who reach the eu , bar some libyans . 
  the cohesion funds have already been agreed upon . 
  you ca n't use them as a bargaining chip every time you want eastern europe to do you a favour . 
  i 'd be more surprised if nobody died , given this covers over 100,000 people . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3iyf1v/un_investigating_british_government_over_human/cukzzxa ) one analysis from / r/unitedkingdom that explains it in more depth . 
  unemployment benefits are nothing compared to in work benefits such as housing benefit . 
  most people here do n't like it - over three quarters want immigration reduced ( versus 3 % increased ) whilst just over half want it stopped entirely for two years . 
  she 's 9:1 on being next pm . 
  a refugee is fleeing danger , not a lack of work or `` solidarity '' . 
  if you enter iran or turkey your journey should end there . 
  i do n't think that us cities * are * running out of water - from what i 've seen , it 's the farmers that use most of it . 
  i meant we should only be accepting people directly fleeing the north african coast , europe , russia or turkey . 
  for example , libyans should be welcome , but syrians returned to safety in turkey . 
  should n't censorship should be up to a judge rather than the government ? 
  i would n't want our government ministers to be demanding posts be removed from facebook . 
  hungary borders austria , so this is n't comparable to the current situation . 
  the geneva convention ( article 31 ) says :  [ 1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened ** in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence .

   they 're hiding in trucks to get in !, 
  no , the truck set off from hungary . 
   [ the lorry set off from budapest in the early hours of wednesday morning , and reached the hungarian-austrian border by 9am . 
  it crossed into austria that night and was spotted on the a4 at 5am or 6am on thursday , police said . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/28/more-than-70-dead-austria-migrant-truck-tragedy ), 
  why would a pan-european party be able to tackle tax havens ? 
  every eu member has a veto on new eu taxes . 
  i think wealth is n't about what you earn , it 's about what you have . 
  all else being equal , if i make $ 10/year and own my house outright , i am technically wealthier than the person who makes $ 100,000 / year but has a large mortgage . 
  what makes you say that ? 
  plenty of economic migrants risk their lives to travel illegally from france to the uk . 
   provide refugees with a legal and safe way to seek asylum in the eu and the trafficking will most likely stop . 
  they were already in the eu when they got into the truck , were n't they ? 
  we 'll be receiving a lot of sweden 's refugees in 4 years , when they get their swedish passports . 
   [ indeed , we met so many nigerians from germany , or somalis from denmark , that we asked oxford university 's migration observatory to crunch the numbers on how many eu migrants are not originally from europe . 
  they found that 141,000 people , 7 % of those who came to the uk under eu rules were born outside the continent . 
  somalis are one of the biggest such groups , with an estimated 20,000 coming to the uk from the netherlands alone . 
  studies show that between one third and a half of the entire dutch somali community has moved to the uk . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/28/british-dream-europe-african-citizens ), 
   do you normally generalize all white people as drunks ? 
  we do here , especially scottish and irish people . 
   migrants and refugees often travel in the same way but migrants choose to leave their country for reasons not related to persecution . 
  why does this article try to redefine the word migrant ? 
  it 's anyone who migrates , the reason for that migration is irrelevant . 
  there are no boats leaving syria and landing in europe - they are leaving the north african coast and turkey . 
  austria , denmark , luxembourg and the netherlands all had more asylum applications per capita than italy last year . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/aug/20/asylum-seekers-eu-comparison-germany-datablog the uk also received a higher absolute number than italy last year : http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/77922000/gif/_77922434_where_applicants_go_20140916_624.gif, 
  it 'd be quicker to list who is n't being taken to court : austria , croatia , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , luxembourg , the netherlands , romania , slovakia and the uk, 
  no , currently it appears the echr decides . 
  i 've seen italians say that italy got fined for not being as generous as they are currently . 
  one problem with co-ordination is you end with one size fitting nobody . 
  a common policy would not be as generous as those calling for it would like , but would be too generous for those who oppose it . 
  no , the minimum criteria will consider the rights of the individual rather than just what helps the society . 
  the european convention of human rights applies to everyone , even those who are not integrated and are detrimental to society . 
  i was taking issue with / u/thelamogio suggesting no syrians admitted as refugees will be islamist extremists . 
  i did n't suggest getting rid of anyone . 
  guernsey is there , the british isles do n't appear to be getting special protection . 
  the wwi belgian refugees all returned , it is n't impossible . 
  unlikely . 
  we 've never stopped our funding , despite frequent disagreements with the eu . 
  that 's a separate argument though - one for which the solution could be giving lots of money to turkey , lebanon et al to help them cope . 
  gross legal immigration is 641,000 a year , nobody knows what the number of illegal immigrants is . 
  the last death from an adder bite in the uk was a 5 year old in 1975 . 
   germany despite the polls claiming the majority of the public support more asylum seekers . 
  the polls do n't say that , the number was ~ 40 % less , ~ 35 % the same , ~ 25 % more , but the headline read '' ~ 60 % want more or the same '' . 
  how do you distinguish a someone running from is from someone who is broadly supportive of is but prefers to live in germany ? 
  you might want to deport those who do n't integrate but meet the minimum criteria anyway . 
  he wo n't do it . 
  the polls have immigration as a bigger concern than ever before , with 50 % listing it as a top concern . 
  corbyn is pro-immigration , and the conservatives will use it to crucify him whilst uniting their party despite splits on the eu . 
  i think part of the issue is that turkey , egypt and others are not in civil wars , yet syrians who have travelled via those countries are not returned to them . 
  this will push more people to try and get through italy and greece , not fewer . 
  rather than 57 % same or more versus 38 % fewer , it is 23 % more , 34 % same , 38 % fewer . 
  would it have been berlin ? 
  the numbers make it appear that is somewhat close to how it operates - most failed asylum seekers manage to avoid deportation . 
  you ca n't send someone somewhere without very strong evidence as they 'll just appeal , or the country you are trying to send them to will just refuse to take them . 
   [ between them , seven countries -- or one-quarter of the eu -- fielded more than three-quarters of asylum applications . 
  most fail . 
  but although 425,000 claims were denied in 2013 , ** less than 40 % of those failures resulted in deportation . 
  ** ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/mediterranean-migrant-crisis-no-european-migration-policy ), 
   you get deported if you 're not deemed to be a refugee . 
  not if you refuse to tell them where you are from . 
  that 's partly due to simple numbers - south asians make up about 5 % of the population , versus < 1 % for east asians . 
   how many of these people are actually fleeing from isis in syria or iraq ? 
  unless isis are active in greece now , none . 
  violent extremists are n't trying to convince others they are right , they are trying to make it more costly to disagree with them . 
  this post should n't be here regardless of whether or not there is a megathread . 
  i 'd prefer a filter as a compromise , like the one in / r/worldnews .
