  i would n't do it in public in case someone got the wrong idea , but in private it would probably be fine ( though maybe not in northern ireland , but i 'm no expert ) . 
  we had lots of ira bombings in the past , people did n't freak out . 
  i can see [ 37 listed for 1992 in london alone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_terrorist_incidents_in_london#irish_republican_attacks_during_.22the_troubles.22 ) . 
  they even bombed the hotel the pm was staying in , and launched a mortar attack on the pm 's official residence . 
  it was n't just that they killed one of our citizens :  [ thousands of britons and tourists were put at risk from radiation following the poisoning of russian spy alexander litvinenko , an inquiry into his death has heard .

  the uk is spending 0.71 % of gdp on foreign aid versus 0.36 % for france , we 're not doing nothing . 
  i think some people want assimilation rather than integration , and the current rate of immigration will make that very difficult . 
  hopefully the people posting here are n't actually calling for nazi-style `` blood purity '' nonsense , but it could be read that way . 
   germany is in need of an immigration act what does that mean ? 
  lots of people are coming from safe zones - like syrians through turkey . 
   so i guess they should cancel the treaties they have with eu . 
  that 's coming in in 2017 , is n't it ? 
  is nobody hired to empty your bins , wait on your tables , sweep your streets , stack your supermarket shelves and so on ? 
   well the laws can be changed , only in theory . 
  in practice there is only `` ever closer union '' . 
  i ca n't think of any powers that have returned to the national parliaments after having gone to the eu - though i 'm open to correction . 
   so why do n't the eu arrest illegal immigrants ? 
  if you arrest someone they are stuck in your country whilst you spend a lot of money keeping them in jail . 
  if you do n't , they might keep moving towards london , munich or malmo . 
  yes , though the parts of ukraine near hungary are safe at the moment . 
  if the war reached western ukraine then the eu would have the responsibility to accept large numbers of ukrainians . 
   they could be travelling to hungary via land routes there is no land route between hungary and asia or africa that does n't first pass through somewhere safe . 
  why does the article call it a `` nazi train '' rather than a german one ? 
  trains do n't have a political affiliation . 
  it 'd make it easier to prevent the mistake of referring to things like this as polish . 
  a refugee is :  fleeing an armed conflict or facing persecution based on their ethnicity , religion , or another protected category . 
  if you are entering hungary from serbia or romania you are therefore not a refugee , as those countries are safe . 
  it 's not surprising , given england recently overtook the netherlands to be the second most densely populated eu country after malta ( we now have 411 people / km ^ 2 ) . 
  that 's a fair point . 
  to be honest , i do n't think economics would have determined it anyway - much like in the eurozone , it would be politics that determined the response rather than the optimal economic solution . 
  i think the ruk electorate would have been very bitter , and would have forced the ruk to refuse a currency union even if it was in our interest . 
  the lack of someone to represent england in any discussion meant nobody could say that though , as our only representatives are shared with the rest of the uk so ca n't argue solely in england 's interest . 
   scotland and ruk have extremely well aligned economies . 
  what about the impact of oil ? 
  at the time of the referendum it made up [ 10-20 % of scotland 's revenue , compared to 1.5 % of the uk 's ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24866266 ) . 
  cheap oil would be good for the ruk , but very bad for iscotland . 
  when iscotland needed the currency to act one way , the ruk would want it to act the other . 
   so does that mean , since oil is unlikely to go back over $ 100 pb , english tax payers are footing the bill ? 
  it 's the south that runs a surplus , not england as a whole . 
  the north east was running an even bigger deficit than scotland in the last figures i saw . 
  interestingly , the population density of the lake district national park is [ 18.4 / km ^ 2 ] ( http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/factsandfigures ) , which is higher than that of finland , at [ 17.9 / km ^ 2 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/finland/population-density-people-per-sq-km-wb-data.html ) . 
  does n't almost every economist say that a currency union needs a political and fiscal union - which is why the eurozone is in trouble ? 
  how would that work if the ruk has 92 % of the vote on any decisions ? 
  how would you envisage splitting the bank of england ? 
  i see it as an indivisible asset , like the houses of parliament or holyrood . 
  the debt , the foreign exchange reserves , military equipment etc is divisible , so that is what i 'd expect to be split up if part of the uk seceded . 
  maybe that is the aim ? 
  neutralise domestic criticism for not taking any refugees by blaming it on the eu . 
  the uk will be on their side , not yours . 
  our preferred solution is foreign aid and fences . 
  it wo n't accept any then , as you are n't allowed to do that as a member of the eu . 
  a credit card that the snp threatened to walk away from . . http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28943041 . 
  how are you going to prove it one way or the other ? 
  i doubt the eu will allow it anyway :  eu commission spokeswoman annika breithard said she could not comment directly on the slovak statement , but stressed that eu states were banned from any form of discrimination . 
  we 're struggling to fund one military , let alone two . 
  there is no way we would give another country a veto on protecting , say , the falklands . 
   client states protected by the superpower and following its command like how france was forced to invade iraq ? 
  we are not client states , nor forced to follow the us . 
  it is just often in our interest to do so . 
  good luck punishing us when we refuse , we are already the second biggest net contributor . 
  you might instead have a compulsory levy on cds to `` compensate '' copyright holders . 
  people have been more concerned about immigration than the economy ( [ or any other issue ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3608/economistipsos-mori-july-2015-issues-index.aspx ) ) for several years now . 
  the post was talking about extremism by brits - and the ira would be the first to tell you they were not british . 
  the cd ripping was the uk government being overruled by the eu copyright directive . 
  morocco is safe - the alternatives are living in morocco or the eu , not life or death . 
  the phrase he used was '' [ swarm of people ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33716501 ) '' , not just `` swarm '' . 
  you do n't refer to a group you are trying to dehumanise as people . 
   refugee means `` threatened by war or persecution '' , not `` being piss-poor '' . 
  then none of them are refugees , because turkey is safe . 
   if a user is only submitting posts on one subject this is an issue . 
  would his immigration posts no longer be an issue if he started posting about carrots in / r/vegetables ? 
  that does n't make sense . 
  they can be , if they 've travelled directly from syria to greece . 
  if they 've gone via turkey then they 're no longer seeking asylum , as turkey is safe . 
  are n't iran and pakistan fairly safe ? 
  if a name has already been genericised then companies in a specific location should n't be able to demand exclusive use of it . 
  if up to 120 are against the bailout , would n't more oppose debt relief ? 
  it makes it look unlikely that significant debt relief could pass . 
  i wonder what would happen then . 
  i hate the word burglarised - burgled is much better . 
  did n't the goths later sack rome ? 
  [ 327 people ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11398825/terror-suspects-arrested-every-day-in-uk-as-police-call-for-extra-funding-to-cope-with-isil-threat.html ) were arrested for terror offences last year , and there were no successful attacks . 
  i 'm not too worried by these stories , the police and secret services appear to be extremely effective . 
  it sounds like the sort of story russia might push . 
  please do n't send them back , we 're not keen on them ourselves . 
  people do n't vote for or against the epp , they vote for national parties who happen to be members . 
  when they carried out an [ eu wide survey ] ( http://www.aecr.eu/media/aecramr-european-election-poll.pdf ) asking people simply to name eu parties , only 8.8 % of people could name a single one , whilst 44.1 % named a national party . 
  some people think a benefit of fptp is that is prevents those extreme neo-nazis from getting any influence . 
  that does n't appear to be happening here , you do n't need any form of id to vote . 
  [ source ] ( http://ourinsight.opinium.co.uk/sites/ourinsight.opinium.co.uk/files/op5154_opinium_pr_european_union_-_tables.pdf ) , with many more topics . 
  we do in england and wales , but not for some less serious crimes . 
  i do n't know about scotland though . 
  here , almost nobody knows or cares about the parties they vote for in eu elections nor what they do . 
  we voted conservative or labour , nobody had even heard of the epp , ecr , s&d and so on . 
  the discussion was all about how the uk government were doing and the future of the uk , not about anything the eu parliament has legislated on nor what it wants to do in the future . 
  the disconnect between the actions of the body you vote and how that body acts is a recipe for disaster . 
   ignorance of how much switzerland is de facto already subject to eu regulations and laws . 
  i guess we 'll put that to the test when the immigration restriction referendum kicks in in 2017 . 
  i think the argument is that whilst it might make him in the nastiest 5 % of the population now , back then he might only be in the nastiest 60 % .
