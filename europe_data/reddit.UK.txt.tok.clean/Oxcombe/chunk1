owing to the peak district , it looks as though england could have a ` golden doughnut ' in the near future . 
  european russia ( approx . 
  3,960,000 km ^ ^ 2 ) is home to 110,000,000 people . 
  this means that asian russia ( approx . 
  13,115,000 km ^ ^ 2 ) is home to 34,000,000 people . 
  to put this into perspective , the combined area of india * and * the usa is approx . 
  apologies , i was just a little concerned . 
  but you enjoyed it at the time ? 
  that 's a shame . 
  why ? 
  hollande states that should the uk leave the single market it should n't enjoy the benefits of membership , and that 's construed as vying for a trade-war ? 
  you could make a bloody fortune selling lengths of rope to those who frequent that place . 
  somebody is taking the piss . 
  either that , or their carer gave them internet privileges . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.east-inflatables.com/neweast/images/big/e15-023.jpg ) passes eu regulations !, 
  being half-gibraltan myself , i truly hope cooler heads prevail on both sides . 
  if either side deliberately escalates the situation there 'll be no winner . 
  you 've got to hand it to those romanians , they know how to stuff a turkey . 
  did i misinterpret the bbc 's interview with may ? 
  after watching it , i was left under the impression that she would be working to create a ` self-sufficient ' nhs by 2025 . 
  rather than poaching fully trained doctors from the developing world , we would increase the number of domestically trained doctors accordingly . 
  at no point was i led to believe that , as implied in this article , all overseas doctors employed by the nhs prior to that date would be find themselves out of work . 
  simply , there would be no demand for doctors trained overseas after 2025 . 
  the recent [ crackdown ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37557924 ) on illegal songbird poaching must have * ~ cough ~ * rustled a few feathers . 
  in 2012 oil shale fired power stations accounted for 85 % of estonia 's total electricity production .

  just to provide some balance , i thought it looked very nice . 
  i was recently given a leafblower , so i 'd be in seventh heaven in your country . 
  you 're right . 
  it was easier for me , as although my family are n't farmers , they do own agricultural land which tenants farm . 
  they would ask me for a hand if they were short of help , and i often gladly obliged . 
  i was paid , but it was almost always cash in hand . 
  what is this in reference to ? 
  my grandfather will keep scotland 's whiskey industry afloat , mark my words . 
  i would take time off college to drive tractors during the harvest . 
  i 'd sometimes work 20 hour shifts . 
  my friends were happy to put the hours in , too . 
  why has n't somebody told him he can go home yet ? 
  do n't mess with the magyar !, 
  much to my surprise , you 're correct . 
  my apologies . 
  in truth , i was unaware that the word could be spelt in multiple ways . 
  okay . 
  you were there ? 
  or ` carta ' for that matter . 
  ^ ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ guy . 
  ^ ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ dick . 
  sorry to hear about that , what problems are you having ? 
  there 's a jaguar xf and an xkr parked in my parent 's garage , and they 're both flawless . 
  i 'd go as far as saying the xf is the best car my dad has ever owned . 
  what makes a decent car ? 
  what makes a car appealing ? 
  the findings of recent buyer satisfaction surveys , recording the details of 50,000 uk car owners , would suggest that jaguar vehicles are marginally more reliable than those manufactured by the likes of audi , bmw and mercedes-benz . 
  land rover perform slightly worse than vw . 
  british vehicles of today are a far stretch better than those manufactured two or three decades ago . 
  my parents own both bmws and jaguars . 
  i personally prefer driving bmws , as i believe they 're more responsive and sporty . 
  however , in my opinion jaguar interiors are made of superior quality materials . 
  i would then argue your next point that we do manufacture desirable models . 
  the jaguar f-type is a beaut . 
  until quite recently , my brother worked for mclaren , who are renowned for their supercars . 
  i 'm not a fan of either aston martin or bentley , but these brands do have a large following . 
  thanks , i 'm visiting munich in just over a fortnight for a conference . 
  i 'm sure the subject of brexit will arise . 
  i guess the situation on the continent is similar to that which exists here . 
  i 've read plenty of embarrassing comments written by british ` redditors ' over the past month or so , but scarcely heard a single europhobic remark since the outcome of the referendum became clear . 
  we 'll make a killing in spare parts . 
  seriously , is the situation in the eu that bad these days ? 
  i 've not visited the continent since early-june . 
  i work as an engineer ( mining and tunnelling equipment ) , and a sizable proportion of our customers are european . 
  with the depreciation of the # , we 've had a lot of orders recently , so i 've spend a disproportionate amount of time going through specs . 
  with these people . 
  generally , most of them seem fairly unmoved by the vote . 
  i 've had a few dutch and swiss customers express their support of the outcome , whilst customers from france and romania have said some pretty unpleasant things to me . 
  has a wave of anti-british sentiment washed over europe , or is it mainly restricted to bitching over the internet etc ? 
  they were known as a poor man 's jaguar . 
  mind you , at that time jaguar were owned by ford ( as were land rover ) , who badly abused the brand . 
  thankfully , jaguar-land rover manufacture world-beating models these days , but back in the early 2000s they were pretty lame too . 
  i thought the bit about you liking rover and mg was the joke . 
  square steering wheels are the future , goddamnit !, 
  aston martin , bentley and rolls-royce models are prohibitively expensive to buy , let alone maintain . 
  two of these manufacturers will happily allow you to spec . 
  a vehicle so as its value exceeds # 1,000,000 . 
  i occasionally see aston martins and bentleys , but i 've never seen a new rolls-royce outside of london , because hardly anybody has the cash to buy one . 
  i do n't think it 's got much to do with the fuel consumption of these vehicles . 
  i ca n't see jean-claude being all too happy with this . 
  he 'd probably already called dibs on it . 
  wow , that is good . 
  my fees have just increased from # 65 to # 80 per visit , though i only visit the surgery once every 6 month . 
  my dentist is norwegian and has worked across scandinavia and western europe . 
  she mentioned to me that us brits have the healthiest teeth she 's come across , although our tea drinking habits cause excessive staining . 
   only had to pay # 10 for the appointment too . 
  :d i take it you use the nhs ? 
  i tried to see an nhs dentist in my region a couple of years ago , only to be told that they could n't accept new patients . 
  i 've since used a private surgery , though i begrudge the high fees . 
  mother : oh , little nikolai , you 've wet the bed again . 
  son : what ? 
  where is your proof ? 
  that 's for wheelchair access .
