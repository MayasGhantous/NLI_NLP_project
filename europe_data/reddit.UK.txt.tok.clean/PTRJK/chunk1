  the uk wo n't be * that * considerably weakened . 
  the uk would lose about $ 5 billion of its $ 60 billion defence budget . 
  it would more or less still be on par with france . 
  well , there 's a bit more to it . 
  the snp want to reduce scotland 's defence spending to 1.7 % of gdp and they want trident ( britain 's nuclear deterrent ) to be removed from their country , which would cost the uk a lot of money to do , which could mean the uk will not renew its nuclear deterrent , which could also mean that the uk will lose its seat at the un security council . 
  i 'm not sure what scotland 's foreign policy will be . 
  they would n't be much use if they became another ireland . 
  it will interesting to see how all this will effect their nato membership . 
  [ here 's the first of the class ( hms queen elizabeth ) beside the ship it 's replacing , hms illustrious . 
  well , i guess being from a country that has n't been invaded and occupied for almost a thousand years , i would n't know how it feels . 
   as an englishman living in poland , i hear this quite a lot ` its your fault , you left poland to rot ' or ` you did n't save us quickly enough . 
  i think it 's just how they cope with their national humiliation . 
  it 's a lot easier to scapegoat another country 's failings than hurt their pride by taking responsibility for their own military defeat and occupation . 
  is that accurate ? 
  because i just had a quick look on wikipedia and , for example it shows that germany has only [ 225 main battle tanks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_equipment_of_the_german_army#vehicles ) and the british army has [ 407 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_equipment_of_the_british_army#vehicles ) ? 
  not 2500 compared to 222 . 
  i 'm a bit sceptical about germany having almost double the number of combat aircraft too , as both britain and germany posses the same combat aircraft ( i.e. 
  tornado and euro-fighter ) in their air force , but britain has more [ euro-fighters ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurofighter_typhoon#operators ) and almost as many [ tornado 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panavia_tornado#operators ) ? 
  here 's some points from [ the telegraph  ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11008167/boris-to-raise-questions-over-britains-eu-membership.html ) * boris johnson ( london mayor ) will throw his weight behind a major report which says that it would be better for london if britain were to leave the european union than stay ** if david cameron fails to negotiate reforms . 
  ** * the capital 's gross domestic product ( gdp ) , currently # 350 bn . 
  * it would grow to # 640 bn by 2034 if britain stayed in a reformed eu and adopted policies encouraging more trade with the world 's fastest-growing markets * if the uk left the eu , while pursuing its own trade-friendly policies regardless , the london economy would still grow to # 615 bn over the next 20 years . 
  * staying in an unreformed eu would see london 's gdp expand to just # 495 bn by 2034 * but if britain leaves the eu , while failing to adopt a more outward-looking trading regime , the london economy would grow to just # 430 bn . 
  * `` the best economic scenario for britain over the next 20 years is to be in a significantly reformed european union , '' explained mr lyons . 
  * `` but if , as an alternative , the uk leaves the eu on good terms , while adopting sensible outward-looking trading policies , that comes a very close second . '', 
  did we ? 
  i do n't think any reasonable person believed it would last forever . 
  and when did germany ever have a larger navy ? 
  after the collapse of the soviet union until as recently as the first few years of the millennium ( when china overtook us ) , we had the world 's second largest navy . 
  although it 's size has recently been [ reduced by half ( compared to 1990 ) ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72330000/gif/_72330405_military_hardware_464.gif ) , it 's still the second largest navy in nato in terms of tonnage and it 's position will be secured when [ these two , each weighing at over 70,000 tons are completed ] ( http://www.clbh.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/hf_qe0001.jpg ) . 
  why is this being down voted ? 
  think of it as like : england = texas uk/britain = usa/america / ` murica great britain = north america, 
  if you say so :(, 
  i was n't sure , so i had to look it up . 
  from a comment from [ this bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/rogermosey/2009/09/why_team_gb.html ) :  the reason why the british team is known as ` team gb ' is because the irish olympic team represents the whole island of ireland . 
  it always has done since irish independence , just like in rugby union . 
  there was a prominent irish member of the ioc back in the middle part of the 20th century who saw to it that this remained the case . 
  athletes from northern ireland generally compete for the irish team ( it 's easier to get into ) , although they are given the choice , and so some do participate for the british team . 
   the british team tried to change its name to `` great britain and northern ireland '' and athletes were introduced under that banner in 1992 and 1996 , but the ioc eventually ruled against it and so we 're back to plain old great britain . 
  europe 's average is about 1.6 % of gdp .

  [ i posted something to r/europe ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/257k7l/has_europe_tried_to_merge_too_many_countries_and/ ) about what seems to be one of the major concerns many brits have with the eu . 
  [ also here 's a debate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7dvuptklh4 ) on ` should britain quit the european union ? ', 
  it might shed some more light on it . 
   when asked if he was being hypocritical by making money from immigration whilst apparently holding an anti-immigration position , the landlord said : `` not at all . 
  we do n't want to get into any business of questioning where people come from . 
  that would be totally unfair . 
   `` we operate in an area that is largely a migrant population . 
  from a commercial point of view and a human point of view , we are not concerned about what the ethnic origin of the tenants is . '' so he 's damned if he does n't discriminate against people 's ethnic origin and damned if he does ( i.e `` ukip racist bigot discriminates against immigrants '' ) ? 
  if he 's being anything , he 's selfless because he 's campaigning against what might not be in his own personal interest . 
  we have the same thing in the uk . 
  ` hope , not hate ' and ( ironically ) ` unite against fascism ' seem to be amongst the most fascist organisations in the uk . 
  [ one slightly amusing example .

  i personally support ( if all else fails ) a more integrated [ version of this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/257k7l/has_europe_tried_to_merge_too_many_countries_and/ ) or alternatively/eventually , [ something like this .

  [ i guess it changes annually ? 
  ] ( http://www.cityam.com/article/uk-becomes-top-german-trade-partner ), 
  i do n't understand his argument at all , or why population matters ? 
  the usa ca n't be compared to countries like germany , that has 1/4 of the usa 's population because `` apples and oranges '' ? 
  germany has 12 times the population of finland and yet germany somehow manages to have nationalised healthcare . 
  or is there some sort of arbitrary threshold when a country 's population gets too big for nationalised health care ? 
  the eu has a population of 500 million and it has free movement of people ( like states do in the us ) which also have access to each others healthcare , so in that context the eu is like a country , like the usa . 
  edit : new york city may have a bigger population than finland or norway , but so does london ( 8,308,369 ) . 
   if we want to do this it should be lithuania + poland + czech republic + slovakia + hungary . 
  [ what do you think of something like this ? 
  yeah , i was n't sure how else to group eastern europe , but you get the idea ? 
   i also was n't sure where to put hungary ; germanic , slavic or balkan ? 
  it will probably be controversial which ever i pick . 
  yeah , their military alliance would be about the size of the netherlands , except it would be less coordinated than the netherlands . 
  if you think the richer ( per capita ) countries should spend a smaller percentage of gdp on their military , do you also think the poorer ( per capita ) countries should spend a bigger percentage of gdp on their military ? 
  in other words ; the poorer the countries are , the more they should sacrifice for the alliance ?
