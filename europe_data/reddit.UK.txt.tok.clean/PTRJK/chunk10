  it 's very insightful ( given his background ) and an easy watch . 
   somewhat agreed , but one has to realise they do that because they feel it is necessary . 
  well , i do n't think anyone disagrees that israel does the things they do because * they * feel it is necessary . 
  many people throughout history have done terrible things because they thought it were necessary and many other people thought it were necessary to stop them . 
  to israel , the terrible treatment and forced exodus of palestinians is necessary for the re-establishment of a jewish homeland ( and perhaps to bring about the coming of their messiah ) . 
  to me , it 's a state that controls a population as big as its own with military might and tells themselves their imaginary friend gave them their land , and completely ignores the people who were already there . 
   from how you wrote it you seem to have a fixed opinion on the issue , well , i would n't say it 's `` fixed '' , but probably everyone who cares enough to speak about the issue has a strong opinion on it , one way or the other . 
  what 's your opinion on [ miko peled 's speech about the issue of israel and palestine ] ( https://youtu.be/etxam-oylqq?t=90 ) ( he 's israeli born and his father was a general in the israeli army ) ? 
  it 's quite long but very interesting and he challenges the arguments you 've made in defense of israel . 
  just to be clear , i support israels right to * exist * and i do n't support the targeting of civilians by hamas , but i do n't think those justify some of things israel has done and is doing to the palestinian people : ensuring palestinians do not have a state , do not have rights , do not have water and dare not resist . 
  we 'd be losing our shits if russia was actively annexing and ethnically cleansing its neighbours land , but it seems when israel does it ( and has been doing it for the last half century or so ) , not only does the entire western hemisphere turn a blind eye , the americans are actually funding/financially assisting it . 
  why is that ? 
  why is israel getting away with what no other country would ? 
  how is it that we 're sanctioning russia for annexing crimea , while we 're supporting israel doing far worse for far longer ? 
  it 's very short-sighted to judge britain and its value to the eu , by the actions and characteristics of one government ( the tories , led by david cameron ) . 
  let 's not forget that probably the two most significant things to happen in europe in the last 20 years or so was : * the creation of the single market - which was britain 's idea ; first invented by a british commissioner called arthur cockfield and was enshrined in a single european act by margret thatcher . 
  * the embracement of central and eastern europe into the european union after the collapse of the berlin wall - which was a british achievement ( most notably by the very pro-eu tony blair ) , against the objections of other countries . 
  the fact that britain generally gets such little recognition or respect for what it has contributed to the eu/europe , may be another reason why so many britons feel they want to leave . 
  it would be much easier for everyone if you bothered to take responsibility for your own enlightenment , but since you asked so politely ( / s ) . 
  ** [ point 1 . 
  ] ** [ a * little * research ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35654692 ) - the bellingcat report was not `` written by some unemployed random brit '' :  bellingcat says it `` brings together contributors who specialise in open source and social media investigation '' to cover a `` variety of subjects '' . 
   it was founded by british journalist eliot higgins . 
  ** [ point 2 . 
  ] ** if you wanted to know about higgins ( and bellingcat 's ) credentials/references , you only had to bother reading beyond the first paragraph of [ ` life and work ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eliot_higgins#life_and_work ) :  higgins ' analyses of syrian weapons , which began as a hobby out of his home in his spare time , ** are now frequently cited by the press and human rights groups and have led to questions in parliament . 
  ** [ 1 ] his blog , brown moses blog , began in march 2012 by covering the syrian conflict . 
  higgins operates by monitoring over 450 youtube channels daily looking for images of weapons and tracking when new types appear in the war , where , and with whom . 
  [ 1 ] ** according to guardian reporter matthew weaver , higgins has been `` hailed as something of a pioneer '' for his work . 
  [ 1 ] **  ** higgins is credited with being among the first to report on the widespread use of improvised barrel bombs by the syrian government , ** a phenomenon which has spread to other troubled nations such as iraq to combat insurgencies and opposition forces . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  ** in 2015 , higgins partnered with the atlantic council to co-author the report hiding in plain sight : putin 's war in ukraine which examined direct russian military involvement in ukraine . 
  the report was the inspiration for the documentary selfie soldiers in which vice news correspondent simon ostrovsky followed digital traces left by a russian soldier named bato dambaev who was sent to fight in eastern ukraine . 
  in june 2015 on the invitation of former belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt , higgins together with his report co-author atlantic council 's maks czuperski presented hiding in plain sight at the european parliament alongside russian opposition figure ilya yashin and former russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov . 
  [ 11 ] **  ** higgins has received significant praise and support from human rights groups , journalists , and non-profit organisations . 
  `` brown moses is among the best out there when it comes to weapons monitoring in syria , '' said peter bouckaert , emergencies director at human rights watch . 
  [ 1 ] the new york times war reporter c.j. 
  chivers said that fellow journalists should be more honest about the debt they owe to higgins ' brown moses blog . 
  `` many people , whether they admit or not , have been relying on that blog 's daily labour to cull the uncountable videos that circulate from the conflict , '' he said . 
  [ 1 ] amnesty international said that the brown moses blog was vital in proving the syrian government was using ballistic missiles , information then used to send a research mission to syria . 
  [ 13 ] **  ** eliot higgins has been a subject of interest for the british and u.s. media . 
  he has been profiled in print by the the guardian , [ 1 ] the independent , [ 7 ] the huffington post , [ 3 ] and the new yorker . 
  [ 2 ] television features have been run by channel 4 news [ 13 ] and cnn international . 
  [ 4 ] he has also been covered by non-english sources . 
  **  among its major projects , bellingcat has investigated the downing of malaysia airlines flight 17 in ukraine . 
  ** its work is being considered by the dutch police investigating the crash , [ 7 ] and higgins has been interviewed twice by the investigators ** . 
  bellingcat has suggested that the anti-aircraft missile that hit the plane was fired by a russian unit , the 53rd buk brigade , based in the city of kursk . 
  [ 18 ] on 31 may 2015 , bellingcat released a report alleging among other things photo manipulation of satellite images released by the russian ministry of defense . 
  [ 19 ] the photos concerned the location of ukrainian buk missile launchers around the time mh17 was shot down . 
  [ 20 ] ** [ point 3 . 
  ] ** use your common sense : if bellingcat ( and their report ) really are what you say they are and lack such credibility , then why is their work being considered by the dutch police investigating the crash and why would the [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35654692 ) and [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/mh17-report-identifies-russian-soldiers-suspected-of-downing-plane-in-ukraine?cmp=oth_b-aplnews_d-1 ) report their findings and why are n't they given similar attention/profile to the `` millions of other blogs '' you talk about , which are apparently `` no different '' ? 
  if you want to talk about credibility , what credibility do you have to be dismissing bellingcats report as `` bullshit '' [ ( have you even looked at it ) ] ( https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/53rd-report-public.pdf ) ? 
  bellingcat , the dutch-led investigator team , the bbc and the guardian all have more credibility than the outspoken opinions of some random redditor , who clearly does n't even know who bellingcat are and has n't even bothered to read the report . 
  you may think you 're being rational/level-head , but really you 're just being putin 's useful idiot , who 's doing the work of his paid trolls and state-run media for free ( or not , as the case may be ) and it 's the combined efforts of people like you which help cover putin 's ass and make it more difficult for the families of the victims of mh17 to get justice . 
  makes sense . 
  rather than countering the information in each report , it 's much easier if you just counter the source so people no longer trust them , which consequentially makes anything further they report less credible and influential . 
  france and the uk are also more important with their global-reach power projection ( blue-water navies and expeditionary capabilities ) . 
  unarmed police is the way we like it and we are n't going to let terrorists ( or americans ) change it . 
  having unarmed police has probably saved countless more lives ( including innocents ) than it has saved . 
  in this terrorist incident , having armed police would not have prevented the man from getting his throat slit because the crime had already been committed before the police ( armed or not ) could respond to it . 
  but , just imagine if this terrorist had access to a firearm and used that instead . 
  even if there were armed citizens nearby , let alone armed police not nearby at the moment of the crime , i sincerely believe he could 've and would 've taken many more lives before he 'd been stopped . 
  we 're doubling our strike force against daesh by sending 2 additional tornados and 6 typhoons to raf akrotiri ( cypres ) , today . 
  i 'm curious whether the usa * still has n't * surpassed the british empire , actually ( if it still existed ) . 
  do you have a source ? 
  i 've read that if the british empire reunited , it would have a gdp of about $ 25 trillion . 
  i 'll try to find a source for that . 
  i know the ` common wealth ' - which excludes a significant number of countries that were in the empire - has a gdp almost equal to the united states ( $ 15 trillion ) . 
  the usa might have overtaken it , then fallen back over the century , as various countries have risen and fallen during the period , especially since the empire 's dissolution . 
  i do n't know . 
   we surpassed the british economically somewhere around 1880-1900 . 
  they were still the most influential country for the next half-a-century . 
  you surpassed the british nation , but not its empire ( a giant appendage of britain ) . 
  maybe , but i think under the right climate/circumstance and we made enough compromises , it could happen . 
  perhaps if we ( gb ) also became a republic ( at least after queen elizabeth dies ) and the bia were governed from somewhere away from england ( so westminster became solely the parliament of england ) , to somewhere less provocative , like maybe wales ( cardiff ) ; a small country , located geographically in the centre of the alliance , i think that would be fair a compromise ( along with obviously seeding n. ireland back to them ) . 
  remaining in the eu could inevitably push scotland to leave the uk too . 
  with ` ever closer union/federation ' , westminster is becoming an ever more unnecessary ( and perhaps `` inconvenient '' ) middle-man between holyrood and brussels . 
  i do n't think the uk unionists , who are also eu integrationists , can have their cake and eat it for much longer . 
  ultimately , i think you 'll have to choose one union or the other , the status quo is not sustainable . 
  the eu 's single market ( of 500 million ) is replacing the economic advantages of being part of the uk ( a market of 60 million ) and it will no-doubt replace the `` security '' advantages of being in the uk , too ( if nato has n't already ) . 
  ideally , i think what would keep us together if we did leave , is if the uk immediately reformed and devolved as much power as possible - including to england ( with its own parliament ) , but * especially to scotland * - to become a ` british alliance ' , where we 'd share/coordinate what 's mutually beneficial where necessary ( ie . 
  defence , currency , free movement etc ) , but otherwise minding our own business , controlling our own affairs where we can . 
  perhaps , if it is n't too farfetched and we made enough compromises , we could also solve the `` irish problem '' by inviting the r. ireland to join , with the incentive of seeding n. ireland back to them ( forming a british & amp ; irish alliance , ` b.i.a ' ) . 
  northern ireland would still be in a union/alliance with great britain and the uk would no longer exist as such , which would suck a lot of wind out of both their sails , so ireland could be reunited . 
  i know r. ireland is largely pro eu now , but who knows what it will be in 5/10/20 years time ( if the eurozone still has n't sorted itself out and if we 're doing well outside the eu ) ... 
  in a few decades , we 'd collectively have a population larger , or at least as big as germany 's , but be a geographical island fortress ( es ) , we could effectively be the ` japan of the west ' ( keeping its big neighbour in check ) . 
  it showed `` nerve '' , but was it worth the repercussions ? 
  what did she actually achieve ? 
  the issue is not so much that there would be repercussions , it 's that there would be repercussions * without achieving anything * , which shows senseless naivety . 
   but for some , principles are less important than money . 
  if only it were as simple/black and white as that . 
  [ how far did sweden get with your principled idealism , before giving way to the pragmatism of ` realpolitik ' ? 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/03/20/sweden-stood-up-for-human-rights-in-saudi-arabia-this-is-how-saudi-arabia-is-punishing-sweden/ ) geo politics , national interests and having realistic expectations of what your country can achieve , trumps making self-righteous ( but ultimately futile ) displays of moral indignation , while getting diplomatically and economically punished . 
  i guess that 's the difference between britain and sweden . 
  we 're ruthless pragmatists and they 're naive narcissists . 
  i 'd rather we were an irrelevant country , which could trade with who we want , control our own currency , make our own laws/policies etc , than be an irrelevant province of a german dominated europe . 
  germany is to europe what london is to the uk : a place which is sucking in and concentrating all the wealth and power . 
  tbh , if we ended up being a slightly more relevant australia , or canada ( perhaps the ` japan of the west ' ) , i would n't lose much sleep over it .
