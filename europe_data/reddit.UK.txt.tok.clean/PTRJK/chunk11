  not really . 
  i 'm not sure you read the article . 
  did you read the bit about the ` power dynamics ' ? 
   the power dynamics of european leadership would change if britain quit . 
  germany would lose a counterweight to french economic dirigisme . 
  france would lose its main partner in supporting eu military missions in africa and elsewhere . 
   europe might be less inclined to stand up to russia , or to work as closely with the united states . 
   the eu would remain divided into a majority of countries which share the euro , and a minority that have not yet joined or have voted to stay out . 
  but those non-euro countries - sweden , denmark , poland , the czech republic , hungary , bulgaria , romania and croatia - would have less clout without britain 's presence as the main financial center outside the single currency area . 
   guntram wolff , a german economist who heads the bruegel economic think-tank in brussels , said the berlin establishment was in a funk , fearing that `` we are left alone with all those mediterranean spending countries with a preference for redistribution and we are going to pay for them and drift away from a liberal , pro-market , ttip europe . 
  that 's the big angst . '', 
   britain 's eu friends would lose a powerful ally on issues such as upholding free and unfettered competition , curbing state aid to industry , resisting tax harmonization , and opposing barriers to trade with china and other emerging economies . 
  a hub of eu-funded research and innovation would drift away . 
   `` i fear it would be a less open , liberal europe without the brits , '' said a swedish diplomat . 
  `` that would make it harder for us to win the economic arguments . '', 
  also this further up :  it would also blow a hole in the eu 's common budget and tilt the balance away from the open , competitive economy favored by the netherlands , sweden , ireland and central european states , toward protectionism and heavier regulation . 
   even committed european federalists acknowledge that britain has made major contributions in opening up the community 's internal market , promoting an outward-looking foreign policy and sharing a pragmatic , empirical administrative culture . 
   `` we would lose the intrinsic value of great britain - its global geopolitical vision , economic common sense and financial and legal know-how , '' said sylvie goulard , a french member of the european parliament from the centrist liberal alde group . 
  well , it 's a win your vision of the eu anyway .

   russia , which received 112 votes , lost its regional seat to hungary , with 144 votes , and croatia with 112 votes . 
   human rights groups had called for countries to reject the candidacies of russia and saudi arabia , which has been accused of indiscriminate attacks against civilians in yemen . 
  ** saudi arabia 's election , however , was a foregone conclusion since it was running unopposed for its regional seat .

  do you know how many seats the neo-nazi party ` svoboda ' has in the ukrainian parliament ? 
  ' 6 ' ; losing 30 seats of the 37 seats it had won in the 2012 parliamentary election . 
  that 's a great fascist coup ... was russia as concerned about the rise of ultra-nationalism in ukraine then , as they are now ? 
  russia does n't seem to have a problem with fascist parties when they 're on their side ( funding fascist parties across europe , as well as the duma hosting them ) .

   but russia cares little about the future of syria . 
   lol the only thing russia cares about is sending a message to the west that `` sovereignty '' ( even of a dictatorship ) should mean an unlimited license for the government to do as they please within their national borders ; including deliberately [ bombing hospitals ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/03/syrian-and-russian-forces-targeting-hospitals-as-a-strategy-of-war/ ) and indiscriminately dropping [ chlorine gas ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/25/un-proves-assad-regime-dropped-chemical-bombs-on-civilians/ ) and [ barrel bombs ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/05/syrias-circle-of-hell-barrel-bombs-in-aleppo/ ) on civilians .

   russian attacks also appear to have * deliberately * targeted civilians and the infrastructure of civilian life -- markets , hospitals and homes -- while the coalition has been trying to * avoid or limit * civilian casualties , although it could do far more , human rights groups said .

  [ or as this comment on the financial times puts it ( screencap ) . 
   and it does include the `` freedom to tell barefaced lies '' unfortunately for rt , the uk has a broadcasting code for ` news programming ' ( enforced by an independent regulator ) :  it is important to note the broadcasting of highly critical comments concerning the policies and actions of any individual or organisation , including the government or state agency , is not , in itself , a breach of the special impartiality rules . 
  further , the special impartiality rules do not prevent a broadcaster from making programmes about politically controversial subject matters , and it is crucial the broadcasters have the editorial freedom to do so . 
  however , in doing so , the broadcaster must ensure , in accordance with rule 5.5 , that programmes dealing with politically controversial matters preserve a level of impartiality which is appropriate to the subject and nature of the programme , taking into account other relevant contextual factors . 
  so , no . 
  they do n't have the right [ to tell * bear * faced lies  ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/21/rt-sanctioned-over-series-of-misleading-articles-by-media-watchdog )  in a ruling publishing on monday , ofcom said the channel -- previously called russia today -- had breached the broadcasting code four times across three programmes . 
   the programmes include two episodes of the channel 's truthseeker series , including one which alleged that the bbc had staged a chemical weapons attack by the assad regime in syria . 
   the ruling said the programme about reports on the bbc 's news at ten and panorama had misled viewers by suggesting a complaint made by a viewer represented a `` massive public investigation '' into the bbc 's reporting of the attack . 
   it also separately found that the programme had breached rules by failing to ensure the allegations were presented fairly and not giving the bbc the chance to respond to the allegations . 
   the rt programme , broadcast in march 2014 , included allegations that the bbc had edited an interview with a syrian doctor to misrepresent her comments about treating victims of an attack . 
   ofcom did not consider the accuracy of the claims made in the truthseeker programmes as the show is considered current affairs rather than news programming . 
   another episode of truthseeker claimed there was a government-backed genocide taking place in eastern ukraine , while a half-hour standalone segment called ukraine 's refugees alleged the ukrainian government was involved in killing civilians . 
   ukraine 's refugees featured only first-hand accounts , but the ukrainian government 's response was limited to a six-second message shown at the end of the programme . 
   both shows were deemed to have breached rules on impartiality . 
  truthseeker was cancelled in july 2014 . 
   the rulings require rt to broadcast corrections detailing the findings . 
  so , all that hysteria on this sub yesterday about the `` british government '' `` freezing '' `` rt 's bank accounts '' and `` curbing freedom of speech '' was baseless ... ( well , based on russian propaganda ) . 
  the other story of this investigation is that it also confirms russian troops and equipment have been in eastern ukraine . 
  taking a buk-launcher across the russian border and into ukraine does n't quite fit putin 's `` russian volunteers '' narrative . 
  you 'd think the russian authorities might notice someone `` voluntarily '' taking [ one of these ] ( http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2014/07/buk.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;w=620&amp;h=545 ) out of its base , across the border and into another country ... it 's not exactly something you can just smuggle in your car boot/trunk . 
  if it was n't for him taking the moral high ground over your fascist , nazi collaborating regime in ww2 , where would your moral high ground be today , relative to churchill 's then ? 
  you 're a child of churchill 's legacy in europe . 
  his legacy was n't just the defiance and defeat of the nazi 's in western europe ( as well as putting a halt to soviet expansion ) , it 's [ a europe of democracy , the rule of law and human rights . 
  ] ( http://rightsinfo.org/wrote-european-convention-human-rights/ ) it was winston churchill who in 1948 advocated a european ` charter of human rights ' ( later named the european convention on human rights ) in direct response to the abject horrors of the nazi regime and the second world war . 
  on the other hand , he said some racist things , so yeah , on balance , `` fuck him . '', 
  / s he , at the very least , deserves your respect as a man of his time , who we 'd be far worse off without and who took a stand against men who 'd be considered far less saintly by today 's standards ( including one your country `` kindly gifted '' us ) . 
   i do n't think you understand the attitude here in the uk ( yes i 'm there too ) at the minute , given that not only leave , but many remain voters do n't want to wait for years on end , i think the general attitude here is frustration/anxiety at the lack of clarity from theresa may on brexit ( `` what will brexit mean '' , `` when does the process of leaving begin '' , `` will there really be a brexit '' etc ) , rather than `` why have n't we exited the eu already . '' once we start seeing clarity and things moving forward with negotiations underway , i think people will feel be much more relaxed about it . 
   besides , what sort of a deal do you think the uk will get ? 
  i do n't really know , i 'm not even sure theresa may knows what kind of deal she 's going to aim for at the minute . 
   how patient ? 
  perhaps more patient than the eu ? 
  i guess it depends how much of a nuisance britain makes itself to the eu . 
  barely over half the british population voted leave and a wager significantly less than half would be * impatient * with leaving the eu , if they knew waiting would get britain a better deal or certain set of demands . 
  i think the continent has a tendency to [ underestimate the british ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/09/uk-completely-lost-post-brexit-and-will-plead-for-a-deal-top-bru/ ) , especially when the british feel adversity from the continent . 
  ` in three weeks england will have her neck wrung like a chicken . ', 
  if there 's one thing the british will do out of spite , it 's waiting while the eu keeps `` sweet-talking '' us and telling us to leave . 
   do you think that the uk public would stand for the government not triggering article 50 for so long ? 
  i think maybe if they understood that it was for getting the best deal for britain , i think most would be willing to be patient ... how long do you think the eu would stand for the british government prolonging negotiations and vetoing practically left , right and center ( i doubt it would quite come to that , bet you get the point ) ? 
  what makes you think it 's purely out of spite ? 
  let 's just say it would be stupid not to use the veto as a bargaining chip for negotiations . 
  the eu will want something from britain ( i.e. 
  not to gridlock 27 states for years , if not indefinitely ) , and britain will want something ( 's ) from the eu . 
   the uk can not gridlock 27 states for years while they figure out how to leave .
