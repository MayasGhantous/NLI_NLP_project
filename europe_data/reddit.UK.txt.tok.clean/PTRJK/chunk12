   in sweden , prime minister stefan loefven has warned the u.k. against pursuing an `` aggressive '' agenda that includes corporate tax cuts . 
  in an interview with bloomberg last month , loefven said that such policies would only sour relations between britain and the eu . 
  eu countries seem to be pursuing an `` aggressive agenda '' of courting british businesses ... `` do n't you dare react and sour relations between us . '', 
  it 's a non-story , really . 
  it 's less than half the number of people in my village ... 
  if you want to ridicule an entire nation ( of 65 million people ) based on the searches of 1,000 people , i 'm sure we could also dig up a lot of dirt on your country . 
  that `` spike '' was fewer than 1,000 people .

  i think the eu will soldier on . 
  rip uk . 
  300 years was n't a bad run . 
  shame it had to end over a petty protest vote . 
  nationalism is on the march across the western world , feeding upon the terrors it seeks to inflame . 
  every nationalist will tell you that their nationalism is different , a natural , benign response to their country 's own particular needs and challenges , nothing to do with that nationalism of yore that ended up killing people , yet every academic study of nationalism has revealed the same key features . 
  your country is the greatest in the world , the nationalist cries , and anyone who is n't chanting that is a traitor !, 
  drape yourself in the flag : does n't that make you feel bigger and more powerful ? 
  finding the present scary ? 
  we 've got a golden past to sell you , a mythical age that will dawn again once we 've got rid of the mexicans/left the eu/annexed ukraine !, 
  now place your trust in our simplistic slogans and enjoy your rage aginst the other !, 
  look towards the republican party in america and shudder . 
  ` make america great again ! ', 
  cries a man who is fascist in all but name . 
  his stubby fingers are currently within horrifyingly close reach of america 's nuclear codes . 
  he achieved this pre-eminence by proposing crude , unworkable solutions to complex threats . 
  terrorism ? 
  ` ban all muslims ! ', 
  immigration ? 
  ` build a wall ! ', 
  he has the temperament of an unstable nightclub bouncer , jeers at violence when it breaks out at his rallies and wears his disdain for women and minorities with pride . 
  god help america . 
  god help us all . 
  donald trump supports the break up of the eu . 
  the inheritor of a family fortune , he has never needed to cooperate or collaborate and he appears incapable of understanding complexity or nuance . 
  of foreign leaders or would-be leaders , trump is joined only by vladimir putin and marine le pen in urging brexit upon the uk . 
  other than those three , there is no major political leader who is n't begging britain to stay put , for the political and economic stability of europe and the wider world . 
  i 'm the mongrel product of this european continent and i 'm an internationalist . 
  i was raised by a francophile mother whose family was proud of their part-french heritage . 
  my french ancestors lived in the troubled province of alsace , which spent hundreds of years being alternately annexed by germany and france . 
  i 've lived in france and portugal and i 've studied french and german . 
  i love having these mulitple allegiances and cultural associations . 
  they make me stronger , not weaker . 
  i glory in association with the cultures of my fellow europeans . 
  my values are not contained or proscribed by borders . 
  the absence of a visa when i cross the channel has symbolic value to me . 
  i might not be in my house , but i 'm still in my hometown . 
  the ` leave ' campaign is selling itself as the courageous option . 
  take a leap of faith , they say . 
  step off the cliff and let the flag catch you !, 
  with the arrogance of a bunch of mini-trumps they swear that everything will be glorious as long as we disregard the experts and listen to them . 
  embrace the rage and trust your guts , which nigel farage undoubtedly hopes contain a suspicion of brown people , an unthinking jingoism and an indifference to the warnings of history . 
  for many of our countrymen , i suspect a ` leave ' vote will be a simple howl of frustration , a giant two fingers to the spectres that haunt our imaginations , against terrorism that seems almost supernatural in its ability to hit us in our most vulnerable places , against huge corporations who refuse to meet their basic moral obligations , against bureaucracy we are afraid will strangle us , against shadowy elites we are told are working to do us down . 
  how easy to project all of this onto the eu , how satisfying to turn this referendum into a protest against everything about modern life that scares us , whether rationally or not . 
  yet how can a retreat into selfish and insecure individualism be the right response when europe faces genuine threats , when the bonds that tie us are so powerful , when we have come so far together ? 
  how can we hope to conquer the enormous challenges of terrorism and climate change without cooperation and collaboration ? 
  no , i do n't think the eu 's perfect . 
  which human union could n't use improvement ? 
  from friendships , marriages , families and workplaces , all the way up to political parties , governments and cultural economic unions , there will be flaws and disagreements . 
  because we 're human . 
  because we 're imperfect . 
  so why bother building these ambitious alliances and communities ? 
  because they protect and empower us , because they enable bigger and better achievements than we can manage alone . 
  we should be proud of our enduring desire to join together , seeking better , safer , fairer lives , for ourselves and for millions of others . 
  the research demonstrates that we do n't know what we 've got .
