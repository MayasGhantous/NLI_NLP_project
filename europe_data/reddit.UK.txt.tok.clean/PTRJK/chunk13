  ignorant of what it gives us , we take the benefits of eu membership for granted . 
  in a few days ' time , we 'll have to decide which monsters we believe are real and which illusory . 
  everything is going to come down to whose story we like best , but at the moment we vote , we stop being readers and become authors . 
  the ending of this story , whether happy or not , will be written by us . 
  her blog post ( so you can judge what she wrote , for yourself ) : ** on monsters , villains and the eu referendum ** i 'm not an expert on much , but i do know how to create a monster . 
  all enduring fictional bad guys encapsulate primal terrors and share certain traits . 
  invincible to the point of immortality , they commit atrocities without conscience and can not be defeated by the ordinary man or by conventional means . 
  hannibal lecter , big brother , and lord voldemort : all are simultaneously inhuman and superhuman and that is what frightens us most . 
  as this country has entered what will come to be seen as one of the most divisive and bitter political campaigns ever waged within its borders , i 've thought a lot about the rules for creating villains . 
  we are being asked whether we wish to remain part of the european union and both sides of this campaign have been telling us stories . 
  i do n't mean that in the sense of lying ( although lies have certainly been told ) . 
  i mean that they are appealing to us through our universal need to make sense of the world by storytelling and that they have not been afraid to conjure monsters calculated to stir up our deepest fears . 
  this is nothing new , of course . 
  all political campaigns tell stories . 
  they cast themselves as our champions , flatter us with tales of who we are or could be , sell us rose-tinted memories of the past and draw frightening pictures of the perils that lie ahead if we pick the wrong heroes . 
  nevertheless , the tales we have been told during this referendum have been uglier than any i can remember in my lifetime . 
  if anyone has enjoyed this referendum , it can only be those hoping for greater personal power at the end of it . 
  the leave campaign 's narrative has descended to this : we are being exploited or cheated by the eu . 
  if we ca n't see that britain will only regain superpower status if we leave the union , we must be unpatriotic , cowardly or part of a corrupt elite . 
  remainers have mostly countered , not with an optimistic vision of the union , but with bleak facts : money is pouring out of the country at the prospect of the brexit and experts in every field think that leaving the eu will be a catastrophic mistake . 
  be afraid , says remain , turn back while there 's still time : you are hurtling towards a precipice . 
  however , remain are finding many ears closed to their grim prognostications . 
  the economic crash of 2008 left a pervasive feeling in its wake that financial institutions are not to be trusted . 
  ` the establishment ' has become a term of blanket abuse . 
  we live in a cynical and insecure age . 
  trust in disinterested sources has been shaken , while popular culture glorifies the hunch and the gut feeling . 
  in america , they call this ` post-truth politics ' . 
  forget the facts , feel the fury . 
  the ` leave ' campaign is benefiting from our widespread cynicism and , unsurprisingly , fanning it . 
  ` people in this country have had enough of experts , ' michael gove declared recently on television . 
  so what if the financial times , the markets and the heads of the bank of england and the international monetary fund agree that brexit will do severe damage to the economy ? 
  they 're just scaremongering , says gove . 
  leaders of both campaigns want us frightened only by monsters of their choosing . 
  for some on the leave side , the eu is not merely imperfect , or in need of improvement : it is villainous . 
  the union that was born out of a collective desire never to see another war in europe is depicted as an orwellian monolith , big brotheresque in its desire for control . 
  widespread confusion about what the eu does and does not do has been helpful to leave . 
  the results of a recent ipsos/mori poll reveal the depth of our ignorance . 
  we dramatically underestimate the amount of international investment we receive from the eu , while grossly overestimating how many laws it makes , how much it spends on administration and the number of eu immigrants in this country . 
  in some cases our guesses were out by factors of ten . 
  immigrants , of course , have been at the centre of some of the nastiest arguments of this campaign . 
  reasoned discussion has proven nigh on impossible . 
  remainers insist that we retain border control and that we need immigration , not least because so many of our medical staff running the nhs come from abroad . 
  they insist that our defensive capability and our anti-terrorist strategies are enhanced by membership of the eu . 
  their arguments have proven only partially successful , because leave has been busy threatening us with another montster : a tsunami of faceless foreigners heading for our shores , among them rapists and terrorists . 
  it is dishonourable to suggest , as many have , that leavers are all racists and bigots : they are n't and it is shameful to suggest that they are . 
  nevertheless , it is equally nonsensical to pretend that racists and bigots are n't flocking to the ` leave ' cause , or that they are n't , in some instances , directing it . 
  for some of us , that fact alone is enough to give us pause . 
  the picture of nigel farage standing in front of a poster showing a winding line of syrian refugees captioned ` breaking point ' is , as countless people have already pointed out , an almost exact duplicate of propaganda used by the nazis . 
  we punch above our weight in global influence * because * we sit at the top-table of multinational organisations , like the eu ... not in spite of it . 
  i do n't see how our country being broken apart , locked-out of eu decision making , having trade barriers put up between ourselves and the world 's largest single market and our single biggest export market , possibly inflicting another recession on ourselves and becoming an insular ` little england ' , would be `` greater '' than remaining a strong , influential and outward-looking united kingdom . 
  so long as europe 's sufficiently divided and weakened ( which could happen after a brexit ) , russia could exert its influence over europe as ` top dog ' of the pack ( divide and rule ) ; hence ` the end of the west . ', 
  get ready to live in a world where our european neighbours and allies turn distinctly pro-russian/eurasian , fellow ~ ~ brits ~ ~ english , while we 'll be to europe what russia is to europe now : locked-out , isolated and weakened . 
  btw , the americans wo n't give a shit about our locked-out , isolated and weakened little england . 
  they value an influential and outward-looking united kingdom . 
  he knows what he 's doing . 
  he 's trying to turn britain europe against each other in the run-up to the eu referendum . 
  we indirectly are , when russians are influencing the narrative in europe . 
  i 've also seen it posted a few times in the comments sections of articles about ` russia ' and ` euro 2016 ' . 
  for example , [ this one about ` russian media base euro 2016 violence claims on fake twitter accounts '  ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/16/russia-fake-euro-2016-violence-fans-twitter )  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qepdvo_o-6a  this article is nonsense . 
  here 's the proof [ above ] . 
  drunken english fans chanting '' we hate russia '' with the english running riot in lillle at this moment this article is a diversion to avoid facing up to the appalling behaviour of english fans who caused mayhem in both marseille and now lille by attacking french police and causing misery , fear and disruption for the locals of both cities . 
  have the moral honesty to look in the mirror my fellow britons . 
  what would your reactions be if another countries football ' fans ' descended on a british city rampaging through it , drunk , obnoxious and threatening , whilst goading and attacking the british police ? 
  listen to their accents at the end . 
  according to russians on social media , this is `` proofs '' the english are provoking the russians , despite the two not sounding english at all . 
  in fact , they sound like they have russian or ukrainian accents ... 
  [ my suspicion  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4nw6kq/euro_2016_moscow_football_official_to_violent/d47kdqt )  i ca n't help but wonder whether russia 's deliberately trying to stir-up violence with england supporters to foster division between england and the rest of europe , during this key period in the referendum campaign . 
   [ look at the comments on this submission , for example ( and the editorialized headline ) . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4nm97o/england_fans_riot_at_old_port_in_marseille/?compact=true ) this is certainly fueling resentment of each other ; anglophobia on one side and the english feeling like they 're being deliberately targeted , unfairly blamed and hated by the rest of europe .

   northern ireland and poland ** fans ** ` attacked by local ** hooligans ** ' in nice [ `` sounds fair . 
  '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4nn8q6/england_11_russia_euro_2016/d45as8e ) oh wait , this is not about england ... 
  [ ` insulting ' was removed from section 5 of public order act in 2013  ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21020737 )  `` a person is guilty of an offence if he uses threatening , abusive or insulting words or behaviour '', 
  nobody is making that argument , except for yourself . 
  it 's a strawman . 
  because britain maybe gaining some leverage on some trade negotiations are worth the potential economic and geopolitical fallout of the european union collapsing ... ? 
  ' ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5326/13968917952_171b7cf07f_b.jpg ) it 's in no more britain 's interest to see the eu collapse for some favourable trade deals as it is in canada 's . 
  there 's no reason or evidence to think that . 
  theresa may has made it clear she 's pro-eu ( before and after the referendum ) . 
  maybe what she 's trying to do is , by closening relations with trump , persuade trump to be also more sympathetic to britain 's interests ( supporting a united liberal democratic europe ) , while less sympathetic to russia 's ... you 've got this bizaare notion that britain and russia are working together to undermine the eu , when [ if anything it seems we 're competing against each other ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/donald-trump-dossier-president-elect-says-intelligence-director/ ) to influence the new american administration for opposing objectives . 
  would you rather britain turned its back on america , and a ` special relationship ' developed between america and russia ? 
  what would that mean for the eu ? 
  edit : itt : completely baseless , irrational anglophobia . 
  yet , the british government is naive enough to invest billions , upon billions of pounds ( on submarines and warheads ) to insure britain has an independent nuclear deterrent , and then undermine the whole doctrine by letting a vital component of the deterrent be comprised to save a bit of money ? 
  it defies common sense . 
  i think you 're naive . 
  i think even the most staunch brexiters said they wanted the uk to continue to cooperate with europe and remain close friends and allies ( certainly on issues such as security and defense ) . 
  also , from theresa mays recent brexit speech :  `` our vote to leave the european union was no rejection of the values we share . 
  the decision to leave the eu represents no desire to become more distant to you , our friends and neighbours . 
  we will continue to be reliable partners , willing allies and close friends , '' she will say . 
   `` we want to buy your goods , sell you ours , trade with you as freely as possible and ** work with one another to make sure we are all safer , more secure ** and more prosperous through continued friendship . '', 
  i heard an interesting quote from george orwell on the british monarchy saving britain from fascism :  ' a french journalist said to me once that the monarchy was one of the things that have saved britain from fascism . 
  what he meant was that modern people ca n't , apparently , get along without drums , flags and loyalty parades , and that it is better that they should tie their leader-worship into some figure who has no real power . 
  in a dictatorship the power and the glory belong to the same person . 
  in england the real power belongs to the unprepossessing men in bowler hats : the creature who rides in a gilded coach behind soldiers in steel breast-plates is really a waxwork . ', 
  the fact that the head of state is powerless is what has protected britain from the `` authoritarian crap '' ( although our government is becoming increasingly illiberal , hopefully it 's just a tide reflecting the current national mood that will gradually reside and is not a tsunami ) . 
  believing some ideas/values are superior to others is `` racist '' ? 
  the bbc journalist never mentioned the united states .
