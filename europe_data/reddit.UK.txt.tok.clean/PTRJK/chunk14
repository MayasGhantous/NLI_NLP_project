  does n't alexander dugin believe that russians have a divine right to `` absorb '' or rule over countries on russia 's periphery ? 
  is n't that a little bit racist ? 
  shortly after the interview , [ he apparently posted a blog calling the journalist a `` repulsive bastard '' , an `` utter cretin '' and a `` globalist swine '' . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/touowypukws?t=1165 ) although he did n't physically go nuts , he clearly did mentally . 
  i think ( s ) he 's referring to the prospect of scotland leaving the uk :  [ it is highly probable that scotland will hold a second independence referendum by 2020 if the uk is taken out of the eu single market , nicola sturgeon has said . 
  ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/nicola-sturgeon-second-scottish-referendum-likely-in-event-of-hard-brexit?client=safari ), 
  i 'm guessing he was sarcastically making a disparaging reference towards trump ... 
  i liked this analogy ( made prior to the referendum ) , [ ` uk risks ending its night in the kebab shop of europe '  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/4ltpzr/uk_risks_ending_its_night_in_the_kebab_shop_of/ )  i know there are problems with the eu but can anyone properly explain what our plan is if we leave ? 
   we have all been on a night out with a mate who when you are in a club says `` it 's shit here , let 's go somewhere else . '', 
  then when you leave you realise he has no idea where to go and the place you left wo n't let you back in . 
  without a decent follow up plan a leave vote could see the uk standing in a kebab shop arguing about who 's fault it is . 
  is it normal for terrorists to bring their residence papers with them as they commit a crime/act of terror ( let alone helpfully leaving it at the scene ) , when they evidently do n't want to get caught ? 
  seems a little odd . 
  not to forget the [ mulberry harbour ] ( https://www.britannica.com/topic/mulberry-artificial-harbours-world-war-ii ) , which was one of the greatest engineering feats in ww2 and was developed by the british in deep secrecy ( even the workers who were constructing it did n't know what they were constructing ) . 
  it was basically a giant portable harbour which was towed across the channel to facilitate the offloading of cargo onto beaches during the allied invasion of normandy . 
  the british returned to the continent on many occasions ... 
  notably * over * berlin . 
  it 's not like they just sat there and twiddled their thumbs between dunkirk and d-day . 
  i think you do your own county a disservice . 
  without british intelligence/espionage , sabotage , naval supremacy ( enabling the supply convoys to reach russia ) , controlling vital resources in north africa and the middle east from the nazi 's , bombing nazi factories and splitting up nazi forces between multiple fronts , the soviets might 've folded early and the nazi 's could 've occupied the whole of europe . 
  not to forget , d-day would not have been possible without britain and had the soviets managed to turn the tide against the nazi 's ( with or without the help from western allies ) , there would 've been nothing to stand in the way of the soviets from occupying the whole of europe . 
  had either the british empire , the americans , or the soviets been excluded from the war , i believe the nazi 's would 've been undefeated . 
  the saying is that ww2 was ultimately won by british brains , american brawn and russian blood . 
  so weird how some westerners have sympathies towards russian imperialism . 
  do n't countries on/near russia 's border have a right to self-determination ? 
  a right to decide their own country 's future ? 
  a right to join an alliance which protects their independence and territorial integrity ? 
  or must they reside themselves to being a satellite state of their bigger neighbour ? 
  should britain also be entitled to a sphere of influence over ireland and ireland be forced to leave the eu , now that britain is leaving ? 
  i thought we left the age of `` spheres of influence '' last century . 
  the reason why mexico and canada are n't joining an alliance against the united states is because they do n't want to and do n't need to . 
  in fact , far from calling for external reinforcements against the united states , many countries across the west ( including canada and mexico ) barely spend anything on their military because of the united states . 
  that 's the difference between america and russia . 
  stop creating a equivalency between the two ; as though they treat their neighbours equally and have the same respect for their borders , and as though a [ voluntary , us-led alliance is equal to russia 's conscripted sphere of influence .

  can we not send aid to grease to help cushion the austerity ? 
  maybe if the richer eu states help burden their welfare system slightly or give them things to build to help stimulate some growth their economy ? 
  sorry , i do n't know a lot about this so if that 's what the bailouts have effectively been doing or whether there would be even worse implications ?

  surely japan if anything , will want a closer relationship to the united states to protect it 's political/national interests etc. 
  * from * china ? 
  maybe depending on a reunification within this century , korea * might * turn away from the us and become to china what the uk is currently to the united states . 
  however , i think that would be about it . 
  because of what will be the massive economic weight of china , they ( the chinese ) wo n't really care to federate with another country ... as an analogy , it would be like the us ( currently worlds biggest super power ) creating a federation with the uk ( 1/6 of it 's size ) to give us ( the uk ) an equal division of power and relevance on the world stage . 
  since we 're on the topic , [ is france learning to love british food ?

  i do n't know , in what way is western europe 's culture specifically trying to be like america ?

  the [ director ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/ ) and [ the writer ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634300/ ) of the dark knight rises are also english , so would you say it 's just the studio ? 
  so just for fun , where would you place the film the lord of the rings ? 
  new zealand ( location of filming & directed by them ) , us ( many actors and funded by them ) or the uk ( many actors , the accents aswell as the book/concept written by them ) ? 
  [ gladiator ? 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/ ) uk ( actors , accents and directer ) , italian ( where it 's mainly set ) , american ( actors , money and written by them ) or new zealand with russel crow . 
  although i think batman is better set in the us for a few reasons i dont think ( if it were in the uk ) it would have to be in the least conventional , dated accent on london ( [ or would have to be like this either ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nmvwavrvaw&amp;list=hl1344605274&amp;feature=mh_lolz ) :p ) . 
  i mean even james bond would be a bit wierd with a cockney accent . 
  and to what you said in the last sentence , although it 's filmed in new york and the accents are mainly american , it 's fictionally set ( gotham city ) . 
  the script , directer and the main actors are mainly british . 
  or are you saying that its acted * as * which matters and not starred * by * which the british do mainly in both films if your not counting the backround actors such as civilians or police officers etc. 
  ( batman and harry potter ) . 
  edit ; i didnt mean this to come across as abit arrogant , im just trying to understand what aspect gives a film a nationalilty . 
  is it who 's being portrayed or is it who is being portrayed by who that matters and who actually produces it ? 
  well ... it 's all a bit globalised now but i think the brits have made quite a few good films with a variety of differant british actors , but i guess they are usually detected as american . 
  for example ; the latest batman film series is [ written ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634300/ ) , [ directed ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/ ) as well as starred by many brit 's such as [ the batman ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/ ) , [ bane ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362766/ ) , [ commissioner gorden ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000198/ ) and ofcourse , [ michael caine ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323/ ) . 
  although , they are usually funded or distributed by american company 's but then so is harry potter which is apparently considered british ... i dont know . 
  i know the batman concept is american though . 
  anything good ?

  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-is-best-place-in-europe-to-be-gay-7742348.html ) we 've finally made it to the top of a european league table in something positive !, 
  i understand that this is largely a pro-eu sub and people might be quick to defend it , but it seems to be ( at least from the british perspective ) [ one of the major reasons for eu scepticism . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euidyj2_s9g ) i was thinking about how globalisation works ( or how the world would become one country ) and i think countries/unions should expand like bubbles merging with similar bubbles , homogenising into one coherent bubble , multiplying in size and so on , until the final two can merge . 
  however , i think the eu 's bubble has probably inflated too big , too quickly and it * might * just burst . 
  although it 's still not too late ( or at least it 's something to fall back on if the eu fails ) , do you think a better path to a european union would have been merging smaller regions of europe first , that are closer together ( e.g. 
  linguistically , culturally , geographically , economically , politically etc. 
  ) , into homogeneous unions/country 's ? 
  in fact , if the countries in the unions were not only more alike , but the number of countries and people were also on a more manageable scale , people might accept closer union at faster pace .
