  i think richer or poorer , including the small countries that have struck lucky with big oil reserves , we ( nato ) should all make the same sacrifice for the common course , by chipping in * at least * the nato minimum of 2 % of gdp . 
  yeah , but if we began to build more nuclear plants today , it would still leave a decade or so before they can be used to produce electricity and even then , most people ( at least in the uk ) will still depend on gas for heating their homes and [ many other applications ] ( https://www.columbiagasva.com/images/content-body/natural-gas-uses.jpg?sfvrsn=2 ) . 
  in fact , there will probably always be an application for gas and a need to extract it , so long as it exists . 
  also electricity from gas is cheaper than nuclear , so unless you do n't mind energy bills going up ... 
  i suppose , maybe the two can complement each other ( low cost/low carbon energy ) , until other greener forms of energy become better value for money and more reliable .

  passage quoted in full :  ` how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries ! , ' wrote churchill . 
   ` besides the fanatical frenzy , which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog , there is this fearful fatalistic apathy . 
   ` the effects are apparent in many countries . 
  improvident habits , slovenly systems of agriculture , sluggish methods of commerce , and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live . 
   ' a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement ; the next of its dignity and sanctity . 
   ` the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property -- either as a child , a wife , or a concubine -- must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men . 
   ` thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith : all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it . 
   ` no stronger retrograde force exists in the world . 
  far from being moribund , mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith . ',

  but today 's electronic trading networks transcend national boundaries . 
  trades are routed to the computer that offers them the highest liquidity and the lowest transaction costs . 
  trading will migrate to trading centers that are not subject to the tax , and companies may choose to list on foreign exchanges . 
  over time , the loss of trading will threaten the u.s. leadership in financial services and reduce employment in the broker-dealer and affiliated industries . '', 
  unless this is implemented world wide , it 's not a good news for the uk 's and europe 's competitiveness in financial services and may specifically threaten london 's * global * lead . 
  but i 'm guessing not many people here care . 
  most of those of those are pretty questionable . 
  not just whether they 're inherently right-wing , but also whether they 're accurate . 
  for example ; has ukip said it ** denies ** climate change , or ** opposes ** gay marriage etc. 
  if limits on immigration were right wing , is it right wing of labour to support limits on immigration outside the eu ? 
  or in other words , to oppose the eu completely opening up its borders to the rest of the world ? 
  also labour and the conservatives want to make it more difficult for non-eu citizens to emigrate here , than ukip would like . 
   [ a look at the immigration policies of the four main parties show that actually , ukip 's policy is the most open towards non-white migration . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/nigel-farage-my-response-to-barbara-roche-9301378.html ) they do support greater cuts in public spending , or * maybe * various privatisations in the nhs ** but ** they also support [ the tax payer getting better value for money . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01ccbm9 ) if they think they can get the same , if not better service in the nhs for less money , while helping to get our deficit under control , left or right-wing , that 's good news for everybody . 
  so it 's not quite so black and white , left or right . 
   ukip are further right than conservatives i think that 's probably a misconception . 
  remember their goal is european independence , so they 've got to attract people from all sides of the ( left/right ) spectrum and [ they seem to be having some success . 
  ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4074563.ece ) ukip are supposed to be a classical liberal , middle-ground of british public opinion party . 
  the only way they could be said to be right-wing is that they support free market economics ( although not unfettered ) because they believe it offers a better result for more people , than state control and state enterprise . 
  whether you agree it does ... that 's another argument . 
  but otherwise they support things like reducing tuition fees , not taxing people earning less than 12k a year or earning minimum wage .

  all countries want closer ties with each other , in one form or another . 
  switzerland has a free trade agreement with china . 
  is it so ridiculous to imagine britain and any/every nation in the commonwealth * might * want to do the same ? 
  i 'm just bewildered how you can be so against and so certain of it ? 
   the eu is ultimately the way forward . 
  it 's your choice . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
   as for the commonwealth , it 's hogwash . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  i think the difference is that the uk is a union of countries with their own national identity , while germany is single country with devolved regions . 
  ` devo max ' would be most of scotland 's preferred choice in the referendum , but i think further devolution would just postpone the inevitable , while in the eu . 
  when the eu finally takes over things like our defence and foreign affairs , westminster would become an unnecessary link ( or middleman ) between the federalised countries in the uk and the federal eu . 
  personally , i 'm in favour of the uk becoming more federalised ( like you said ) , but i think the uk 's relationship with europe should be purely economic ( possibly [ efta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_trade_association ) ) , while the continent can fully steam ahead with a ` united states of europe . ', 
  i think that 's the closest thing we can get to `` best of both worlds '' and i think the eu and the uk would both be happier for it , as our governments clearly want two different directions for europe . 
  if we played our cards right , we could also build an economic relationship between the countries in the commonwealth ( a market of $ 13 trillion , growing by 7 % a year ) and our country would be in an even more desirable position for trade than we are now , with economic access to what could potentially be two superpowers .

  you ca n't have your cake and eat it ( keep the uk * and * stay in the eu ) . 
  with the eu treaty of ` ever closer union ' , the eu has been slowly replacing the uk and will eventually replace the uk entirely . 
  i think many scots already see westminster as the unnecessary middleman between them and the eu . 
  we either ; stay in the eu and the uk inevitably dissolves into four , separate european states . 
  or , we leave the eu and try to salvage a uk . 
  but we ca n't and wo n't have it both ways , as much as some of us like the status quo . 
  or to put it another way : imposing the idea of a new nationality upon people who 've never given consent for it . 
  far from that being a project that will bring peace and harmony , it will actually breed the very extremisms and nationalisms that the project sought to stamp out in the first place . 
  the british people voted for a common market . 
  they never voted for a political union with a european flag , an anthem or president herman van rompuy .

  also , it 's probably a safer investment than sending your own armoured vehicles up directly against theirs and giving them a fighting chance to destroy millions of pounds of your armoured equipment . 
  although , i know when we sent our challenger 1 tanks to iraq in the first gulf war , they destroyed over 300 ( russian made ) iraqi tanks without suffering a single loss . 
  it was sort of like holding a midget at an arms length .

  i think europe will eventually become a united superpower , but by the time it happens it will be too little , too late compared to other superpowers at that time . 
  india will definitely become * the * super power . 
  in 50 years it will have a population larger than both china and the usa combined . 
  i think ( power and influence wise ) by the late 21st/early 22nd century , the usa will be to the world what the uk was to the world in the late half of the 20th century/pre-financial crisis . 
  who knows , they could eventually become india 's lapdog ... 
  however , what i think is more likely to happen is that they will be part of a ` northern alliance ' , a union of superpowers ( which stems from nato ) with north america , the eu and russia to counter asia and africa .
