  maybe south america would be part of the alliance as they share similar values and interests , although i 'm guessing they will be a more neutral superpower ? 
  i 'd like to think that the [ commonwealth of nations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations ) would also be in it or may be its very own ` northern alliance ' / hyperpower , but ` savannajeff ' will have a go at me . 
   high earners simply moved their declared income to benefit the most before tax rates increased . 
  that led to a 1-year spike in tax revenue . 
  that accounted for all of the # 9 billion , or are n't there any figures ? 
  in which case , how can you say * `` thats not really evidence . 
  if anything it shows ... '' * ? 
  if anything it shows which ever side you want to believe or dismiss . 
  i 'm not dismissing either side but i think this still counts as evidence that supports the claim . 
  although , we 'd probably have to wait until next year to really see who 's right and by how much . 
  i wonder what our unskilled unemployment rate is , considering that that 's the demographic which is supposedly negatively affected by mass immigration ? 
  we have 20 % youth unemployment , which are likely to be the least skilled of any age group . 
  i imagine it 's tough for our unskilled workers because , while they do n't have greener pastures ( i.e. 
  unskilled work ) to emigrate to in the eu , their pastures are heavily saturated by skilled/unskilled europeans , that we 've inherited from countries with extremely high unemployment rates . 
  it 's also driving down wages for them because of the increasing supply of unemployed workers for businesses to choose from , along with competing with people from far poorer countries , who work for far less money . 
  but as long as our skilled , middle-class get to emigrate to other countries more freely ( resulting in the uk becoming more dependent on foreign workers to fill the increasing skills shortage , many of who send their money back to their families in poorer countries ) then sod our unskilled , working class . 
  [ actually , there is evidence that reducing taxes for the rich ( i imagine up until a point ) increases the amount of money they pay into government coffers .

  bit late here , but i 've found a map comparing countries ` racial tolerance ' : http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/, 
  thank you for the sermon , colonist . 
  but , can you change `` you '' to `` we '' . 
  your country/ancestors were just as much a part of the empire as mine was . 
  you could even say that modern britons bare less guilt of colonialism than the colonists do . 
  unless you 've recently migrated to or from australia , in which case how do/did you enjoy the `` damages '' you berate the british for ? 
  like the little anglo cluster at the bottom left . 
  the bbc recently made a programme on why the british were right to enter the first world war and oppose germany 's war aims : [ the necessary war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wujg5vs99c ) it goes into some detail on what you 're talking about . 
  no , we 've been acknowledging it for centuries . 
  our job more recently has been to keep russia out and germany down , to insure that anglo ( or as we politely put it ` western ' ) values continue to dominate europe . 
  so germany 's pacifism is understandable , even intended . 
  it 's just slightly frustrating that they 're still devoutly abiding by it , now that their values/interests are more in line with ours . 
  we 're the eurozone 's biggest export market and trading partner . 
  they sell us more than they sell to china , usa etc. 
  we might do worse in the rankings but scotland might have a fair few problems of their own : [ windfarmaction ] ( http://windfarmaction.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/energy-bills-would-soar-in-an-independent-scotland/ ) - * '' mr davey told the scottish renewables conference in edinburgh that scotland receives a quarter of the uk 's renewable power subsidies , with 10 per cent of the population . 
  '' * * `` the uk protects scottish consumers from the full costs of power generation . 
  in the uk , scotland 's households pay less than they would in scotland alone . 
  '' * * `` maintaining this support would take up a greater proportion of national finances , meaning higher taxes , higher energy bills or cuts in other areas . '' * [ the daily record ] ( http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/independent-scotland-could-see-renewable-1119009 ) - * `` a global energy consultancy has warned that investment in renewable energy `` will start to dry up '' if subsidies drop after independence . 
  '' * * `` af-mercados told a uk parliament committee that power firms can not assume they will be get the same level of financial support as there is now . 
  the population of the united states grew by the entire population of germany , in only 28 years ... holy shit . 
  beats me , but we seem to be spending plenty on ' [ operations & amp ; maintenance expenditure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union ) ' ( scroll down to the big table ) . 
  i think along with the incompetent decision making , general inefficiencies and waste , our government is more interested in supporting british jobs and making corporate favours , than getting bang for our buck . 
  [ here 's the full debate on youtube . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6hy8kyedja ), 
   `` firstly , there 's nothing stopping any other country from competing with ireland in the same basis in the areas of tax . '', 
  there 's a couple of things . 
  it will mean we 'll either ; have to raise taxes somewhere else to make up for the losses , or make cuts to government spending and forgo our obligations/commitments , that it entails . 
  it 's easy for ireland to afford such generous corporation tax arrangements when you spend next to nothing on your military and free-load off nato by being neutral , on the dishonest , sanctimonious and frankly ungrateful grounds of it being `` morally superior . '', 
  i do n't think the irish would have appreciated the allies adopting neutrality during ww2 or the cold war ( like they did ) . 
  it was n't neutrality that stopped iraq from invading kuwait , or communist north korea from invading south korea , or the islamic extremist from taking over mali and so on . 
  unfortunately , some countries feel they have an obligation to the international community and sometimes decide to take responsibility , making sacrifices in blood and treasure in order for us to live in a world of peace , prosperity and stability , where sovereignty , human rights and liberties are defended . 
  while other countries like to take advantage of that fact and act as a drain on their economies . 
  to be bluntly honest , ireland is a pointless [ parasitic ] ( http://www.allvoices.com/news/15834970-luxembourg-is-a-rogue-state-ireland-a-parasite-state-says-french-mp ) country :p not only does ireland take from the world but it also does n't give anything back . 
  the irish try to deceive us of otherwise , with pretty rainbows but they only care about one thing , their pot of gold . 
  '' * / irish leprechaun laughter . 
  [ they probably have a few other reasons . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/07/us-yahoo-europe-tax-idusbrea160y420140207 ), 
  sorry , poland . 
  annexation only works with weaker countries that ca n't defend themselves . 
  :( perhaps poland can annex glasgow if scotland becomes independent , as a consolation prize ? 
  [ yeah ... 
  i tried it with poland ( sorry , poland ) . 
  the british psyche : `` our country is awful , but everywhere else is worse . '', 
  * [ `` number of research papers published in 2012 by * leading * scientific nations , and the proportion of each country 's research this year ( 2012 ) that is in the top one percent of most-cited papers . 
  '' ] ( http://sapienzalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cube-map_web.jpg ) * [ the number of publications and percentage of excellence of scientific production , 2003-11 ] ( http://www.scienzainrete.it/files/figure_3.7.1_the_quantity_and_quality_of_scientific_production_2003-11.jpg ) seems to be that we 're doing more with less ... not that i 'm justifying that we should be spending less than other european countries . 
  i think this is one of the things that we should be spending more money on . 
  i think he 's referring to the word `` dole '' itself . 
  we do n't really hear the word used outside of the uk , hence he assumed you were from the uk . 
  anyway , stop being so touchy . 
  he was being polite to you and apologised for his mistake . 
  the flag might stay the same but it would lose some meaning . 
  it would no longer represent an entity called britain and it could no longer be referred to as the `` british '' flag . 
  the flag would represent something new and slightly confusing to foreigners called the rest of the uk or the former uk . 
  so we can effectively wave good buy to our british brand abroad and for us ; much of our british history , achievements and the british identity . 
  `` british '' would have an equivalent meaning/significance to us , as `` scandinavian '' does to sweden , norway ... scotland ( according to some anyway ) . 
  the whole segment ( the guardian did n't include ) : `` the uk should not support ** for now ** trade sanctions or close london 's financial centre to russians . '', 
  so ( with those two words ) it 's not quite as spineless , self-serving and ` off the table ' as the guardian implies . 
  forgive me if that seems reasonable , as maybe it 's too soon to be resorting to shooting ourselves in the foot with economic sanctions ( as it is too soon for military action ) when it could still be resolved by talks and besides , i do n't see anybody else jumping at the opportunity to wave their biggest economic stick at russia . 
  i have n't seen germany stopping its car exports to russia . 
  i hate that when i put some effort into my comments , someone just responds with `` no , i disagree . '', 
  what 's your reason i 'm wrong ? 
  why would it not be in russia 's interest to have a bordering country that 's friendly to russia , where russia 's strategic military ports for the mediterranean is located for its black fleet and having the opportunity to expand its customs union ? 
  when you 're left with either an entire neighbouring country possibly joining the eu/west or splitting off the pro-russian half and getting a buffer-zone to the eu , which do you think will be in their best interest ? 
  which do you think was in china 's interest during the korean war ( yes , it was n't for * all * the same reasons but they share some of them ) ? 
  what i think will realistically happen : * lots of messy diplomacy and rhetoric for the next few weeks/months . 
  * it will eventually be agreed that the ukraine should split-up into west ukraine ( pro-europe ) and east ukraine ( pro-russia ) , along the dnieper river . 
  at least , i think that 's what russia and eastern ukraine/crimea wants . 
  * however , if that diplomatic solution is not reached ( worst-case scenario ) ; russia annexes eastern ukraine and crimea , which will ruffle a lot of feathers in the international community . 
  however , after realising that there 's probably no alternative solution , along with the vocal public support from the pro-russian eastern ukrainians ( who are basically russians anyway ) , it will be eventually be accepted by the international community without any western military intervention . 
  if by `` winning '' you mean `` losing , but has recently been gaining ground ? '', 
   the military should be for defence only . 
  is that just self-defence ? 
  what about another ( non-european ) country 's defence ? 
  if so , our military would require some `` global reach '' to insure the defence of another country and may even require some * offence * to insure one side completely stops attacking or does n't attack again ( as your country knows first hand ) . 
  or is it a case of `` it 's their problem , not ours ? '', 
  in that selfish case ; what pacifists seem to forget is that what at happens abroad * does * effect us , whether we take action to control the outcome or not . 
  in other words , inaction can have consequences for us , just as taking action does . 
  i think as we do n't belong in the eurozone , we might seem a lot less relevant to other european countries . 
  we 'll make their news less often than france and germany ... we 'll generally have a lot less presence , which europeans might associate with having less significance globally than france and germany . 
  also , [ how much our economy ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:gbr:deu:fra ) and defence spending has shrunk in resent years compared to other european countries , along with having such a political lightweight as pm ; people in their 20 's who are just learning about the world might think that our present position in europe and the world has always been the case ( in living memory ) . 
  [ no they 're not .
