  the cruise missiles you have need to be fired from aircraft , but . . [ we also have those and much more of them ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/storm_shadow ), 
  in what way is france militarily ahead of the uk ? 
  i know the uk has a marginally bigger defence budget , but from what i understand we both have different military doctrines , so they 're difficult to compare ( we might be more capable in one area , but less so in another ) . 
  for example ; you current ' y have an aircraft carrier capability that we do n't have ( our current carrier capability is a joke ) , but we have a cruise-missile launching submarine capability you do n't have . 
  the two super carriers wo n't be ready for at least another 5 years . 
  you can see the [ latest progress here , ] ( https://twitter.com/qeclasscarriers/media ) if you 're interested . 
  just be be clear , i 'm not going draw up some commonwealth treaties and then argue them out over the internet . 
  can you accept that there are benefits with working with other countries on a number of issues and the commonwealth could be potentially a good platform to use ? 
  this is n't just about the uk and what it can offer . 
  there might be a common interest where we can coordinate or combine our recourses/efforts to relieve various burdens and create a bigger impact . 
  here are some possible examples for you to shoot down : * a space agency - australia does n't have an esa equivalent , correct ? 
  * research funding - science , engineering etc. 
  * defence equipment commonality . 
  * international cooperation on problems such piracy ( naval ) , terrorism etc. 
  look at the [ objectives of the african union . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african_union#overview ) it does n't have to be all about having a single market . 
  in fact i think the commonwealth could resemble many aspects of the african union . 
  how are you all making the assumption that the british specifically want a free trade pact with the commonwealth ? 
  i have n't said anything about what the defining roles of the commonwealth should be . 
  i 'm open minded to the possibility that the commonwealth could have some potential uses . 
  the uk could still have a free trade agreement with the eu after leaving . 
  she seems to be among the top searched in mexico too . 
  i looked her up and i do n't see what 's so special about her . 
  can anyone else in the uk clue me in ? 
  i think it should be a goal to work towards . 
  a lot needs to be fixed along the way , though . 
  i 'm not sure about whether britain 's future belongs to it or whether the united kingdom would be compatible with further integration . 
  if the eu takes over many more of the responsibilities the uk has for its four countries , there would be less reasons for the uk to exist and it would probably mean the breakup of the uk , as we 're already beginning to see . 
  it would at least make it a lot harder for the prime-minister to justify keeping the uk together , which is probably why we seem so opposed to further integration . 
  in my ** personal ** opinion ( i get it will be unpopular with the uk europhiles ) we leave europe to form its own superstate , while we reform the archaic uk and pursue our own path with the commonwealth and americans . 
  do n't worry chaps , [ two more 's on the way !, 
  ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lrgx_d9w5x8/uphbxhobrhi/aaaaaaaaaom/vhch0wtmy04/s1600/queen+elizabeth+class.jpg ), 
  i remember watching the film ` gallipoli ' in history class . 
  apparently ( according to my history teacher ) , the arrogant colonel who was portrayed as an englishman in the film , was in fact an australian of the ` australian imperial force ' . 
  edit : i think it was col. robinson ? 
   there 's zero chance the uk economy will pass the german or french ones , uk will be lucky to hold its third place by 2030 yes , we 've kind of got the gist that you think that it wo n't happen but ` why ' ? 
  why , when the uk 's population is expected be the biggest in europe in 30 years and it was only a few years ago , before the financial crisis , it had [ the second biggest economy in europe . 
  ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:gbr:deu:fra#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:gbr:deu:fra:rom&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  it could , but unlike with the uk there 's nothing to back up the possibility . 
  you 're country 's population would have to grow fourfold , but you 're expected to shrink by a few million in the next few decades . 
  there would have to be some kind of collapse of civilisation in western europe to make romania europe 's largest economy happen in a few decades . 
  i get your point but it 's not anywhere as ridiculous and unfounded as you 're making it out to be . 
  i do n't get why is this so hard to believe ? 
  what reputation has the uk built up around europe that makes this seem so ridiculous to everybody ? 
  obviously a lot can change within 20/30 years but that 's the direction the current data ( population/economic growth etc ) is pointing . 
  eurostat - [ `` in 2060 , the member states with the largest populations would be the united kingdom ( 79 million ) , france ( 74 mn ) , germany ( 66 mn ) , italy ( 65 mn ) and spain ( 52 mn ) . 
  it 's not that far-fetched . 
  [ the uk 's gdp was hot on germany 's tail before the 2008 financial crisis ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:gbr:deu:fra ) and that 's with a population difference of about 20 million . 
  couple that with uk 's population growing to 70 million by 2030 and germany 's shrinking population , it 's plausible . 
  [ the uk 's population is also predicted to be the biggest in europe within the next 30 years . 
  ] ( http://www.airo.ie/news/europe-2060-population-projections-ireland-increase-465-interact-data ) obviously a lot can change in that amount of time though . 
  well , it 's already happening whether we like it or not . 
  [ `` as economic and cultural globalization and development continue to push forward , growing numbers of languages will become endangered and eventually , extinct . 
  with increasing economic integration on national and regional scales , people find it easier to communicate and conduct business in the dominant lingua francas of world commerce : english , chinese , spanish and french . 
  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extinct_language ), 
  i think you 're a bit ignorant on the subject mate , to be making such outspoken statements . 
  :p you 're not wrong about the wrong doings of the british empire you pointed out , though . 
  i 'm not taking either side but why do you believe this ? 
  i 'm not too worried whether europe will eventually be speaking one language . 
  i 'm sure eventually the whole world will be speaking one language anyway , let alone europe . 
  although , it probably wo n't be like anything we could recognise today , i 'd rather it stemmed from a european language which is currently the global lingua franca and has the biggest chance of lasting against mandarin . 
  i 'm assuming one of the reasons why britain is against the eu having a common defence and foreign policy , or more specifically its prime minister ` david cameron ' is because it would threaten the future of the uk . 
  there would be less of a reason for the uk to exist if the eu takes over one of the uk 's major roles for england , scotland , wales and northern ireland . 
  that 's one of the reasons why i think the scottish want independence because they already see the eu as their new uk . 
  it 's no longer in their national interest to be part of this political union . 
  what i am against is the uk paralysing the eu for its own personal interest . 
  i think we should either accept the uk 's finished or we leave the political union of europe , [ reform the uk ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-23919439 ) , renegotiate a free trade agreement with the eu and create our own european union with the [ commonwealth of nations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_nations ) , without the unnecessary ( as we perceive it ) ` bells and whistles ' . 
  the uncompetitive economic policies , having a federal superstate army which also has a democratic deficit etc. 
  what do you mean ? 
  would i support another language ( say ` deutsch ' ) being europe 's official second language if it was the most globally dominant european language or would i still support what i said if english was n't my native language ? 
  i stand by my reasoning whatever the language . 
  it just make the most sense . 
  people * want * to speak it , whether it 's to improve their future prospects [ ( in a vast number of fields ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_language#significance ) or because of the prevalence of anglo media . 
  let 's use the language that is already the most prevalent in europe and worldwide and help prevent the worlds language from being the runner-up , ` mandarin . ', 
  [ well it 's going both ways ... ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10258081/two-million-quit-britain-in-talent-drain.html ) i mean the pay might not be as generous in eastern european countries as it is here but their cost living is much lower . 
   according to the oecd , a total of 1.28 million highly-skilled british citizens are now living abroad , significantly more than any other developed economy . 
   there are 865,000 highly-skilled german citizens living abroad , and almost 400,000 highly skilled us citizens who have chosen to emigrate . 
  there are obvious benefits with being able to communicate with the rest of the world , which i think are more important than preventing two european states from having an unfair advantage , so it might as well be english . 
  more and more people are speaking english because everybody else is . 
  it would be better to support the most widespread european language that 's spreading naturally , rather than forcibly speak another language that no one else in the world speaks and end up all speaking mandarin anyway because it 's the most common global language . 
  we should feel lucky that there is a european language so widespread in the first place , that we can all relate to and it is n't one of those completely foreign ( to europe ) asian/middle eastern languages with weird characters . 
  we should take advantage of it . 
  ireland 's imposes extremely generous tax rules to allow it to attract enormous amounts of foreign capital . 
  if ireland is not a tax haven , then what is ? 
  apparently there 's been a [ european probe into multinationals ' tax deals in ireland ] ( http://www.independent.ie/business/european-probe-into-multinationals-tax-deals-in-ireland-29572366.html ) . 
  * `` the probe follows massive controversy in the united states , britain , germany and france about the low taxes charged on us companies with operations in ireland . 
  '' * what ever ireland 's status is , its unique generous tax arrangements seems to be a problem , not just for the uk . 
  point being maybe it 's ireland that needs to fall back into line and not for the rest of the world to follow this race to the bottom . 
  you 'll have to understand that ireland has been appearing in the news a lot lately in the uk about its favourable taxes or fiscal conditions and how large multinational corporations are taking advantage of it , avoiding paying their tax in the uk , which also allows them to unfairly compete with our businesses based in the uk . 
  for example : [ ` double irish with a dutch sandwich ' ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-irish-with-a-dutch-sandwich.asp ) so there 's going to be a little bitterness , not because we 're out of the top ten in a forbes magazine but because we view ireland ( to put it bluntly on this issue ) as this inconvenient parasite next door which threatens our businesses/jobs and taxes . 
  they 're both massive financial centres but it 's said that `` new york serves the usa , london serves the world . '', 
  were n't the anti-immigration posters submitted by readers of the guardian , not the british government ? 
  it was only considered by the british government . 
  to be honest it seemed like it was just an opportunity to mock ourselves , rather than to keep the romanians away . 
  for example ; the one that said something like `` the only reason why we have n't left is because our transport system is n't working '' . 
  so i would not take the posters too personally or seriously either because it was just us having fun poking fun at ourselves . 
   there is that old joke that only british cuisine and british women could make such a great nation of sailors . 
  that 's probably where the famous `` gay '' stereotype about sailors came from ... 
  sometimes you 've got ta laugh at yourself . 
  not in the anglosphere , i 'm afraid .
