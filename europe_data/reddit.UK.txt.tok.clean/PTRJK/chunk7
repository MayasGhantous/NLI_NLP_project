   the point is that farage opposes all immigration to the uk . 
  when has he or ukip stated that ? 
  i thought they were just against the total open door policy to immigration . 
  where 's gibraltar ? 
  edit : sorry spain ... ? 
  i was just wondering why it was n't included . 
   and cutting spendings , reducing deficit . 
  well , that was also the intention of our socialist pm harold wilson who raised the top rate of tax to 83 % in 1974 . 
  but if fran\u00e7ois hollande is doing what he promised and is getting the results , fine . 
  if that 's also your view of the unions , fine . 
  although the impression i was getting was different , i surrender . 
  i do n't really have the stomach to get drawn into a political debate about your proud country , france . 
  i was referring [ to this ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/business/global/talk-of-nationalization-gets-new-life-in-france.html?_r=0 ) when i mentioned protectionist nationalizations . 
  although upon further reading , it was in fact just a threat made by the french government if ` arcelormittal ' partially closed the steal plant and arcelormittal has since backed down . 
  there is no arguing that france is * very * protectionist compared to its european neighbours though , which is another similarity between france and the uk in the 1970 's . 
  ** edit : ** and here 's another similarity but which is more subjective . 
  the uk was known as the ` sick man of europe ' in 1970 and france , much more recently . 
  http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/3021901-sick-man-europe-france http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sick_man_of_europe#united_kingdom, 
  i get the feeling that france is going down the same road as britain was in 1970 's . 
  a socialist leader implementing high taxes , protectionist nationalizations , the militant unions and the big , vague concern of `` declinism '' , an obsession with the idea that britain had `` no future '' , to name a few ... 
  you 've got to be kidding me . 
  her funeral is going to be a national embarrassment . 
  never mind , it 's gunna be well funny ` innit ? 
  you must be an unloved dim-wit if you have to draw your moral guidance from a news paper . 
  if you loved anybody , you 'd know that their death would be a sensitive time . 
  i guess you also support the west borough baptist church protesting at the funerals of dead solders . 
  i sometimes ca n't believe what i 'm hearing . 
  you guys sound like the kind of people who are simply abusive to people on the grounds of freedom of speech . 
  as though you feel entitled to being an inconsiderate , selfish , disrespectful arse-hole because the government wo n't persecute you for it . 
  how can you compare her to hitler ? 
  she was n't a fucking genocidal , fascist megalomaniac . 
  she defeated the ungovernable fascist left and her work helped bring peace to eastern and western europe . 
  what will protesting achieve at her funeral anyway ? 
  it wo n't change your predicament or anything for that matter except , causing her family grief and creating allot of tensions and hurt amongst the crowd . 
  it 's stupid and you disrespectful chavs are really fucked up . 
  i agree with his sentiment . 
  we do have an unhealthy obsession with welfare which generally speaking , discourages aspiration and undermines our work ethic . 
  a lot of people would rather we cut every public sector job , our investment in our economy and increase tax before cutting spending to our # 170bn welfare programme . 
  as well as preferring that we 'd lower the ceiling on wealth by squeezing the rich and putting a cap on success , more than raise the floor by increasing living standards and reducing the cost of living through tax cuts , more economic investment and creating more job opportunities . 
  and i agree that people are over dependant on the state to manage their lives . 
  it 's also frustrating seeing parents having to phone the police to discipline their out of control kids or depending on teachers to bring them up . 
  too much state control may lead to a more caring state but less caring individuals and a society . 
  change however , can only start from the top . 
  i 'm not against welfare entirely but the system we have should be changed . 
  not only is it counter productive discouraging people to work or save for their own pension , it also costs too much . 
  if we did n't have welfare and someone suddenly suggested we spend # 170bn on it , i 'd think they were mad . 
  it should be in it 's tens of billions , not hundreds of billions . 
  ** edit : ** ideas ; what would you guys think of privatising the benefit system and having ` unemployment insurance ' instead ? 
  where you could pay so much a month based on your income . 
  an incentive for getting another job would be ( like car insurance ) the more often you claim and how much you claim , the higher your premium will be . 
  also scrapping state payed pensions , at least for people working in the private sector but keeping the incapacity or disability benefit ? 
  so they keep working until they ca n't instead of simply no longer wanting to . 
  and we can force people like surgeons in the public sector to retire at a certain age on safety grounds . 
  there 's also nothing stopping private businesses ( like in america ) to offer pensions to their employees . 
  i think the shores of the falklands and argentina are about the same distance apart as the shores of the uk and norway . 
  not only that , the falklands are around 100 miles out of argentina 's 200 mile economic zone . 
  at that range , i could n't bring myself to care but maybe i 'm just biased . 
  to reinforce what the other guy who responded to you said , the gibraltans had a referendum on that 10 years ago , however [ this was the reaction ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2124330.stm ) and [ this was the outcome . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2416349.stm ), 
  i found a good little video uploaded today , which is a '' [ look back at ` british forces germany 's ' ( bfg ) post war beginnings ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5h3mbxzmm ) '' . 
  i can understand our role in slavery was nothing to be proud of , but on the other hand we were the first of the major western slave-trading nations to abolish it . 
  and personally , i do n't see much shame in people being compensated for it either . 
  the investments they made at the time were well within the confines of the law and they should be compensated if the government suddenly makes it illegal . 
  let alone this occurring 200 years ago , in no persons living memory, 
  i 'm aware of the benefits of having the royal family such as the money they pay to the state , the tourism they bring and the way they can bring the country together but if i had it my way , i think * we * should become a republic after queen elizabeth dies , while the royal family is still highly regarded . 
  maybe we could be called the ` republic of great britain and ireland ' . 
  there 's also the issue of flags . 
  would the irish accept the northern irish [ st patrick 's saltire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:st_patrick%27s_saltire.svg ) as their national flag again and have the [ union flag ] ( http://www.foursquaregb.org/images/union_combination.jpg ) to represent our new union or , should we [ remove st patrick 's saltire ] ( http://warof1812symes4.pbworks.com/f/1300070923/british%20flag.gif ) from the union flag and have the [ two separate ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/flags/newflags/ei-lgflag.gif ) flags to represent our two islands ? 
  ideally the first for logistical reasons but i guess the irish would vote for the latter . 
  or we could have a green , white and orange union flag ... not really to my taste though . 
  edited flag names, 
  i do n't know much about what the various economic or political outcomes would be as a result of their independents , but in my personal opinion as an englishman , it would just be a shame considering our history and everything we 've been through together . 
  that and what would happen to our flag . 
  also , ( sorry , slightly leading off topic ) it would be a shame for our union to end in such a way . 
  i 'd rather we decentralise power from england and became a coalition of four countries . 
  like a mini eu , outside the eu while still remaining in the european economic and free trade area . 
  we could then give the republic of ireland an incentive for joining us with the promise of seeding n ireland back to them . 
  northern ireland would still be a part of the uk ( or whatever name or form it takes ) as much as any other country in it and ireland would be reunited . 
  there are four counties with each pm elected once every 4 years ... ? 
  they could each take it in turns to head the coalition for 1 year . 
  we would n't become so much ` the singapore ' of the west but more like the japan of the west and the uk is predicted to be the biggest economy amongst the eu in 50 years anyway ... 
  so maybe not a european satellite but maybe a european moon tugging in the tides of europe . 
  pros : good compromise for the scots wanting independence and the english wanting independence from the the eu . 
  ireland is reunited and northern ireland is still part of the ` uk ' as well as being a stronger presence on the world stage . 
  sort of . 
  i think we should become a bit more pacifist . 
  why am i being downvoted for submitting a news item ? 
  what did i do wrong ? 
  we brits and germans seem to make a habit of this sort of thing . 
  i 'm quite surprised we share allot of names with sweden . 
  the only names i do n't recognise over here in the uk are elias and filip . 
  you mean hypocritical ? 
  i do n't get the irony . 
  * personnel . 
  [ a break down of which country did what ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/may/22/nato-libya-data-journalism-operations-country#zoomed-picture ) in libya for anyone who 's interested . 
  [ here 's what i think should happen ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/14keuk/how_does_ruk_feel_about_northern_ireland/c7e1ds8 ) . 
  although that would probably depend on being more independent from the eu and becoming more like norway or switzerland . 
  i could n't say for certain ... again , it just showed the ` scientifically leading ' european countries which seems to have excluded a lot of countries in the eastern part of the eu . 
  so the population in the context would be around 450 million . 
  we 're not behind ... ?
