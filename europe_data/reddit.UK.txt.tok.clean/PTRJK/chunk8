  which or what part is the eu behind on compared to the us ? 
  it should also be said that all of the eastern european countries except poland and the czech republic , were excluded as apparently they are n't ` scientifically leading ' countries . 
  so , the population in this case would be closer to 450 million . 
  wow , we 're bigger than france and germany ... :p ( it 's just you ) . 
  also relevant : 500,000,000 in the european union . 
  i think if you take the mean average among the eu countries it 's about 1.28, 
  ca n't believe i 'm tallying this up ... all the eu countries showing : 488,765 ( excluding russia ) usa : 311,975 not sure where most of eastern europe is though . 
  they were highlighted on the map . 
  i think they should round it up to at least 500,000 for the eu . 
  nice try polish immigrant who has n't contributed anything to british cuisine . 
  but seriously , without immigrants nobody would live here , which i also do n't think has anything to do ` cbfw86 ' point . 
  he 's talking about why he thinks the british economy is helping poland 's , not being anti-immigrant or xenophobic ? 
  more like the titanic . 
  we can * still compare ourselves with russia in some respects . 
  our economy ( despite it shrinking by four ukraine 's in the financial crisis ) is [ still bigger the russias ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:gbr&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=uk%20gdp#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:gbr:rus&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) ... our unique relationship with countries such as the usa and former colonies belonging to the commonwealth ( canada and australia especially ) also puts us in a good standing against russia .

  still quite easy to compare the two . 
  i 'm guessing it 's a sign of insecure property rights and ineffective law enforcement , during the period which the houses were built ? 
  having homes surrounded by big walls like fortresses ( especially in rural areas ) is quite common in the middle east as well . 
  according to the guardian article , `` britain has provided # 1bn in aid to the region since 2012 '' . 
  so , i think it 's since the civil war started , to before cameron 's recent commitment to provide an additional # 100 million ( bringing the total to # 1 billion ) . 
  [ how much eu countries have given in foreign aid to syrian refugees . 
   it 's largely your countries fault that these refugees exist in the first place [ who ever 's to blame for the refugees ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_w91vr4kdg ) , countries like sweden are at fault for helping to exacerbate the refugee crises ( i.e encouraging more people , including opportunist economic migrants , to take the perilous journeys across the mediterranean and rewarding people traffickers ) . 
  btw , you know what i think is selfish ? 
  not taking any responsibility for stopping dictators/occupiers , who have annexed other countries or committed countless crimes against humanity , to save your own skin . 
  maybe sweden 's overzealous `` humanitarian efforts '' has , like germany , more to do with what happened 70 years ago than what is happening today ? 
   i do n't see whats wrong with that ? 
  [ here 's one explanation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3bog4u1r_i&amp;list=llyv2nsulqlo-fiwn4hgf8-g&amp;index=2 ) it sounds counter intuitive but apparently having lower , simpler taxes means the rich pay more taxes in both relative and absolute terms . 
  if you drive the rich to take their money out of the economy ( moving abroad or using tax avoidance schemes/loopholes etc ) , it will depress government revenues and the rest of us will pick-up the bill . 
  that being said , if the tax rate is 0 % then they will pay zero tax , so i 'm sure there 's a `` goldilocks zone '' , where the government receives maximum revenue from the rich paying * the most taxes * in * the most numbers * - [ but i 'm afraid it does n't seem to be at 50 % or more ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/files/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-26-at-15.09.59-571x413.png ) and corbyn 's plans to reduce inequality by introducing higher taxes on the rich is just left-wing populism , [ which would make us * all * ( especially the poorest ) worse off .

  if the consequence of nuking japanese cities was that they would nuke yours , i do n't believe it would 've been in the united states 's interest to nuke japan ( and vice versa ) . 
  conversely , if britain had nukes during ww2 and the nazi 's had n't , i believe we would 've used them against the nazi 's and they would 've been defeated much sooner ( and saved many more lives ) . 
  perhaps they would n't have even considered annexing poland ( declaring war on britain ) in the first place . 
  besides , your position strikes me as cowardly and short-sighted . 
  what your effectively saying is `` lets not pose a threat and stand up for ourselves ( or stand up for others ) , to save our own skin . '', 
  if britain were like sweden , ireland , spain etc ; posing as a non-potent threat against an expansionist and fascist regime , yes we would not have been a strategic target and received the same treatment as we did , but we would probably also be having this conversation in german right now ... 
  if an all-out-war erupted with a nuclear superpower , we * could * have the same fate as non-nuclear armed japan had in ww2 , against a nuclear armed superpower ( i.e. 
  being forced to surrender though nuclear attack or nuclear blackmail - which trident can make unthinkable through mutually assured destruction ) . 
  considering trident takes decades to renew , can you confidently rule-out anything like that happening within that period of time ? 
  who could 've predicted * five years ago * russia 's annexation of a chunk of ukraine and the change in relations with the west ? 
  lets learn from history and not tempt fate . 
  if your issue is cost : the cost of the successor submarines is estimated at # 25 billion , over * 25 years * ( the missiles will have their lives extended until 2042 ) . 
  if spent evenly , it would represent 0.13 % of all government spending per annum . 
  for the ultimate insurance policy against nuclear attack or nuclear blackmail , i think it 's a no-brainer . 
   if you think denmark and norway `` did more to fight germany '' than sweden did sweden did more to help the nazi 's too ...  you obviously did n't study history at school . 
  maybe because sweden 's `` contribution '' to the nazi 's defeat was n't anything worth teaching/learning . 
   feeling smug , no , but what about not bitching when other nations take care of refugees from countries you have been instigating wars in ? 
  are you talking about * me * , the professor or the british generally ? 
  i 'm sorry , but the british are going to bitch when germany [ ( or sweden ) ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/11828019/britain-will-be-forced-to-take-fair-share-of-refugees-swedish-minister-warns.html ) impose their immigration policy on the rest of us ( we 're basically the same country now ) - especially when it rewards people traffickers and encourages more people to take the dangerous journeys from countries we * have n't * been instigating wars in ( e.g syria , nigeria , eritrea etc ) . 
  although i personally think we should be taking more refugees , britain has the right policy on this : taking real syrian refugees directly from the syrian/lebanese camps ( not opportunist economic migrants ) , [ while sending more aid to syrian refugees than any other european country ] ( http://imgur.com/a/mhfwi ) . 
  i guess that 's the difference between britain and germany . 
  britain uses its head * and * heart , while germany has gone from a country which just uses its head , to just uses its heart . 
  oh well , [ in a few decades britain will be calling the shots in europe . 
  ] ( http://www.cityam.com/221125/population-growth-uk-become-biggest-country-european-union-2050 ), 
  who was `` the hippy '' that gave poland to germany : the one who chose to do something but failed ( with their cities in ruins and hundreds of thousands dead ) , or the one who decided to do * nothing at all * because of their `` progressive '' neutrality ? 
  ( tbh , there are few things i find more irritating than cowards making a show of moral superiority/authority , especially when they use it as a cover for their cowardliness . 
  if you 're not willing to stand up for what you believe in ( or in sweden 's case : let others to stand up for what you believe in and then gloat when they screw up , to make yourselves feel better about your cowardliness ) , then your beliefs count for nothing . 
  if britain had the backbone of angelic sweden , this conversation would be in german . ), 
  actually , call me crazy , but i think it was germany 's fault for taking poland . 
  whether we chose to act or not , not everything is britain 's fault - `` britain 's to blame for ww2 . 
  britain 's to blame for the immigration crises : it 's britain 's fault for bombing libya . 
  it 's britain 's fault for ** not ** bombing syria . 
  it 's britain 's fault for propping up nasty dictators . 
  it 's britain 's fault for toppling them ... '' anyway , thanks for making a perfect example of `` doing nothing , while smugly second guessing the countries who dared stand for those who could not stand for themselves . '', 
  doing nothing and not taking any responsibility for a dictator , which has a precedent of annexing other countries and committing crimes against humanity , has consequences and can create more problems down the road too . 
  sorry to bring up the past ( or godwin 's law ) , but non-interventionism gave permission for another dictator ( hitler ) to annex weaker countries and commit countless atrocities against his own people . 
  interventionism defeated nazi ideology for good ( while saving ourselves from it ) . 
  sorry we tried to achieve the same outcome in iraq , but had less success . 
  i guess it 's easier to do nothing and feel smug second guessing the countries who dared stand for those who could not stand for themselves . 
  people from nazi occupied europe , north korean occupied south korea or iraqi occupied kuwait , never thanked the high-minded rhetoric from neutral hippy bystanders for their liberation , they thank the actions of those who stood up for them and intervened . 
  my personal opinion , but not all sovereignties are worth respecting ( or deserve equal respect ) . 
  in a dictatorship , who does the country 's sovereignty really belong to : the people , or the dictator ? 
  a dictator is an illegitimate occupier of a country , because it rules without the consent of its people ( which it can gain through democracy ) . 
  violating an occupiers sovereignty ( or a `` sovereign dictatorship '' ) and giving the country back to its people , so they can elect a government which has their consent , i think is a liberation - and a slightly different endeavour to * annexing * a chunk of a sovereign * democracy * ( a country whose sovereignty belongs to the people ) . 
  fuck the un , it 's full of illegitimate dictators/occupiers . 
  no , a distinction needs to be made between journalism ( i.e. 
  principles of accuracy , independence , impartiality , accountability and humanity ) , and open propaganda ( i.e acting as propagandists for one particular side ; distorting information , demonizing the enemy , deceptive handling of the facts , deliberate incitement to violence and intense hatred ) . 
  the quality of information is not equal . 
  no , it kind of is . 
  one news organisation serves as an outright government propaganda tool , which * never * questions/criticizes its governments actions ( domestic and abroad ) . 
  the other can exercise editorial freedom and is independent from government control , while it has [ an obligation to be balanced and impartial on subjects ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/page/guidelines-impartiality-principles/ ) , due to the [ charter and agreement ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/governance/regulatory_framework/charter_agreement.html ) - making it one of the most ( if not * the * most ) reliable news organisations on the globe . 
  it might have its * biases * due to the nature of people who work there , but which news organisation does n't ? 
  it 's still better than most of our `` independent '' news organisations owned by a few oligarchs , which do n't have the same obligations/commitments and appeal to their readers bias 's by their very nature ( to sell more papers ) . 
  the point is , while it is funded by the tax payer , the bbc is not comparable to state propaganda channels like rt or presstv . 
  if you think it 's propagandistic to offer independent and reliable journalism in countries where there is none , then fine ( i do n't think there 's a problem with that - a problem for tyrants maybe ) . 
  french military strategy : be liberated by the british . 
  itt : europeans which have been invaded and occupied within the last hundred years criticizing the british on their military strategy . 
  itt : europeans - whose countries have destroyed countless enemy assets , killed countless enemy troops , or even committed countless war crimes/atrocities against enemy countries - sermonizing the british on the ethics of not ` refunding an enemy 's warship they confiscated ' and bringing their national character into question . 
  on the other hand , we 're not exactly known for getting invaded and occupied , so ... 
  [ it looks like you need to take your own advice about `` whitewashing your country . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_the_ottoman_empire ) and no , i think i will take the moral highground , because we can , because we did ... 
  even though it was n't in our interest , even though slavery was accepted by almost every society across the globe , not only we did we * chose * to abolish slavery for ourselves ( we used 1/3 of our entire national budget to buy all the slaves so that they could be freed ) , but ( unprecedentedly ) we spent the next 60 years using our power and influence to suppress and abolish slavery everywhere else , including on the ottoman empire . 
  so , do n't take the moral high-ground over the british for slavery when , if it was n't for them , you would probably still be practicing it . 
  the ottomans only claim they have to the moral high-ground over the british is really `` our empire was smaller than yours '' - and thank heavens it was , because the world would be a far darker and more backward place if the ottoman empire and the british empire had traded places . 
  you mean some empires ( such as the ottomans ) may have treated their people more poorly than the british empire , but their empires were far smaller ? 
  how noble . 
  i do n't think any power has done more do abolish slavery around the world than the british empire . 
  not only had the british abolished slavery sooner than the ottomans , the main reason for the ottomans ( and much of the rest of the world ) curtailing their slavery , especially the atlantic slave trade , was due to british pressure . 
  it 's a good thing the british were the ones that achieved global hegemony and not the turks , eh ?
