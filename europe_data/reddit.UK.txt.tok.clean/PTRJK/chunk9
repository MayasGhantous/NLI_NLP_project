  underground where they can grow and fester unchallenged among friends and like minded individuals ... 
  remember , these people still have the vote : people might say the `` correct '' thing on the streets , but vote for the `` wrong '' thing in the ballot box . 
  depends which area you are in the uk . 
  i guess this will sound snobby but if you visit some economically deprived working class towns/areas , the women can look rather `` special '' and among the richer portion of society , women are generally way more attractive ( some are easily among the worlds most attractive ) . 
  bad make-up , diet , lifestyle etc , aside - i wonder if over the past several hundred years , the entrenched british class system has caused the male upper/middle class portion of society to absorb away the lower class 's attractive women , causing this disparity ? 
  edit : and generally the working class have more children than the upper class so ... 
  well like i said , we 're not a federation * yet * . 
  i get the feeling we 're waiting to get the last few jigsaw pieces of the european continent in our union , before we really press the accelerator towards federalism . 
  obviously it 's easier to hook countries into a single market of `` ever closer union '' ( that will take sovereignty law by law , until we 're a federation in all but name and then it 's simply a matter of declaring we 're a federation ) than getting sovereign nations -- whose politicians are reluctant to surrender large chunks of power and whose citizens do n't want to lose their national identity - to join a ( federal ) country . 
  countries can themselves chose whether they join the single market , but [ like in the case of the ukraine ] ( https://youtu.be/huq-n8gxvca?list=llyv2nsulqlo-fiwn4hgf8-g&amp;t=190 ) , the eu has shown that choosing a european future is n't always entirely an act of free-will - which has set a worrying precedent . 
  not only has the eu shown signs of an eu foreign policy ( without the democratic accountability ) , but are also prepared to make life very difficult for immediate neighbouring countries , which refuse to join the single market . 
  who knows how many more countries we will expand that policy to ? 
  i would n't have a problem with belarus joining ( if that 's what they wanted and met the criteria ) but i think it 's dangerous to wish it on their behalf - which is the impression i got from these comments , and the impression i think you might get if you saw russian making similar remarks . 
  but , then again the belarusian people hardly have a choice when they 're ruled by a dictator , who 's being bribed with cheap gas by russia ... ? 
  `` having belarus ( or ukraine ) eventually join the russian federation would be pretty nice , imo . '', 
  had this been said by a russian , i pretty sure this sub would immediately jump on him for having an expansionist/imperialist mindset . 
  just seems like a double standard . 
  am i wrong or is there a european exceptionalism for wanting to expand our borders - like `` the eu is not a country/federation '' ( yet ) , or `` our values are the right ones '' ? 
  i guess it has been said that there 's `` no right or wrong in geopolitics , just interests '' and in a war of influence between a ( pre ) federation of liberty , good governance and rule of law and one that does n't share those values ( at least not to the same extent ) , i know which one i would rather win . 
  it should n't be . 
  i think left wing support for russia has more to do with being very anti usa ( and by extension nato ) , than pro-russia/putin . 
  i hear a lot of anti americanism from the left - for its actions ( military interventionism ( `` expansionism/imperialism '' ) and support for israel ) and what it represents ( capitalism , individualism , economic inequality ) - so it 's a case of `` the enemy of my enemy is my friend . '', 
   we burned down canada 's capital after , i thought the burning of washington was in retaliation for the united states burning down york ( and the ` raid on port dover ' ) ? 
  tbh , i would like to see each nation done properly . 
  depends which types . 
  we mainly put milk in types of black tea , because i guess the higher brewing temperature and bold flavours need milk ( and sugar ) to balance it ... green teas ( with flavours like mint , orange or cranberry ) would clash and taste gross with milk . 
  i thought tea was brought to india by the british , to break the chinese monopoly ? 
  [ according to wiki , tea did n't become widely popular in india until the mid 20th century  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_tea_in_india ) `` tea was originally only consumed by anglicized indians , and it was not until the 1920s ( and in rural north india , the 1950s ) that tea grew widely popular in india through a successful advertising campaign by the tea board . '', 
  so , the consequence of these laws are that , while we continue to burn coal , we will have to reduce domestic production of coal and extract more of it from other parts of the world to compensate ( including russia we 're supposed to be sanctioning ) ; increasing the cost of coal , the trade deficit , unemployment and socio-economic deprivation ? 
  in other words , the planet will be more or less just as polluted , but we 'll be worse off and countries not affected by these laws benefit from it ? 
  oh well , at least our tree hugging conscience will be clear ( this should be the eu 's motto ) . 
  economically , this country is shackled to a corpse which committed suicide because it 's `` good for the environment '' , while the rest of the world steams ahead regardless . 
  you sound rather high-minded for someone who 's country was founded upon the suppression and extermination of its indigenous population ; a country whose current wealth and position owes a lot to the immoral and wicked enslavement and horrific abuse of people forcefully imported from foreign lands - a system not abolished until as recently as 1865 . 
  the whole world was a shitty place back then ( it 's a shitty place still and i 'm sure future generations will look back at us in shame ) , but not many parts of the world can hold the moral high ground over the british during that century , certainly not the americans ; had you remained a british colony , your natives would have been treated better and your slaves freed sooner . 
  and london is a qatari city . 
  :p just remember zaltps2 's comment was his personal opinion . 
  he 's not speaking on behalf of the entire country . 
  actually , that 's a little different ( understatement ) . 
  ` jaguar land rover ' is still considered a british multinational company ; its hq is based in the uk ( coventry ) , where the cars are also designed , developed and mainly manufactured - probably by a multinational workforce , but not that that matters much . 
  [ a briton is the chief design officer of apple ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonathan_ive ) , but i 'm pretty sure everyone considers apple products to be american . 
  maybe estonia should get some credit for skype etc ( from a personal standpoint ) , but you ca n't really compare it with jaguar land rover . 
  for anyone who would like to know the significance of the magna carta , it is one of the most important documents in history as it established the principle that everyone is subject to the law , even the king , and guarantees the rights of individuals , the right to justice and the right to a fair trial . 
  it is considered one of the first steps taken in england towards establishing parliamentary democracy , which was then adopted in many of [ britain 's former colonies and european neighbours .

  the cost savings would be negligible compared to the impact on our national security . 
  the estimated cost to renew trident is # 25 billion over * 25 years * . 
  if spent evenly , it would represent 0.13 % of all government spending annually . 
  for the ultimate deterrence against nuclear attack or nuclear blackmail , i think it 's worth it . 
  as we all know , the english speaking world is famous for its lack of intellectual creativity .

  ugh , we do n't deserve shows like topgear . 
  [ we deserve bland and boring programmes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euayeeawbye&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=360 ) like the one show . 
  that 's probably what topgear will become ; ` the one show ' , except about automotives and hosted by people like adrian charles , matt baker and chris evans . 
  maybe netflix will save me . 
  i think threatening to end one american hegemony , over losing another is what we call ` cutting off the nose to spite the face ' . 
  what would it mean for american influence if they left nato , which would force europe to build an independent military alliance and boost defence spending , which * could * rival or even exceed the united states ? 
  not only would europe no longer be dependant on american `` good will '' ( which they can attach strings to ) , but could potentially become a geopolitical rival , exerting an independent foreign policy . 
  you might welcome it , but i think your politicians in washington would prefer to keep europe as a relatively benign , docile baby , which is dependant on the united states for protection and guidance . 
  what a clever card the eu has played . 
  not only are the european leaders achieving their ambition of expanding the eu to the ukraine [ ( which nigel farage warned about in 2008 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weywwzrdotg&amp;list=llyv2nsulqlo-fiwn4hgf8-g&amp;index=2 ) , they 're using this inevitable confrontation with russia to polarize the rise of eu sceptic europeans , with the old , wartime false dichotomy of ` you 're either with us or against us ' , or in other words ; `` if you do n't support the eu and further eu integration , you 're a fucking twat , siding with the russians ! '', 
  better explained by george orwell in his 1942 essay `` pacifism and the war '' :  `` if you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other . 
  nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one . 
  in practice , ` he that is not with me is against me ' . 
  the idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle , while living on food which british sailors have to risk their lives to bring you , is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security . '', 
  so , talk about a win , win , win . 
  by [ increasing the eu 's size ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/25/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/ ) and provoking the bear , they 're [ increasing eu support ] ( https://euobserver.com/beyond-brussels/127793 ) ( by polarizing eu critics against a common enemy deemed a greater threat than any concerns to do with the eu ) and have a justification for [ increasing eu ( military ) integration . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/jean-claude-juncker-calls-for-eu-army-european-commission-miltary ), 
   this statement presumes that eu dragged ukrainians by their balls with it 's expansionist polices , when in fact ukrainians chose to go on pro-european path themselves . 
  [ is this analysis a misrepresentation of events ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huq-n8gxvca&amp;amp;list=llyv2nsulqlo-fiwn4hgf8-g#t=190 ) is the eu an entirely innocent bystander of the ukraine crises ? 
  edit : so downvotes and after 6 hours , not a single response ? 
  says it all . 
   it 's not like the uk have no influence within the eu we do , but he does n't . 
  he 's speaking for himself , not for the party as a whole . 
  china threatened to invade hong kong a number of times :  * [ in it [ declassified cache of colonial records ] , zhou says beijing would regard allowing hong kong 's people to govern themselves as a `` very unfriendly act , '' says cantlie . 
  not long thereafter , in 1960 , liao chengzhi , china 's director of `` overseas chinese affairs , '' told hong kong union representatives that china 's leaders would `` not hesitate to take positive action to have hong kong , kowloon and the new territories liberated '' if the brits allowed self-governance .

  thatcher later said that deng told her bluntly that china could easily take hong kong by force , stating that `` i could walk in and take the whole lot this afternoon '' , to which she replied that `` there is nothing i could do to stop you , but the eyes of the world would now know what china is like '' .
