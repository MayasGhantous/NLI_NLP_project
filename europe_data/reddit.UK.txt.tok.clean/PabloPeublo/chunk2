  how does that affect my statement that all reforms only have power going one way ? 
  as far as i 've seen , the official position of the conservative party , which currently comprises the government , is one of neutrality . 
  the lisbon treaty, 
  if you 're pro eu , this is not good news for you either . 
  it just means if remain wins , there are yet more reasons for people to not think the result is fair , and not accept the result . 
  every single `` reform '' has had power only going one way . 
  if you 're a cunt . 
  was calling her a `` snotty little cow '' necessary ? 
  makes sense . 
  i know i would n't go on holiday to greece when it 's constantly being trampled through by hordes of third world migrants . 
  especially after all the stories of crime about them . 
  if it 's so simple to make the worlds financial capital move , why has n't france made it move to paris ? 
  or germany made it move to berlin ? 
  interesting , so the eu gives us 57 % of our trade ? 
  would we not be trading with the eu if we left it ? 
  what utter bollocks, 
  probably the same way the english would feel if the scottish vote keeps us in the eu, 
  the eu better not start something it ca n't finish then, 
  if british citizens get kicked out of europe , european citizens would get kicked out of the u.k. 
  does n't seem like a great idea on you guys part . 
  murdoch wants us to stay in ... https://www.politicshome.com/foreign-and-defence/articles/story/murdoch-titles-will-back-eu-yes-campaign, 
  `` sensible economic logic '' from the same guys who told us we needed to join the euro fifteen years ago , or our economy would collapse ? 
  hmmm ... 
  so all this has happened despite being in the eu . 
  what 's your point ? 
  then why are they calling themselves the soldiers of odin lol, 
  do n't think cameron 's the one complaining about the lack of democracy to be fair . 
  was the norse religion even a big thing in finland ? 
  absolutely shameful . 
  be hard for salmond to sound like he 's not backtracking when he defends being in one union for the same reasons he 's against being in another . 
  even if it works , using this method will just make people resentful of the eu and demanding another referendum soon . 
  just like scotland . 
  `` stupid brits , let me explain what the best direction for your country is ! '', 
  yeah , i do n't think this is gon na help the in campaign ... 
  agreed , i 'm a eurosceptic but i had some hope cameron would achieve meaningful reform , in which case i could be persuaded to vote stay , but this is a joke . 
  im voting out . 
  epic meme, 
  why not ? 
  a majority is a majority . 
  you mean the majority of the population ? 
  you 're more of an idiot than you think brexiters are . 
  i regret that belgium was permitted to exist as a non-country, 
  yep , i 'm the one trolling , not the one defending nationality based insults, 
  you 're like the british equivalent of an uncle tom lmao, 
  so scotland would n't be able to become independent from the uk then ? 
  it is n't a colony after all, 
  great , another self hating brit prostrating himself for the approval of europhiles . 
  you can either condemn all such insults or none of them , not show how progressive you are by nervously laughing at people insulting your country while simulataneously shitting on hypothetical people insulting foreigners . 
  and ? 
  really makes me think, 
  a vote for independence, 
  get over what exactly ? 
  getting insulted ? 
  is the uk anti eu ? 
  then you ca n't regret it any more than i can `` regret '' the conservatives winning the general election despite me not voting for them , do n't be dumb . 
  really tiring to see british remainers prostrating themselves around here as if they 're begging for forgiveness for having the audacity to live in a country that does n't suck off the eu constantly, 
   i regret brexit did you even vote for it ? 
  which brits ? 
  remember guys , certainly no anti uk anti brexit circlejerk here . 
  that 's ridiculous , you do n't see us getting personally offended when they shit on our government and archaic systems, 
  yep , i 'm sure they 're down voting an article about british charity because they 're anti brexiters slagging off foreigners ... makes sense, 
  since when is the eu europe ? 
  is switzerland not european ? 
  / r/europe is anti britain, 
  you realize english people live in scotland right ? 
  which uk rhetoric upset you ? 
  the one from the free press or the one from the government ? 
  scottish voters are british , as much as it may upset europhiles who jerk off to the hope of the destruction of the uk . 
  well , your name is `` brexit hangover '' first of all, 
  not edgy , just annoying to watch people so up their own ass, 
   you guys, 
  you europhiles need to get the fuck over yourselves . 
  so the eu is now actively undermining the sovereignty of countries because they do n't want to be part of its club ? 
  feel free to find an example of this alleged hypocrisy from me, 
  hey , you try typing on an ipad in between news readings . 
  what the fuck is the european ideall other than the dilution of th nationstate ? 
  so am i tbqhf, 
  how is democratically choosing to leave a political union a stab in the back ? 
  of those who voted you mean, 
  only if you think a poll of hundreds is more accurate than a referendum of millions, 
  i generalised societal reactions , not black women . 
  think again, 
  evidently you can , as long as you 're a black woman, 
  in 1988 , abbott claimed at a black studies conference in philadelphia that `` the british invented racism . 
  '' [ 55 ] in 1996 , abbott was criticised after she claimed that at her local hospital `` blonde , blue-eyed finnish girls '' were unsuitable as nurses because they had `` never met a black person before '' . 
  [ 56 ] abbott 's apology came as marc wadsworth , executive member of the anti-racist alliance , who is half-finnish , pointed out that the the current miss finland , lola odusoga , is black , of nigerian and finnish descent . 
  `` she 's a black finn like me , '' he said . 
  abbott 's position was supported by fellow labour mp bernie grant : `` bringing someone here from finland who has never seen a black person before and expecting them to have to have some empathy with black people is nonsense . 
  scandinavian people do n't know black people -- they probably do n't know how to take their temperature '' . 
  [ 57 ] [ 58 ] on 4 january 2012 , abbott tweeted that : `` white people love playing ` divide and rule ' we should not play their game '' , which again led to widespread criticism including accusations of racism . 
  [ 59 ] only after being told by the labour party leadership that the comment was unacceptable did she apologise for `` any offence caused '' , claiming that she had not intended to `` make generalisations about white people '' . 
  [ 60 ] [ 61 ] the deputy prime minister nick clegg called her comments a `` stupid and crass generalisation '' . 
  nadhim zahawi , conservative mp , said : `` this is racism . 
  if this was a white member of parliament saying that all black people want to do bad things to us he would have resigned within the hour or been sacked . 
  '' [ 62 ] members of the public lodged complaints but the metropolitan police stated that no investigation would be launched and no charges would be brought against her , saying she `` did not commit a criminal offence . 
  '' [ 63 ] in january 2012 abbott suggested that taxi drivers discriminate on racial grounds , tweeting that she was `` dubious of black people claiming they 've never experienced racism . 
  ever tried hailing a taxi i always wonder ? 
  '' [ 64 ] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/diane_abbott#comments_on_race, 
  for remainiacs, 
  ah , so the full quote was `` i think people of this country have had enough of experts from organisations with acronyms saying they know what is best * and getting it consistently wrong * '' seems pretty different to what that guy said,
