oh i completely agree that there is already a problem with immigration in the uk where a subset of immigrants do not integrate well into british life . 
  this is an issue which definitely needs to be addressed with sensible policy . 
  but you ca n't begin to contemplate fixing this problem , if you have hundreds of thousands of immigrants coming to the country every year who have no qualification other than waving an eu passport at the border . 
   most of them are 3rd generation immigrants who were born and raised in belgium and ** are officially belgian citizens ** . 
  if i were n't already in favour of brexit , i probably would be now . 
  it 's quite an amazing thing that they 've managed to conduct such a thorough and impartial investigation on such a large scale in just a few days !, 
  i manage financial technology in fx ecommerce . 
  i 'm not quant , but more of a technologist who specialises in financial applications . 
  i suppose it 's been a while since i was involved with dick photo start ups in the us , and i never worked in sv at all , but $ 140-150k is about the highest i got to in my tech career in the us . 
  i am only familiar with london wages in the uk , which i concede must be well above the national average . 
  but i do n't know anyone in any segment of high tech in london on less than about # 80k , and plenty of people in my industry in the mid - # 150ks up to about # 200k . 
   no one sane will move from the us , wages are far higher i work in technology and moved from the us to the uk , where i earn more . 
  in certain subsets of the technology industry ( financial technology , for one ) , compensation tends to be better in the uk than in the us . 
  now , there 's the argument that the cost of living in the uk is much , much higher ... 
  i 'm finnished with these puns . 
  some people believe that membership in the european union is an extremely nuanced issue , with plenty of positives and negatives to both sides . 
  there are concerns with respect to the economy , immigration , culture , and sovereignty which all need to be carefully weighed when making this decision . 
  i fall into this category . 
  i am leaning leave , but i can see the benefits to remain . 
  then there are other people who were convinced that their side was right before the debate even started . 
  there are leavers and remainers among this group , of course . 
  sadly , it 's these people from whom we have heard the most during the debate . 
  they recite talking points like a diehard football fan singing his club 's songs . 
  now , perhaps as we are drawing nearer to the referendum with polls showing a very close race , some real fanatics are coming out of the woodwork . 
  these people , with all of the zealotry of a religious fundamentalist , are arguing that the other side are `` complete idiots '' , worthy of being punished for their heresy . 
  i 've seen some wild-eyed extremists like this on the leave side , and now i 've seen one on the remain side too . 
  except leaving the eu is not treasonous at all . 
  treason indicates an act of hostility against one 's nation or sovereign , and the european union is neither a nation nor sovereign . 
  in any event , that 's not my point . 
  surely you can see how supporters of the european union are unlikely to win over the hearts and minds of sceptics with threats of retaliation . 
   and i will definitely make it a point to do anything in my power to ruin everything for traitors like nations leaving the eu . 
   if you do n't want to give up sovereignty , you will have to pay . 
  give up sovereignty or you will pay ? 
  you should definitely be working in pr for the remain camp . 
  i ca n't think of a better way to win over undecided voters than with abject intimidation . 
  blame tony blair for that one . 
   even if they do n't leave entirely , they certainly wo n't be investing more in britain in the long run . 
  i do n't think that 's `` certain '' . 
  neither you , nor i , nor anyone knows what the long run looks like . 
   there will be very little reason to do so over the continent or ireland . 
  the uk is no more a part of the eu than france , or germany , or ireland is , and yet london has been the financial centre of choice in europe , dwarfing paris , frankfurt , and dublin . 
  it 's almost as though there are other reasons that the london financial sector thrives compared to other cities in the eu , reasons that will persist after the uk leaves the eu . 
   ** literally no company ** in city is talking about increasing their size or shares in city . 
  i work in the city for an american fintech company and we are growing our london office faster than we are growing our offices in the us or anywhere else . 
   in the medium term it will probably be the financial industry leaving for europe . 
  everyone outside the financial industry seems to believe this . 
  the reality is that it probably wo n't . 
  some segments of it may , but there are huge parts of finance that are unaffected by brexit . 
  more importantly , there is so much concentration of talent here in london that sheer momentum keeps it here . 
  new york , singapore , and hong kong are also outside of the eu and they do fine as well . 
  i ca n't believe it 's st. patrick 's day and i forgot to wear orange . 
   it is this kind of thinking that caused brexit and trump and the so called right-wing backlash . 
  when we make it unacceptable to have a discussion about topics like this huge wave of immigration from a different culture , we should n't be surprised that only unacceptable politicans will be willing to speak about them . 
  i found the wording of the bold text on the image ( `` the nearest places in a straight line from ireland '' ) to be ambiguous . 
  the nearest place in a straight line from the west coast of ireland is certainly * not * any country in the americas . 
  the tiny text in the lower right of the image makes it a bit clearer but i could n't read that on my phone . 
  `` the nearest places in each direction from ireland '' would have been clearer headline text , but alas . 
  this must be perspective perpendicular to the shoreline , as opposed to `` nearest place '' . 
  there is no way that anywhere on the west coast of ireland is closer to colombia than to england , but it may well be the case that if you are standing parallel to the shore at a certain place on the west coast , and you draw a line straight out in front of you , the first country that you reach is colombia . 
   you misunderstand the definition of borders in this context . 
  yes , i think you 're redefining `` borders '' to mean something different . 
  i 'm clear on the difference between a border itself and the rules which allow people to pass through those borders . 
   an american firm in seattle ca n't hire a canadian citizen living in winnipeg as easily as it can hire another american because of all the paperwork involved for both the company and the individual in question . 
  this is an issue that arises because of borders . 
  the us and canada do not have freedom of movement . 
  as i mentioned earlier , the us and canada ( and mexico , for that matter ) do have freedom of movement for skilled workers in certain classes . 
  it 's not exactly as easy for an american tech firm to hire a canadian software developer as it is for them to hire an american , but it 's * nearly * as easy . 
  i know this because , as a canadian myself , i 've been in exactly this situation : i showed up at the us border in niagara falls , presented my university degree and a letter from my us employer , applied for the tn visa on the spot ( which cost something like $ 50 , i ca n't recall exactly ) , and was on my way with minimal hassle . 
  but there are already borders between the uk and most of the rest of the eu , as the uk is n't part of schengen . 
  no one is talking about erecting borders that do n't already exist . 
  indeed , for everyone saying that free trade must mean complete freedom of movement , nafta is the shining counterexample . 
  if the eu 's freedom of movement were restricted such that only qualified , skilled workers were able to move between countries ( as in nafta ) , i am quite sure that brexit never would have happened . 
  unfortunately dogmatism prevailed and here we are . 
  in rome this weekend , and i have n't even seen a single polling station today . 
  where even do italians vote ? 
  sure , i 've traveled for work and lived all over , too . 
  i 've spent most of my life being an expat . 
  but i have also visited countries that i have never worked or lived in . 
  if you 're saying you 've never done that , then fine , i guess you 're not a tourist . 
  `` economic violence '' sounds like an entirely made up term to me , given that violence means to use force to injure someone . 
  rent is a mutually agreed price between tenant and landlord . 
  i do n't `` force '' rents up any more than my tenants force rents down . 
  the neighbourhood has changed , become much more upmarket , and that 's why rents have increased . 
   to them , people being priced out of their homes is a form of violence . 
  i 'm inclined to agree . 
  there are all kinds of reasons why prices in an area might increase . 
  indeed , as a landlord , i have raised the rent on my tenants multiple times . 
  are these all `` forms of violence '' ? 
   if you think tourism is travelling i frankly pity your view of travel . 
   i 've travelled loads . 
  if you have ever traveled anywhere for pleasure , that 's literally what tourism is . 
  the `` bourgeois property owners '' who often live in the city and participate in the economy themselves . 
  i 've run a rental property myself before , and of course , i was always hiring tradespeople for work in the property , and i hired locals to clean and maintain the property . 
  thinking that this money somehow disappears down the toilet and does n't have a positive impact on other people in the local economy shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how economics works . 
  aside from this , when tourists stay in cities , they eat , and drink , and spend money in shops . 
  i 've stayed in airbnbs in barcelona and in other european cities , and i surely will again . 
  in the end , i 'll have spent some money on my airbnb , but i 'll also spend even more money in restaurants , bars , and in shops . 
  locals work in those restaurants and bars and shops , and often times locals even own them . 
   all politicians are vehemently pro-tourism and , in general , they should be . 
  they inject a massive amount of money into an economy .
