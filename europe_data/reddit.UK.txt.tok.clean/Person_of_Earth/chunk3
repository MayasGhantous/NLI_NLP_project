  is it worth me trying to explain it to you ? 
  we won the ashes with a test match to go . 
  in australia 's first innings we bowled them all out for 60 before lunch and in the end we beat them by an entire innings . 
  i do n't understand why using the name `` macedonia '' to refer to the country that has [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/flag_of_macedonia.svg ) should offend greece . 
  let 's first assume that 's it name is `` the former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' , adjectives in a country 's name like that can be removed from the names of countries . 
  i do n't see what 's different about calling the country with [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/flag_of_macedonia.svg ) `` maccedonia '' compared with calling `` the hashemite kingdom of jordan '' `` jordan '' . 
  for the time being, 
  i went to google translate and asked it to translate what 's written below into japanese . 
   england   great britain   united kingdom   united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and it translated it as  \u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9   \u30a4\u30ae\u30ea\u30b9   \u30a4\u30ae\u30ea\u30b9   \u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8 \u30fb \u30d6\u30ea\u30c6\u30f3\u304a\u3088\u3073\u5317\u30a2\u30a4\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u9023\u5408\u738b\u56fd, 
  oh no russia , you do n't want to upset denmark or canada , they might send you a strongly worded letter of disapproval . 
  for the uk : ** west country ** in general : farmers , the phrase '' [ proper job ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glczvvcbbvs ) '' and inbreeding cornwall : pasties , surfing , does n't like devon and somehow not english devon : a posh version of cornwall , but it is n't cornwall , but is fine with being english ** south east england ** in general : very posh , rich and arrogant snobs new forest : horse shaggers brighton : full of gays portsmouth : boats ** london ** in general : hated by everyone else in the country east london : cockney rhyming slang , jellied eels and del boy west london : posh , rich and arrogant central london : where tourists visit and londoners moan about it * city of london : ~ ~ w ~ ~ bankers ** east anglia ** in general : very flat land , farmers , inbreeding , but nothing like the west country essex : nothing like the rest of east anglia , chavs , teenage pregnancies , ukip and fake tan ** the midlands ** in general : not a lot birmingham , wolverhampton , west bromwich : the word `` alright '' . 
  sheffield : steel lincolnshire : does n't like yorkshire ** northern england ** in general : [ looked down on by southerners ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qztynhwolz4 ) , pies and the word '' [ the ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6rhp8_pcfy ) '' noo-cas ` el ( newcastle ) : very demanding about newcastle united , unemployed people yorkshire : mad about cricket , the phrases `` oo-aye '' , `` hey , that 's good that '' and `` fancy '' and does n't like lincolnshire . 
  manchester : does n't like liverpool liverpool : the phrase '' [ calm down , calm down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypistkpaoe4 ) '' and does n't like manchester cumbria : kendal mint cake hull : a shit-hole ** wales ** in general : rain , sheep shaggers , has a silly language and does n't like england cardiff : does n't like swansea swansea : does n't like cardiff north wales : farmers , greater use of the welsh language , more sheep to shagg and plaid cymru ** scotland ** in general : deep fried mars bars , kilts with nothing underneath , bagpipes and does n't like england . 
  edinburgh : posh people , very different to the rest of scotland highlands and western isles : lives up to scotland 's stereotypes more and cow shaggers orkney and shetland isles : people who think they 're nordic ** northern ireland ** a mess * i personally find it quite ironic when i hear londoners complaining about tourists . 
  i do n't think any reasonable person would even batter an eye-lid if they saw protesters burning their country 's flag, 
  really ? 
  that seems like a pretty silly law to implement . 
  well , as long as they do n't attack the embassy itself , why would it be a problem for the police to deal with ? 
  it 's just a flag , no one 's going to get hurt because a piece of cloth is on fire . 
  i do n't see why anyone burning a flag would be newsworthy anyway . 
  why would the police stop you burning a flag ? 
  that 's it , i 'm moving to belgium . 
  that would n't have worked . 
   wow !, 
  montenegro is the only european country with a less than 50 % majority population ? 
  by definition , when the largest is less than 50 % , it 's no longer a majority , but the largest minority . 
  and therefore can not into nordic . 
  wait ... germany was n't 1st ? 
  the house of lords has no real power because any decision they make to block a bill or add amendments to it can be over ruled by the house of commons . 
  in effect , this reduces their power to delay bills for up to 1 year . 
  there are however 2 things i 'd like to change about the house of lords : 1 ) kick the church of england bishops out of the house of lords . 
  2 ) reduce the length of time they can delay bills for . 
  you have a better understanding of the english language than the americans . 
  big car factory ? 
  i do n't specifically make mock southern and eastern europe , i mock you all equally . 
  my opinion of hungary has gone up after seeing this map . 
  also , this map does n't specify if it includes the reserves or not . 
  this 'd be great for / r/shittymapporn, 
  meh , this argument is n't worth it , i do n't care . 
  this map is about languages , not dialects . 
  the map also includes cornish and manx , so it 's not like it 's giving occitan special treatment , i 'd rather see as many languages as possible on maps like these rather than just going `` no one speaks that , so it 's not included '' . 
  edit : corrected a typo, 
  estonia can into nordic . 
  irritating tourists from london and up north . 
  zoom in and you 'll see the blue part over estonia merges with the blue part over finland . 
  maybe estonia can into nordic after all . 
  i 'd like to see the data for herm and sark . 
  since there 's no data for albania , [ i 'll tell you it 's mercedes-benz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyh-351z_-0 ) . 
   the dog ulster which keeps biting itself . 
  ** sovereign ** state , and even that 's not the same as a country . 
  oh , [ that 's a easy one ] ( http://www.thefa.com/~/media/images/thefaportal/pillars/england/historical%20players/bobby-moore-wc66-aloft.ashx ) . 
  farage would probably still be working on the stock market if he had no eu to criticise . 
  so the result would still end up with a lot people hating him , we just would n't know who he was . 
  but enforcing direct rule over them is not the answer . 
  that would make it no better than the days of colonialism . 
  the fact it makes nigel farage die inside each time he looks down at his passport . 
   are you a lib dem ? 
  no , i do n't trust them ever since they voted in favour of all that tory policy in the last parliament . 
   in that vein , what if any changes would you make to the house of lords ? 
  well , the house of lords only really has power to delay . 
  it has no real power to amend or veto bill because any decision made by the house of lords can be over turned by the house of commons . 
  i think it 's good to have some people there checking stuff before it goes into law . 
  however , i would kick the church of england bishops out of the house of lords . 
   also , would you make any changes to drug laws , free speech laws ( e.g. 
  a constitutional right ) , education setup , or and/or our eu relationship ? 
  i 'm undecided on what the best thing to do about drugs is . 
  i think helping people fight drug addiction is a good idea , but i 'm not sure on the best way to do it . 
  as for education , i would n't change too much , schools to better when you do n't keep changing what they have to teach . 
  i 'm very much in favour of free speech . 
  we currently have it has a right by law , but not in a constitution ( because we do n't have a constitution ) . 
  yes , free speech should be a basic right in this constitution . 
  as for the eu , i can very easily make a list of various things wrong with it , that 's not hard . 
  however , these things are lot of small problems . 
  leaving would create 1 massive problem with the economy , so i think we 're better off inside the eu for now . 
  they 're not threatening to leave , only turks and caicos islands , but i would n't call that blackmail . 
  if they take actions to avoid being tax havens , then westminster tends to be willing to co-operate more with them . 
  however , it would be unfair for westminster to directly set the tax rates in the overseas territories because the people there do n't have representation at westminster . 
  well , if all look at all of them in turn : anguilla : i ca n't find anything on them wanting to leave , so we can assume they currently do n't . 
  bermuda : they had [ a referendum on independence in 1995 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bermudian_independence_referendum,_1995 ) and 74 % of them voted against independence . 
  british virgin islands : their most dominant party in recent years wants to stay as a british overseas territory . 
  cayman islands : i ca n't mind much information on them wanting independence . 
  falkland islands : unlikely to do independent , when they were asked if they want to stay as a british overseas territory in 2013 , 99.8 % of them voted to stay . 
  also , if they did become independent , argentina would probably invade very quickly . 
  gibraltar : unlikely , most people they do n't want to join spain as 2 referendums have prove . 
  independence is also unlikely because their constitution does n't allow independence without the agreement of spain which is silly . 
  montserrat : they still have n't recovered economically from the volcanic eruption in the 90 's , they ca n't afford independence . 
  pitcairn islands : 50 people live there . 
  saint helena , ascension and tristan da cunha : i ca n't find anything on them wanting independence . 
  turks and caicos islands : they 've been debating joining canada for a while now , maybe they 'll leave , but we 'll see . 
  fair enough . 
  you also beat them at drawing with san marino . 
  from the map , iceland would be better . 
  because cigarettes do n't light in finland as it 's too cold . 
  for the uk : 1 ) write a constitution , to stop thing just being done by convention , actually have the system laid out in law . 
  2 ) get rid of fptp and replace it with stv for all elections , national and local . 
  3 ) give the crown dependencies and the overseas territories that have a permanent civilian population representation at westminster . 
  4 ) create regional parliaments for england based of [ the regions of england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_england ) . 
  5 ) give the english regional parliaments , the scottish parliament , the welsh assembly , the northern irish assembly and the governments of the crown dependencies and overseas territories an equal amount of power . 
  each part would be able to set their own tax rates , however , each part would be required to raise an amount of tax based off of population and wealth . 
  westminster would be mainly used for the military , foreign policy and fiscal policy .
