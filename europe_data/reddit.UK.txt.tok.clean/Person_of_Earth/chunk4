  question to cypriots : how are the british military bases in akrotiri and dhekelia viewed in cyprus ? 
  are most people really that bothered about them or is there a significant support for wanting to get rid of the bases ?

  for some weird reason google translate puts things in upper case when you translate into armenian . 
  vatican city, 
  yes , malta was a british protectorate between 1800 and 1813 , then it became part of the british empire between 1813 and 1964 .

  thank-you for that , i 've changed it . 
  i refer you to my response to u/deadchucolacola, 
  to be honest , some of them probably do n't translate to `` applauds '' . 
  i used google translate since i do n't speak the vast majority of those languages , i ca n't guarantee they 're all the equivalent of the word `` applauds '' .

  it was spain that seeded gibraltar to britain in 1713 by international treaty , it was spain that prevented any movement across the gibraltar-spain boarder until the eu put a stop to that , and it was spain who signed the lisbon treaty , which defines gibraltar as british territory . 
  if you go independent , we 're keeping that rain . 
  gibraltar has expressed no desire to join spain . 
  they voted against spanish sovereignty in 1967 and against british-spanish joint sovereignty in 2002 .

   the biggest issue would probably be the precedent set by adding states from outside of europe into the european union .
