  this article was written in january . 
  if we can get all world nations with nuclear weapons to also get rid of their nuclear weapons at the same time , then yes . 
  if not , then no . 
  hahahahahahaha !, 
  good one . 
  [ how i imagined you saying that . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl69u60mwrk ), 
  someone from france talking about cricket . 
  you beat ireland , who are due to be granted test match status in 2018 , at the 2016 world twenty20 . 
  you also drew with oman , but that was because of rain delays . 
  your cricket team has been doing better than your football team recently . 
  i will not buy this record , it is scratched . 
  in welsh , you can just press some random buttons on the keyboard and that 'll mean something . 
  well , you already have [ a national cricket team ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_national_cricket_team ) . 
  see , this is why new zealand is having a referendum on hanging its flag . 
  people should stop confusing new zealand with austria . 
  what the fuck is that ? 
  source ? 
  the term `` great britain '' does n't include northern ireland though . 
  great britain is the name of the uk 's mainland . 
  the official name of the uk is the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  lost shuttlecock . 
  so what 's portugal ? 
  wanting a referendum on leaving is not the same thing as wanting to leave . 
   sue me ... americans probably will . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar_sovereignty_referendum,_1967 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar_sovereignty_referendum,_2002, 
  the 3rd and 4th videos are the same link . 
  because spain would veto gibraltar joining the schengen area unless the uk joins with it . 
  both are true . 
  i did n't know the netherlands was located on the moon . 
  google proves you right . 
   then we can look forward to northern ireland declaring it wants to back out of the uk you 're forgetting that northern ireland 's first minister is campaigning to leave the eu . 
  ~ ~ the tories dropped the `` and unionists '' from the name of their party when they ended their alliance with the uup . ~ ~ i stand corrected . 
  [ stadium mk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stadium_mk ) is the ugliest in terms of the decision making process behind building it . 
  then why do you have the union flag as your flair instead of the st george 's cross ? 
  whereas gibraltar would be left out because spain would threaten to veto the whole thing unless gibraltar was excluded . 
   in his ft interview , mr macron also stressed that france would roll out a `` red carpet '' to london 's bankers if the uk voted to leave the eu . 
  france , can you take them even if we do n't leave ? 
  they lobby the government and do n't pay their taxes . 
  it would be nice to get rid of them .

  never before has that been said by an irishman . 
   and because of that treaty gibraltar has no claims over territorial waters beyond its port . 
  if you think the treaty is correct and gibraltar is british clay for so , then gibraltar has no territorial waters . 
  if you think gibraltar should have territorial waters , then this treaty is no longer valid . 
  you ca n't cherrypick the international legislation , discard the parts you do n't like and act like we did n't notice . 
  [ unclos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_convention_on_the_law_of_the_sea ) overrides the treaty of utrecht in areas where they contradict . 
  the areas where they do not contradict remain in force . 
   i stand by what i said seeing your point on the tax heaven issue is `` omg , spanish journalism , so populist because it 's spanish rabble rabble rabble '' . 
  it still does n't change the fact that you were unable to find the exact wording of the original quote . 
   [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_utrecht ) is still working in the case of gibraltar . 
  and because of that treaty , spain has no valid claims over gibraltar . 
   gibraltar is a colony and it 's part of the decolonization committee by the un , and it is included in the resolution 66 of the unitated nations of non-self-governing territories . 
  firstly , non-self governing territory = / = colony . 
  secondly , the only reason gibraltar is on that list is because it does n't have representation in the british house of commons . 
  the sovereignty dispute with spain has no bearing on gibraltar 's status as a `` non-self-governing territory '' . 
  greenland and the faroe islands were removed from that list when they were given representation in the danish parliament . 
   no , it 's not , and here 's fucking fabian picardo ( such a british name right ? ), 
  chief minister of gibraltar , talking about exactly this :   bad relations between spain and gibraltar prevent the british colony from sharing tax information and other financial data with madrid as it does with other european nations , chief minister fabian picardo said in an interview published on monday in el pa\u00cds . 
  firstly , i do n't see the relevance of his name . 
  he was elected by the people of gibraltar . 
  wheatear his name has british or spanish origins is irrelevant . 
  secondly , that is n't a direct quote . 
  it 's been paraphrased by the journalist who wrote that article . 
  go and find the exact wording of the original quote if you want to use it as evidence . 
   before you reply again , please do inform yourself first . 
  i reject talking to someone that simply has n't been informed in the matter that we are discussing . 
  but please , above all : stop inventing shit in order to try to convince yourself that what you believe is true . 
  it is not . 
  learn the facts , then we can discuss . 
  thank you very much . 
  i think you 're the one who needs to learn the facts . 
  if you apply the un convention on the law of the sea , then it 's very easy to determine the maritime boarder between spain and gibraltar . 
  if a given piece of water to closer to spain than gibraltar , then it is in spanish territorial wasters , and therefore spain has the fishing rights . 
  if a given piece of water is closer to gibraltar than it is to spain , then it is in gibraltarian territorial waters . 
  if a given piece of water if more than 12 nautical miles from spain or gibraltar ( or less than 12 nautical miles away but closer to another country ) , then it belongs to neither spain nor gibraltar . 
   so either gibraltar is not a colony and therefore not british sorry , but you appear to be picking nonsensical logic out of thin air . 
  how does weather gibraltar is british or not have any sort of impact of wheatear gibraltar is a colony or not ? 
  gibraltar is british and it 's not a colony . 
   a tax-heaven level fiscal system that 's a myth spread by populist journalists and politicians in spain who seems to go on the nonsensical logic that gibraltar is a tax haven just because other british overseas territories like the cayman islands are tax havens . 
  if spain did n't demand that gibraltar was excluded from the common fisheries policy , then there would n't be an argument over fishing rights . 
  sorry , but what does that have to do with gibraltar and the eu referendum ? 
  they 'll outnumber the number of points they score . 
  this was actually done to protect the pig from david cameron . 
  i typed `` define migrant '' into google and got :  a person who moves from one place to another in order to find work or better living conditions . 
  i typed `` define refugee '' into google and got :  a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster . 
  i thought people in jersey did n't get a vote ? 
  how 's it shameful that i hate the pope ? 
  this is weird , i agree with the pope . 
  however , i still have no respect for the pope or his catholic church . 
  [ also , here 's tim minchin 's pope song . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be5hkpwwjem ), 
  that would make me more likely to stay . 
  i hate having to convert into units i do n't use or care about just so old people can understand me . 
   our nearest neighbour france someone needs to show this journalist a map . 
  somehow , this idiot thinks that the thickness of the uk-ireland is greater than the distance across the straight of dover . 
  man city because money .
