  this is the stupidest piece of legislation i 've ever heard of . 
  the argument about privacy and the powers of the security services is a minor thing as far as i 'm concerned , but this is as stupid as banning people from locking their back doors encase the police want to search your house . 
  any hacker will be able to access e-mails , and the software wo n't distinguish between the security services and a cyber criminal . 
  if this passes then i 'm going to stop using my . uk e-mail address . 
  malta , it 's obviously malta . 
  and i 'd like an option for it should be given more powers in some areas but have power taken away in others . 
  the [ falkland islands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v3twakyfzs ) has a good one . 
  so have i and i do n't even speak spanish . 
  he 's right , france coveres a lot of time zones . 
  he talks about both if you watch the entire video .

  i 'm just going to leave [ this link ] ( https://youtu.be/nh6s_uqjhzk?t=2m20s ) here . 
  i 'm english , it 's a natural instinct . 
  `` and for those of you who are watching in black and white , the pink is next to the green . '', 
  without the u , colour ( i.e. 
  when written as color ) looks like it should be pounced co-lor . 
  blame the invention of the printing press . 
  it caused the letters ; \u00e6 , \u00f0 , \u00fe and \u01bf to be removed from english and the letters k , q and z to be introduced because the only printing presses available were made in mainland europe . 
  this is a click-bate headline . 
  he wants the role of the turkish president to more ceremonial , which is similar to how it works in ireland and germany where they have an elected head of state who 's job is largely ceremonial , but also an elected head of government , who has a lot more power than the head of state . 
  what he 's saying is actually quite sensible . 
   we 've been practically sucking russian dick i thought you dutch people liked sucking dick . 
  i dispute that . 
  eastern sweden ? 
  north-western russia ? 
  so norfolk and suffolk when sea levels rise . 
  but the name of the language is n't british . 
  the name of the language is english , so only the english flag makes sense . 
  nationality = / = language . 
  english ( traditional ) is still wrong . 
  it should be the st george 's cross , not the union flag . 
  and in some countries , political parties are 100 % funded by the tax payer . 
  google might have to move their european operations out of ireland . 
  mohamed cartoons is the only thing i can think of . 
  shhh , do n't tell them . 
  do n't worry , he 'll come back and apologise in a minute . 
  i disagree . 
  not if you fall into or out of the plane of the flag .

  for the first time ever in something that is n't commonwealth games cycling . 
  i did not divide it up myself . 
  i have solved a problem that has nothing to do with me , now go and find some else , preferably someone as annoying as you , who 's willing to give up their house in return for northern cyprus . 
  i came up with part of the solution to cyprus 's 3 way division , you could at least be more grateful . 
  here 's a deal , cyprus can have akrotiri and dhekelia in a swap deal for your home . 
  then we 'll put a boarder blockade in place to stop you from leaving your home and we 'll cut off your water , electricity and internet . 
  genoa is good at picking it 's flag . 
  i like the flag in the top right hand corner of the shield . 
  the normans did n't conquer the isle of man though . 
  [ the isle of man ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/flag_of_the_isle_of_mann.svg ) because why not have 3 legs stuck together as your flag ? 
  that would n't be very helpful to the northern ireland peace process , making that island even more divided is not a good plan . 
   is there even a way for france or the rest of those in eu to expel britain ?

   i 'm honestly yet to meet someone who actually likes the people running their su well , i do n't know who runs my student 's union , but they seem to spend a lot of their funds on the student pub , so i 'm not complaining .

  that should explain why .

   vatican city is ... ... more than italy that 's not saying much . 
  the falklands do n't share a land boarder with argentina though , unlike gibraltar and spain . 
  in fact , gibraltar is our only overseas territory that is n't an island or a group of islands . 
  do finland and russia no longer exist ? 
   least favourite neighbour : france my opinion of switzerland has gone up . 
  using alcohol to fend off a scotsman , are you mad ? 
  then your democracy is functioning perfectly . 
  you w0t mate ? 
  huh ? 
  what was that ? 
  hmmm , it was probably nothing . 
  you could say that we boarder spain . 
  but gibraltar is an overseas territory , and despite being british land , it 's not part of the uk . 
   favorite : the english channel i prefer the solent because we do n't split that half way with france .

  ok portugal , here 's a test to see how good your democracy is , all you need to do is answer this one question : how many of the parties running are full of arse-holes ? 
  i know , but i was n't sure if taoiseach or prime minister would have been better for the title . 
  on the one hand , with taoiseach , people might not know what that is , but if i were to have gone with prime minister , someone might have come along and been all `` fecking english !, 
  he 's the taoiseach , not prime minister !, 
  stop fecking anglosing ireland ! '', 
  or words to that effect . 
  by that logic , it should be written as `` 4 # 50 '' . 
  what the fuck did i just watch ? 
   nevertheless , i think that we need , even if small , an eu army to control the outer borders of schengen . 
  i do n't understand why a free border zone does n't have a cooperative control you do n't need to send the military to police boarders . 
  that 's a job for police , not the military . 
   people will ignore the french completely that seems to be a pretty strong argument as to why the united sates of europe would be an overwhelming success . 
  uefa consider as monaco to be a french team . 
  i 've tried goggling it , but i ca n't find anything on it . 
  could you explain this concept of warm rain to me please ? 
  i 'm very familiar with rain , but it 's the warm part that 's confusing me . 
  it 's ok , but the yellow and red stripes do n't look very nice . 
  i like georgia 's flag . 
  do a barrel roll . 
  and i demand reparations for ronaldo ~ ~ wanking ~ ~ winking . 
  same thing . 
  norway . 
  he must be swiss if he 's that efficient and still likes offending germans and austrians .
