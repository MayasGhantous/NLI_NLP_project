i think you 're forgetting something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glzf4luyyrs&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  the channel islands are only part of the british isles in an administrative sense . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what these people want . 
  if the military base closed down and the 1,500 chagossians were ` returned ' to the islands then i do n't expect that the british government would want to fund their development , having already incurred the price of closing down the base and other related costs , and as a british citizen i would n't want them to either - they can have independence and all the responsibilities of independence . 
  why should we do favours to people causing such a hubbub ? 
  most of the original islanders are already dead and these people have limited justification for their upset . 
  the territory was acquired legally from the mauritius after all . 
  truthfully , if given passage then within a year all the islanders would have starved to death , and somehow that would be the uk 's fault also . 
  the phrase was only avoided in those agreements to appease the irish and get the agreement through . 
  it 's used singularly other times in britain and indeed the rest of the world bar ireland , where the rejection of the term is based solely on emotional nonsense rather than geographical norms . 
  if scotland became independent from the uk and the uk continued as the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ( which would still be a valid name as the united states of america do not encompass all of america and the republic of korea does not encompass all of the korean peninsular ) then scotland could not claim to be separate of the geographical term that is ` great britain ' , anymore than mexico today could claim not to be in the geographical mass known as ` america ' . 
  the islands are named the british isles in the same way the irish sea is named so . 
  the contents of the irish sea do n't belong to the state often called ` ireland ' , and the contents of the british isles do n't belong to the state often called ` britain ' . 
  north america does not belong to the country often called ` america ' , and the south china sea does n't belong to the country often called ` china ' ( no matter how many islands they build ) . 
  sensationalist headline again from the independent . 
  the proposed ` ban ' is on unskilled immigration , with special allowances made for those in the medical sector and for temporary farm workers . 
  i fully endorse the proposals personally . 
  5 years will be plenty of time to enable us to catch up in respect to making school places , building enough houses , the nhs and so on , and if 5 years is n't enough , extend it as necessary or impose a limit of 30,000 to 100,000 on unskilled migration or whatever number the country requires . 
  this is sensible policy and it puts british people first in their own country . 
  the welfare state ca n't exist alongside unlimited migration , and one country needs to accept this and make the move to limit immigration first and set an example so that the eventual universal-basic-income concept can be implemented across europe without leading to mass migration of peoples from poorer countries to the richer ones . 
  whichever party has this in their manifesto will see a large swing of votes . 
  i only hope the conservatives own the policy as their own instead of leaving it to ukip for them to taint . 
  i think you only need one if you are watching live tv on the screen , so if you are just using the tv as a pc display you wo n't need one and can fill out a disclaimer form stating you are n't receiving broadcasts on it . 
  if you do n't fill this out inspectors can arrive at your house and ask to be let in to investigate themselves , and sometimes even when you fill out the form you can be visited . 
  it 's sort of a grey area whether you have to let them in your house or not , as they do n't have police with them . 
  if you use the tv as a pc screen though and then use any bbc service that shows live broadcasts , like a live event shown online on the bbc or using ` catch-up tv ' then they also ask for a license , but there were reports recently that their detection abilities are quite weak here . 
  the license costs around # 150 a year for a colour television , and around # 50 for a black and white tv ( still popular in parts of the countryside ) . 
  i 'm not sure how flexible payments are but i 've not heard of any cases where people have been arrested for not paying or anything too serious . 
  there 's a real debate over the tv license at the moment though , because as all tvs connected to an aerial or satellite receive the bbc channels , you ca n't watch tv and be unable to access the bbc , therefore even if you never watch the bbc you still have to pay for it . 
  still , at least on those channels there are no advertisements . 
  oh that 's nothing , some of them from the past were truly horrific .

  really over the top with creepy music and melodramatic language . 
  they make it seem like an evil , intolerant , radical ideology has infiltrated western society ( no not islam ) . 
  [ the bbc are experts at installing fear in the population .

  do n't agree with removing protection for wildlife but [ the uk has already reduced carbon emissions to levels 42 % lower than those in 1990 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/uk-greenhouse-gases-fall-climate-change-a7658981.html ) . 
  the uk is now only the 19th largest emitter of co2 , while australia and canada both emit more than the uk despite having around half the uk 's population . 
  the uk is only the world 's 25th largest emitter of co2 per capita . 
  it 's not like the uk is the naughty child regarding climate change , and this sensationalist headline wo n't make that true . 
  refugees and migrants frequently abuse european citizens . 
  good news for the european union as a whole . 
  dump the fanatics . 
  haha no they 're all legitimate nicknames that have been given to each skyscraper by the public . 
  to be fair they do resemble them , and they 're better names than their boring official ones like 22 bishopsgate and 52-54 lime street .

  obviously they 've all got their unique nicknames , the scalpel , the trelis , the can of ham among others , which will now join the cheesegrater and gherking , forming some sort of bizarre glass and steel picnic . 
  the two tallest ones in the centre are apparently going to be around the same height as the shard on the other side of the river , and from [ some angles it seems that the gherkin will slip away from view entirely .

  that 's not very nice is it ? 
  it is almost 4am but that does n't give you an excuse to be so cranky !, 
  you need a time out , and that 's a lucky coincidence because it 's clearly past your bedtime as well . 
  better than that atrocious flag you 've wrapped yourself up in . 
  basically toilet paper . 
  it 's a steaming pile of shit . 
  you can even see how they cast every villainous person as white in the video . 
  that is true racism . 
  love and compassion wo n't stop lorries and bullets i 'm afraid . 
  interesting !, 
  it somehow manages to look both fragile and sturdy at the same time . 
  beautiful against that sky too . 
  the irish free state was a dominion of the british empire , that 's historical fact . 
  it only ceased being a dominion after 1937 and ratified a new constitution . 
  any statement other than that is a perversion of irish history , which i quite clearly know more about than yourself . 
  oh god it really is awful is n't it . 
  how do enough people see that and still think it 's okay and not just a load of crap . 
  this does work but only on non-muslims . 
  what 's frozen food got to do with it ? 
  parliamentary democracy , yep . 
  you can purposely conflate the two if you want . 
  no , what i refer to are the aspects now found in all developed societies , whether they be police services , post offices , freedom of the press , democracy and such . 
  it can more accurately be attributed to the ` big bang ' in the city of london and the boost of north sea oil . 
  i 've got more than enough to share ! , [ you probably kinda need it right now , let 's face it  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi0dffrsmpi ), 
  there 's a difference between being open to foreign cultures and letting them rule your own . 
  the english language for example has absorbed an incredible amount of words from not only other european languages but from those in the indian subcontinent also among other places , becoming a truly global language . 
  the same goes for the british taste for the benign aspects of foriegn cultures , such as food , music and clothing . 
  facilitating the spread of a bland , artificial pan-eu identity is n't the same . 
  there 's nothing there , nothing to use . 
  even the flag - yellow stars ? 
  what 's that all about , it 's entirely meaningless . 
  britain has been the most tolerant european country in accepting afro-caribbean culture , sikhs , east asians and so on , because there are real tangible benefits and opportunities for integration into a country where british values reign supreme . 
  the same ca n't be said for islam in britain or anywhere in europe , where it seeks to dominate , to change laws , to affect public belief and so on . 
  not at all angry , and i only state the facts . 
  anything from the modern sciences to industrial development to the global economic model to the end of slavery and child labour all have their roots in the british culture and society . 
  i 'm shaped by the people , country and culture that has consistently produced these advancements and achievements . 
  yes i have my personal achievements important in my life , but that does n't mean i will be absorbed entirely by those and not defend and extol the values and culture that led to both them and the types of ones linked in that video . 
  chinese culture is inwards , obedient and uncreative , following the values of confucianism , which is why chinese society and civilisation has always stagnated at the same comparatively mediocre level before falling back into anarchy . 
  culture in the middle east also closely follows a rigid system , islam , and their golden age ended almost 1000 years ago , and the region has n't been a center of innovation since then . 
  i think i 'm perfectly justified in wanting british values , culture and society to remain paramount . 
  [ except the achievements of my country and people continue today ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxsz6iv0dlm ), 
  looks young too ... this new generation of european-born muslims are more radical than their parents . 
  sometimes i think about countries like romania and wonder what it must be like to have to consider your nation only notable for some mostly forgotten event that occurred 600 years ago , rather than coming from the country that is the progenitor and proliferator of modern civilisation . 
  the world is so utterly shaped by british contributions , that for people in every country it is like a fish being unaware of the water in which it swims . 
  universal culture is british culture . 
  referencing the british empire still ? 
  who 's really stuck in the past , sweetheart ? 
  regardless , in what way exactly did the irish cast the first stone ? 
  ireland was n't even fully independent until 1948 , and only self-governing in 1922 .
