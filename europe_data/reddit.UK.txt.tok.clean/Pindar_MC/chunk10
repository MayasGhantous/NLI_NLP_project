  ignore that the french economy contracted in q2 2016 . 
  forget that the irish economy contracted by 2.6 % in the first quarter of this year . 
  pay no attention to [ all economic predictions from the last decade which show the uk economy becoming the largest in europe by the 2030s ] ( https://data.oecd.org/chart/4pp9 ) . 
  let 's just indulge ourselves in hysterics instead . 
  ignoring the outcome of the referendum would spark turmoil and not be in the best interests of anyone in the uk . 
  many people had already felt disenfranchised before the vote , and such a development could have led to anything . 
  what if scotland voted for independence and the uk government refused to grant it because it deemed that scotland remaining in the uk was in the best interest of the scottish people ? 
  it would be chaos . 
  i do n't like to think that british people would violently take to the streets and riot but who knows what would happen . 
  well i do n't think she personally had a strong view on the european issue before . 
  i get the impression that she disliked the way the eu occasionally affected her role as home secretary but on that the whole thought it 'd be easier and definitely more likely that the uk would remain in . 
  it was likely in part a career move supporting eu membership . 
  how incredibly self-centred and ironic seeings as israel would disappear into the sand within weeks if america stopped supplying it with missiles and foreign aid . 
  it 's well known that she did n't * want * brexit , why is that noteworthy ? 
  may is pursing with it because that 's what 's expected in a democracy . 
  she became pm to lead the country according to the wishes of its people as represented via the outcomes of democratic processes like referenda and elections , not according to her own views . 
  this is n't south america . 
   are you seriously implying that the uk is the ** only ** thing saving us from a russian apocalypse ? 
  not at all , but as a nuclear power the uk 's continued commitment to eastern european countries such as [ estonia ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39311670 ) and [ poland ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/22/uk-to-permanently-station-1000-military-personnel-in-poland-from-2017 ) sends a clear message to russia that the western alliance is intact and ready to defend europe 's borders . 
  [ the uk is signing a defence pact with germany ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/20/britain-germany-set-sign-new-defence-co-operation-pact/ ) even after brexit , which will be to germany 's benefit seeings as it does n't have major military capabilities . 
  if the uk disengaged from such cooperation and even symbolically removed troops from eastern europe , it would definitely embolden russia . 
   perhaps you might be able to negotiate some kind of appeasement ? 
  appeasement is better than outright collaboration , is n't it ? 
  i 'm obviously not american . 
  regardless , the american presence in europe * has * greatly contributed to peace in europe . 
  i do n't really see how you can argue otherwise . 
  if i was trying to espouse or perpetuate the idea of american exceptionalism , then i 'd have attributed european peace to * only * american intervention . 
  poundbury is an example for europe to follow in creating modern housing that actually represents national architecture and culture , which has been under attack for over 60 years . 
  modern cities and towns all across the developed world have become indistinguishable , whether it be in japan , germany or canada . 
  there 's no reason why that with modern technology we ca n't make buildings as beautiful as those from 100 years ago or longer . 
  [ this stunning building ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/the_mappin_and_webb_building%2c_london_%28as_was%29_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1229496.jpg ) right in the centre of the city of london survived the blitz , only to be torn down by ` modernists ' to be replaced with [ this atrocity ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/1_poultry.jpg ) . 
  visit mansion house street in the city of london on google street view and rotate around . 
  if it were not for that building , this area would serve as an unblemished example of some of the best british architecture . 
  not all architecture is equal . 
  [ there 's been a concerted effort to destroy high european architecture over the past few decades ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/defyusyxkaahwhi.jpg ) , and along with it national senses of community , culture and identity . 
  that 's why the canadian prime minister says things like `` there is no mainstream canadian culture '' . 
  because it was destroyed , just like it is being in europe . 
  it 's much harder to erase 1000s of years of history of course , but at this rate it wo n't take long at all . 
  unfortunately it 's not up to me . 
  if it was , we 'd be leaving the eu as soon as possible with a trade deal pushed through under the threat of the uk withdrawing all defence and security cooperation with the eu . 
  see what the russians make of that . 
  [ you got that right . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc8quqayyjc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=12s ), 
  and labour have committed to carrying out brexit . 
  if everyone who wanted to remain in the european union had voted liberal democrat then we 'd have a liberal democrat government or at least a very strong lib dem partner in coalition with labour and there 'd be a second referendum with the chance of remaining in the eu at the end . 
  every single person who voted for labour has permitted brexit to continue by doing so . 
  80 % of votes in the general election were for brexit-supporting parties . 
  brexit is happening no matter what . 
  the uk government has long said no deal is better than a bad deal . 
  they wo n't accept a bad deal . 
  do you believe them now ? 
  i want to know what you mean by ` brexit bots ' . 
  really ? 
  i can see that two minutes before that comment you posted one in response to another user reading :  oh i see , you are a mancunian brexiter , nothing to see here so is it brexit bots or brexit voters you 're talking to in this thread ? 
  can you make your mind up please . 
  may the silent majority prevail everywhere . 
  no such thing as a brexit nationalist , i 'm not sure what message you 're trying to convey . 
  what i said and what i stand by is that ` british people ' are a group of closely related ethnicities and that areas of london which are 63 % foreign-born and just 17 % white british in the census are not as equally british as a town in yorkshire . 
  to argue that such places are equally british is pure madness . 
  you might be able to live with such bizarre definitions but do n't try to impose them on me . 
  no you just cry about strangers like me instead . 
  i 'm confident enough about the state of my country to talk about the areas in which it succeeds and the area in-which it does occasionally fail . 
  my original comment if that 's what you 're talking about is a 100 ton truth-bomb . 
  try not to get burned !, 
  your bizarre eu-nationalism is quaint and entertaining . 
  i eagily await how your comments will further mutate . 
  pretty poor . 
  normally the guardian cartoons at least mix in other topical events . 
  michael gove 's knife is at least a year old and the ambulance irrelevant and inserted quite hastily . 
  this could reference any brexit-related event really since last year . 
  there has n't been any event in the news to justify the message behind the cartoon either ( seriously , just that david did n't have papers on the desk ? ) . 
  should have saved it for next month . 
  the ` respected and organised mr barnier ' is wearing a bit thin and i 'll even use the word ` cringey ' for this particular cartoon . 
  the eu is the bloc that 'll be losing influence and importance when its second largest economy and arguably most powerful military leaves . 
  the uk will still have its large economy and military , nuclear weapons , global alliances and seat at the un security council . 
  in rankings released reported on today , the uk is second place in terms of global soft power . 
  the eu as an entity has negligible influence . 
  it does n't matter what its gdp or military is , it 's weak and impotent and always we be . 
  it must really sting being an eu nationalist because you have nothing to celebrate , nothing that actually belongs to the eu except one failure after another . 
  just exposing bs when i see it actually . 
  i 'm aware that the situations have great differences . 
  it 's a sarcastic comment to highlight the flaw in the other poster 's comment . 
  i 'm sure that those who supported irish independence never regretted their decision , but i 'm also quite sure that those who voted for brexit ( including me ) are happy with that decision and do not want to stop brexit , and do not continue on merely to avoid admitting to ` making a mistake ' . 
   everyone wants brexit to stop but the brits are to arrogant to admit mistakes or to get off high horses it reminds me of how really every single irish person actually wants to rejoin the uk but is too arrogant to admit that they made a mistake , that they miss the queen and that they want to come back . 
  how is the eu/eec any more responsible than other variables such as the british and american troops in germany , or that france is a nuclear power , or that both countries are members of the united nations ? 
  maybe the fact that france and germany do n't have overseas colonies to fight over ? 
  or as i say , phenomena outside of the european project , such as globalisation . 
  germany could n't invade and lay waste to paris without killing thousands of citizens from foreign countries and bringing the wrath of the global community down upon it . 
  the eu is a byproduct of the peace in europe secured by other means as mentioned in my previous post . 
  it is not the * cause * of european peace . 
  what a joke . 
  some of the most ridiculous ones from this propaganda piece :  1 the eu has been keeping the peace for 70 years no it has n't . 
  the usa , nato , the cold war , mutually assured destruction and globalisation has kept the peace . 
  to claim that the eu has done so is a complete revision of history . 
  it sure did n't keep the peace in the balkans . 
  ------  2 we are europe : we have europe day , a europe flag , and the ode to joy . 
  lol ... and ? 
  how is this a ` reason ' to have the eu ? 
  any organisation can have a celebratory day , flag and anthem . 
  how does any of these things validate the eu and this * style * of eu ?
