  so what 's the problem ? 
  you believing it * has * political significance is irrelevant to its significance . 
  your emotions are not a legitimate argument . 
  maybe the european union should change its name ? 
  confused people might think that norway , switzerland and 1/3rd of russia are also part of the union . 
  the usa has to change its name too , because after all not all of america is part of the united states of america . 
  the united arab emirates does not consist of every arab emirate , as it does n't also include qatar or kuwait , so someone better send them a memo too . 
  the term is still used by the british government , it 's only omitted in dialogue with the republic of ireland . 
  i 'll keep using the term because it 's the only globally accepted and recognised term . 
  i do n't owe it to anyone to * not * use the term . 
  it 's not offensive , it 's not hate speech . 
  it does n't need a trigger warning . 
  but we 're not discussing the impacts that each example of imperialism has had on the world , we 're discussing the validity of the term ` british isles ' , which you reject because of connotations with imperialism . 
  * everything * related to the nation state is connected to imperialism , even the term ireland itself or the name of the location in your flair , leinster , a leftover from the old irish kingdom of leinster . 
  how is ` leinster ' as a phrase any more acceptable than ` british isles ' ? 
  the irish province of leinster covers a geographical area that at one time in history belonged to another kingdom or tribe with a different name . 
  if the term ` british isles ' must be abandoned , so must every term for every location everywhere . 
  did you read the above comment ? 
   just britain & ireland works best  it 's quite easy to have britain & ireland  and then just say mainland britain & ireland no one is trolling . 
  no one owns an island , and even if ` irish people ' do ( define irish people ) we can only legally mean citizens of the irish republic . 
  the republic of ireland does n't extend to northern ireland or the entire mass of ireland , thus they do not own the island of ireland . 
   the irish people do and the vast majority of irish people reject the term , as does the irish government . 
  * if * people own landmasses , then irish people ( only legally existing as irish citizens ) only own the landmass of the * republic * of ireland . 
  maybe when they have dominion over the entire island they 'll have a shot at getting the name changed . 
  still doubt it though . 
   define valid ? 
  there is no strong contemporary impact due to the influence of warring gaelic tribes . 
  there is , however , a monumental contemporary impact due the policies of the british empire . 
  that 's not how imperialism is defined . 
  it 's still imperialism regardless of its impact today . 
  definition :  a policy of extending a country 's power and influence through colonization , use of military force , or other means . 
  exactly how the old irish tribes and kingdoms would have expanded . 
  you ca n't change geography . 
  if ireland is n't part of the british isles then northern ireland is n't part of ireland . 
  it 's using the same rules . 
  how does linking to a graphic created by irish nationalists prove anything ? 
  no one ` owns ' an island and regardless , northern ireland is an integral part of the united kingdom . 
  the republic of ireland does not entirely encompass the island of ireland , thus it has no unique right to decide its name . 
  everything is rooted in imperialism . 
  even the disunited , warring tribes of ireland practiced imperialism upon each other . 
  imperialism is n't more valid or less valid just because it occurred in a particular time period . 
  ireland was even colonised by the celts , they were n't put there by god , so get off your high horse . 
  the british isles is the only globally recognised term , and that will never change just because some people in ireland want it to be called something else . 
  you have your own language ( probably ca n't speak it mind ) , feel free to call it what you want in irish . 
  you do n't get to decide what it 's called in english though . 
  all a conspiracy is it ? 
  no , great britain has * only * ever been a geographical term . 
  great always meant size , it 's only in recent decades that great has come to mean ` good ' or ` powerful ' . 
  great britain is n't even the country 's official name , it 's a * geographical * term that refers only to the island but today people sometimes incorrectly use it to refer to the entire uk . 
  [ you clearly need to watch this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnu8xdbsn10 ) and [ read this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_britain#derivation_of_.22great.22 ), 
  it 's a geographical term , great britain as opposed to brittany or ` lesser britain ' . 
  and who are you to decide when the uk ` stopped being great ' ? 
  the uk is still a ` great power ' as a p5 recognised nuclear power with un security council permanent membership and one of the strongest militaries and economies in the world . 
  outside of that the uk is a ` cultural superpower ' doing incredibly in film and [ music for example . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36332019 ), 
  that does n't flow well at all with ireland said first , and it would always be ` great britain ' because that is the island 's geographical name . 
  your desire to leave out the ` great ' shows that your motivation is spite . 
  your feelings do not get to change geographical certainties . 
  if ireland is n't part of the british isles because ireland is n't part of the uk then how can the uk be part of the ` european isles ' if it 's not part of the eu . 
  your answer - you ca n't leave a geographical continent ? 
  well you ca n't leave a geographical island grouping either . 
  british isles is a entirely geographical term . 
  that the uk is referred to as ` britain ' and the people of the uk referred to as ` british ' colloquially is a phenomena that occurred many many years after the islands were called the british isles . 
  the british isles does not mean that those islands belong to the united kingdom of great britain and ireland . 
  the irish sea does not mean the isle of man within the irish sea belongs to ireland . 
  if scotland left the uk and the uk was renamed to the ` united kingdom of southern britain and northern ireland ' then the term ` great britain ' to refer to the geographical island on which scotland sits would still be valid . 
  it would not imply continued ` british ' rule over scotland . 
  your argument has no basis and is entirely rooted in wishy washy feelings . 
  feelings do not decide geography unfortunately for you . 
   britain & ireland * great * britain and ireland at the minimum . 
  we ca n't just throw away naming conventions and geographical terms for no reason . 
  who did they have to ` justify ' to lol ? 
  the country ` the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ' was named after the british isles , not the other way around . 
  i think you should be grateful for such a potassium-enriched gift , regardless of your skin colour . 
   but you do n't care , because you do n't understand what 's going on and this is a game of football to you , so you 're simply cheering for your side . 
   there are no arguements for brexit . 
   you 're just having a pop at the irish as you have done several times in this very post . 
  ( lol where ?? ), 
  your comment barely makes any sense . 
  you reckon that 2 % in favour of brexit is n't good enough , so i asked you whether it would be in the case of a vote for irish unification . 
  somehow you 've bizarrely taken that to be a ` pop ' at ireland . 
  i 'm not going to delicately dance around your fragile ego and victim-complex so it 's just better if we do n't engage at all . 
   just do it one more time . 
  ooh scary . 
  not interested in your victim-complex tbh .

  the problem is their reasoning for changing them , not who the new busts/portraits are of .
