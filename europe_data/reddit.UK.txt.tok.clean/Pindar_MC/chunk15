   we did n't lie and illegally go to war with another country on false pretenses and brought alot of this terrorism to the eu shores while killing millions of innocent men women and children every single us serviceman who fought in the middle east went through shannon airport . 
  ireland is just as complicit as countries which sent troops . 
   the uk has spent it 's career in the eu being anti eu and it 's legacy over the last ten years is that of an obstructionist warmonger and now competitor ireland 's political class oppose deep eu integration also . 
  the uk and ireland worked as allies in europe to prevent such integration . 
  without the uk , ireland will practically be alone in trying to block uniform corporation tax rates and an eu army . 
   but must say what does your comment actually mean ? 
  did you read it ? 
  i 've ` called you out ' and revealed the flaws in your comment . 
   i just see your comment as a pathetic attempt to justify unjustifiable actions well do read it again because if you 're talking about the uk potentially not paying the eu bill , i never referenced that . 
  what does your comment * actually * boil down to ? 
   `` i do n't like boris johnson . 
  the uk is america 's ` fuck doll ' . 
  mention donald trump for bonus points . 
  the uk is going to be like greece . '', 
  it 's an ignorant comment based on stereotypes and fueled by personal prejudice . 
  if the uk for example is ` america 's fuck doll ' what does that make ireland ? 
  the uk greatly benefits from the uk-us special relationship , seeing unparalleled nuclear and security cooperation for example . 
  what does ireland get for letting the us military use shannon airport ? 
  what does ireland get for being complicit in every death caused by the us army in iraq and afghanistan ? 
  what does ireland gain for having its supposed neutrality trampled all over ? 
  if the uk is a ` fuck doll ' , what does that make other countries in europe and the west that are not the world 's 5th largest economy or a major military power and who are actually fully dependent on the usa for their own protection ? 
  -------- i see another comment of yours later down in this thread that goes :  or are you guys just good at putting zingers on busses with fuck all facts or intelligence to back them up where are the ` facts ' or ` intelligence ' that justifies this part :  gg uk say hello to greece on your way down, 
  wealth is irrelevant here . 
  those two nations have withdrawn their applications to join the eu . 
  their people do not want to join the eu either . 
  why is that not considered ` uneducated ' but brexit considered so ? 
  forget 2100 , [ i 've seen it reported that the uk population will already be approaching 80 million by 2050 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/03/uk-population-largest-europe-2050-driven-immigration-ageing/ ) , which is obviously disconcerting . 
  it 'll be interesting to see how brexit affects future uk population growth if immigration controls * are * tightened . 
  immigration already appears to be dropping , with net immigration being 248,000 in 2016 compared to a record high of 336,000 the previous year . 
  newspaper cartoons use stereotypes and mocking . 
  shock ? 
  this is n't the 1950s . 
  newspaper cartoons do n't influence public perceptions . 
  why not rather go on about the way [ the simpsons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmy0ilnuaoe&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3s ) or [ family guy ] ( https://youtu.be/_ljbpvmykgo?t=40s ) represents irish people ? 
  they 're far more influential . 
  or is it only bad if british people do it ? 
  this is the 21st century . 
  tabloids do not hold great sway over the population . 
  people seem to find any bizarre excuse to lay the blame at something other than the failures of the eu itself . 
  the eu is n't entirely at fault , of course . 
  if the right-wing tabloids in the uk are so utterly dominant then the general election would have came out differently , seeing overwhelming backing for a very pro-brexit conservative party . 
  what 's behind the increased euroscepticism in other nations ? 
  what 's the reason norway and switzerland have withdrawn their applications to join the eu ? 
  is the media in those countries apparently-dominated by rupert murdoch as well ? 
   carpet bombed millions of british with insane amount of lies re eu and left it with the image of institution of unelected beurocrats which stole british sovereignity and stands in the way of its majesty greatness . 
  this is an outsider 's analysis . 
  think about it for a moment , it 's essentially a stereotype . 
  the same story , the same mediocre analysis repeated again and again . 
  no one in the uk thinks the eu is holding the country back from our previous , empire era greatness . 
  it 's crazy talk . 
  i think the reality is that concerns over immigration have led to the brexit result . 
  there are almost 3 million eu citizens in the uk , most of whom arrived in the last 15 years . 
  the net immigration rate has tripled since the 1990s . 
  people have valid concerns . 
  you do n't need to read the newspaper to be concerned , you just need to try and make a doctor 's appointment . 
  do n't worry , [ it continues on today . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxsz6iv0dlm ), 
   i wont mind going one step further and say that the majority of british people are idiots ( uneducated or otherwise ) one step further up the stairs of racism . 
  [ british people built the world . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9bdvhcunps ), 
  what lies are you referencing ? 
  do you really think that after a 2-year long national discussion , 17,410,742 people voted to leave the eu just because of the writing on a single red bus which suggested spending extra money on the nhs ? 
  really ? 
  do you have written testimonies from all leave voters . 
  both sides made exaggerated claims . 
  i do n't contest for a moment that [ this video from a leave campaign for example is misleading ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9la0wgbgwia ) , but the remain side was also awful . 
  how many people voted to remain in the european union because they feared a [ ` punishment budget ' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36534192 ) of austerity , a [ recession ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum ) , or even [ world war 3 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/08/cameron-brexit-will-increase-risk-of-europe-descending-into-war/ ) ? 
   he 's incredibly good at convincing uneducated people why is it just so hard to accept that the majority of the british people wanted to leave the european union , and not because they were ` uneducated ' and ` tricked ' . 
  it 's clearly much easier for those that like the eu to pretend that the everything 's fine and that those who voted to leave are stupid , racist or were tricked , rather then realise that the eu actually has many great flaws . 
  just continuing ignoring the problems until the whole thing collapses . 
  it was just a joke , what a stupid response you 've given , and in your other comment linking to such events and promoting division . 
  you link to an article where a portuguese woman was spat at in britain , and i can link to an article where [ a british woman was disfigured in an acid attack in portugal . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-39864999 ) does either attack represent either nation ? 
  ridiculous . 
  [ just say the word , portugal !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_alliance ) [ i 'm sure britain will go all the way to protect portugal too !, 
  :-) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhexhqzjkpc ), 
  a lot of so-called ` british humour ' is like that , the punchlines vary in predictability and quality . 
  here are some shorter examples : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thnpmhbl-8i https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49ximfzjpss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbfaohrum6m&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=19s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdwd3xf2g_i, 
  it 's easy to joke about such sentiment and dismiss it entirely but there is actual truth to the claim that ` they took our jobs ' . 
  [ eu migrants make up 11 % of manufacturing workforce ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39576112 )  eu migrants make up more than one in 10 manufacturing sector workers in the uk , official figures have shown . 
   in a report , the ons said that last year an estimated 3.4 million workers , amounting to 11 % of the entire uk labour market , were foreign nationals . 
   this number was made up of about 2.2 million eu nationals ( 7 % ) and 1.2 million non-eu nationals ( 4 % ) . 
   one in seven workers ( 14 % ) in the wholesale and retail trade , hotels and restaurants sector was an international migrant , with 64 % of these , more than half a million people , coming from the eu ------ manufacturing , retail and hospitality are ` working class ' sectors . 
  it is the working class who disproportionately suffers from eastern european immigration in this sense . 
  ee migrants are hard-working as that article mentions , but that is n't adequate solace for those poorer brits who now ca n't find work . 
  labeling them as ` stupid ' or ` intolerant ' just is n't right . 
  it 's been going on with ` rednecks ' in the usa for much longer than in europe . 
  lots of people in the uk take issue with heavy immigration but their reasons differ depending on their class and location in the uk . 
  some for example * are * concerned with eu immigrants who are not working instead : [ eu migrants without a job make up city the size of bristol ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/12/eu-migrants-without-job-make-city-size-bristol/ )  eu migrants of working age living in the uk who do not have a job account for a city the size of bristol , new figures have revealed . 
   one in seven of the 2,733,000 eu migrants aged 16-64 - a total of 390,000 - are unemployed or `` inactive '' . 
   a survey by the office for national statistics does not give a breakdown of how many claim benefits , but those who are unemployed will be eligible for jobseeker 's allowance and may also claim housing benefit and child benefit . 
  people who are `` inactive '' include those claiming disability benefits . 
  --------- during the brexit debate in the uk we could have had a real discussion over the positives and negatives of immigration , but unfortunately all attempts to discuss the topic are poisoned by the extreme right but also by seemingly ` normal ' left-wingers who try to clamp down on all discussion of the topic , often in one way or another branding people with concerns over the issue as bigoted , stupid , racist , xenophobic , nationalist , fascist or worse . 
  i 'm not accusing you of doing this , but those south park scenes aim to quell the immigration debate . 
  even during the brexit debate , references to a ` schrodinger 's migrant ' for example ( which were woefully incorrect as migrants are a group made of many independent individuals , not one uniform bloc ) were entirely designed to make those concerned with immigration look stupid and diminish their voices . 
  it 's a seemingly-harmless but very dirty tactic . 
  i 'm surprised by croatia 's colour . 
  but we 're talking about in one country , in britain . 
  it should be the british people who decide who gets to live in the uk , not people in other countries .
