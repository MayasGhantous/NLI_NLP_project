   trudeau : first and foremost , what we have very much in common -- as ** happy as we are to be positively engaged on the world stage ** -- is that our ** focus is on our own citizens and making sure that we are supporting them ** and that we are ** creating solutions ** . 
  we 're seeing a lot frustration , fear and anger . 
  there will always be people who say , we should just tear things down , they simply do n't work and we should just fold inward . 
  ** the three of us -- angela , emmanuel and i -- are trying to show that we can work with existing systems ** and that ** we need to make sure that they work for all citizens and that they create the freedoms and the opportunities without having to be more fearful ** , which the right is always pushing , or angrier , which the left seems to push . 
  what an absolute mess of meaningless waffle . 
  `` we just have to find solutions and make sure people like those solutions so that the solutions function as solutions ... because that really would be a solution . 
  by the way , do you like my vegan socks and the way i reassuringly pat macron on the back ? '', 
  [ he also thought that the world will end in 2060 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isaac_newton%27s_occult_studies#newton.27s_prophecy ) , but everyone drops the ball sometimes . 
   you are so ready to blame the left when the right cause this . 
  yeah , that 's right . 
  blame everyone except the perpetrators . 
  the rioters are responsible for their actions . 
  nothing has happened to justify this violence . 
  they were n't * forced * to burn down cars and shops that belong to innocent people , who might have even been sympathetic to their views . 
  it seems people 's livelihoods are dispensable for hard-leftists who want to engineer extreme political change . 
  will it be people 's lives next ? 
  yeah . 
  and ? 
  except the people rioting in this case are middle class lefties taking a day off of work or university to go smash up public and private property , which will need to be repaired with either private money from local family businesses already struggling against large corporations or with tax money that would otherwise be spent on public services . 
  it will be the actual ` peasants ' of modern society like street cleaners who will have to deal with the mess . 
  in victorian london , there was cholera , the disenfranchised , slums , workhouses , little shoeless children selling matches on the streets in order to make enough money to eat scraps , many of whom died in the winters . 
  there was * real * reason to riot in those days . 
  rioters today have nothing in common with civil rights protesters of the past or with people coming together to demand suffrage . 
  what exactly are you trying to say ? 
  it 's not a normal reaction for people to burn down their own city because leaders of the 20 richest/most powerful countries are meeting in that city to discuss the problems of the world . 
  [ the ` elites ' are not the ones rioting , are they ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7srjonstjv0 ) if hamburg is kindling then the g20 meeting is n't the match . 
  the matches are the opportunistic leaders and organisers of this protest ( riot ) and the somewhat international protesters who 've decided to travel to hamburg with the sole intention of causing destruction . 
  leftists burn down their own city in order to garner international media attention and promote their worthless careers , then they look at the damage and blame others ? 
  this is n't a legitimate protest by people * really * suffering from the drawbacks of capitalism . 
  it 's just rioting by spoiled brats who 'll use any excuse to destroy things , egged on by leftist ideologues peddling a culture of victim-hood and hatred against the individuals , society , culture and ideologies that have made our western countries rich , safe , free and prosperous . 
  q1 is normally weak but q2 is usually strong . 
  if there is much weaker growth this quarter then it would be ` proof ' that there 's been a considerable slowdown compared to last year . 
  yes there are ` fears ' , fears that the economy see growth in the second quarter of 0.3 % instead of the more traditional 0.6 % . 
  the headline ( which many wo n't read beyond ) is more severe than is required . 
  i recall from the economic crisis that this sort of language is normally used to reference an expected recession . 
   friday 's figures painted `` a rather bleak picture for the uk economy and underline the challenges lying ahead , '' said kay daniel neufeld , senior economist at the centre for economics and business research consultancy . 
   based on the latest data , the national institute of economic and social research estimated the economy grew 0.3 % in the second quarter , barely faster than the 0.2 % expansion in the first quarter and well below the long-run trend of 0.6 % . 
   but ruth gregory at the consultancy capital economics said she was expecting growth to accelerate to 0.4 % in the second quarter . 
  it 's not amazingly fast growth , but still acceptable . 
  are we all forgetting that [ the french economy actually contracted in the second quarter of last year ? 
  oh i expect downvotes with nearly every post i make on this sub now , even when i 'm specifically trying not to annoy people and when i word my posts carefully . 
  it 's a shame i ca n't read german or i 'd try and find the book or some excerpts online . 
  it 's interesting that you say she just lost control . 
  i do n't think she 's an evil woman but you expect someone as experienced in politics as her to do better . 
  how others around the world can see her crash like that and still proclaim her leader of the free world just blows my mind . 
  some of the best british films have been made in collaboration with the usa , with whom the uk does not have freedom of movement . 
  i expect most people who work in such ` industries ' will have the personal capabilities to travel between the uk and the eu without much difficulty at all . 
  i do n't really think it 's an important enough issue considering some recent british films . 
  this article from the self-proclaimed guardian is about as hard-hitting as another brexit-related headline of theirs - [ will a hard brexit spell disaster for london 's cosmopolitan art scene ? 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/jan/17/hard-brexit-london-art-world ) please , no . 
  anything but london 's cosmopolitan art scene !, 
   surprisingly enough , countries do not want to be turned into refugee camps and we had to , be ready for it , compromise . 
  but `` many of the refugees '' ? 
  do you even know how many refugees turkey has taken in comparison to the whole of europe ? 
  it really should n't matter what turkey wants . 
  it should n't matter how many people turkey has already taken . 
  europe should protect its borders from the refugees coming from north africa and the turkish coast by any means necessary . 
  it 's then up to turkey to protect its borders with syria and elsewhere if turkish people have issues with the refugees in turkey . 
  if turkey decides to send all its refugees back to the syrian border it really would not concern me , because what i care about is the future of european countries and european people . 
   do you seriously think the 2015 wave stopped because hungary built a fence ? 
  is that it ? 
  if the eu had stronger borders which did n't allow thousands of people to waltz through then the number of refugees entering europe would not have increased in the first place . 
  i 'm not talking about chainlink fence , i mean real borders with checkpoints , walls and guns . 
  there might then be thousands of ` refugees ' clamouring at the borders of europe , but that honestly would n't concern me . 
  i 'm sure they 'd leave when winter came around , and many would have never left their homes in the first place with false hope of making it here after others had successfully made it here . 
   `` stay in turkey and you might have a chance , come here and have none . '', 
  i want the message to be `` do not come to europe by alternative means because you will not be accepted . 
  you will be imprisoned on an offshore base and ultimately be deported if the prospect arises . 
  if you stay in un camps or legitimate camps already existing in the middle east with documentation you * may * one day be accepted by select european countries that choose to have you . '', 
   you ca n't even be bothered to bring something new to the table besides this `` pie in the sky '' turkey deal ( with all the bad stuff removed ) crap . 
  what 's the point of a united europe if it ca n't even get a good deal from turkey of all countries ? 
   even australia has to take people from niue , do n't you know ? 
  they can delay application , and make their lives misery but if they pass the asylum criteria they will have to be taken . 
  how many hundreds of thousands have they taken ? 
  i think i prefer the australian method . 
  no , the concepts are not comparable , and it 's incredibly misleading to claim they are . 
  in a situation like i describe the numbers of refugees coming into europe would decrease because we would n't be accepting one ` real ' refugee for every ` fake ' refugee that is given to turkey . 
  i 'm not sure why you avoided that point . 
   so turkey is not acting as an offshore detention center ? 
   it does not have camps built do hold refugees away from us for a price ? 
  they are not detention centres which prevent those people coming to europe . 
  many of the refugees in those camps ultimately will enter europe via the ` refugee swap ' deal . 
   the return deal was not made to send the message that trying to come to europe will lead to nothing ? 
  no , this is n't the message at all because the number of refugees entering europe is n't decreasing . 
  for every ` wrong ' refugee turkey accepts they give us one ` right ' refugee . 
  that does n't send any sort of message strong enough to reduce the pull factor of europe for refugees . 
  europe accepts one refugee from turkey for every one refugee turkey accepts from europe . 
  all europe gains is the potential that the new refugee * might * actually be syrian and * might * not commit terror or other crime . 
  it 's just wrong to pretend such measures are taking place in any meaningful sense . 
  tens of thousands of refugees have been admitted into europe this year alone , and only several hundred have been returned in such deals . 
  europe should n't be accepting any unannounced foreign arrivals , or at least enforce limits . 
  when the death toll rises and the people making the journey actually realise that they will die before getting to europe , then they will stop trying to make the journey . 
  over 80,000 refugees have come to europe this year so far , and around 2,000 have died making that journey . 
  it sounds callous , but too many are making that journey safely because they are being collected by europeans , essentially at the libyan coast , and unless that changes and these refugees realise the journey is mortally dangerous , they will keep coming unabated . 
  ... you must be confused , that or you just did n't read my comment and read something you made up instead . 
  what i 've described and the situation with turkey is not even remotely similar . 
  i do n't know how you 've misunderstood so badly , so i ca n't comment any further . 
  well that 's an unexpected winner for me . 
  whenever i pass the albert bridge i 'm struck by how ugly it is .
