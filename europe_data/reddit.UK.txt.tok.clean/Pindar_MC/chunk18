  it might not be a brutalist travesty , but it absolutely does not suit london ... or anywhere . 
  it looks so tacky and grimy in the daytime , sort of like disneyland . 
  offshore detention centres with no prospect of entry into europe . 
  potentially build them in a somewhat-friendly country like tunisia , paying a reasonable but not extortionate fee . 
  once the migrant/refugee community becomes aware that they will never step foot in europe they will stop coming . 
  if the boats do n't stop , simply tow them back to the lawless libyan coast where they came from and leave them there . 
   who struck a deal with erdogan ? 
  are you referring to the refugee deal with erdogan ? 
  that 's not something to be proud of . 
  the deal is incredibly poor . 
  the eu pays turkey a ridiculous price to swap ` illegal ' refugees who arrive at islands in greece for ` real ' refugees from camps in turkey . 
  the rate of refugees coming into europe is n't decreased , it 's just that one type of refugee is exchanged for another , which for many is still unimpressive , as they consider almost all of these refugees to be economic migrants in the first place , camps or no camps . 
  * citizens * around the world may trust merkel more , but that 's not exactly notable . 
  ignoring countries like china and russia which set their own agendas , most g20 countries are firmly in the orbit of the usa , whether that be the uk , canada , mexico , japan , south korea , australia and so on . 
  the fleeting tenure of donald trump as president will hardly change that . 
  of the remaining countries , i do n't see how indonesia for example can be considered to be following germany rather than the usa , seeings as there is practically no significant dialogue between the two nations . 
  no country is following the footsteps of merkel economically , geopolitically or socially , in terms of refugees for example . 
  the usa leads by default because of its overwhelming economic , cultural and military might . 
  i do n't understand why this is pitted as donald trump vs merkel . 
  with donald trump 's poor reputation ( deserved or otherwise ) i 'm sure any major world leader would be considered more trustworthy and just , even theresa may . 
  on a wider scale , there is no meaningful dichotomy between the usa and germany . 
  germany more or less follows in line as an ally of the usa like the rest of the west . 
  there are no competing german and american spheres of influence , germany as an individual nation state has no major independent geopolitical role . 
  in many ways its role is the economic glue that maintains the current unity of the eu . 
  if that 's germany 's global role or its remit of leadership , then i do n't think merkel has done incredibly well at all . 
  all notions of european solidarity were severely damaged when she unilaterally invited refugees into germany without regard for the countries that these refugees would pass through on their journey to germany . 
  unquestionably , this has brought the idea of sovereignty back and closer to the forefront of discussion , particularly in some eastern european nations , all while rebuilding borders and walls across europe . 
  perhaps most ill-judged was merkel 's decision to facilitate this crisis during the brexit referendum debate . 
  the streams of questionable refugees pouring through europe , country after country after country with some even coagulating in sight of the white cliffs of dover themselves was enough to persuade many brits that the eu could n't be relied on to protect its borders and ultimately the borders and security of the uk . 
  immigration was already a major concern in britain , and this tipped many people over the edge . 
  the uk 's withdrawal from the european union will be a significant blow to the eu 's international influence and prestige . 
  quite simply , merkel has indirectly helped the eurosceptic movement in britain and has led to an increase in populism and euroscepticism in other parts of europe , which coupled with continued economic malaise in some parts of europe and a continuing migrant crisis could do more to destabilise the union over the next few years . 
  while the threat to the eu is currently receding , her actions alone threatened the continued future existence of the eu last year . 
  if the eu had unraveled in such a hasty manner there would have been real international geopolitical repercussions . 
  ultimately her reputation has been saved thus far because of decisions made by the electorates in other countries , france , the netherlands , austria and so on , not by her own skill or strategy . 
  no , calm down . 
  i never said that scotland does n't have values , i said that it does n't have particular values of ` inclusion ' and ` progression ' anymore than another part of the western world , and that such terms are meaninglessly used to refer to almost all advanced western countries . 
  what makes the use of the phrases even more ridiculous in this case is that they 're being used to also describe * architecture * of all things . 
  the point i 'm making is that i think it 's absolutely worthless to explicitly and overly identify with values like ` inclusion ' and ` progression ' when they are held by every other western nation and when scotland has so many other unique cultural features . 
  you might as well be saying `` the building proudly represents scottish values of eating food and sleeping at night '' . 
  it 's meaningless , and moreso when scotland has n't had a culture of ` inclusion ' or ` progression ' until recent years anyway , just like every other part of the west . 
  cool link !, 
  i 'd heard some of those before in passing but was n't sure what they were called . 
  thanks !, 
  i said that they 're some of * my * favourite instances of such culture , not the definitive examples . 
  if you do n't like it you do n't have to watch them . 
  the modern far-right is fueled by islamists and islamic extremism . 
  islamic extremism is driven by ... islam . 
  that 's why it 's also called islamic * fundamentalism * . 
  the far-right had a stable low level of support before mass immigration , focusing on niche ` concerns ' like whether jews secretly control the world or not . 
  while the far-right core still believes that to be the case , they 've hidden that conspiracy-theory stuff for the time being and focused on the very real problem of islamic extremism . 
  if societal concerns over islam could be eased , then support for the far-right would collapse . 
  islamic attacks have occurred all throughout europe without provocation . 
  the only way to stop islamist terror is to radically alter immigration policies . 
  i have taken a very hard tone towards islam , but i do n't fit into the traditional ` far-right ' . 
  i actually 100 % want a ban on all future islamic immigration to britain because of the problems islam 's presence here has caused . 
  i 'm centrist in all other areas . 
  immigration is most important to me however . 
  [ here is an article from the year 2000 forecasting and seemingly celebrating that europe and the usa will be non-white majority in 2050 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/race.world ) . 
  the warning signs have been ignored for too long , and it 's driven me to hold views that other people will classify as ` far-right ' . 
  they 're saying `` hear , hear '' when they make that noise . 
  it 's not quite as bad as smashing your hands on the table like they do in the scottish parliament . 
  haha , i 'm sorry , but your username is really relevant here . 
  talk about a load of ` waffle ' . 
  architecture ca n't be ` thoughtful ' , and scotland does n't have values or traditions of ` inclusion ' or ` progression ' anymore than other advanced western societies . 
  inclusion and progression is universal to all such countries , from sweden to canada to germany to ireland and so on . 
  we * should * be proud of such ` inclusion ' , but to define one 's culture or set of values as ` inclusive ' is meaningless . 
  i have a real problem with the terms ` inclusive ' and ` progressive ' . 
  on separate occasions i 've seen the culture and values of scotland , london , canada , sweden and elsewhere all described by their leaders as ` inclusive ' , as though that 's a special value that should be cherished and held up as an example in equal merit to other , actual unique or representative national characteristics . 
  people talk about ` diversity ' , but its the drive to be more ` inclusive ' that 's making all of europe and the west so bland and similar . 
  scotland has a rich , 1000 year old culture that has nothing to do with ` inclusion ' or ` progression ' , the latter term which in modern usage refers to social policy and not * actual * examples of scottish ` progression ' such as the scottish enlightenment . 
  using such terms is just to trick people into thinking `` yes , this is devastatingly ugly and does not suit its surroundings , but at least its not a racist or oppressive building ! '', 
  that would be quite exciting . 
  i * almost * want it to happen , just to see what would come next . 
  i 'd rather the integrity of spain be maintained , of course .

  how about you downvoters explain why ? 
  what fantasy book are you reading from ? 
  the uk alone is n't to blame for the eu 's stifled ` progress ' , it 's merely the most vocal opposing member state . 
  if the eu * does * move towards much closer integration then the bloc will ultimately collapse . 
  there will be a time in europe when ever country must choose between being part of the eu and remaining an independent nation state . 
  it 'll be hard enough getting people western european nations to sign up for that level of integration ( unless their culture has been destroyed by immigration and eu policies ) , let alone people in eastern europe who largely look at the ongoing cultural revolution in western europe with distaste , and more or less only remain in the eu for development funds and as further protection from russian influence . 
  they wo n't be so desperate in 10-20 years time . 
  if the eu is still around in 20 years time , why would any country choose to join it ? 
  europe is declining in almost every sense , but most importantly in global economic terms . 
  there will be no desire to join the eu and follow its backwards customs union and single market rules or bizarre quota policies . 
  even your fetishised fantasy of a post-brexit uk in desperate economic straits would n't countenance becoming nothing other than a province of an isolated federal europe . 
  the eu will either stop integrating soon in the future , leading to the eternal impoverishment of countries in the eu that are bound by eurozone requirements in a bloc that is not integrated enough to bring about fiscal transfers between member states , or it will keep attempting to integrate and lead to further exits from the bloc until only a rump state remains . 
  this think tank is n't the british government . 
  if you * read * the article you 'd know that it proposes ireland leaving the eu because of how the country 's voice will become even more diminished inside the eu . 
  the think tank reckons that ireland 's position in the eu is untenable , and that the eu in brexit negotiations will act in the best interests of itself , rather than ireland . 
  eu membership has and * continues * to become less important to ireland than in previous years , with ireland now becoming a net contributor to the eu budget and because the eu is beginning to move towards projects unpleasant for ireland such as a united military and corporation tax harmonisation . 
  the uk with ireland ( and some other northern european states ) functioned as a sort of ideological bloc in the eu , and now that the uk is leaving the eu , that bloc will lose its most vocal member , likely leading to adverse policies that many small eu countries do n't want . 
  yes it absolutely is both . 
  eastern european immigrants are not a hivemind and do not function as one person . 
  some are unemployed and receive benefits , while others take jobs that displace working-class people . 
  no one can or should have everything they want . 
  this is asking for too much from society , is n't it enough that the gender reassignment surgery is funded by the nhs to begin with ? 
  the nhs is supposed to be for sickness and illness , not vanity .
