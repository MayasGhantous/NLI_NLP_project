  the fiscal transfers that northern ireland receives from the rest of the uk amount to nearly 5 % of irish gdp . 
  it 's the republic of ireland that 's the problem , the roi simply could never afford a united ireland . 
  if irish people in both countries truly cared about unification , they 'd proceed regardless of the cost . 
  the uk is n't corrupt . 
  your comments regarding the uk are always anti-british , and as per usual , such vitriol can easily be disproved with facts . 
  [ the uk was ranked as the 10th least corrupt nation in the 2016 corruption perceptions index . 
  ] ( https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016 ) ireland only makes it to the 19th spot , with the usa beating ireland to the 18th spot . 
  [ the uk government is also ranked as the most transparent in the world ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30883472 ) , measured in terms of access to official data . 
  if the uk is ` corrupt ' then what does that make the rest of the world ? 
  and once again , the cartoon is from over a year ago when the uk and usa were the fastest growing western major economies . 
  the eurozone beating forecasts is hardly something to rave about , talk about a low bar . 
  i do n't want the eurozone to suffer anyway , because of the negative impact on uk growth . 
  the main theme of the cartoon is globalisation , which you have n't addressed at all . 
  you ca n't claim that it 's propaganda without a more detailed deconstruction . 
  the cartoon is from over a year ago . 
  in any case , q1 growth is a poor way to judge whether an economy is growing at an annual rate . 
  the eurozone is predicted to expand by 1.8 % this year , and the uk is predicted to expand by 1.8 % -2 % this year . 
  the us is forecast to grow 2.1 % . 
  these figures are all easily obtainable from a quick google . 
  the truth is n't ` propaganda ' . 
  the main theme is n't economic , you should take a closer look and address the other issues . 
  try and disprove those if you feel up to it . 
  i 'm sorry , does that mean his political cartoon is ` invalid ' or ` unwelcome ' ? 
  what of all the german and other european lefties who dare comment on the us political scene without ever visiting the country ? 
  they 're all equally valid or invalid . 
  you do n't need to visit somewhere to know about it , we have a little thing called the internet now , sweetheart . 
  there * is * a migrant crisis in europe , there * is * a debt crisis in europe , greece * is * still the sick man of europe , sweden * is * suffering the effects of multiculturalism . 
  what point are you trying to make ? 
  should there be a ban or censor on anything that comes from americans that have political views you disagree with ? 
  it 's called a political cartoon , dear . 
  the issues mentioned in it ( albeit in a comical way ) are very real and very dangerous . 
  i suppose it 's propaganda though because you disagree with it and because it does n't have donald trump with small hands or something ? 
  [ we 're on our way , mate . 
  ] ( https://grrrgraphics.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/brexit_ben_garrison.jpg ), 
  are you sure you 're ` waiting ' ? 
  because you 're not exactly paying attention , are you ? 
  article 50 was triggered in march 2017 , brexit negotiations will take 2 years , therefore brexit is due to be complete some time around march 2019 . 
  if you 're waiting so badly , why not go read up on it and educate yourself . 
  it 's a poll by survation , they 're not a mature or prominent pollster , the results are essentially meaningless . 
  there 's not even information proving that they did n't speak to eu citizens for example . 
  regardless , the new ` remain ' vote in this poll still only sits at 54 % , hardly a sweeping victory that would symbolise a significant change in mood , even if the poll was representative of public opinion . 
  there is no real chance that the uk will stay in the eu , people really need to get over this bizarre delusion . 
   your pm sent a letter in old gunboat diplomacy fashion saying that if the uk does n't get favorable trade terms , security links may be weakened , to please voters like you . 
  the uk wants reciprocal terms with the eu , not a relationship harking back to the ` unequal treaties ' of the 19th century . 
  the emerging uk-eu relationship should at minimum match the eu 's relationship with other vital nato allies , like canada and the usa , or even turkey . 
  with all three countries , a trade deal is either already in place , has been approved or is being negotiated without stipulations requiring unnecessary payments , adherence to eu rules or freedom of movement . 
  that is the relationship befitting the uk today , if not a closer one because of proximity and deeper trade links . 
  i know that norway is n't in the eu , but merkel is n't the representative of the eu . 
  she is a european head of state and was talking about europe . 
  europe and the eu are not synonymous . 
  the uk will be the eu 's most important partner on the continent , and remain linked to the cooperative , multilateral foreign policy of other important european countries like france and germany , even as the uk leaves the eu . 
  in what way ? 
  how do you account for the following : [ uk and germany to sign new defence pact after article 50 is triggered ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-lastest-news-uk-germany-new-defence-pact-article-50-trigger-nato-europe-security-russia-us-a7638926.html ) [ norway , britain sign deal on increased defense cooperation ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-britain-defence-iduskbn13520q ) [ uk troops arrive in estonia for major nato deployment ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-troops-arrive-in-estonia-for-major-nato-deployment ) [ uk-french defence cooperation reaffirmed on fifth anniversary of lancaster house agreement ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-french-defence-cooperation-reaffirmed-on-fifth-anniversary-of-lancaster-house-agreement ) [ sweden and the united kingdom enhances defence cooperation ] ( http://www.government.se/articles/2016/06/sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-enhances-defence-cooperation/ ) [ uk troops to take on nato duties in poland and estonia ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36739781 ), 
  liechtenstein could have threatened the uk with sanctions , embargo , war or even thermonuclear annihilation , and no one would have batted an eyelid , regardless of its relationship with the eu . 
   lichtenstein can tell uk to get fucked lichtenstein has done no such thing , as you can see from the article itself :  liechtenstein said ` yes ' to the eea membership 22 years ago to get access to the eu market , and we consciously accepted the duties this entails , '' hasler said in a may 16 interview in vienna . 
  `` the effort is enormous for such a small country . 
  it 's absolutely key for us that this is recognized by the eu and we do n't find ourselves suddenly worse off than the u.k. , which turned its back on the eu . '' * essentially this is an admittance of liechtenstein 's complete lack of power , even within europe . 
  the country is not in the eu and can not affect its decisions , so in order to maintain its own relationship with the eu , it is parroting statements made by other european leaders as an act of tribute . 
  the eu does n't amplify liechtenstein 's voice , it reduces it to that of a subordinate . 
  the same is true of several weak eu member states which i wo n't list out of politeness . 
  ultimately however , the uk does n't want a ` better deal ' as defined by the eu . 
  the uk no longer sees freedom of movement as a ` benefit ' . 
  ` sharing ' fishing waters is not a ` benefit ' . 
  the eu has been rejected in britain , and the uk 's new relationship will be shaped around this new understanding . 
  what some eu federalists like yourself think , is that the eu is going to start treating the uk like russia , serbia or iran or something . 
  the eu 's relationship with the uk will resemble its relationship with the usa or canada . 
  even the most strained relationship between the eu and uk will remain that of close allies , simply because of the relationships between the uk and the eu 's core members , like [ france ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-french-defence-cooperation-reaffirmed-on-fifth-anniversary-of-lancaster-house-agreement ) and [ germany ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-lastest-news-uk-germany-new-defence-pact-article-50-trigger-nato-europe-security-russia-us-a7638926.html ) . 
  those of you who dream of bizarre punitive measures against the uk are going to have a hard time dealing with reality . 
  a uk-eu trade deal will be done by 2020 , mark my words . 
  every so often it * seems * as though the uk is going to get serious about space , whether that be by [ building a spaceport ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38920584 ) or by providing more funding for the skylon re-usable spaceplane project , but ultimately the government either continuously delays decisions or provides such negligible funding that no real progress ever seems to be made . 
  perhaps if the beagle 2 mission had been successful , there would have been more public interest and support for future endeavours . 
  obviously if britain had been connected to the continent , then our ancestors would have focused on land power , rather than overwhelmingly on sea power . 
  in 1889 for example , britain adopted the so-called ` two-power standard ' , which meant that the royal navy had to be equal to or stronger than the world 's next two largest navies combined . 
  in such an alternative world and had britain still developed an overseas empire , there could have been a situation where hundreds of thousands indian troops would have been stationed in britain . 
  1 million indian soldiers served in ww1 after all , and 2.5 million in ww2 . 
  i think it 's much more likely that britain as we know it simply would n't exist in the first place , however . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2koyuc-4mq0 ), 
  might as well let them , they 'll be the ones who get laughed at . 
  that 's not necessarily certain . 
  losing east germany today would be a reduction of 16 million people , with the west german population being just 65 million today . 
  this compares with 66 million in france and 64 million in the uk . 
  obviously population is n't an absolute indicator of economic or geopolitical power , but already today the [ population of the united german state is forecast to shrink from a total of 81 million to 66 million by 2060 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/world/europe/germany-fights-population-drop.html ) . 
  in contrast , the [ uk population may reach up to 81 million by that time ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18854762 ) ( largely dependent by the future of rate of migration to britain of course ) . 
  [ largely because of these demographic shifts , the uk is already forecast to become the largest economy in europe by the mid 2030s ] ( https://data.oecd.org/chart/4pp9 ) with france in 3rd spot but now only behind germany by a fraction . 
  it 's difficult therefore to imagine a reduced west germany in the 2040s , perhaps consisting of just 55-60 million people , maintaining sway over a europe where power is already seemingly realigning into regional blocks like the [ visegrad group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) ( population today 64 million ) . 
  there 's something about much of the countryside in northwestern europe that just feels so ancient and mystical . 
  it looks empty but simultaneously seems so alive with pre-christian civilisation . 
  you look upon vistas that would have been identical to what the ancient druids saw . 
  this is absolutely not the case . 
  the uk is normally the one concerned about maintaining the special relationship in the face of perceived american disinterest . 
  no one in the conservative government would seek to weaken this relationship under any circumstances . 
  indeed it is precisely because of this ` special relationship ' that the uk can make such direct complaints and be taken seriously . 
  the response given by trump ( like him or not ) is more potent and friendly towards the uk than any received during the obama years . 
   `` the leaks of sensitive information pose a grave threat to our national security , '' trump said . 
  `` there is no relationship we cherish more than the special relationship between the united states and the united kingdom . '' there are a few in the uk concerned with the lack of professionalism , but these leaks are down to a difference is culture and norms regarding such information . 
  no one currently in power seeks to weaken the relationship . 
  there is no relationship paralleled in the world regarding security , intelligence , nuclear cooperation , defence and so on between the us and uk . 
  it is a relationship which cements the links between the usa and the rest of europe ( nato transcends the eu ) and the other anglosphere countries , like canada , australia and new zealand . 
  despite various ups and downs , the relationship has been a vital pillar of global security since the end of ww2 . 
  ah so it 's more acceptable to slit throats if it 's not for religious purposes , okay .
