  who knows what catalonia 's credit rating would be ? 
  it 's absolutely ridiculous when you think about it . 
  just a ploy to increase pressure on the spanish government , really . 
  a couple of soldiers opening fire after being attacked with rocks is more tame then you 'd find elsewhere , especially during the time period . 
  there are countless examples , from the times when american forces have stormed cultist groups , from when the ussr crushed dissent or even when algerian protesters in paris were killed it 's completely unremarkable . 
  the fact that only 14 people died when the crowds were as big as 15,000 shows this . 
  it 's because of british moderation , shown countless times like via the original use of rubber bullets and in the footage like [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/vkopgr1elxg?t=4m45s ) . 
  no civilian deaths were ever deliberately caused by the british army . 
  same ca n't be said for the ira and other republican groups who alone still carry out acts of violence and murder today . 
  that 's some eye-opening stuff , just like this [ genuine footage of the middle east ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw5n4sioj9s ) .

  the uk would never starve in any situation . 
  this is an era of super-massive cargoships . 
  ireland is lucky to supply the british market , not the other way around . 
  while london is rich , it does n't automatically make the rest of the country ` destitute ' . 
  most of wales is lovely , as you would know if you lived there or visited . 
  if this is n't what the voters wanted , then there 'd be a real call for a second referendum and the conservatives would n't have a massive lead in the polls . 
  i 'm * very * happy with these three points , and so are most people . 
  because it 's bullshit, 
   no wonder everybody hates our guts [ this is demonstrably not true . 
  ] ( https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/67748000/jpg/_67748860_67748859.jpg ) it 's from [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22624104 ) if you want to read further . 
  the people who hate the uk and british people the most are ultra left-wing brits , like those who 've currently taken charge of the labour party . 
  ... no ... do n't be a prat . 
  because of clear socio-economic factors . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gni_ ( nominal , _ atlas_method ) _ per_capita the gross national income in the uk is $ 43,340 , while in poland it 's $ 13,370 , as an example of one statistic . 
  uk migrants in the eu are generally highly-skilled , while polish migrants in the uk tend to be lesser skilled . 
  [ eu migrants make up 11 % of the uk manufacturing workforce for example ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39576112 ) , and they 'll almost exclusively be eastern european migrants , rather than from germany , sweden or the netherlands . 
  it could be unpleasant for both sides in that scenario . 
  it 's a rather precarious situation for the eu as well . 
  [ there are 900,000 british citizens in the rest of the eu ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/27/fewer-britons-in-rest-of-europe-than-previously-thought-ons-research ) , while there are almost 3 million eu citizens in the uk . 
  only 189,000 of these british citizens in the eu are aged over 65 ( therefore very likely retired ) . 
  it goes without saying that these brits in europe are going to generally be wealthier and better placed to remain in europe after brexit than the 916,000 polish people alone for example that currently live in the uk . 
  many of the demonstrators have traveled there from the republic of ireland . 
  it 's very misleading . 
  no * real * call for it either , as more people in northern ireland speak polish than irish . 
  islands do n't belong to people . 
  the island of ireland has only ever been unified as an english client state , as part of the united kingdom , or as a dominion of the british empire ( for about 3 days ) . 
  the island of ireland is not a single entity that must be brought into a single state in accordance to some destiny . 
  you 're clearly bound by an obsessive nationalism . 
  irish nationalism in 1880 sought to create an irish state , or at the very least lead to a degree of autonomy . 
  both of those already exist today in the form of the republic of ireland and the self-governing component country of the uk that is northern ireland . 
  any call to expand the borders of the republic of ireland , to annex northern ireland , is modern-day irredentist imperialism . 
  if the people in northern ireland choose to join the republic of ireland of their own accord , then it is self-determination . 
  that process is facilitated by the british government via the good friday agreement . 
  [ the british army is responsible for the absolute minority of those deaths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles#/media/file:troubles_deaths_by_perpetrator.png ) . 
  [ british soldiers are responsible for 363 deaths , while republican paramilitaries are responsible for the largest amount of deaths , over 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles#responsibility ) . 
  irish terrorism sought to demoralise the british government into abandoning northern ireland and its people , and force the people of northern ireland into accepting union with a country they did n't want . 
  british military action was in self-defence and to protect the right of self-determination of the people of northern ireland . 
  you have the ability to move to the republic of ireland if you really wish to be removed from ` british rule ' . 
  if i wanted to live under dutch rule rather than british rule , i 'd have to move to the netherlands , northern ireland is n't a colony . 
  a border poll can be held whenever the population there want it to be , and it can join the roi whenever it wants to . 
  [ only 22 % of people support doing so however , even after brexit ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37309706 ) . 
  there is no ` irish cause ' . 
  it 's not the 1880s . 
  just a shot in the dark , but are you one of those semi-sentient americans who 's become aware of the widespread shortages of their own culture and society , so has instead parasitically latched onto an imagined irish identity and heritage which they misinterpret as an unwavering hatred of the uk , which they can only further by expressing their support for child-murdering terrorists ? 
  if you want to start discerning values , then one can very effectively argue that those values are more british than continental . 
  historical incarnations of the uk have been at the forefront of democracy and personal freedom during their contemporary eras . 
  only a choice few countries in europe have retained free or liberal societies ( comparative to their time periods ) over the centuries , and the uk is one of them . 
  i do n't think i need to explain ` not bowing down to tyrants ' * cough napoleon , kaiser wilhelm ii , hitler cough * . 
  britain is the birthplace of freedom of the press and many other civil liberties , and at several times in history has been the refuge of such values when authoritarianism has swept the continent . 
  why is it not surprising that foul practices such as the slave trade and child labour were first outlawed by britain ? 
  britain has a long history as the home of such values , stretching back to the setting out of the magna carta in england in 1215 . 
  far from being common in europe , these values only returned/first arrived in many parts of the continent in the latter half of the 20th century , whether that be in post-ww2 germany , post-1970s spain or post-soviet eastern europe . 
  it 's easy for many eu-supporters to blame the uk for the union 's lack of progress , but the truth is that the uk 's opposition to deeper integration has long been taken for granted by many other member states , from ireland to denmark , to the netherlands , sweden and poland , among others . 
  expect them all to be more vocal now that the uk is withdrawing from the european project . 
  just wait a couple months . 
  [ do you get all your political views from cartoons ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxhwtw_gzik ), 
  the uk is not poland or the ukraine or any other former soviet , former dictatorship backwater that has been uplifted by funds from other eu members . 
  the uk already had an advanced developed economy . 
  we do n't know exactly what the uk would be like if it had n't joined the eec , but it would n't be a poor backwater because it was already a developed nation and it already had many previous commonwealth and international trade links which likely would have continued to grow over the 20th century and beyond . 
  forgive me if i do n't see the african union as a success story . 
  regardless , the uk has n't been saved from the ravages of war by being in the european union . 
  you ca n't compare the uk to random parts of eastern and southern europe . 
  it just does n't work . 
  correlation does not equal causation . 
  the uk economy was revitalised after the ` big bang ' in the city of london which restored its position as the world 's largest financial centre , and the discovery of north sea oil for obvious reasons . 
  prosperity has increased globally because of the reduction of war , instability and trade tariffs everywhere ... unless you mean to say that for example south korea 's transformation is because of the eu too ? 
  maybe the eu deserves the nobel economic prize as well , after already securing the peace prize ... just for existing ... 
  the uk has always been a net contributor to the european project . 
  any money being spent on uk regions is merely the redistribution of british money that goes into the project . 
  eu funds did n't make the uk ` grow prosperous enough to create the harry potter series ' . 
  the uk has been one of the richest countries in the world since the 1500s ( england before the acts of union ) . 
  the uk is n't an impoverished backwater that was saved from the brink by joining the eec ( look to north sea oil and the deregulation of the banks instead ) . 
  regarding harry potter specifically , the uk is home to some of the oldest publishing houses in the world . 
  j.k rowling 's imagination and writing successes have nought to do with the eu , and the film series was produced in collaboration with the americans . 
  as for the british film industry itself , it existed and thrived long before the eu and is behind some of the most iconic films in the world , from * lawrence of arabia * to * a clockwork orange * to * the wicker man * to * alien * to the well-known franchises of today such as harry potter . 
  little of this has anything to do with the eu . 
  the eu has a few of its own successes , but too many proponents of the eu begin to retell history and claim the successes and achievements of others as those of the european union . 
  this harry potter example demonstrates how absurd that can often be . 
   this is a great way to tackle class inequality . 
  not in every case . 
  [ scotland within the uk does not have tuition fees ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/scottish-universities-worst-in-the-uk-for-admitting-poorer-students-despite-having-no-tuition-fees-a7051521.html )  young disadvantaged scottish people are four times less likely to go to university than their wealthier counterparts .
