  in england the same figure is 2.4 , while in wales and northern ireland , poorer students are three times more likely to do so . 
   the report has also found that virtually all the improvements in getting disadvantaged scottish students places in he over the last decade ( 90 per cent ) has been provided by colleges , and not universities . 
  [ the uk does less than half its trade with the eu however ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/why-eu-trade-is-vital-for-britain-s-economy-in-two-charts-a7126676.html ) . 
  the uk is a strong , dynamic country with a robust-enough economy to weather a potential decrease in european trade over the years by also securing new trade deals internationally . 
  an independent scotland within the eu could do no such thing . 
   i think indyref2 will stand a much better chance of success after brexit is complete and everyone sees the full consequences . 
  yeah , scots are really going to vote to leave the uk for an uncertain position in europe , where membership of the eu will be predicated on a commitment to join the euro and schengen area , both of which are deeply unpopular , stupid concepts . 
  scottish independence is now less feasible than before . 
  no one is going to pick unrestricted trade with the eu over unrestricted trade with the rest of the uk , [ as scotland does over 4x more trade with the rest of the uk than the rest of the eu combined ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38743532 ) .

  how does 1.9 % of votes for the bnp in the 2010 election transform into 12 % of votes for ukip in 2015 ? 
  most votes came from conservatives and labour . 
  do n't make shit up . 
  i 'm not saying he 's right or wrong , but the point is that his sort of talk is n't widely tolerated in the uk at the moment , while it clearly is in the netherlands and france and elsewhere in europe . 
   something has gone seriously wrong in the uk  british fascism oh take a look in the mirror . 
  ukip is nothing like the far-right in mainland europe . 
  the things that geert wilders has said about islam and migrants in the netherlands would be completely unacceptable in the uk . 
  it would be a complete scandal if anyone said stuff like that and they 'd be forced to stand down . 
  the party for freedom is equal to the british national party , which at their height recieved just 1.9 % of the vote . 
  unlike in the netherlands where a real fascist party was voted for by 13 % of voters . 
  sort your own problems out . 
  and it 's disproportionately male suicide as well in many countries . 
  the uk ranks surprisingly well in this chart , but still , in 2013 , [ 78 % of all suicides in the uk were male suicides ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/19/number-of-suicides-uk-increases-2013-male-rate-highest-2001 ) . 
  i imagine it 's similar across all europe , but this link does n't mention gender , and after googling i ca n't find anything from the eu commission about male suicide , despite plenty regarding female rights and female-focused gender equality . 
  ' 0-hour contracts ' never mean someone goes without work for an entire week . 
  it 's a flexible form of part-time work , incredibly useful to mothers , students and the like . 
  what really bothers me is that the strengths or achievements of uk are always seen as an illusion by your type , and you pretend that really the uk is a backwater . 
  the uk only has low unemployment because it fudges the numbers , the uk is only the world 's 5th largest economy because of the eu , london is only the world 's largest financial centre because of the eu , it goes on and on , despite the eu and single market only existing since 1993 . 
  0-hour contracts are a legitimate form of employment , and they 're used in much of europe , even if they 're more ` regulated ' in some parts . 
  [ only 2.9 % of workers are on such contracts ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/uk-workers-zero-hours-contracts-rise-tuc ) , and even if you bizarrely removed * all * of those from the employment figures , the uk 's unemployment rate still be among the lowest in europe . 
  the uk will manage just as well as the 180 + countries that are not part of the eu . 
  other unions such as asean are purely trade blocs , which is what the eu should have remained . 
  it must be awful being you .

  [ do i need a passport to travel between ireland and france ? 
  ] ( https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/france/passports/top-passport-questions/to-travel-between-country-and-ireland/ )  irish citizens travelling between france and ireland must hold a valid passport . 
   for french citizens wishing to travel to ireland , a valid national identity card or passport is necessary . 
  the passport or identification card should be valid for the duration of the stay . 
  an identity card is permissible for a stay of less than 90 days . 
  for longer periods , a valid passport is necessary . 
   only valid identification cards and passports are accepted . 
  no , the exemption was ` granted ' as a preliminary concession for british and irish membership of the bloc during the 1970s when the european project was still being shaped . 
  it is n't because they 're island nations purely , though that factor influenced the uk and ireland 's desire to remain outside schengen . 
  * all * current eu members bar uk and ireland are legally bound to join schengen , and no new members are allowed opt-outs . 
  the eu is n't going to give scotland an opt-out on this core issue and risk the entire eu integration project . 
  there 's * every * reason to believe that scotland will need to commit to schengen to secure eu membership , and ultimately be forced to join it at a later date , if not immediately prior to eu accession . 
  not to the same degree as they can across much of mainland europe . 
  eu citizens need to show a passport to get into the uk or ireland ( not between northern ireland and roi ) . 
  that 's not true in much of mainland europe . 
  denmark only started checking for passports at its southern border since 2016 after the migrant crisis, 
  because eu citizens ca n't just waltz into the roi and then cross into the uk currently . 
  that 's because ireland is n't in the schengen zone . 
  that 's because ireland is n't in schengen , whereas an independent scotland in the eu would be . 
  idk how many more times this needs to be pointed out . 
  the uk-ireland common travel area was agreed before the eu existed , back in 1922 . 
  the uk and ireland have always had an opt-out of schengen . 
  an independent scotland , as a new eu member , would have no legal right to ` op-out ' and will * have * to join schengen and have a closed border with ruk . 
  as far as i 'm aware , all new member states of the eu must join schengen , and that the uk and ireland have opt-outs so they can maintain their previous travel area . 
  scotland would join the eu as a new member meaning it would have to be part of schengen , and this prevents them from joining the cta , because it would be unacceptable ruk voters for an independent scotland to act as a gateway to european immigration into the ruk . 
  some of them are pretty crap . 
  just rotated or upside down versions or recombinations of tricolours of other flags , belgium and germany , france and the netherlands , italy and hungary and so on . 
  do n't recognise the website so not gon na click on it , but the union jack is unquestionably the best . 
  absolutely stunning ( which is why it 's become a popular design globally recently ) , and [ what makes it so impressive , is how it is essentially the product of the chance union of the countries and flags of the british isles . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvzqapdkwlo ) a flag that truly represents the nation . 
  i do n't even understand why most european flags are the way they are . 
  take the italian flag for example :  some have attributed particular values to the colours , and a common interpretation is that the green represents the country 's plains and the hills ; white , the snow-capped alps ; and red , blood spilt in the wars of italian independence . 
  a more religious interpretation is that the green represents hope , the white represents faith , and the red represents charity ; this references the three theological virtues . 
  the colours and design are more or less meaningless . 
  you can easily disregard this weak attempt at explaining them . 
  some despot clearly just liked the combination . 
  it is a nice flag but it does n't mean anything . 
  that 's my opinion anyway . 
  ireland should be ashamed that it did n't contribute to defeating fascism in ww2 . 
  no , you ca n't just appropriate other values and put them under the umbrella of ` progressive ' . 
  what you 've listed are centuries old and not connected to the warped ideology referred to as ` progressive ' today . 
  the term today refers to mind rot like [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2015/jan/30/is-it-time-we-agreed-on-a-gender-neutral-singular-pronoun ) , and other backwards concepts like transgender children . 
   ` loyalist ' hm , okay . 
  not exactly a nail bomb though , is it ? 
  the true colour of irish nationalism is n't green , it 's blood red . 
  well i just added that point in an edit actually , and it 's important because it just reveals how hopeless the position of an independent scotland would be economically . 
  she cites sweden as example of the eu not forcing member states to join the euro , but sweden was a member of the eu * before * the euro existed . 
  it ca n't really kick sweden out over the issue , but it * can * refuse scottish accession , which would become predicated on euro membership . 
  indeed there 's no other option for the eu , because any deviation would symbolically show the rest of europe that integration is now negotiable , and it would greatly weaken integration efforts in eastern europe and elsewhere . 
  for example , ultimately the eu wants all member states to join the euro , so why make a damaging concession now to scotland , which is home to just 5m people and would n't be a net contributor to the eu budget ? 
  it would shatter the hard-line position of the eu in all talks with other eu candidate countries and those still integrating in the east . 
  scotland in the eu would need to join the euro and schengen , creating a [ hard border with the rest of the uk , with whom scotland does 4x more trade than with the eu combined . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38743532 ) scotland could not join the common travel area between the uk and ireland , as that agreement dates from 1922 , and uk and irish eu membership was formed around that existing agreement . 
  she also points to greece 's debt ratio to gdp as an indicator that the eu does not prevent countries with a debt of more that 3 % to be in the eu/euro , but once again , greece was already a member before it racketed up that debt . 
  scotland already [ has a deficit of 9.7 % ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/15bn-tax-deficit-heart-wales-11131738 ) , currently shored up by the uk .
