  northern ireland opted to remain part of the uk , it 's the irredentist ambitions of frenzied irish nationalists which is imperialist in nature by wanting to annex part of another country . 
  do n't project your own inadequacy onto the uk . 
  you 're clearly so ashamed/embarrassed of where you come from , that you 've adopted a pan-european identity instead so you can steal the history , culture and achievements of all europe , rather than be bound by that of whatever insignificant country you come from . 
  the eu is practically a non-entity geopolitically and an economic basket case . 
  it 's failed in bringing north africa into its orbit , it has no influence in the middle east and has even lost power in turkey . 
  it has abandoned sub-saharan africa to the chinese and is barely considered by the usa , which focuses in europe on the member states of nato . 
  the uk might not be the superpower it once was , but it still dwarfs most other eu countries and has more influence than the floundering eu , as a country with a permanent seat at the un security council with veto power as a recognised nuclear power , which is consistently ranked first or second in terms of soft power , is home to the world 's largest financial centre , is a world leader in finance , aerospace , pharmaceuticals and military arms , has a cultural capital second only to the usa 's , with british culture being enjoyed globally , which can be seen in countless ways . 
  british artists account for [ 1 in 6 global album sales for example ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36332019 ) . 
  not a crazy nationalist , but i 've got to describe this to you in order to dispel your bizarre claims and accusations . 
  your pathetic anglophobic views do not change reality , which is that the uk has n't been in decline since the 1980s after the initial boost of north sea oil and the revitalisation of the british economy triggered by financial deregulation in the city of london . 
  remind me which side it is that 's known for [ blowing up city centres and massacring civilians ?

   20 % of people who would n't have voted for a united ireland would vote for a united ireland as a result of brexit . 
  no , that 22 % is the value after the 8/10 ratio is already taken into account . 
   sinn f\u00e9in are actively cleansing their image , shedding their ira links ( adams is rumoured to be stepping down this year ) and they are marketing themselves as an inclusive , progressive party . 
  dup are doing the opposite . 
  it appeals to a large demographic right now , mostly older , conservative voters . 
  their attitude and demographic that they play to is n't likely to be a strategy that will carry well into the future . 
   older dup voters dying off and younger nationalists coming of age generation z ( the generation that follows millennials ) have already shown themselves to [ be much more conservative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generation_z#political_views ) and traditional than their preceding generation . 
  ` progressiveness ' is a failed , fleeting ideology and is being increasingly rejected . 
  the 22 % in favour is already affected by the 20 % voting intention change . 
  [ border poll survey says 8/10 voters unchanged by brexit ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37309706 )  if such a poll is held , a clear majority of people , 63 % , say they will vote for northern ireland to remain in the uk , while only 22 % would support a united ireland . 
  not likely . 
  please tell me this is a joke/parody video you 've linked to , it makes me feel physically sick . 
  the racial component alone is disgusting enough ( actively campaigning for the decline of the native demographic ) , but what enrages me so is the utter depravity of saying that ` old swedes ' need to integrate with ` new swedes ' , and that swedish culture needs to adapt for migrants , rather than calling for those migrants adopt swedish values . 
  in the uk , at least the prevailing view at the moment is that migrants should integrate and adopt british values . 
  degenerate , filthy bastards . 
  all the more reason to have closed borders with the rest of europe after brexit . 
  how much longer until ` french ' , ` german ' or ` swedish ' migration to the uk becomes code for algerian , turkish and somalian migration . 
  i seriously hope that once brexit is over and done with , the public can rally for tight immigration controls for the third-world next . 
  the continent is doomed , but there 's still a chance to save britain . 
  [ i doubt they 'd allow this sort of discussion on swedish tv , which aired on the bbc this week . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ov9nq1fufi ), 
  the spectator is a respected and reputable magazine . 
  it 's hardly the express . 
  pre-colonial sub-saharan africa had n't even reached the level of civilisation found in europe 2000 years ago . 
  hmm !, 
  [ he certainly was a joke , even to children ] ( https://youtu.be/smqoiuh4sqe?t=1s ), 
   brexit happened because politicians there were trying to pursue a different agenda to the rest of the eu . 
  no , brexit happened because of freedom of movement across a continent of vastly different incomes and qualities of life . 
  it 's not ` normal ' for there to be 1 million polish-born people in the uk , a group of people who became the largest foreign-born group here after barely 10 years . 
  a massive , irreversible , cultural shift no british citizen consented to . 
  no surprise when given the chance in the eu ref , so many voted to end freedom of movement . 
  it does n't really matter that the uk gov failed to implement temporary barriers , as some other eu countries did ( blame tony blair ) , because such restrictions would have come to an end in 2011 or so , as they did in germany , and the discontent would merely be delayed for around 6 years . 
  in the last few years , the ` phenomena ' has been repeating with romanian and bulgarian migrants . 
  [ there were already 223,000 romanians in the uk in 2015 , up from 128,000 in 2013 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36704783 ) . 
  who knows what the number is now ? 
  and it 's a problem , because on my local police wanted list , among a minority of british names , all i see are polish names , bulgarian names , romanians names . 
  they might not commit * all * the crime , but i can see plenty of thefts , frauds and assaults that would n't have happened had those individuals not been allowed into the country . 
  we are getting the worst people from these countries , and have n't been able to do anything about it because of freedom of movement . 
  i want the uk to have a more restrictive immigration system , where criminals or unskilled , undesirable migrants likely to commit crime ca n't come to the uk . 
  ` good ' or desireable eastern european migrants should still be welcome , families and the like , but i 'm fed up of seeing shifty migrants drinking their cheap polish beer on bridges during the daytime and worrying about my house being burgled by some junkie vagrant . 
  it was n't like this 10 years ago . 
  yes , of course , i would have been praising or criticising the message ... if there was one . 
  this represents europe no more than the music that plays at the start of a game of pac-man . 
  isis , really ? 
  you do n't see steve bannon , nigel farage , donald trump or any other boogeymen of the right beheading children , burning men alive , stoning women to death for adultery after being raped , using children as human shields , committing genocide on minorities and dissidents , committing terrorist attacks at weddings , schools , markets , hospitals and so on . 
  you can access the single market to different degrees . 
  non-eu countries can access the market , but they do n't have * membership * of it . 
  theresa may has said that the uk is leaving the single market , but that our level of access needs to be negotiated . 
  ideally , the uk wants a free-trade deal with the eu , like the eu already has with many other countries with which it does not share freedom of movement . 
  think of the recent eu trade deal with canada for example . 
  as a ` soft brexit ' is off the cards , ultimately it seems that there will either be a eu-uk trade deal alongside other agreements , such as reciprocity guarantees for citizens in the uk and eu , or no deal where the uk reverts to wto trade rules and everything else remains unclear . 
  boris johnson is the foreign secretary and a potential future prime minister . 
  his words hold some weight and are likely rooted in meaningful senior conservative discussion , as are those of other senior conservatives . 
  even if they have thus far not achieved it , reducing unskilled immigration has been a long-established aim of the party . 
  the uk already has a points based system in place , and it will almost certainly be adapted when freedom of movement comes to an end in 2019 . 
  it 's unquestionable that skilled immigration will still be facilitated in the same way it is now . 
  providing that information is accurate ... then this is truly degenerate . 
  all of european culture and musical ingenuity disregarded for the nonsensical babbling of a two-year old ? 
  how does that represent * anything * , let alone europe . 
  how fitting that this was made for the artificial and meaningless so-called ` european union ' . 
   the meaning of the words is up to you . 
  making random noises and not even bothering to assign them meaning or purpose is not art or music . 
  europe is better than this , or at least i thought it was . 
  our ancestors mourn the passing of western civilisation . 
  it 's been suggested by some high-ranking conservatives . 
  michael gove and boris johnson both touted it during the brexit campaign . 
  may has n't set out any real policy on immigration yet , apart from committing to reducing it to the 10s of thousands . 
  anything like that will ultimately require a stronger-points based system . 
  what are the lyrics of this abomination ? 
  well the idea would be to end freedom of movement with the eu as it is currently , bringing a great reduction in * unskilled * immigration , but have a generous points-based system to allow the easy migration of skilled workers to the uk . 
  you have to remember that such an outcome is risky for both the uk and eu . 
  if you disregard veiled threats from theresa may regarding security and defence for example , there are still other potential negatives for the eu . 
  some w. european countries like the netherlands trade more with the uk than others , and asking people in those countries , where the eu is already somewhat unpopular , to take a disproportionate financial hit just to make a political point to the uk , could have great implications . 
  eu action to ` punish ' the uk and discourage euroscepticism in other eu countries could backfire and just create further division within europe . 
  it 's a statistic from the financial times ... hardly a dominion of the brexiteers . 
  perhaps you see the statistic used so often simply because it 's correct ? 
  it will come to pass that only car exports to the uk market will be threatened . 
  the threat of eu collapse is overblown and wo n't be increased by a uk-eu trade deal . 
  ultimately it will become clear that only exports to the uk market are at risk , and that 's what exporters will be concerned with . 
   `` we hope for pragmatism from all parties in the brexit negotiations , '' said mr krueger . 
  `` that means no new barriers to trade , free movement for skilled workers . '' funnily enough , that 's what the * uk * wants as well . 
  the only exports at risk are those to the uk market . 
  the eu is n't going to unravel because of the uk leaving . 
  any dissolution will be in decades to follow and be the result of poor eu policy , not because of an eu-uk free trade deal . 
  ultimately sense will prevail when it becomes clear only exports to the uk are those being threatened . 
   harsh punishments the eu wo n't be able to exact a ` punishment ' on the uk if there 's no deal . 
  a situation without a deal is one where all ties are cut , the uk reverts to wto rules and both parties deal with the tariffs and restrictions that are reintroduced . 
  that 's a * passive * event .
