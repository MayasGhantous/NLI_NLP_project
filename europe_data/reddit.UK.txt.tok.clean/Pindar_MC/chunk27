  there 's no situation after that in which the eu can still ` punish ' the uk that does n't involve something close to sanctions , which is an absolute non-scenario , as it would lead to an end to all uk-eu cooperation . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/f6cda050-20bb-11e5-aa5a-398b2169cf79  about a fifth of all cars produced in germany last year , or around 820,000 vehicles , were exported to the uk , making it the single biggest destination by volume . 
  you joke , but i 'm sure german car * manufacturers * want a * good * deal with the uk . 
  ha ha , good job eu !, 
  please also send some magic rainbows to chechnya if you have enough spare . 
  if the eu paints a massive rainbow , hopefully the gay people being beheaded and worked to death in prison camps there can take some solace in knowing that the eu wo n't let their executioners get away without being trolled !, 
  i did read it , and it goes without saying how premature it is to make any conclusions based on single quarter or a single year , especially after the immediate shock of the eu referendum result . 
  things will return to ` normal ' once the outline of the brexit deal becomes clearer and confidence returns . 
  really ? 
  why did n't it whilst he was minister of the economy , finance and industry then ? 
  was n't that his job before ? 
  seems like he 'll be worse-placed to implement such a strategy now when he 'll have so many other issues to deal with . 
  while it is n't a ranking of fintech exactly , the [ global financial centres index ] ( http://www.longfinance.net/images/gfci/gfci_21.pdf ) ranks london as the largest financial centre in the world . 
  paris is in the 29th spot , behind even melbourne , and montreal . 
  there 's not going to be a mass exodus of financial services from london , even to frankfurt , which is in the 23rd spot for those interested . 
  it 's just hyperbole . 
  yes , i remember when they did [ a bit about this place on bbc newsnight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjdby0imfaw ) before the referendum . 
  it 's the sort of thing that makes sensible british people tut and shake their heads , because it 's just so obviously a waste of time and money , and only serves ideological purposes . 
  things like this , even if marginally , definitely contribute to euroscepticism in the uk . 
  well , according to the dataset , germany received 626,710,000,000 euros investment ( 21.5 % eu total ) and the next highest is france which received 486,482,000,000 euros ( 16.7 % eu total ) , so germany still leads in gross terms !, 
  the data is specifically measuring * gross fixed capital formation by an_f6 asset type * , and from what i can tell , an_f6 assets cover non-financial assets , including buildings and structures , machinery and equipment , transport , ict , weapons systems , cultivated biological sources and intellectual property products . 
  so it does n't cover * all * forms of investment , so the * absolute * level of investment may be * slightly * different from this graph . 
  pull the other one , the uk is one of the [ least corrupt countries in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index ) , and the uk gov has been [ ranked as the most transparent ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30883472 ) in regards to measurements such as access to official government data and documents . 
  accusations were made , and they 've been investigated and the claims rejected by two independent bodies . 
  this is democracy in action . 
  there 's no such thing as eu ` values ' . 
  the eu only imposes its ` values ' on the near-despotic regimes of eastern europe , and those values are decided by the powerful western members beforehand . 
  i 'd say however , that when ireland voted to legalise gay marriage , it did so by its * own * values and merit . 
  it 's got nothing to do with the eu , and the eu should n't appropriate the successes of its member states as its own . 
  eu countries are rich , happy and stable , but that 's got nothing to do with the eu , it 's because of their own merit , in the same way that new zealand is rich , happy and stable while not in the eu . 
  this post should be as equally ridiculed as if i said `` when did your country last stand up for british values '' , and listed them as ` human dignity and human rights , freedom , democracy , equality and the rule of law ' . 
  britain has done more to advance them globally than the eu has though , that 's for sure . 
  that 's true , but as the vote on eu membership for many was synonymous with a vote on ` uncontrolled ' eu migration , it makes sense that so many would have voted to leave the eu . 
  if we had a vote on ` non-eu migration ' , i think people would have preferred to reduce that instead , as eu migrants are more willing and able to integrate for example . 
  unfortunately we was n't given that choice . 
   growth of racism and xenophobia here in the u.k. 
  this has n't happened . 
  there 's been no increase in racism , it 's just that more and more people are refusing to blindly accept drivel about immigration and ` diversity ' being infallibly beneficial to society . 
  this has happened because net immigration to the uk was on average [ 104,000 a year in the 1990s ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/25/race.world ) , but by 2015 it had more than [ * tripled * to 336,000 a year . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34931725 ) the scale of immigration has transformed london from a city which was [ 80 % white british in 1991 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/london-europes-new-ethnic-melting-pot-1525506.html ) to a city just [ 45 % white british in 2012 ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/census-reveals-white-britons-as-minority-in-capital-for-first-time-8405998.html ) . 
  entire communities have n't just been transformed , but entirely torn apart , as self-isolating ethno-cultural ghettos form , pushing up violent crime and social decay . 
  being opposed to that is n't racist or xenophobic . 
  you really do further the delusion . 
  if i were an american , i 'd be incredibly unimpressed with the way various foreigners claim american achievements . 
  walt disney 's father was a canadian who was born to irish parents . 
  that does n't make him irish you utter travesty . 
  irish ancestry does n't trump the english , german and other ancestry in an individual.regardless , he is a product of the usa , american culture , industry , institutions and work ethic . 
  the same is true in all other cases you 've listed which are questionable to say the least . 
  even the claim of jfk being ` irish ' is a fiction . 
  jfk 's ancestors moved to the usa 70 years before he was born . 
  he is not a product of ireland , he is not irish . 
  it 's so trashy how some radical irish fanatics think he 's got anything to do with them . 
  just because ` irishness ' becomes fashionable one day of the year in the usa does n't mean that irish people ` built america ' , as has been claimed in a previous post . 
  nothing in your post is relevant to what i 've said regarding the usa . 
  regardless , irish gdp per capita is heavily skewed by the presence of foreign companies in ireland . 
  it does n't reflect the true wealth of ireland , indeed gdp per capita is useless , unless you ** really ** believe that people in qatar are 2x as wealthy as irish people and almost 3x as wealthy as people in australia . 
  if you believe that irish people are over $ 25,000 better off than their british neighbours then you have no understanding of economics . 
  [ it 's much more useful to use scales such as median income for example , which gives a much more balanced assessment of wealth . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income )  the chinese are building new nuclear plants for you [ the uk is europe 's most attractive destination for foreign investment ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37216175 ) , and other countries envy the uk 's position in that sense . 
  it 's ideologically-driven exaggeration that was designed to discourage people from voting to leave the eu . 
  yes i 'd quite expect the eu to be put first , as negotiations have been ongoing with the eu already . 
  not to mention the eu is a larger economy and that the uk ca n't even begin trade arrangements until it 's fully outside the eu . 
  here 's a link to the article regarding the imf and 2017 recession : 18th june 2016 [ imf says brexit would trigger uk recession ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum )  the imf used its annual report on the british economy to say brexit would plunge the uk into recession next year and that it could see no economic advantage in leaving the eu . 
  this is out of date , part of the fear-mongering campaign before the referendum . 
  it 's full of untruths , like apparently the usa not being interested in a uk only trade deal , [ despite recent developments indicating otherwise ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/19/paul-ryan-london-visit-us-uk-trade-agreement-brexit ) . 
  this purported increase in wealth if the uk remained in the eu is meaningless when it would n't be shared by the majority of the population anyway . 
  regardless , this is based on the same sort of exaggerated claims of the imf which originally claimed the uk would go into recession in 2017 after the brexit vote , when now it forecasts the uk to grow at 2 % , faster than most other advanced economies . 
  fundamentally , brexit will have no meaningful impact one way or the other . 
  however , because of the anti-brexit campaign , many voted leave conceding that there * could * be some economic implications , because frankly we 're in such a situation that it 's worth losing some wealth to regain your own democracy , culture and jurisprudence . 
  the gravy train powers onward , powered by hot-air and european taxpayers . 
  ca n't stand this old fart . 
  tries to come across as an intellectual , but no academic would ever make such a ridiculous statement or tweet out the rubbish he does about reversing brexit or calling voters stupid . 
  if brexit is a coup , then he can leave and claim asylum somewhere in the continent ? 
  we 'll manage fine without him . 
   considering we basically built that country . 
  that 's a pretty bold claim considering hundreds of years of slavery in the usa . 
  irish people form a marginal percentage of the usa 's population , and those of irish ancestry still trail those of german ancestry in the usa for example . 
  regardless , by the time irish or german people for that matter moved to the usa en mass , the country was already on the path to becoming a superpower . 
  irish immigrants did n't build up america 's stock exchange wealth , did n't further its technological achievements , did n't take the geopolitical or domestically decisions that led to american ascendancy . 
  so many irish people try to lay claim to america 's successes and i find it so unjust to be honest . 
  the british public has been eurosceptic for decades . 
  the eu will collapse if its proponents ca n't accept the eu 's many failures and then reform , instead of just attributing eurosceptism to russian boogeymen . 
  the things you 've listed only have a limited impact on the uk . 
  we 're an island nation , and few people here regularly cross borders with eu states . 
  even in northern ireland it 's more of a special case because of the common travel area between the uk and roi . 
  the uk can still cooperate with european countries while outside of the european union . 
  cern and esa for example exist independently of the eu . 
   i think language diversity in europe has so far prevented anglosphere news tycoons like murdoch and hedge fund billionaires like mercer to subvert continental european opinion by populist tabloids or by covert manipulation . 
   that provides us with a defense or firewall against the most brutal manipulation of opinion in the us and the uk . 
  you 're right . 
  the eu is more or less perfect , and all british discontent towards the eu is manufactured by news barons fearful of the eu commission , which wisely and bravely refuses to be swayed by murdoch 's power and influence . 
  all 17 million brexit voters are too stupid to form opinions or do research of their own accord , and their reasons for voting ` leave ' have been entirely implanted by two or three newspapers , even in this age of universal internet access and the free-flow of information . 
  long live the eu !, 
  thank god i 'm not a poor , manipulated sheep and can think for myself . 
  if you 're talking about a * federal * europe and not just an eu that is slightly more integrated , the biggest problem is and always will be the difference in national wealth and economic structure . 
  for a federal eu to succeed , the eu would need to set up a ` transfer union ' , in which rich eu states like germany , france and others in the west transfer mass sums of money to poorer parts of europe in not only the east but increasingly in the south as well . 
  these would be much greater than eu development funds currently . 
  these type of payments are known as ` equalisation payments ' , and they 're already set up in nation states like the uk , by which for example the uk government transfers # 11 billion to northern ireland , # 14 billion to wales and # 15 billion to scotland via the barnett formula . 
  this is english money being spent in the rest of the uk . 
  no other uk country is a net contributor to the uk budget .
