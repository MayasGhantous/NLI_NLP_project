  they better have banned the obese as well , which is a much ` larger ' problem in the west at the moment . 
  what a load of crap , especially regarding those ' 1 million ' dead algerians . 
  it 's got nothing to do with brexit , are you only half-sentient ? 
  when the support for joining roi is so pitifully low , continued badgering for a united ireland from radical political parties amounts to calling for annexation . 
  you 're right , it 's not about money . 
  it 's about the disease of nationalism , and the irish nationalists who , despite having a country of their own already , want to expand their borders to meet those of an imagined , mythical time when the entire island of ireland was a single state and free of evil englishmen . 
  it must hurt to know that in reality ireland has only ever been united under english and subsequently british rule , and that , as the act of union is still enforce there , that northern ireland is the continuation of all previous incarnations of ireland . 
  you can see how deep your obsession is in the way that you 'd force hard austerity on your fellow citizens just to fulfill your backwards , 12th century fantasy . 
   how much of that `` economy '' has to do with london being one of the biggest financial centres of the european union the european union and single market have only been around since 1993 , so the answer is ` not much ' . 
  / u/xbettel / u/ltlabcoat / u/finndacool there wo n't be a referendum because there 's no call for it . 
  seats in the northern irish assembly do not adequately represent the views of the population . 
  the overwhelming majority do not support northern ireland being annexed into the republic . 
  [ border poll survey says 8/10 voters unchanged by brexit ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37309706 )  if such a poll is held , a clear majority of people , 63 % , say they will vote for northern ireland to remain in the uk , while only 22 % would support a united ireland . 
  ----------- and it 's not as though the republic of ireland can afford it . 
  public spending in n. ireland is # 20 billion , and tax only brings in # 9 billion . 
  [ the uk provides northern ireland with # 11 billion a year ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/top-expert-warns-northern-ireland-economy-is-facing-meltdown-28779242.html ) , a figure which amounts to 4.5 % of the republic of ireland 's gdp . 
  no one is going to vote to join a country where they 'll get less funding . 
  when will brexit actually ` happen ' ? 
  first we were told of economic devastation if we * voted * for brexit , then we were assured that the recession would happen after article 50 was triggered ... still no signs , and now what ? 
  we have to wait until a random day in 2019 to judge brexit the day after we leave officially ? 
  or do we then have to wait a year , 5 years ? 
  10 years ? 
  or however long it takes for a recession to occur ` naturally ' as part of the boom-bust cycle so that remainers can blame it on brexit ? 
  and really , brexit * is * happening right now . 
  markets and business react to future events , not the very present , and it 's been known that the uk is leaving the eu for over 10 months now . 
  for the markets , brexit is happening now , and there has been no downturn in investment or any indication of trouble of that kind . 
  i think the doomsayers have a bit of a wait on their hands , no matter how desperately they look for bad news .

   ** the imf used its annual report on the british economy to say brexit would plunge the uk into recession next year ** and that it could see no economic advantage in leaving the eu . 
  -- ** 18th april 2017 ** [ ` imf ratchets up uk economic growth forecast to 2 % ' ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/18/imf-ratchets-up-uk-economic-growth-forecast-to-2 )  the international monetary fund has revised up its uk growth forecast for the second time in three months after admitting that the performance of the economy since the brexit vote last year had been stronger than expected . 
   in its half-yearly world economic outlook , ** the imf said it now envisaged the british economy expanding by 2 % in 2017 -- making it the second fastest-growing advanced economy after the us . 
  the number of first-language speakers really does n't mean anything , especially at an eu level . 
  swedes are n't going to communicate to greeks in spanish . 
  [ english is the most spoken language in the eu , at 51 % , and the next most spoken is german at a distant 32 % . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_european_union#knowledge ), 
   as being old enough to have witnessed the ascendance of english english has been the dominant global language for well over 100 years . 
  even at the height of the spanish and french empires , spanish and french respectively were not spoken globally to the same extent that english was , even in the 1880s . 
  i never claimed to be without an ` agenda ' , which really as a * citizen * with only limited power over the policy of europe , really amounts to little more than a glorified * opinion * anyway . 
  my posts are comments on a social media chat group , not official political statements . 
  it 's a good thing i 'm not an elected representative or otherwise appointed politician bound to do what 's in the best interest of the people of europe . 
  any decision i make based on an ideology i might personally hold is n't going to decide whether a poor family in greece goes without food or whether a large chunk of the irish economy evaporates . 
  that of the european commission and parliament will however . 
  i 'm not enacting policy in the european union , so the ` validity ' , so to speak , of ` my ' agenda/opinion is n't relevant on a comparable scale to that of macron or other european politicians . 
  i do n't really mind if that 's what you think it is , because the merit of the argument i 'm making is n't based on whether it 's been copied and pasted . 
  i wrote it impromptu if you really care to know . 
  what macron means is that he 'll support the eu 's push for closer corporation tax rates . 
  he 's not just a french guy , he 's the likely incoming president of france , one of the eu 's most influential members . 
  at the moment ireland is good in the status quo that exists , but this is a direct warning that the status quo is ending . 
  tax harmonisation is n't a primary interest of france specifically , because there are a whole host of other eu countries that business could go to . 
  the policy is being pushed at an eu-level because it is a step towards european integration , not because it 's necessarily the right thing to do . 
  the eu is aware of what sort of impact this * could * have on ireland , but the prosperity of ireland comes second to the eu 's ideologically-driven agenda . 
  it 's questionable whether the eu should have any remit over corporation tax rates in member states at all . 
  ireland does have a large pharmaceutical industry , which accounts for 6.4 % of global pharmaceutical exports , but i would n't think that the industry almost practically alone is enough to sustain their economy . 
  the eu will always be helmed by those with an unwavering , orthodox view of european integration . 
  it 's an ideology so closely held , that eu mandarins have readily accepted the loss of one of the eu 's strongest and most dynamic members , rather than concede to any deviation of eu doctrine . 
  of course , this is n't the first time that eu statesmen have blindingly pursued their own personal , ideological agendas , rather than do what 's right by europe proper and its people . 
  the greek situation , for example , has been purposely used to set a precedent for aggressive intervention in the domestic fiscal policy of member states . 
  that the eu can get away with such behaviour towards greece , which has the 10th largest population out of 28 members , and inflict gruelling unemployment and poverty on its people , is alarming to say the least . 
  if the eu was n't seething with ideologues , then a multi-currency eu would be embraced . 
  greece , along with the rest of southern europe , would regain control over economic policy , and by setting their own financial parameters could make their economies competitive again . 
  eu ideology however prevents this , and as consequence is the source of the continued austerity , brain-drain and discontent bubbling away in much of southern europe today . 
  so , we arrive at the crux of the matter . 
  if the eu will stand idly by , ideologically undeterred , while nearly 10 years on from the start of the financial crisis the [ greek unemployment rate sits at 23.5 % , and greek * youth * unemployment rate is at 48.0 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics ) , then it 's almost certain that the eu will again push through policy harmful to its member states without questioning the negative impact . 
  the time 's up for ireland in this regard - if not now then within 10 years as the eu tries to solve its inadequacies with deeper and deeper integration and uniformity . 
  every eu member will have to face the choice between continued eu membership or maintaining tangible sovereignty . 
  when a uniform tax policy is pushed on ireland , and its leaders are powerless to prevent the negative economic impact on the country ... how will people be able to argue that ireland has remained sovereign ? 
  vetoes do n't mean anything in the long-term . 
  the eu has continuously shed unanimous decision-making for ` qualified majority voting ' at every stage of its development . 
  is ireland 's membership of the eu really that secure in the face of this uncertain future ? 
  the costs and benefits of eu membership are unique to each member state . 
  the balance of the two are shifting however . 
  for how much longer will poland and hungary still require eu development funds ? 
  i ca n't see poles remaining in the eu when it 's no longer useful to them . 
  other countries are rapidly becoming net contributors to the project . 
  ireland is now a contributor to the eu budget , and spain is on course to join them in a couple of years . 
  support for the eu is being challenged everywhere , and rather than adapt or evolve the union , by abandoning failed policies such as the euro and of freedom of movement , the eu fanatics would rather the bloc turn inward or even fracture entirely , so long as * their * fraction remains orthodox to the unnecessary concept of european * political * union , as imagined in the long-gone 1950s . 
  [ according to the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37309706 ) , 8/10 voters have not changed their view of a united ireland since the brexit vote , with northern irish support for union with the republic of ireland polling at just 22 % . 
  i personally do n't think eu membership is important enough to most remainers for them to opt for radical constitutional changes or to join a different country . 
  44 % of votes in northern ireland were to leave the eu and almost 40 % in scotland . 
  if a lot more scottish and n. irish votes had been for ` remain ' then the ` leave ' vote would n't have had won in the uk as a whole . 
  it 's a media-driven falsehood that brexit is something with only widespread support in england and wales . 
   i mean ive got an 88 year old grandma who wont eat foreign food [ is this your nan ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhf9xzfbq_e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m48s ), 
   degeneracy i discovered a while ago that a lot of mainland europeans are very uncomfortable around that word . 
  but still , how else can you describe things like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/k1xg7lyuyus?t=8m26s ) compared to traditional , [ real examples of european culture ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obyvmnmfmta ), 
  yep , you 're absolutely right . 
  i do actually have dyslexia , so i shall conveniently blame my mistake on that !, 
  good job spotting it !, 
  it 's to do with the hierarchy of the monarchy . 
  there 's a difference between being a ` queen * regent * ' and a ` queen * consort * ' . 
  when elizabeth ii 's father was the king , his wife was generally referred to as ` queen ' , but she was officially queen consort . 
  the distinction did n't need to be continually emphasised because the king obviously outranked her by being of the reigning lineage . 
  children would learn this at school so it was common knowledge . 
  when elizabeth ii ascended the throne , she became queen regent , and though the term ` king consort ' does exist , it 's rarely used because colloquially referring to the ` king and queen ' would infer that the queen 's husband is ranked above her , which he obviously is n't . 
  ` king ' as a term sort of ranks higher because of the now-abolished but traditional role of male primogeniture , by which first-born males inherit the throne . 
  the term ` king ' is really only used in the uk to refer to a king regent . 
  king consorts take on the title prince instead to prevent any confusion or misunderstanding . 
  it 's expected that when william becomes king , his wife kate will become ` queen catherine ' , officially titled the queen consort . 
  edit : all instances of ` regent ' should be ` regnant ' , sorry !,
