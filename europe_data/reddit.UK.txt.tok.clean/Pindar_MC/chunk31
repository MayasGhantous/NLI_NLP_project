  well the republic of ireland 's score is almost identical to the uk 's so ireland must be quite racist too , in which case i 'll say to you `` those in glass houses should n't throw stones '' . 
  not like how some of mainland europe is , no . 
  the uk does have problems with race , like * all * countries , very much including ireland . 
  when ethnic minorities do try and integrate in british society however they are accepted without question , which is why so many famous faces in the uk are actually of an ethnic minority background . 
  there are plenty to pick from , from the more internationally known , such as idris elba to the more domestically-known lenny henry . 
  if you compare something like ukip ( often accused of racism ) to some of the actually quite scary groups in mainland europe then you 'll realise the distinction . 
  even the ` english defence league ' are n't quite like ` golden dawn ' in greece for example , a country does n't even rank that poorly in this map compared to eastern europe . 
   ** a search for `` eurovision brexit '' yields half a million results , but british viewers need not worry -- it only means that the u.k. is as clueless about this aspect of leaving the bloc as it is about everything else ** . 
  the european broadcasting union is a completely separate organization from the eu , and as long as the bbc remains a member , the country can keep competing . 
  given that australia is competing for the third time this year , geography is certainly no barrier . 
  what a pathetically spiteful and poorly-directed little dig . 
  hardly surprising , she 's written for the guardian before too . 
  i keep re-reading the section in bold and it does n't even make any sense . 
  she has n't explained why it means the uk is ` clueless ' , it 's just a incomprehensible jab . 
  i 'd be quite pleased with leaving eurovision , anyway . 
  british artists dominate the international music industry , and if eurovision was on anyone 's radar in the uk and we sent a real contestant we 'd win every year . 
  some european countries send their best singers while we send failed x-factor contestants . 
  the whole of eurovision is a bit of a freak show , really . 
  bearded women and dancing russian grannies just like a circus . 
  [  the bpi , the trade body which represents the nation 's record labels , can reveal that british artists accounted for an impressive 13.7 per cent share of global music album sales in 2014 -- or just over 1 in every 7 albums purchased around the world . 
  ] ( https://www.bpi.co.uk/home/british-artists-score-highest-recorded-share-of-global-music-sales.aspx ) [  according to the global recording artist top 10 chart compiled by international music body ifpi , which reflects an artist 's popularity across albums and singles for their full catalogue , half of the 10 most popular recording artists in 2015 hailed from the uk , including adele in top spot ] ( https://www.bpi.co.uk/home/british-artists-dominate-global-music-sales-in-2015.aspx ) [  in 2015 , british artists accounted for more than one in six of artist albums purchased in the u.s. and one in five in canada . 
  that equates to a record 17.6 percent share of the u.s. artist albums market -- up from 12.2 percent in 2014 . 
  bpi only began its annual survey in 2003 , although it estimates that brits ' share of the u.s. market is now at a record high , even surpassing the beatles-led invasion of the 1960s .

  some newspapers , like the sun , may use selective reporting and have misled the public at times , but if it reports on eu migrants forming a significant chunk of the manufacturing workforce for example , that is n't an outright lie or falsehood . 
  what you can only say is that the paper is guilty of dramatising the event and making it seem more consequential than it may really be . 
  when the tabloids reported on the eu migrant crisis or bailouts - they were not fabricated stories . 
  the papers are guilty of exaggeration and dramatisation , but not of outright lying in regards to most of the news about the eu or eu migrants . 
  if * actually * you want to understand brexit , then take a look at this immigration chart from the bbc a couple of days ago in [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39717751 ) . 
  it 's more useful to use this [ direct link to the chart here . 
  ] ( https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/fd4b/production/_95834846_migration-v2.png ) the spike in migrants from all countries has led to tension in british society , but the scale of eastern european migration has been very noticeable because it is n't only concentrated in only the biggest cities . 
  therefore when you read on the bbc that [ eu migrants now make up 11 % of the manufacturing workforce ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39576112 ) , the people who 've lost their jobs or ca n't find one are far less likely to live in london or the [ home counties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_counties ) . 
  the people affected by eu migration the most are disproportionately those in the remaining industrial towns and cities , even if in gross terms there are more eu migrants in london for example . 
  eu migration is heavily focused in england and increasingly in south wales , which also accounts for the leave voting being about 10-15 % higher in england and wales than in scotland and northern ireland . 
  ca n't neglect to mention that as a rule , eastern eu migrants tend to be less skilled than from other places , so they take other working-class jobs in services like in hotels and restaurants and sales in shops . 
  this explains why working-class people feel the burden of eu migration disproportionately . 
  working class people vote for brexit because they 're stupid or intolerant , but because they 're the ones experiencing the hardship in terms of employment , let alone school places and doctor 's services and yes crime , which are all exacerbated by certain eu migration . 
  skilled eu migration to london does n't fund the problems exacerbated by unskilled eu migration in northern england . 
  blaming the tabloids only removes blame from the eu 's ideology . 
  yes , tony blair is responsible for placing no temporary restrictions on eastern european migrants in 2004 , but even if blair had done then eurosceptism would have only increased in the 2020s rather than 2010s . 
  non-eu migration is a different kettle of fish , but it 's no surprise that so many people voted to leave with the aim of limiting whatever immigration they could . 
  for many , eu membership is synonymous with unchecked eu migration , and they voted accordingly . 
  we did n't have an option to vote on non-eu migration , but i imagine the results would turn out the same if we did . 
  freedom of movement is ridiculous between countries with such different standards of living . 
  short answer - three-fold increase in net immigration to the uk since the 1990s from [ an average of 104,000 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/25/race.world ) a year to [ 336,000 a year in 2015 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34931725 ) has produced real concerns that have not been stoked by the limited scope of the right-wing british tabloids , but is in fact the result of tangible drawbacks relating to jobs , school places , crime , the nhs , let alone otherwise unmentioned aspects of life such as culture and society . 
  there are benefits to immigration and no one wants it to completely end but a great many deal of us want levels to return to that of the 1990s . 
  ending freedom of movement with the eu gives the british people the ability to influence our own government to reduce immigration , or at the very least ` filter ' it to reduce unskilled immigration which is actually blighting and dividing british society . 
  i do n't think you realise what a large sum it is . 
  regardless of whether it 's just a ` starting ' price , it 's what the eu has asked for . 
  the cost is so colossal that even getting half of it back is unacceptable . 
  10 % of that cost is n't acceptable . 
  importantly , the uk will never provide it as an upfront payment in any situation . 
  the cost of the uk 's two new supercarriers is $ 7.3 billion . 
  the uk 's nuclear weapons system only costs $ 2.8 billion a year . 
  the * entire * eu budget in 2014 was $ 143 billion . 
  the uk will * never * accept any sort of fee of this scale . 
  it 's 4 % of the uk 's entire annual gdp . 
  it 's 46 % of ireland 's annual gdp . 
  the uk is n't paying what would effectively be war reparations . 
  the british people wo n't accept it and wo n't tolerate any government that does either . 
  it really would lead to a total unraveling of uk-eu cooperation , and that includes military and intelligence sharing , which is the uk 's strongest hand here . 
  ultimately in this scenario the uk would default to wto terms and the eu will have to try and explain to eu member states like the netherlands , france , belgium and ireland why it 's cut off access to one of their most important markets . 
  ca n't see the eu remaining unscathed from the fallout . 
  happy to discuss it if you 'll respond with a decent comment instead . 
  london is supposed to be the centre of * british * culture , history and society . 
  it looks british in almost every way , yet in reality it 's become a completely different country . 
  so much of the country 's heritage cut off from the rest of us because of mass migration , which has destroyed any sense of community or shared experience . 
  it 's like london 's become the capital city of the * world * instead of the uk . 
  what 's most sobering is the * pace * of change . 
  this [ independent article from 1995 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/london-europes-new-ethnic-melting-pot-1525506.html ) puts the ethnic minority population of london at 20 % in 1991 , forecast to be 28 % in 2006 . 
  in 2015 [ according to the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21511904 ) , the ethnic ` minority ' population of london is now * 55 % * , with white brits making up just 45 % of the population . 
  these migrants fail to adopt british culture and their descendants tend to reject it , which you can see in many ways . 
  now , british culture is by no means defined by the * last night of the proms * where they sing a few patriotic songs , but nonetheless it 's a celebration of britishness which attracts people from all over the country and indeed the world . 
  now i ask you to [ watch this short video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc8quqayyjc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=12s ) and ask yourself - why , in this public celebration taking place in the * very centre * of one of the most diverse cities in europe , are there practically no non-white people in either the hall or the throngs of people outside in hyde park ? 
  there 's not exactly anything wrong with a mutli-ethnic society . 
  but i think a mutli - * cultural * one is fundamentally wrong , and you can infer from even this inconsiquential video among other examples that many migrants and their descendants do not hold a british identity or are culturally british . 
  british culture should be dominant in the uk , including london , and it 's becoming increasingly clear that only a fraction of ethnic minorities are adopting these values , some more successfully than others i might add though . 
  now , perhaps * some * people can justify that in some bizarre way by lamenting the wrongs of the british empire and the colonisation of other parts of the world ( conveniently ignoring the hundreds of thousands of brits who left india and africa when british rule ended ) . 
  maybe london should embrace being ` capital of the world ' , sure . 
  maybe it makes sense that so many people of the former empire are here as commonwealth citizens and their descendants . 
  but tell me , how can anyone justify the same process happening * all over * western europe , even in countries that have practically no overseas colonial history or an incredibly limited one , like sweden ? 
  keep in mind the 1991 figure of the ethnic minority population in london being 20 % and its present condition . 
  all stats from wikipedia : 43 % of malmo is ethnic minority , with 31 % born overseas . 
  27 % of stockholm is ethnic minority 36 % of brussels is of non-european origin might be a bit of a stretch to include amsterdam , but it still has a population non-european in origin of around 33 % . 
  50 % of the city 's children are non-european . 
  in antwerp ' 39 % of the inhabitants of antwerp had a migrant background . 
  a study projects that in 2020 , 55 % of the population will be of migrant background . 
  ' , these are just a few cities in countries with limited colonial histories . 
  why are these cities destined to be like london in just 15-20 years ? 
  why is it a * good * thing that every european city should become so ` diverse ' that they all look the same ? 
  why should every mainland north western european city have an outpost of moroccans ? 
  most importantly , how is mass migration an * enhancement * . 
  it may not be a diminution , but why is it an * enhancement * , why is having more of the ` native ' population a bad thing somehow ? 
  how can anyone even talk of european integration when so many european countries are socially disintegrating from within . 
  if someone in the uk is visiting friends or family in sweden , then it 's nothing to do with european integration . 
  it 's now much more likely that they 're both somalian migrants . 
  how many germans visiting their family in the netherlands are actually moroccans ? 
  it 's laughable . 
  i 'm trying to engage with this as carefully and elegantly as i can but it really concerns me . 
  it 's nothing about race .
