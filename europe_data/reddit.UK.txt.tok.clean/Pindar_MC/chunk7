  i have irish grandparents on one side of my family , i was born in england , i am english . 
   ** barack obama is also of irish descent ** l0l !, 
  l0l !, 
  l0l !, 
  no more than everyone in the world is of ` african descent ' if you believe the ` out of africa ' model , but yeah you keep dreaming that a indonesian-kenyan african is irish . 
  keep smoking those four leaf clovers . 
  there 's other issues they ca n't make their mind up on either , like whether oil is the driver of scotland 's economy which england has exploited , or whether it 's just a ` bonus ' . 
  [ turns out the scottish oil industry ca n't even support itself . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/scotland-north-sea-oil-97-per-cent-148bn-budget-deficit-scottish-independence-nicola-sturgeon-a7207756.html ), 
  nope . 
  turkey and azerbaijan are not in europe , never will be . 
  i find myself of the opinion that this is a discussion in which all of us can participate , but i 'm afraid you 'll have to do more than just insult me , even if it is almost 4am . 
  speaking of which , should n't you be getting your fishing boat ready ? 
  you 'll miss all the best spots my good * man * . 
  yeah , it 's a good idea for scotland to leave a united kingdom where its people receive an extra # 1,600 more per person in public spending than people in england do via the [ barnett formula ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/1580787/how-the-barnett-formula-works.html ) which transfers great amounts of wealth from england to scotland to prop up unsustainable health and social programs , so that it can join a european union where it will likely have to be a net contributor to the eu budget and fund the development of even poorer regions . 
  scotland should get out of the uk because it 's economy is doing great !, 
  why , it 's [ growing a full 1/3rd of the rate ] ( http://www.gov.scot/topics/statistics/browse/economy/pubgdp/gdp2016q3 ) of the [ rest of the uk 's ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38413787 ) . 
  naturally , scotland should leave the uk to join the eu , which as a new member will be force to adopt the disaster that is the euro and join the schengen zone , closing off the border with the rest of the uk where scotland [ does over 4x as much trade with than with the rest of the eu combined ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-uk-continues-to-be-scotlands-largest-market-for-trade ) . 
  plonker . 
  this is why you scots ca n't be trusted with another referendum , so many of you are blind to the facts . 
  [ do n't worry , mother may has no intention of allowing another ref anytime soon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwzamxqfbok ) . 
  ireland ca n't have produced that much greatness if it needs to claim the * american * president kennedy for itself . 
  i suppose if that 's valid then the uk can claim everything that most other us presidents have achieved , not to mention practically everything ever done by any australians , canadians and new zealanders . 
  anyway , if i were from a country remaining within the eu i 'd be concerned about ireland deciding to go build up more debt for itself . 
  [ next time there 's an economic crisis the uk wo n't be around to bail ireland out . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9813358/british-taxpayers-funded-irelands-14bn-bail-out.html )  together with the bank bail-outs , the uk taxpayer has propped up the irish economy with at least # 20bn , which will renew questions about how the labour government handled the bail-outs in 2008-09 . 
  incredibly unpopular idea but i for one am fed up with this namby pamby pussyfooting around turkey . 
  the country is a barbarous backwater . 
  the west should instigate a coup in turkey and install a western puppet . 
  if things go wrong sort things out with hard military action . 
  it 's easy to remember the few situations where such attempts have failed such as in iran , but it worked for the rest of the middle east and all of south america during the last century . 
  turkey is already attempting to hold europe to ransom with this migrant crisis and open jihadi network . 
  it needs to be utterly smashed before the country becomes increasingly assertive . 
  if it collapses into civil war like syria then just occupy thrace and blockade the bosphorus and let them kill each other . 
  europe needs to be aggressive if it wants to survive . 
  there 's a form of quality of life which ca n't be measured by economic statistics , like hearing your own language spoken around you and not feeling like a stranger in your own country . 
  regardless , the uk has recovered from that era because of the ` big bang ' of london 's financial sector from the 1980s and from the initial boost of north sea oil . 
  that 's because the snp does n't have an ideology other than independence , and they flow between radically incompatible policies whenever it suits them . 
  indeed how so many scots can fall for such nonsense is remarkable . 
  the snp merely pursue whatever policies run in contrast with those passed in westminster in order to create the illusion that somehow scotland is intrinsically different to the rest of the uk and therefore requires ` independence ' . 
  2009 - [ alex salmond : euro membership is a ` strong argument ' for independence ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/4143731/alex-salmond-euro-membership-is-a-strong-argument-for-independence.html )  alex salmond has predicted that abandoning the pound and joining the euro will be a vote winner in his battle for scottish independence . 
   the first minister said there is a strong argument for making the switch as the economic crisis causes sterling 's value to plummet . 
  mr salmond has previously insisted that an independent scotland would keep the pound but , chuckling to himself , told his catalan interviewer that `` sterling is sinking like a stone '' . 
  2012 - [ it 's scotland 's pound and we 're keeping it , says alex salmond ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/scotland-pound-independence-alex-salmond )  alex salmond has provoked a fresh battle over his plans for a scottish currency after independence by declaring `` it 's our pound and we 're keeping it '' . 
   the first minister gave the clearest indication yet that an independent scotland would use sterling even if a formal sterling zone were rejected by the uk government -- a controversial option known as dollarisation or the panama option . 
   `` united '' kingdom the majority of your fellow scots seem to think so . 
  cornwall 's great but it 's a * county * , not a country , and it 's not being marginalised against in anyway any more than people in kent or essex are . 
  the claims are a fabrication . 
  the economic and political union are far more recent developments , with the single market not completed until the 1990s and the eu itself only being around since 1993 . 
  you can even argue that the eu in it 's current form has only been around since 2009 after the ratification of the treaty of lisbon , as such it has had no impact on the post-war prosperity of europe . 
  not really , as the issues are n't even comparable , it 's like comparing a splinter to multiple organ failure . 
  about 2000 people speak cornish , and a lack of funding for the dead tongue merits no comment from a non-domestic institution which the purpose of is `` to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress . '', 
  never mind the convention on action against trafficking in human beings , european convention on human rights , european committee for the prevention of torture and the the convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse , there 's someone out there in cornwall who does n't know the cornish word for pasty !, 
  you know nothing about my political views , and opposition to the eu comes from all quarters of the political spectrum , not merely those on the right . 
  indeed those on the left have been some of the eu 's harshest critics , like the late tony benn . 
  nato has been the vanguard of peace and prosperity in europe , with the ec and eu merely a sideshow which has revealed its incompetence at every opportunity , whether that be in the former yugoslavia or in regards to the migrant crisis . 
  oh pay attention please . 
  it 's an article titled `` the man who wants to unmake the west '' , and the topic is about this steven bannon character and his presumed goal of bringing about an end to the european union , thus indicating they are one in the same . 
  bizarre , unwarranted self-adulation from these radical advocates of european integration . 
  the ` european union ' is not what defines the west . 
  it 's almost sickening to suggest so , and for the eu to be lauded for the labour of the countries that have preceded it . 
  it reminds me of george orwell 's * 1984 * :  she believed , for instance , having learnt it at school , that the * party * had invented aeroplanes . 
  ( in his own schooldays , winston remembered , in the late fifties , it was only the helicopter that the party claimed to have invented ; a dozen years later , when julia was at school , it was already claiming the aeroplane ; one generation more , and it would be claiming the steam engine . ), 
  noticeably not by anyone in cornwall except one lunatic . 
  this is a smear by the council of europe , a defunct non-entity . 
  how about it focuses on something real like the abuse of homosexuals in russia , civil war in ukraine , dire poverty in greece and prevalent female genital mutilation in parts of turkey , all countries which are part of the council . 
  cornwall has a nationalist ` movement ' , * mebyon kernow * , capable of bringing up the issue * if * the people of cornwall desire it . 
  in all the constituencies of cornwall in the 2015 general election , mebyon kernow received at the highest just 4.1 % of the vote in st austell and newquay , but on average they received just 1.93 % of the vote . 
  in contrast , ukip for example received an average of 12.98 % of the vote .

  nothing more . 
  the uk opted out of the agreement because situations like those occurring now are indeed quite foreseeable . 
  20 years ago the threat was from the former soviet bloc and things such as weapons and people smuggling . 
  the only reason a crisis was avoided then was because of the rapid transfer of development funds . 
  cooperation and no borders are not the same thing . 
  mainland europeans have shown themselves incapable of maintaining a common border among themselves , we do n't want to have to deal with your mistakes . 
  yeah , just stereotype 17m people , more than the total population of greece . 
  maybe i should judge all greek people on a news report during the recession about an elderly greek woman who had to hunt garden snails for her dinner . 
  [ absolutely no idea ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/28/german-police-arrest-alleged-contact-christmas-market-killer/ ), 
  we brits love europe , but a great many of us hate the european union , which no matter how much you may desire is not and will never be one in the same with europe . 
  many people in northern ireland are descendant from brits , and scottish people in particular . 
  `` brits out '' is a call for ** ethnic cleansing ** and nothing can disguise that fact . 
  think of all the irish-nationalist , terrorist-supporting scum , so many of whom have died and continue to die every day without seeing a ` united ' ireland ... and then think about the many more still alive today who will still never see their vile , racist , irredentist dream come true ... 
  brings a smile to my face every time !, 
  except the nazi 's were n't the first to abolish and suppress the the slave trade , did n't end the ritualistic murder of widows in india ( sati ) , build the world 's first modern infrastructure , begin the industrial revolution , create the global economic system , introduce the first legislation limiting child labour , publish the first academic journals , and much much else , including things as banal and basic as breeding most of the world 's dogs and much creating the basic concept of a police force . 
  we do n't need propaganda to see the greatness of what britain has contributed to the world , it 's all around us . 
  so-called ` universal culture ' has its roots in british culture , and it 's all underpinned by concepts and characteristics still present in modern british culture , such as the british sense of ` fair play ' . 
  every country is the product of colonisation , it just is n't referred to that if it occurred outside of a certain time period . 
  china was n't just put there by divine intervention , the han chinese population expanded and displaced the minorities of the region now known as china , and the same is true of every country today . 
  ` native ' americans were not the first people in north america . 
  that is plain to see from even basic fossil records which show humanoid remains from thousands of years ago before the mongolian-descendant ` native ' americans colonised the region . 
  why then therefore do they have a greater right to live there than people who arrived in canada in 1840 ? 
  the positives of the british empire outweigh the negatives , which are all very much the product of their time period , not in any way spectacular , unexpected or more heinous than any event at any time in history . 
  frankly i find it bizarre how so many people can idealise ancient greece , china or rome and somehow turn a blind eye to true barbarity which occurred in those time periods . 
  when the xenophobic anglophobia in countries like kenya and ireland fades ( mostly harvested for political purposes ) , the british empire will be remember as one of the core proliferators and progenitors of modern , advanced civilisation . 
  it 's as though the nytimes is written in some sort of parallel universe . 
  its articles about brexit , the eu and the usa among others never makes a shred of sense or have concurrent stories reported elsewhere . 
  read the article for yourself . 
  essentially ... no one no where in any real position of power or influence has given serious thought about proposals for an eu nuclear deterrent , and instead an article has been whipped out of thin air and filled-in and ` sourced ' with semi-random donald trump-related comments and posturings from obscure pro-eu politicians . 
  france is held up as core to the proposal but there is not a single quote from a french politician in the article .
