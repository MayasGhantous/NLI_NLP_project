  i 've got direct patrilineal descent to a 10th century king of powys , [ ** elystan glodrydd ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elystan_glodrydd ) who claimed to be descended from [ ** macsen wledig ** aka * flavius magnus maximus augustus * , western roman emperor 383-388 ce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnus_maximus ) from during his time as commander of britain . 
  max himself was reputedly born in hispania gallaecia , of a roman family . 
  uk here . 
  try sainsbury 's - on their app it shows # 1.75 for a 150g `` unit '' . 
  i 've not seen them for a few years in aldi , lidl , asda or morrisons . 
  no idea about other chains . 
  as a 12-13 year old i read several books in my school 's library written by anthropologist sonia bleeker ( 1909-1971 ) . 
  at the time i found them hugely interesting , but had not appreciated that she had made first-hand observations by living amongst the groups of people she was writing about . 
  as a young adult before the age of the internet , i had some sense that the then us authorities had still not resolved many outstanding legal compensation claims . 
  occasionally i saw that movies were starting to portray native americans in a less stereotypical way . 
  most recently , as i 've started to expand my art knowledge , i 've begun learning about superb artists as diverse as : daphne odjig , maxine noel , jason carter , jerry whitehead , aaron paquette , tim nevaquaya , malcolm furlow , john nieto , norval morrisseau , leah dorian and others . 
  [ `` on the market '' ] ( https://www.onthemarket.com ) have got overseas listings ** on their main website ** if you scroll down . 
  but , as far as i can tell , their * app * only carries uk domestic content , which i suspect is because of memory issues and not wanting to fill up the cache on your mobile device . 
   braemar agree it 's nice there . 
  but ... hardly unknown . 
  it is on the main tourist route with regular coach tours calling as they visit royal deeside . 
  it is also a very famous location for an annual [ highland games gathering ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highland_games ), 
  in the uk we call it * elective home education * and there is a long-standing principle here that it is a matter for parents to identify how their children should educated . 
  as recently as 2009 there was a government-sponsored review of the topic , followed by a public consultation and proposals for some legislative changes . 
  [ here is a wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/badman_review ) about the badman review , which includes external links to various house of commons committee documentation . 
  the reign of stephen , king of england between 1135-1154 , a period known to historians as [ * the anarchy . 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_anarchy ) he usurped the throne from [ empress matilda , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empress_matilda ) who was stuck in normandy waiting to give birth . 
  the coffee shops i see throughout the uk are mostly the chains like starbucks , costa , caffe nero , coffee republic , etc. , which tend not to be designed to encourage long-stay visits . 
  this is part of the reason why author j.k.rowling 's exploits of writing her earliest * harry potter * manuscripts in coffee shops are so intriguing , as many of us struggle to imagine such tranquil places exist . 
  if you are already intent on visiting prague and budapest , i 'd suggest you are close enough that it should be fairly simple to add vienna to your schedule . 
  it was a massively important hub until the end of the austro-hungarian empire , and the city of beethoven and many other great minds , so there ought to be plenty to absorb . 
  there are vast numbers of castles from different eras scattered throughout europe , some originally fortresses and others more ceremonial in nature . 
  and you 'll almost inevitably encounter some along any route . 
  even if they are of only minimal interest , it might be beneficial to prepare yourself by some basic research of key features , which could help you capture a better variety of photos . 
  after all , you 'd probably be seriously frustrated if you 'd been just ten minutes away from somewhere like , say , neuschwanstein and then in years ahead everybody kept asking if you 'd visited it . 
  although there is also a much older custom of bonfires , pre-dating the addition of guy fawkes . 
  the pagan celtic festival of samhain has been morphed into halloween , but was not originally limited to just one night . 
  of course there was no gunpowder in earlier times , but the lighting of beacons was an important signal to neighbouring communities - and a handy part of land management in burning dead leaves etc, 
  i always had a hankering to learn semaphore , but could n't see that i 'd ever get chance to actually use it . 
  from tv news shown in uk it was a mixture of initial elation ( that it was happening ) and astonishment ( at the pace , with events unfolding more quickly than the infrastructure could cope ) . 
  lots of people seemed to be arriving from the old * east germany * into the former * west germany * . 
  there followed several months of concern that government agencies were facing tough challenges in trying to integrate people from different backgrounds , and worries expressed by some commentators that there was the potential for major community unrest if tensions built up through any sense of inactivity , unfairness or exploitation . 
  people eat those on the street , but still normally go into regular shops to buy them . 
  i interpreted the question as being linked to mobile traders with some kind of barrow or van , which turns up and gets plonked in the middle of pedestrianised streets , or outside sports stadiums on match days . 
  liverpool is twinned with birmingham , alabama , plus six other global cities . 
  the `` golden age '' of queen elizabeth i , during the late 1500s . 
  britain had defeated the spanish armada and had become undisputed in naval strength . 
  this was the period before the turmoil of the jacobeans and english civil war , a time when craftsmen and women flourished and skills were valued . 
  it was also a time where disputes were frequently resolved with fists or blades , and not gunpowder or civil litigation . 
  i can remember occasionally seeing events advertised , but do n't think it being world music day on 21 june has really gained widespread traction . 
  about twenty years ago the bbc had a live performance of some new composition , broadcast from the eastern coastline to coincide with sunrise , plus other pieces spread throughout the day . 
  another time one of the music conservatoires did something in an attempt at creating a new world record for most people playing a particular instrument type on the same song . 
  a few people i know have even scheduled a band reunion gig for the day . 
  personally i 'm happy enough with saint cecilia 's day on 22 november , even though i 'm not catholic . 
  the uk traditionally pauses for laying of wreaths and a minute 's silence , either at 11.00 on the day itself or on the nearest sunday , or both . 
  at anniversaries and certain other occasions the minute 's silence is sometimes extended to two minutes . 
  in 2018 the date itself occurs on a sunday . 
  most years there are various other remembrance activities which take place during surrounding days . 
  they are n't generally all given widespread publicity until nearer the time , when arrangements have been finalised and are in hand . 
   it was also about the tenth civil war in england ten . 
  really ? 
  i never studied history much , but do know bits and pieces about the war of the roses , the barons ' war , and the 2nd barons ' war - but what were the others please ? 
  are you perhaps elevating the status of some rebellions , skirmishes and uprisings not always viewed as `` wars '' , or are there bigger holes in my knowledge than i 'd previously thought ? 
  from a design standpoint , my top five would be : * new mexico * district of columbia * midway atoll * louisiana ( 1861-1912 ) * rhode island ( 1882-97 ), 
  in england most school pupils complete their general education with a range of general certificate of secondary education ( gcse ) examinations at age 16 , then will spend the next two years studying their chosen subjects at advanced level ( usually just called a levels ) . 
  universities individually set their own requirements for which a level subjects at what grades will be required in order to be considered for entry to specific courses . 
  mostly education is provided free of direct cost prior to the learners 19th birthday , although not all schools and colleges teach every subject - especially post-16 . 
  this means some learners might end up travelling further than they 'd prefer in order to access their chosen course , or having to compromise and study an alternative subject with their local provider . 
  this might happen across various topics , and can present particular hardship for example to learners in rural areas who only have one nearby school - such as if they want to study , let us say , languages but their school is recognised for its excellence in teaching sciences . 
  or if their preferred school is in a neighbouring county and lacks places due to being already heavily subscribed with locals . 
  dude was office manager who was very controlling about what tasks were allocated around the team . 
  one of the team members kept volunteering for extra stuff that he was n't qualified to tackle , then complained to senior management he was n't being given opportunities . 
  office manager got told to lighten up and develop people , so team member was let off leash . 
  various it systems suddenly got trashed by the inept team member , deleting programs he felt unnecessary and installing his own irrelevant junk . 
  when office manager said `` i warned you he was unsuitable '' he got into a barney with senior management , and they fired him . 
  then senior management gave the rubbish team member even more responsibility and it systems got worse , plus the guy was n't doing his own original tasks anymore either . 
  as a general rule of thumb , in the uk you might expect it to take six weeks . 
  that is mainly to give solicitors time to perform routine checks with land registry .
