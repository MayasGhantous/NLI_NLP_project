  all nato ever agreed to do was defend nato members . 
  why would nato do anything now ? 
  i do n't want to see british soldiers sent to die stopping russia in syria or ukraine because syria and ukraine are n't part of nato . 
  if russia marched into estonia that would change things significantly , because then russia * would * be attacking nato . 
  your entire conclusion seems to be `` nato wo n't attack russia for attacking non-nato members , there nato clearly wo n't attack russia if it attacks nato members ! '', 
  frankly , that 's moronic and has absolutely no basis in logic or fact . 
  well evidently russia does not currently share your certainty otherwise they probably would be using the `` ethnic russians '' card they 've been using in ukraine against the baltic states . 
  you ca n't really invade a country when the government of said country , however brutal and autocratic it is , invites you in . 
  also , syria is n't in nato , nor was ukraine , or georgia if you want to go that far back . 
  explain how these events mean nato is nothing but paper . 
  and you base this conclusion on russia staging an intervention in non-nato syria ( assad being a russian ally ) alongside iran ( another assad ally ) and hezbollah ( another assad ally ) ? 
  i ca n't see the logical connection here . 
  nato is n't bound by treaty to oppose russian actions in syria . 
  do you suspect nato would fall apart if russia invaded a member state ? 
  blatantly eurosceptic writer who openly declares his support to quit the eu finds the `` stay '' campaign lacking . 
  what a shock !, 
  why would n't we want other land ? 
  have you seen the british isles ? 
  the campaign to keep the uk in ca n't start because cameron has not concluded his negotiations . 
  it 's very hard to campaign on favour of conditions that are n't revealed yet . 
  the campaign to leave can start as it pleases because it does n't matter what cameron negotiates : the eurosceptics will wish to leave no matter what . 
  so ... this is some sort of in-joke ? 
  are there actually any sources of eu officials saying uk opt-outs are going to be renegotiated post-referendum , or is this just an outpouring of angst on your part ? 
  he 's on to us guys . 
  well , as long as they 're not deploying conscripts and only the contract soldiers , * i suppose * you could argue that counts as volunteering ... 
  ireland . 
  ireland . 
  we only have one neighbour . 
  in russia , that would be a low turnout !, 
  migrant crisis , i suppose ? 
  their constitution is clear on the issue , which is why madrid simply blocks these moves with legal action . 
  as per the spanish constitution , for catalonia to secede all of spain must agree to it . 
  the north of england was offered regional representation and voted overwhelmingly against it and on embarrassingly low turnout . 
  opinion polls were so against it elsewhere that only one of the planned referenda went ahead . 
  [ see here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_england_devolution_referendums,_2004 ) the rest of your post is spot on , though . 
  no amount of devolution will satisfy the snp . 
  that 's not to say scotland should n't get it if it votes for it and it is n't impractical , but do n't think it 'll ever make the independence calls go away . 
  * nothing * . 
  we had them mostly convinced that was just bants or tinfoil hattery until you went and confirmed it was actually true . 
  assumption , as opposed to slash stating `` scotland 's not going '' like it 's a fact , despite the facts stating the opposite . 
  for full disclosure i 'm also scottish , and voted remain . 
  i 'm unhappy we 're leaving , but like the majority of scots i do n't support the snp 's plan for an emergency `` quit the uk before the uk quits the eu '' referendum , and like the majority of scots the brexit vote has n't made me switch to supporting independence . 
  i agree the leave camp will be disappointed , i never made any argument otherwise . 
  i 'm pointing out you 're wrong about scotland : the scots are n't preparing to quit the uk . 
  most still want to stay in the uk , and most do n't support the idea of having an emergency independence referendum to get out of the uk before the uk gets out of the eu . 
  no , the snp have made a lot of noise about it but the snp are not scotland . 
  support for independence has n't gone up , support for a second referendum has n't gone up , and the last poll to break it down into `` when for a 2nd referendum ? '', 
  had a majority for the options that amounted to `` not until after brexit is done at least '' . 
  snp party broadcasts = / = actual scottish public opinion . 
  no current poll suggests anywhere near `` scotland will quit because of brexit '' . 
  well , yes : my post was entirely based on the assumption that the ruling is n't subsequently overturned . 
  if it is overturned , then obviously it wo n't delay a thing . 
   labour areas voted to stay in the eu by a massive majority . 
  care to source that one ? 
  comparison of [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/united_kingdom_eu_referendum_2016_area_results.svg ) [ two ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/2015ukelectionmap.svg ) maps does n't appear to show an apparent overlap . 
  or did you mean labour voters , rather than labour areas ? 
  labour voters as a whole did vote [ strongly remain ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/ ) , but the regions traditionally regarded as labour heartlands seemed to actually lean towards leave majorities . 
  i also hope parliament demands a plan but with the expected whipping i 'm not sure it 'll be as well-formed as we both hope . 
  this will delay but i do n't think it will * stop * brexit . 
  tories will whip it , corbyn is quietly pro-brexit anyway so he wo n't whip against it , leaving only really the snp and lib dems who 'll have a cohesive opposition to it . 
  what the fuck hungary . 
  the expense of conducting it , the disruption of conducting it , the need to focus civil service resources on working on brexit negotiations , not giving the eu a means to undermine the negotiations by playing scotland off against ruk . 
  by your logic we could hold a referendum every week . 
  you seem to believe they 're easily done - they 're not . 
  they 're massive exercises in logistics that consume a lot of time and resources . 
  we had one in 2014 and polls suggest scots do n't want another one , at the very least not until we 're out of the eu . 
  i ask you : why should we conduct one ? 
  the public do n't want it , so why ? 
  just because the snp say so ? 
  [ middle of last month ] ( http://www.panelbase.com/media/polls/sundaytimestablesforpublication150916.pdf ) and the last poll to actually ask the question . 
  32 % want a referendum before we leave the eu ( eg 2017-19 ) , 21 % after we 've left ( eg 2019-20 ) , ** 47 % ** do n't want one at all in the coming years . 
  nearly half of scots do n't see leaving the eu as a reason to call another referendum , and nearly 70 % do n't want to hold one in an attempt to become independent before the uk leaves the eu anyway . 
  the snp massively overstate their case because they want to drum up support . 
  leaving the eu is not the battlecry for a second referendum they claim it is . 
  that 's a huge assumption to make when even brexit has n't moved the polls in favour of independence . 
  catalonia 's unofficial referendum has n't succeeded in doing much either : support for independence there was higher in 2012 and 2013 than it 's been in 2015 and 2016 ( with the referendum being in 2014 ) . 
  the idea that refusing to agree to a second referendum 3 years after the first would cost the unionist side support is one without evidence . 
  in fact , here 's evidence to the contrary : by [ 50 % to 37 % ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/09/01/davidson-now-more-popular-sturgeon-scotland/ ) scots do n't even want another referendum at all . 
  from the same survey scottish independence comes in at * seventh * out of ten issues that people believe the government should focus on ( with only 11 % support ) , even our relationship with the eu comes third , comfortably behind economic growth and healthcare issues . 
  from the same poll , by 49 % to 23 % , scots believe that we 're better off economically within the uk . 
  the appetite for another referendum is not there . 
  the appetite for an actual independence vote is not there . 
  the belief that scotland is being harmed by being in the uk , even after a leave vote , is not there . 
  the snp overstate their case dramatically , because they want to drum up support . 
  [ only 37 % of scots support another referendum , with 50 % opposed and 13 % unsure ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/09/01/davidson-now-more-popular-sturgeon-scotland/ ) . 
  scotland does n't want yet another referendum : the snp do . 
  sturgeon may well want to demand one but theresa may has already said she wo n't support it . 
  without the uk government agreeing the best the snp could do ( and i recall there being arguments in the last referendum about whether they could even legally do this ) is hold an unofficial opinion poll that the unionist side would certainly boycott en masse - see the [ catalonia referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) for something similar . 
  it would result in a huge pro-independence vote with a turnout well below 50 % . 
  nothing would come of it . 
  sad times to be a british eu federalist , let me tell you . 
  the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , of course . 
  the * other * macedonia !, 
  bear in mind that in terms of gdp per capita , germany ( $ 41,000 ) and bulgaria ( $ 7,000 ) are very far apart . 
  bulgaria 's gdp per capita is 17 % of germany 's . 
  as such raw pay may seem very poor by german standards . 
  i could easily argue there 's a level of fearmongering in centrist/left wing views as well . 
  all to readily do i see people resorting to calling right wing viewpoints or people names : fascist , nazi , racist , xenophobe , misogynist ... 
  i think * both * the right and left wings are radicalised and intolerant , they simply direct that at different groups or causes . 
  the pull factor of the right is that they 're framing their own positions as acting in the defence of the common man , as standing up for the everyday person against faceless corporate and political elites who pursue their agenda at the expense of the local population .
