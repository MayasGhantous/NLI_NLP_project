  give 'em some time to recover and grow , they 'll pass you up eventually . 
  portugal is n't that rich and ukraine has a much larger population . 
  with the level of corruption and general bad shit in ukraine though , it may take a long time . 
  yeah , they 're still a bit conservative when it comes to things like homosexuality and whatnot , but i have no doubt most of the people there are decent . 
  it 's too bad , putin could be such a great leader with his take-no-shit approach , but he 's focusing on the wrong things . 
  russia needs a diversified economy , to shift money from the military towards education and to improve relations with the west , but he 's done the opposite . 
  russia is indeed ( sadly ) pretty pathetic compared to what it has the potential to be , with that huge workforce , giant land area and vast amount of natural resources . 
  even though they 're not exactly buddies with us , i 'd like to see them start reaching their potential . 
  maybe tomorrow , but not yet , it 's a fair bit of effort . 
  for now just imagine glorious motherland circle as second largest in europe , way ahead of uk and france . 
  gdp is n't perfect , but it is , at best , a useful indicator . 
  anyway , this comment is great : _____________________________ `` gdp = c + i + g + x - m the `` g '' is government spending . 
  the government could spend $ 1 billion on tanks , bombs and helicopters , which all have limited use-value outside military application . 
  national accounting statistics would count this as the dollar cost of the goods purchased , but this would only tell us what these goods would have earned in alternative lines of production , not the actual value of what government produced . 
  any type of government or consumption expenditure will add to gdp . 
  if i walk over to someone 's house and break their window , gdp goes up as they repair it . 
  inductively we can conclude that my action was beneficial since it increased aggregate spending . 
  however , the statistical aggregations would conceal the indirect and secondary effects . 
  had i not broken the window , they could have bought a computer which would have also boosted gdp by the same amount . 
  the data does n't tell us that the entire economy is now worse off because you have a window , but no computer when absent my action they would have had both . 
  we can only analyze economic outcomes when we understand the purposes of economic actors at a micro level . 
  sitting atop a tower high in the air and counting numbers will never tell you the purposes of the subjects and thus you will inevitably call wealth destruction `` good '' . '', 
  when is time for blanda upp .

  sources - wikipedia and [ knoema ] ( http://knoema.com/nwnfkne/world-gdp-ranking-2015-data-and-charts ) i know i 've posted a couple of these now , but the first one was just so bad that i had to do it again , and i do n't know how to edit posts . 
  this is the last one for nominal gdp ( until 2017 at least ) . 
  fixed the circle sizes and made it look a bit more snazzy . 
  took a while , but ay , accuracy is worth the effort . 
  and remember , do n't take gdp numbers too seriously , it 's living standards that matter , not the size of your economy . 
  i know it has 4x the population , but it 's so far from developed , i have a hard time believing it has the same economic output as countries like the uk and france . 
  the nominal gdp and ppp are just too far apart , clearly local prices are much lower , making ppp much higher , it does n't mean the output is higher than another nation with a lower ppp . 
  that 's why i do n't like using ppp to compare gdp . 
  according to ppp gdp , indonesia has a higher output than france . 
  seems just a little bit iffy . 
  i never said it has anything to do with how much people are earning . 
  a high gdp per capita generally means that the nation is developed and that the people have high living standards . 
  ppp just takes local prices and whatnot into account , so is better for comparing living standards than nominal . 
  oops , i just pulled an image of spain off of google and used trace bitmap , but i guess portugal has now been anschlussed . 
  too bad , i liked portugal too . 
  same thing with france , though honestly the pictures of the country are just eye candy , does n't matter * that * much if the shape is off a little bit . 
  i only included economies with a gdp over one trillion on this one . 
  i 'll do a more in-depth one later when i have more time . 
  because ppp takes into account local prices . 
  nominal gdp is pretty much just the gross output of the nation . 
  for example , a man in the uk earns $ 500 , a man in china earns $ 50 . 
  the man in china can buy 50 burgers for $ 1 each , but the british man can only buy 10 burgers for $ 5 each , because local prices are higher . 
  this means that in china , your purchasing power is higher when buying certain things . 
  * however * , if the chinese man wants to buy something like a japanese tv , he 'll have to pay $ 500 , the same as the british man or the american man . 
  prices do n't change when buying from another country . 
  even though he can buy more local products , international prices do n't change for the chinese man , so chinese ppp is higher than nominal . 
  that 's a pretty rough explanation , but i 'm tired and i honestly do n't know why i did n't just link a video or something . 
  sorry for fucking up the circle sizes , [ i made a new version with an accurate visual representation of the data ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/408u9s/european_countries_by_gdp/ ) to make up for it . 
  [ source one ] ( http://knoema.com/nwnfkne/world-gdp-ranking-2015-data-and-charts ) and [ two ] ( http://knoema.com/sijweyg/gdp-per-capita-ranking-2015-data-and-charts ) fixed from the other version , which had a crap circle area to gdp ratio . 
  this one has a way more accurate visualization of the sizes of economies and the difference in per capita income . 
  it 's probably comparing nominal gdps , which can seem a bit strange because currency fluctuations have a fairly large effect . 
  well , there is . 
  ppp is useful for comparing gdp per capita because it takes living standards into account . 
  nominal is better for comparing one country 's output to another . 
  spain 's economy grew , but because the currency fell it ca n't buy as much internationally , so the nominal gdp goes down . 
  it 's not * my * data , but it is accurate . 
  you have to remember fluctuation of the value of the euro against the dollar has an effect on gdp . 
  global standards as in compared to the world 's overall ppp per capita . 
  poland is richer than most south american countries , pretty much all african countries , a lot of asian countries and a lot of eastern european countries . 
  i 'm going to redo these eventually , with accurate circle area . 
  it 's not that i did n't care , just my way of turning gdp size into a circle was wonky as fuck . 
  i know how to spell germany , but since it has such a large gdp , i called it germoney . 
  ` tis a play on words . 
  wikipedia , but it seems knoema has a different number . 
  that 's 2014 info, 
  corrected myself with edit, 
  ah , fair enough . 
  i 'll keep that in mind next time , i might do gdp and gdp per capita again with accurate circle area relative to gdp . 
  the figures are all accurate , but the circle volume to gdp ratio is off . 
  the circle diameter to gdp is accurate though . 
  the uk , like poland , is listed once on the main map , and once in the comparison with a non-european country . 
  for gdp per capita ? 
  wikipedia , generally . 
  i know , wikipedia , never accurate blah blah , but for these figures they 're usually on point . 
  i also used [ this ] ( http://knoema.com/sijweyg/gdp-per-capita-ranking-2015-data-and-charts ) afterward , to make sure the figures were right . 
  being fair , at least the gdp numbers are right . 
  i could do it again with the right area for the circles , but i do n't have the file for this now . 
  edit - [ fixed it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/408u9s/european_countries_by_gdp/ ), 
  yeah , going by the volume of the circles it is n't too accurate , but at least the gdp values are right , which were supposed to be the main focus , but it looked boring with just numbers . 
  the circles were just supposed to be a nice visual aid , but it 's a bit counterproductive if they 're not to scale i suppose . 
  at a quick glance you can tell which economies are bigger , at least . 
  norway stronk , but of course at least one mistake managed to sneak past me . 
  i made russia 's ppp per capita circle twice as big as it should have been . 
  damn . 
  [ corrected version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ueo6wfr.png ) bear in mind , the circle volume to gdp ratio is a bit off . 
  circle diameter to gdp however is accurate . 
  had to redo it because people were ( rightfully ) complaining about the area of the circles not being the right size for the gdp , so [ here ya go , again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/408u9s/european_countries_by_gdp/ ) . 
  sorry for not putting you dutch on there , i 'll probably do another european map of gdp and gdp per capita but with accurate circles soon . 
  it is n't , it does n't have 2015 gdp from what i can see, 
  of course i 'd be using ppp for comparing gdp per capita, 
  yah , was making this while tabbing in and out of arma . 
  i have an excuse for mislabeling austria , but greece i just forgot . _ . 
  i can make a gdp per capita one later , this time i 'll put austria in the right place,
