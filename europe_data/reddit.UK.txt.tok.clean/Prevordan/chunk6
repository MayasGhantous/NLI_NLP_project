  i never said if it was a nation or not . 
  wikipedia says it 's just a region of belgium , not a country , but i 'll take your word for it . 
  so flanders is n't part of a country , it 's just its own country ? 
  am i to assume then , that since i 'm from manchester , i 'm not british , i 'm mancunian ? 
  i think you need to reread my comment , silly swede . 
  just ignore him , he 's dutch . 
  or belgian . 
  i ca n't remember which flanders is . 
  looks a bit damp , just wear some wellies and you 'll be sorted . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a good decision to live in an autocratic country or that i support autocratic countries . 
  i 'm saying if somebody does n't like a country and is n't willing to change , then them going somewhere where they feel like they belong is a good idea . 
  i never said i support autocratic fucking regimes . 
  i 'm not applying it to a specific group of people from one country , i 'm talking about all immigrants/refugees that do n't fit in with the new host country . 
  how are you having trouble wrapping your head around this , you 're writing in flawless english so you can clearly understand me . 
  are you just stupid ? 
  so from me saying that people going to where they feel belong is good , you think i 'm fine with autocratic regimes in other countries . 
  `` i do n't know exactly . 
  but i will go back to a society that 's a better fit for me . '', 
  why ca n't more refugees/immigrants be like this , instead of trying to change the society they joined ? 
  a little bit misleading , but if twisting it makes you happy then fine . 
  we were running out of super high precision laser guided bombs . 
  that 's it . 
  that does n't mean we ca n't wage war anymore independently . 
  if you think the uk or france are incapable of waging an offensive war just because a couple media outlets said they had too small a stockpile of high precision bombs in 2011 , you 're an idiot . 
  france or the uk would utterly annihilate libya in a war . 
  the uk had 45,000 troops , over 100 jets and thousands of vehicles in iraq , and that was n't going all out . 
  france could have done the same if it wanted . 
  and from the comments : _______________________ `` wrong , the intelligence here is totally incorrect / misleading . 
  well , no source nor figure is actually indicated so no wonder . 
  for example , for france , the level of ammunitions available is public : - cruise missiles ( ` scalp ' ) : stockpile : 500 ; used in lybia : 12 - precision missiles ( ` aasm ' ) : 3 248 ; used : less than 300 - of/wich laser guided : 1 200 ; used : less than 100 - other less precision air to ground ammo ( ` gbu ' ) : tens of thousands - aircraft engaged : 30 ; aircraft available at any time : 320 . 
  - the list goes on ... 
  source : 14 april , french parliament mandatory reports on military activities outside borders . '', 
  i 'm not saying neutrality , i 'm saying we should think things through a tad more before acting . 
  hopefully in a decade this 'll be over and the eu and us will be friendly with russia . 
  yeah , or we could stop being antagonistic assholes to russia and stop randomly bombing in syria , then no one would have any reason to even think of attacking us . 
   while receiving a tiny fraction of the effectiveness the us would receive for the same amount of money . 
  unless you have a source for that info , shut the fuck up . 
  you think the uk would be irrelevant but not brazil ? 
  you 're off your fucking tits . 
  we 'd be fine outside of the eu , who gives a fuck if we 're not as relevant as the us or china . 
  we do n't need to be . 
  why the dislikes ? 
  i thought everyone wanted normal muslims to show that they 're with us not against us ? 
  oi , the us started as the thirteen colonies that belonged to the british empire . 
  the fuck you think you 're doing being sovereign and shit ? 
  get your asses back to the eastern seaboard and give us money . 
  if you 're quiet we 'll forget the last 300 years of insubordination . 
  i did n't vote ukip and i 'm not christian . 
  i just think people like you complete asshats because you do n't understand that our country ca n't handle too many people coming in . 
  some refugees are fine , but as high as immigration is , services and infrastructure ca n't keep up . 
  what we should do is fix the problem over there while giving refugees * temporary * shelter . 
  but of course , instead we 're bombing them like everyone else . 
  there 's such a thing as being living within your means , we ca n't let every desperate person inside . 
  we already have our own fuckin ' homeless , but nobody helps them . 
  i 'm not saying he 's a good leader , i 'm just thankful he 's doing that instead of letting hundreds of thousands of them in , we the people do n't want it . 
  we did n't choose the bombing though . 
  that just shows how much of a twat he is . 
  when people have negative opinions of them, 
  here in the uk , going to university changed pretty much nothing for me . 
  big internationally recognized universities are common here like in the states , so there were a lot of local choices . 
  britain being really small helps too , not much travel no matter where you go . 
  even if you live in a small village , a large city is always within 100 km or so . 
  americans tend to be more outgoing and independent than europeans , leaving their hometown behind to move to a bigger city . 
  i do n't see much of that in the uk , mostly because they can stay in their hometown and just travel to the city they work or study in easily every day . 
  i go to university but i still live with my family , i feel like almost nothing changed from college ( high school for you guys i guess ) . 
  my best friend is a guy i met in elementary school , so i guess `` it would seem that you develop stronger relationships with friends because you 're around them a lot longer '' is true , in my case at least . 
  have a good christmas , friendly yank . 
  being fair , it 's merkel that wanted the refugees in , not the average german , some german people are just being accommodating . 
  as for the israel weapons thing , that 's not the average german person doing that , that 's sketchy politicians . 
  well , i like the german people . 
  they 've atoned for what they 've done and even the generations who never committed the crimes felt guilty and apologetic over what happened . 
  germans are n't any different from us , they just want continued prosperity and peace . 
  it 's their leader i ca n't stand , merkel is fucking disgusting , bullying greece and forcing everyone to take refugees . 
  her approval ratings have plummeted to like -6 % . 
  even the germans are sick of her . 
  she makes me thankful that we have david cameron instead of her , and i do n't like cameron * at all * , but at least he is n't letting almost a million refugees into our country and europe like merkel . 
  as for the downvotes , did n't realize there were so many pc lefty cunts who love massive influxes of refugees and do n't think germany has redeemed itself for what it did . 
  i meant the eu as a whole , but the uk and france are n't militarized and aggressive relative to their old selves . 
  if they were they 'd each have military budgets three as big and russia 's and each have control over half of africa again . 
  france and britain are scary when they 're serious about war , germany too . 
  china seems to love europe and hate america . 
  i see pakistan hates our leader , strange then that they keep moving over here . 
   and a british taxpayer i find this most amusing, 
  scotland would n't * fall * , it 'd just be worse off , massively more so in the short term , for which reasons i 've already told you . 
  ____________________________  no we did not join willingly , typically class pig ignorant comment . 
  do you not know your own history ? 
  the scots fucked themselves over trying to become a world power by establishing a colony , which obviously failed . 
  the high-class scots wanted scotland to be a world power , and thought a union with england would be the only way . 
  they also thought it would help recover from their own attempt at being a world power through the darien scheme . 
  if scotland had n't royally fucked their own economy in the darien scheme , it would 've resisted union a lot more . 
  as for the normal scots , normal people never had any say back then anyway , same with the english . 
  and the alien act ? 
  it was n't passed out of nowhere . 
  england passed the act of settlement which pissed scotland off , scotland passed the act of security which pissed england off , and finally england passed the alien act to pressure scotland into a union which the scottish nobility already wanted , which is why it happened only two years later . 
  ________________________________  if english mps want something they can vote for it - any areas , we have a few token areas of autonomy as long as the english permit it `` as long as the english permit it '' - i remember when a scot was the leader of the uk not too long ago . 
  he was fucking useless . 
  but i can see you 're one of those `` muh freedum , tha english are tha source of all mae prublems '' scots . 
  no point in arguing with an idiotic cretin like you , then . 
   why do you care ? 
  because it 's one of the most successful unions of all time and breaking it would be retarded .
