he looks terribly upset, 
  im guessing italy 's blip in the 1800s is the wars of unification, 
  and those farmers are now asking the eu to keep sending them money . 
  this looks like a f * cking buzzfeed `` article '', 
  yeah cause your last two attempts went so well, 
  even if we take that logic , honor killings were common in china up til the end of the qing dynasty, 
  em excuse me , australia is in the [ northeast of russia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/esc_2017_map.svg ), 
  oh sorry i misread : /, 
  i think you 're mixing up milan and turin, 
  it isnt talking about the round ups in the occupation zone but in the south of the country , where the civilian vichy government ( who claimed to be the french state ) carried out the nazis orders without question . 
  the apple does n't fall far from the tree, 
   even the tiniest bit of effort would be noticed . 
  [ really ? 
  i have literally no idea what your on about, 
  you 're assuming these people actually go outside, 
  `` soros ' ghost is to blame for economic hardships , says hungarian president '', 
  you should probably look at the third image, 
  police , security sevices , etc, 
   now people say that if we are afraid the terrorists win , it 's like saying if you try to remove the knife that stabbed you the knife will win because you gave it the undeserving attention . 
  an excelent example , if you panic and try to remove the knife you 're almost guaranteed to do more harm to yourself than if you 'd just left it in and let a professional deal with it . 
  iceland of course, 
  its not ridiculous , it literally from islamist playbooks, 
  what is popular is not always what is right, 
  yeah i agree but then these people try to act like every single muslim state is exactly like isis , when in reality quite a few of these states ( or at least the people ) are more liberal and open-minded than western countries like russia . 
  very nice strawman you have there . 
  when you feel up to actually challenging what i said you know where to find me . 
   it 's still illegal to be gay in lebanon ... its unenforced though , and courts have ruled that the penal code can not be used to discriminate against lgbts . 
  but thats the qualification you want then its legal in jordan . 
  i genuinely feel sorry for sorry for lgbts siding with the far right , who only care about when they can use our death as a soapbox for their rhetoric . 
   name some me some secular , liberal nations where muslims are the majority . 
  so he reinstated it . 
  so we should prioritise emotions and fear over looking at the issue logically ? 
  has that ever gone well ? 
  iirc nationalsist are the majority in the corsican assembly, 
  he reinstated the bathroom law and made it legal to be fired for being lgbt . 
  oh but held up a flag once that makes it all ok ( ! ), 
   the church of england attacked cadbury for removing the word easter from chocolate eggs its a war on christianity i tell you !, 
  mike `` like the cock , get the shock '' pence ? 
   no they do n't , they are bigoted yet reasonable https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fopyrhhlt3m, 
   they want to kill you . 
  and you think the far right do n't ? 
  when they are citizens, 
  and those that are native born ? 
  a ) the majority of these attacks have been committed by native citizens of the respected countries b ) what your suggesting is arresting people for thought crimes , and thats a very dark road, 
   m\u00e9lenchon wo n't have a `` take it or leave it '' attitude during negotiation . 
  he 'll try his best to form coalition with other countries and with their combined weight and france 's sole prospect of leaving , convince other countries to ease up on austerity and liberalism . 
  you mean just like cameron tried ? 
  no same thing , just a unclickable page, 
  link does n't work, 
  maybe not stop but it 'll certainly be a crushing blow to many would-be terrorists, 
  most of mosul is free and the sdf is advancing on raqqa with each passing day . 
  i know its not over till its over but still . 
  so which one will have the drawn out civil war ? 
   unfortunately they did . 
  no they dont !, 
  nobody deserves to be the victims of a terrorist attack and sincerely fuck you for even suggesting it !, 
  i thought the prime minister said they 'd arrested one guy, 
  nah it looks adult sized . 
  the stuff around them looks like paramedic gear, 
  where ? 
  they 'll definitely claim it nonetheless, 
  what was even the logic there ? 
  `` oh i was going to protest but now its dark i might just go home '', 
  it 'll most likely stay a tory government tho, 
  this comment exemplifies the brexiteer outlook perfectly . 
  wistfully staring at the past , while ignoring the present . 
  so it be illegal to share something like [ this ? 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lz7-egzutug ), 
  he 's an idiot playing a smart man playing an idiot, 
  1 month, 
  is there a point to opinion polls when the result has already been decided ? 
  iirc its just the anthem is the ussr reworded edit : that being said , its still quite good, 
  i seriously stared at this for ages thinking `` why does indonesia have open borders with the eu ? '', 
   in spain they light bulls on fire and cut them open while their still alive and the eu doesnt say shit http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/11961010/eu-cuts-subsidies-that-support-spanish-bullfighting.html, 
  they already banned memes, 
  dont forget `` abusive relationship '', 
  bad rajul, 
  seriously , there 's been more reports on the bloody light nonsense than on the actual attacks, 
  ( fyrom ) macedonia : hey greece can i copy your homework greece : yeah just change it a bit so the teacher does n't notice . 
   i say that if people in the philippines want european-style human rights then they can achieve that on their own terms . 
  do you honestly think that people who live under authoritarian regimes do so out of choice ? 
  it is too much to ask for a teensy bit of self-respect and * not * deal with the muderous lunatic ? 
  the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, 
   i keep placing the word ` the ' infront of their name but i do n't know why . 
  iirc its because `` ukraine '' in old russian means borderland , thus `` the borderland '' . 
  which is why many modern ukrainians dont like it, 
  [ i was thinking more this ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w8qccczy03s ), 
  whats the large dot in the atlantic represent ? 
  and scotland , wales and brittany, 
  although he has given eastern thrace to bulgaria, 
  [ it started good in the west ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ofnko ), 
  #watch me #, 
  can someone eli5 why provence is so high ? 
   remainers hoped that people would start to think that leaving has this massive cost ive not seen any remainers claim that . 
  [ the initial meeting ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=coavbdk2s5s ), 
  at home : russia has beaten down the `` nazi kiev coup '' and the west abbroad : crimea recognised as part of russia by more nations and russia seems as strong it 's not what ukraine thinks but how it can be twisted, 
  if that is the case then there was nothing they could do . 
  ban her , russia spins anti-ukraine agenda . 
  do n't , russia say it 's a sign they relinquish crimea, 
  soon you wo n't be able to say for erdogan either,
