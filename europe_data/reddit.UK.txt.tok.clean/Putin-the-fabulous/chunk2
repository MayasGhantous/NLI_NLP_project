  rt lying ? 
  well i never !, 
  i do n't know how to :(, 
  [ 7:50 in ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ok5lmqoromi ), 
  you say that after you obviously exclude the main definition, 
   an instance of invading a country or region with an armed force . 
  from your own link . 
  note, 
  true though if so i 'd take off the london bridge attack , as there were only 8 victims ( the other deaths were the attacker . 
  you forgot this one https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollh\u00e4ttan_school_attack, 
  you keep using that word , i do not think means what you think it means . 
  you 're really surprised ? 
  the typical doommongers have been here for months . 
  it 's the same as when people where claiming certain syrians could n't be refugees because they had mobile phones . 
  those famous muslim strongholds of eastern europe and vietnam, 
  i know , which begs the question why this one is being upvoted when it added nothing new, 
   thread linked to donald  only commenters are flairless, 
  no , we were always awful, 
  when it comes to eastern europe / visegrad threads most of this sub is anti-eu, 
  thats not how it works . 
  death penalty is to do with council of europe , not eu, 
  people like that wont listen , they use it to validate their own position ( `` they 're attacking me because im right !, 
  the ira killed over 1,500 civilians during the trouble , dont try and act as they were some `` good '' terrorists, 
  no no , its the end of days !, 
  fear for your lives !, 
  it outran him, 
  if he did would you support twitter banning hate speech ? 
  or do you think radical islamists should be able to spread this hatred ? 
  its called r/the _ donald and its a laughing stock, 
  is 99 % likely to be isis/isis inspired, 
  5 day old account whining about `` dem leftists '' . 
  some variety would be nice for once, 
  no , thats clearly the queen of jamaica . 
  aladdin 7 : jaafar exploits the refugee crisis, 
   well , why is n't he saying anything about venezuela there was an article posted just yesterday on his statements . 
  you can question his position but no need to lie !, 
  and yet the generals disagree and say that its a bad decision . 
  also ignoring my second point which has no real motivation beyond `` fuck trans people '' . 
  last time i check lgbt is more than gay people, 
  perhaps because under obama lgbt rights improved while in the few months of trump they 've onky worsed . 
  he banned trans people from serving in the military and reinforced the bathroom law , you call that nothing ? 
  reverse yaoi hands, 
  not invaded but that 's does mean we 've done nothing, 
  it is , however , ironic that it calls itself `` the last refuge of free speech '' while doing it . 
  democracy is non negotiable, 
  you upset the hivemind, 
  im not saying which is worse or more prominent , just pointing out that it did exist in christianity too ( he was saying it did n't ), 
  i think they 'll need a bit more than a single image with a few textboxes stuck on top . 
   chris williamson said it would be `` better to facilitate talks '' between the government and the opposition . 
  has he been living under a rock for the last few years ? 
  its not present in modern christianity but its has been there in the past . 
  numerous christians use to revel in killing `` heathen '' and `` pagans '', 
  apparently they found a fourth guy , so it 's literally four lions, 
  we attack at sunset !, 
  where else would `` stockholm '' be ? 
  the majority of crimes are just that . 
   and , yes , i personally would fill much safer if i knew that there are no muslims at some event - will you call me racist yep . 
  also tell me would you call me rational if i said id feel safer at an event which banned straight white men ( who statistically committ most crimes ) ? 
  funny considering that brexiteers are currently screaming that they eu is trying `` fine us for leaving '', 
  the ashanti empire , the kingdom of dahomey , the kingdom of kongo , the various swahili city states . 
  africa had several strong , stable and european-style nation states which were ripped apart by the colonialists . 
  you could n't be more wrong if you think africa was nothing before european arrived . 
   fortunately people like you will be the first to go . 
  thats not a warning , thats gleefully hoping for someone death . 
  as much hate as this is going to get me , that does n't prove its terrorism . 
  it highly increases the chance that it it but right now its just speculation, 
  useful in determining how the public judges the ruling party 's actions, 
   there are deaf blind kids who grow up to become adults , many have a variety of extra illnesses and disabilities ontop of that . 
  you 're really understating his condition here . 
  the brain damage was to the point where the doctor were unsure if he was capable of thought and he was unable to move his arms and legs . 
  he had to have air forced into his lungs to simply breathe . 
  even if were are to assume by some miracle charlie survived infancy he would n't become a functioning adult with a minor disability , he be on constant life support and have limited , if any , mental ability . 
  is that really `` life '' ? 
  additionally the american doctor had n't visited charlie until court ordered to ( at which point he agreed with the ormund st doctors ) and had n't read much of the info/patient notes on his condition . 
  the guy seemed questionable at best . 
  theresa may confirmed as mod !, 
  so will r/europe now discuss how 50 year old finns are a danger to our way of life ? 
   it would narrow it down from the entire continent of asia to only a select few countries , the term already does as its mainly used for indo-pakistanis . 
  just because you , a yugoslav person , does n't understand what a british term mean does n't mean its some conspiracy of `` the progressives '' . 
  simply that it was n't intended for you to read . 
  edit : ta for the corrections, 
   let 's pretend the uk newspaper do n't say `` asian '' instead of a muslim yes lets , because that what happens you tosspot . 
  `` newspapers use descriptives to describe person '' fucking shocking that !, 
  or using a term thats commonplace here in the uk . 
  but noo , it must be some leftist conspiracy !, 
  [ just ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollh\u00e4ttan_school_attack ) [ one ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/quebec_city_mosque_shooting ) [ guy ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_irish_republican_army ), 
   i 'm simply talking about the benefits of a clear approach to cultural and social cohesion rather than embracing an attempt to mix massively divergent cultures within the same country you admit in your own comments that this approach has massive problems , including attacks not only by ughurs but also by tibetians and hong kongers . 
  meanwhile , india remians peaceful and stable by embracing their diversity and using it to build bridges between communities . 
  the chinese approach only looks good because they suppress and abduct all those who are against it . 
  if you talk to the people china does this to , you 'll find mass resentment and hatred towards china and the han chinese, 
  quebec too, 
   you ca n't take a white brit , plop him in china and give him a piece of paper and make him `` chinese '' . 
  you analogy does work as the ugyhur are native to the land , its was the chinese who conquered it and declared them `` chinese '' . 
  most of them have wanted china gone for decades , as they 're attacking their culture and customs to cultural cleanse them . 
  the `` ethnic ghettos '' you talk about are in places like urumqi and hong kong , where han chinese people are pushing out native populations . 
  the situation in xijiang is nothing like current immigration , but akin to francos persecution of the basque and catalans . 
  come on m-morty we , we got ta remove * burp * kebab , morty !, 
   there are tons of people from puerto rico , cuba , and the dominican republic here , and it can refer to any of them , unlike `` asian '' in the u.k. `` asian '' here can refer to anyone from india , pakistan , bangladesh , maldives and in certain cases afghanistan and nepal . 
  you were wrong , stop digging and admit it . 
   boils down to skin , eye and hair color .
