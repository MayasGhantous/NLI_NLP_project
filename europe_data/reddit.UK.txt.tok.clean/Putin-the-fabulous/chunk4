  i like the president but who 's the guy on the left ? 
   future mysterious deaths of europe ftfy, 
   enjoy, 
  it tastes disgusting too, 
   the court of appeal case could lead to other schools that practise similar segregation across the country having to make drastic changes to how they operate good . 
  which city ? 
  dont be rude . 
  toilets serve a function , farage does not . 
  i mean yeah it happened , theres historical records of it . 
  just because you do n't like it does n't mean it does n't exist, 
  oh my god , they killed abu !, 
  you kufrs !, 
  china and india agree with you . 
  if i can ask a question to belarussians , what are the differences ( if any ) between the belarusian language and russian ? 
  jeez the bigotry in this thread . 
  just let the guy live his life and be happy however he wants . 
  no mail is . 
  that does n't mean they 're good though, 
  i think i remember hearing that they speak a mix of russian and belarusian ( transyanka i think its called ), 
  inb4 `` of course sweden '', 
  a ) it 's london , there 's been terrorists attacks since the 60s . 
  b ) no it 's not the same . 
  having a fire extinguisher does n't mean there will be a fire , but that you will be ready in case one happens, 
   he did say that terrorism was `` part and parcel '' of living in a city no he did n't , i 'm sick of seeing this spread everywhere . 
  he said being prepared for an attack is part of living in a big city , not the attack itself . 
   if africa was never colonized and the west never interacted with it would still be a tribal society today , this is just false . 
  while we could argue about the hypothetical prosperity of the continent africa has had states and empires just as long as europe or asia . 
  reddit lives off black and white thinking, 
  can someone give a summary ? 
  i just want to know if it should give it views or not, 
  how was gdynia able to hold out longer than the rest of western poland ? 
  * andrea leadsom liked this . 
  ^ terms ^ and ^ conditions ^ apply, 
  close , `` lock nay '', 
  no , its too dry . 
  desertification is not an easy thing to reverse, 
  not the organ organs !, 
   the different libyan governments are n't advancing on eachother a la syria . 
  um yes they are . 
  very much so . 
  yep , and this is where most of the opposition to the visegrad position comes from . 
  its easy to complain and make statesments when its not happening on your doorstep . 
   to claim otherwise is pure revisionism . 
  i 'm not sure why you 're surprised , brexiteers have been back-pedalling since the result was announced, 
  cousin , lady jane grey . 
  but muh victim narrative !, 
   / r/europe is like an antifa forum ideology wise . 
  you 're joking right ? 
  just look at any post on migrants/refugees tell me if you can see a single left-wing comment on positive, 
  most of those `` discussions '' have just devolved into circlejerks at this point, 
  nobody ever said it was n't . 
  they do on the_donald, 
  politicians , non-refugee brown people , `` leftists '' , anyone else they hate, 
  i need to move to portugal . 
  i see them expressing their sexuality every day everywhere , why ca n't i express mine for even one day ? 
  one being bad does n't make the other good, 
  what about [ this ] ( https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/9/93/samara_character_box.png/revision/latest?cb=20110515165629 ) samara ? 
  ok no more gay pride and no more straight people showing any form of affection at all . 
   with headquarters in austria and france , im just quoting the article, 
  you wont criticise people for illegally blockading boats , even when told to stop by the italian coast guard ? 
  what they 're doing is just as illegal as the butn cars in hamburg, 
  there were 3/4 of them, 
   it will do whatever it can to protect italian identity and culture from outsiders . 
  says group from outside italy, 
  no you see it 's a 16th demensional chess because ... ^ / s, 
  that mostly occurred due to diseases that the natives could n't deal with . 
  ok thanks , 
  at risk of sounding dumb , whats the difference ? 
  why nothing for [ manchester ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/manchester_metrolink ) ? 
   only to be killed after an old woman threw a rooftile on his head . 
  was n't there another famous greek person who died when a turtle was dropped on his head ? 
  he has a goatee and a pointed moustache , of course he 's awful, 
  they did n't call her `` bloody mary '' for nothing, 
  * burned, 
  `` wait no , i still want attention '', 
  gee thanks / s, 
  that 's disappointing, 
   legitimate concerns are laughed away on here . 
  oh bog off , everytime anything related to migrants / refugees appears the comments are always filled with the same circlejerky trip ( `` deport them now '' `` religion of peace lol '' `` part and parcel haha '' ) . 
  it 's these people who are blocking any form of discussion . 
  bigger hands, 
  one of china 's bridges in kenya just collapsed days after opening . 
  chinese quality is horrible, 
  no but right-wing groups love grandstanding about violence on the left, 
  20 % , though in my defence all the mountainous look identical, 
  probably because he did n't write it, 
   it seems that a 23 year-old compromise , which only allows abortion in cases of rape or incest or when the health of the mother or foetus is seriously endangered , will remain in place . 
  so its still banned but not a total . 
  dont claim im parroting nonsense when you dont read your own sources . 
  i 'll admit that `` ban '' may not be the right word but the law [ wasnt rejected ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/25/catastrophe-rape-survivors-poland-limits-access-morning-pill/ ), 
   commitment to freedom and liberty you are taking the same country that just banned abortion and contraception because the old sky man said so ? 
  so much for the tolerant right !, 
  no shakira law , only the law of [ the bibble ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ait4aho-77k ), 
   disappointingly perhaps for mr trump and his polish hosts only a small crowd turned out  he entered through the back door, 
   marriage is deeply rooted in our society and changing its traditional definition may have consequences we cant predict now . 
  yeah because marriages are still arranged by the parents in exchange for three oxen , two pigs and a chicken . 
  so trump is soros ? 
  [ endangered animals of europe - the andorran ( less the 40,000 left ) ] ( http://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/news/080803_p07_low1.jpg ),
