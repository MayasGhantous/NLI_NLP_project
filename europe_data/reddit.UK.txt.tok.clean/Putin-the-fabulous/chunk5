   a dog in a chruch = an unwanted guest let him in !, 
  that turtle is huge, 
  tired sea dog, 
  very open and green , i like it , 
  i did n't realise the cdu was on the left . 
  why are you so anti-semetic !, 
  `` the left '' on the internet is basically just a placeholder . 
  i can mean anything and be applied to anything anytime . 
  the idea that progressive movements are a way to subtly convert nations to communism and marxism while destroying western culture . 
  people actually believe this is a real thing !, 
   the israeli government tried to seized cows some villagers bought as they considered it a `` national security threat '' . 
  were those cows part of hezbullah ? 
  how many '' bloody soros ' '' should we expect ? 
   `` from now on , you can not call your parents ` mum ' or ` dad ' because it is not in the law . '', 
  jesus the victim complexes on some people, 
  whats up with those trees ? 
   alerts users for the parisien no-go zones . 
  from what i can tell its just a crime reporter app with the `` no-go zone '' label tagged on . 
  hardly definitive proof . 
  it called bamburgh castle for those wanting to know . 
  also a short distance to [ lindisfarne ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lindisfarne ), 
   i plan on dismissing your poor arguments you do n't even know my `` arguments '' and yet you 've already judged them . 
  jog on , chancer, 
   the only way to avoid this is having a homogeneous society by that logic the uk should be split up into the constituent countries . 
   what on earth are you talking about ? 
  i really want you to expand on this so i can fully dismiss every point you make `` i do n't even know what your talking about but i know you 're wrong anyway '', 
  im not fucking google , do some research yourself !, 
   ** 2.2 million in lebanon ** yep , blind, 
   ** the turkish camps ran out of space . 
  ** are you blind as well as stupid ? 
  lebanon too . 
  iirc the refugees make up about 1/3 of their current population, 
  or you made a claim you could n't back up and then tried shifting the goal posts . 
   they would stop in turkey millions have , the turkish camps ran out of space . 
   country with islamic culture . 
  2.2 million in lebanon and 1.25 million in jordan . 
  edit : downvote evidence and upvote nonsense speculation . 
  typical, 
  except enoch powell was talking about afro-carribeans who are nowadays more british than the british . 
  chaotic good, 
  good title , that is not . 
  the welsh assembly is more [ boring ] ( https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/117ab/production/_90059517_assembling.jpg ) [ cool exterior though ] ( https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p01lc3p2.jpg ), 
  * begining of the estonian civil war *, 
  lichtenstein just copies switzerland, 
  the oldest continuous parliament in the world ( over 1000 year ), 
  the czech senate looks more like a dull lecture hall than a parliament, 
  also that for them it was legalised by a court with many kicking and screaming . 
  it had already been posted last night . 
  til 2015 is `` years ago '', 
  spain has two cities in africa, 
  [ `` smiling '' ] ( https://i.redd.it/n55dfw9zcvux.png )  he hasnt done such thing [ yeah he has ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/r-trump-administration-drops-north-carolina-bathroom-bill-lawsuit-report-2017-4 ) . 
  [ even his supporters hated this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/caitlyn-jenner-donald-trump-trans-bathrooms-british-lgbt-awards-human-rights-a7733326.html%3famp ), 
   the president of the united states waved a rainbow flag before his election . 
  upside down , with his slogan written over it and looking throughly uncomfortable . 
  and while merkel voted against it she allowed a vote , while trump pushes through anti-trans pro-discrimination orders with no votes . 
  it would also complete western europe for equality . 
  * pushes northern ireland into corner *, 
   direct involvement in the ukraine !, 
  given for one the evidence is servicemen and weapons captured and for the other its photoshoped google maps pictures , no you cant . 
  plus a large part of isis dogma revolves around fighting the `` army of rome '' ( ie the west / christians ), 
   the man said he had wanted to avenge attacks linked to islamic state that have killed dozens in paris over the past years . 
  avenge people killed in terror attacks by killing people in a terror attack ... 
  we are the estonians , resistance is futile . 
   currently impossible ** with the tools we have . 
  ** unless this guy has some device to rewrite dna , that nobody else has heard of , i can say conclusively that this wo n't cure his disease . 
   how do you know all that ? 
  because i fucking studied genetics !, 
   and if there wo n't be any attempts to cure them , forever . 
  to cure a genetic disease would require changing every copy of the gene in the body , which is currently impossible with the tools we have . 
  the most this treatment can hope to do is extend his life span a few month to a year , which will be spent back in hospital and in pain . 
  is it not better to allow the child to die in peace and with dignity that to keep him alive chasing a cure that most likely does n't exist ? 
   there are conditions in which a patient might recover to some degree it treated genetic diseases , especially mitochondrial ones , do not . 
  they persist and cause great harm and discomfort for the suffers . 
   most diseases have been fatal at some stage . 
  theres a massive difference between dying of a stroke in 50 years and dying of a debilitating disease in less than 1, 
  how can you remove that which does not exist ? 
  a lizard, 
  italy tried that before , it was a spectacular failure . 
  i knew i should n't have looked but ...  they 're going to do every thing they can to flood our nations , jews will do everything they can to bring them in, 
  the result is already made, 
   average czech hates other czechs damn czechs , they ruined czechia !, 
   but the only real comparison in the uk would be northern ireland . 
  or , you know , the republic of ireland , which left us in the 1920s, 
   decolonisation was done and over by france over 60 years ago . 
  yet they held onto algeria til the 60s and still have strong independence movements in new caledonia and french polynesia . 
  yep . 
  only 1/3rd polled supported her but people were acting like it was 100 % . 
  these teenagers massacred innocent people ? 
  or are they to blame for the actions of others ? 
  being harassed and spat on while the authorities refuse to do anything is `` banal shit '' ? 
  should have used [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/flag_of_the_city_of_london.svg/1200px-flag_of_the_city_of_london.svg.png ) for london, 
  they are very greek, 
  to some the word `` annexation '' give legitimacy to the russian side and so they prefer `` occupation '' . 
   you are a contentious people . . you just made an enemy for life !, 
  tbf the third comment down ( on +50 ) is saying its a good thing . 
   there is a heightened awareness and quicker reactions is that meant to be a bad thing ? 
  the way this article is worded is seems like thats what they 're going for . 
  you are a circlejerk, 
  are we america yet ? 
   wash bear thats an odd name for a trash panda,
