  go cry with bolivia, 
  especially portugal, 
   mosque founder seyran ates is now being murdered . 
  is this an error in translation or ... 
   `` countries '' , includes catalonia incoming angry spainards, 
  the last two attacks here were from people who had been reported by the mosque and local community . 
  many more plots have been identified and stopped by community support . 
  the problem is `` muslim leader condemns x group '' doesnt sell papers , while '' jihadis eat streak with ketchup '' does . 
   the actual bit of european integration that prevented any possibility of a conflict between ( western ) european countries from happening was the ecsc . 
  which became the eu . 
  yeah but has the eu ever done for us ? 
  edit : a lot of people misssing the joke . 
   julius caesar was roman and born 300 years after the parthenon was finished . 
  finally something we can agree on, 
  they were already unhappy with lebanon 's demographic as it was . 
  including the alawite region would have started the civil war much earlier . 
  many christian nations in africa kill and imprison gays , while muslim countries like albania and jordan do n't punish homosexuality . 
  you ca n't treat things as monolithic blocs . 
  yeah why ca n't people just call for mosque bombings and putting muslims on a bonfire ? 
  born exactly six months later, 
  she looks barely over 200 . 
  her name is [ angela zoe uk specimen ] ( https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/aaeaaqaaaaaaaaqcaaaajdixnwjmzdq5ltnknzatndvkoc05ytqyltm4nzk2zdlimtnioa.jpg ), 
  [ well ] ( http://newsthump.com/2017/02/23/alien-life-beyond-the-solar-system-already-eying-up-uk-benefits-system-warns-nigel-farage/ ), 
  the `` phenomenon '' was all over the christian world for centuries , and was in fact absent from africa until christian missionaries arrived . 
   and when exactly last time conservative christians were hurling homosexual people from roofs , or hanging , or decapitating them ? 
  this year in sub-saharan africa . 
  remember kids , there is a world outside of the west !, 
   accidents happen . 
  even to muslims . 
  yeah , ramming a truck into a mosque is an `` accident '' fuck off , troll . 
  i never claimed a phobia did that ... ( redditor for 22 days and only four comments , shocking ), 
  what on earth are you on about what relevance does it have to what i said ? 
  very nice strawman you made there . 
  nobody said you should n't make anything of the attacks but that you should n't let them get to you and not to retaliate against those who share only a a minor tangential link . 
  people are making a big deal out it because people like you , who stoke the flames of division by cliaming that all muslims were inherently terrorists , were explicitly saying something like it ( innocent muslims being targeted ) would n't happen . 
  you could if you had n't killed them all . 
  and those were said to be due to western intervention in the middle east . 
  nothing excuses terrorism , no matter who commits it !, 
  because they all preach from the same script `` fight for us and you will have glory '' . 
  the london guy was white . 
  and here i thought human rights were universal !, 
  time to kick out the silesians and moravians then ? 
   so far nothing of this sort has happened in poland . 
  [ page 41 ] ( https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/europol_tesat_2016.pdf ), 
  what kind of sicko calls a van running down pedestrians `` a glorious day '' ? 
  remember the quebec attack ? 
  the borissia dortmund bus ? 
  1 dead already, 
  often they 're interlinked . 
  an attack is committed in vendetta against the state . 
  of course we were properly informed ; we give # 350 per week to the eu and turkey is joining next tuesday . 
  white british are 80 % of the u.k. !, 
  but the war on christians !, 
  ca n't we have one thread without this shit ? 
   russia has not that kind of authority over chechnya . 
  its a part of their country . 
   why must muslims in our countries be `` respected and educated '' but christains in theirs be facing constant suppression and hatred ? 
  because its easier to affect you own country than others ? 
  you can support both in both countries though your influence will be much stronger in one than the other . 
  you could use the same argument for christians . 
  surely its better to try and fail then to never try at all . 
  [ not many ( population density ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/population_density_of_portugal.png/300px-population_density_of_portugal.png ), 
  i doubt it tbh , many studies show that migrants birth rates generally fall to native levels in a few generations . 
  when have politicaians ever given back rights they 've taken . 
   defend yourself but you step on your values if you abandon your values to fight an enemy seeking to make you abandon those values what are you actually fighting for ? 
  so bomb schools then / s, 
  no we cause floods . 
  we should call it macedonia-ia, 
   should be kept close ... to prevent his return to ukip theres keeping your enemies close and then there giving them the keys to your house !, 
  they are n't immigrants , they 're * ex-pats *, 
  fuck suadi arabia, 
  theoretically any european country can join the eu . 
  though i can only see montenegro joining anytime soon . 
  not really , they usually blow the items before making sure its real just to be safe, 
  because he a reactionary nut whos upset le pen failed, 
   that sounds totally simplistic because it is . 
  and even if paul is not the cause , he aggravated the situation and made it worse . 
   what a special snowflake ftfy, 
   but for burning a book ? 
  a specific religious book . 
  i do n't agree with the arrest but lets not pretend that it was a random choice . 
  and look how that worked for them in the election . 
  hes lost every election hes stood in , nobody should care about him, 
  someone should tell them what their ancestors got upto , 
   the left hates freedom and democracy with a passion but the right hates freedom and democracy . 
  le rational centrist ^ tm, 
  im sure that 'll make those toutured ( while the police turn blind eye ) feel sooo much better !, 
  [ better ?

  [ yeah no ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/filmmaker-anti-gay-vigilantes-/26622840.html ), 
   could we please finally acknowledge that there 's something wrong with islam ? 
  theres nothing wrong with acknowledging the problems of islam but it is wrong to imply that a majority of muslims support isis , which you and the other guy are doing also wahhabism is far from a mainstream branch . 
  sufism is the largest . 
   he 's trying to lasso us into a war with iran now , would n't bibbi like trump then , as hes turning on iran ? 
  no no , only brown people are terrorists , whites are * mentally ill *, 
  two birds one stone, 
  yes for us . 
  you ca n't ignore a problem and expect it to go away forever . 
  labour party says will seek to form minority government http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-election-mcdonnell-idukkbn1900qk, 
   theresa may has no intention of resigning how many uturns is that now ?
