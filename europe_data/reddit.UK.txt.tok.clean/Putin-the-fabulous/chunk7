  ive lost count, 
  he said trustable , not good, 
  also she currently has a slim majority in government and is banking on the election giving her a stronger mandate, 
  no wonder the coup failed then !, 
  its a tory election leaflet ( source : got one in the post ), 
  i assume russia 's invasion did that, 
  i think it 's measuring democracy through the [ freedom index ] ( https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index ), 
  [ wont somebody please think of the children !, 
  ] ( http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj6gzajomt1qam0yp.jpg ), 
  only one fits his narrative, 
  `` asian '' means south asian ( indo-pakistani ) in british english . 
  to do with the election maybe ? 
  france had bunch right before theirs . 
   english nationalism is bad , yet scottish nationalism is good ? 
  most english nationalism is ethnic nationalism ( ie your only english through blood/skin ) while scottish nationalism is typically civic ( anyone who follows scottich values is scottish ) . 
   terrorism should be no different . 
  thats what the point of these stats , to point out that terrorism should be treated like any other problem , and not as an apocalyptic `` the sky is falling '' spectacle that the media portrays it to be . 
  just another reason to do it, 
  `` when i was a boy and i would see scary things in the news , my mother would say to me , ` look for the helpers . 
  you will always find people who are helping . '' - fred rodgers, 
  people wont finish their beer without migrants ? 
  these threads also get a lot of non-subscribers coming in too, 
  mainly stop saudi and salafi funded mosques . 
  these are the main breeding grounds of the current crop of jihadis, 
  mainly stop saudi and salafi funded mosques . 
  these are the main breeding grounds of the current crop of jihadis, 
   until we fight back against the source . 
  literally two comments above you :  no !, 
  isis territory shrinks day by day , while the taliban fails to make ground in afghanistan . 
  as i said , read first, 
  what a lovely strawman you 've made , now how about reading what i actually wrote !, 
  not even remotely . 
  that only happens when we give into these sickos , and let our fear rule us . 
  we do n't . 
   have we actually left the terrorists to win ? 
  isis territory shrinks day by day , while the taliban fails to make ground in afghanistan . 
  the situation may be far from perfect but it 's nowhere near as bleak as you make it out to be . 
  what could have been without the coup, 
  either kazakhstan is more northern than i thought or britain is more southern, 
  it is the default position , people only act like it 's not, 
   ethic cleansing is the only solution and anyone who does n't agree with me is literally the same as isis making strawmen is fun is n't it ? 
   the only group of people i ca n't stand are idealists who deny real-world facts because they do n't fit their moralist views such as people who think you can take all muslims in a country and ship them off to another with no consequences ? 
  and now for another round of , islamist or alright ? 
  who hates human rights more ? 
   muh human rights and all that . 
  human rights are a bad thing now ? 
  also a lot of them are natural-born citizens . 
  yeah it says only about 3,000 pose an actual risk . 
  still not great but the title is a massive overstatement edit : ah r/europe where reactionary bullshit is more important than reading the evidence, 
  because people in civilised countries dont belive in ethnic cleansing and collective punishment, 
  could still be . 
  after the london attack they made seven arrests in connection but all were later cleared, 
  [ why do i even bother ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/fjr6v88opk7u4/giphy.gif ), 
  no dont, 
   what about pre-emptive raids since these guys are all known to the police ? 
  you mean like the ones that just occurred in london ? 
  do you honestly think that the police just sit around on their arse all day ? 
  trying to strom a german ministry and throwing flares a boat being pulled by the italian navy though does n't help their case, 
  how is progressivism more conservative than liberalism ? 
   can anybody explain the stance of labour on the single market and free movement of people ? 
  juncker doesnt spending his time whining about how terrible the eu is while using it to line his pockets , farage does ( when he can be bother to show up that is ) it not the amout that makes me dislike farage but the hypocrisy, 
  theres a notable difference between `` taking part in a political process '' and `` taking 2 + million a year in expenses while never showing up '' . 
  quelle surprise, 
  rhodes and bosnia , distant twins / s, 
  except the current `` civil war '' is being [ lead ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_borodai ) [ by ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/valery_bolotov ) [ russians ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/igor_strelkov_ ( officer ) ), 
  anything that restricts her power must go, 
  a large base of ukip comes from ex-bnp supporters . 
  ukip just put a pretty face onto its racism, 
  the worst kind, 
  i dont think you know what that word means . 
  welcome back to the 1970s, 
  will i agree with the sentiment , this seems an obvious case of do as i say not as i do, 
  you know you sound exactly like an sjw ( like ive seen those exact words in that order from them before ), 
  also turkey and other surrounding countires are baring the main brunt of them . 
  the ones that come to europe barely make 10-20 % of the total number of refugees, 
  op is against the eu and freedom of movement, 
  does not this sub ( him included ) berate migrants from non-war countries , cliaming that we should only help `` actual refugees '', 
  that 'd make you a migrant, 
  they did those annoying ads with kerry katona . 
  a half finished packet of salt & vinger crisps has a better chance than corbyn, 
  not according to ben [ `` pump my rump , trump '' ] ( https://grrrgraphics.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/trump_president_ben_garrison.jpg ) garrison . 
  i thought it was due to alien refugees from the planet of [ pyrovillia ] ( http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/the_fires_of_pompeii_ ( tv_story ) ), 
  we tried golden dawns version of europe less than a century ago . 
  it did n't end well for anyone . 
  i am the senate !, 
  he literally said he was `` real music '' and called the others `` fast food '' . 
  yeah that pretentious , especially as reading in other thread that he got famous from a pop show . 
  its also extremely callous after being given an award to turn around ans whine about how much better you are then everyone else . 
  she sang it better than him . 
  honestly his performance came off flat and disinterested, 
  think they said heart condition, 
  ok portugal why send the pretentious ass when his sister ( who wrote the song ) is 1000 times better ? 
  theres a difference between mocking something will enjoying it and acting as if you 're better than everyone else . 
  seriously ? 
  he was the most emotionless singer i 've ever seen, 
  the 19th century was when it became independent from france . 
  though the demographic change is mostly due to the civil war and aftermath edit : 20th century . 
  uganda works though, 
   eagle trying to steal book please do n't take it from me , my wife is pregnant, 
  the size of the bars dont make any sense ( 39 % is longer than 51 % ),
