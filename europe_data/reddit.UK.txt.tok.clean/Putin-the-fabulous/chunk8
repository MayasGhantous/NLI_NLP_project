  not entirely . 
  a twenty something will have had extensive experience on the internet , giving them a wider view of the world , meanwhile the middle aged person will have experience from a cold-war perspective and so it will be less relevant . 
  edit : less relevant to current world trends, 
   when isis was winning in the middle east were they putting out weekly calls for terrorist attacks in europe ? 
  no they were n't . 
  yeah they were , and those attacks were much more ferocious ( the bataclan ) meanwhile now all they can muster is one lone idiot every once in a while . 
   the issues that made people vote fn are not going away . 
  except they are . 
  when the cracks start showing from brexit and teump fn euroskepticism will viewed quetionably , and the imminent death of isis will eliminate most of the terrorist threat that they rode on . 
  well they 're brown innit . 
  the stars were aligned for an fn victory in france and pvv victory in the netherlands and yet both flubbed it . 
  at least you 're not a `` traitor '' . 
  it was before it happened, 
   the tories ' brexit policy is very popular so was going into iraq , and we all saw how well that panned out . 
  the majority in favour of leaving are in the older age group , while the younger one supports being in the eu . 
  not to mention that the situation the tories want is vastly inferior to the one enjoyed by the eea countries, 
  it sets quite a worrying precedent though , that at any point for whatever reason the government can just decide to remove someone citizenship . 
  it also preachs against the attack and/or killing of non-muslims and says that they should be treated good in society , least those muslims lose favour with god . 
   quran 5:69 says : `` surely they that believe , and those of jewry , and the christians , and those sabeaans , whoso believes in god and the last day , and works righteousness -- their wage waits them with their lord , and no fear shall be on them , neither shall they sorrow . '' but like every religion people pick and choose to suite the own agenda . 
  edit : upvote an unsubstantiated cliam and when someone presents evidence to the contrary downvote it heavily . 
  this sub is complete trash, 
  if nobody cares why are you so bothered by it ? 
  and israel can into eastern europe, 
  the problem with step 2 is we 're the ones fucking up these countries in the first place, 
  to make a lovely fur coat, 
  never heard of 'em, 
   paris and the metropolitan areas love macron , and the rest of france wants marine le pen [ lol ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/07/world/europe/france-election-results-maps.html ), 
  `` take a loss '' being code for `` retreat to the_donald and post ` france is dead ' memes '', 
  splitters !, 
   ca n't wait for isis to decimate europe . 
  aah the_nold , supporting terrorist to prove a point, 
  do n't insult animals but comparing them to those things !, 
  [ they 're really trying now ] ( http://m.imgur.com/account/putinthefabulous/images/ykysm5d ), 
  i just looked on le_pen and some of the posts were `` rip france '' and `` joan d'arc is rolling in her grave '' lol, 
  slow down !, 
  do you hear the_donald cry ? 
  crying the song of angry babies ? 
  why is st barth\u00e9lemy so pro-le pen ? 
   if you think the the allies were right to attack the reich then you justify wars in the name of defeating evil and preventing further suffering . 
  wwii was the result of germany reneging on their treaties and invading poland . 
  its only later that it became a `` good vs evil '' fight . 
   countries turning into red dictatorships under people like pol pot was a reason for the west to fight a `` good war '' yeah because look how great countries like chile , spain and afghanistan turned out from the us `` fighting a good war '', 
  ah the cameron manoeuvre, 
  but why male models ? 
  i 'd assume its to do with recognising who has sovereignty over unesco sites in jerusalem, 
  you couldnt even be bother to find an actual picture of the isis flag ? 
  they 're in germany , and so they follow german law ( which is anti-death penalty ) if they want to vote and have these laws they can return to turkey, 
  we 're sorry for his existence, 
  4d chess, 
  yeah the west midlands is boring, 
  yeah , from the coventry blitz, 
  we also have tons of useless but fun words , like defenestration, 
  [ let us not forget 2013 ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ocfhfnxu5jg ), 
  he 's reinstated the trans bathroom law and is planning to pass an executive order allowing for lgbt-based discrimination in the workplace . 
  and that not even mationing mike `` zaps for traps '' pence, 
  her party 's stance has always been agaisnt lgbt right and she herself has siad she 'll repeal gay marriage . 
   this argument came up again and again when trump was running too yeah and its been proven right . 
  even without the eu hes complete twat . 
  rude , self-important and arrogant, 
  the excessive nativism and general dislike for lgbts, 
  i love our prime minister . 
  shes a great uniter and is working hard to get the best deal for the british people , and showing great leader ship through it !, 
  * turns to spy camera * is that is right big brother ? 
  the vid focuses on america but i wonder who would have taken over in india and west africa . 
  ( australia and nz im assuming would be dutch ), 
   it 's called ` pounded by the pound ' . 
  [ you could at least post the cover ] ( https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/51jj62vuvxl._sy445_ql70_.jpg ), 
  [ probably like her ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/caitlyn-jenner-trump-transgender-trnd/ ), 
  `` everything is normal '' does n't sell papers, 
  hillary did win the popular vote , which is how france runs their election, 
  [ whoosh ] ( http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/middle_east98.jpg ), 
  hitler school musical, 
  i was going to ask about the bubbles but then i noticed the giant black legs in the background, 
  used to be called moldavia and/or bessarabia . 
  speak romanian but dont like to admit it . 
  poorest in europe, 
  are they meant to look intimidating ? 
  cause they look like just a bunch of accountants, 
   one of those people that believe there is actually an extreme right in enough numbers to actually matter . 
  pediga , golden dawn , jobbik , edl . 
  and thats ignoring the isolated attacks like in quebec and norway . 
  yeah the trailer was specifically designed to be controversial . 
  it makes sense if people dont like it, 
  holy strawman , batman !, 
  the data shows that brexit was most strongly supported by low wage earners and those without a he degree . 
  buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo, 
  so what would you say if , for instance , algeria set up algerian schools in france ? 
  and if you oppose it do you not think it hypocritical to support these type of schools outside france while opposing them inside ? 
  i mean thats already happening in russia and turkey, 
  used to be . 
  unfortunately dictators are coming back into fashion in europe, 
   nobody can seriously say that the us are anti-immigration country . 
  [ actually ] ( http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2015/08/gettyimages-165357970-e.jpeg ) [ you ] ( http://images.asian-nation.org/anti-chinese-5a.jpg ) [ can ] ( http://affinitymagazine.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/antiimig.jpg ), 
  not everything has to do with brexit !, 
   you honestly believe marine le pens death squads are going to be going from door to door killing gays do n't you ? 
  it been happening in putins russia for years , and thats the model le pen wants for france, 
  you 're yelling at a robot . 
  although the spread of the afd voters did suprise me ( i though itd be at least 50 % le pen ), 
  a dark future indeed, 
  oh shove off you useless old fart !,
