   i would honestly be weary of women whom , when in isolation and complete safety , defend their burka . 
  `` i would be wary of women who think differently to how i think '' seriously you 're saying they dont have choice and then when they disagree you tell them no . 
  you 're the one treating them like objects , and not independent thinking people !, 
  indeed . 
  we should always put effort into letting these women have a choice over it , rather than forcing them one way or another . 
  it clear poles are incompatible with our culture/s, 
   what exactly is `` some degree of representation '' ? 
  being recognised as a significant part of the country and not being treated like dirt by the current ruling party . 
   heck , one of them was just elected speaker of the parliament !, 
  yeah and look at the reaction from vrmo supporters . 
  edit ; nice stealth edit , `` ok the people beating them up are bad but its clearly the albanians fault ! '', 
  re : the last paragraph the situations are much different . 
  albanians have been living in macedonia longer than there has been a macedonian state and constitute ~ 30 % of the population . 
  they deserve to have some degree of representation . 
   during the searches , ** two illegal weapons were confiscated . 
   patrick maisonneuve , a lawyer for the parliament , confirmed the amount to french news agency afp . 
  aaw is somebody uspet the waifu is being exposed ? 
  [ why stop there ] ( https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:proposed_german_national_flag_1948.svg ), 
  spoke french though so they might have thought he was a maronite from lebanon, 
   why complain about nothing changing when you never vote for change ? 
  change for the sake of change never ends well . 
  but they are part of a european nation . 
  your comparison is like saying ecuador can join the eu becuase an overseas region of france is . 
  those are countries though . 
  its a completely different senario, 
  which ? 
  all the countries in the eu are in europe, 
  so he should have lied to them ? 
  actually not that bad of an article, 
  [ the photo of welsh men ] ( https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56c250b0ab48dedeadbef9f9/t/58ba2268db29d66bb3a05b9e/1488593513042/sheep-open-mouth.jpg?format=1500w ), 
  `` targeting actual terrorists will do nothing , instead we need to abuse law-abiding citizens just for their religion . 
  that wont cause mass resentment '', 
   for the love of god deal with this now . 
  we already are !, 
  france has had forces destroying terrorists cells in north africa for almost decade , and the coalition forces push isis closer and closer to its inevitable death each day . 
  this may shock you but there are ways of dealing with terrorism that do n't revolve around randomly harassing law-abiding muslim civilians, 
  you have n't quite grasped the concept of `` previously '' have you ? 
  its not getting worse though . 
  previously terrorists had various weapons and bombs and killed upwards in the hundreds in single attacks , now they 're resorting to car jacking and the numbers are less than 10 . 
  and that 's just talking about europe ; isis , boko haram and the taliban are losing territory in their areas of operations, 
  `` general who forgot military figures uses lunch instead '', 
  let the robots pay the robot tax , i pay the homer tax, 
   eritreans considering it 's such a small country and quite far away . 
  iirc it 's a dictatorship/one party state . 
  plus they 're not going to get any help from ethiopia or sudan ( who they went to war with ), 
   `` in a class in the city centre of my town , 91 % of the children are muslims . 
  ** obviously , this is a problem ** . '', 
   `` i just described the situation in my town . 
  ** it is not a value judgement ** , it 's a fact . '', 
  she was meeting with a religious leader though , and was acting as though the rules do n't apply to her . 
  if i walked into the vatican in a bikini would the pope be wrong for throwing me out ? 
  more surprising is kuwait being 14 % for le pen, 
  they expected le pen to win the first round and use that as a beating stick . 
  they know its now virtually impossible to win the second and so have lost everything, 
  why ? 
  but does n't czech come from the czech people aka bohemians . 
  also is n't bohemia `` czechy '' or something like that in czech ? 
  its more like calling the uk britain which many do, 
  it might move some, 
  she 's already got the money fraud bit down, 
  yeah fuck that [ auristocrat ] ( http://en.mediamass.net/people/emmanuel-macron/highest-paid.html ) macron and support the [ working woman ] ( http://en.mediamass.net/people/marine-le-pen/highest-paid.html ) le pen oh, 
  oh i know , i was disputing ops point that more muslim = more le pen voters, 
  paris ( with the highest number of muslim ) voted for macron . 
   eu flair he actually did it , the absolute madman, 
  so u/kinggeorgecommands when is that falir change coming ? 
  `` as a non french person , let me tell you french people why i know france better than you ... '', 
  im guessing you thought brexit was `` the will of the people '' despite being endosed by almost every paper in the uk, 
  you were n't saying that earlier, 
  melenchon vs le pen = eu referendum & / or frexit, 
  my sister 's 5th cousin went to malaga and saw an arab . 
  europe is dead !, 
  how can we when all the votes have n't been counted, 
  he does have good ideas on reforming the defecit, 
  they did the same after the dutch elections . 
  `` no see we still won becuase a right wing party ( who there already ) are in power ! '', 
  le pen is doomed to lose any second round, 
  fucking lizard people, 
   just the collaborating vichy scumbags . 
  you the fn founders ? 
  except if they 're alternative, 
  also many studies show that minority/immigrants birth rates drop after 2/3 generations to the same as the national average,

  til us northerns have our own patron saint, 
   do n't needlessly hurt anyone due their differences ' is sensible but it 's so obvious it does n't need to be said . 
  if it were there would n't be extreme nationalism, 
   i do n't think making sensible politic decision counts as being a pussy . 
  to normal people no but to trump supporters it is . 
  but surely banning it is also forcing women to dress a certain way . 
  im by no means a fan of islam but is n't this stance a little hypocritical ? 
  ( to be against forcing something by forcing the opposite ), 
  what ? 
  ukraine is entirely in europe and serbia is in the balkans, 
  i would just like to say that i was initially very confused as to why estonia was predicted to have 46 million in 2060 . 
  ukip is/was a single issue party whose single issue is done, 
  ok nevermind , you 're completely insane, 
  you there was a guy who suggested exactly what you want . 
  what was his name again ? 
  it was something german ... 
  badly, 
   far right is not about killing homosexuals ha !,
