tiny schling ? 
  lol , thanks . 
  i had food poisoning the other day and got about 3 hours sleep over the last 48 hours . 
  so please factor that into your calculations \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
  i honestly have no idea , i 'm really tired . 
  if i responded to the wrong person i apologise . 
  i imagine religion played a much bigger part in people 's lives back when the names of the week were being hashed out . 
  i guess the idea of a 7 day week , 6 normal days and a holy day is what stuck . 
  it 's the same in a lot of christian countries where sunday is considered a rest day and the day to go to church ( i think it 's called the sabbath ? ) . 
  jews have the same thing but their 24 hour period is from friday night to saturday night . 
  she could be a monkey with a hat on for all anyone cares . 
  the fact remains that this very obvious problem has a very obvious solution and she refuses to enact it . 
  as an asian and son of an immigrant who actually came over here and worked , i can tell you that they will can and have absolutely taken the piss . 
  it 's almost comical how much native europeans balk at the idea of doing something distasteful , despite its necessity . 
  you are n't going to achieve that for generations , they live in their little enclaves which are microcosms of their own societies back home and unless they 're forced to accept western ideals and ways of doing things , they 'll never change . 
  so you can see `` phone envy '' being a real thing but you ca n't fathom the idea that `` clothes envy '' is a real thing ? 
  interesting . 
  when you 're an adult , sure . 
  but when little timmy has those new # 70 nikes that came out last week and you 've got kangol 's it makes it fairly clear pretty quickly . 
  uniforms help eliminate that very visual factor of determining who is rich and who is poor . 
  also , a school is a place to learn and the clothing reflects that . 
  it 's like how clothes reflect the workplace ( jumpsuits , suit/tie , labcoat , etc ) , it puts you in the frame of mind for learning . 
  jesus christ stop replying . 
  i used reuters and the telegraph , not fox or cnn . 
  if you do n't know the difference , shut the fuck up . 
  everything you 've linked is about eyewitnesses ** recalling events ** . 
  that 's got nothing to do with a situation unfolding * right in front of them * . 
  you ca n't even link relevant counter-arguments . 
  you know what , since you 're incapable of walking away because as we 've established , you 're a massive fucking bitch , i will . 
  piss off . 
  [ as long as you believe that , lmao .

  jesus , you 're a massive bitch . 
  you can keep banging on about eye witnesses all you want , they 're still a primary source . 
   holy shit . 
  since when ?? 
  yeah , like i said , your mouth works faster than your head . 
  we 're done . 
  yeah , i 've we 've already covered that . 
  i can see reading or comprehension is n't your strong point . 
  the claim came from eye witnesses , a first hand account . 
  that 's called a `` primary source '' and is considered reliable unless proven otherwise . 
  maybe you should refrain from commenting on their level of journalism when you do n't understand how sources work . 
  [ but here , let me link another disreputable source . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-attack-iduskcn0y10hz ) lets just leave this conversation here . 
  especially seeing as you ca n't even name the last religiously motivated attack by a native european religion . 
  as a parting gift , i 'll give you a hint . 
  the catholics managed to put aside their differences with the protestants and not try to kill them for 15 years . 
  none of these are religious attacks ... are none of you capable of reading ? 
  do you all just have itchy fingers that you ca n't read to the end of a post without jumping the gun and posting irrelevant stuff ? 
  you did n't even order your list chronologically . 
  that 's just poor form . 
  lmao , the telegraph is a broadsheet . 
  they 're one of the most reliable papers out there . 
  if they report it , you can be 99 % sure it 's true until someone else says otherwise . 
  at the time we were also talking about a religious attack , something your breivik attack is n't . 
  since you enjoy being a pendatic about a situation that 's changed , at least be pedantic about the right this please . 
  do n't worry , i 'm not going to hold my breath for your answer . 
  i mean , you did n't even know who the telegraph were before calling them an disreputable source . 
  you may as well say reuters and getty images are n't trustworthy lol . 
  you did n't answer the question . 
  when was the last time . 
  give us a solid date instead of trying to beat your way around the point lol . 
  muslims have separated themselves into a hierarchy in very much the same way as the british class-system ( upper - middle - working ) . 
  tier 1 : middle eastern muslims . 
  tier 2 : central/south asian muslims . 
  tier 3 : sub-saharan african muslims . 
  those higher up the tiers look down their noses at at those lower down the tiers . 
  all the connotations that go with the different classes ( upper - middle - working ) are associated here as well due to how islam spread throughout the regions . 
  the tier 1 muslims see themselves as `` pure '' muslims where as tier 2 and 3 are converts and are hence of `` lower station '' . 
  saying it 's like `` sunni to sunni '' is like saying a kenyan is the same as an algerian , or a manc is the same as a londoner . 
  it just is n't even remotely true . 
  [ unfortunately , you lose this one . ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/22/shots-fired-at-munich-shopping-centre/ ) . 
  german-iranian shouting allahu ackbar lol . 
  `` ca n't be sure it 's muslims '' ... when was the last time you saw a white person do this in europe ? 
  do n't give me this shit lol . 
  deport those backwards fuckers . 
  that 's because the west has gotten so comfortable the current generation no longer knows what it means to deny another human something to ensure personal safety . 
  they ca n't say no to their kids having another bar of chocolate leading to epidemic levels of obesity , how the fuck are they gon na say no to some cunt from a religion that 's declared war on them immigrating ? 
  they literally ca n't . 
  they are frozen in inaction because they `` feel bad for them '' , lol . 
  bunch of pansies . 
   we should never normalize this or be any less shocked and this is why this shit flies in western europe . 
  all you do is be `` shocked '' instead of taking the hard line and fighting back . 
  the reason you can sit there in relative safety and be `` shocked '' is because people ( like the police ) put their lives on the line to combat this . 
  why do n't you get off your fucking arse and help * them * out by voting appropriately . 
  they should n't * have * to risk their lives by ** reacting ** to these situations when you can be ** proactive ** and nip this shit in the bud . 
  people 's inability to make the hard choice of `` i need to do this for my country '' and `` i feel bad for these immigrants , so i will put no restrictions because it 's hard for me to say no '' is what allowed this to happen in the first place . 
  it 's actually pathetic ... it 's like watching one of those friendzoned guys pine after a girl while he knows she 's being railed by another dude . 
  it 's actually scary that you think it 's normal for the police to raid your house for `` hate speech '' . 
  so much for just suing them for slander ... jesus . 
  germany , y' all crazy . 
  oh please , the eu is a poorly enacted version of the german unification of 1871 . 
  prussia unified several german states between 1815 and 1871 , that 's a period of 46 years in a time when they did n't have air transport or the internet . 
  the end-game of the eu was to create something similar , a large european bloc which acted as one nation instead of a confederation of smaller states . 
  before any of this immigration shit could have been seriously addressed , the primary aim should have been to solidify the union between member nations and move to unifying everyone under a single flag . 
  instead , countries went bankrupt , leaders engaged in dickwaving contests and voted for their own nations interests instead of moving towards the goal of unification and the white guilt that wracked the continent while spewing things like `` human rights of immigrants '' killed the plan before it took off . 
  hey , kind of like how the 1833 zollverein was a wash till they started looking past their own national interests !, 
  you ca n't just keep inviting everyone to join a union before the groundwork is laid , it 's premature . 
  who cares if turkey wants to join ?
