  seems like quite a harsh punishment . 
  really ? 
  $ 26 is less than half of what i got per week when i was on the dole in the uk three years ago . 
   a single european state is an unrealistic fantasy unrealistic in the near future , yes . 
  but your exact comment could have been made at some point for any state which currently exists on the planet . 
  right . 
  by ` slow things down ' , i did n't mean expansions ( although i think they should have happened more slowly ) , but just integration in general . 
  as i said , i 'm in favour of ` ever closer union ' myself , but that does n't mean i expect to see a single european state in my lifetime . 
  if we want to keep the majority of europe on board , i think we need to be careful to balance national considerations or we could sour the waters and end up moving backwards . 
  mhmm , personally i 'd be in favour of gradual federalisation , and i even think that most people could be won over if it happened smoothly and gradually enough , but you 're right that most people do n't feel that 's the right thing to do at the moment . 
  no , you 're right . 
  maybe what i really meant was no one i agree with politically criticises the eu ( for fear of being associated with the eurosceptic crowd ) . 
  i 'm not eurosceptic , but i 'm not deluded either . 
  things need to change in the eu . 
   you stole half your words from french so , you conquer us , rule us for around 400 years , and ** we 're ** the ones who stole ** your ** words !, 
  hardly seems fair . 
  the problem is that all the eurosceptic parties want to leave . 
  in the uk at least , there is n't really an debate around the eu , it 's either follow the euro-consensus or leave . 
  i 'd love it if we could remove any discussion of an exit and get down to the real job of criticising and reforming the union . 
   by excellence kind of ironically , given the debate , the way we say that in english is ` par excellence ' . 
  pretty much effing everything . 
  edit : this line refers to social attitudes , rather than government policy . 
  when i first read the question , i misunderstood what op meant by ` your country ' . 
  but seriously , i think we need significant renegotiation/restructuring of the eu . 
  in the long run , i would personally be in favour of a single european state , but i do n't think you can rush issues of cultural and economic integration . 
  i reckon the eu has already expanded too quickly and now we 're paying the price for that . 
  i hope we can slow things down a bit and keep everyone happy so that the project does n't fall apart , which would be a loss for the whole world , in my opinion . 
  `` its '' is the possessive form . 
  grammar is n't that hard , honestly . 
  cool . 
  i looked into it once and could n't even understand how to pluralise nouns . 
  yeah . 
  the thought of a foreigner learning polish !, 
  have you read the article you submitted ? 
  it 's in the uk . 
   republican what 's this got to do with the republicanism ? 
  i think doppinette was 12 millions high when they thought they needed to clarify this . 
  one answer to that is that in france they have a far more progresssive tax system , so when one area does well , the rest of france benefits along with it . 
  i would n't call london a parasite , but where i 've lived , in the north and wales , london feels quite far away , and its economic fortunes seem quite detached . 
  it 's not the efficient germans ' fault that they 've made it all the way to round two whilst you 're still lazing about in round one . 
   everything 's coming up ~ ~ uk ~ ~ london . 
   foretasted yum !, 
  which is why we ca n't into flag . 
  i think it 's something like ` rzshjechshzhpospolita ' . 
  it makes me sad to think that this is what many british people think of when they hear the word romanian . 
  i 'm a teaching assistant of an undergraduate maths course in a computer science department , and it 's a joke among the teaching staff that the romanian students are the only ones who will understand the more difficult/abstract parts of the course . 
  we have a lot of romanian students here and they are honestly amongst the best students we have . 
  i 'm not an expert in german politics , but i do n't think merkel is quite as detached from the lives of the commoners as cameron is . 
  at least they 're [ dogfooding ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eating_your_own_dog_food ) . 
  oh , so europe has n't had any violent religious or nationalist movements in modern times ? 
  why would you want to be culturally more similar to countries which make it quite clear to you that they 'll never accept you as ` civilised ' ? 
   ~ ~ moves ~ ~ reverts to rome, 
  because they have very few muslims living in their country ? 
  well , maybe things would be even worse if hungary were outside the eu now ... 
  but like i said , i 'm not claiming it 's the truth , just playing devil 's advocate . 
  wow , look at tunisia and morocco !, 
  i had thought that they were reasonably moderate countries ( by the standards of the region ) . 
  i suppose the map says nothing about which groups they 've gone to fight for , or what their reasons for going were though . 
  well , it 's possible that if europe had embraced turkey in the last few decades things like this would n't be happening now . 
  i 'm not saying this is the case , just that it 's possible . 
  sorry , it appears i can not read . 
   that said , economically russia has been far more successful under putin than under his predecessors . 
  i reckon he was just in the right place at the right time . 
  have you seen any evidence of his good management ? 
   putin does not want russia be like the west in any way . 
  so , rich ? 
  the future is bright for europe after all !, 
  right . 
  one of the ottoman sultan 's most important titles was caesar of rome . 
  and i thought the danes were supposed to be liberal !, 
  more like roly models , am i right ? 
  i think it 's just sad that instead of using the council of europe as a tool for putting pressure on governments to improve human rights and democratic freedoms , it seems to be used as a cover to legitimise the behaviour of dodgy regimes . 
  ah , thanks for the link . 
  i 'd had a quick google to try and back up my half-remembered knowledge , but had n't found anything . 
   at least you know quality if others produce it . 
  and is n't that something to be admired ? 
  taking the best from other countries is what gets you an empire , my son !, 
   ukip out of my coontrey yes , please !, 
  right . 
  i 'm just fed up of the british being bullied for our apparently terrible food , when i reckon you can find a wide range of delicious food in most british cities . 
  even if a lot of it is ` not british ' in origin ( although most of it does n't really resemble the ` original cuisine ' it derives from ) , i think it 's a product of the context of modern britain , and as such , we can claim it as the food of our nation !, 
  anyway , rant over . 
  it was just a silly jibe , meant in the same manner as quas4r 's comment . 
  if we ca n't make fun of each other , then what has europe come to ? 
   tanden as teeth interestingly , in persian it 's ` dandaan ' . 
  indo-european in action . 
   civilization is probably one of the most internationally used latin words . 
  i believe dutch is the only european language not to use a word derived from the greek ` mathematikos ' for mathematics ( wiskunde , related to the english ` wisdom ' , i think ) . 
  i 've heard it 's because of a period of dutch ` linguistic nationalism ' , in which they attempted to replace greco-latin terms with native dutch equivalents . 
  so do us welsh ... 
  it will always amuse me how europeans are so provincial about their food . 
  i suppose being closed to foreign influence is seen as a good thing these days . 
  i think the trimmings like yorkshire puddings , stuffing and gravy make it quite british . 
   we 're spending more on education than we have at any point in history . 
  i do n't have the figures at hand , this might be true . 
  but , it 's irrelevant to the fact that we 're giving young people more debt to study than ever before . 
  this naturally discourages the poorer in society from studying , and reduces their employment opportunities . 
   the nhs has not been privitised i did n't say it had been , but there is increasing privatisation , which i disagree with , because i believe that healthcare is n't something to be exploited for profit . 
   housing prices are naturally going to increase right , but are rates of home ownership naturally going to decrease over time ? 
  i hope not , but apparently we 're at a [ 25 year low ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/houseprices/10663923/rise-of-generation-rent-as-home-ownership-hits-25-year-low.html ) .
