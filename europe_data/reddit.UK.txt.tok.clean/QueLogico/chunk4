  spain too . 
  although it seems every spanish twenty-something is currently studying in britain , so i suppose this wo n't stay the case for long . 
   if they have children will they finally be allowed to say they 're europeans first ? 
  they have children . 
  you can see them in the documentary i linked to [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fuqay/van_driven_by_romanian_with_slogan_iran_is_great/ctsaqzx ) . 
  i do n't think it mentions what nationality they consider themselves though !, 
  press tv has a documentary about their trip around iran .

  liverpool itself is nice , so hopefully you 'll have a good time there !, 
  that 's the one . 
  i really hated that building when i was living there . 
  it 's ugly and noisy , but actually thinking about it now , it might be kind of nostalgic to go back and visit it . 
  i honestly expected it to be about the current vitriol between the tories and a resurgent left wing of the labour party . 
  i used to live right next to the huge catholic cathedral in liverpool and it was a nightmare on sunday mornings !, 
   not that i know , ego is as originally latin as in greek , as it comes from proto-indo-european * eghom . 
  yes , so it seems . 
  it was an honest mistake on my part !, 
  i see , thanks . 
  these kind of coincidences certainly pop up a lot with short words , but as i know turkish and persian have both influenced each other a lot ( despite being from different families as you said , and grammatically very different ) , i just wondered about it . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  i did n't realise that i 'd upset so many people by making a mistake about greek etymology !, 
  i am familiar with the concept of open and closed classes , but you 're right that i did n't know that any languages had pronouns as an open class , so til !, 
  oh , i 'm sorry , i misread the doubly-nested brackets . 
  where it says :  ( cognates : sanskrit aham , hittite uk , latin ego ( source of french je ) , greek ego , russian ja , lithuanian a\u0161 ) i did n't see the closing bracket after ` je ' . 
  [ this page ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ego#latin ) has the source as proto-italic though .

  `` man '' is `` i/me '' in persian , and has been since at least the [ manichaean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manichaean_alphabet ) period ( according to a book i 've got ) . 
  i wonder if it was borrowed into turkish . 
  i ca n't help thinking `` i '' is such a basic word it 's unlikely to be borrowed , but apparently it happened with `` ego '' from latin to greek , so i suppose it 's at least possible . 
  not according to [ this source ] ( http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=i ) . 
  edit : it turns out the source does n't say that . 
  see my comments below . 
  i 'm inclined to blame the french , for no good reason . 
   it 's full of party-political stooges who were appointed because of their political connections and donations . 
  and the saddest thing is , it 's * still * doing a better job than the commons . 
  to be honest , i think that the french-bashing is a fairly new thing . 
  of course at the national level there 's always been rivalry , but i think when it comes to people on the street , the irish are much more culturally known ( and thus mocked ) . 
  certainly when i was at school we had plenty of irish jokes and barely any idea france existed . 
  i disagree . 
  we do n't have any `` englishman , scotsman , frenchman '' jokes !, 
  i 'm british and i visited belfast recently and it was very nice and perfectly safe . 
  i did n't do much drinking though , i was more interested in walking around and seeing the sites . 
  right , but are they atheist catholics or atheist protestants ? 
  i went to belfast for the first time around christmas . 
  it was very nice actually , but it feels very different from any british city i 've visited . 
  there were a few things that made me feel rather uncomfortable ( flegs everywhere and five-metre-tall pictures of paramilitaries with assault rifles or the queen ) , but i personally never felt unsafe , despite being and sounding very british . 
  i heard some things from the locals that shocked me a bit as well . 
  for example , one young woman who worked in a shop asked me where i 'd been so far ; i said [ the falls road ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falls_road,_belfast ) and she casually mentioned that she 'd never been there , despite the fact it was about five minutes ' walk from where we were talking , because it would n't be safe for her as a protestant . 
  i had obviously read about and seen footage of the troubles and whathaveyou , but it 's much more real when you meet someone who lives in the united kingdom and has never felt safe to walk a few streets away from where they live . 
   armenia  these arab countries for the record , armenia is very much * not * an arab country . 
  they 're an indo-european people who have been a part of many empires , from roman , to persian , to arab , to turk , to russian , but of these , the arabs probably left the least of a cultural impact . 
  they 're an overwhelmingly christian population and armenia was the first nation to adopt christianity as a state religion . 
   woman walking down the streets of iran without wearing a niqab just for the record , iranian women do n't wear [ niqabs ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/1153402-3x2-940x627.jpg ) . 
  the [ hejab ] ( http://iranian.com/arts/2004/august/dress/images/13.jpg ) is mandatory , and the most conservative wear [ chadors ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8198/8219695111_7e8a5a4c52_z.jpg ) , but iranian women do n't cover their faces . 
  well , we have to counter this ignorance wherever we can , no matter how many americans we confuse . 
  the term ` asia ' was well-established for the eastern coast of the mediterranean before china was even known to exist !, 
  fun fact : contrary to what many modern ` turanists ' will tell you , the real turanians were actually an iranian people who lived in central asia before the turkish migrations . 
  it just shows how closely intertwined turkish and iranian cultures were that they wrote themselves into iranian creation myths . 
   some more european-like ` looking similar to europeans ' has nothing to do with being asian . 
  many ethnic groups in central and western asia are very similar to europeans , for example persians , kurds , caucasians , turkmens and even some afghans and north indians . 
  that does n't mean they 're ` less asian ' than the chinese . 
   the country they left has no obligation to re-accept them then the country they arrived at ( italy et al ) also has no obligation to accept them for the same reason ? 
  it was forced collaboration . 
  they 're still used in britain , fwiw . 
  i think the point of the phrase is that it sounds very deep and dramatic , but actually describes something completely mundane : every day is the first day of the rest of your life . 
  indeed it is . 
  i only added the ' / s ' because i did n't want people to think that i was implying it was better because it was in europe . 
  i visited this year , so i 'm doing my bit . 
  it was nice , especially the food and the architecture , but i wish turks would tone it down a bit on the sales tactics . 
  for example , i know that there are tables in restaurants where i can sit and eat , i do n't need you to stand outside and tell me , even if we are friends ( apparently ) . 
  the better half !, 
  well , as i 'm british , i pronounce it the same way as you , but since it 's a contraction of `` vital minerals '' , actually the american pronunciation makes more sense ... 
   literally no difference in grammar well , off of the top of my head , i can think of a couple interesting differences . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_american_and_british_english ) has some on this page , but luckily the government is n't trying to legislate on it . 
  i could care less myself , from the theoretical perspective , but oftentimes in practice i find americanisms jarring . 
  i 'm sure i 've heard a joke about american english being the result of germans learning to speak from the irish , or something . 
   le france this bothers me far more than it should . 
  it 's ` la france ' . 
  so , that 's basically decided then . 
  `` the markets '' have spoken . 
  ah , that could be it . 
  i 'll reserve my judgment until i can find some real gouda gouda then . 
  hey , cheese is one of the few foods i 'd consider the english to be good at !, 
  maybe not quite as good as the french , but certainly better than the dutch ( gouda * is * terrible ) . 
   would you mind explaining why these anti-eu-feelings are boiling up every two years or so ? 
  i wish i could , but it 's a bit of a mystery to me too . 
  as i see it , we ca n't really use ` cultural ' explanations . 
  it 's true that english people are relatively unlikely to know a second language or work and live in another eu member state , so they 're less likely to have those kind of connections to other states , but that 's also true of the irish and the scottish , both of whom are far more pro-eu . 
  on the other hand , i 'm not convinced , as we can see written on this sub quite regularly , that the british want their empire back or anything like that , at least not the majority of people , but i think this does come closer to the truth . 
  the british are fiercely independent and proud - i would even say nationalistic , although a lot of my countrymen would disagree with that simply because we do n't wave flags . 
  indeed , this is one of the things that has made britain powerful . 
  however , it 's clear from looking at most forms of international comparison that britain is no longer a ` great power ' in the world , and i think this is particularly difficult for our ruling class to accept . 
  the eu represents this new state of affairs , where britain is just one of many and has to follow the rules like everyone else , so our ` establishment ' has a difficult time coming to terms with it . 
  this comment is a bit incoherent , but i hope it helps . 
  just wait until the public learn how much we get bashed by mainlanders on reddit , then they 'll change their minds !, 
  ( this is a joke ; i hope we can end all of these exit debates and live happily together in the eu . ), 
  it 's not his fault . 
  my browser does that when i type in a right-to-left script too and i 'm not sure why .
