  who says we want democracy , i trust queenie far more than i trust my fellow voter . 
  why on earth would anyone want to do that ? 
   parliament could take away her ability to do that ( but it would require the actual consent of the lords ) are you sure ? 
  that does n't sound right , the queen is above parliament . 
   ( although , that was predictable and quite obvious ) . 
  was it ? 
  no one i knew saw it coming . 
  a prime ministerial resignation has n't happened for decades . 
  they 'd have to weigh that up against how important it is to have the uk in the eu . 
  which is quite important , whether most people want to admit it or not . 
  we have n't triggered article 50 though . 
  nah , i 'm sure we 'll work out another special snowflake agreement . 
  we 'd probably offer to rejoin with the same deal we had before . 
  if we actually end up leaving , that is , which we probably wo n't . 
  and ruin their relations with the uk ? 
  highly unlikely . 
  so just a semi-flying pig then . 
  we keep finding more oil and better ways to extract it though . 
  50 years ago we thought we only had 30 years of oil left , but here we are . 
  also the demand is slowly dropping as we develop other energy sources . 
  i 'm implying that a lot of people panic-sell in these situations which drives the price down . 
  this happens all the time with stocks and currencies . 
  something bad happens , price ticks down , goes back to normal quite quickly . 
  do you seriously think that the pound is worth 11 % less just because of the referendum ? 
  the drop in the pound will only be temporary . 
  legally they do but they are in no logical position to do so . 
  do n't forget `` gosh '' and `` blimey '' . 
  also , lol at the ** one ** guy who made an invalid/blank vote , 
  wow , 98.9 % . 
  is that a world record for a referendum to have such a high majority ? 
  yeah , was gon na say i 've never seen anyone take a problem with any flag in the uk . 
  is that any good ? 
  was thinking about getting it but was n't too impressed with the first one . 
  just seemed like a bad gta clone with some hacking shoehorned in . 
  i voted remain but i 'm starting to think the leave vote was worth it if only to teach people a lesson about democracy . 
  every election has `` manipulation '' to some degree . 
  accept it . 
  yeah , funny how the guardian pushes their political agenda by complaining at the ways the other side pushes their political agenda . 
  i 'm not a dude , and i did n't mean it as an insult there either . 
  now , the word `` retarded '' was an insult yes , 
  one such example being earlier in this very comment chain , 
  in what way is it an insult ? 
  wow , since when is `` leftist '' a banned word ? 
  what do you propose instead ? 
  are you talking about abortion ? 
  sorry to tell you , but the government paying for your abortion is not a right . 
  that is not a natural right , it is a legal right . 
  * technically * you 're correct saying that it is a right , but when most people talk about rights they are talking about [ natural rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_and_legal_rights ) - otherwise you could argue that literally any law is a restriction on people 's rights , which is rather silly . 
  for instance , i could claim that laws against murder were violating women 's rights , since if not they would have a legal right to murder people and that would take that away . 
  certainly i would not consider the right to have the government pay for your abortion part of women 's rights . 
  * maybe * at a stretch you could claim that the right to have an abortion is a right , but i would disagree that as well ( for the record , i am totally pro-choice . 
  i just do n't think you are using `` women 's rights '' correctly here ) . 
  wait , not wanting the government to pay for abortions is against women 's rights now ? 
  or is there something else i 'm missing ? 
  i 'm glad we agree that the leftist movement in the uk is being foolish by wanting to disassociate with trump . 
  just out of interest , are you in favour of trump being permitted to speak in the house of commons on his state visit to the uk ? 
  in what way is that hypocritical ? 
  she is not willing to accept the customs of a country , so she declined to visit it . 
  that 's exactly what she wants migrants thinking of coming into france to do , is it not ? 
  if she insisted on visiting but not wearing the headscarf , that would be hypocritical . 
  i too agree . 
  it 's a wonder why le pen is doing a better job of standing up for women 's rights than a lot of leftist politicians , especially sweden 's government which explicitly claims to be feminist . 
  they could have declined to visit , like le pen did . 
  i agree . 
  it 's nice to see her standing up for women 's rights . 
  ah , i did n't see that . 
  thanks . 
  hmm . 
  interesting that that survey does n't appear to take into account violence against men . 
  i do n't find that very useful in that case . 
  that 's a good point . 
  i ca n't find any statistics for percentage of incidences of sexual harassment reported by country though . 
  i would assume that they used the same definition of sexual harassment in each country , but the article does n't say anything about that so you may be right . 
  that 's just short of $ 1000 per day pre-tax ... how is it possible to live paycheck to paycheck on that , even in a high cost of living area !, 
  i do n't know , but i 'm going to guess it means `` toaster '' . 
  nah fuck that , do n't give them what they want . 
   obama has to share a lot of that power with others well , he does n't anymore . 
  alright . 
  i have my doubts as to whether we will actually agree on that but worth a try i suppose . 
  1 year was he wrong about trump ? 
  piss off with the alarmism . 
  one day there will be a real fascist rising to power and no one will take you seriously because you said the same thing about trump . 
   its not alarmist anymore to say that a soft coup is likely happening right now in my country right now lol yes it most certainly is, 
  him activating it on day 1 would have been illegal as we just found out . 
  islamic terrorism ** is ** far right terrorism . 
  islamist ideals are about as far right as you can get . 
  canada is still ours . 
  do n't tell the canadians though , 
  source ? 
  sure , at first it will be articles with blatant falsehoods . 
  then articles which go against the mainstream media . 
  then articles that the government does n't like . 
  giving the government total control over the media is just not a good idea . 
  you think everyone who is worried about a literal ministry of truth is trolling ? 
  that 's pretty stupid of you . 
  why do you think the conservatives promised a referendum ? 
  because lots of people cared and ukip were sucking up the euroskeptic vote . 
  `` independent '' is a word that is viewed positively , which would make people more inclined to vote for it . 
  same reason polls with `` yes/no '' answers tend to slightly favour the yes option . 
  the question should be : should scotland leave the uk or remain in the uk ?
