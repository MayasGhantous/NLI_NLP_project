  not `` reverse-racist '' . 
  just racist . 
  they are centuries ahead of us ... 
  oh shit i never thought about that !, 
  maybe the muslims have it right after all !, 
  high heels are n't healthy ? 
  really ? 
  shit ... 
  but also the pressure to wear high heels is n't nearly as much as the pressure to wear one of those things . 
  i feel i can wear flat shoes pretty much anytime except for a very formal setting and be fine . 
  those looks like weird and highly ineffective radiation suits . 
  provide proof then . 
  otherwise that is the very definition of talking bs . 
  `` oh my gosh , something vaguely pertaining to trump !, 
  must find something to say that makes him look bad ! '', 
  i would n't say triggered , it 's just a sad reminder of what muslim women are forced to do . 
  really ? 
  i mean i like older woman but ... no way, 
  hmm . 
  i 'm of the opinion that all ladies should wear skirts , but idk if i 'd want to see the unfuckable lard arse in one : /, 
  kek, 
  i do n't care . 
  a vote for labour is a vote for corbyn , and i shall not be doing that . 
   and the ability to be able to threaten to murder tens of millions of innocent civilians despite the fact that we never would do it anyway . 
  that 's a funny way of saying `` our ultimate line of defense against any existential threat to our nation '' . 
  and fuck yeah we would use it , maybe a complete and utter coward like corbyn would n't but from what past prime ministers have said , they would absolutely use them if they felt they were necessary . 
   the interests that matter to you are preservation of a system whereby legal superiority to you is assigned by birth to some incest created chinless wonder that 's a funny way of saying `` a huge part of our culture and heritage , as well as a balance against the democratically elected government in case it were to try and do an erdogan '' . 
  well i 'm sorry that your country 's education system has failed to teach you basic common sense and manners . 
  if you do not know somebody 's gender , the polite and sensible thing to do is to use a gender neutral term such as `` they '' or `` it '' . 
  cheers,

  it does n't matter , either way we will win . 
  i 'm not happy about the conservatives but i do n't have a choice , there are interests which i have that only they are willing to represent . 
  if it was completely irrelevant , why would n't you use a gender-neutral term ? 
   abolish the monarchy , are you smoking some special brand of daily express crack ? 
  looks like you did n't check to see if you were right before talking down to others . 
  do n't you look stupid now ... :( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jeremy-corbyn-what-a-pity-labours-new-leader-is-a-tongue-tied-republican-a6689341.html https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/24/fallon-brands-corbyn-security-risk-on-trident-and-drone-strikes  fellow nope !, 
  how dare you assume my gender ( but unironically ) . 
  wow , every assumption you made in your post was wrong , how embarrassing that must be for you . 
  i do n't know where you live but i get 76mb/s in norwich ( small city , and i do n't even live in the city centre ) . 
  who else can i vote for ? 
  labour , who wants to get rid of our nuclear weapons , take in syrian `` refugees '' and abolish the monarchy ? 
  liberal democrats , who also want to take in refugees , are self-proclaimed globalists ( well , they say `` internationalists '' , but it 's the same thing ) , and want to reduce albeit not get rid of our nuclear weapons ? 
  ukip ... heh , this is / r/europe , you know all about them . 
  the greens , who claim to be for the environment yet support abolishing nuclear power ? 
  also they want to spend far too much of other people 's money . 
  it 's not that i * want * to vote conservative , it 's that i have no choice . 
  err we have good internet over here . 
  not the best but there is nothing wrong with it at all . 
  is it ? 
  huh , my french teacher in high school said that i was lucky to have learnt english as a first language as it is very difficult . 
  i guess she lied , the bastard !, 
  the leaks were n't even done by us :p, 
  not all of us actually even like le pen . 
  i dropped support of her once i found out she was against gay marriage . 
  genuine question : if they were all russian bots , why would their french be so much worse than their english ? 
  she was against brexit . 
  not just any mod either !, 
  i am head mod , 
  wow , really ? 
  i thought it was tomorrow ... 
  well , the actual french media are blacked out from reporting on election stuff , so yeah . 
  repealing tax breaks for home owners ? 
  why would you want tax breaks for home owners ... that would just mean that everybody who does n't own a home subsidises those who do . 
  surely it is good for equality to repeal that , since poor people are unlikely to own homes ... ? 
  as for trumpcare , it seems pretty good to me -- pregnancy not being covered makes a lot of sense because that is something people choose to do , and it 's great for me as a childless person . 
  as an aside , this also greatly benefits the lgbt community , who are less likely to become pregnant . 
  are n't they against illegal immigration ? 
  i have read many news stories this week . 
  i 've not heard of trump trampling on anyone . 
  just doing my civic duty . 
  oh , i 'm aware of it , i 'd just like to hear it in your words . 
  seeing as you are making accusations against her . 
  thanks !, 
  i am colourblind, 
  what has she said about muslims ? 
  oh , apologies , the highlighting for the op is a similar colour to that of a mod comment . 
  why do n't you just vote according to current policy ? 
  she is not her father . 
  what you are doing is like when people criticised hillary clinton for the actions of her husband , but i 'm sure you were n't ok with that . 
  do the mods of / r/europe have the right to decide what is and is n't disinformation ? 
  did you remove his comment because it goes against your narrative ? 
  removing someone 's post and telling them to post on a right wing sub because people agree with them there is worrisome . 
  and it 's been half a century since fn was founded . 
  why the double standard ? 
  this is interesting : https://diversitymachtfrei.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/macron-leaks-contain-secret-plans-for.html, 
  ah , but you see , it 's alright in that case because ** le pen is a nazi reeeeeeeeeeee **, 
  you mad ? 
  the democratic party in the us used to be pro-slavery . 
  i 'm curious , does that mean that the republican party is the only sensible choice over there ? 
  and you can pretend that your preferred candidate is n't not only complicit but [ actively in support of the muslim invasion ] ( https://diversitymachtfrei.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/macron-leaks-contain-secret-plans-for.html ) , at least according to the leaks . 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
   all those poor , sick and disabled people who get trampled on in the mean time ? 
  what policy has trump enacted that `` tramples on '' poor , sick , and/or disabled people ? 
  yeah most of us use both . 
  though there are some 8chan purists among us , 
  liking le pen is trolling ... ? 
   the war economy that probably had to do with them actually being at war rather than the ethics of their government . 
   pushing conservative values not really ... 
  they encouraged people to have a lot of children because they needed soldiers to fight with , but that 's about it , and again it was done out of `` necessity '' .
