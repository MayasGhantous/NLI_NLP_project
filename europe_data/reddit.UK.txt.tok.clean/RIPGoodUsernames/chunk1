the old world was as multicultural as today 's , if not more . 
  nah , none at all man . 
  yep , it 's is fucking horrible , at least in scotland we have the ** s ** ingle ** t ** ransferable ** v ** ote which can briefly be described as a mixture of ** f ** irst ** p ** ast ** t ** he ** p ** ost and ** p ** roportional ** r ** epresentation . 
  pretty much each area there will be a guy who gets elected from fptp and another guy who got elected through pr . 
  it 's really fucking complicated though , but it works , so yeah . 
   10 % http://i.imgur.com/pymkpxj.png i 'll have you know , from the top of my head , it was 12.6 % !,

  his xenophobia runs deep . 
  top kek, 
  sorry , i mean students from other countries . 
  just as i mean tourists from other countries . 
  my bad . 
  a lot of people in are n't citizens . 
  students , some immigrants , tourists . 
  an increase in population should lead to a higher gdp , this is not per capita . 
  is that not true ? 
  a lot of the time the french army is deployed in africa . 
  it 's from a yougov survey , i do n't know why ,, 
  ok non-country . 
  damn people !, 
  they ruined britain !, 
  thanks for your insight . 
  yes , pretty much no politician here ( even farage ) wants to stop immigration . 
  why ca n't le pen win by simply saying that the country is going on the wrong track and going against immigration ? 
   you 're a appetite ? 
  what a tune . 
  so fat shaming * works ?? 
  * who knew !, 
  feelsflabman,

  i thought it was windmill jews . 
  march 15th 2017 `` do n't trust the pollsters '', 
  it 's remind, 
  idk i thought it was a reputable website . 
  in scotland that 's either a bread roll , a morning roll or just a fucking roll . 
  damn it , you caught me . 
  i voted to leave , i support trump . 
  you could call me alt-right . 
  but picking a fight with people on a subreddit like this is autistic . 
   this sub do n't be delusional , that 's an easy way to get hate . 
   `` hurr durr eu is the best hurr durr  the eu is a titanic failure . 
  do n't be overly melodramatic , come on . 
  see the source [ here ] ( https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/political-regime-updated2016 ) . 
  you guys were a democracy from 1917 ( fall of czarist russia ) to 1931 ( ban on communist parties ? 
  not sure ) . 
  do n't be a cunt . 
  thanks for the criticism , / u/jewcunt . 
  full disclosure , the data is n't oc , this is from this site : https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/political-regime-updated2016 i just screencapped this frame , thought it would be interesting for you guys . 
   old school socialists those tend to be eurosceptic pal, 
  why ? 
  i do n't know man , there was an 8 mile lorry tailback in kent , so yeah , they were . 
  i 've been to florida , stayed there with relatives . 
  things are way worse . 
  not even kidding . 
   nice europe we are heading toward if germany and austria i do n't see countries like norway or big countries like the uk doing this . 
   implying the uk gets much eu funding, 
  he got away with it in 2015 mind you . 
   no english t-r-i-g-g-e-r-e-d, 
   must be hard being french , being irrelevant compared to the germans and having lost the language fight to the english . 
  alright , which frog took a shit in your coffee ? 
  you do n't have to pay me to go against france !, 
  why ? 
  the independent is leftist . 
   what better things are there to spend money on than infrastructure , education and helping out those in need ? 
  paying down the deficit so that when a crash happens ( we are actually due one ) shit wo n't hit the fan ? 
  also , it is a conservative government in power , they always reign in spending . 
  usually cut taxes too . 
   staunchly opposed to any kind of intervention . 
  he and his party are pushing to intervene in syria , you know that ? 
  then i guess it is an in !, 
  murdoch , the ft , the i and the guardian are all for staying in . 
   austrians and hungarians are n't even closely related . 
  uhhh, 
  ok , since most of them have touchscreen phones they can google a street name in aleppo . 
  or the smugglers can give them one . 
  oh come on , the refugees are n't that daft . 
   `` ok , so what part of aleppo was your favorite before the war ? '', 
   `` the city center where all the shops are . '', 
   which should be easy enough to prove . 
  how ? 
  scroll down [ here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11599609/asylum-figures-take-centre-stage-in-new-eu-negotiations.html ) . 
  i know the title triggered you though . 
  syrians are the biggest group yes , but to say  the vast , vast majority of refugees in europe are indeed syrian is a lie . 
  in the future i can see more ` syrians ' coming because germany has granted them a home there . 
  so anyone from the middle east can throw away their papers and say they are syrian now . 
  only a [ third ] ( http://puu.sh/jsxa8/baf92537fa.png ) are . 
   got any real examples of racism on the sub ? 
  oh come on dude , even in this thread there is a shit ton . 
  most of it has been nuked , though . 
   and that 's despicable how ? 
  it is n't . 
  i admire them for that . 
  but we ca n't take everyone . 
  if we take but a few low skilled workers we get overpopulation ( not really in scotland , but in england ) , wage depression ( british workers are usually in some form of union and wo n't accept crap pay ) , and pressure on public services ( we have an open door to most of europe so we ca n't really plan for the future ) and worst of all , more people will want to arrive .
