  that means more boat deaths , more riots and more loss of life in general . 
  i would rather they stayed in their home countries ( most of the time ) and tried to built it up . 
  much like those of your country , and look at where it is now . 
  i am mixed race myself , so i really disagree with your last point . 
  gee , i wonder why we are wary . 
  not like there has been ~ ~ 10 ~ ~ 11 islamic attacks involving deaths in recent history . 
  8 years of knee-jerk reactions , folks . 
   plus it 's just a wales jab for no reason in particular . 
  maybe because wales is the nearest thing to southern england ? 
   his does n't need to be stated , its mandatory . 
  reddit is a private company , they can do whatever the fuck they want . 
   they only did it once . 
  uhh, 
  sorry - my mistake . 
  not one edit . 
  at least make it look like you give a shit . 
  aaand this post has been delisted . 
  ca n't take a bit of sarcasm , lad ? 
  sorry , i was being sarcastic , megathreads are a pile of horseshit , allow upvotes to decide and if it gets too out of hand step in . 
  or just add a bloody filter . 
  it takes 30 seconds in css . 
  pcmr has one , / r/buildapc has one , / r/worldnews has one , most big subs have one . 
  top banter . 
  2 for wan deal on these people !, 
  [ this thread ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0e5_1439474009 ), 
  more multikulti !, 
  lol / u/romebeach is red pilled .

  never heard of such a thing . 
  it is on for existing customers with sky , but a simple dns change or vpn will bypass it . 
  in london the money spent per head on infrastructure is # 400 per head . 
  in liverpool - it is # 10 . 
  i tend not to post in / r/coontown as a non-white myself . 
  that is what / r/european tried to do . 
  1 year got them 5k subs .

   i may need my tinfoil hat for this a very big one , at that . 
  oh goodness , the irony !, 
  if you look at it that way then i understand . 
  i still think you should pick holes in his argument on xenophobia rather than this . 
  c'mon , i consider myself a nationalist but not all migrants are criminals , not even close . 
  that is pretty childish . 
  if you want to go down this route , i could say ` when you heard migrant swarm you thought of insects , how very racist of you ! ', 
  but i would n't . 
  that is childish . 
  words have different meanings in some cases ? 
  i 'm not sure if you are n't a native speaker or not , but in english there are thousands of words with more than one meaning . 
  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/swarm notice point 3, 
   have had more people kicked out for being racist than all of the other parties put together . 
  i know this is satire , but [ it is untrue .

  no , the vibe i am getting is that you are saying is ' i do n't care ' so i think it is meaningful for you to comment . 
  again , not a mod here . 
  if i was , i 'd have banned you already in typical form . 
  so you 're saying ` i 'm not a mod , i do n't care ' ? 
  just do n't comment then . 
   since i do n't know that users comment history by heart or maybe you type / u/im _ a_pig ???? 
  there are no personal attacks . 
  take 15 seconds of your time before commenting , please . 
  the statistics i looked up are [ here ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ita:rus:esp:gbr:deu:fra:jpn:can:usa&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=649119600000&amp;tend=1406502000000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) which showed russia being 8th at the time of the soviet unions collapse in 1991 . 
  please do n't attack me before looking at the world bank 's statistics first . 
   i 'm not sure if the comment made is a bannable offense . 
  i do n't know , i think you can find the rules to the right . 
  ( it is not , as i said before )  it sure is something everybody knows can get you in trouble though so maybe ... just do n't be a jerk to people and if you are , refrain from using swear words . 
  it 's not rocket science now , is it ... for sure . 
  i think his comment was uncalled for . 
  no way . 
  i was getting my data [ here ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ita:rus:esp:gbr:deu:fra:jpn:can:usa&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=649119600000&amp;tend=1406502000000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) which showed it as russia being 8th at the time of collapse . 
  sorry if i came off as rude . 
   1.2 personal attacks that do not add any substance to a conversation will be de-listed [ removed ] . 
  if this continues a ban may be placed . 
  he has n't did it many times . 
  he was also responding to a comment that did not add any substance to the conversation . 
  germany . 
  japan .

   bremen = democratic republic of congo kek, 
  [ / r/european post here ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3ew60v/for_what_i_got_banned_on_reurope_yesterday_on_the/ ) , i suppose / u/whenthepostmanring was right all along :p, 
  they just banned op . 
  - t-r-i-g-g-e-r-e-d -, 
  none . 
  okay , for some reason i thought it was a cross because a big battle ( downvotes and upvotes ) had raged . 
  i 'm retarded . 
  at least it makes sense . 
  it is also two words with alliteration , hardly a mouthful . 
  then why do n't they tag it as such ? 
  the current situation is stupid . 
   \\ #bettertogethor was the campaign title of the no side in the scottish referendum campaign . 
  that campaign was seen as a disaster take it from me , the name had nothing to do with it . 
  for a second there i thought that was the whole of ukraine . 
   your you 're,
