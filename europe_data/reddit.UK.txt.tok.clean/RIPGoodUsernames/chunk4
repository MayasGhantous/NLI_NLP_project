   uk defending its territory . 
  gibraltar is not . 
   it 's a british overseas territory ?? 
  haters gon na hate, 
  haters gon na hate , man !, 
  no , i do n't think it is an effective solution and i disagree with it , but you can see their logic there . 
  what about west thrace ? 
  scotland too ? 
  if these people were not here we would not have this problem . 
  seems like a solution to me . 
  gallon is a northern english name . 
  the times ? 
  very slightly right wing . 
  the economist is not unbiased. , in that the solution to every problem is more liberal free trade internationalism . 
  they will never call for protectionism and will always call for fewer immigration laws . 
  a good read , but not unbiased . 
  lmao i thought they were saying `` netherlands '', 
  refugee quotas, 
  i think so but they do n't get back as much as other countries like france . 
  13th in the eu is n't really `` richest '' . 
   especially since italy is n't one if the richest countries in the eu, 
  he means it pays in a lot to the eu budget and does n't get much bad , especially since italy is n't one if the richest countries in the eu like germany or sweden is . 
  yeah i usually do n't browse / r/europe , i stick to / r/ukpolitics and game subreddits . 
  it is new to me sorry . 
   apartheid what, 
  holy shit 2 % ? 
  which is far left . 
  far left used to be commies but they are gone now . 
  pula means cock in romanian . 
  wow . 
  some pretty big mental gymnastics there, 
  shitty scale , impossible to read . 
   the german land would still be scattered into hundreds of tiny princedoms . 
  no , napoleon dismantled the holy roman empire . 
  there were 39 states or so in bismark 's time . 
  cmon , theyre some tanks that look cool . 
  like the one in berlin . 
   ** usa ** joined war as soon as poland was invaded you 're talking about more than european theatre buddy . 
  damn , did n't know that . 
  they started a war against the soviets with the help of ukrainians and lithuanians , but in turn annexed vilno and ukraine remained communist . 
  semantics . 
  yeah iirc the closest airfield was in italy and the raf ( with many polish airmen ) ran hundreds of sorties to warsaw over nazi-occupied land to help . 
  i 'm sure these supplies did n't help much . 
  yeah , the soviets only started helping by air from the 14th september , by that time the uprising had clearly failed . 
  the army just sat there , i suppose hoping the germans would be softened up . 
  mulberry takes kebab, 
  he is clearly joking . 
  we are an island , it is pretty hard to enter unless it is your real identity . 
   tfw when, 
  i got 33/40 just from playing eu4 . 
  i do n't see how this is difficult for anyone . 
  i 'm pretty sure the wikipedia page for denmark has most of the answers . 
  i think he is making a joke based on wales . 
  nah , they had cut down lots of the nearby trees and put up wires around the nearby paths in though . 
  i got away fine . 
  i wanted to make one of these `` best day of my life '' posts but my country 's borders have barely fucking changed in the last 1000 years . 
  yup , just cycled home and had a knife pulled on me by some gypsies , no joke . 
  it was in a disused industrial estate though , so i suppose it 's kinda my fault . 
  found the guy who does n't live near gypsies . 
  how can you come to that conclusion ? 
  holy shit dude, 
  https://www.destatis.de/de/publikationen/thematisch/bevoelkerung/migrationintegration/auslaendbevoelkerung2010200167004.pdf?__blob=publicationfile fake ? 
  https://www.destatis.de/de/publikationen/thematisch/bevoelkerung/migrationintegration/auslaendbevoelkerung2010200167004.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ah yes , dubious . 
   independent, 
   for us tanks are pretty meaningless and would be great waste of money given our geographical location . 
  huh , what do you mean ? 
   basil ii he was literally known as the bulgar slayer . 
  i suppose he means `` in stead '' rather than `` in favour '' . 
  men are more likely to bust their ass doing over time . 
  the hundreds of thousands of indians , pakistanis , bangladeshis , nigerians , poles , franks , romanians , bulgars , italians , and spaniards . 
  they might not all be native but they still live here . 
   implying the earth is round, 
  becuase lots of people in the british isles are neither anglo nor celtic . 
   less than 300e to over 500e in 5 years this is mostly because lots of romanian electricians have move to western europe where you can get 3000e a month . 
   literally nothing  british destroyers have a combat range of a few hundred more miles thus protecting more convoys and saving probably thousands of lives . 
  as i said , it is understandable and certainly advantageous that you guys stayed neutral and did n't wish to cooperate with the uk and relations were bad , but to say that you could do nothing is just wrong . 
   ottomans were effectively invincible https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vaslui, 
  for one , let the british navy resupply and take safe harbour at your ports . 
  the irish staying neutral is understandable , but do n't act as if your country was useless and incapable of helping defeat the nazis . 
  not really , my boys the komnenids took back most of what was lost . 
  i must thank my main man anthemius for spending nine years building the walls of constantinople . 
  at that time the uk navy was bigger than americas , i 'm sorry to say . 
   on a goddam island . 
  so was the uk, 
  i 'm pretty sure it is mutual . 
  last time macron crushed his hands . 
  i must thank my man theodosius for spending nine years building the walls of constantinople . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_varna https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_battle_of_kosovo, 
  #ottoman cannons ca n't breach theodisian walls # wake up sheeple, 
  there is a quote from micheal gove ( one of the leaders of brexit campaign ) '' ** the people of this country have had enough of experts ** from organisations with acronyms , saying that they know what is best , and getting it consistently wrong . '', 
  the interviewer interrupted him after his initial quote . 
  that is a bit of a mouthful though . 
  the british army had 300,000 troops total in 1939 , spread all across the empire . 
  i do n't know what you wanted britain to do ? 
  thought you had a polish flag and wrote a massive blog about how gustavus wrecked poland, 
  thanks, 
   glasgow region light green nah . 
   fun fact : the northern isles ( orkney and shetland ; the islands shown at the top of each map are the orkneys while the shetlands are further north ) * never * spoke scottish gaelic wrong . 
  they spoke gaelic before the viking invasions for the early middle ages . 
  some even say it was spoken in caithness as late as the 1400s .
