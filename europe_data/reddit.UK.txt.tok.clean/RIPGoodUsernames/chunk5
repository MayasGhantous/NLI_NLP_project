  the 2011 census has it declining by 1,000 people able to speak gaelic too . 
  :( [ long term table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fziazeq.png ) the main reason for this decline was the education act of 1872 which meant that gaelic was banned in the classroom . 
  children even received beatings for speaking gaelic to classmates . 
  there are [ some revival efforts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vcjspld.png ) , but it is very slow and will never return gaelic to what it once was . 
  this map seems to have the yellow colour as meaning 20-40 % speakers and orange as 40-75 % with red being  75 % . 
  a detailed map of gaelic speakers in 2011 can be seen [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/scots_gaelic_speakers_in_the_2011_census.png ), 
  * screams in pictish *, 
   gdl stands for `` grand duchy of lithuania '' for anyone who does n't know . 
  communist-tier national anthem right there . 
  your wages are terrible in comparison to western europe though , you can earn more on unemployment benefits in some places . 
  i remember someone making a really detailed analysis but i believe the summary of it is that too many companies are owned by small families who do n't wish to grow and expand it as much as other countries in europe . 
  i 'm sure if you googled it you would get a better picture . 
  my boy america doing the best . 
  never on the mainland though . 
  well , the term itself does n't make sense , not really a meme . 
  also because of the jewish collaboration with the communists . 
  outnumbered 10:1 , still managed to kill 1:1 . 
  seems alright . 
  no madison ivy for melanie ? 
  really ? 
  can you give me some source/links to this ? 
  i 've been an avid user of the sub for a few years and seen none of the sort https://web.archive.org/web/20160615074005/https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/ https://web.archive.org/web/20160621105439/https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/ one top article is about defending freedom of movement , then something about more cuts if the uk votes to leave . 
  the second link shows a risk to universities being at risk if brexit happens . 
   r/ukpolitics which is pro-brexit ( or at least was , till reality sunk in ) ???????? 
  it was never pro-brexit . 
  the polls on there gave remain a lead . 
  why would you say something like this ? 
  you can go to the sub right now and see . 
  my limited irish tells me something about `` slavery language of the island '' or some shit, 
  the alliance goes all the way back to the crusades , it was only formally ratified 631 years ago . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_ottoman_empire#1914_ottoman_census sorry , buddy . 
  mind you , it was greek for most of the 4000 years before it . 
  my boy scanderbeg !, 
  step it up boys, 
  calm down pawel , i 'm sure he is joking . 
  in fairness , he posted that 30 seconds after you posted the translation . 
  there was no flair and no comment when he clicked the link . 
  for sure . 
  but we are on an english speaking forum right now . 
  actually , switserland is the afrikaans word . 
  dutch is just `` zwitserland '', 
  that defines poverty as earning < $ 2 a day . 
  so people earning $ 0 a day but with enough food are counted as in extreme poverty . 
  fyi , it is spelt switzerland . 
  yep , probably . 
   n. ireland should n't even exist . 
  it 's a uk-wide survey . 
  dude , it 's true . 
  it 's nothing personal . 
  yes , their new leader is for sure a socialist and their chancellor is a marxist . 
  what sort of policies are you curious about ? 
  oh come on , what the greeks did was nothing compared to what you guys did there . 
  your country marched thousands of children and elderly into the desert to die , sometimes they were naked to kill them faster . 
  you systematically torched greek villages , burning the people there alive . 
  i 'm not saying the greek soldiers did n't kill people in their occupations of eastern anatolia , but to use that as a reason for denying what you guys did is unacceptable . 
  just acknowledge your countries previous shortcomings . 
  i have no problem admitting that my country abused and murdered indians to keep power . 
  the germans acknowledge and apologise for the holocaust . 
  the french apologise for what happened in algeria . 
  now why do you say that what happened in the pontic area is `` propaganda . '', 
  fair enough . 
  i thought you were saying it was because it happened . 
  you are saying it is because they deny it , makes more sense . 
   accused the `` turkish government '' of a campaign of `` outrageous terrorizing , cruel torturing , driving of women into harems , debauchery of innocent girls , the sale of many of them at 80 cents each , the murdering of hundreds of thousands and the deportation to and starvation in the desert of other hundreds of thousands , [ and ] the destruction of hundreds of villages and many cities '' , all part of `` the willful execution '' of a `` scheme to annihilate the armenian , greek and syrian christians of turkey . '', 
  just shit happens , eh ? 
   whole purpose of this thread is to spread their dumbass propaganda you 're no worse than a holocaust denier . 
  fuck you . 
  no , they laundered nazi gold which was stolen from jews . 
  it 's not `` investment '', 
  explain germany then ? 
  this is why the uk is seen to have a decent hand in negotiations , trade-wise . 
  the uk does n't sell that much to eu countries in comparison to how much is sold to the uk . 
  same in cricket . 
  give berwick back reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  every major power has tried to keep a balance of power in a region . 
  less than 2 % of our jobs are 0 hour contracts , mate . 
  cool . 
  some others disagree , and hate soros for it . 
  he funds groups like the open society which advocate the removal of most national borders so that is guaranteed to cause some animosity . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  i agree that giving the eu money for projects is a bad idea , it would be better if the national or local government was able to distribute it themselves . 
   which is about # 16million a week assuming that 's a typo , you mean 162m right ? 
  so we do actually send 350m to the eu though ? 
  we get about half of it back but the statistic is still true , although potentially misleading . 
  you could argue that the money the eu spend in the uk is not money well spent though , as some of it does go to vanity projects . 
  that does n't really affect the us massively right now though . 
  is it actually a lie though ? 
  i thought we did send 350 million a week , but we get some of it back through eu grants etc. 
  yeah , the website just puts it as that . 
  feelsbadman, 
  it was just a guess , i seem to remember the uk having ~ 160b deficit , and 2.25 t gdp , i did it in my head and got 7 % . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  the uk 's deficit as a percentage of gdp was at 7 % , still super high now , but it is getting better . 
  not historically , that 's for sure . 
  even now , i do n't think it is liberal . 
  it has always been more conservative than the uk as a whole . 
  older , more white , generally more rural , hence why the snp were branded ` tarten tories ' for trying to take advantage of this . 
  nah , she has been the leader for 6 years . 
  it is n't her that is causing this . 
  you could say she is exploiting the situation well , though .
