if you did n't get it at this point , it would be worrying , it 's practically like beating you around the head with it at this point . 
  every other thread has it since it happened . 
  you do n't deal with that by blocking the website though , surely , and since carbon games is a us based company , could n't you just file a dmca ? 
  i suspect it 's the latter - given the amount of people i 've seen in public toilets in britain just walking straight out after without washing their hands , there 's no way it 's as high as 75 % - their sample must be incredibly biased or too small to really extrapolate . 
  of course , mine could be too , but it 's something i noticed a lot even as a young lad , because you know - it 's kinda disgusting . 
  to clarify , as i 've used noscript for a while , do i need facebook 's website blocked or fbcdn or actually both ? 
  i have both blocked , and only temporarily allow them when i actually visit facebook itself , but just wondering . 
  edit : apparently , i 'm not allowed to write the domain name for facebook in / r/europe, 
   i just wanted to say that comparing male circumcision to female genital mutilation is ingenious . 
  it seems based on your stance so far that you probably meant something else , like disingenuous . 
   it should 've been obvious from context what i meant . 
  which is entirely my point . 
  see this part of my original post :  of course , much fgm is much more close to male castration in some cases , and in such cases is of course far worse , so i do not mean to belittle or downplay fgm , only suggest that circumcision is still mutilation . 
  i would argue i provided context on the comparison and that i am clearly suggesting that there are various situations in which fgm is far worse than circumcision . 
   i agree with you on most things but you 're still being a contrarian dick . 
  it would appear that the popular opinion is the same one i hold in this matter , not sure how that makes it contrarian . 
  i also like how you say it 's not a personal attack , and then end with calling me a dick . 
  i was by no means exclusively referring to jews in my post though , and when referring to religious ideas , i was more talking about all of the abrahamic religions as a whole , rather than just judaism , as circumcision is practised by all three . 
  and what i was incorrectly paraphrasing was in reference to something in the old testament of the christian bible , which obviously has quite a lot of overlap with it 's jewish counterpart and source . 
  but i am not religious , not a christian or a jew , and only have vague ideas of any of the religions as i do n't really remember much of what i was taught in school about them . 
  so my attempt at understanding why people circumcise their children is of course flawed as i do n't have the same perspective . 
  i never said that . 
  go look at the usernames . 
  i replied to the person that said that . 
  [ see here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4slp8x/nine_out_of_ten_danes_would_ban_ritual/d5ads70 ) please do not attribute other people 's words to me . 
  anyway , i 'm not sure where you get this idea from :  so then every family decides that they want to do it because of medical reasons this simply is n't true . 
  for sure , there are a decent amount of situations where a circumcision was performed for medical reasons , but worldwide the majority are performed for religious reasons . 
  as i already stated though - my position on this has nothing to do with tradition or the history of what is considered normal . 
  also , while there may be some evidence to suggest that circumcision reduces risk of infection during intercourse - this is not something that a baby is going to be affected by . 
  in addition , medical procedures in such cases are usually not performed as a preventative measure - for example , appendix removal . 
  unless there is sufficient reason , it 's usually not worth the inherent risk involved with surgery to remove it . 
  since there is little to no harm of having an appendix for most people . 
  please note that i am not arguing for the banning of circumcision . 
  only that in babies and young children where there is not sufficient medical reason to warrant it . 
  a reduction in risk of stds , i highly doubt , would be considered a medical reason to warrant circumcising a newborn . 
  there are situations though where there is a real medical benefit to circumcision such as in some cases of [ phismosis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phimosis ) , but even then surgery is n't the only option , there are several other options . 
  if an adult chooses to have their own penis circumcised - for whatever reason - if they believe it will reduce their risk of stds , or for religious reasons , that is their choice , and i completely support their right to that choice . 
  i do not , however , believe that unnecessary surgery should be performed on a baby when there is no clear benefit aside from adjusting the child 's body to fit in line with the parent 's religious beliefs . 
  for reference , more babies die in america from circumcision than tonsillectomies are even performed . 
  as far as i 'm aware , that 's purely a medical procedure that is n't performed outside of that , and only done if there is evidence to suggest that it may help . 
  it is n't done purely on the grounds of a parent wanting it done to their child , not due to a religious belief that they must be removed . 
  that is quite a difference to circumcision the overwhelming majority of circumcisions worldwide are done for religious reasons , not medical ones . 
   this is n't some crazy feminists are against you conspiracy thing , it 's fact . 
  i do n't believe i ever mentioned any feminist conspiracy or anything to that sort . 
  i do n't believe there is anything wrong with drawing a comparison to something that ( i think ) most people here can agree with is an abhorrent action to force upon someone . 
  there is a large difference between drawing a comparison and suggesting they are equal - which is something i very clearly stated i was not doing . 
   using that comparison will just damage the reputation of the rest of your argument in the eyes of people who have a good knowledge of female circumcision . 
  i do n't have a great knowledge of this that is true , but it appears yours is lacking even more so . 
  there are several types of fgm that range from ( ** relatively speaking ** ) minor to a far more egregious removal of tissue . 
   female circumcision is much , much more damaging than male circumcision , it 's much , much more horrific and the effects are much worse . 
  the more minor end of the spectrum has some similarities with typical male circumcision - which is why i made the comparison . 
  no , they are not the same , and there are indeed much worse forms of fgm than compared to a ** typical ** male circumcision , but that does n't mean there are n't comparisons with the lesser forms of it . 
  of course , the other end of the spectrum , [ type 3 fgm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_genital_mutilation#/media/file:fgc_types.svg ) is much more closely akin to removing the entire male genitalia ( though i referred to it as a comparison of male castration in my other post , i think it would be more appropriate to compare it with a total penectomy ) . 
  [ as for prevalence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevalence_of_circumcision ) - circumcision is by and far not `` mainly '' an american phenomenon at all . 
  sure , it is very prevalent there , but it is also in almost all african countries too , as well as the middle east . 
  it 's by no means mainly american - many other countries have very high ( or even higher ) circumcision rates too . 
  it has been documented to have occurred for thousands of years dating back to at least ancient egypt , so it 's not like it started in america either . 
  even then , it 's `` revival '' in becoming far more widespread - particularly in english speaking nations was partially due to kellog 's efforts so there is some truth there , but it was by no means solely his - and nor solely due to the idea of it being a preventative measure against masturbation . 
  there were people advocating the supposed medical benefits too , such as a reduction in the chance of getting syphilis . 
  also , for reference , kellog not only advocated for male circumcision to prevent masturbation , but also to females too for the same reason , by way of pouring acid on their clitoris . 
   but in england circumcision is n't a thing at all . 
  this just is n't true at all . 
  comparatively speaking , the rate of circumcision in britain is indeed far lower than it is in the usa , but this is * crazy hyperbole * . 
  it has fallen greatly but it still exists , even outside of purely medical reasons . 
  both medical and other reasons for performing circumcision happen in england . 
  with about 8 % of the population being circumcised , and under 4 % of of the population being circumcised for medical reasons , leaving just over 4 % that are circumcised for other reasons ( presumably religious ones mostly ) . 
  there are similar rates across most of europe . 
  so circumcision here is very much * a thing * still . 
  to claim it does n't exist at all is just incorrect . 
  i see , an honest mistake on my part . 
  but i 'm not clear - the forming of the pact is done by the person that circumcises another and god or between the person circumcised and god ? 
  does this not still disregard the baby 's free will ? 
  if it is a pact between the baby and god , surely it should be done later when the baby has grown up and can actually decide for himself . 
  it does n't need to be an entire loss of function , just a degradation , or even no degradation in function - but in appearance instead . 
  though the appearance of a circumcised penis or uncircumcised is of course highly subjective and there 's no right answer there . 
  everything i have read suggests that circumcision reduces sexual sensitivity , which i would argue is a degradation in function . 
  the only point i meant was that outside of religious reasons , someone wanting to cut off part of their body is usually cause for concern . 
  but if you are of sound mind and choose to do so for religious reasons or for aesthetic reasons , then that is your choice . 
  i worded the part you quoted poorly though , which i can see how it would imply i was suggesting anyone wanting a circumcision has a mental health issue - which is not what i intended . 
  the issue i have is all about choice . 
  a baby can not choose . 
  that is my only problem with circumcision ( which is usually performed on babies ) . 
  i do not care what your body looks like . 
  if you 're happy with your penis , that 's great . 
  i 'm happy for you - i 'm not trying to suggest you are wrong or defective . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that a baby can not choose - and forcing something on a baby that can not be undone is denying their free will . 
  if you choose to be circumcised , then that is your choice - but it should never be a choice someone else makes for you . 
  this does n't make it any less mutilation though , by definition . 
  you can argue that self-mutilation is a choice you have a right to make for yourself , and i have no real care there , but i do not think it is right to ever force such a thing on someone else without them having a choice in the matter . 
  sorry , you are correct - i had misread that type 3 was the most common form of fgm , when it is type 1 & 2 . 
  the comparison i was trying to draw is still true though - they are both ( fgm and circumcision ) awful acts to force on someone . 
  i was n't meaning to go into a debate about the existence of god - only to look at it as much as i can , from the perspective of someone who believes in this . 
  whether or not god is real is irrelevant to this , the only thing that is relevant is that people believe he does , and choose to follow their version of the truth as they see it . 
  which is to say according to the abrahamic religions , god made us , gave us free will , and commanded that we should mutilate our newborns . 
  an act which denies the free will of the child . 
  those two things alone seem at odds with one another . 
  the biggest thing for me is , fgm is rightly called what it is , but when it 's males , it 's not male genital mutilation , it 's circumcision . 
  if you 're an adult of sound mind and want to change yourself , well that is your right . 
  of course , much fgm is much more close to male castration in some cases , and in such cases is of course far worse , so i do not mean to belittle or downplay fgm , only suggest that circumcision is still mutilation .
