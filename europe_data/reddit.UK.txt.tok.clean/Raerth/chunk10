  [ ] ( / problem ), 
   the flag of wallonia is not featured . 
  any flag can be added , if the request is backed by a reasonable argument .

  into the eu ? 
  however i 've no problem with surrounding states being able to sign up to some of the eu treaties if they so wish . 
  i think the eu should be a cultural grouping , but we should work to see a strong and stable group of countries surrounding us .

  the stars are representative of the eu , so non-eu people , like the swiss or norwegian , would feel no connection to them . 
  wonder how donutscurecancer will feel to see another redditor sporting the flag ... 
  something along this line , but without the eu stars . 
  want the logo to be representative of europe but not annoying the non-eu guys .

   btw , why do n't you just use the svgs from wikipedia instead of a sprite ?

  first flag-waving latvian so far . 
  well argued . 
   do you want it [ with ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ltybm.png ) or [ without ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zb9sg.png ) the crest ? 
  hmmm . 
  how would someone from schleswig-holstein refer to themselves ? 
  for example , the scottish people , the cornish people , the frisians , etc. 
  hmmm , not sure i 'd accept this . 
  so far , the flags i 'm accepting a representing culturally distinct entities within the host country ( with their own language ) , or secondary flags for an entire country . 
  do you have a good argument for this flag ?

  i think the biggest stumbling block here is the mass media . 
  in the chase for the biggest ratings , it 's easiest to simplify everything so the lowest common denominator can understand . 
  there is nothing simpler than `` us vs. them '' when it comes to politics . 
  any third party would not get the press . 
  agreed .

  not overly into flags ( despite currently having a convo with the mod of [ / r/vexillology ] ( / r/vexillology ) ) but understand your position . 
  a couple of people have submitted alternate flags , i 've no problem adding these if they have a good reason . 
  most probably . 
  an inbound link from a high-traffic subreddit is by far the best way of growing your subreddit . 
  i talk about this briefly in my [ guide for new mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/f2xrr/raerths_moderation_guide/ ) . 
  as an englishman , i agree . 
  what do you think this place is ? 
  what do you dislike about the flag ? 
  i like these calm little moments before the storm . 
  it reminds me of beethoven .

  you 're the 8th ,

  i also think it should . 
  eventually . 
  right now i do n't think it 's anywhere near ready for it .
