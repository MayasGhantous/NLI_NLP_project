  i understand that , what i was getting at was the myth that striving for freedom is a uniquely american trait . 
  you were saying it defines what `` being an american '' is . 
  i would say it defines what being a human is , and is played out worldwide . 
   american history is full of protests , marches , riots , assemblies and movements , and it of course is part of who we are . 
  a few hundred years ago most of europe was ruled by absolute hereditary monarchies with rights and justice only for the elite . 
  believe it or not , things are different now , and not for lacking `` protests , marches , riots , assemblies and movements '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure we did that ourselves . 
  quick quote from one of my favourite sci-fi authors :  hey , this is europe . 
  we took it from nobody ; we won it from the bare soil that the ice left . 
  the bones of our ancestors , and the stones of their works , are everywhere . 
  our liberties were won in wars and revolutions so terrible that we do not fear our governors : they fear us . 
  our children giggle and eat ice-cream in the palaces of past rulers . 
  we snap our fingers at kings . 
  we laugh at popes . 
  when we have built up tyrants , we have brought them down . 
  and we have nuclear - * fucking * - weapons .

  if you think [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/amxkc.png ) is clear enough , and you want it , let me know . 
  now that sounds like an interesting flag ... actually , i might add that to the sprite if you can find a suitable icon . 
  accurate title is accurate .

  for me , the perfect system would be local government having sovereignty over all laws that affect their residents day-to-day lives . 
  the higher up the chain of government you go , the less the laws affect the citizens , and the more they regulate interaction between communities . 
  criminals would be dealt with by the laws of the community that the crime was committed in . 
  tax on individuals would also be levied by their community . 
  the communities would in turn be taxed by the federal government . 
  if a community has a project that it can not afford through its taxes , it must apply to the federal government for a grant .

  one wonders what an icelandic redneck is like . 
   i am a europhile . 
  indeed i 'm a contradiction in terms : i am inherently anarchist but crave the institution of world government . 
  same here . 
  i 'd wish for local communities to have near complete control over how they live , but for a greater world government to legislate and police interaction between communities . 
  i had n't heard the phrase before , but i 'm aware of the concept . 
  i agree , all the uk parties see the eu as a good place to lay the blame for unpopular laws . 
  done . 
  i 'm very much for the * idea * of greater european integration , but not a big fan of the way it 's currently working . 
  supra-national groups of countries are , in my eyes , a positive and progressive step towards the future . 
  the problem comes when too many rules are dictated from on-high against the wishes of local communities . 
  in an ideal ( for me ) world , local governments would have much power over how their residents live , and the `` federal '' governments only legislate interaction between communities . 
  as for how the eu effects me . 
  apart from helping work towards a peaceful europe it does n't have much direct influence on my life . 
  apart from my last job which involved a lot of eu vat knowledge . 
  here it is the right ( conservates , ukip ) that are the most anti-eu . 
  the far-left are not big fans either , but they do n't have a major party that represents them . 
  the nominal `` left '' parties are pretty pro-eu .

  personally i think it 's a good idea . 
  you 're always free to [ request ] ( / r/ideasfortheadmins ) the admins do it . 
  gypsy is more a way of life than a cultural identity . 
  you can have people of pure roma descent who life in mainstream society but do n't identify as gypsies . 
  there are also other groups of people who are called gypsies .
