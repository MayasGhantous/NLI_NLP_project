  here is a comment i wrote a few months ago on this :  there are a number of itinerant groups in europe . 
  they 're not closely associated , if at all ; and there are a number of words that refer to them , many considered derogatory . 
  most of these groups have a long history in certain countries , and are treated slightly differently throughout europe . 
   mainland europe has the [ roma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) and the [ yaniche ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yeniche_ ( people \\ ) ) , also called gypsies . 
  the uk and ireland has the [ irish travellers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_travellers ) ( as seen in [ * snatch * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snatch_ ( film \\ ) ) , and are also called gypsies as they have a similar lifestyle and reputation ) . 
  also in the uk and parts of europe are the [ new age travellers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_age_travellers ) , who are similar to the [ rainbow family ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainbow_family ) and sometimes mistaken for irish travellers or roma , but have no strong link to them . 
  these are the biggest groups , although others exist . 
   these are groups of people who do n't integrate with society through choice , and earn the majority of their income through the black market . 
  this can be by offering cheap and untaxed labour , selling goods they produce , collecting scrap metal , running fairs or festivals ( especially the new age travellers and carnies ) , or by begging and theft . 
   the roma , yaniche and irish travellers are very insular groups . 
  they usually only marry within their communities . 
  marriages can sometimes be arranged and are usually during the early teens . 
   most of the groups are nomadic , and see this as their birthright . 
  they have a reputation for [ settling illegally on land until evicted ] ( http://www.dublinpeople.com/content/view/3809/57/ ) , and another reputation for [ leaving the area covered in litter and/or sewage ] ( http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/content/twm/news/story.aspx?brand=westonmercury&amp;category=newsnorthsomerset&amp;tbrand=westonmercury&amp;tcategory=znews&amp;itemid=weed28%20sep%202010%2014:25:23:363 ) . 
  many also have the literal belief in a [ god-given right to thieve from others ] ( http://ftp.fortunaty.net/com/sacred-texts/neu/roma/gft/gft021.htm ) . 
   in general there is a mutual belligerent attitude between `` gypsies '' and the population at their current location because of these reasons . 
  unless the admins did something in the backend , there 's no way of doing this . 
  over at [ / r/ideasfortheadmins ] ( / r/ideasfortheadmins ) people regularly request some sort of customization for user profiles , but the answer that comes back is that this will lead to `` personalities '' on the site and would lead to digg-style power users . 
  that said , some people who 've been on reddit a long time have their own subreddit ( same as their username ) and they put stuff there . 
  this is about as close as anyone can get to personalizing reddit . 
  edit : and if you did n't request here , then one of the other mods must have added your flag , not sure why tho !, 
  done . 
  almost , but not quite . 
  ca n't tell if troll ... 
  can only do the one flag at a time , sorry !, 
  did you not request your flag here ? 
  done . 
  done .

  luckily there is only one other `` raerth '' which seems to be a death knight on the wow forums ... 
  done . 
  cornish i 'll allow , but you 'd need to supply me the icon , 
  your username seems familiar ... you on b3ta ? 
  done . 
  there is always the eu flag or black flag too  i 've given you romania . 
  it 's not really a national pride thing , more so people can have an understanding of someone 's particular stance . 
  done . 
  which do you most identify with ? 
  done . 
  that 's what she ... nvm .

  if i lived in finland , i 'd be obsessed with summer too . 
  we 're not ? 
  i can see what he means . 
  i was in school before the fall of the berlin wall , and eastern europe * was * kinda just referred to as one entity . 
  sure , we heard the country names , but it was n't until much later ( when i studied outside school ) that i could tell you anything about them individually .

  done !, 
  that 's because * anarchy * can mean chaos . 
  although it derives from the greek for `` without ruler '' , it was adopted by latin to mean `` lawlessness '' . 
  this is where modern languages take their etymology from . 
  the philosophical doctrine of * anarchism * came much later . 
  sure , people can misunderstand the difference between the two , but there are better ways of educating them than calling them a naive pleb .

  that 's reddit-ninjas for you .
