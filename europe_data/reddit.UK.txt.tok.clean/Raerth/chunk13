  with the cables making it semi-official , do you think this may lead to future changes ? 
  maybe sweden becoming a full member of nato and joining discussions on a joint-eu military ? 
  might it have the opposite effect and lead to the public demanding a return to more neutral policy ? 
  i got the initial sprite from [ here ] ( http://www.flag-sprites.com/ ) and selected every country . 
  that flag is for '' [ united states minor outlying islands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_minor_outlying_islands ) '' , which is obviously the same , but i did n't go through the sprite to check for dupes when i created it .

  hmmm , i should probably make the sidebar link more prominent ... 
  maintaining it 's not so bad after the initial rush , plus at some point we 'll hit the character limit so good to get in quick . 
  still a [ little while to go ] ( / r/soccer/stylesheet . css ) .

  it 's a number of factors . 
  the food industry takes a lot of the blame . 
  so much of the processed food is full of crap . 
  it 's also much easier to have a more sedentary lifestyle in a country that 's built around the car . 
  this is also the country that invented the tv dinner . 
  food portions are also much larger , but not sure if that 's the chicken or the egg . 
  obesity is also much more acceptable in the states . 
  that said , there are plenty of americans who take their food seriously , home cooking is not as prevalent as it is in europe , but it 's not extinct . 
  many places in europe are also catching up with obesity levels . 
  i think we should see america as a warning to where modern life is leading all of us , rather than unique to their culture . 
   i heard stories that the portions in the us are huge ( compared to . eu portions ) you hear stories but it 's hard to actually understand . 
  every portion of food is about 50 % bigger than you 'd imagine . 
  it seems that everything has extra salt or sugar as well . 
  for a look at the extremes of this , search for [ * man v. food * ] ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=search_videos&amp;search_sort=relevance&amp;search_query=man+vs+food&amp;search=search ) on youtube .

  ahhh , the sweet taste of hierarchical power structure . 
  me too , but i think so many people would want pirate flags that we 'd be left with no other country flags , and would ruin the idea , 
  done !,

  i think the main difference is that over here we accept that taxes are going to happen , so demand we get good value back from our governments and protest when we think they 're slacking . 
  in the us many more people do n't accept the right of the federal government to collect taxes , or at least resent giving it . 
  the protest have to give away their money , and see social programs as their money being wasted on other people . 
  except old people and medicare , then they 're all for the socialism . 
  accurate ? 
  done !, 
  hey , i was tempted with texas , but then this is / r/europe and not / r/usa , 
  done !, 
  i thought i 'd seen your name before ... want a black flag ? 
  done !, 
  go on ... 
  you have a strange definition of `` better '' . 
  want a spanish flag ? 
  so what 's with the slovenian flag then ? 
  to be fair , i added rennfeild 's flag after his comment , 
  not an arrogant request at all . 
  the problem here is not texas , but the potential 49 other state flags . 
  sure , there may not be too much demand , but once an exception is made it 's hard to deny others . 
  as this is / r/europe i think i 'll have to stick to national flags only for non-european countries . 
  done . 
  yep , i 've no inclination to go crazy on the styling like [ / r/nosleep ] ( / r/nosleep ) or [ / r/zombies ] ( / r/zombies ) as this is a very news-orientated subreddit . 
  it did n't really seem to have any community vibe , although when a good comment thread did break out you could see some intelligent and informed comments coming though . 
  having things like a shiny flag next to your name sometimes encourages people to post more , brings a bit of welcome colour amongst the drabness and give readers an indicator of the commenter 's background . 
  still like to have a nice logo , and will probably add relevant links to the sidebar , but ca n't think of much else i 'd change right now . 
  still open to ideas . 
  i dare any country to queue better than us . 
  lol , yep . 
  even those who do n't * hate * us , at least pretend to . 
  especially the ones living down here . 
  as a peace offering i gave you a flag , 
  regular russia not ok ? 
  not the purpose of the flags tho , 
  would you tell someone you live in nato ? 
  us flag is fine , got all un-recognized nations in the sprite plus one american already , so not an issue . 
  i 'd rather not get into using things like the nato flag , as it 's more to represent the area a person identifies with . 
  cool with you ? 
  given you the uk one . 
  i think i 'd have to draw the line there simply for space , as the stylesheet does have a character limit and need to draw the line somewhere . 
  i 'd probably allow the cornish flag if it was wanted by someone , but do n't think any other uk flags would qualify . 
  sorry to disappoint your northern majesty , but if there 's gon na be rules i need to make them applicable to all , 
  seems that way ... quick lads , let 's get him !, 
  hmmm , flanders and frysl\u00e2n both have good standing as culturally distinct from their nation , including their own language . 
  if i get into allowing every province of every country i 'll run out of space pretty quickly ... 
  i reckon by the time i hit 65 the retirement age will be 80 :(,

  nah , think i 'll draw the line here before people start requesting united federation of planets flags .
