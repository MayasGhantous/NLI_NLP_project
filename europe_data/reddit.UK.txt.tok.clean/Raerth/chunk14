  you can keep your lunch on your desk thank you very much . 
  yeah , i was jumping for joy when i first found it , shame it does n't use the full famfamfam set !, 
  trying to stay away from eu stuff for any styling . 
  sure there are norwegian , swiss , balkan , russian redditors who 'd throw eggs at me if i did . 
  done . 
  let the teasing begin .

  eu flag is possible once i change to the new set later today . 
  i 'll mark you down for one . 
  yep , but they 're mostly crap . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.flag-sprites.com/ ) is almost perfect , but is missing a few countries , so is what i need to edit myself . 
  trust me , if i do n't include scotland or wales there will be angry neighbours .

  yep , going to change over to a different set in a bit . 
  just need to find/create a good sprite . 
  done . 
  i was looking at famfamfam too . 
  the annoying thing was not being able to find a css sprite with all the flags , and being too lazy to create it myself . 
  i agree they look nicer tho . 
  i 'm probably going to change over later today , 
  done . 
  grrr , should have made that note bigger :p, 
  done !, 
  done . 
  done . 
  done . 
  hmmm , think we 're gon na need smaller flags . 
  and i 've picked the wrong one for myself ... 
  let 's see if i 've got this right ... 
  probably the most common official term in the uk is [ black british ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_british ) , but from my experience most people of any ethnicity just say black . 
  edit : i should add that black is used to refer to the skin colour only . 
  when it comes to nationality most black people i know would either call themselves british , or by their country/culture of origin . 
  there 's a great , possibly apocryphal , story about a british sprinter in the olympic games being interviewed by an american reporter . 
   * reporter * : what does this win mean for you as an african american ? 
   * sprinter * : but i 'm british  * r * ( stumbling ) : i mean ... as a british african american ? 
   * s * : i 'm not african , i 'm not american , i 'm british . 
   reporter 's mental gears seize and she stares at the camera . 
  this is posted to the europe subreddit . 
  is this really an unknown fact to the average european ? 
   complete and utter cunting tosh . 
  ladies and gentlemen , the daily mail . 
  give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . 
  daily fail is at it again . 
  lib dems got a lot of 2nd places , which is why electoral reform is one of their policies . 
  no europe must n't . 
  europe is not at threat of invasion while we have two nuclear armed members ( and others nuclear capable with the turn of a screwdriver ) . 
  europe is at moderate threat of non-state aggression , but an army is irrelevant at combating terrorists . 
  instead law enforcement and intelligence agencies should be the line of defence against them . 
  europe is disparaged for not having sufficient global power projection . 
  i do n't think we * need * power projection . 
  the world had three centuries of european power projection and i 'd thought they were tired of it by now . 
  fucking intolerant bigots continue to ruin the world . 
  what bugs me is the implied criticism that because europe is not a single nation with a unified government , army and the power projection that comes with it , it should n't be taken seriously . 
  i think the us needs to get over viewing the world through a militaristic lens . 
  i 'm pro-europe and european integration , but a militarily strong europe is not ( in my eyes ) a positive step to world peace . 
  unfortunately i think this is an echo of a greater american view of europe . 
  obama declined the invitation to the spanish summit , according to reports , due to frustration over meeting three different presidents to discuss eu policies . 
  in the last couple of months this subreddit has had a huge jump in subscribers , and good discussion threads are appearing more frequently . 
  we 're only halfway through february [ and look at the traffic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vhd2c.png ) !, 
  *** ** rule change ** : flags will now only be given to accounts over 6 months old . 
  i dislike giving people space in the stylesheet only for their account to disappear a few days later . 
  there is a character limit for css so want to make it last as long as possible . 
  please do not request a flag if you do n't see yourself joining discussions here . 
  some people have requested mouseover text for comment flags so they can identify where people are from . 
  i can not see a way of doing this with minimal extra css , but have [ updated the flag request page ] ( / elxyi ) to show which flags are in use . 
  i also want to create a rule for new flags . 
  ** where do you think we should draw the line for people wanting custom flags ? 
  ** *** if you have not noticed , in the sidebar i 've a [ list of european subreddits ] ( / ejgwj ) .
