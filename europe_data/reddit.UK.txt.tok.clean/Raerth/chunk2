  being geographically diverse is not an indication of being a good mod . 
  being active is . 
  again , what do you think we do ? 
  there 's few people out there who actually are willing to spend time checking webpages for spam on a daily basis for months and years on end with no reward and endless abuse . 
  yes , people with a reputation for being sad enough to actually spend their free time doing this get invited to do the same in other subreddits . 
  that 's because many other people are active for a month or two then are never heard of again . 
  sun rises , bird sings , mod get downvoted . 
  that 's the way of the world . 
  i 've just asked / u/pappenheimer if he wants to mod here to counter our evil anti-german bias . 
  what do you think this clique is doing ? 
  active as i know they subscribe to the subreddit and they tell me about instances of racism and spamming they view here . 
  is your problem that the mods are not more varied in nationality , or that none of them are german ? 
   i have no way to check that , but let 's accept it . 
  [ you can filter a search by subreddit and author ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=author%3araerth&amp;restrict_sr=on ) [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ied93/reurope_additional_moderators_needed/ ) is the post where i added the mods . 
  / u/span12 must have deleted his comment . 
  / u/aqwis was deleted as a mod due to inactivity . 
   and it just happened to be another british and an american ? 
  yes . 
  on an english-language website most of the active and known mods are native english speakers . 
  i know these two by reputation as i co-mod with them , and i know they use this subreddit a lot . 
  that 's the two major reasons they were added . 
  their nationality makes no difference . 
   self-nominated i have no problem with self-nomination . 
  their nominations were upvoted and no-one pointed out any major problems in the comments . 
  that was good enough for me . 
  what influence do you think the mods nationality will have on the way they remove spam ? 
  i 'm not sure what benefits you think modding brings , but we 're not all sitting in reddit-supplied jaccuzzis snorting coke off high-class escorts . 
  we just look at reports and spam queues in spare moments of the day . 
  agreed . 
  nationality was not a factor in who was added . 
  i added / u/theskynet and / u/span12 about 2 years ago , because they were the only people who responded to a mod-post asking for new mods . 
  i added / u/skuld and / u/davidreiss666 because i wanted mods i know are active in this subreddit and have a good reputation at modding . 
  i added / u/jb _ uk , / u/gschizas , / u/bezbojnicul and / u/metaleks because they were nominated by the community , were the most popular nominations with / u/theskynet and / u/span12 , and i could see nothing in their posting history to suggest they 'd be a mistake . 
  everyone should grab their username subreddit !, 
   edit : [ except skuld . 
  ] ( / r/skuld ), 
  it 's not a case that he was `` one of us '' , but the case that he had broken no laws . 
  the mods who supported the ban did n't like the idea of people losing their jobs because someone found their redditing to be * distasteful * . 
  as i said in the article , there 's a subreddit for gay teens that many people may find distasteful . 
  we do n't want a precedent set of people going around outing the real-life identities of people just because they do n't like what they 're doing online . 
  violentacrez may not be the best poster-boy for this cause , but that 's where many chose to draw the line . 
  one man 's trash ... , 
  i found it an unneccesary escalation . 
  it seemed to me that a few mods were more interested in willy-waving than moderating . 
  gawker * loves * confrontation like this . 
  they thrive on it . 
  i thought it would be better to ignore them and just stick to moderating . 
  [ it annoyed me too ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/16/reddit-gawker-ban ) . 
  you want to be a mod ? 
  i can tell you how to do it , or at least how i did it . 
  it 's not difficult , just takes a lot of time doing boring and repetitive tasks with no thanks and occasional abuse . 
  you can [ create your own subreddit ] ( / reddits/create ) and you will be the top mod . 
  building subreddits from scratch is hard though . 
  [ here 's my guide on how to do it . 
  ] ( http://redd.it/f2xrr ) you can find an abandoned subreddit and [ request to take it over . 
  ] ( / r/redditrequest ) you can hang about in / r/needamod and / r/adoptasubreddit , and join a pre-existing subreddit . 
  / r/modclub also has recruitment threads from time to time . 
  you can find a small subreddit based around a topic you enjoy , if you message the mod and tell them you love the topic and want to help make the subreddit successful , you have a good chance of being accepted . 
  once you 've become a moderator , and if you get a reputation as a good mod ( lots of activity , no substantial drama ) then your name can get thought of when co-mods are looking for active , helpful mods in their subreddits . 
  i 'm actually one of / u/britishenglishpolice 's sockpuppets . 
  do n't tell anyone . 
  i do n't have that information . 
  i 'm british . 
  thanks for the link . 
  i 've removed that comment . 
  ( if anyone is * really * curious , [ here 's a screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vgcskmz.png ) . 
  contains slurs . ), 
  we 've never been anti-discussion here . 
  for the most part the only things we actively remove are offensive slurs when used to attack people . 
  trying to find a line between allowing open discussion , and making the subreddit a place where everyone can feel welcome and not victimized , could be * interesting * . 
  this is why we 've added more hands and brains to work on the issue . 
  i agree with you . 
  there 's a fine line to be trod here . 
  when all the new mods accept the invitations i 'm going to have a discussion with everyone to see where our consensus is on this issue , we will then make another mod post to talk about racism in comments . 
  removing spam is censorship . 
  removing memes and image macros is censorship . 
  removing stuff that 's not about europe is censorship . 
  here 's my reasoning : i mod with him in a few subreddits , including the defaults / r/politics and / r/technology . 
  this has given me a view of his mod actions behind the scenes . 
  despite the rumours , he is not actually on any sort of obvious crusade or vendetta , and definitely not one that can be construed from his mod actions . 
  because of all the hullabaloo that surrounds him he has probably been examined more than most other mods . 
  he is a prolific submitter of content to this subreddit . 
  this means he 's active here and would be a good pair of eyes in the place . 
  my only issue with him is that he can sometimes be a bit abrupt with people in comments and modmail . 
  same goes for / u/theskynet . 
  the people on the receiving end of this are usually spammers and trolls , but it can sometimes inflame a situation beyond reason . 
  this is a fairly minor issue , and something that can be improved . 
  do you have any specific concerns about him ? 
  * they 're * , * too * , 
  what made you think this is a democracy ? 
  the top mod / u/jeresig could decide to come back to the subreddit , remove all the mods , delete all the posts , and make the subreddit private so no-one can view it . 
  this is fully within reddit 's rules and there 's nothing anyone could do about it . 
  that 's the way reddit works . 
  subreddits are basically * owned * and operated by the mods who can do anything ( within legality ) they want without the admins caring . 
  the only thing redditors can do is find another subreddit . 
  luckily , most mods enjoy the topics and want to have an interesting and active subreddit . 
  they do their best to make sure many people find their subreddit worthwhile to subscribe to . 
  it 's not easy to build up subscriber numbers . 
  i 've built a couple from scratch and can tell you , it 's hard . 
  for mods to ignore the community is fatal to a subreddit , however mods = gods , and have to make rules , enforce rules , and there will always be people who hate the rules and try and cause trouble .
