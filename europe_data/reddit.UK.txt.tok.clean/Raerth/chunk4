  nah , i was unemployed . 
  best subreddit to mod was / r/trees . 
  the modmail was mostly people trying to make a submission and sending it to us by mistake . 
  at one point in time i was simultaneously modding / r/politics , / r/worldnews , / r/technology , / r/europe , / r/unitedkingdom , / r/ukpolitics , / r/music and / r/metal . 
  you do n't know nerdrage until you have / int / , / pol / and / mu / after you at once . 
  i 'm not currently going to get involved in pointing fingers or guessing reasons for past removals . 
  but i am going to insist that going forward any removals like this have a comment from a mod explaining why a post was removed and what rule it was breaking . 
  if not by the end of today , at the very latest before the weekend . 
  i want to have a lot ironed out by the end of today tho . 
  grumble grumble . 
  our moderation here should be more transparent and if not * agreed * with , it should at least be * understood * . 
  we 're talking today about how this should be implemented . 
  i 'll make a post later . 
  *** ** edit ** i would also like to make clear this should not turn into a witchhunt against / u/dclauzel . 
  most of his removals and bans i agree with . 
  the major thing i want to change is the transparency . 
  i do n't agree that posts should be removed or users banned without a clear and understandable reason . 
  i also want to reduce/eliminate permabans . 
  maybe with a 30 day maximum , this is one of the things we are discussing . 
  every mod is fallible , we are just people trying to keep this place ticking over in our spare time . 
  sometimes when we check the subreddit and a thread has become a shitshow , it can be very tempting to take the nuclear option and remove/ban/salt the earth just to try and get the subreddit back to normal in the 5 minutes we have before our boss/wife/customer / hooker notices we 're absent . 
  do n't take every mod mistake or overreaction to be an indication that we 're signed up members of the lizard illuminatii . 
  if we were rich enough for that we 'd be on the beach with a margarita and not wielding a mop in here . 
  you commented when the post was 13 minutes old . 
  how many comments did you expect in that time ? 
  the same story was at the time # 3 in / r/europe with hundreds of comments . 
  thank you for your submission !, 
  unfortunately , it has been removed . 
  this was removed as it was very recently reposted and it had received a good amount of attention . 
  feel free to resubmit the content in accordance with the rules . 
  if you have any questions , please [ message the moderators ] ( / message/compose ? to = % 2fr % 2feurope ) . 
  we apologize for the inconvenience . 
  i used to mod / r/vexillology , ( in fact i was the guy who initially added the flair system there , although the current one is more advanced ) , i 'll speak to their mods about the possibility of adding their bot . 
  it 's not going to be something simple , but you 're right about not reinventing the wheel . 
  #user was banned for this post, 
  i suspect if this survey was carried out by a non-british organization , britain would n't rank so highly . 
  we do n't just rely on reports , but we do n't check every comment thread multiple times a day . 
  how often do you report racist comments ? 
  ireland is to the side of great britain , likes guinness and dislikes the english . 
  italy is beneath switzerland , likes pasta and dislikes romanians . 
  how does making the window wider solve the problem ? 
  added . 
  i 'd prefer to keep the text visible but this will do for now . 
  i can not `` remove '' default reddit css . 
   it looks awful are you talking about seeing it on the sprite , or when you see it next to someone 's name ? 
  when it appears as flair you do n't see any `` white borders '' , it 's just a square . 
  it 's not white at the sides . 
  it 's transparent at the sides as it 's a square . 
  i ca n't remove or edit reddit 's default css , only add to the mod stylesheet . 
  find a good 16x11px image and i 'll add it to the queue . 
  no , we can not edit html , only add additional css . 
  anarchist/stateless flag is allowed at mod discretion . 
   could be fixed if there were two flair sets not sure you really thought this through , 
  yep , i ca n't think of a good way to fix this . 
  trying to use ` : float ` causes all sorts of problems . 
   ( i have the page zoomed in a bit by default ) not something i can fix . 
  complain to the browser devs !, 
  we decided before to only have flags which represent nations / regions . 
  do people want to keep this rule ? 
  we already have more flags than that set . 
  the `` 2500 flags '' does n't mean 2500 * different * flags , 
  we did chop the head off the last king who did n't do what parliament told him ... 
  yes , you can download the . csv with all the data . 
  i put the link in the post ... 
  you can download the csv , link in the post . 
  i was wielding sarcasm in a typical british passive-aggressive reply , 
  if only you could access the data in . csv form and subdivide it by nation . 
  the term `` pervert '' implies someone whose behaviour is at odds with a moral code . 
  a moral code is a set of social mores , and inherently biased to a majority . 
  the option `` other , identify as male '' means solely that someone identifies in public as male , but their sex is either female or an intersex condition . 
  that intersex individuals exist is not liberal bias , but demonstrable fact . 
  including an option for these people is not liberal bias , but an attempt at inclusiveness . 
  the label these people `` perverts '' for not conforming to a third-party 's moral code * is * bias . 
  i would also suggest it 's bigotry , as is the rest of your comment . 
  you really ca n't leave it alone can you ...  no ones self identity is `` subsaharan african '' . 
  they are ... 
  i 'm glad you read this bit :  you can tick as many options as necessary to describe your ethnic background . 
  ** this focuses on common major european ethnicities by design , if you 're missing an option feel free to add it yourself . 
  ** and then ;  if we 're really out to poll attitudes towards sinti , roma and jenischen people , more dimensions/questions might have been a good idea . 
  so i go from being too detailed to not detailed enough . 
  when creating this i had to balance what was sufficient detail , and what was too much detail . 
  i had to cut out around half the questions i originally asked as the test group said it was too long . 
  sorry that this particular section was not detailed enough for you . 
  it 's a tough balance to achieve , and i 'm not a professional pollster , but a volunteer mod knocking something up in his lunchbreak . 
   it 's bugging me increasingly , especially from the british . 
  i apologise . 
  the addition of an ethnicity category was a request after the last survey . 
  i agree that ethnicity is a flawed concept , but we 're not looking for scientific truth here , just what individuals self-identify as . 
  the `` romani '' question is in the * prejudice * section . 
  people complain that \\ / r/europe is a festering pile of prejudice , so that section aims to test the waters . 
  would you prefer that we did n't ask about anti-romani prejudice in the subreddit ? 
  as for the final section , just write me off as another parochial inselaffe and do n't take it personally . 
  yes , i speak french and thai . 
  you are still trying to be combative . 
  i still do n't think you understand that it 's not the best way to get your point across . 
  try and be a bit more easygoing and you 'll find people take you more seriously . 
  if you rage constantly you 'll find people either ignore you or write you off as a child . 
  maybe you should work on your social interaction skills if you want people to engage and take you seriously . 
   factual argument i did not see one of these . 
  yep , it 's best to remind people that the internet is not `` serious business '' .
