  the rage complaints such as yours are in a tiny minority of comments . 
  i acknowledge them , but i do not let a tiny minority dictate what i do . 
  you are an angry person . 
  i recommend trying to be a happy person instead . 
  it makes life much more enjoyable . 
  goodbye . 
  there is an announcement up there ^ , 
  the last one was about 9 %, 
  other : _______, 
  yes , but the question is about which religion you practice , not what goes on inside your head when you do it . 
  the following question asks about strength of belief . 
  sounds like this * really * bothers you . 
  i recommend going for a walk outside . 
  because the vast majority of british people are of mostly germanic stock . 
  so pick other ? 
  true , i think you can tell my blood alcohol level by the amount i argue . 
  what religious rites , traditions or teachings do agnostics follow ? 
  nope , [ not me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nkjrb.png ) i think agnosticism fits under `` no religion '' because i 'm asking what religious creed people live by . 
  agnostics do not generally live their life by any specific religious teachings . 
  i do n't think you understand the question . 
  so enter it in the `` other : ________ '' section . 
  what do you think that 's there for ? 
  yep , sorry about that . 
  the final `` fun '' questions must be answered . 
  this survey is not seeking scientific truth , it 's seeking the opinion of people in this subreddit . 
  this is right . 
  i 'm working on it . 
  yep , i was only saying that i have no way of identifying people . 
  there is the chance that google could match an answer in this survey to an ip address / logged-in google account . 
  if people think this is a valid risk then they should not answer any questions . 
  the '' / '' means `` or '' , so that option is `` no religion * or * atheist '' . 
  agnostic fits under `` no religion '' . 
  you mean `` prefer not to answer '' ? 
  or `` indifferent '' ? 
  the only questions what do n't have this option are the `` fun '' ones at the end . 
  do n't be put off the `` no religion '' selection just because it also includes atheism . 
  it 's meant to be picked if you do not follow a recognised religion . 
  agnosticism is not a recognised religion , therefore you should select `` no religion '' . 
  if you * do * follow the rites of a specific religion due to tradition or social norms , but internally you identify as agnostic , then you should select the religion you follow but note your strength of belief as `` negligible '' . 
  religion \u2260 faith . 
  agnosticism can not be described as a religion in any way . 
  to be honest i 'm happy that 's the only mistake found so far . 
  fixed . 
  is agnosticism a religion ? 
  if it is , pick `` other '' . 
  if is is n't , pick `` no religion '' . 
  an internet survey designed to sample public opinion should never be expected to satisfy every nuanced political position out there , 
   a lot of questions were grade 1-5 and mandatory to answer but is selecting 3 really equal to no opinion/prefer not to answer ? 
  if [ 1 ] is disagree and [ 5 ] is agree , what do you think [ 3 ] would be ? 
  are you ? 
  ah well , it 's only the `` fun '' questions that do n't have that option anyway . 
  the middle would be `` indifferent '' . 
  it 's not aspiring to have a 100 % scientific result . 
  it 's finding out what people self-identify as . 
  i added it because an ethnicity question was requested after the last survey . 
  it does say you can pick as many or as few as required . 
  you do not have to only pick one option . 
  you can also choose `` other white '' or `` other : _______ '' and have anything you want . 
  which covers agnosticism . 
  it 's not a religion . 
  you can leave it blank if you wish . 
  `` other : _______ '', 
  that wo n't work , as the bot died a while back . 
  i need to change to the new inbuilt flair system . 
  what did you have in mind ? 
  yep , that 's `` blank '' , the default response . 
  yep , luckily the question is focused on recreational drugs . 
  of course it 's a drug . 
  it 's a legal drug , but still a drug . 
  the middle answer would be `` indifferent '', 
  those labels do n't have as much / the same meaning in european politics as they do in american politics . 
  surely you can pick romani ? 
  [ ] ( / problem ), 
  the question also explains it is asking '' * the country on your passport * '' . 
  the question is not asking what country , it 's asking what nationality . 
  the question is asking your nationality . 
  scotland is not independent yet . 
  i had to use broad strokes or there would be 300 possibilities . 
  basque and celtic are also missing . 
  this is why people can add their own option . 
  `` other : _______ '' although germanic or slavic would account for a lot of people in baltic states , no ? 
  no survey can be perfect , and no accurate nuanced opinion can be polled by a 5-point scale . 
  i understand where you 're coming from , and predict a few other people will take issue with one question or other . 
  but tried to give as many options as possible . 
  you mean , a redditor ? 
   edit : that will be the least surprising part of the survey , i agree . 
  the political answers should be more interesting and relevant to the subreddit . 
  yep , just polishing the new member survey which will be posted tomorrow morning . 
  interesting ideas . 
  get in the [ chatroom ] ( http://webchat.snoonet.com/?nick=&amp;channels=europe ) and ping me , i 'd like to talk to you about these , and show you what i 've got so far . 
  i set up flair using a bot before it was built into reddit . 
  the bot 's operator has closed it , and i have n't got round to changing all the css to use the in-built flair system . 
  simply because there 's a fuckton of flags to adjust . 
  i promise it 'll be done this week . 
  please be advised that reddit is having caching problems and lots of comments and posts are not appearing . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/11yd6q/my_post_has_partially_vanished_not_deleted_by_mods/ thank you . 
  ** edit ** : in case you do n't believe me , [ here 's a screenshot from the mod log which shows recent deleted comments . 
  already am . 
  i 'll pm you a preview . 
  whenever it goes live it 'll be pinned to the top for a week ,
