  however , i did say that we could review these rules again in the future . 
  it may be time for that now ... 
   clicking on ` new ' shows that noone in months has got a flag . 
  reading the post also tells people to message the mods , not comment in there ... 
  done . 
  i 've got thumbnails turned off in my [ preferences ] ( / prefs ) anyway , but have done this for those that have n't . 
   ok , that was strange -- i attached a link to the bbc to the post , but it went in as a self post . 
  link submissions do not have a text field , if you click over to ` self ' to add text it will not post the link . 
  i thought the problem with ca 's economy was the fact that any budget change or tax rise had to be approved by a ridiculously high percentage of the legislature , and it was locked in stalemate . 
  that aside , i agree that arrrnahld becoming any sort of high-ranking eu politician is a fantasy .

  have you seen my list of european subreddits in the sidebar ? 
  a good few communities there . 
  this is the problem when people talk about `` gypsies '' . 
  there are many itinerant groups in europe . 
  off the top of my head i can think of the roma , yannish , irish travellers , new-age travellers and even some carnie groups . 
  i know there will be more i 've missed . 
  in eastern europe the roma are dominant , but a much smaller size in the uk . 
  i have no personal experience of them so can not comment . 
  you seem to have a problem with the term mainstream society . 
  the itinerant group i have most personal experience with are irish travellers ( as i live in the uk where they are the largest group of `` gypsies '' , and have known some personally ) . 
  these are people who consider themselves culturally and ethnically distinct from the host country ( whether this is true or not is another question ) . 
  they also do not recognise the right of their host society to impose laws upon them , they work mostly in the black market and largely do not pay taxes . 
  sure this is a generalisation , but it 's also pretty accurate . 
  i think this is a slightly different issue to the gypsy question . 
  i 'm not that surprised that an opinion poll during a global recession shows many people think large-scale immigration makes the job market tougher . 
  itinerant communities on the other hand are not usually competing for employment with current citizens . 
  those two situations are unrelated . 
  the different itinerant groups in europe collectively called gypsies largely choose not to be a part of mainstream society . 
  some individuals may make the decision to give up their way of life and enter , but as a whole they remain resistant to the idea . 
  immigrants on the other hand , commonly want to become a part of their host nation , gain employment and pay taxes .

  i 'm happy with this . 
  can you supply a 16x11px flag ?

  sorry , only space for one flag . 
  done . 
  now go to fucking sleep . 
  to clarify my position , i believe that laws which most effect the daily lives of individuals should be set as locally as possible . 
  the higher you go up the hierarchy of power the less laws affect citizens and the more they affect regional/national problems . 
  having a pan-national parliament dictating laws on individuals is the wrong way of doing it . 
  let the town or city decide how their inhabitants live , and give people the right to move away from towns they dislike to towns they like . 
  even if this means having nazi towns , muslim towns and lgbt towns . 
  as long as interaction between the towns * is * governed by the eu . 
  personally , i think in a situation like this the extremists would paint themselves into an unproductive corner . 
  i think that the few situations i 'd be happy with the uk going to war , it would probably be in french interests as well . 
  ie : direct attack against the uk, 
  i 'm very pro-europe in the long term ( short-term i think it 's a bureaucratic nightmare ) . 
  a pan-european armed forces is only sensible in my eyes . 
   the only problem is when one country wants to go and not the other ( like iraq ) . 
  i do n't see this as a problem . 
  i see this as a benefit . 
  if the uk was only capable of taking half an armed forces to iraq they might not have done it . 
  yep , do n't worry . 
  that 's why i differentiated anti-crazy from anti-feminism . 
   take anything posted from me past 2100 gmt as posted under the influence of alcohol . 
  i 'm far more likely at this time to get dragged into random internet arguments just for the hell of it . 
  i 've had a long convo recently with an acquaintance who insisted all hetero sex is , by definition , * rape * , so had my anti-crazy loaded against feminism . 
  i 'm far from anti-feminist or pro-rape culture . 
  my point was merely intended to defend that joke as simply a joke . 
  it could be argued that seeing it merely as humour means i am pro-rape culture , but hell to it . 
  common social attitudes ? 
  i hope you 're not suggesting that themightydane is indeed suggesting it 's acceptable to rape ... maybe the common social attitude is suggesting rape is funny ? 
  again , i 'd disagree themightydane was approaching from that angle . 
  maybe it 's because he 's male and mentioned rape in an attempt at humour ? 
  this is the part you want to criticise , correct ? 
  by using his ethnicity 's history in the context of a comment which suggested taking to ships and invading another country , he was participating in the male cultural oppression of women ? 
  how very dare he . 
  guess we ca n't ironically refer to history unless it 's something that was inoppressive . 
  this subreddit has only recently started to get some decent traffic . 
  subscriber numbers have risen by 25 % in the last two months , which is significant for a 3yr old sub . 
  that was what i was basing it on before . 
  but most people wanted it kept back to official nations only . 
  because i wanted to draw the line somewhere , i went with that .

  blame [ boq ] ( / user/boq ) , 
  this is the traffic stats for the subreddit .
