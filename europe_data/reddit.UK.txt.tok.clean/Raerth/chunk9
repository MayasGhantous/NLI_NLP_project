  as there is limited space , i 'm only giving flags to people who are regular submitters . 
  as you 're one of the canadian influx , let me know if you reckon you will be staying around and not just a one-off ,

  no problem handing them out , but would prefer to give them to people who will actually be regular commenters as there 's limited space . 
  reckon you fit the bill ? 
  can you see yourself actually being a regular poster to / r/europe ?

  it 's no problem at the moment to request in the thread using a new comment . 
  because i use [ reddit addict ] ( / redditaddict ) i get these notifications quicker than i would get mod mail . 
  in a few months , when the thread closes to new comments , i 'll add a mod mail link . 
  here 's what i 've been basing flag allocation on : outside ~ ~ the eu ~ ~ europe  un-recognised states only . 
  within ~ ~ the eu ~ ~ europe  national flags , or widely recognised sub-national flags . 
  my definition of `` widely recognised '' has been swayed , and i need to make some firm decisions on what i will allow . 
  i was kinda thinking an area 's flag will be allowed if it meets a couple of the following conditions : * there is an independence movement * it completes in an international sport separately to the host nation * it has a different language to the host state * it is closely linked to an ethnic group ... but then all sorts of grey areas pop up . 
  edit : i 'll just say that if i decide on any rule changes , anyone who has a flag that is no longer allowed will have theirs grandfathered in . 
  if we remove the north american flags , all that will happen is people will say `` my grandfather once lived in norway , i 'll have their flag ! '', 
  not had much luck in redditlogos before , which is why i thought i 'd throw it out to people here before i try again . 
  england * is * an actual country ,

   commonality on roads ( i 'm looking at you uk ! ) . 
  i do n't see why this is such a big deal ( although i do n't actually drive ) . 
  if the uk were sharing a border with a country with a country that drove on the right , then it would be a major headache . 
  but seeing as you need a ferry or train to get your car to somewhere with different rules , then why does it matter ?

  there 's no other way to attach the flag without making it a background image of the link . 
   also , the name of [ the file ] ( http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qh4j_0.png ) would n't help much !, 
  this was mentioned previously . 
  problem is i 'm not sure how i can add this with only a minimal amount of css . 
  adding a hover effect to users would mean doubling all the selectors , and use up the space pretty quickly . 
  unless i 'm missing something clever that is . 
  sometimes i wonder if people ever read the sidebar .
