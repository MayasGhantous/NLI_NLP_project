  how about i just go that restaurant/bar as normal and not pay their bloody wage ? 
  & nbsp ; i dont mind tipping people who does me an absolute solid but this whole expectaion to `` always tip your waitress ! '', 
  fuck that usa shit . 
  it 's too late mom , freeeeedom ` murica, 
  this is literally what happened . 
  this sub can disagree-vote as much as it wants but this happened and downvoting wo n't change it . 
  the lack of allied assistance was n't because we did n't care but because we could n't get there . 
  we ca n't blame sweden because they were just looking after their people and we ca n't blame the allies either - we can however blame the nazi 's and communist regime . 
  france and the uk were already stretched thin and were n't capable of deploying and acting upon a mass campaign to north-east europe , it would require help . 
  the thing is you 've came at me with this argument assuming i think turkey is european simply because of geography , which is n't the case at all . 
  politically turkey is very much european being involved in numerous western organisations , has supported western involvments in the middle east and shares some ideologies ( though take that last it with a pinch of salt . 
  they do seem to be leaning more middle eastern with their ideologies these days ) . 
  & nbsp ; throughout the history of turkey it has always been involved with something in europe . 
  whether that be it 's empire , wars or aid etc. 
  & nbsp ; if you yourself strictly only ever see things in geographical ways then fine , from your perspective turkey is simply eurasian just like russia and neither of them are european but actually asia due to where their landmass percentage is . 
  i do n't want to flair point but you 're greek and are very clearly biased . 
  turkey is as european as russia whether you like it or not . 
  employing extravagant examples like britain being south american simply because of the falklands is no argument against turkey being european . 
  & nbsp ; do you consider britain and ireland to be european even though we share no land border ? 
  & nbsp ; edit : i could be an absolute cunt and say geographically cyprus clearly belongs to turkey, 
  let 's not be ridiculous now . 
  tova\u042fish , all of us he\u042fe will one day be \u042fussia . 
  now come , b\u042feak b\u042fead with me f\u042fiend and let us d\u042fink to \u042fussia . 
  yeah , it 's a similar situation with russia but more complicated ( major russian cities are all in the west so it 's easier to assume its european ) . 
  & nbsp ; typically you 'd just go off where the capital is placed : is it europe or asia ? 
  back when it was instabul it could easily be considered european but god damn it they just had to change it . 
  : / & nbsp ; anyway to quickly wrap it all up , turkey is a eurasian country with deeper political ties to europe than asia . 
  one could argue that the differences in culture split us apart but let 's be honest , europe is pretty damn culture diverse and always has been - there is no absolute normal `` this is what we are '' culture . 
  same reason brits consider themselves british over european, 
  turkey is in europe, 
  do n't worry , i 'm sure merkel will tell russia they 're being very naughty boys . 
  grab a bed sheet , spray the letter ` a ' on it , put a circle round it too and go fight the good fight my man . 
  & nbsp ; be sure to murder any scots that you see in yorkshire wielding a crossbow whilst you 're at it, 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  honestly i 'm glad that this is being offered to northern ireland and i hope it strengthens our unity . 
  even though we 're all the same nation it often feels as though britain and northern ireland are completely different . 
  westminster needs to focus more on working with northern ireland . 
  i just hope theresa may does n't fuck shit up and send northern ireland back into the 70 's -90 's, 
  the taxes of our parents, 
  it 's no joke friendo, 
  i was about to get the tea but then this letter from ... 
  popped out of my toaster, 
  ** adorable ** , this french felow is under the ** illusion ** that we ** noble ** brits speak french . 
  so ** clich\u00e9 ** . 
  anyway i hope you 're paying ** attention ** when i say we do not speak french . 
  just , for your ** information ** . 
  sweden just got my vote next eurovision, 
  smoke and wine breaks were expected, 
  to be honest the moat is only good for keeping the spanish out, 
  or under it !, 
  & nbsp ; * high fives france *, 
  y' all better hide yo islands coz britain is here and we feel like occupying . 
  gmime sum crete , dont tell nobody but i saw a russian there , maybe . 
  christina aguillyria, 
  well at the time the turks were doing it to prevent a fascist regime from taking over . 
  the uk did n't stop them because britain favoured the turks ( they both got along well ) . 
  & nbsp ; edit : autocorrect, 
  stereotypes aside , germans seem to get sarcasm . 
  the real problems begin when you start going to us subs . 
  makes sense when you think about how diverse the country is, 
  tell a school teacher that your 4 year old son has been circumcised and no one bats an eye . 
  go into a high school at 16 with a lip piercing and two stretched ear lobes , suddenly everyone in the school loses their mind, 
  you can have them then, 
  well it 's hardly surprising , like seriously , what do you expect the ex colonial empires to vote ? 
  abstaining was the right thing to do there is no back stab to be found here, 
  you realise the uk ca n't get bitch slapped at the un right ? 
  just like china , russia , us and france, 
  gravity is a fake human construct , god did this, 
   germans do n't read english news you , sir . 
  are fake news . 
  bad , very bad . 
  but it says '' ** best ** bier '' & nbsp ; the worst beer in the uk would have to be tesco value [ link ] ( http://imgur.com/a/dotou ) . 
  you will lose your friends and be disowned by your family for drinking this, 
  quick everyone , let 's blame this guy for the turkish invasion !, 
  how do you even live with yourself ? 
  can confirm . 
  we brits have bases in their russian ~ ~ girls ~ ~ people, 
  would n't surprise me . 
  then again we 're all hunted , researched and watched here in the uk . 
  & nbsp ; i mean the united ^ ^ police ^ ^ state kingdom is safe and free ... and free !, 
  long live the queen !, 
  strong and stable * bangs desk *, 
  we need to get durham university into this and invite aldi , lidl and tesco value beans to take part in the test . 
  & nbsp ; i 'll give that you 're more likely more passionate than me as i have been known to also eat aldi baked beans but i honestly ca n't imagine branston being able to dethrone heinz, 
  awww hellllllllll nawwwwwwwww . 
  how would you rate the branston fart out of 10 ? 
  heinz is easily a 10/10 on the fart pong scale, 
  i just found it odd and humourous . 
  it 's a bear eating apples from a tree, 
  hah suck it blue !, 
  i mean red . 
  do n't talk shit about heinz baked beans , pal, 
  wtf spain ? 
  oh shit you 're right . 
  i honestly thought they adopted the st. patrick flag, 
  yeah , we 're all chavs, 
  you might get other european nationals meaning it in that way but it would be a very odd case if a brit was hinting at gypsies like that . 
  & nbsp ; although romani discrimination is a thing , its not exactly a * ` thing ' * in the uk, 
   full scale conventional war and that 's not something anyone wants to see the sad reality is that the eu would most likely avoid getting involved . 
  in `` we '' do you mean the anti-uk circlejerkers of this sub ?
