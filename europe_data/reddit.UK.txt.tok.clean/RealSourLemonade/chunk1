england would say that -_-, 
  no , because wales and england do n't want to be independent , however it looks like more powers will be devolved and maybe we will finally be on equal footing with scotland . 
   i guess it depends how long a generation is , but it 's not really their call to make . 
  if in 10 years there is a big surge of support for independence then they might have to have another one in 10 years . 
  actually it is , westminster decide what referendums happen , 10 years is far too soon for another nation wide election on the same thing . 
  the next election is going to be close whatever happens , if scotland leave i think it is very unlikely for labour to win . 
  normally it is not so close , however labour hav n't exactly had good pr these last few years . 
  with the election being on a knife edge these seats matter . 
  this would be true if scotland voted in the same ratio of party 's as england . 
  however they do n't , they vote heavily in favour of labour . 
  scotland leaving dramatically increases the chance of a conservative majority government . 
  the difference in votes between lab and con is so small , the effect of labour losing so many seats will be huge , unless they somehow pick up many more votes in other places . 
  this might be a long term trend but in the short term the conservatives will have an easy few elections . 
  either they will split and form two parties or another party will rise to challenge them eventually imo . 
   also an independent scotland could force the uk to involve itself more in the eu scotland is a labour stronghold . 
  the ruk would be much more right wing than the uk . 
  someone asked for a reason 2 hours before your first post and 5 hours before this one . 
  united kingdom of britain and northern ireland . 
   also , the eu military budget is about 1/3 of the u.s fair enough , i got my numbers wrong . 
  although this only strengthens the point i was making . 
   it seems you 're having some serious source problems . 
  or , you live in a movie . 
  122 , 860 that 's the total number of active armee de terre personnel . 
  combat represent about 20 % - 25 % of that . 
  source : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/forces_arm%c3%a9es_fran%c3%a7aises that 's about 30,000 ( generous estimate ) combat troops . 
  you are telling me the french army can deploy 70,000 , and `` anywhere '' . 
  add 6,000 marine national ( ultra generous ) and 3,000 armee de l'air . 
  ( same ) we still do n't reach 70,000 . 
  where you frozen in 1952 and they just thawed you ? 
  lmao you are so full of shit . 
  ** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union#the_table** both the uk and france have an active personnel list of around 200,000 . 
  of that for both approximatly 70,000 are ** land troops prepared for deployed operations ** . 
   i 'm done here . 
  well i suppose that 's one way to back out of defending your bullshit , 
   the question is how fast . 
  when it comes to a quite large intervention , setup quickly , only the u.s can do that at a large scale , because of these , these and those . 
  the question is not how fast , it 's how long and how far . 
  it depends on what you mean by large scale . 
  as i said , 70,000 is large and both the uk and france are capable of deploying around that many anywhere . 
  also the uk , france and the us are all a part of nato , as such the uk and france are short in the strategical aircraft area because the us has prioritized those . 
  if nato did not exist and we were n't such close ally 's with the us we would have many more of our own . 
  the us has by far the most power projection capabilities of any country , that is why i put it at the top of my power projection list ... 
  this is for two reasons . 
  the us has such a large military budget , it 's somewhat to be expected . 
  the eu ( if we take it as a whole ) has perhaps 50 % the military budget of the us , however it does not have 50 % the power projection capabilities , this is because many of the countries in the eu , during the cold war , built large standing armies , to defend against a possible soviet invasion . 
  for obvious reasons this is not something that would work for the us ( the atlantic dictates the us must be able to deploy troops over seas ) . 
  as such you have the us with the most power projection capabilities , followed by the uk and france . 
  china and india currently are expanding their capabilities in this area . 
   because of these , these and those .

  confirmation bias much . 
  if you actively search for something you are likely to find it . 
   the stereotypical view of the eu in the uk is that it is communist . 
  urm , no it 's not . 
   only the u.s and to a lesser extent russia have the transports and logistical power to put together an large intervention of troops and material . 
  this is wildly incorrect . 
  the uk and france individually have the capability to project more power than russia . 
  the uk and france can each deploy around 70,000 troops to practically anywhere on the planet . 
  russia would have trouble deploying 1000 men to anywhere not on it 's borders . 
  in terms of power projection the world rankings go . 
  uk , france 3 . 
  upcoming powers - china and india ( many carriers being built ) . 
   trying to sabotage anything that might hurt their beloved city and financial services industry and what about france with their agriculture and germany with their industry ? 
   europe has to offer without paying a single penny to it the uk is a net contributor to the eu . 
   since britain is european wether they like it or not the definition of continent is extremely loose . 
  by some of the accepted definitions the uk is not a part of europe but that 's just semantics . 
  you are a mess . 
  the french murdered countless innocent people as well as their king . 
  ** their ** armies did it for them oxymoronic . 
   the french undid all that and they brought the age of enlightment when they did no they did not . 
  if the french undid all rights of conquest then france would not exist . 
  the french actually used right of conquest to take the lands of their monarchy , it was not lawful to behead them lol . 
   arguably the singlemost important development to lead to the modern age i think not . 
  important ? 
  sure , singlemost important ? 
  and in regards to the topic of conversation the age of enlightenment is not a point against the monarchy , otherwise it would hardly have been endorsed by monarchs such as catherine of russia . 
  england 's claim on it 's land is by right of conquest . 
  same as the monarchy 's claim on it 's land . 
  same as most land in the world in actuality . 
  trying to undo all that is the quest of morons . 
  it 's fun to pretend that england is ` supposed ' to be a country , is n't it ? 
  deport them all and take their property , they stole it all afterall . 
  tourism alone is hard to tell . 
  however the revenue of the crown estates ( which are given to the government ) , exceed the amount given to the royal family by the state ( the civil list ) . 
  wales has newport . 
  i 'm not sure of the story , newport is just newport . 
  stalin would not have given poland back . 
  therefore the only method of freeing poland would be a military invasion . 
  so yes you are saying invading soviet russia . 
   doesnt help the fact that the majority prefers ru regime ah , so you have a source for this ? 
  one not given to you by a crimea occupied by russian soldiers that is . 
  of course you then have to raise the issue of the tartars , a minority now because when the soviets owned crimea they forcibly deported a large number of them to siberia , where many of them died . 
  any russian takeover if legitimate would have to give concessions to them ( assuming as a minority they did not agree to join russia ) . 
   look at a map lately ? 
  i think you forgot to set your map to population density . 
   the locals in crimea did not seem to be very unhappy about getting annexed by russia so that 's why so many of them refused to be apart of the illegal referendum ? 
  and those russian soldiers on the street definitely encouraged the citizens of crimea to vote as they wanted . 
  and lets not forget that this is a russian referendum , i mean we 've all seen putin 's election results , i 'm sure they are 101 % legit . 
  not really . 
   war was winnable in 1939 say a bunch of armchair generals .
