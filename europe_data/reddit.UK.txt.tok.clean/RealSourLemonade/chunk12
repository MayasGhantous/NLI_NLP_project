  federalization is way more than a decade away lol . 
  look at those sample sizes and its still a very close . 
  polls become more accurate the closer to the referendum you come . 
  at this point all these polls do is illustrate that there is a split , probably favouring the stay vote . 
   it 's not great for the out camp when you consider the barrage of in-priopaganda we 'll be hit with come 2017 . 
  as the spending and air time will be equal between the out and in , i expect it will be a lot more balanced than you expect . 
  i 'm talking about the democratic deficit . 
  a widely acknowledged flaw in the eu . 
  i 'm not going to have a 60,0000 page discussion with you about it , if you do n't believe in it , well good for you , millions of people however disagree . 
  and the exact same thing applies to you . 
  just because you want something does n't mean you are right . 
  the eu is not democratically accountable , unelected bureaucrats hold far far too much power . 
  45 / 35 split with 20 undecided is the most optimistic pro eu poll which is quoted at the top of this thread somewhere i believe . 
  when the campaigns start expect swings as in the scottish referendum . 
   i predict a future of great irrelevance for england . 
  uk - scotland = / = england twat . 
   a regional you know what regional is right ? 
   calling the uk a super power 5th largest economy in the world . 
  2nd best force projection capabilities in the world . 
  best chippies in the world . 
  the uk is definitely a world power . 
   scotland should stay though . 
  they had nothing to do with this . 
  they voluntarily joined the uk and in a free and fair referendum chose to stay in it . 
  so yes , they do have everything to do with this . 
  hey , i can provide a pretty simple explanation . 
  the uk pays more into the eu than it gets back . 
  the uk forgoes lucrative trade agreements with the developing world in order to take part in the protectionist eu . 
  the uk has no control over immigration of low skilled workers from the eu . 
  the uk has no control over its own waters in terms of fishing . 
  the uk has given up power to the eu without a fair referendum , without the mandate of the people . 
  the eu is not a democratically accountable organisation and yet it can dictate to us . 
  and also trade agreements with countries like china , brazil , india . 
  yes , that is what i said ... 
   not racist , but # 1 with racists . 
  and the conservatives are all pedophiles ...  they are a protofascist party imo . 
  what policy of theirs make you say this ? 
  are you sure your not just regurgitating the smear campaign against them ? 
  the rise of your euroskeptic party tells us that this is a lie . 
  it 's about a 50/50 split . 
   britain 's eu membership is far more lucrative than its contributions to the budget . 
  britain 's eu membership is an unnecessary drain on the country . 
  as we do n't appear to be backing up what we say i 'll leave it at that . 
   it seems unlikely to me that the tories will forego that advantage but we 'll have to wait and see !, 
  the bbc atleast is pretty much honour bound to be neutral . 
  / u/parameters is whitewashing the issue . 
  an in out referendum will be a very close and hard fought referendum . 
   every major uk party ( the conservatives included ) are for eu membership ** ( except ukip ) ** . 
  bbc broadcasting time and campaign budget will be split equally between the yes and the no i believe . 
  that the cons , lab and snp are pro does not necessarily give an advantage . 
   the management of pretty much every uk media organisation is pro eu membership . 
  not true . 
   every major uk industry is pro eu membership , including the influential financial sector . 
  not true , unless of course your talking about multinationals . 
   most importantly , far more uk voters want to stay in the eu than leave it the poll you link says 45 % to stay , 35 % to leave . 
  it 's a poll well before any campaign has even begun . 
  you are being extremely premature . 
   barring some colossal calamity , the chance that a 2016-2017 `` in / out '' referendum will result in an `` out '' , are somewhat over-blown . 
  there is a very good chance that the uk will leave the eu . 
  there is also a good chance it will stay . 
  it is going to be a close one , much like the scottish referendum . 
   so free movement of goods and services in a shared union , but restricted movement of people !, 
  free trade agreement = / = union . 
   the free movement of people has been a major factor in the lasting peace and prosperity of western europe the mass graves of the world wars , destruction of europe 's economic and military dominance , forced alliances of the cold war and advancing morals are responsible for peace in europe . 
   imagine i 'd the usa operated a merit system controlling movement if people between states !, 
  imagine if the usa and mexico had a controlled border ... oh wait . 
   does not apply to the nobility or wealthy . 
  what nobility lmao ... 
  yes the wealthy can pay their way in , having money is n't a crime . 
   it 's just frustrating because so much of the narrative here surrounding the independence debate focused on scotland 's place in the uk , and we were all assured that it did in fact , have a prominent place , but it 's now pretty clear that to many voters -- not least to the two major parties -- that place is out of sight out of mind . 
  the snp is not scotland . 
  scotland has a place in the running of the uk , the usual place has been as backing up labour but the snp 's aggressive rhetoric somewhat spoiled that . 
  until there is reform of the fptp system it is very hard for small parties to make a difference , the issue is of course extremely pronounced with ukip and the greens . 
  but this is n't a system aimed at making scotlands voice nill , it 's just an outdated system that needs to be updated . 
   when you 're fed six months of platitudes like `` do n't leave britain , lead britain '' only to be told that no , you 're in fact not allowed a role in leading britain , it can be pretty upsetting . 
  the snp have like 50 odd seats in the house of commons , that 's the 3rd biggest party , even though the snp do not have the 3rd most support . 
  this puts the snp in a very nice place if they want to expand upon the devolution that has already taken place in scotland . 
   to me it seemed to make it pretty clear that they felt they could serve the whole of britain should have toned down the scotland rhetoric then . 
   i feel like it leaves scotland 's position in the uk pretty clear . 
  the snp are the 3rd biggest party in the commons , if they want to become a uk party they have the springboard they need . 
  the system needs reforming but even as they are the snp is hardly voiceless , though the cons majority does deminish that in terms of actual power . 
  but thats what happens when the lib dems collapse , scotland goes all nationalistic aswell as the rise of ukip . 
  unpredictable majority governments happen . 
   but surely you can understand why people might not love the idea that they do n't matter . 
  i 'm from wales so ...  but they simply do n't have enough representatives to fulfill that mandate , i think it 's a pretty clear indication that those people are n't being represented , and that 's an issue . 
  yes , that is an issue . 
  but over representing to an absurd level the voice of scotland is not a solution . 
   now i know not all of that voting block wants independence independence should be out of every decent persons minds at this point ( not indefinitely ) . 
  trying to cheat the people who voted to stay in the uk by continual referendums is simply unethical . 
   and to me provides a compelling argument as to why more of it should . 
  yes , there should be more devolution . 
  but that has no bearing on the now , that is an issue for the future . 
  the now of it is that people do n't want the snp running labour . 
   and as an aside , i 'm clearly not purposefully trying to be obtuse . 
  if anything , you 're accusations could be considered obtuse . 
  you ignored my point and i had to repeat it . 
   no , freedom of movement is a core founding principal of the eu i did n't say it wasn ; t. . .  compared to that the current eu open door isnt a system , the complete absence of a system is not a system . 
   a class and/or privelige based system . 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's a ** merit ** based system .
