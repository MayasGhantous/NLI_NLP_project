  you are judged on your ** merit ** , on your skills and record as a person . 
  it really boggles my mind the depths of eu propaganda some people are willing to take as gospel . 
  you need us more than we need you at the end of the day , you sell us more than we sell you . 
  there are other markets , if iceland can find all the trade agreements it needs then i guarantee you that the worlds 5th largest economy can aswell . 
   i have to ask : as someone who believes the eu is seeking `` political dominion '' you question that the eu now desires further federalization ? 
  have you been in a dark closet for the past 50 years ? 
   a class/privelige based system a merit based system you mean . 
  more weasel words ? 
  really . 
  people arnt worried about scottish representation , they are worried about massive over representation that could have been possible if the snp controlled the lab majority . 
  do n't be purposefully obtuse and i wo n't call your words weasel words ... 
  i 'm curious , why do n't you like ukip ? 
   this uk parliament is likely the most eurosceptic ever . 
  have you heard of the conservative party ?!, 
  these people know how to be eusceptic !, 
  the conservative party are pro-eu and that 's on the record . 
  when the referendum comes around the cons will be campaigning to stay in . 
  please do n't sprout bullshit . 
   what 's the issue ? 
  it was made very clear that scottish independence was not something the snp were pushing as a major campaign issue , their campaign focused almost entirely on the same domestic issues as the other two parties . 
  in all the speeches it is made abundantly clear that the snp is about having scotland 's voice heard and it 's said in a very ` aggressive ' way . 
  yes the rise of nationalist parties is a major issue . 
   the narrative was very much `` anti-austerity for the whole of the uk , '' not `` fuck the english pigs . '', 
  the narrative was more like , we 'll give labour a backbone and you know the tories ? 
   if anyone was actually scared off by the notion of the snp in government , it was either for specific disagreements with the snp -- in which case i would definitely call them swing voters -- or shear ignorance . 
  or completely sane fears over whether or not the ** scottish national party ** , truly has the best interests of the uk at heart . 
   and if they were n't a swing voter , if they truly did simply believe that having the overwhelming mandate of the scottish people represented in government , then i think that says something about our union . 
  nice weasel words , you dodge the point quite nicely . 
  maybe we 'll see you in no. 10 one of these days . 
  in the case of a government of lab and the snp where the snp controlled the lab majority the scottish voice would be ** far ** stronger than the fair representation of the scottish voice in westminster . 
   france , and germany will again try to legislatively pull euro-based trading back into the eurozone , only this time without the uk to oppose them . 
  so trade in the city would shrink by maybe a quarter . 
  not true . 
   also , the commonwealth nations ( other than au/can/nz ) have currently no interest in any undertaking wherein `` the uk takes a leading role '' . 
  many nations in the commonwealth and out would be fine with free trade with the uk . 
  we do not seek political dominion as it seems the eu does . 
   an `` independent '' uk can essentially choose to be either an american or an eu satellite . 
  pfft , the 5th largest economy in the world doesnt need to orbit anyone . 
   in short , anyone who 's vote swung on this issue is definitely a swing voter . 
  it 's a major issue and one of a dynamic not normally addressed by the usual cons , lab dynamic . 
  so youre wrong . 
   then i think it 's pretty clear scotland should leave the union . 
  i think scotland referendum on the issue very clearly shows that the should not leave the union , anyone trying to cheat the people who voted to stay out of their voice should be ashamed of themselves . 
  the idea of an snp-lab coalition is no doubt pushing english voters away from labour . 
   you ca n't scapegoat the scots for this . 
  the scots voting for the snp has greatly reduced labour 's chance of being the next government . 
  thats not scapegoating , its a fact . 
  when labour lose seats to the snp , that means labour have less seats overall and so are further away from the number they need . 
  so yes , the snp 's surge is a big factor in the current results . 
  it 's not the only factor and i didnt say it was . 
   i suppose you could make the argument that the prospect of a labour-snp coalition scared swing voters into voting tory swing and dedicated voters . 
   it seems what 's mostly happened is tories winning seats lost by the lib dems . 
  i think its more than that though that no doubt takes a part . 
  to say that 15 % of a country is misguided based purely on your opinion is arrogant . 
  you can say they are wrong that is fine . 
  misguided implies that they do n't know who they are voting for and why , and that is just condescending . 
  this is not true . 
  a referendum on the uk leaving the eu is guaranteed by 2017 if the cons gain power . 
  it is one of their ` red line ' policies . 
  if they do n't then they are shooting themselves and labour in the face . 
  trust in the political class is at an all time low with the rise of the nationalists in the snp , plaid and ukip . 
   and they are still the voice of many people , ** misguided though that voice is . 
  ** such arrogance . 
  the uk would very possibly benefit economically from leaving the eu . 
  we 'd be able to trade with many more people and our trade with the eu is so valuable to them that an agreement with them would likely be very quickly made . 
  i wo n't vote for anyone who does n't guarantee a referendum on eu membership , i ca n't decide whether im pro eu or anti eu but i do know that a referendum is this countries democratic right . 
  would n't vote labour based on their track record or lib dems based on student loans anyway . 
  wo n't vote conservative do n't like political class . 
  wo n't vote ukip do n't trust them yet . 
  wo n't vote plaid or greens , they promise the world but ca n't deliver shit . 
  so i 'm not voting , 
   but after seeing what they did to / r/ukpolitics pfft . 
  this is such drivel . 
  the reason ukip people are so defensive on ukpolitics is because for a very long time they could n't speak there without being dismissed with offensive 1 liners . 
  that some of them keep up acting like that is no surprise . 
  ukip are against uncontrolled immigration . 
  they support a system of controlled immigration based on the australian points based system . 
  in that system people with skills will be allowed to immigrate , however people who are unskilled , or have a criminal record will no be allowed to immigrate . 
  they want to stop a tory government yet all theyve done is ensure one . 
  hardly a win win . 
   in fact , for younger people like me zero hours are a blessing . 
  and for younger people like me they are not . 
  lol . 
  the tory 's have done an alright job , they hav n't pulled an invade iraq on us so it 's not the worst possible outcome . 
  well i 'm vehemently anti-labour so no i did n't . 
  nice dodge btw , real good politicing skills you have their . 
  oh we 're doing historical revisionism are we ? 
  argentina has never had a legitimate settlement on the islands , the uk 's paper claim to the islands is much better than argentina 's . 
  the only illegitimate argentinian settlement on the islands was destroyed by the uss lexington on the grounds that the settlement was practicing piracy . 
  the illegitimate argentinian settlement was not even a single generation old and there is now a generations old british population on the islands . 
  the right to self determination clearly supports the islanders . 
   and 80,000 americans settle there this would be against the geneva convention which i believe the us is a signatory to . 
   islands literally on it 's doorstep are you kidding me ? 
  go look at a map . 
  if argentina have claim on the falklands by geographic distance then i 'm afraid the uk have claim on ireland , a large chunk of france , belgium and the netherlands . 
   that 's a horrible comparison . 
  why ? 
  both ideas completely ignore a peoples right to self determination . 
  or albion, 
  ukip are polling at around 17 % of the general election vote .
