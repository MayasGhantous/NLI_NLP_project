   no , but if you come here with your child-wife and the child you had with her , you should be arrested and punished . 
  because it is against the law here . 
   going to the philippines does n't mean you had sex with children . 
  it is against the law in the philippines for a stranger to be in a room alone with an underage person . 
  as you have broken this law , if you visit the philippines should you be arrested ? 
  if no , you position here is contradictory to your original position . 
   i 'm saying we should arrest and punish those who are married to children . 
  if children was actually a metric that would make sense , it is n't , it 's an arbitrary term . 
  they should be held to european law once they arrive , they should not be retroactively prosecuted with european law for entirely legal actions taken in their home country before they arrived here . 
   the proper protections for the young party put in place, 
  so if you visit the philippines you should be arrested on landing ? 
  for surely you have been in a room unsupervised with an underage girl before . 
   1 ) you talked about contributor , not about net contributor my first sentence makes it clear that i am talking about net contributions , every nation in the eu is a contributor to the eu . 
  i 'll give you i did n't technically specify , though it was there in the context . 
   2 ) your figures are from 2006 . 
  that 's nearly prehistory . 
  take actual figures and you will see france is a bigger net contributor ( not italy in this case ) where does it say they are from 2006 ? 
  on the page it says the population figures in the table above are from 2006-7 but nothing about the financial table . 
  further , your figures are from 2014 . 
  i have a source here : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/11221427/eu-budget-what-you-need-to-know.html from 2013 that show the uk ahead of france . 
  ** i 'd put to you then that either of us could be right , as of 2016 . 
  ** ( unless you can find a source for 2015 ? 
  i havnt been able to . ), 
  edit : ive edited my original comment to note the contention over this . 
  if you can show that france is a bigger contributor i 'll edit that in . 
   so youjust ignore the 250 years of war we had in europe ? 
  even befor hitler was here , very well this does n't make any sense what so ever as a response to my comment . 
  i 've explained the primary reasons why peace now reigns in europe . 
  i could explain the reasons those primary reasons exist , but then i 'd be writing an essay . 
   it does give us the right when they 're here . 
  from the point they arrive on wards yes , not to be retroactively applied to the time spent in their own countries . 
  no they do n't . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_statistics net contributions ( euro ) : uk : 5,445,700,046 france : 3,806,907,859 italy : 3,437,179,157 ** uk  france  italy **, 
   major countries go to war all the time , it seems . 
  major countries play at war all the time . 
   eu downt to those who really want to contribute so germany , france , italy , the netherlands , sweden , denmark , finland and austria . 
  the only contributors other than the uk . 
  the uk being the biggest contributor other than germany . 
  ( ** edit : ** there is contention on whether or not france is a bigger contributor than the uk )  it is not like that the eg/eu isnt the reason we havnt had a war in 70 years ... but hey fuck it . 
  we hav n't had a war in 70 years because : a ) horrific losses in ww2 changed europeans views on war . 
  b ) the soviet union gave the nations of europe a single enemy which they unified against . 
  c ) the proliferation of nuclear weapons meant a hot war with the soviet union was impossible , thus a cold war was fought . 
  d ) with the collapse of the soviet union the enemy has disappeared and all that is left is the unity . 
  this is why russia 's recent actions in ukraine are so threatening to the peace . 
  none of these are reliant on the eu , it is the other way around . 
  the eu has grown out of the peace , the peace has not come from the eu . 
  what a load of absolute crap . 
  that we arbitrarily term someone an ` adult ' at 18 does n't give us the right to judge other countries arbitrary judgement . 
  when they arrive their marriage should be terminated and the proper protections for the young party put in place , but the older party should n't be punished so long as they comply . 
  except your comparison is completely false . 
  if a shopkeeper cuts of a thiefs hand in his home country , which is legal there . 
  then is a refugee seeking asylum in europe . 
  so long as he now obeys european law , then he should not be punished for following the law of his home country when he was in his home country in the past . 
  from this point on he must follow european laws but they should not be retroactively applied . 
  german hegemony was the work of your fathers ? 
  i thought the netherlands fought with the allies ? 
   there is not a single european military with the capability to fight an extended war overseas on its own in its current condition we could , it would be a difficult job with the current setup , give us some time to setup . 
  as it 's an offensive war we have that time , and we 'd be fine . 
   because we ca n't police and defend our own backyard , we are so spineless and weak . 
  there is not a nation on earth that can invade the eu successfully . 
  if we ignore nukes the only nation with a chance in hell at doing that is the us and even then it 's a tall order . 
  russia would have to increase it 's military spending by around 5 times to gain parity with current eu military spending . 
   and is even being ranked higher than germany in some rankings . 
  germany spends $ 44bn on military . 
  poland spends $ 10bn on military . 
  german economy is much larger aswell . 
  in any prolonged engagement germany would wipe the floor with poland . 
   i do n't think they could be the second third and fourth strongest militaries . 
  i do n't think the russian and chinese militaries could pale that easily . 
  the russian military is already behind the uk and french militaries by a long way in quality . 
  they spend only $ 9bn more than the uk on military and their economy does n't have anywhere near the same depth to increase this as the uk does . 
  the chinese military is a better example . 
  though if you combine the militaries of the uk and france , it 's something closer to an even fight . 
  in any case the uk and france both have better power projection capabilities than china at the moment . 
  the uk could defeat a chinese invasion of europe on it 's own and china could defeat an invasion of far east asia by the uk + france . 
   that said i am fairly certain that if necessary germany could build a very strong military in very short time . 
  germany spends $ 43bn on military and has lots of economic depth so yes they very likely could . 
  in a race though they are very far behind and there are questions about the quality of their current forces that would need to be asked . 
  ah , i thought they were still at 1.9 % :p, 
  poland are very close to complying . 
  whilst i agree with most of your comment , your snipe about money is pretty unfair . 
   we spend 0.47 % of our gdp on immigrants , compared to britains 0.02 % the uk has given over # 1,000,000,000 to the syria crisis and is the second biggest contributor in the world . 
  per capita denmark has given around # 18 ( assuming the source i found that says denmark has given 1 billion kroner is accurate ) . 
  per capita the uk has given around # 15 . 
  the gdp per capita of denmark is about $ 60,000 -  # 41867 . 
  the gdp per capita of the uk is about $ 42,000 -  # 29313 . 
  so of each persons part of the gdp , a person from denmark has given : 0.043 % . 
  from the uk : 0.051 % . 
  in regards to the syria crisis the uk gives more in total and each person gives more as a percentage of gdp per capita . 
  as a country we set aside 0.7 % of our gdp for foreign aid . 
  we certainly pay enough foreign aid to have an opinion , thanks . 
  sure . 
  secede calais to us and we will show you how proper policing is done . 
  otherwise , get your shit in order and sort it out . 
   not only that , but because 100,000 is their claim of the fall in net immigration from the eu , it does n't consider that it might cause an increase in net immigration from elsewhere , or a decrease in emigration . 
  there are no laws saying we have to take immigrants from other places . 
  we can just set a cap . 
  the ` problem ' with eu immigration is we can not set restrictions , it is open borders . 
   this is the party that is currently headed by corbyn , right ? 
  yes , the labour party .
