   we need to crete europe of people , of individuals , not the europe of nations trying to force this issue will only split us further apart . 
  give it a few centuries of friendly cooperation before you try and mash people together . 
   and certainly not the europe of `` sovereigns '' . 
  trust is n't built via rushed , badly planned integration . 
   there 's a parliament , there 's a council . 
  your represented there . 
  under represented and with little power . 
   and of course you do n't get 1/28 of european deputies of course ? 
  want to justify this ? 
   and in the council of course the stronger countries will have more influence . 
  but if all the 27 disagree with the uk it wo n't have much of a chance . 
  and as you disagree with us on near everything important there is little point us being in union . 
   you got an opt out of the euro and of schengen . 
  that is a pretty big deal . 
  not really . 
  what is special is the eu 's absurd push for the euro . 
  we could join schengen and you 'd still need to show you passport when you got on a plane , train or ferry to the uk . 
  it 's security . 
   you do have your share of influence in the union . 
  please show me where ? 
  even if we did have a proper 1/28th influence on the eu that still would n't be democratic . 
  we have a population of 60million , having the same influence as a country with a population of 5 million is ludicrous . 
   and you do think you 're special . 
  germany get 's free trade . 
  france get 's the cap , where is our common banking area ? 
  of the big three we have the least special treatment . 
   which is why you pushed to obtain opt outs other countries would have no chance in hell of getting . 
  every country which contributes as much as we do has the same chance to get opt outs . 
  it 's a political union which we have no influence on . 
  why would we want to be in such a union , we believe in democracy . 
  how about when we suggest reform the immediate reaction of every federalist is n't to aggressively attack us for thinking we are ` special ' . 
   they already have enough strange deals going on with their banking sector . 
  freedom of movement , freedom of trade and yet no freedom of banking . 
  integration wherever it wo n't help the uk that is the eu 's motto . 
  why would we rely on russia . 
  their military is piss . 
  the uk or france could take them in a conventional war . 
  the uk and france would roll over them . 
   `` ok , england , you are kicked out of the union , scotland is welcome and can start using euro from midnight . 
  england , you can get back when ireland is reunited , wales free and you get trough regime change . '', 
   ok , england , you are kicked out of the union westminster is the government of the whole uk , not england . 
   scotland is welcome and can start using euro from midnight scotland do n't want the euro , they are currently under the scottish ** nationalist ** party and they are subservient to westminster . 
  further it has n't even been reliably shown that they will vote to stay in the eu . 
   england , you can get back when ireland is reunited the un charter would like to have a few words with you about peoples right to self-determination . 
  fascist . 
   wales free and you get trough regime change no , thanks . 
  we 'll trust england over the eu any day of the week . 
   frankly , i do n't think we have enough time to get there by peacefull means . 
  to many sparks of hate is flying over that spilled fear . 
  in which direction will resulting violence shall go , what form it will take - it is ( and probably will be until it starts ) too soon to tell . 
  will europe fall apart or be bond with that probably depends on the fact if people who prefer europe as a real country be able to organize themselves before it starts . 
  this is hilarious scaremongering . 
  the only threat to the eu outside of mad , is people like you thinking the eu can stomp all over other countries sovereignty . 
   uk wants more special treatment . 
  when we argue for our position it 's special treatment . 
  when you do it it 's ` natural path of the eu ' . 
  see that is what a union should be built on , mutual hatred , 
   first they come to save belgium . 
  saving belgium does n't sound very isolationist and if we accidentally save france along the way , well so be it !, 
   the second time they were hugely helped by their future american overlord . 
  well we could n't rely on any european power apart from ourselves and germany to show competence so unfortunately we had to hire in the usa on a zero hour contract . 
  perhaps in the next war france 's military strategy and tactics wo n't be 10 years behind the competition , eh . 
   i get it tho , like most politicians he is turning the eu into a punchbag for domestic support david cameron is pro-eu . 
   but why not try to work on a solution instead , especially if his country is considered one of the `` leaders '' of eu he has come asking for paltry demands , the people he is trying to convince to join the pro-eu side think his demands are too small and the eu is coming back and saying his demands are too big . 
   unfortunately it 's true . 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's just an easy way for you to dismiss the views of people who disagree with you . 
   even on this sub most brexit supporters do n't know jackshit about the things they demand to change . 
  on this sub half the time when the case for brexit is made it is made by a pro-eu person and made badly . 
  you want to hear the case made properly go somewhere like / r/ukpolitics . 
  rapidly bring them to a close . 
  good idea . 
  success . 
  democratic legitimacy . 
  ability to reform . 
   but the process ireland went about making this change is a lot more progressive and democratic than how the uk legalised it gays are a minority group . 
  ireland required a majority vote , to guarantee gay rights . 
  a ** majority ** vote to guarantee the rights of a ** minority ** . 
  yeah , no . 
  ireland 's way of doing this is wrong . 
   ireland -  progressive government pick one . 
   uk will isolate itself make it look like they fight all the war . 
  \\  saves france from occupation by germany 2 times . 
  \\  isolate self \\  \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   the basic economic principle of comparative advantage would disagree with this . 
  economic theories mean nothing if you do n't back them up . 
  comparative advantage is usually applied to free trade . 
  saying what you have said on it 's own is n't a rebuttal . 
   as far as i can see , the educational system in the east creates a rather sizable surplus of mathematicians quants , so one can just apply the david ricardo model to that you ca n't apply the ricardian model because one of it 's main assumptions is that the labour force is not internationally mobile . 
  and also it is an equilibrium model . 
  ee mathematicians may come here , our manual labourours wo n't go to ee . 
   and anyways , if i 'm the brainiest quant around , i 'd probably want to live where-ever i damn well please . 
  the restriction of people moving away was part of what made east-germany suck in the first place . 
  and `` needing for the people to stay '' was actually the rationale for the berlin wall in the fist place . 
  sometimes you have to face hard truths . 
  and anyhow i 'm not arguing for complete lockdown of movement of workers , i 'm arguing for controlled movement of workers until rough parity at which point i 'm for free movement of workers . 
   so , at a very minimum , it is n't very likely that east germans would be convinced that this is a good idea . 
  just because the majority think something does n't mean they are correct . 
  also i think with the right support package and good marketing this would have been perfectly sell-able before freedom of movement . 
  are both fruits and directly comparable .
