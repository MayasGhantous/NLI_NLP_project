  my mistake , although the echr is hardly comparable on scope to the eu . 
   again , the ec to the eu . 
  the european communities , and the european economic community , are not the same . 
  the latter was a part of the former , and it 's the former we joined ? 
   the united kingdom referendum of 1975 was a post-legislative referendum held on 5 june 1975 in the united kingdom to gauge support for the country 's continued membership of the european economic community ( eec ) ,  i 'm saying the aims of the ec and eu are fundamentally the same . 
  okay , well i am saying that i disagree and a large portion of the population disagree . 
  the eu has a much more ` federal ' air about it . 
   subservient ? 
  uh , by your reasoning , surely all treaties put us under the control of foreign powers . 
  treaties that let a government other than ours dictate laws to us . 
  the only such organisation is the eu . 
   oh come on . 
  it what practical way have the aims changed ? 
  the changing of the eec to the eu is a statement of amended aims in and of itself . 
  if you are saying the eu has no political aims i suggest that you are being deliberatly obtuse . 
   the referendum was for the ec , of which the eu is the successor . 
  it was not for the eec alone . 
  the changes are really not as great as you seem to feel they were . 
  they were significant enough to warrant a new treaty . 
  they were significant for the roi to have a referendum . 
  and anyhow to not have a referendum raises the concern of a creeping loss of sovreignity . 
   well , it is how we sign all supranational treaties , no ? 
  not ones where we make ourselves subservient to foreign powers no . 
   in what way are they different ? 
  all clauses of the treaty of lisbon for one . 
   huh , fair enough . 
  i do n't think the public were really misled , though . 
  the eec within the ec was indeed a common market . 
  it was also a single market . 
  a single market is just a common market with more regulation . 
  if the eu is only a single market then it 's powers far overstep it 's needs . 
   again , were the public really misled ? 
  the eec within the ec was indeed a common market . 
  it was also a single market . 
  i do n't think you could possibly suggest that people would n't think that it was a binding , supranational agreement . 
  it 's not binding . 
  infact there were so many concerns over the loss of sovreignity due to the treaty of lisbon that a formal withdrawl clause was added . 
  the referendum was fine for the eec , it is n't fine for the eu though . 
  interestingly enough i am pro eu . 
  i just find the fascist side of the pro eu ` team ' to be repugngent . 
  the eec was exactly what it says : an economic community of european nations . 
  and it was advertised as such in the uk referendum of 1975 . 
   all they lost were vetos . 
  which , frankly , were inevitable after the 2004 expansion . 
  which , as you will no doubt be aware , the uk parliament voted for as is obvious parlimentary approval is no sufficient for eu legitimacy . 
   er , not the eec . 
  we joined the european communities . 
  the ec 's aims are the same as that of the eu . 
  no they are not . 
   edit : wait , free trade area ? 
  the eu is not and never has been that , but was also not marketed as such . 
  they said `` common market '' , not `` customs union '' or `` free trade agreement '' . 
  well someone does n't know what a common market is . 
  hint : it 's you . 
   a common market is a first stage towards a single market , and may be limited initially to a free trade area with relatively free movement of capital and of services , but not so advanced in reduction of the rest of the trade barriers . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_market -  i 'm not really against a referendum when it comes down to it . 
  i just fear for the consequences when a misled public heads to the polls . 
  ah just like the 1975 referendum . 
   right . 
   i 'd like to point out that the lisbon treaty changed very little . 
  it made the eu more democratic by giving the parliament more power and made more decisions be done by majority vote instead of unanimity , due to the sheer practical implications of the 2004 expansion . 
  how , exactly , is this a bad thing ? 
  it has n't changed the substances of the eu . 
  not at all . 
  loss of powers of member states including veto 's on certain areas . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_lisbon#impact - -  it said `` aims '' , not `` substance '' . 
  the uk joined under the impression those were the aims of the eec , it is clear that these are not the only aims of the eu . 
  the eec is not the eu . 
   because for it to be a single market , there have to be uniform laws . 
  otherwise , it is a mere customs union . 
  hence , federalism . 
  no , agreeing to a freetrade area with a few common regulations does not infer a federal government . 
  - it 's people like you who are the only argument that holds water to me for us not being in the eu , if the pro eu side is so anxious to deny countries their democratic right to vote on their membership i ca n't see getting closer to you as a good thing . 
  you deleted an important adjective rendering your statement null . 
  there is a big distinction between a european economic community and a european political community . 
  the uk did not vote to join the epc , it voted to join the eec . 
   in grammar , an adjective is a ` describing ' word ; the main syntactic role of which is to qualify a noun or noun phrase , giving more information about the object signified economic community ** economic **, 
  well i 'll spin your own words against you for a start . 
   do you think the uk should stay in the european community ( ** common market ** ) ? 
  the european communities was a political union ( as was the eec , really ) , by nature . 
  it offered a single market , and so inherently meant a federal law system now that that 's out of the way you can explain just how you think a common market implies federal political control . 
  hint : it does n't . 
   was it ? 
  in what way ? 
  it was fairly clear to me : - government issue pamphlet explaining the aims of the eec :  the aims of the common market are :  to bring together the peoples of europe . 
   to raise living standards and improve working conditions . 
   to promote growth and boost world trade . 
   to help the poorest regions of europe and the rest of the world . 
   to help maintain peace and freedom . 
  strangely i do n't see anything about a political union , the treaty of lisbon clearly overstepped the mandate of the 1975 referendum . 
   http://www.harvard-digital.co.uk/euro/pamphlet.htm#5  sure , but people are n't calling for a lisbon referendum , that 's long-gone . 
  they 're calling for a referendum on leaving the eu . 
  saying no to the lisbon treaty is leaving the eu . 
  well someone has n't heard of the treaty of lisbon . 
  1 ) the referendum for the eec was heavily mis-advertised . 
  2 ) it was a referendum for an economic union not a political union . 
  3 ) if the treaty of lisbon was suggested today ( assuming it had not already been passed ) the uk gov would be required by law to hold a referendum . 
  that is how big an issue it is , because of it the need for a referendum was put into law . 
  any further steps will require referendum although many still think we should rectoactivly hold one for the treaty of lisbon . 
  i agree with that and i am pro-eu .
