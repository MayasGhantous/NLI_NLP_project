   but you voted for your government officials , when you vote people into office you vote that their decisions hopefully reflect your own . 
  we do n't live in an ideal world , in an unideal system corrective methods such a referendums have a place . 
   actually it has more influence . 
  if a nation leaves and they have left a sour taste in the eu 's mouth that can have huge repercussions on business . 
  that 's what i just said ...  so you join and leave things like the un , but integration heavy entities like the eu you upon membership accept that your are giving up a lot of freedom . 
  yes those are the cons i mentioned ... 
  the freedom to measure them against the pros is not something we give up , and we may act on our own measure as we see fit . 
  the eec the european economic community economic community ** economic **, 
  no , we measure our own membership by our standards , if we do n't like what we are getting it is our prerogative to leave . 
  in the end the opinion of people from other countries only matters as it always has in terms of international relations , they have no power or right to dictate to us that we stay . 
  our membership of the eu is controversial to us because we did not have a referendum and thus the eu lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many people . 
  the pro 's and con 's of our membership are ours to measure . 
  just what are you trying to say -_-, 
  no , i am saying kowtowing to russia when they are being aggressors is a bad idea and as we have the means not to do it we should employ those means . 
  if the people of crimea want to join russia that is fine , they can have a referendum when not at gunpoint to confirm it though . 
  moral outrage + harsh economic sanctions = russia backing up . 
  clear discussions do n't happen when you invade other countries , a clear discussion will only happen if russia stops antagonizing the situation . 
   i see russia annexing a region without facing serious internal resistance and quite a bit of support , and say that it should be viewed on those terms what sort of internal resistance do you expect ? 
  on the russian border with russian military bases inside and on the streets ? 
  all i am saying as that i will view a land grab as a land grab unless it has been demonstrated via ** fair ** referendum that the people wish for that change , although this only holds for normal areas , as crimea 's population was ` artificially ' changed during the rule of the ussr there should be special consideration to the ` natives ' . 
  ( similar morale problem to that of northern ireland ), 
  the united kingdom of england and wales just doesnt sound as good though . 
  all of my what, 
   it seems most people in crimea are at-least apathetic to the situation , if not fully supportive . 
  if this is so then why would russia not force a fair referendum ? 
  heck if it is so clear cut why not invite people to oversee it . 
  i use both interchangeably . 
  i thought we were only counting planes that can actually fly ? 
  i am struggling to see how the countries that make the internet possible can be enemies of the internet ? 
  they 'd have to build the pipelines first ... 
  not at all . 
  because russia ( ussr ) forcefully moved the native population and implanted it 's own population in crimea it is a ` muddy ' moral question . 
  similar to northern ireland , its not so cut and dry as ` majority rules ' . 
  russian controlled ballot boxes are notoriously fair / s the process should be overseen by all interested parties . 
  crimea ukraine russia is this what is happening or . . ? 
  http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73096000/jpg/_73096230_c0163063-european_nitrogen_dioxide_emissions,_2008-spl.jpg looks like nitrogen oxide emissions match almost perfectly with population density , who would have thought ? 
  if that huge red splodge on the continent is n't fined then neither should we be . 
  if the eu wishes to encourage more ` greenness ' they should allocate some of the # 40bn we contribute to the task . 
  timetravellers kill hitler , then if someone rises to replace him , kill him too ... 
  because the monarchy 's power is all symbolic and there is no mainstream support for their removal perhaps . 
  the eu is not symbolic and there is mainstream pro and against opinions . 
  we give switzerland stuff they give us stuff , they stop giving us stuff we stop giving them stuff . 
  clearly if we use punishment the way you are then switzerland are punishing us for no reason . 
   what is our best interest is to continue to collaborate with the swiss as much as they allow us to . 
  this is called a one sided relationship , they are not very beneficial to us . 
  nope , you are projecting malicious intent into a considered reaction . 
  was your 5 year course all on the beginning of wwi ? 
   beyond that , i 'm not really interested in keeping up this discussion . 
  for someone who has studied history you 're sure quick to call the people you 're debating with ignorant , or say things like `` the propaganda machines have clearly been whirring in your head '' , or claims of obvious bias . 
  and your sure quick to project motive that was not evident at the time onto events as-well as looking at things from a purely entente perspective . 
  this is hilarious . 
   we made contrary claims about what is `` well accepted '' by most historians , how are we going to settle that question without asking actual historians ? 
  i am not an expert , and neither are you . 
  if you want to back your point up using / r/askhistorians please do so , i do n't need to because i 've done a 2 year course on the matter , as should have everyone who 's gone through the uk education system . 
   since you insist , though , it 's really quite simple . 
  russia only started mobilizing after austria-hungary had declared war on serbia , which they only dared do because they were explicitly told that the germans would support any action , including war . 
  just a few days prior to this , russia had supported calls for a peace convention to settle the matter without war . 
  you seem to be ignorant of this message from the kaiser to austria-hungary after a reply to the austrian-hungarian ultimatum . 
   ` the reply amounted to a capitulation in the humblest style , and with it there disappeared all reason for war ' . 
   - kaiser wilhelm ii austria-hungary were a great power of europe in their own right and not the lapdogs of germany as you seem to be making out . 
   you asked `` what reason did france have for mobilizing '' , which shows you do n't have your time-line right . 
  france only started mobilizing after germany , and after germany had refused to guarantee belgium 's safety . 
  germany 's plan to go through belgium to attack france was n't exactly a secret at this point . 
  youre stuck looking at things from the ententes perspective i see . 
  germany mobilized on july 31st when russia refused to un-mobolize . 
  france mobilized one day later . 
  germany is now facing a war on two fronts , one which it had ardently been trying to avoid under the command of chancellor bismarck . 
  their plan for dealing with this is to take out france quickly , however the french have formidable defences and so a route through belgium is a must . 
   in short , the facts are clear . 
  germany , fuelled by the military-industrial complex , gave their full support to austria-hungary to start a war in the balkans which they knew would draw russia in . 
  germany declared war on russia and france ; not the other way around . 
  germany invaded neutral belgium , activating a very clear and well-known british obligation to intervene . 
  pfft , the propaganda machines have clearly been whirring in your head . 
   germany is not fully to blame , as they claimed at versailles , but they were more to blame than any other nation . 
  pfft , because they supported their ally and later advised against war ? 
  because the alliance system pushed them into an untenable position in which a pre-emptive strike was the only possible way to hold the initiative ? 
  germany mobolized because russia mobolized because austria-hungary declared war on serbia . 
  if someone holds a loaded gun to your head what do you do ? 
  you get out your own gun , but what if the person holding a gun to your head has a friend behind you who has n't drawn his gun yet ? 
  if you go for the guy infront of you then the guy behind you will shoot you , but you know the person infront of you is slow , your only hope is to take out the person behind you before they are ready and then turn round onto the person infront of you and hope to beat him to the draw . 
  placing such a large amount of blame on germany is to be blind and is one of the major contributory factors to wwii . 
  you are taking the answer that first came into your mind and assuming it is the only one . 
  one argument could be that , as the eu is an agreement between 28 nations , that letting a precedent be set that you can short change the eu is more damaging than trade with switzerland . 
  there are plenty of reasons people could make . 
  trade is a two way deal , if one party does n't wish to trade that is that , wto can do shit all . 
  nice misconstruing . 
  the eu is well within its rights to renegotiate now that switzerland has decided it can not meet its obligations under the treaties . 
  free trade is not a right , if the eu decides that it no longer wishes for free trade with switzerland then that is their choice . 
  this is an extremely unlikely scenario but no one is required to give others free trade . 
  renegotiating trade deals would be a form of equalling the agreement , depending on how much the deals change and how much value we place on freedom of movement . 
  nice duckout , so you ca n't make a conclusive argument and are appealing to others to try and make it for you ? 
  if you want to make a / r/askhistorians thread feel free to , link in reply if you do . 
  no it 's not . 
  you seem to be hanging your entire point on the blank cheque . 
  the blank cheque is at best a minor point . 
  make a conclusive argument that supports your point or stop letting your wwii bias 's decide your opinion for you . 
   so let 's put aside all this nonsense of not entering negotiations because the eu can hurt switzerland more , which quite clearly is an attempt at bully boy tactics . 
  i have 500 jammy dodgers , you have 4 twixes . 
  the trade matters more to you than it does to me . 
  by taking out 50 % of the trade you are losing 12.5 % of your trading capacity .
