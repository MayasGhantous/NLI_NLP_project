  i am only losing 0.1 % of my trading capacity . 
  therefore an equal measure affects each party differently , so what some users are suggesting is that it hurts the swiss far more than it hurts the eu when treaties are re negotiated . 
  the interpretation is based off of what happened , if the interpretation matters that implies the event matters . 
  it 's strictly factual but implies that the ` missile shield ' is to protect europe . 
  edit : also it would have been better if the uk just build 12 type 45 's instead of 6 . 
  a treaty is an agreement between two or more parties . 
  if i offer you two jammy dodgers for a twix and you say yes , then i only give you one jammy dodger , is it fair for me to get the whole twix ? 
  the answer is no , at most it would be fair for me to have half the twix . 
  therefore if someone wishes to back out of part of a treaty , then something should be withheld that is of equal value to them . 
  it 's not about bully boy tactics , its about being fair and keeping our word . 
  which is completely ignoring the alliance systems that were built up . 
  germany 's blank cheque to austria-hungary was a mistake , but if austria-hungary had acted quickly instead of sending an ultimatum and waiting for a month it is doubtful whether russia would have stepped in , the tsar being very anti-royal-assassination . 
  what reason did france have for mobilising ? 
  that they could have been attacked by germany ? 
  clearly the same logic dictates that germany should mobilise when russia mobilises . 
  it is well accepted that germany received far too much of the blame for wwi . 
  nice way to completely misconstrue what he 's said . 
  nato = / = europe, 
  funny that , and here i was getting taught by british schools that the start of wwi is very complex and blame ca n't be placed solely on any one party and that the treaty made after the war was very unfair and partly to blame for wwii . 
  but no clearly history does n't matter . 
   nor did germany have to declare war on russia , and then france . 
  nor did they have to invade france through neutral belgium , bringing britain into the war . 
  not necessarily true . 
  french and russian mobilisation practically forced germany to act , at this time mobilisation was tantamount to a declaration of war , if germany allowed russia and france to fully mobilize it knows it had no chance , therefore the only action possible is pre emptive action , visa vi invasion through belgium to take france out of the equation before they can become a threat . 
  if by failing miserably you mean have 10 % of the vote and could do better ? 
  the only thing being so bias and dismissive of them does it gives them more supporters . 
   from who ? 
  there 's no such identity . 
  there 's no shared `` eastern european '' culture nor history . 
  `` eastern european '' is only used by some western europeans ( which is an actual identity ) as a catch-all term for `` those weird people from those weird countries i do n't know much about '' . 
  do n't lump yourself with other people you have almost nothing in common with just because you 're apparently ashamed of being romanian . 
  the shared common history is which side of the iron curtain you ended up behind during the cold war , which is further enhanced by the disparity in wealth , there is nothing wrong with being a part of eastern or western europe , and perhaps the term will start to die out when we are all members of the eu for a while . 
  pfft . 
  ok kid . 
  and you seem to have said nothing in that entire spew of shit . 
   gives the rest of europe a bad name you mean gives europe a bad name with american gun nuts , not really a group anyone should want to appeal to . 
   however under our rather draconian european laws in europe you are free to walk down the street , in the us you are free to walk down the street whilst someone shouts at you because of your skin colour . 
   essentially , any kind of bigotry is hate speech and can be persecuted . 
  considering that his laws against the jews were ` kill them all ' two of those statements are completely unacceptable and the middle one probably would n't see you in trouble only because of the simplicity of it . 
   that is not a society of free speech . 
  a truly free society does not have truly free speech . 
  when others are free to discriminate against you based on something you can not control then you are not free . 
   `` man , ever since the poles started immigrating to ireland , we 've really seen an increase in irish unemployment and a rise in crime . 
  maybe we should n't let them in ? '', 
  - bam , hate speech . 
  haha no , if this was true then the entirety of ukip and the bnp would have been arrested . 
   well , we 'll never know , because it 's illegal to discuss due to the implications . 
  it looks like you 've got all of your information from 15 year olds on reddit . 
   if you think that 's out of this world , all you need to do is look at liberal parts of the usa and see the social framework , it emulates precisely what i just said , just that it is not written into law . 
  so it 's not far fetched at all to see shit like that happen in the future as long as our constitutions do not provide for an unwavering , unabridged , freedom of political and religious expression . 
  your constitution is to make up for the fact that you do n't have hundreds of years of history to fall back on , in the uk we have a ` de-facto ' constitution . 
  you are free to worship who you want and say what you want , as long as that does not include unfairly discriminating against someone because of some random fact about them . 
  the us where big businesses are worshipped as god is a minority on it 's outdated version of freedom of speech . 
  the israel palestine situation is incredibly complex , i would say for a start israel needs to back off and recognize palestine . 
  if we apply some of the ` rights ' that my society ` hold ' to the situation then you can probably make a case for both palestinians and israelies having ` rights ' to live in israel etc. 
   the uk should stop starting wars which are not sanctioned by the un . 
  the un , famously a body of equality and good intentions with russia , china and the us on the permanent security council ... 
  umm the nuremberg trials were famously unfair . 
   since the uk ca n't take independent military action urrr yes it can . 
   i 've been diametrically opposed to the actions of the us . 
  uk and france in syria since 2011 . 
  you were opposed to us not intervening in syria ?? 
   my statement was n't support for their illegal and completely and utterly disgusting action in syria . 
   it was about camerons lack of ability to do what he wanted . 
  tony blair set a precedent that the pm did not need to ask the commons to take military action , cameron did a very good thing by asking the house even if he lost some prestige by losing the vote . 
   when the best opportunity he had was available , he failed to get the yes vote . 
  it was the fear of iraq and tony blair that got the no vote , nothing to do with the mps or the british public realising the reality of syria . 
  it was petty politics by ed milliband and the unwillingness of the uk citizens to police the world . 
  rights are a imaginary construct ( like the value of money ) , you have a ` right ' to what land you can hold , as our society holds this land anyone our society accepts has a ` right ' to live here . 
  in the uk if you grow up here , you are british . 
  hate speech is not covered by freedom of speech , it is the context that makes this ` okayish ', 
  no , we subsidise our own crops to keep them more competetive . 
   again , where are the missiles that nato has deployed in ukraine ? 
  they are n't there because they were n't deployed . 
  and they were n't deployed because russia ** strongly ** objected . 
  the rest of what you are saying is irrelevant to the discussion ... 
   you said that russia had placed troops on ukraine 's eastern border . 
  that does n't seem very peaceful to me . 
   that 's what this debate is about no , we are talking about your original comment . 
  russia may have malign motives , on the otherhand just assuming that that is the case is n't right . 
  we could just offer a fair deal to some african nations if europe really felt like embargoing our food ... 
   but we 're not arguing about whether or not it is provocative to place missiles in ukraine , we 're arguing over whether or not they have the right to allow missiles there , and as a sovereign country they do . 
  it 's also important to note that the missile system proposed was not a us system , it was a nato system , and it was also a defensive system , not an offensive one . 
  if your neighbor buys a gun and starts hanging out with a group of people who do n't like you is it any of your concern ? 
  the ukraine has a right to arm itself etc , as russia has a right to be concerned , annexation would no doubt be a bit of an overstep to say the least . 
  mutually assured destruction works because it is ** mutually ** assured , if one side builds a missile shield it will spark an arms race . 
  in the long term a missile defense system poses a bigger threat to russia than a conventional military force , seeing as russia could deal with a conventional force conventionally or nuclearly . 
  article 1 of the united nations charter of which the us is a signatory . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_charter  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination if a large group of people , say a state wish to leave the us , then they will do so with or without the us 's permission , this is legal under international law and is morally fine . 
  the us may choose to ignore such facts , this is not the issue we are talking about . 
  although it would be extremely ironic if the us ( formed by revolution ) chose to ignore it 's own citizens right to self determination . 
   states in general do not allow territories or regions to unilaterally declare themselves independent ( there are rare exceptions ) ; the us is no different . 
  if the majority of people in texas wished to be independent of the us and the us was not accommodating to that wish ( i.e having a referendum as is currently happening in scotland ( in the uk ) ) then texas could secede without ` us ' permission , this would be entirely legal because of the right to self determination , no matter what the us government may wish . 
  the right to self determination overrules that . 
  if a large enough portion of the texan population decided they wished to be independent then they could make it so , any action by the us government to stop them would be illegal . 
  just like when russia had the express permission of the cuban government to place missiles their ? 
  actions do n't happen in a vacuum , placing us missiles in ukraine is provocative to russia . 
  lets not pretend otherwise . 
   i am american , and no american state has the right to unilaterally secede from the union actually they do . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination whether or not the federal-government would allow such is another issue .
