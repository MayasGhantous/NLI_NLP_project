  it 's weird because it says the rate has fallen , but locally our unemployment as gone up . 
  i mean scotland does n't have a veto on anything the uk does as one . 
  but hitler was n't the leader , he was made the chancellor . 
  i just googled the way hitler came to power and actually he kind of circumvented the democratic process . 
  it 's still the same , even if they do leave the uk they will still have to reapply , plus there number one export/import market is the rest of the uk , so if the uk does n't get a free trade agreement that 's even worse for them , they are truly better off staying . 
  they had to be bailed out by the uk , they were is a similar position to spain and italy . 
  areas are not reliant on the eu , the eu contributes to projects and such , it does n't run entire areas , projects and schemes the uk could decide to fund instead and perhaps even create jobs just for uk residents rather than having to open up contract bids to the rest of europe as well . 
  i did n't say anything about denying them a ref , i said if they left the uk they would have to reapply to the eu under the eu 's terms and conditions . 
  remind me again why the uk is a net contributor rather than a net receiver ? 
  umm more like less reasons , it wants to stay in eu based on what the uk currently has , it wo n't have that it 'll have a worse position , the euro will and always will be a bad currency and taking part of the uk 's debt will mean it 'll be in a deficit from the off coupled with the fact it then has to take part of the eu 's debt to and pay in for schemes it 'll be screwed . 
  he did n't mention the possibility of negotiating a totally separate deal , all his points were anti brexit , he did n't mention the difficulty of scotland leaving and thus having to reapply under new conditions and the possibility of veto . 
  scotland ca n't leave the uk and still be in the eu , it 'll have to reapply and it wo n't have any of the uk 's original opt outs or concessions and it 'll have to have the europe and retain part of the uk 's original debts with financiers . 
  there 's nothing i can say that has n't been said before , it 's a tragedy and i 'm so sorry it happened :(, 
  the idea is angela wo n't be in a favourable position for us as she 'll need to be seen to be `` fighting '' during any brexit negotiations where as after the vote she 'll have more room to manoeuvre . 
  do n't worry i do n't pretend to be a mastermind or an expert in economics , i 'm just going off what i 've read and stuff i 've looked deeper into , if you want to make it personal then fine but i was just trying to present what i thought on the issue with what i could to back it up . 
  plenty of educated people also voted to leave to , it 's a myth that all leavers are uneducated old people . 
  4 % you mean , 48 % voted remain , 52 % voted leave , that 's 4 % difference and over 1 million people . 
  we joined the eec , you know what that stands for ? 
  if it was 50 % brexit would n't be happening . 
  probably after germany elections . 
  another article on it as well  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/03/french-plot-to-topple-city-of-london-is-foolish-bluster/, 
  ft article on the threats of stealing the financial sector from london . 
   one of the shadows hanging over the city of london is whether it will lose its highly-prized business of clearing euro-denominated derivatives . 
  it has around 70 per cent of the business while the nearest competitor , paris , holds just 11 per cent , according to 2013 data from the bank of international settlements . 
  those fears may be realised especially since fran\u00e7ois hollande , the president of france , spelt out his view . 
  `` the city , which thanks to the eu , was able to handle clearing operations for the eurozone , will not be able to do them , '' he said this week . 
  `` it can serve as an example for those who seek the end of europe . 
  it can serve as a lesson . '' this threat too easily simplifies a complex relationship between trading and location across global markets . 
  there are solid reasons to believe that these calls will be counterproductive and consequently , not acted upon . 
  clearing houses manage credit risk in the event one party in a swap deal defaults . 
  london has become a world leader for the clearing of all types of currency-denominated derivatives , thanks largely to the widespread acceptance of english law . 
  in the clearing world the euro is one currency among many , including the us dollar , japanese yen and the polish zloty . 
  yen , euro and sterling trades are cleared in the us . 
  deutsche b\u00f6rse 's eurex handles futures contracts for uk gilts and sterling . 
  governments all around the world are quite comfortable with the idea of having currency-denominated instruments traded and cleared outside their borders -- and with many investors using highly regulated london clearing houses . 
  to demand that only euro-denominated swaps can be cleared in the eurozone is fine , however such a standard would have to apply to everyone around the world . 
  that would not only create an anomaly , it would also indicate that europe may be bringing in a measure of protectionism -- which could well prompt a retreat from investors . 
  crucially , the euro is a global reserve currency and so can be traded and cleared anywhere , just as the dollar is . 
  a demand to have euro-denominated swaps only cleared in the eurozone would represent a step back from that . 
  it may also spur tension within europe . 
  the ecb clearing house policy of four years ago -- that london successfully countered -- was largely pushed by france , and many german representatives were privately at best lukewarm in their support . 
  one unknown is whether that raises issues about competition . 
  one could not also rule out american banks and exchanges ( especially the cme group ) setting out a legal challenge to a policy that tilts the playing field towards particular european corporations . 
  the cme , for one , has form in this area -- it took the cds market to antitrust authorities . 
  overall it 's hard to see this call for more euro-denominated clearing in the eurozone as anything other than another french effort to pull business back to paris . 
  it has tried to do so in the past and if it comes to pass , some business will move out of london . 
  rules are rules , after all , and the eu is likely to try to punish the uk in some way . 
  but in the end that might be counterproductive to a continent trying to stimulate economic growth . 
  much like the financial transactions tax , which started off with a great wave of enthusiasm until the details got in the way . 
  ultimately , markets do n't like being told where to go and what to do for political and not systemic risk reasons . 
  i 'm trying to find the article that covers third party coverage of passporting . 
  either way stripping the uk of passporting will only cause more issues for the eu , it wo n't help them , as stated above the uk financial sector in london is a worldwide centre , withdrawing passporting will be seen as protectionism and will cause issues with the eu economies . 
  for example the firms in questions can just be registered in any european country but still do business through london . 
  if they go out of their way to disrupt london , if they go out of their way to sabotage our trade negotiations with other countries , if they do other things outside their own interests then that is punishment . 
  on the free trade front they themselves have a vested interest keeping free trade flowing , so that 's up to them , but if they go outside their interests then that is punishment . 
  the only benefit we want from the eu is free trade , we wo n't want ever closer union , we do n't want the common agricultural policy , we do n't want the fishery policy , we do n't want free movement , we only want what we originally signed up for , free trade . 
  the only thing that we really want is something the rest of the eu really wants with the uk .

  which could be compensated by other routes such as trade deals with other countries , but the uk received less investment from the eu than most other eu countries anyway , the uk was a net contributor rather than receiver . 
  because they ca n't simply take the service sector , the city is an international financial sector , not just the eu , stripping it of the eu 's finances is hard because it 'll damage the eu 's exposure to the world 's financial sector , secondly it 's almost impossible to do so due to eu laws . 
  would n't get less money since the uk wo n't have to pay the majority of what it used to pay in the first place . 
  you ca n't compare a single customer with the uk and netflix with the eu they are not on the same scale . 
  it would be more like major production companies pulling their shows out of a contract with netflix so they can shop them to other service providers like amazon plus and then offering themselves back to netflix on a non exclusive contract . 
  because there 's absolutely no evidence to suggest it 's being removed , in fact there 's more evidence to suggest they 'll be keeping it since it already abides by the eu 's laws on third party pass porting , as reported by reuters and the ft. 
  it 's not about whose better than each other , it 's about a countries right to self governance , the uk only ever signed up to a free trade zone , it has since escalated to something more politically motivated and the uk public does n't really want that , they are fine with free trade but we like our own sovereignty , we always have , always will . 
  we 'd be happy to pay for trading without tariffs etc we just do n't want the open borders and other laws enforced on us . 
  because with said benefits also comes with handing over your countries right to govern itself which is to much . 
  whether the eu is a `` good club '' is a source of contention . 
  by totally stripping the uk of all benefits you 'll also be hurting the eu as well which is n't good , so what 's it going to be , cut your nose off to spite your face or cut your face off to spite your nose . 
  i think it 's basically because by doing so they are creating a self fulfilling prophecy . 
  it ca n't lose it 's financial services , there 's been several articles by the likes of reuters and the ft that have shown it 's pretty much impossible because it either violates eu law or it 'll severely damage the existing eu financial services excluding the uk . 
  article is a contradiction , he says the eu should n't punish the uk but then says they should n't do anything to make leaving the eu attractive to other countries who have thoughts of leaving , which basically means they should punish the uk for leaving .
