  ruled too much of the sub continent , unfair to choose . 
  / s i 'm not sure what you meant exactly tbh, 
  improvement depends on who you ask and when , different situation every week in every part of the country and tbh its been that way for the last half century . 
  i know that sounds obvious but the situation has truly been extremely different in every part of the country things were more predictable under saddam and more stable , that is if you ignore the fact that this ` stability and safety ' were built on the graves of millions others and the suffering of many millions more . 
  with his disposal the next few years became hell for everyone , then things got better for a years , then then then the chaos returned but less balanced ( worse in parts of the country ) and we have today . 
  i think there will be a sustained improvement starting withinnthe next decade as long as in and aroundbthe border things do n't fuck up again . 
  i guess i could say that instituions are less corrupt but there are still biases . 
  people living in the non direct conflict areas have a chance to make a living for once but it 's still far from perfect . 
  i think iraq would have become a parking lot if saddam was n't removed so there 's that . 
  wow that 's pretty insane . 
  my dad worked in yasuj as a foreign medic during the war in the mid 80s but quickly gtfo after realising the slightly higher pay was no longer worth it . 
  across the border towards the north in erbil it seemed like saddam was going to go berserk again ( 1996 ) so visiting back home was off limits , that 's when the uk became my home . 
  but yeah seriously fuck that guy . 
  what year was it do you remember , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  1 sovereign country , 4 nations , 4 countries ? 
  depends where they are, 
  what cars do eu officials drive anyway ? 
  i do n't think it 's a big enough priority that warrants ... a law . 
  i 'm assuming it 's a selection between audi , bmw and merc . 
  nonetheless , some reasons : - ** because they 're not ** safer than any other brand , period . 
  the rankings change each year as competition is fierce and everyone is close together at the top . 
  ` volvo safety ' is an age old mantra , not very relevant today outside of a few ` special features ' which either many collaborate on together or get competed with immediately . 
  - supposedly like officials of nations these eu officials too would be in armoured vehicles ? 
  if so then then high safety ratings for common road use is ** irrelevant ** as the manufacturers would beef up the vehicles individually to . . you know withstand bombs and gunfire . . let alone some minor collision . 
  - volvo 's ownership history for the last two decades has been foreign , first ford now a chinese company , it 's not necessarily a deal breaker but it 's like the us president using european or chinese owned cars for security , it just does n't play right and is obviously a ** potential security concern ** . 
  - let 's assume that the big three german luxury brands are the main providers - well it makes sense . 
  these guys have decades of ** experience ** of building this stuff for countries all over the world , in very large quantities ( biggest provides of specialist vehicles ) too so therefore output advantage etc etc. 
  volvo does too but nowhere near as on the same level , in fact volvo is almost the least experienced out of every single mainstream manufacturer ( except honda ) . 
  - with regards to the point made elsewhere , big engines is irrelevant as volvo makes big engines too + engines are shared along the whole organisation - for example vag owns vw , audi , skoda , bentley etc etc and the flagship cars for each of these brands will all use the biggest engines , so that 's not an issue . 
  same for bmw who 's 7 series armoured cars will share engines with rolls royce armoured cars . 
  too many close calls so i 'm gon na be difficult and do grouped regions-ish , close enough  north america : usa latin america & carribean : uruguay or brazil europe : netherlands or germany easternmost europe & central asia : turkey east asia & pacific : new zealand , malaysia south asia : no one in particular . . mena : lebanon sub-saharan africa : ghana, 
  sanctions are worthy , but also require europe to weather out the inevitable damage done to them too so it 's quite conflicting, 
  i 'm not sure where i 'd fit on some kind of scale probably centre hanging left where the only shifts i 've had over the years are part of a pendulum swinging slowly centre left-centre right . 
  firmly liberalism , social democracy , third way neoli . . yada yada i 'll take it all . 
  economically i 'll yo-yo with generalised anglo and nordic models and other things . 
  socially i 've always been liberal ( personal liberty yo ) but not necessarily ` approving ' , i 'm not even ashamed to admit that this website in particular has opened up my left eye on a few things so i 'm a hell of a lot more approving now , but i 'll never veer off the deep end with progressiveness . 
  all this is over several years and not limited to the last two , just seen that last part of your post now . 
  the rural areas ( anything from very secluded to small towns and farms etc ) are either solid middle class/upper middle class or deprived areas and a select few working occupation towns ( something like foxconn but ... not as ... fucked up ) . 
  some will have decent amenities nailed down and others will have the extent of basic necessities . 
  although you wo n't find specialist facilities of any kind and probably no proper shopping centres . 
  urban areas include everyone and everything in between . 
  life differs of course , i 'd say interests of the different places is the biggest observable defining factor as to what kind of place it is ( middle class town vs deprived town vs city ), 
  it 's difficult to get 28 different countries on the same page on very basic agendas , let alone something as complex as this . 
  well chances are you 've met many gay people and have n't realised it , that 's how it is everywhere, 
  nothing medieval about it xd , it 's a good practice . 
  it 's pretty normal for a university here too , tbh it should be the standard everywhere . 
  at high school you get maybe 3 attempts max , at college it 's around 2 , at university level there is no reason why you need to keep retaking exams . 
  in fact there is an opportunity to retake however your marks are capped at the lowest grade achievable regardless of how well you do in the resit . 
  a proper resit is for extenuating circumstances and there 's a whole in depth process - interviews follow ups at some places so there has to be a proper reason . 
  i 'd give it a 80-20 split in nationwide pride . 
  of course it 's for the soldiers not the mod . 
  about 50 % are actively proud of which 10 % are the rabid . . uh the ones the rest of europe generalises us with type . 
  about 30 % are proud but do n't really take interest at all . 
  the final 20 % are anti-militiary type - all sorts of folks etc. 
  there are days but other than rememberance and fundraising days theres no point, 
  its like asking where europeans would stand if there was a federal union with only two major parties ... well they 'd split themselves up between the two just like americans have . 
  some of the descriptions here are laughable . 
  - the democrats pitch a tent which stretches from the solid left to the solid right with a strong pillar in the middle . 
  - the republicans pitch their own which stretches from the centre-right to the far right with a strong pillar on the right . 
  this question would better phrased by asking a small number of people aka this sub specifically if they favour republicans or on what issues they are for republican than democrat etc. 
  liked and disliked is hard to say when you 're averaging the opinions of over 60 million people , for e.g. 
  muslims are the most disliked for many but i 'd bet you can find just as many people who like them too . 
  gypsy are probably an example of a group who have many dislikers but no ` likers ' and rather many ` meh ' . 
  split by era is useful , personally the vast majority of people who came ** before say 1985 ** were all examples of good assimilation , now apart from the obvious ( five eyes lads and irish ) : - for europe it includes north west and southern europe stretching to the ends of greece and some parts of the eastern bloc of which the majority were polish and many hungarians too . 
  - non european were commonwealth mainly ( everyone from indian subcontinent , africa and other small places ) . 
  - jamaican unlike other carribean groups were specifically difficult to integrate , other small issues with sikh and muslims for whom certain exclusions would be made but were overall part of the above good assimilation wave . 
  - notable group are the jews from wherever who were perfect assimilators . 
  from ** 1985 onwards ** immigrants of all shapes and sizes were on average less thrilling when it came to integration and assimilation ( do n't blame me , blame the average being dragged down i guess ) , now again apart from the obvious + above europeans mentioned : - better examples include the rest of europe , nigeria/south africa bloc , iraqi/iranian/turkish / kurdish bloc , sri lanka , southeast & east asia , central & south america . 
  - average examples include india ( now less efficient at assimilating , parallel enclaves have begun , but are better behaved citizens than before , looking within - christians better at this followed by hindus and a few notches behind are sikhs ) . 
  - special ` flip a coin ' 50/50 chance box includes pakistani , indian muslims , bangladeshi , mena , select west and east african nations . 
  exceptions for christian and jewish populations here and 3-4 countries in mena . 
  - worst integrated award goes to somalia and gypsy . 
  most disliked too . . maybe, 
  i 'm good friends with one person who 's rolling in # 200m at least directly inherited via a business , something along the lines of his dad + uncles coming here in the early 80s as part of the unskilled immigration wave . 
  most of the folks who came along worked the odd factory jobs , taxis or started small businesses . 
  these small businessmen ( basically corner shops and fast food ) could n't afford the price gouging for packaging by the big manufacturers so him and his brothers started their own , common language and culture ( + ethical pricing ) goes a long way for trust so soon enough they started supplying most sme 's across the region . 
  now they are the price gougers and pretty rich too , so it 's all ... worked out in the end i guess xd, 
  yeah public sector , bursaries up to # 30k and all, 
  there 's never enough public sector workers otherwise specific engineering strands in both private and public , generally managers or a pretty specialised position etc. 
  i know radiology related positions pay well here but no one ... even knows about them . . 
  definitely for everyone who has an opinion on syrian refugees , even those who ignore the effects of specific migrants will have to realise this . 
  however as pointed out elsewhere in the thread , the reputation of syrian refugees was already doomed before it even began for many europeans . 
  even people who did n't like obama ( other than strong headed ideologues/people who despise america/people who hated him for a very * specific * reason ) would still ** respect ** him for the person he is or acknowledge that he 's somewhat ** competent ** . 
  same goes for bush jr who is extremely unpopular among some people , yet we can all see that at the end of day he 's a ** mature adult ** . 
  and so on for the other 40 + us presidents . 
  the problem with trump is that he 's very immature and cringey , you can ignore all his policies and what he espouses but one good look at the way he acts and speaks and it 's quite embarrassing , it 's just too easy to satirize him . 
  i believe all sorts of crime rates increased with immigration from certain muslim countries , although if anyone is talking about it causally on the internet or in . . person ( ??? ), 
  in america then 9/10 times it 's quite exaggerated . 
  back and forth between engineering and logistics consulting , not the most fun but it pays well when i 'm not feeling lazy yourself ? 
  edinburgh , decent prospects to settle down and a pleasant place , provides a nicer balance to those not interested in london too, 
  there are significant cultural underhands which as a result of i will always have more in common with other people of this country no doubt . 
  this is something i have no control over . 
  on the other hand i choose to adopt certain lifestyle and social aspects and have certain fundamental political differences with those very same people , this is where my commonality with people of other big cities strengthens . 
  if i was to go small town then i would fit in in many ways but not completely without effort or desire , same goes for other international cities . 
  pretty sure a significant number of them moved over here as soon as it became easier , no crystal balls anymore just very well represented in crime and anti-social behaviour etc , i do n't despise them as most in this sub and / r/europe do but i do feel sorry for them , with the never ending cycle and all . 
  also the more traveller oriented type always have very flashy cars towing the caravans ... which is always a surprise, 
  fringe parties are always shite , bnp britain first and the long list of inbred-2 / 50th-constituency-strong parties on the far right . 
  plenty of crap on the far left too , promising a jumbo jet in every backyard sounds great and dismantling the uk from to top to bottom to share it 's wealth between the ex-colonies is certainly interesting but let 's ... take a deep breath first ... 
  lib dems , i 'll be a bit radical here and go ahead and approve of their views on brexit too , not so much the method to go about it perhaps . 
  they are pretty much the only functioning party in this country which resembles any form of liberalism .
