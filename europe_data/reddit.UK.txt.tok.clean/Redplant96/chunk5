  in fact their new leader was appointed a few hours ago and he 's a good lad apart from their usual shtick which i 'm on board with , what sets them apart from the other two relevant parties is two simple things - sound economic policy + political reform . 
  i 'm not hard to please , clearly . 
  - rural areas a slight distance away from a decent city , wherever they are . 
  - the numerous small towns all over the country that have n't had a penny invested in for decades , the deprivation is awful . 
  notable in the northern england , scotland and wales mainly . 
  - london , it 's by far one of the greatest cities on this planet and i 'll always visit and have lived there for a year or two many times but that 's as far as i 'll go , fuck the extortionate cost of living and especially the pollution . 
  seems about right, 
  this question is way too complex for this sub as well as experts tbh if i had to i 'd say ... zero sum or whatever , spicy memes  international crises . 
  house with so originally it was 69m ^ 2 , we got a bit carried away and extended it to just under 300 . 
  less space to grow stuff in the garden now but less of a hassle to keep the whole thing tidy too, 
   for europe ? 
  not the case , when adjusted for capita maybe , but nothing to write home about , now the iron curtian divide on the other hand . . well now you 've edited in per capita like i mentioned and you 're on the right track , but again as i wrote earlier there is nothing there , east-west divide clearly makes it look insignificant in comparison , check the map again . 
  the same conclusion is drawn for the hdi map ... 
  for europe ? 
  not the case , when adjusted for capita maybe , but nothing to write home about , now the iron curtian divide on the other hand . . for the world ? 
  well obviously life started in the south but it was too damn hot so many left and headed north , those that got the furthest found it was too cold but could n't retreat an inch because travelling 8000 miles by foot does a number on your body , so in order to survive they had to be more innovative . 
  but now with global warming on the way it should n't take long for wealth to equalise as no more cold edit : an / s needed in the ( ( current year ) ) ? 
  an incident could happen anywhere no doubt however you and your friend personally would be statistically safer to walk through every country in europe than every country in the mena region . 
  now of course certain incidents are more likely to occur in certain parts of europe to you or your friend , but nothing to stress over . 
  looks like it 's an easy choice between czechoslovakia and ddr , although whilst the stb were competent they were childs play compared to the stasi + the fact that any breakdown in thaw would make the ddr the foremost nuclear sandpit = czechoslovakia by a mile pls, 
  the big 4 are/were pretty equal and have more influence than smaller members , on the other hand smaller members have dissproportionate influence . 
  barefoot on carpets , slippers on wooden/tile etc floors , same for everyone else wherever i 've lived, 
  without any real reason then yeah it would come across a bit weird , but most people wo n't be fussed over it . 
  about a decade and a half ago it would have been a lot weirder , i think the high number of health campaigns over the years within the uk as well as what looks like an international convergence towards active fitness has lead to a very smooth and steady small decline . 
  wtf ... do you ? 
  above all it 's the us , then france then the rest of the five eyes . 
  that is if things were to get ` real ' . 
  now as for the other way around , in terms of absolute closest : - only with the us in this list is the relationship reciprocal - for canada it 's the us followed by the uk - for australia and nz it 's each other followed by the uk or us . 
  - for france it 's germany followed by the uk, 
  tbh you 'll find a bigger variety of american stereotypes in the uk than the rest of europe , from the most positive to the most negative and everything in between , probably because our cultures and history are more intertwined so we have a better idea than others . 
  on the other hand you guys almost universally have nicer and positive stereotypes of us and that should put britons to shame, 
  putting money on the balkans is always a good idea, 
  i would 've said alexander graham bell , classical scottish vs british argument ... 
  ... but of course the debate goes much beyond that with canadians and americans claiming him too , rightfully so , bit difficult to shoehorn him in this thread tbh, 
  your media in all it 's forms permeated europe and the rest of the world a long time ago , as a result we are up to date with a lot things going on in america ... so there is a lot of ammunition for us to shit on you with ( as people do ) . 
  generalisations is something everyone does , but again because your country is so popular it is easier to come up with generalisations etc. 
  due to all this we know about major and minor events in the us and can be critical of all of those things , whereas americans would most likely only know about major events in europe so there is less for you to criticise us about . 
  difficult to say but i 'd say 90 % + people do n't care , there are certainly minorities within every religion who do , ca n't say how much of a priority it is however . 
  - biggest minority would be classical christian conservative - middle aged & old white and black churchgoers etc. 
  - followed by some muslims who live in heavy-muslim-areas , in these types of areas they are good at representation and would likely vote for their own . 
  - then hindus , same circumstances as muslims . 
  - then sikhs - bit unique in this aspect as they only recently increased their political representation . 
  - now for jewish peoples , there are very few them but they will fiercely vote for those who they feel represent their rights regardless of religion . 
  there 's been an uptick perhaps in caring if a candidate is muslim ( negatively ) but it 's without any momentum, 
  there 's a few million muslims here ... i 'm not really sure how ` being happy ' can be measured polls on how they feel perhaps ? 
  there 's plenty on social attitudes among muslims where we see how they are on average more illiberal than the rest of the population , in spite of this they are content here , generally speaking : for example a c4 survey in 2016 finished with these questions http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/c4-survey-and-documentary-reveals-what-british-muslims-really-think  \u2022 a large majority of british muslims feel a strong sense of belonging to their local area ( 91 % ) . 
  this is higher than the national average ( 76 % )  \u2022 a large majority of british muslims feel a strong sense of belonging to britain ( 86 % ) . 
  this is higher than the national average ( 83 % )  \u2022 a large majority of british muslims feel that they are able to practice their religion freely in britain ( 94 % )  \u2022 british muslims are more likely than the rest of the population to feel that they can influence decisions affecting britain ( 33 % vs 21 % )  \u2022 british muslims are more likely than the rest of the population to feel that their local mp reflects their views ( 44 % vs 41 % )  \u2022 88 % of british muslims think that britain is a good place for muslims to live  \u2022 78 % of british muslims would like to integrate into british life on most things apart from islamic schooling and some laws now that last point pretty much puts to bed any debate about muslim integration in britain ( majority anyway ) , not directly relevant to your question but it 's a useful tidbit , the majority are willing to integrate ... but only to an extent . 
  when i was at university we had a regional competition between local universities - formula racing engineering and physics departments would design and assemble karts to compete , accountants were roped in to keep track of budgets so no one went crazy with intricate designs on cad etc. 
  marketing and business mgmt students helped in some way too . 
  last time i checked this thing has ballooned into an international event with all sorts of complications which probably use a bigger variety of students to help . 
  something like that might be too big of an effort but simple projects which need different skills is the aim right , then again this would n't apply/would be difficult to apply for some disciplines like social sciences and biology etc. 
  i pay it all in one instalment for all three together per year , about # 1,300 . 
  i have n't bothered switching in over a decade or so , so i can definitely get it cheaper else where by a couple hundred maybe . 
  german , danish and dutch . 
  ... no reason really other than i like the sound of them , they are pretty cool languages . 
  bonuses are they open up a whole new set of experiences i otherwise would n't achieve when visiting these countries . 
  - europe politically is not moving far right but far right attitudes are growing . 
  - no need to be concerned , although violence due to this may increase it is generally isolated . 
  the only concerns i 'd have going to europe are islamic terrorism but even that is limited to some of northern and western europe and is rare ( relative to to other crimes anyway ? 
  ) , spain is fine . 
  - if you 're planning to travel around europe then there are some countries where you will be looked down upon more due to your skin but those are far from spain , it is also not a huge issue because you will find that in many places around the world and parts of the us too . 
  in general the me is full of a lot of controversial conflicts . 
  modern arab culture is quite diverse ( from place to place ) although the heavy islamic influence is blatant . 
  in short the me region and the rest of the arab league are very backwards relative to europe . 
  the hot topic are muslims and they are incompatible as long as efforts from certain arab countries to influence them continues . 
  israel is the exception to the shithole that is the me and most of arab , however as much as israel 's butt is clean their hands on the other * hand * are certainly not . 
  now personally i 've spent quite a bit of time in the ` main ' countries so the rest of my answer is not representative of europeans at large and is ` cheating ' slightly :p - there are no correlations with how overall liberal or conservative each country is to any metric , certainly not wealth or literacy , it 's all over the damn place . 
  but as is everywhere else every big city has developed well in an extremely short amount of time and are all significantly less batshit than the rural areas . 
  in a handful of these cities a european/american can almost feel at home . 
  - i 've underestimated the amount of nom-muslims in the regions and how well many ( not all ) get on with muslims . 
  also surprisingly anti-israel sentiment can be common with non-muslim arabs too ... - religion plays a smaller factor than most people think in day to day life and politics . 
  - people on average are very hospitable , except the gulf states tbh ( even then oman , kuwait and select uae states are pretty chill ) . 
  arab tourists who come here are usually middle class or upper class , the former are just your standard tourists whereas the upper class come here to spend a shitton of money and race around the roads in sports cars however a handful are spoiled twats who think they own the people here . 
  - if i had to live anywhere in the arab world and the me then it would be in only israel , lebanon and tunisia . 
  but i 'd rather stay in europe . 
  emmv . 
  \\ + as for anything i love - beirut is by far one of the best cities in the world . 
  na just need to vpn the fuck up , not sure how long that will stay good for though . 
  over on / r/ukpol there 's plenty of folks who think anyone using vpns or accessing parts of the internet should be on a list ` just in case ' . 
  if that 's what many who have grown up on the internet feel like then i shudder to think about what the average person would do to these ` suspects ' . 
  its a two way street and if most are willing then it will happen , but the pushback will somehow be just as strong , i wo n't leave but i 'll stay for the popcorn , 
  i 'm extremely concerned about internet surveillance but it is going to be extended as much as possible . . year on year ... so i simply do n't pay attention to it anymore . 
  the wider public either agrees to it or is totally apathetic . 
  besides the 5 eyes and every single functioning intelligence agency with spare cash on this planet already has their eyes on yours and every other europeans internet activity anyway , if it 's not your own country then it 's someone else . 
  in the uk the only news we get by largest news orgs are about important domestic events or political/military . 
  there are plenty of ways to access day to day russian events but ... no one really cares ... 
  most people do n't mind taxes as long as they ... obviously provide something . 
  if more goodies can be provided for good value then higher taxes are fine , however if some people can get better value privately then they would prefer that ... or for some who this applies to might still want the higher taxes as they are staunch collectivists and that 's fine too . 
  emmv . 
  of course in parts of europe where corruption is preventing the proper delivery of some or even all public services then the public may not happy to be paying higher taxes , this does n't necessarily mean that the public is against higher taxation as a concept but rather that the existing situation has shown that they are not receiving value therefore until reforms are made they would be against it . 
  issues of efficiency are shoehorned in there somewhere too + propaganda everywhere ( for and against ) the situation is n't completely foreign to the us either and i 'd bet that a great proportion of americans would be willing to pay higher taxes too given assurances , but of course one of the two major parties operates on the basis of this concept so relative to europe support will never catch up . 
  this is probably the best list here . 
  i would n't mind staying here tbqh fam , otherwise ** first choices ** would be in order : 1 ) new zealand 2 ) us southwest 3 ) us northeast - 2 and 3 might switch places depending on what side of the bed i wake up on then ** second choices ** would be somewhere within mainland europe , in no order whatsoever : - netherlands ( + hobnob biscuit points for being painfully similar to the uk . . relatively anyway ) , - portugal - switzerland - austria - czechia any other country anywhere in the world i 'd love to visit but have no interest in settling down in , that will change as all sorts ofthings change of course otherwise these above will always be on a list . 
  some of these answers are pretty surprising , they 're thousands upon thousands of young europeans who come here ( and ireland too ) every year not knowing a lick of english and most others have anything from a low english skill level up to fluent and everything inbetween ... yet we would n't consider any of them dumb based on that . . just definitely foreign . 
  perhaphs this subreddit is overly dominated by the middle class and young who live in a bubble or so , super strongly doubt these answers would be replicated with the wider populations of continental europe tbqh . 
  in fact the modern world is very much an axis of the british and french and then as an extension of themselves american too , for all the good and bad . 
  from a big foot on each continent to the fattest fingers in every single discipline . 
  these great big bold courageously arrogant beautiful countri ... \\* runs and hides \\*, 
  the modern suit,
