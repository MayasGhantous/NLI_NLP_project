i think the fact 3/4 's were born in germany shows islam is incompatible with western values and they do not integrate into a country . 
  if the only benefit is likely to be to london `` financial services '' then , for the good of the uk as a whole , it should be avoided at all costs . 
  fuck london . 
  especially bankers , financiers etc. 
  one of my main peeves with america used to be the fact `` liberal '' is an insult over there . 
  how can being a `` liberal '' or `` left winger '' even be considered an insult ? 
  i used to wonder . 
  the last few months have shown me how . 
  i , for one , welcome our new germanic [ overlords ] ( http://i48.tinypic.com/2yn332w.jpg ) . 
  unfortunately not . 
  when she was pregnant she insisted on salty popcorn with nacho cheese on them . 
  my wife prefers mixing them and eating both at the same time . 
  not as awful as it sounds ... 
   but i hear and know stories , where people find comfort in a thought that there is some higher being , who watches over them , help them personal beliefs are one thing , organised religions are another . 
  if you want to believe in some children 's story just because you ca n't deal with loss that 's upto you . 
  when you start telling others what they should believe in and how they should believe in it then it 's bad . 
  organised religions are bad and the thought of them becoming meaningless in the west during my lifetime makes me happy . 
  ** if it 's from the guardian . 
   i myself do n't think that islam itself , as a religion is bad all religions are bad . 
  some are just worst than others .

   what could be the reason i wonder i only visit reddit for / r/europe . 
  i go to the bbc site to see what 's up in the uk then this sub to see what 's up in europe in general . 
  could n't care less about any other sub on this site . 
  they do n't interest me enough . 
  i agree , appointing either of those two would be a joke . 
  ca n't say i recognise any of the others so that probably counts in their favour . 
   when will you stop to decide , yes , this is ok when they get the answer they want , obviously . 
  democracy in action . 
   just go cnn and search for wales , only thing comes up is your football team . 
  turkey does n't even have that much . 
  not football , not rugby , the only time turkey is ever mentioned is when discussing what a third world shit hole it is . 
  a non european country like you is n't even worthy of discussing on this sub . 
  the [ race riots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_bradford_riots ) they had were almost 15 years ago now . 
  im sure it 's way better these days . 
   your gdp is lower even than ethiopia . 
  our gdp per capita is double yours . 
  even calling turkey a [ developed ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/oecd-countries-with-worst-quality-of-life-2013-5?ir=t ) country is an insult to the rest of us . 
  the only thing you seem to excel in is genocide and human rights abuse . 
   saying turkey is only relevant because of the refugees shows how clueless you are . 
  turkey is barely relevant even now * despite * the refugees . 
  no-one cares about you except when it negatively impacts europe . 
  even the poorest eastern block nation is more important on the world stage than turkey because at least they are in europe . 
  did n't say they had been leaving by the thousands for three years , just recently * and * considering germany is expected to have 1 million refugees alone this year 2 million would n't be that much of a stretch for the whole eu . 
   you are a puppet of england we at least have mp 's who represent us in parliament and are an eu country , unlike turkey . 
  unlike england we also have our own devolved national assembly . 
   you are irrelevant turkey is only relevant because not even refugees want to live there . 
  it could cease to exist and no-one would notice . 
  germany is lucky none have been killed in these arson attacks so far . 
  its only a matter of time though . 
  non eea immigrants are a [ drain ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11209234/immigration-from-outside-europe-cost-120-billion.html ) on british taxpayers . 
  immigrants from europe are a positive . 
  syrians would be the first kind , a drain . 
  lol yeah all these `` refugees '' are flying over . 
  could you be any more clueless . 
   awww , do n't have the arguments to address any other points ? 
  ive not seen you make a single coherent point yet . 
  see previous ridiculous attempt about airports . 
  lack of pepper and hard , undercooked carrots . 
  heresy . 
  i would imagine it 'd be families and children being cherry picked , [ like what we 're doing ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34268604 ) , actual people in need of refuge . 
  we get 600k immigrants a year anyway , not like we need to goto jordan to get a couple thousand skilled/unskilled workers from . 
  im sorry what ? 
  you 're going to * try * and disagree that thousands are leaving turkey for the eu every day ? 
  go on then , lets see it . 
   maybe i should point that nobody cares about wales ? 
  wales is actually part of a nation in the eu , a pretty powerful one at that . 
  turkey ... well , if anyone cared about turkey you would n't be having such funding problems now would you . 
   and anybody cares what turkey think about this ? 
  considering thousands are leaving turkey each day illegally to enter the eu and you do nothing to stop them ? 
  no , i do n't care what you think , only what we can convince your government to accept . 
  they should also register asylum seekers and prevent them from violating the national borders of neighbouring countries , but they do n't . 
   turkey spends 6bln per year well this link says about [ $ 8 billion ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turkey-syrian-refugees_55fbd728e4b08820d9183073 ) so far and this link from last year says about [ $ 4.5 billion ] ( http://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/turkey-spends-45-billion-on-syrian-refugees/104908 ) at that point . 
  so really this year germany is spending $ 7 billion caring for 800k whereas turkey is spending about $ 3.5 billion caring for 2.2 million . 
  why would he be joking ? 
  6 billion over 4 years would be chump change to a country like turkey . 
  the difference is so far every plan goes `` you accept quotas then we 'll do `` x '' later '' . 
  what they should have done is said `` lets stop them coming first then we can discuss what needs to be done , if anything , at home '' . 
   turkey only spent 6 billion germany is spending that much just providing for the asylum seekers they 're getting this year . 
  still think we have a ways to go until we reach the obvious and sensible compromise though . 
  the ridiculous quota idea is n't dead and dusted yet . 
  build a big new refugee camp on the coast of turkey , send all those caught trying to cross the med there . 
  toss billions at turkey/lebanon on the condition europe sends them asylum seekers to be processed there . 
  europe can cherry pick x amount of genuine refugees to take in , turkey etc will have the funding to deal with the crisis and migrants will be less inclined to drown in the med . 
  anyone remember when cracked used to write interesting articles about science , history , video games etc ? 
  i miss those days . 
  not been on the site for over a year now , it 's dead to me . 
  this is the demographics of those claiming asylum in the eu . 
  [ 70 % are men ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_male_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu-28,_by_age_group_and_status_of_minors,_2014_%28%25%29_yb15_iii.png ) . 
  [ lots of separatist groups apparently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_europe ) . 
  other than catalonia and scotland none appear to be serious though . 
  so far . 
   the eea and ultimately the eu is literally the last thing any country actually wants . 
  actually allowing it would be the last thing any country wants . 
  who wants to set a precedent for their own regions to suddenly declare independence ? 
  luckily they wo n't need to actually veto it because spain will . 
  so they can offer neutral comments on the situation but if one of their regions decided to become autonomous you can bet they 'd be opposing it . 
  i would argue that in the event of a federal europe catalonia declaring independence is an empty nationalistic gesture and if it does n't become a federation then its in spains national interest to hinder catalonia every chance it gets . 
  im sorry , which humanities course are you studying in university again ?
