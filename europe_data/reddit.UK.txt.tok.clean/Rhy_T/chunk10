  assuming a dictionary of 80k words , when the english language apparently has over [ 1 million ] ( http://www.languagemonitor.com/number-of-words/number-of-words-in-the-english-language-1008879/ ) total words and ignoring the fact french is just vulgar latin anyway . 
  even if it was as you claim , that would mean it would be more true to say 58 % of english has latin roots . 
  29 % is not a majority and its based on rather strange criteria if you ask me . 
   nearly 30 % of english words ( in an 80,000 word dictionary ) may be of french origin . 
  80k dictionary ? 
  may be ? 
  oed has double that number of entires . 
   portugal is doing more to help refugees than your silly country within a country ever will no , no it is n't . 
  [ in 2014 ] ( http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2015-06-19/refugees-in-wales-the-facts/ ) wales had [ 8.1 % ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/cardiff-proves-popular-asylum-seekers-7730501 ) of the uk 's asylum seekers while wales makes up 4 % of the population . 
  the 1.9 k asylum seekers we had living here in 2014 is 40 years worth for portugal . 
   the uk has 6 times more people than portugal and its economy is 10 times bigger than portugal 's , making it the 10th biggest economy in the world , whereas portugal is 53rd . 
  maybe you should be taking in 10 % of the refugees the uk does then instead of one 300th . 
  it means the claim the majority of english words are french is stupid . 
  i assumed your original comment was tongue in cheek humour , turns out you 're just an idiot . 
  i would debate the `` majority '' part , as we borrow words from all over and the majority of english words are english . 
  there 's also the ridiculous idea of the nobility speaking french for a while having much impact on the peasant masses . 
  come to think of it the `` same culture '' bit is pretty outlandish as well . 
  the fact you managed to compress so much garbage into so few words is truly impressive . 
   and why are great britain and ireland ` not put into a region ' we veto 'd it . 
  you ca n't lump us in with france , we wo n't have it !, 
  it is in the media and on this sub . 
  tends to be followed by the word `` racist '' or `` fascist '' . 
  unmanned drone , middle of the night , small charge . 
  or id just wait until he was loading up , have my ships ready , block his leaving/tow them back . 
   i took your comment about rescuing as enabling to mean there should be no more rescuing , which would by default would mean lots of drowning . 
  i see , so you read a lot of shit into it that was n't actually said or even implied . 
   also i do n't think you 're going to have much luck blowing up every vessel docked in north africa yeah im sure the fucking libyan coast is going to be too much for the combined forces of the eu to police . 
  international sea trading powerhouse that it is . 
  or maybe we could take them to refugee camps or turn them the fuck around , or use drones to blow up anything vaguely seaworthy before its crammed with immigrants . 
  pretty much anything except what we 're currently doing . 
   if you 're in favor of letting them drown in the med point out to me the part where i said or implied that . 
   hundreds of people are feared dead after two boats carrying up to 500 migrants capsized off the ** libyan city ** of zuwara they did n't even get off the fucking libyan coats before running into difficulty ? 
  this is what happens when you enable the smugglers by picking everybody up and taking them to italy . 
  they have every reason to keep on shoving as many people into anything vaguely seaworthy as they can . 
   we usually take 60 a year and here we are getting called right wing and xenophobic for only taking in 30k, 
  do n't strain yourself portugal . 
  considering the armed forces of those countries these days my money would still be on britain . 
  three of them are basically non combatants .

  if it 's so small its not worth considering it ca n't really be used as an argument for immigration now can it . 
  politicians unlike say , footballers or businessmen , are representatives of the people and the character and morals of such a person is in the public 's interest . 
  the fact that they hide their ** adultery ** shows they know it will effect public perception of them and rightly so . 
   in some western countries most people will cheat on someone at some point . 
  i do n't want `` most people '' as a politician , i want someone smarter and more upstanding in government than `` most people '' . 
  even in america the effect immigrants have on the gdp is negligible overall . 
  in the uk immigration as a whole has next to [ zero effect ] ( http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefingpaper/document/235 ) and immigrants from outside eea areas are rather drain . 
   [ dustmann and fratini ( 2013 ) estimated the fiscal impact of eea and non-eea migrants during the 1995-2011 period . 
  their results suggest that during this period the total fiscal impact of eea migrants in the uk was close to gbp + 8.8 billion per year ( an average of close to gbp + 0.6 billion per year ) . 
  the total fiscal impact of non-eea migrants for this period was estimated at gbp -104 ( an average of close to gbp -6.5 billion per year ) ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/fiscal-impact-immigration-uk ) having 10k eastern europeans come to britain would probably be a tiny benefit to the economy . 
  having 10k middle-east/african/asian would be a drain . 
   i disagree with this we 'll agree to disagree then . 
  i do n't believe in this mythical professional/personal lives split . 
  honest and loyal people will be honest and loyal in both . 
  cheaters will cheat when it suits them in both . 
  in fairness to the police its hard to spot the difference between nazi 's and far [ leftists ] ( http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/485075634-left-wing-sympathizers-clash-with-police-as-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=x7wjla88cweo9hktrlanxid71boxhoaaz20%2b3%2fzn%2bolbrdi5movqj2bxhbi%2fze2tirnofsyc4n0ihupoaetola%3d%3d ) sometimes .

   yeah , i 'm all for the idea , and the bbc could definitely benefit from a greater direct viewership . 
  how ? 
  bbc does n't use adverts so its not like there will be an increase in revenue , just costs . 
  normally i would n't . 
  but there does seem to be a large amount of politicians getting caught up in this and , unlike a celebrity , being a dishonest cheater is something that should affect their career . 
  they 've been complaining of brigading for weeks . 
  there 's not a sub or website on the net that could brigade a 400k user sub 24/7 for several weeks . 
  looking at `` new '' submissions it almost all seems to be news . 
  boring news nobody is interested in . 
  `` a plane and tombstones were discovered ? 
  catalan citizenship ? 
  serbia and kosovo ? '', 
  unless you live there who 's going to care . 
  it 's not like the sub is bursting with quality content like what word spain uses for pineapple . 
  the only recent `` series '' has been `` so , you want to visit x '' which i find to be incredibly boring . 
  oh so now you 're going to quibble about tense ? 
  i never stated germany had already received 800k this year , i did n't even state they would get 800k this year . 
  i used 800k as an example , to show the amount of likely rejections , because its what your government predicts it will get this year . 
  [ bamf.de asylum seekers prediction for 2015 , 800k . 
  ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/meldungen/de/2015/20150819-bm-zur-asylprognose.html )  the federal ministry of the interior and the federal office for migration and refugees expect that this year up to 800,000 asylum seekers are coming to germany . 
  im sure you could have found that if you wanted . 
  feel free to bookmark it . 
  with the rise in attacks on immigrants and right wing extremism they 'll need it . 
  personally id rather have an increase in neither . 
   german interior minister thomas de maiziere said on tuesday that far more asylum seekers would arrive in germany this year than the 400,000 first-time applicants his ministry had previously expected . 
   he said the interior ministry was preparing a new forecast that would soon be published , adding : `` i have to prepare the german public for the number ( of asylum seekers ) being considerably higher than we estimated so far . '', 
  funny if you look at [ reuters ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/18/uk-europe-migrants-germany-idukkcn0qn15u20150818?feedtype=rss&amp;feedname=worldnews ) , [ financial times ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1099e22c-467e-11e5-b3b2-1672f710807b.html ) , [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33992563 ) . 
  pretty much every website out there is claiming 800k as an official german government estimate . 
  you link me some page with no english translation that talks about some stuff that happened upto july . 
  proves nothing . 
   it means that instead of being taken to detention centres , illegal migrants will be processed through the courts before being taken to jail . 
  good , those `` detention centres '' are practically voluntary . 
  keep them detained in jail then deport them , give them no chance to disappear again . 
   the way they treat this refugees avalanche is shameful [ bit rich ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states,_by_age_distribution,_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) coming from portugal .

  i do n't care how bad the war is ( [ not that you country being at war automatically makes you a refugee ] ( http://www.geneva-academy.ch/rulac/international_refugee_law.php ) ) people from the eritrea , pakistan , gambia , mali are not our problem . 
  if they were refugees they should have fled to a safe neighbouring country , not travelled half the world .
