   simply share the work load to correctly process the asylum seekers that should have been done , in greece and italy . 
  letting them roam free around europe has led to nobody wanting to take extra costs/claimants on , not to mention the number of illegals who have made it in . 
   right wingers we are speak for yourself . 
  i like to think i belong to the non stupid left . 
  im all for immigration , benefits , strong nhs , the eu etc. 
  but upto a point . 
  just because i support those policies does n't mean im up for some benefit scrounger with 12 kids being given a mansion or having 6 figure asylum applicants a year and talk of quotas . 
  `` illegals '' maybe not . 
  but the majority who apply for asylum get [ rejected ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) and , of course , there 's the matter of the illegals who do n't even claim asylum . 
  out of germanys 800k `` asylum seekers '' about 500k will not be valid refugees plus however many tens/hundreds of thousands who entered germany but made no claim . 
  reminiscent of the greece crisis . 
  * obvious long term solutions ( bankruptcy or debt forgiveness ) * germany benefits from keeping the status quo . 
  * greece ends up with continued austerity , rest of europe has to pay for it . 
  * everyone gets fucked except germany , who benefit . 
   you have proven my point the only proven thing is that you spend half the day commenting on and reading every thread regarding immigration and the other half complaining that there are so many threads about it . 
  considering how much someone who `` hates the topic '' wants to discuss it , i would say less than half a dozen threads on the front-page at any one time is hardly that unwarranted . 
   that is not how it works . 
  uuuh yes , yes it is actually . 
  hence the bit where we , you know , refused to join the euro and refused migrants quotas and europe could do nothing . 
   the sense of entitlement with this one is through the roof . 
  we 're not some european superstate yet . 
  countries are still sovereign and able to decide things for themselves . 
   you you tell them they will have to stay in romania , many would never start to migrate at all . 
  good . 
   france has no idea what to do with people who do n't want to stay in france but want to go to uk . 
  if they 're in france but not claiming asylum they are illegal immigrants . 
  detain them and return them to country of origin , its what countries do with illegal immigrants . 
   we secretly hope that uk and central/eastern europe start to implement the `` obvious and easy solution that solves the refugee crisis once and for all '' . 
  they are , did n't you notice ? 
  the plan is `` let them all go to germany '' . 
  we 'll decide what we want to do ourselves just like you decided your own course on immigration and the euro for yourselves . 
  and if we decide to stay , not join the euro and not accept any quotas on asylum seekers you can shut up and like it . 
  2014 - 200k asylum claims [ the biggest threat to europe 's top economy is not foreign competition but its low birth rate . 
  it must open its borders to more immigrants , skilled and unskilled ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20131126/germany-needs-more-immigration ) 2015 - 800k + claims [ germany sees biggest baby batch in a decade . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20150821/germany-sees-biggest-boom-of-births-in-decade ) germany wanted this . 
  you wanted more immigration and refused to talk about keeping them out of europe . 
  now you can deal with it . 
  edit : save your time beercannon i blocked you when you could n't prove any claims and resorted to childish insults . 
  considering what a broken record you are be assured i will not be viewing any of your comments , no loss . 
  if all you have to offer is the euro and hundreds of thousands of immigrants you can keep them . 
  syrian rebel leader [ apparently ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/syrian-rebel-leader-seeks-europe-fleeing-govt-jihadis-163636165.html ) . 
   this is a perfect example , read the ops comments , he is obviously pushing an agenda here . 
  i mean it is not even a new article & the information has been posted here before . 
  it 's not racist , it 's not even particularly about immigration and people obviously thought it was worth discussing , hence the comments and votes . 
  but obviously because you have some vague feeling of an `` agenda '' it should be deleted . 
  corbyn could literally shit out pure gold and it wo n't make a difference . 
  he has zero chance of being prime minister . 
   does anyone happen to know if he said word one about reducing the influx as opposed to simply absorbing anyone who shows up ? 
  you 're just being silly now . 
  wrong to invade , wrong to remove dictators , wrong to bomb and , when we turn a blind eye and ignore problems in african/middle east countries , we 're wrong then as well . 
  sometimes i do n't know why we even try . 
   how do you know that this is going to get worse and worse and worse is the wave of immigrants showing any signs of slowing down ? 
  are right wing parties resurgent across europe ? 
  it 's not like syria and libya have been massively more unstable in the last year , yet numbers arriving keep on breaking records . 
   and what exactly do you mean with the left comprimising there 's only been one plan so far , share the burden around , not actually stop them getting into and moving around mainland europe with complete freedom . 
  when the left is actually willing to consider a plan that does n't simply involve countries taking xx thousand more asylum seekers maybe we 'll see a workable solution . 
   i just dont think megathread is a solution it was pretty obvious it was unworkable and it was tantamount to censorship . 
  id be really interested to know what mods , if any , were still pushing for the megathread idea after it being up for a week . 
   why do n't you go and actually look at their application ? 
  having seen them posting on here constantly for the last week i do n't have too . 
  calm , dispassionate or even `` discussion '' are not words that can be applied to them . 
  i look forward to seeing you unveil a bunch of new mods who are undoubtedly in here calling for the return of the megathread and complaining about rampant racism in the sub . 
  im sure it 's going to do wonders for the discussion . 
  im sure they 'll have no agenda whatsoever . 
   ( i hope you 'll be one of them ) i do n't . 
  barring an actual neo-nazi he seems like he 's the last type of person who should be a mod . 
  scratch that , an actual nazi would be better . 
  they would at least be open about their agenda and not pretend to have the moral high ground . 
  i can see the application list to be mods in my mind now : hjongoldrake , thebeercannon , senseiswag ... 
   the only country that that does nothing to help refugees is great britain . 
  [ non eu asylum applicants 2014  ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states,_by_age_distribution,_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) germany - 202k sweden - 81k italy - 64k france - 64k hungary - 42k * uk - 31k * austria - 28k netherlands - 24k denmark - 14k only 5 countries out of 28 had more asylum applications last year and one , italy , is a main entry point . 
  germany 's and sweden 's figures are their own fault , it 's what they wanted . 
   you have no fucking idea what you 're doing . 
  none of your plans make sense , and none of them are feasible . 
  thanks for the laugh . 
  every `` plan '' so far had been `` take them in and share the burden '' proposed by some bleeding heart such as yourself . 
  you know what plan has n't worked and is n't going to work ? 
  that 's right , other countries sharing them around . 
  germany and sweden are close to cracking wo n't be long before the rhetoric changes from `` lets have quotas '' to `` maybe we should stop them arriving '' and `` where else can we put them in the meantime ''  living in washington ? 
  i 'll be crushed . 
  i bet secretly you 'll be crushed europe is n't living up to some ignorant progressive fantasy you have of us . 
   i do n't see the connection . 
  eurosceptics clutching at straws . 
  leaving the eu wo n't help reduce illegal immigration by any significant amount , but it might scare some dullards into voting `` no '' . 
  annoyingly , like the av referendum , it might end up working . 
   the french will likely kick the brits out of calais , forcing them to deal with the situation on their own soil but then * they * would n't be on our soil either and maybe a couple thousand illegal immigrants end up on a train back to calais . 
  it goes both ways . 
  all the polls have shown those wanting to leave the eu are at a pretty constant minority . 
  still , being all talk and no trousers , the left is doing a sterling job in reviving right wing sentiments all across europe . 
  if britain does vote to leave it 'll be the failure of the left rather than a win by the right . 
   if it 's so easy why is n't the uk doing this ? 
  process , deport , repeat . 
  because its a long hard process , costs a lot of money and those who do n't have valid claims tend to be quite sneaky when it comes to deporting them and not play by the rules . 
  in britain we [ apparently ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/03/illegal-immigrants-face-eviction-without-court-order-under-plans-to-discourage-migrants ) needed a court order to * evict illegal immigrants * from a property . 
  and when a suspected illegal is caught or is being processed by the courts they are n't necessarily detained , so `` not turning up and just vanishing '' is a popular option . 
  the border control agency lacks the funds and resources to properly deal with the issue and that 's because bleeding heart liberals `` feel '' locking up suspected illegals until their claim is processed is some violation of basic human rights . 
  they 'll shit their collective pants if you suggest some kind of `` camp '' . 
  a quota system is not going to happen and even a voluntary scheme , like that last time , will be but a drop in the ocean . 
  the only solution is to stop them getting into europe in such numbers . 
  germany is already waking upto the fact it ca n't handle the amount of claimants and no-one else is willing to just take them off their hands .
