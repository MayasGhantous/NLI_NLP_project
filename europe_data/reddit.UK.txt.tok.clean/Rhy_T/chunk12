   truly only a civilized nation would do this civilised nations have borders and control them by checking who has a right to come in , detaining and removing those who do n't . 
  obviously these concepts are too hard to understand for far left loons . 
   walk me through this . 
  how does the very general page you linked me to prove this ? 
  what claim are you making here ? 
  it says it right on the page and even gives linked sources to the data it used . 
  are you simple or something ? 
   cool . 
  are you going to negotiate with is on the handover , or just let them off on the desert without water ? 
  regardless there are still areas not under isis control . 
  just because your country is at war or you might get blown up by a suicide bomber does n't make a refugee . 
  if they we 're legitimately concerned about their lives they would have sought refuge in turkey . 
  you know , follow the international rules for claiming asylum . 
   that does n't follow . 
  what if turkey just does it to piss you off ? 
  it does n't follow that because these `` refugees '' do n't want to be in turkey , and turkey does n't want them , europe is somehow stuck with them . 
  how disappointed are you going to be when this stupid quota idea fails again btw ? 
   and ? 
  even with a huge number of syrians about 60-70 % of refugee claims turn out not to be valid . 
  thats just those that apply , doubtless there are many more thousands in europe atm and not making any claim . 
  then what ? 
  then they are obviously economic migrants and not refugees fleeing persecution so should be sent back to the country of origin . 
  yes , even if that 's syria . 
  if they decline to provide proof of country of origin they should be detained until they do . 
  in absolute numbers , a total of almost 104 thousand persons were granted refugee status in the eu-28 in 2014 , 626 thousand applied . 
   in which case , again , where are you going to send them back ? 
  turkey . 
  the safe country they passed through on the way to the eu . 
   islamic state territory so that they can be tortured , beheaded and executed if that was the case [ a lot more of them ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) would be accepted as refugees . 
  they are , in the most part , economic and illegal migrants . 
  the amount actually fleeing persecution would be easily manageable by the whole eu . 
  solution : bigger camps , faster processing , quicker deportations . 
  countries accepting a `` quota '' while millions more are lining up to make the journey is not gon na happen . 
  i just find it amusing that a mexican who 's never left mexico , with a history of saying stupid things about europe and getting down voted for it , can come here and complain about the place not being `` an accurate representation of europeans ' mentality '' and when i provide , what i think are sensible sources , to show that that it probably * is * i get down voted for it . 
   national papers might be difficult to get in mexico , where he comes from . 
  he loves talking about spain in particular and he says `` edit : it 's ok to downvote .

  send them all to germany . 
  europe is happy , germany gets to be progressive it 's win win . 
   after all , sjws and pro-immigration people are craaaaaazy and do n't exist in the real world anyway im sure they exist but , like in this sub now , they 're a substantial minority . 
  it was always going to happen as the [ sub got larger .

  they can be neighbours with [ johnny depp ] ( http://www.msn.com/en-au/entertainment/celebrity/johnny-depp-buys-greek-island/ar-aad5mg2 ) then . 
  enjoyed both . 
  the thought of the person who wrote that ever having a position of power or authority worries me more than migrants or fascism . 
  the national language issue is a bit funny in wales . 
  nationalism and the national language do n't always go hand in hand . 
  despite repeated attempts to revive it ( it was mandatory in school for me until 16 and even non welsh language schools have a heavy focus on it these days ) only about 15 % of people can read and write in it . 
  i suspect the main problem will be the immigrants who made the journey to greece are not interested in staying in a refugee camp until whatever conflict in their country is resolved . 
  if they were turkey would have been an easier option . 
  im all for building these camps though and holding claimants there until their asylum claim is worked out . 
   on 15 july 2008 the eu council of ministers [ approved a new ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/about_us/office_in_wales/welsh_language_en.htm ) status for the use of welsh as a `` co-official '' language within eu institutions . 
  this agreement , at the request of the uk government , related to the use of welsh in the council and paved the way for further negotiations on the use of welsh in other eu institutions , such as the european commission or the eu 's committee of regions . 
  im as proud as the next welshman , but i think this is stupid . 
  skilled migrants ? 
  any . 
  unskilled ? 
  none . 
  refugees ? 
  any where my country would be the first safe one they enter . 
  good idea , it 'll save money , wo n't happen . 
  i actually had some idiot try and argue with me in messages `` they have no muslims and need no mosques '' was a * racist * comment . 
  when he complained that i cherry picked one out of his half a dozen `` proofs '' i chose another one . 
  that turned out not to be racist either . 
  at that point he told me to go fuck myself . 
  this person is in this thread multiple times complaining about the `` racism '' all over the sub but , when push comes to shove , 90 % of the time its not racism , just rather intolerant . 
  i * did * see a rather racist comment yesterday calling immigrants animals and saying they belonged in a zoo . 
  i reported it , as did several probably , and it was removed by mods . 
  undoubtedly there are a number of people pushing a right wing agenda and , if you suspect someone might be racist but the comment in question is n't , you should debate or discuss the point . 
  screaming `` racist '' at every thing that does n't meet some vague standard of tolerance does more harm than good . 
  im quite desensitised to seeing the word `` racist '' , it has lost all meaning to me . 
   free movement of people inside the eu will not be up for negotiation , mark my words as long as those people are n't illegal immigrants , good . 
   if that 's your definition of a country then it applies to all the examples you previously dismissed . 
  my definition of a [ country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/country ) is the definition of a country . 
   although not sovereign states , england , scotland , wales and northern ireland are referred to as separate countries , which collectively form the sovereign state known as the united kingdom tell me , can you see catalonia or bavaria on this [ list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states ) ? 
  in fact show me a credible source that calls bavaria or catalonia a country . 
   and it does not grant you any special status internationally that those other regions do not have . 
  we get to have fifa and uefa recognised national football teams . 
  regions like catalonia , sicily and bavaria do n't . 
  if they win outright that would be a clear mandate from the greek people to reject austerity . 
  the imf/eu/ecb would have to respect that !, 
  id love it if a new `` anti austerity '' party appeared and won by a landslide . 
   allow me to be blunt allow me to be equally blunt . 
  we 're absolute definitions of countries , not regions . 
  just because we do n't go around bombing civilians and shooting ourselves in the foot for so called `` independence '' does not mean we 're less of a country than ireland is . 
  scotland and wales have devolved governments , a legislature , our own law making abilities on a large amount of topics and , unlike ireland , we 're united . 
  when ireland is united under one government you can trash talk about great irish status as a country . 
  pretty spurious claim actually , the alleged increase in intolerance is much smaller in 2013 than the fall between 2011 . 
  despite a spike during the financial crisis it shows a clear downward trend . 
   right-wing terrorism is a non-issue , clearly in germany perhaps , it 's not an issue in the uk . 
  which is the country under discussion . 
   and who is doing that again ? 
  do you not recognise your own quote ? 
  the only difference is i changed it to reflect the actual evidence . 
   it does and racism itself has increased a lot in the past 5 years .
