  about [ 70 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) of asylum seekers are found to not be valid refugees and that 's just the ones that apply . 
  the true figure is probably much higher . 
  it 's really getting quite pathetic though that people are trying to paint economic migrants as `` refugees '' and crap like that , it 's really sad . 
   yea they are , especially the ones burning down buildings with people in and attacking and murdering people too . 
      and the ones who go to an island dressed as a police officer and killing a load of people too . 
  ca n't speak for your own country but that is n't a problem in britain . 
  the first minister is [ carwyn jones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_government ) of labour and the last election was 2011 . 
  another one is due next year .

  you 're a broken record . 
  you should just leave already because i do n't think this place will ever become the leftist hugbox you wish for it . 
   nobody is calling you a racist , get out of that victim role are you even self aware ? 
  almost half your posts are you simply shouting `` this sub is racist !, 
  waaagh why am i getting downvoted ? '', 
   ad hominem its an attack on a posters character as opposed to a counter argument . 
  like you did with your comment comparing my post to that of a racist without actually offering any argument or discussion . 
   and where exactly did i call you comment racist ? 
  * seems to be the new `` i 'm not racist but [ *** insert racist belief ** * here ] . 
  * that bit . 
  the bit where you directly compared what i said to that of a racist . 
  remind me again what part of my comment was racist ? 
  that 's right , none of it . 
  [ people who disagree with me = racists ] the first , last and only argument of every leftist when it comes to immigration . 
  you , and people like you , are the reason right wing nationalist parties are on the rise across europe . 
  im pretty central , probably centre left . 
  but im against mass immigration from non eu countries and illegal immigrants in general . 
  so , despite my views matching most of the public 's , im apparently a racist now . 
   france probably does n't want the british army to be deployed on their soil according to a yougov poll a majority [ ( 54 % ) ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/08/09/calais-crisis-french-and-british-support-sending-a/ ) of french people are in favour of the british army being deployed there to deal with the migrants , with 27 % opposing the idea . 
  surprised me as well . 
  from the bbc . 
   proud of its own identity and language , catalonia is one of * spain 's * richest and most highly industrialised * regions * wikipedia . 
   catalonia ( / k\u00e6t\u0259\u02c8lo\u028ani\u0259 / ; catalan : catalunya ; occitan : catalonha ; spanish : catalu\u00f1a ) [ n 1 ] is an * autonomous community of spain * nowhere claims catalonia is a country , because it is n't one . 
  4 out of 25 and one involving muslims in general . 
  there were that many threads about russia on the front page yesterday . 
  in fact there are 4 threads about russia on the front page right now as i respond . 
  yes , it is . 
  2 seconds on google would show that . 
  catalonia is n't a country . 
   and the basque country is very different from castille . 
  bavaria is very different from north-rhine westphalia . 
  piedmont is very different from sicily none of those are countries . 
  if they were then maybe they should be included . 
  because almost every one of those people pass through at least one safe country to get here . 
  undoubtedly some syrians are entitled to be refugees , but not all of them and not those who pass though several safe countries in search of a better standard of living right on the western edge of europe . 
  most refugees are housed third world countries , because third world areas are where you tend to get genocides or ethnic cleansing these days . 
  no matter how bad it is in * eritrea * they have zero right to claim asylum in europe unless they happen to travel here by plane . 
  mass refugees should be an issue for neighbouring countries , not countries thousands of miles away . 
   to comment on your edit from above : so do i. 
  now what ? 
  i wager if you were to post that in a thread about calais you would get upvoted as a lot of people would agree with it . 
  then someone would accuse you and everyone who voted for you of being right wing fascists brigading the sub . 
  they would take their inevitable downvoting as proof . 
  personally im not in favour or against the idea of the army being sent there , but im flabbergasted 54 % of french respondents voted to have british soldiers on french soil . 
  in theory . 
  we all know that 's how it does get used though . 
  complaining about it is one thing , saying everyone who down votes `` x unpopular opinion '' is racist though is another . 
   i 'll stop using generalizations ... 
  carry on using them . 
  but quit crying about `` racists brigading '' when you get down voted because your generalization is less popular than another . 
  the reason anti immigration posts get upvoted is because most polls show [ a lot of people ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-concern ) want a reduction . 
  the reason why `` we should accept them and give them free hugs '' comments gets down voted is because most people disagree with them . 
  ** edit ** to highlight how far removed your opinion is from most people , [ 67 % of british people and * 54 % of french * ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/08/09/calais-crisis-french-and-british-support-sending-a/ ) want to see the * british army * deployed to calais to help deal with the issue . 
  wales is apparently [ 14.3 % ] ( http://www.forestry.gov.uk/newsrele.nsf/webpressreleases/5213e24e7a6aa2c2802578500040d449 ) and scotland [ 17.8 % ] ( http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/nfi_scotland_woodland_area_stats_2010_final.pdf/$file/nfi_scotland_woodland_area_stats_2010_final.pdf ) . 
  shame these infographics always treat the uk as one entity . 
  tends to be quite a large difference between individual countries on most things , which is always interesting to see . 
   you people nice generalization there pal . 
  let me guess , you think i have right wing political views ? 
  wrong . 
  maybe you should try posting something constructive instead of just complaining everyone who down votes worthless comments , like yours , are closet racists . 
  constructive comment . 
  informative and well sourced . 
  im sure the inevitable down votes you receive will be from racists though . 
  the quota idea was for `` asylum seekers '' not refugees . 
  the vast majority of asylum seekers turn out not to have valid refugee claims . 
  which is the trouble . 
  ive no doubt europe could manage to find space for say , 100k refugees , its the fact that among that 100k asylum seekers would be 70k with no claim who would have to be processed and removed by whatever country they end up in . 
  slovakia has no border with these entry points , is not a destination for them so if they 're willing to take any in it 's entirely up to them . 
  countries should n't discriminate against an immigrant because of his level of education . 
  they do though . 
  if we 're talking genuine refugee 's who have a valid , proven claim , then not accepting them based on religion is pretty shady . 
  if we 're just talking migrants , or even asylum seekers , then slovakia is well within its rights to impose conditions it feels will be beneficial . 
  allegedly in the uk something like 30 % of food farmers produce never even make it to supermarkets . 
  perfectly good food gets ploughed back into the ground for not meeting exacting appearance standards . 
  if they were serious about tackling waste they would start with farmers/producers and actually provide money or help the charities distribute the food . 
  food waste is not just a french issue , but this stupid `` law '' would have been . 
  [ hulk ] ( http://www.incrediblehulkonline.com/strengthfeats.html ) does . 
  yeah , better to do something both the charities and the supermarkets do n't want just so a bunch of social media activists can feel good and pretend they 've done something . 
  a lot of food is still going to be wasted , a large percentage never even makes it to the supermarket because it looks wrong and the charities do n't have the capacity to take in all the food from just the supermarket . 
  it will solve nothing . 
   usually the asylum request is denied no surprise . 
  refugees are meant to be fleeing persecution e.g torture , imprisonment or death based on their ethnicity , religion or beliefs . 
  think holocaust , genocide or ethnic cleansing . 
  these people should be fleeing , quite literally , for their lives . 
  if its safe enough to leave your wife/kids behind while you traipse across several countries then you are n't a genuine refugee . 
  immigration was barely mentioned in the run up to the election except by ukip . 
  who as it turns out were big , huge , winners in terms of increase vote share . 
  the tories looked particularly stupid when 5 years ago they were complaining about immigration being in the hundreds of thousands and since then it 's more than doubled .
