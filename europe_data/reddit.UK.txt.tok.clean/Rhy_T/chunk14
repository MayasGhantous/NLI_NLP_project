  the three main parties plans consisted of `` trust us we totally got an idea , but we wo n't make any promises we can be held to '', 
   this is just pure good sense if its such a good idea how come both charities they asked are concerned it might become a poisoned chalice and state they do n't have enough funds or people to manage and distribute that amount of food . 
  seems like typical leftist thinking to me . 
  nice idea in theory , falls apart when you try and apply it real world and the pesky problem of paying for it arises . 
  we had an election recently and the party manifesto 's went something like this . 
  ukip - kick them all out greens - do away with borders altogether labour/tories/lib-dems - immigrants ? 
  what immigrants ? 
  do n't you keep a significant amount of them in refugee camps though ? 
  try suggesting such a thing should be done in europe ... 
  it [ clearly states ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:final_decisions_on_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applications,_2014_%28number,_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iv.png ) germany received 44,335 non eu applications for asylum and rejected 37,349 of them . 
  the source data also shows that the total number of refugees accepted was 6k that 50 % was a fist review figure where half applicants were * immediately * discarded . 
  84 % of non eu applicants ended up getting rejected in germany . 
  it also shows the uk rejected about 68.5 % of claims . 
  it also clearly states that across the eu 626 thousand asylum applications were received in 2014 and a `` total 104 thousand persons were granted refugee status in the eu-28 in 2014 '', 
  someone posted a link about germany in another thread saying it was at about 70 % . 
  the uk rejects about [ 60-70 % ] ( http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/assets/0002/7887/asylum_statistics_may_2013.pdf ) of claims and that figure seems consistent . 
  i added an extra 10 % because not everyone makes an asylum claim do they . 
  i was probably being really generous , looking across at france they have thousands in a camp at calais , not making any claim , as well as however many just disappear into the black economy . 
  i would wager the true figure for genuine refugees is closer to 10 % than 30 . 
  ** edit ** even though he hoped it would prove the opposite someone kindly provided me a link for germany showing [ over 80 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:final_decisions_on_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applications,_2014_%28number,_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iv.png ) of non eu applications for asylum were rejected in 2014 . 
   by that logic , the only way for a guy from syria to be legally recognized a refugee in , say , germany , is to get there direcly by plane from damaskus . 
  probably why germany , like the uk , ends up rejecting about 70 % of refugee claims . 
  that 's those who claim asylum mind you , it does n't include the large amount who do n't even try to claim e.g the thousands at calais the trouble is arising because the vast majority of those coming over are not genuine refugees . 
  processing them is costly and removing them once it has been determined they have no valid claim is very hard to do . 
  so nobody wants them , so nobody does anything . 
  im all for genuine refugees being distributed across europe , share the load as it were , but i do n't see why the uk should take in say 100k alleged `` asylum seekers '' if it turns out 80 % of them are not refugees . 
  refugee status has criteria people must meet and abide by . 
  he would be an economic migrant the second he leaves safe turkey for a better standard of living and , if caught on the border , should be turned away . 
  considering we 've sent over miles of high security [ fencing ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29098641 ) , [ ( twice ) ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33833536 ) , to calais and we 've given [ millions of pounds ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11110967/uk-will-give-12m-to-calais-in-a-bid-to-stop-hundreds-of-migrants-reaching-britain.html ) and sent over [ security staff ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/03/uk-funds-100-extra-channel-tunnel-guards-as-migrant-standoff-continues ) it 's a bit rich of you to try and blame britain . 
  maybe france should actually start trying to deal with the situation instead of blaming britain while secretly hoping all the migrants make it over here . 
  a lot of times i hear about health and safety gone mad it turns out to be false . 
  like that [ forcing kids to wear goggles to play conkers ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1223537/pupils-ordered-wear-goggles-play-conkers-school-nanny-state-ruling.html ) . 
  it happened , but not because of a specific ruling just some overzealous idiot trying to enforce stupid things . 
  one of the things i am thankful for though is the maximum working week . 
  if it was n't for that i would have been in huge trouble when i was unemployed . 
  in the uk only about 30 % of [ claims ] ( http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/assets/0002/7887/asylum_statistics_may_2013.pdf ) are valid . 
  of course that 's just those who make claims , not the illegals who disappear into the black economy . 
  and of course once it 's not like we can keep them all locked up ... so they very rarely end up getting deported . 
  been there once . 
  could n't pay me to go back . 
  it has been a huge issue in france and the uk and , unlike germany , they have been pretty consistent in their approach to the matter . 
  willing to help the immigrants and the countries they arrive in but that help does n't extend to having tens/hundreds of thousands of them arrive in the country . 
  germany has been quite happy to push for everyone else to take in more immigrants however and have prided themselves on the number of asylum seekers they take in . 
  now it appears they 've changed their tune . 
  are you seriously saying such a subjective thing as `` too many '' should be an automatic ban ? 
  and that 's your major complaint that will cause you to leave the sub looking for a hugbox elsewhere ? 
  i think its far better for a bit of leeway . 
  id rather some racist guy simply gets away warning , followed by a ban if they continue , than some innocent user to get a ban . 
  the [ civilized manner ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/7230274/immigrants-to-be-taught-how-to-queue.html ) . 
  people who post racist and offensive things will , and have always , got banned . 
  the mods have stated what constitutes `` agenda pushing '' , you allegedly agree with them , yet you still do n't think agenda pushing will be stopped . 
  what are you on about when you complain about agenda pushing and racism ? 
  you seem to have this idea that because people post some things you might not agree with they must be racist and should be banned somehow . 
  i think you 're the one pushing a very clear agenda . 
  if frequently submitting articles and links on one subject is not enough for you how would you define `` agenda pushing '' ? 
  good to see but im not sure recruiting a `` substantial '' amount of new mods will mean much unless it 's combined with certain current mods losing their positions . 
  the sheer stupidity of the megathread , amount of trigger happy deletions/shadowbans and incompetence to let the situation drag on for several weeks should prove that certain people are n't fit to be moderators . 
   based on what i 'm reading in this thread , it seems most people here do n't accept this . 
  ive not seen anyone claim that genuine refugees should be refused the right to stay in a country . 
   i do n't think that `` half of africa '' would be entitled to receive refugee status , for the simple fact that only a little part of the applicants actually get it i do n't think the vast , overwhelming majority , of those coming into europe will be entitled to refugee status for the simple fact they are n't [ refugees ] ( http://www.geneva-academy.ch/rulac/international_refugee_law.php ) . 
  as i mentioned someone `` fleeing from a war that started mostly for geopolitical reasons '' is not a refugee . 
  if we start taking in everyone fleeing from war or famine we 'd end up with half of africa having a valid refugee claim . 
  imo genuine refugees , who abide by the refugee system , should be allowed to live in the eu . 
  `` displaced persons '' merely fleeing war should be given safe accommodation , but * not * freedom to travel around europe and illegal/economic immigrants should be deported . 
  if that syrian doctor faces death or torture at home , flees and claims asylum in the first safe country he enters . 
  he 's welcome to stay there as a refugee . 
  if he travels through several safe countries without claiming asylum he is not a refugee but an illegal immigrant . 
  illegal immigrants should be deported . 
  just because your country is at war , suffering drought , famine or anything else does not give you a right to pay human traffickers thousands of pounds and travel across several countries to have a better life in europe . 
  by your `` logic '' [ half of africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts ) should be allowed to move to the eu just because there 's conflict in their countries . 
   christer fuglesang never heard of him . 
  the first `` x '' into space was so 50 years ago . 
   and why should we in any way revive it no-one 's saying you should revive it , just not be ashamed of it . 
   i 'd argue that our culture is as `` rich '' as our ancestors ' what culture ? 
  not trolling , explain to me what swedish `` culture '' is today and why it 's something a country should be proud of . 
  what about the romans ? 
  mass slavery , cruel punishments and executions ? 
  what about the hundreds of thousands who died in wars for their `` empire '' ? 
  you 're seriously trying to claim occasional raiding was somehow bad compared to what most cultures did both before and after the vikings ? 
  it 's not like the viking went around displacing or genociding native populations . 
   how the fuck is being a viking some sort of admirable ideal ? 
  because they were the best sailors around for centuries , had settlements from iceland to the mediterranean , discovered america , had a rich culture , were excellent traders and capable fighters . 
  they used to matter . 
  other than the occasional raiding and pillaging what did they do that was so bad ? 
  libya is 97 % [ berber and arab ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_libya ) . 
  syria likewise has a tiny ethnic black population . 
  the vast , overwhelming majority of these * economic migrants * are not from either warzone . 
  if france was willing to take responsibility and do something about the illegal immigrants in it 's country maybe we could talk about moving the border to calais . 
  until then britain should beef up security over there . 
  are you implying [ this boatload of young working age men ] ( http://gazettereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/migrants-rescued.jpg ) might not be poor refugees fleeing from war in [ libya ] ( http://pomed.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/libya1.jpg ) ? 
  i do n't lie to myself and pretend i really care about bangladeshi or congo poor , so no . 
  i do n't think eastern or central europeans are greedy for expecting to have a minimum european standard of living . 
   jeremy corbyn has been addressing increasingly sizeable audiences across the country , enthusing young new voters and labour veterans alike with his * anti-austerity , leftwing message * declaring that the current economic and political status quo is neither inevitable nor desirable . 
  it 's a shame the last election the voters clearly went for the whole `` right wing and austerity '' approach . 
   the daily telegraph even openly encouraging their readers to sign up as labour supporters to vote him in as leader , in the expectation that his leadership would lead the party to electoral doom or even to the demise of the party . 
  if corbyn gets in as leader labour should be more worried about being overtaken by ukip in the next election than beating the tories . 
  and im saying that as someone who has voted labour the last three elections . 
   crime is connected to social status , age and income . 
  not to religion or nationality i would say culture you were raised in and religious beliefs would have a much bigger effect than `` age '' or `` social status '' . 
  crippling poverty might be a huge incentive for crime , being middle class is n't .
