   if i look at the german crime statistics , romanians and poles seem to be way more criminal than those evil criminal turks . 
  so by your logic then the reason for that must be because polish and romanian immigrants in germany must be significantly poorer or younger than turkish ones , something i doubt would be backed up by facts . 
   eu law = / = international law any more than us laws = / = international laws . 
  correct and dmca is not an international law yet it gets imposed internationally . 
  so the whole `` no one country should have the authority to control what content someone in a second country can access '' statement is pure hypocrisy . 
  america can and does , it 's just other countries that are not allowed to . 
  just feel the need to point out im not actually in favour of the right to be forgotten law . 
  even though im massively against illegal immigration and think the legal rate is way too high ... 
  i do n't think its fair to single out a specific case like that . 
  a study that states `` x crime rate is higher among x immigrant group '' is something worth discussing . 
  but a one off crime , no matter how bad , should not be included in the discussion . 
  what 's that ? 
  per day ? 
   but he 's certainly not pulling this `` out of his ass '' . 
  you notice how both * figs * and all the data used for his `` hypothetical simulations '' come from his own `` working paper '' . 
  the `` working paper '' being year 1 university tier stuff made entirely of hypothetical 's and simulations in the first place . 
  it 's stuff pulled out of his ass based on stuff he pulled out of his ass . 
  pure garbage . 
  your average tumblr infographic is more reliable and better sourced . 
  neither of those claim any such thing , they have zero information at all from pre-assembly days and it even says the drop in the rankings is partly due to the increase in countries joining the study . 
  all it says with any certainty is that wales is falling behind compared to england and scotland . 
  which , as i stated , is hardly a recent or even surprising thing . 
  use the same reports the other one used for `` evidence '' [ dustmann , c and t frattini ( 2013 ) the fiscal effects of immigration to the uk '' ] ( http://www.cream-migration.org/publ_uploads/cdp_22_13.pdf )  we find that between 1995 and 2011 , immigrants from eea countries made a net fiscal contribution of about 8.8 billion gbp ( in 2011 equivalence ) , compared with an overall negative net fiscal contribution of 604.5 billion gbp by natives . 
   thus , between 1995 and 2011 , eea immigrants contributed to the fiscal system 4 % more than they received in transfers an d benefits , whereas natives ' payments into the system were just 93 % of what they received . 
  our estimates also show that ** immigrants from non-eea countries have made a negative fiscal contribution overall ** , when considering all years between 1995 and 2011 . 
  in the conclusion they spin it to not include 1995-1999 data , but even then a 2.9 billion `` contribution '' over 11 years is borderline meaningless . 
  could very well still be a loss given margins for error . 
  there 's the guardian or mail `` putting a different spin on the same information '' bias and the `` some random nobody pulling stuff out of his ass and pretending its valid '' kind of bias . 
  this `` model '' is the latter kind . 
  might as well link to a study done by stormfront . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  highly biased , completely hypothetical with assumptions all over the place . 
  it was also posted a year ago . 
  no surprise you missed it , you must have searched quite hard to find that garbage . 
  if you read the report ( i was interested in the metrics used to judge peacefulness ) it states [ that things like ] ( http://static.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/global%20peace%20index%20report%202015_0.pdf ) :  of the indicators that deteriorated , four were internal : the likelihood of violent demonstrations , political instability , impact of terrorism and level of violent crime . 
   conversely , three of the indicators with the largest improvement were external : political terror scale , military expenditure as a percentage of gdp and nuclear and heavy weapons capabilities . 
  it would seem that things are actually getting less peaceful in europe , but that is being more than offset by cuts to military spending and a lack of external wars . 
  would be interesting to know what percentage of these so called `` asylum seekers '' are accepted as genuine refugees . 
  its very unprecedented . 
  the previous massive influx of refugees were european and you 're deliberately ignoring germany is expected to take in between 400-600k this year . 
  a leap of 3x of that of last year and a new record . 
  with no end of the immigrant ** crisis ** in sight and germans already fire-bombing immigrant housing at ever increasing levels and holding anti islam marches ... claiming this situation has precedent is ridiculous . 
   why would n't i ? 
  because if you happen to be of the opinion the `` immigration crisis '' is not a big problem that graph would have the opposite effect than it is currently intended to have now . 
  i wonder if it was 6 months later and it included the figures for 2015 would you have posted it then . 
  i suspect whoever posted it on twitter would n't have , it would n't suit their obvious agenda . 
  so what your saying is the current crisis is comparable in terms of impact on germany 's population that the reunification had ? 
   since coming to power in in 1998 , their only claim to fame is that they managed to screw up the education of a generation that had the misfortune to go through the welsh education system when these idiots called the shots . 
  because wales had such a world renowned education system in the 80 's and 90 's amirite ? 
  sounds like someone got a 140 result on his facebook iq test ... 
  heard of a number of so called child geniuses coming through over the years . 
  could n't tell you their names though , other than getting a degree at a young age ive never heard of any of them achieving anything . 
  edit ** like this [ american girl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/promethea_pythaitha ) who had an alleged 173 iq . 
  guy who wrote that should visit wales . 
  im not sure about them buggers from the nearest village , do n't even get me started on those weirdo 's from the next valley over . 
  i had n't , but i just did . 
  i 'm quite sure you 're just trolling at this point . 
  give me a credible way greece can get its hands on say , 200 billion , that does not involve that money coming from other european countries and i might give you an upvote . 
   the eib has hundreds of billions of capital it has hundreds of billions already invested to get more would mean everyone else giving money in . 
  a lot of money , probably hundreds of billions more and investing wo n't see a return for a long time . 
   a very good track record of sensible investment . 
  eib has invested about 10 billion in greece and says that 's pretty much it . 
  it only see 's weak [ investments around ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/167597/article/ekathimerini/business/eu-investment-bank-sees-no-new-projects-in-greece ) . 
  your pipe dream of them investing 100 billion into greece is just that , a childish dream . 
   greece is far from the only suffering state . 
  maybe if everyone else in the eu was flush with cash investing in greece might be viable , even then it would be hard work for a politician to sign upto it . 
  we ar n't though and it is n't viable . 
  you have yet to offer a credible alternative for austerity that does not involve everyone else giving away tens , or hundreds of billions , to greece via the eib or direct . 
  until someone does i think everyone should quit knocking the germans or the `` ebil trokia '' because it makes them look like spoilt children . 
  the only money in the eib is what member states put in , it has nowhere near the hundreds of billions needed . 
  there were complaints over how long it took to scrape together < 10 billion to invest in greece . 
  if it does n't get paid back or loses money the rest of europe loses out . 
  your `` plan '' is still having the rest of europe spend , and take the risks , on greece investing its way out of austerity . 
   the eib is big enough to lead a ez-wide investment recovery program . 
  it 's not even big enough to bailout greece on its own , gets it 's money from other european nations , has it 's own rules who it can lend too ( it 's a bank duh ) and still requires repayment ( see the part about it being a bank duh ) . 
  do you have any ideas other than magicking money out of thin air ? 
  or that does n't require everyone else giving greece hundreds of billions ? 
   poland for example . 
  [ except ] ( http://blogs.channel4.com/paul-mason-blog/greece-spain-radical-alternative-party-podemos-law-justice/3731 ) for [ the ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/05/uk-poland-gdp-szczurek-idukbrea140g720140205 ) part [ where ] ( http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id-moe/09289.pdf ) they [ went ] ( https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/09/23/pola-s23.html ) through austerity you mean ? 
   the solution must come from europe . 
  the europe where everyone is going through austerity you mean ? 
  sovereign nations , who 've been making cuts for years , should give money to greece so they can spend their way out ? 
   austerian lunacy dominates in other places as well . 
  show me a european country ** not ** going through austerity . 
  show me the ones that choose to borrow more to invest instead of making cuts . 
  some , like spain and ireland , did invest small amounts in stimulus . 
  a fraction of what they cut , but they still went through austerity . 
  too many idiots around thinking austerity in greece is some kind of choice . 
  it 's not . 
  they ca n't borrow money and they are in the red . 
  their choice is super fast austerity via bankruptcy or a slower measured austerity via bailouts . 
  it 's disappointing to see the so called liberals constantly attacking germany in this manner and dragging up the world wars at every opportunity . 
  showing their true colours . 
  your examples still do n't show this has anything to do with brigading . 
  even that gamergate nonsense , which was mainly limited to mean tweets , barely limped on over a month and there was constant threads evident about it on 4chan . 
  everyone knew what was going on , hell there were threads all over the internet calling both sides to arms . 
  the chance this place is being secretly brigaded for over a month by stormfront , 4chan or some other subreddit is virtually nil . 
  i do n't doubt there are a few people determined to troll and make it their mission to peddle propaganda . 
  but i do n't believe its a large scale coordinated thing , nor to i believe it 's limited to right-wingers doing it . 
  constant baseless accusations of brigading are , imo , just an excuse for trying to shut down the discussion because people ca n't accept this sub does n't agree with them on every topic anymore .
