  this sub has doubled in subscribers this year and , compared to a year ago , [ there 's 8x ] ( http://redditmetrics.com/r/europe ) as many people on at any one time . 
  as you concede , immigration is going to be a large issue for most of those new users and , if their make-up reflect the general public 's , the majority are going to be against illegal immigrants and/or in favour of reducing immigration . 
   go back on my account page before the megathreads happened and you will see a very different picture . 
  i did , you make several references to brigading , stormfront or nazis . 
  tunisia attack thread , a thread about sweden and almost every thread on immigration for the this week . 
  you 've and those other you 've mentioned , been screaming brigading !, 
  [ for over a month now ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/polymute/comments/?count=475&amp;after=t1_csked6k ) , when are you going to concede that maybe [ immigration might just be the biggest issue in europe ] ( https://euobserver.com/news/129815 ) and that a heck of a lot of people [ want less of it ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/12/chapter-3-most-support-limiting-immigration/ ) . 
  how long will it take ? 
  another week ? 
  another month ? 
   do you want to take a trip down into the rabbit hole ? 
  thats it ? 
  that 's your `` proof '' a sub of 400k users is being brigaded ? 
  there are 800 people on right now and i bet theres a few extreme right wing and left wing nutjobs among them . 
  does n't mean its being brigaded . 
  absolutly zero evidence whatsoever of brigading , yet you throw the word around constantly . 
  seriously , almost every page of your comments seems to mention stormfront and brigading . 
  after lurking here for a while i was moved to finally register during the greek crisis . 
  there seemed to be a huge disconnect in the reality on here and i felt the need to have my say on the matter . 
  the overwhelming majority at the time seemed to be posting that sryzia were the poor victims , that a deal would be sorted out soon and the evil troika would get their comeuppance . 
  i disagreed . 
  whenever they were challenged these people usually resorted to calling the place a right wing circle jerk and accusations of being brigaded flew around . 
  now the topic is immigration and i bet its the same people calling everyone nazi 's and talking of brigading . 
  just how long is this `` brigading '' going to last do you think ? 
  maybe people against ** illegal ** immigrants are n't neo nazis . 
  i know its crazy , but they might actually be centre or left wingers . 
  maybe this place is n't being brigaded . 
  maybe immigration is one of the biggest issues in europe , has been for a long time and will continue to be for a long time . 
  brigading ... as if stormfront or a certain chan has the attention span to brigade a sub all day every day for weeks . 
  im no expert but usually when these places take action it 's very obvious and gruesome . 
  the uk has helped . 
  that help does not extend to taking in immigrant quotas from other eu countries . 
  censoring country specific versions of google is still complying with censorship . 
  especially when they make it the default portal . 
  also if such censorship is american , like a dmca take down . 
  then it is very happy to enforce american censorship on the whole world . 
  so yes , google has a history of aiding governments censor results and in censoring information all over the world based on one country 's laws . 
  the country demanding worldwide censorship just has to be america for it to be carried out . 
   google operates worldwide and ca n't be expected to censor their results globally just to please 1 group of countries . 
  they did for years in china . 
  the guardian is going full at it today but judging by the comments even their readers wo n't swallow this level of tripe .

  that 's not much use to the rest of the uk if all business , industry and transport investment is geared towards se england . 
   [ at 70 , west wales and the valleys was poorer than parts of bulgaria , romania and poland , and than the whole of the czech republic ( 80 ) , slovenia ( 84 ) and slovakia ( 84 ) -- all countries that were part of the east european communist bloc that collapsed more than 20 years ago .

  do n't see it happening , they tend to be quite loathe to be sent back and do unsporting things like not having any documents proving country of origin . 
  still , just because you ca n't prove where they come from does n't mean they should be given a free pass to vanish into the country at will . 
   85 % of all the refugees in the world were n't hosted by the developing countries well durrrr . 
  a refugee is someone who flee 's immediate persecution/harm based on ethnicity etc. 
  they then get to claim asylum in the first country they enter where they will be safe from persecution . 
  so of course the vast majority will have claimed asylum in the developing world . 
  people who cross several countries to get to the eu ** are not refugees ** . 
  they are illegal immigrants . 
  they 've given up pretending it 's not censorship . 
  i would guess the eastern countries came across tea via the silk road whereas the portuguese went to the supplier direct .

  story was posted in here 9 hours ago . 
  i found it an interesting read . 
  but you know , this mega thread exists to censor stories relating to immigration so i understand if you missed it . 
  maybe in a day or two the mods will include it in a link in the immigration megathread part iv . 
  as fond as i am of the dragon idea ( and i am ) the [ gurkha 's ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11772155/send-army-to-halt-calais-crisis-police-chief-says.html ) might prove more effective . 
  they have to stop using the word refugee and immigrant interchangeable . 
  i do n't know anyone against genuine refugees claiming asylum . 
  economic and illegal immigrants on the other hand have no rights to live in europe . 
  it 'll end when the mods get bored or immigration is no longer one of the big few issues facing europe . 
  my money is on the mods getting bored . 
  shame they are nowhere near as on top when it comes to updating the mega thread . 
  i enjoyed that article . 
  was a good read . 
  shame hardly anyone will get to read it because of this dead megathread . 
  but that 's the plan i guess . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_refugee_population ) germany accepts by far more refugees than anyone else with france then accepting about half as much and britain about a quarter of what germany does . 
  from what ive read most eastern european countries are quite set against receiving immigrants . 
  id probably view them in the [ same light ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syyl0gfndre ) . 
  still at least we can have an open and honest debate of the issue . 
  otherwise we might end up with hotheads calling for stuff like sending the [ army over ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11772155/send-army-to-halt-calais-crisis-police-chief-says.html ) . 
  or building camps for them on another countries land * and * sending the army over . 
   [ conservative mp david davies echoed calls for the army to be sent to calais and and urged the government to build camps in the countries migrants were from so they could be `` sent back in a kind and humane fashion '' .
