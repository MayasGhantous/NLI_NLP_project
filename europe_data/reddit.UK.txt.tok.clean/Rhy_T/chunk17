  merlin said so . 
  unless google is lying to me that 's already your [ battle flag ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?btng=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=french+battle+flag&amp;gws_rd=cr,ssl&amp;ei=as-4vbsenmgquamlhoaj ) . 
  i would n't change it . 
  we have a dragon , dragons are cool . 
  would you change from a dragon ? 
  the [ skynews ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1524949/faith-school-bans-pupils-from-meeting-outsiders ) source listed in that article would have been a much better thread . 
  would have been nice if they could have provided a copy of the alleged letter as well . 
  well dresden , with a similar population to helsinki , had around 17k for an anti [ islamisation ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2884224/record-number-germanys-anti-immigrant-rally.html ) rally . 
  considering those at dresden had to fight off allegations of being `` nazi 's '' and you can understand why people are loathe to protest about it in public . 
  [ pretty ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/12/17/perilous-politics-immigration/ ) much [ every ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-31800374 ) poll [ on ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-concern ) the [ matter ] ( http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefingpaper/document/249 ) has [ consistently ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/majority-germans-reject-immigration-outside-eu-312282 ) shown [ the ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/jan/08/french-public-opinion-charlie-hebdo-attacks ) majority [ are ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/12/chapter-3-most-support-limiting-immigration/ ) against [ immigration ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/14/in-europe-sentiment-against-immigrants-minorities-runs-high/ ) though . 
  im sure you can guess the country that breaks this trend , it 's a meme . 
  and that 's immigration , i bet even more would be opposed if you started talking about what should be done with illegal immigrants . 
  15k is hardly proof that they do n't . 
  pretty small percentage of both the city and finland as a whole . 
   they did , and that caused their economy to shrink with 30 % and necessitated them to ask for even more credit . 
  the economy started going tits up the second it looked like syrzia might get in power and reached terminal velocity during the week leading upto the referendum . 
  to try and claim it was trokia , or accepting the new demands , that caused the deepening of greece 's financial crisis is ridiculous . 
   now you blame them for accepting the demands of the trojka ?!, 
  you 're not even trying to be coherent , just spitting bile at greece it seems . 
  i blame them for spending 5 months unsettling the markets , not collecting taxes and brining greece to the brink of ruin before doing what anyone with half a brain would have done in january . 
  at the end their choices were even worst than they started with . 
  if they 'd had the balls they could have refused , defaulted and left the euro , if they 'd had brains they might have won some small concessions . 
  they had neither unfortunately . 
   yeah , fuck politicians who consult their population before taking an important decision , right ? 
  important decision ? 
  what was that then ? 
  the vote was n't on a final agreement , the bailout had expired . 
  they were warned that even if they voted to accept it there would need to be extra measures put in place because of defaulting on the imf and how bad greece 's economy would do in the meantime . 
  the referendum was a giant joke , it meant jack shit no matter the outcome . 
  all it did was make the situation worst . 
  besides the pointlessness of it sryzia are an anti austerity party . 
  their only mandate , given not 5 months ago , was to end austerity . 
  they did n't , they increased it . 
   nobody is trying to understand why what is happening is happening greeks voted in an anti austerity bunch of populist idiots then voted to reject a non final bailout offer , on a bailout that was expired , after a warning that delays in reaching a deal would require further austerity cuts . 
  now your economy is worst off that it would have been , with harsher demands than would have been . 
  what `` reasons '' or `` logic '' passed through the minds of a greek voters as they made those votes is irrelevant , although would doubtless cause me much amusement to read . 
   going to implement the obvious solution . 
  the obvious solution was agreeing to the demands or defaulting and leaving the euro . 
  you voted in amateurs who took your economy to new lows , before deciding to accept even harsher demands anyway . 
  lets not also forget the hilarious idiocy of the `` oxi '' vote either . 
  twice in half a year greek voters have had a say . 
  they chose the stupidest path both times . 
  it comes from the differences in the jobs men and women do . 
  women have on average lower paid jobs , they still get paid the same as their male counterparts . 
  it is illegal to discriminate pay based on sex and a woman who gets paid less than a man , who does the same job and has done as long as a man , would easily win a case against the company if they paid her less . 
  personally i think `` cruelty '' is a massive exaggeration and secondly i was pointing out that several , in fact every one i looked at , of those claims are actually in their manifesto . 
  they do plan to change inheritance tax so it 's based on the receiver , they do plan to import levies on imports based on their carbon footprint and they plan to `` save '' 5.5 billion from the prison budget over the course of 5 years , when it only has a budget of about 3 billion to start with . 
  well everything i looked at , from banning rabbit hutches to scrapping sats and giving fans the legal right to buyout a lcub is in their manifesto . 
  and to claim it is properly funded is a bad joke . 
  the only thing the green party serves is the self righteous tits who make it up . 
   i mean it usually helps the gdp of the country and provides diversity to the country . 
  legal migrants probably do , but even then [ it 's minimal ] ( http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/pdfs/bp1_16.pdf ) . 
   ** conclusion ** 20 all three methods recently employed in the uk are approximate but they all point in the same direction - namely , that the benefit of large scale immigration in terms of gdp per head is minimal . 
  indeed , all major overseas studies of large-scale immigration involving mixed levels of skills , such as we have in the uk , find that its net effect is very small in comparison to gdp, 
  if only we had a party focussed on green issues . 
  sadly we only have the bad joke that is the [ green party ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/01/welcome-to-the-bonkers-world-of-the-green-party-manifesto/ ) . 
  in wales what surprised me most was the fact we constantly get [ aid ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-29827221 ) from the eu for being so [ goddamn poor ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33080593 ) . 
   then there 's the fact that my employer can not make me work stupidly long hours , oh how the tories hate that one . 
  they could force so many more people off jobseekers if they could n't refuse 50 , 60 , 70 hour a week jobs . 
  timing is everything . 
  admiring hitler or doing a nazi salute < 1939 , not really an issue . 
  doing it  1945 , big issue . 
   with record high temperatures . 
  can confirm , hit 13 degrees today . 
  a much more reasonable 9 degrees atm and raining . 
  always raining . 
  i hate this `` wage gap '' bullshit . 
  it 's sensationalism and exists just to imply men and women doing the same job get paid different amounts . 
  when they do n't . 
  move it to greece , they could n't afford to spy on anyone and could use the business . 
  im not saying we should n't be involved in syria , i think we should have been more involved from the start . 
  but wars ar n't popular and people are idiots . 
  if you ask them immigration and terrorism will be huge concerns with most against , but wanting to send troops out there to deal with the problem ? 
  oh no , ca n't have that !, 
  they 'd be against that too . 
  regardless you ca n't deny the vote against the principal of military involvement was ignored and we do have very recent habit of following america to war when they come calling . 
  because being `` war ravaged '' or even having a famine of biblical proportions does n't mean someone is a refugee . 
  by the legal definition most of these coming over here are not refugee 's fleeing persecution and have no rights to claim asylum . 
  they will not be given asylum and at best might have a temporary leave to stay . 
  so yes , someone can be against mass migration . 
  something like 30 % of turkeys refugee 's are in such camps and these refugee 's are never going to stop until the situation in syria is settled , which is n't likely to happen any time soon . 
  the vote was on military intervention in principal , not an invasion . 
  it was n't a `` yes we should invade or no we should n't '' it was a `` should we be thinking about this '' . 
  even if the commons had voted yes it still would have needed another vote before taking military action . 
  and the answer was no . 
  in principal the uk should not be taking any military intervention in syria . 
  yet we did and still will probably do . 
  edit : the exact motion that was rejected . 
  no mention of `` large scale '' or invasion and clear mention of a second vote being needed even if the first one was passed . 
  http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmagenda/ob130829.htm  agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may , if necessary , require military action that is legal , proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of syria 's chemical weapons ;  believes that the united nations security council must have the opportunity immediately to consider that briefing and that every effort should be made to secure a security council resolution backing military action before any such action is taken , ** and notes that before any direct british involvement in such action a * further * vote of the house of commons will take place **, 
   large scale . 
  i do n't remember that being part of the vote , i think you just added that to try and salvage some shred of an argument . 
   `` it is very clear tonight that , while the house has not passed a motion , it is clear to me that the british parliament , reflecting the views of the british people , * does not want to see british military action * . 
  i get that and the government will ** act accordingly . 
  ** '' `` act accordingly '' by sending over troops to train their army , having british pilots aiding americans bombing in syria and trying to get a [ mandate to bomb them for realsies this time ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/22/uk-mideast-crisis-cameron-syria-idukkcn0pw0yb20150722 ) . 
  yeah , he sure respected the will of the commons did n't he . 
  going to war when usa snaps it 's fingers is practically required in a leader . 
  wars happen . 
  just because one breaks out somewhere in the world does n't mean several million people now have the right to permanent residence in the eu . 
  a refugee must be :  outside their country of nationality or habitual residence ;  have a well-founded fear of persecution because of their race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group or political opinion ; and are unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country , or to return there , for fear of persecution .
