  i can no longer tell if sarcasm , it has to be sarcasm !, 
  but i 'll bite anyway . 
  [ we have troops in syria training their army ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11353094/british-troops-to-start-training-syrian-opposition.html ) and our pilots have been [ bombing is , in syria ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/17/david-cameron-knew-uk-pilots-were-bombing-isis-in-syria ) , alongside the americans . 
  although in this case the majority of people in britain would actually vote to stay in the eu anyway , so there is that at least . 
  processing camps should be set up in the countries they enter , funded by the whole eu . 
  those found to have genuine claims should be helped and/or resettled across europe . 
  those without valid claims should be shipped back to country of origin . 
  some of the more liberal mep 's maybe . 
  in reality it should probably read `` vastly outnumbered minority of mep 's want a binding scheme '' which to be fair the article does mention , just not in the headline . 
   i 'd argue that 's more to do with fptp and the uk electoral system in general . 
  id argue it 's because they got 3.8 % of the vote meaning more people voted for tories , labour , lib-dems , ukip and snp than them . 
   most people are more left-wing than people would expect [ we had a party that was pro nationalisation of the railways , anti nuke , anti tuition fees and anti war ] ( https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/manifesto/green_party_2015_general_election_manifesto_searchable.pdf ) . 
  they did shit , as they always do . 
  6th in terms of votes . 
  the trouble is when you start shifting to the right/left is a lot of people might agree with some of your ideas , but they 'll be put off by the other ones you 'll have . 
  it does no good picking a few issues that broadly appeal to people if they are going to be massively put off by your decision to ban rabbit cages , stop all spending on roads or mandatory equality and diversity lessons for schoolkids . 
   and now they 're irrelevant . 
  they 've always been a central party . 
  they only became irrelevant last election . 
  having a strong set of left/right wing views does n't do much good if you have zero political power . 
  you have to be elected . 
  besides it 's not populism , it 's the opposite . 
  syrzia is a left wing populist party , ukip is a right wing populist party . 
  if labour move left and more socialist they will either be populist , or wannabe populist like the green party . 
   most people do n't ally with the political spectrum . 
  no but most people hold moderate views , which is what centrism is . 
  moving away from the centre is moving away from the views of most people . 
  you can be centre-left or centre-right . 
  but not right or left . 
  milliband was weak and i think economy was a big factor , not many people wanted to reverse austerity `` just in case '' . 
  i also think most parties really dropped the ball and hardly even discussed immigration which led to ukips performance . 
  still , labour made gains on the tories and there was only something like 5 % difference . 
  going full blown socialist would do so much damage to the party . 
   as a socialist , i agree with what most of corbyn has to say and i hope he does well in the labour leadership election most people ar n't socialists , the vast majority are centrist . 
  moving left is to give up any chance of getting in power again . 
  libdems have been moving more central for years , even ukip moved central the last election and profited massively . 
  go full blow `` old labour left '' and there 's an actual chance labour wo n't even be the main opposition 10 years down the line . 
  we do n't have orphanages , bernado 's closed the last of theirs in the 70 's . 
  its a state run system now focused on fostering , support for vulnerable families etc. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deinstitutionalisation_%28orphanages_and_children%27s_institutions%29  it became common place in many developed countries in the post war period . 
  ** it has been taking place in eastern europe since the fall of communism and is now encouraged by the eu for new entrants ** . 
  it is also starting to take hold in africa and asia although often at individual institutions rather than state wide . 
  new systems generally cost less than those they replace as many more children are kept within their own family . 
  hence my surprise a country like greece still relies on them instead of providing a state system . 
  i doubt those countries cut welfare so bad orphanages had to spring up overnight to care for children that would otherwise be dumped on the streets . 
  i doubt they had the welfare systems in place to begin with . 
  which in greece 's case makes it 's public spending figures all the more impressive . 
  do n't really watch a lot of european films compared to asian . 
  but i would say france is probably the best with [ leon ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/ ) . 
  greece , italy ... 
  if you 're going to tell me spain also relies on charities to care for orphans instead of the state doing it i think i will have spotted a common denominator . 
  for once i agree with blair . 
  im actually amazed in a country like greece poor children are dumped off at charity run orphanages . 
  i could understand it in an eastern european country that suffered decades under soviet rule . 
  it 's been decided that a farmer using pesticide a , b and c counts as organic but a farmer who uses a , b and d is not . 
  [ regardless ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/29/french-children-farms-vineyards-exposed-dangerous-cocktail-pesticides ) of whether someone eats organic or non organic they still will still end up with the same pesticides in them . 
  the best organic can claim is to have [ slightly less than non-organic ] ( http://www.eufic.org/article/en/expid/organic_food_and_farming_scientific_facts_and_consumer_perceptions/ ) , sometimes . 
  ( although both fall well within safe amounts )  [ fifteen products were tested in their organic and conventional forms , including meat , milk , eggs , vegetables and cereals . 
  the median levels of contamination were calculated and compared with the recommended or regulated maximum levels . 
  ** the maximum levels were exceeded for lead in organic carrots and buckwheat ** , and in conventional wheat ; for cadmium , in ** both organic and conventional buckwheat ** ; for ** nitrates , in organic spinach ; and for patulin in organic apples ** . 
  moreover , contamination of ** both conventional and organic ** wheat by deoxynivalenol was observed with a ** higher level in organic products ** . 
  however , the health risk for consumers might be real only for the contamination by mycotoxins as the contaminated foods ( apples , wheat ) are the main contributors to total exposure ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02652030210123878#.va6tzkzmpuk ) . 
  its a hipster fad . 
  your post seems a bit all over the place but the reason organic food is n't a huge success story is because its always been a fad for people with more money than braincells . 
  organic food is more expensive , more labour intensive , and requires much more land than normal farming to produce the same yield . 
  then you have the issue of organic food not having any increased nutritional value and still usually contains pesticides . 
  either stick to what we do or double down and go full gmo , organic is just hipster trash . 
  im going to go with opportunist as well . 
  it implys they have no morals and seek every opportunity to advance themselves . 
   a person who often does not have competent and professional qualifications , and the place is set for kin , native , friendly or party membership or eligibility . 
  the second definition he gave is completely different from the first though . 
  that would be nepotism . 
  given his track record in astounding incompetence when it comes to being a finance minister , why is everything he says deserving of its own article ? 
   if you want really free capitalism good one !, 
  we 're talking about the same dairy industry that forced margarine to be dyed red in some states simply because they had the power to and wanted to kill it off . 
  when an american business talks about freedom they mean '' * we * should be free to do what we want , the other guys should n't '', 
  hard to think of $ 42 billion debt as a huge issue for a country the size of russia when we 've been discussing the 100 's of billions debt of greece has for 5 months . 
  refugee 's ar n't entitled to travel freely due to schengen , just like they ar n't entitled to travel across several european countries before choosing one to claim asylum in . 
  my opinion on the matter is based on on the status of the people in question . 
  genuine refugees , people who 's claim has been decided as valid , should be spread around the eu to help ease the burden on the countries recieving them . 
  asylum seekers ( ppl 's who 's claim is not decided ) and economic migrants should 100 % not be moved to another country . 
  but we should provide help and aid to the countries dealing with the problem until they are either granted refugee status or declared illegal immigrants . 
  i would say across europe immigration and greece are major issues in every country . 
  maybe not the biggest , but in the top 5 . 
  i would also guess a significant amount of people in europe are against illegal immigration and/or blame greece for thier current problems . 
  i would also say this sub is probably more liberal in its views to both issues than the european public at large . 
  regards , someone who thinks greece is mainly to blame and is opposed to illigal immigration . 
  takes money and effort , not to mention being totally abhorrent to the left . 
  letting them vanish into the black market economy is so much eaiser . 
  out of sight out of mind . 
  send them back you mean ? 
  it 's not like you can dump them in a country that is n't thier own and they ar n't very obliging in telling you where they come from . . in case you know , you try and send them back . 
  i think complaining that people tar all gypsies/islamics with the same brush while generalising this entire sub is a massive amount of hypocrisy . 
  almost as big as wanting to delete all opinions you find objectionable while hoping to promote free and open discussion . 
  if you want a left wing circle jerk to hate on everyone poltically to the right of you , goto tumblr . 
  if you want a right wing circle jerk to hate on everyone poltically to the left of you , goto / pol / . 
  if you can have a serious grown up discussion and tolerate people with different views , stay here . 
  not often i say this , because i do n't think someone should get praise for merely being competent at thier job , but i think the moderation on here is pretty good . 
  questionable , editorialised or biased articles will be removed . 
  outright hate and personal attacks are not tolerated .
