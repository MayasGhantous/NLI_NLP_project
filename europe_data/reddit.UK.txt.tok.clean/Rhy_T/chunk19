  personally i think its sad that the far left used to be about freedom and progressiveness and now its all about censorship and forcing thier worldview on others . 
  you guys are out in force today . 
  [ is this something you get paid to do or is it pro bono ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dyhl5/islamophobia_on_reurope/?sort=old ), 
  yes , you should leave . 
  you might find the fact not everyone will agree with you `` triggering '' . 
  you can take your holier than thou attitude with you as well , mkay . 
  im glad theres no place on this sub for hate speech or descrimination . 
  but that does n't mean i think the entire website should be censored because some peoples feeling might get hurt if they choose to visit such places . 
  and thats why i would be opposed , everyone has a varying definition of hate speech and descrimination . 
  i suspect the op 's definition is a lot wider than mine is . 
  i submit to you , boris johnson . 
   my speaking style was criticised by no less an authority than arnold schwarzenegger . 
  it was a low moment , my friends , to have my rhetorical skills denounced by a [ monosyllabic austrian cyborg . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/london-mayor-election/mayor-of-london/10909094/boris-johnsons-top-50-quotes.html ) or  [ on george w bush ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-468727/a-selection-boris-johnsons-memorable-quotes.html )  `` the president is a cross-eyed texan warmonger , unelected , inarticulate , who epitomises the arrogance of american foreign policy . '', 
  when he said porn thing i thought he was talking about the law they passed that banned the uk porn industry from depicting such perverse sex acts such as [ female ejaculation and facesitting . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/a-long-list-of-sex-acts-just-got-banned-in-uk-porn-9897174.html ) i forgot about the pressuring the isp 's to turn filters on by default because parents are too stupid to do it themselves . 
  still , at least they do n't want to do something * really * stupid like trying to [ undermine encryption ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/uk-government-not-going-to-ban-encryption-2015-7 ) or [ conduct mass surveillance on the population . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33564442 ) its lucky for us that thier ideas are too stupid and downright unworkable to actually have an effect . 
   because it 's easier to say chauve-souris than bat i do love my words and decided to look into bat as it 's such an unusual one . 
  looks like the old english word for them was * hreremus * and they were also called rattle-mouse , flitter-mouse etc. 
  we stole bat from your part of the world with it [ probably coming from the old swedish natbakka or old danish nathbakk\u00e6 . 
  ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bat ), 
  do n't get the point of this , it should be called `` 9 words/phrases i think are better in french than english '' usually on lists of words we should have in english you see things like `` schadenfreude '' which would be a very good word to have , hence most english people on here will know what it means . 
  [ we 're currently in the process of stealing it . 
  ] ( http://www.oed.com/view/entry/172271?redirectedfrom=schadenfreude#eid ) most those `` choices '' in that article we already have words for . 
  bat ? 
  depression ? 
  cabbage ? 
  and do n't get me started on * avoir le cafard * . 
  we have a phrase that means to have the cockroaches in english as well it goes like this : `` to have the cockroaches '', 
  big assumption to make there assuming all ukip voters are actually right wing . 
  a number of votes would have been tactical , some protest votes and they are basically a meme party . 
  i bet just as many libdem/labour voters switched to voting ukip as did tory voters . 
  also just wanted to point out that tories are pretty much `` new labour lite '' these days . 
  passed same sex marrige laws , they 'll be campaigning to stay in europe and thier immigration policy is almost identical to labours . 
  theres very little conservative about the conservative party anymore . 
  most of the time when people immigrate and want to retain thier culture theres no issue . 
  but sometimes , like with fgm or radical islam , that culture is incompatible with western values . 
  preventing people from travelling and arresting people who have it carried out on relatives is well and good , but it 's likley to breed resentment among those who view it as part of thier culture . 
  the trick is to live somewhere with literally nothing worth blowing up . 
  i think i experienced that on holidays once . 
  i hated it . 
  then again i also hated how flat the land was . 
  i get homesick if im not surrounded by valleys and wet . 
   greek economy was not doing well until january . 
  it was doing better than it has been * since * january . 
  what do you mean `` sometimes '' ? 
  why is the imf still lending money ? 
  i thought i read that after defaulting on thier repayments thier rules prevented them from lending more . 
   what wil be next ? 
  saying ` compare yourselves with nigeria , you are better ' ? 
  theres talk about greece needing humanitatian aid regardless of if a bailout is agreed . 
  so yes , being better off than nigeria is a positive . 
  if greece ever wants to borrow money again they 'll have to pay off debts . 
  all countries borrow money to run . 
  this assumption that greece can just declare bankruptcy and the debts will vanish is wrong . 
  ask argentina . 
  the debts will only go away if the creditors decide they do , which is n't going to happen and considering they were what 20 ? 
  30 year loans it does n't really matter if greece spends a decade climbing out of the hole its dug itself . 
   if greece gets out of $ , we 'll have to foot the $ 350 billion . 
  eurozone is footing that money anyway on long terms and the debt wo n't magically dissapear if greece leaves . 
  they 'll still end up paying it eventually . 
  battle lines are being drawn . 
  should be an interesting day tomorrow . 
  greece might need 84 billion euros ? 
  was n't it 50 something to begin with ? , then 70 . 
  printing money and stimulus are not options for a country in a monetary union and debt relief in itself does nothing unless its combined with printing money or austerity . 
  greece 's options are , and have always been , the same . 
  austerity or turbo austerity . 
   really ? 
  you can say that with a straight face . 
  yes because this is the real world not some hippies wet dream where the eu decides to write a blank check to support greece for x many decades while it slowly deals with the issue . 
  greece has the same two options its always had , managed austerity or ohshithwhathavewedone austerity via crashing out of the euro . 
  after 5 months of dicking around and making the situation in greece ** far ** worst syrzia have finally woken upto the fact austerity is the best option . 
  maybe they should have commited to the reforms , accepted a deal in january and we could be negotiating a third bailout with debt restructing now . 
  but no , they elected populist idiots who 've done nothing but make things worst for 5 months and no-one is forcing greece to do this , they are free to try the alternative . 
  but even sryzia have woken up to the fact the alternative is even worst . 
  it was vitally important that they held a referendum on a non final bailout offer that had exipred . 
  not so much for the offer itself , but to give the greek people thier chance to have a say on austerity !, 
  just because they 've turned round and now have to offer an even harsher deal does n't diminish the referendum in any way . 
  oh russia , you so crazy !, 
  my understanding was he 's facing pressure from all sides in his party . 
  some wanting him to take a hardline , some worried a deal wo n't be reached . 
  regardless if he does cross his redlines and do a deal , he 'd not only have the greek parliment to contend with but probably the greek public as well . 
  who appear to be very much opposed to austerity . 
  does n't matter how fancy you word it , both sides aims are incompatible and have been all along . 
  syrzia wo n't accept austerity and wants debt relief , the eu does n't want to give debt relef without serious measurable commitment to cuts . 
  unless one side is going to cave in on its `` red lines '' it 's doomed to rejection no matter who puts it together . 
  my claim is based on my own observations and public polling . 
  despite what reddit would have you beleive most people in europe think greece is mainly to blame , so why would anti eu sentiment rise over this ? 
  if anything it 's likley to strenghten . 
  indeed in the uk support for staying in the eu was at an all time high this june . 
  breaking the previous record , which was in 2014 . 
  and yet britain is becoming even more pro eu than it was before this started and currently [ 41 % of brits ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/07/02/british-voters-side-troika-greek-debt-crisis/ ) think this problem is caused entirely by greece . 
  [ 60 % of germans say greece should leave the eurozone ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/03/17/majority-germans-favour-grexit/ ) and , in fact , [ in every country bar france the majority think greece should leave the eu rather than stay . 
  ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/25/europeans-expect-grexit-happen-and-few-want-stop-i/ ) do n't let the internet echo chamber fool you . 
  i claim anyone who does n't portray greece as the victim gets downvoted and then idiots will appear claiming this place is a right wing circle jerk . 
  i then get downvoted and you appear and call this place a right wing circle jerk . 
   it 's a legit definition , not something made by scary ess jay dubyas yet no dictionary or thesaurus states such a thing under `` sexism '' or `` racism '' .
