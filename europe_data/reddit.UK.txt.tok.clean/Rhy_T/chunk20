  the only people who talk about `` positons of power '' are the type of brain dead extreme sjw 's who have no other way to hide thier own hypocrisy . 
  the type of extremists who give the word liberal a bad name . 
  you can take your stupid `` x people ca n't be x because they 're not in a position of power '' reasoning back to tumblr . 
  one side potrayed the other a bunch nazi 's who caused untold real life misery and the other drew a stupid cartoon sterotype . 
  everyone knows the greeks are completley innocent and nothing is thier fault . 
  its the lenders fault , the bankers fault , the ecb 's , the imf , merkels etc. 
  say or do anything to imply greece not might be anything other than an innocent victims ? 
  and then they 'll complain that stormfront is brigading and this place is now just a right wing circle jerk anyway . 
  you 're right . 
  comparing a politician you do n't like to a genocidal , mass murdering , ethnic cleansing group who caused milllions of lost lives is nowhere near as bad as a sterotype implying greeks are fat moochers . 
   60 years after the fact . 
  70 years now . 
  i too find it deeply offensive that people try and use that as as an argument , even more offensive than all the comparisons of merkel/germans as nazi 's throught this . 
  hard to beleive the people making these comparisons probably consider themselves liberal or left leaning . 
  greece has had [ 50 % of its debt ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15478358 ) owned by banks written off already . 
  and the eu might be willing to discuss a second haircut , it would be hard to avoid giving another one , if greece agrees to actually reform for a change . 
   euro zone members have given greece until the end of the week to * come up with a proposal for sweeping reforms * in return for loans that will keep the country from crashing out of europe 's currency bloc and into economic ruin . 
  well i hate to be cynical but i think i see a stumbling block . 
  recent yougov polls done in june/july showed record high support for staying in europe beating last years previous record high . 
  i think if anything the crisis showed the need for a little solidarity esp when times are tough . 
  unfortunatley for geece atm it seems most of euope is united in its desire to not give them another bailout unless serious reforms are implemented . 
  greece had a primary surplus at the end of 2014 correct . 
  they also had sustainable debt . 
  now they have neither . 
  both mysetiously vanished the second it looked like the meme `` we 're going to end austerity '' party would make large gains . 
  and speaking the last 5 months , how has greece 's economy been doing the last 5 months ? 
  how has it done since the referendum was called for example ? 
  it 's constantly got worst and will continue to do so for some time . 
  the debt was sustainable 10 months ago . 
  syrzias constant screwing around has left greece in a far worst position than when they came to power . 
  so they kicked you orrible germans and your silly reforms out ... [ then immediately lived beyond thier means , got into debt , joined a single currency , failed to reform or collect taxes and then got ejected from the single currency union ? 
  ] ( http://marketmonetarist.com/2012/06/13/remember-the-last-time-greece-was-kicked-out-of-a-monetary-union/ ) is that about right ? 
   i think we 'll pass this time why ? 
  [ what could go wrong ? 
  ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/9/96/germanyball_euro.gif/revision/latest?cb=20150224222959 ) embrace what you are germany !, 
  become the villan we need instead of the one we deserve . 
  maybe if you fully commit to it eu will offer you a debt haircut like greece got , or maybe lower interst rates or longer repayment like the ones greece got . 
  maybe you might be offered a second bailout if you need it ... like greece got . 
  did you make a similar [ post ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ofbhbis7a_8/tqrgko3d6di/aaaaaaaahte/mtvobowzrzm/s400/furious%2bgreeks%2blampoon%2bgerman%2boverlords%2bas%2bnazis%2bwith%2bpicture%2bof%2bmerkel%2bdressed%2bas%2ban%2bss%2bguard%2b1.jpg ) when [ everyone ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a7kvrdsowde/tzwu7sbeubi/aaaaaaaacpw/8qbboc6zb14/s1600/article-0-11a81f35000005dc-144_634x437.jpg ) was [ doing pictures ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/09/article-2214972-156b0905000005dc-885_634x403.jpg ) of [ merkel ] ( http://www.les-crises.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/t96a03d_griechenland-nazi-merkel-01.jpg ) as a [ nazi ?

  [ 13 months ago the debt was sustainable . 
  ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43044.0 ) after a couple months of that clown as finance minister suddenly it is n't . 
  maybe a further haircut would have been on the cards in a third bailout package . 
  we 'll never know because of the actions of that man . 
  they 've made greece far worst off than it was when they came to power and people still try to blame ze germans or ze heartless bankers . 
  because after years of weak reform efforts and sryzia even going backwards they ca n't be trusted to do them ? 
  because theres a high chance that they 'll just come back a couple years down the road for a fourth bailout ? 
   no more fourth reich well all know you guys are just biding your time , [ waiting to reich up again !, 
  ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/9/96/germanyball_euro.gif/revision/latest?cb=20150224222959 ) we should let france lead instead , they can be trusted with the responsibility and probably wo n't try to conquer europe ... 
   well i was only talking about if imf funds are used which i think everyone agrees it is legit for japan and us to have some influence there . 
  well they ar n't so you do n't . 
  now if greece collapsing concerns you so much feel free bail them out yourselves . 
  you 're perfectly free to lend greece as much as you want for whatever terms you want . 
  basically , put up or shut up . 
   should at least give us some say in what deals are reached with imf money . 
  imf wo n't be offering any deals because greece defaulted on an imf loan . 
  unless america/japan is prepared to loan greece 100 billion euros you can sit down and shut up , because it does n't involve you . 
  [ spain receivecd # 35 in bailout money . 
  ] ( http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-spain-exits-international-bailout-20140123-story.html ) [ cut # 21 billion from the budget ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17557172 ) , [ spent # 13 billion stimulating the economy ] ( http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/latest/spain-unveils-21bn-stimulus-package/story-e6frg90f-1111118166193 ) and its the same for all the other countries . 
  they made large cuts to spending ( austerity ) and used fraction of that money to stimulate the economy . 
  greece has received # 300 billion so far and still has n't cut spending anywhere near enough . 
  its not the fault of the evil germans or greedy bankers , it 's greece 's fault . 
  they hav n't even gone through austerity , yet . 
  but they are about too . 
  oh wow who would have thought cutting spending would lead to decreased gdp !, 
  thats never happened with austerity before / s why do n't you link the gdp growth rate which clearly shows a reduction in defecit year on year leading to positive growth in 2014 . 
  growth that abruptly ended when a certain party was about to come into power . 
  or how about you show us what happened with gdp in spain ? 
  [ well i never !, 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/gdp ) or [ portugal ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/gdp ) or [ italy ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/gdp ) or [ ireland ? 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/gdp ) why did n't you show us them ? 
  is it because they completley contradict your claim about austerity causing it and that greece is mysteriously the only one affected . 
  i see nothing in there that even * implies * austerity does n't work . 
  what i see is youth unemployment rising , peaking in 2013 then falling for all three countries , funnily enough just like it did in britain and ireland . 
  maybe * just maybe * how bad austerity hits is proportional to how messed up your economy is to begin with . 
   quite the opposite . 
  from your link : in the creditors own words : `` it is clear that the policy slippages and uncertainties ** of the last months ** have made the achievement of the 2012 targets impossible under any scenario '' . 
  yet another greece defender posting an article which completley contradicts what he claims it does . 
  or how about this [ imf report ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43044.0 ) from the 2nd july . 
   by late summer 2014 , with interest rates having declined further , * it appeared that no further debt relief would have been needed under the november 2012 framework * , ** if ** the program were to have been implemented as agreed . 
  ** but significant changes in policies since then ** -- not least , lower primary surpluses and ** a weak reform effort ** that will weigh on growth and privatization -- are leading to substantial new financing needs . 
  so both of our links claim austerity was working and the 2012 framework was going to be correct right up until syrzia came into power . 
  still waiting for evidence austerity does n't work . 
  yet all the evidence ( as in the latest imf report and the fact every other country has suceeded ) points to the fact austerity works . 
  but im sure armchair economists writing for left wing newspapers are far more knowledgable . 
  germany had been bombed to oblivion and invaded from all sides . 
  they didnt live beyond thier means for years , thier industry and infastructure was wiped out . 
  germany submitted entirely and followed whatever demands its creditors wanted . 
  and , as others have mentioned , a strong germany was needed for europe because of the russian threat . 
  apart from it being completley different in every way , its a good comparison . 
  i agree , i think it 's a lot like when they refused to increase ela . 
  they could have pulled the trigger , they could have made things easier . 
  they decided to maintain the status quo , giving the screw a half twist , leaving just enough for greece to scrape by for a few more days . 
  quelle surprise . 
  from the bbc live feed . 
   the european central bank ( ecb ) will not be adjusting the amount of funding given to greek banks . 
  in a statement , the ecb said : `` ela ( emergency liquidity assistance ) can only be provided against sufficient collateral . '', 
  ... and much of that collateral includes defaulted debt . 
  who would have thought it eh ? 
  they followed the rules like they said they would when they froze it .
