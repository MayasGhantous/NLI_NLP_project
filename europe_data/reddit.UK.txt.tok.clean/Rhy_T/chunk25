  so yeah , it was an `` unprecedented massacre '' , if you ignore the election that came before and the one that 's going to come up next . 
   going by labour 's core tenets , labours core tenets are * supposed * to be the unions and the working class . 
  those who want an anti war , anti nuke , vegetarian pacifist vote green . 
  instead of traditional labour voters swapping to lib dem how about all the students/left wing nut jobs vote green/libdems . 
  they can take corbyn with them . 
  ive yet to see germany put forward a reasonable proposition yet either . 
  just the same dumb one repeatedly . 
  closing the borders and containing the free flow of illegal immigrants is a good first step though . 
  should have been done 6 months ago . 
  just because scotland is happy having a strop and would rather guarantee tory wins for the foreseeable future does n't mean labour should become a joke . 
  which it is with corbyn in charge . 
  forget being a credible goverment party , it 's not even a credible opposition party atm . 
  im actually a labour voter . 
  my views would be left wing , or left of centre at least . 
  and if we 're talking about dumb populist policies that do nothing but appeal to emotion look no further than mr `` i want to bring back the mining industry but am opposed to fossil fuels and nuclear power '' corbyn . 
  or mr `` im a pacifist and hate violence but the ira is totally cool you guys '' corbyn . 
  he 'd be more at home in the green party . 
  anti war , sandal wearing vegetarian . 
  cameron might be a smug twat but id prefer him in charge over corbyn any day of the week . 
  amazing what certain countries in the eu are willing to overlook and do to fellow other eu countries in order to appear humane in the media ,, 
   and the eu as a whole have n't done anything to help that 's because the only thing that 's been on the table is redistribution . 
  whenever anyone suggests or tries anything other than that germany throws a fit . 
  it 's been `` our way or the highway '' crap from merkel since it started . 
  more like a warning against dumb short-sighted `` feelings '' based policies . 
  the type of rubbish you would expect an undergrad humanities student to come up with . 
  whaddya know . 
  i agree with a guardian article for once . 
  this has got to be one of the stupidest , most ignorant things ive read in my 19 years of browsing the web . 
  so congrats i guess ? 
  what 's this drivel about eu citizenship ? ... 
  likening uk leaving the eu to making people stateless ? ... 
  thinking the eu has a military ... not knowing that scotland , falklands and gibraltar have had referendums and wales has zero interest ... thinking that leaving the eu is `` preventing people from travelling '' ... thinking the eu can get it 's shit together enough to invade/force the uk to do anything when it ca n't strong arm turkey . 
  im not embarrassed , i 'll probably forget what i learned about the ecr before a week has passed because i genuinely do n't care about the different factions in the eu parliament . 
   the european conservatives and reformists ( ecr ) [ 1 ] is a eurosceptic [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] and anti-federalist [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 10 ] political group in the european parliament shock horror !, 
  the chair of a euro sceptic and anti-federalist group has come out in favour of a brexit . 
  what a devastating thing to happen , im sure no-one saw that coming . 
  i had to google who he and what the ecr is . 
  pretty pathetic to trumpet that news as a `` heavy blow '' . 
  anyone undecided , or with `` stay '' leanings , is not going to give the slightest crap about this . 
  `` mystery '', 
  im surprised labour even know the meaning of the word `` credibility '' right now . 
  how about these for credible sources .

  news to me , i was n't aware anybody took it seriously . 
  * especially * the human rights council . 
  that thing where saudi arabia is head of the panel that appoints `` independent experts '' . 
  experts that are quite silent about saudi arabia mass executing people and numerous other human rights abuses . 
  yeah , lets listen to those guys . 
  pretty meaningless `` article '' really . 
   the fund will remain a long-term investor . 
  there are long-term risks and there are short-term risks . 
  brexit is more in the latter category yeah , whatever the outcome britain will have recovered in 20 years time . 
  [ oldest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_alliance ) alliance in the world . 
   you would rather give them visa free travel than a secular country with a power-hungry guy in charge lol the supreme leader of iran is hardly more powerful than the queen both being the commander and chief of the armed forces . 
  there 's not been a proven case of someone being executed just for homosexuality since 1990 and nuclear weapons ? 
  lol . 
  yeah they are so determined it 's a wonder we just dropped all sanctions against them . 
  and yes , id give iran visas over turkey anyday . 
  young people in iran are little different from people in the west . 
  iran is the leading ally of america in the middle east in the fight against is while turkey has been caught supplying them weapons and actively helping them against the kurds on numerous occasions . 
  you 're asking me would i rather have thousands of turks or iranians in europe on visa free travel ? 
  iranians , every day of the week . 
  no contest . 
  iran is a country the west should be getting closer with and using it 's soft pressure to change . 
  it 's been pretty well behaved for a long time and is making steps in the right direction . 
  turkey is moving backwards and can go fuck itself . 
  because when we send them to camps in another country we do n't get more back from that country . 
  it 's called reducing the amount we have running round europe . 
  a difficult concept for you to follow . 
   an election is like an auction . 
  * cough * trump * cough *, 
   you have yet to make a single coherent argument against my points , but please , tell me more about how ridiculously naive i am . 
  i blew them completely apart , you do n't even have an argument left , which is why you 're just ignoring the fact the proposals will see zero decrease in the amount of people we take in and repeating yourself . 
  you want a solution other than shooting them as they arrive ? 
  ( which is a completely pathetic fucking argument trotted out by absolute cunts btw ) we set up camps , here or in a safe third country , we hold them , we process them and those who are rejected get deported , those who 're valid stay in the camps and when the war is over they get sent back . 
  asylum means we give you safety and shelter , nothing more . 
  one person one vote !, 
  * ** provided you 're not a women , black , native american or poor . 
  id wager a decent amount of ukip 's support do n't even care about the eu issue and are more worried about migrants . 
  migrants will still be a big issue whether we leave or stay . 
  i would n't expect them to suffer much in the event we do leave . 
  probably just rebrand themselves as the `` further right and harsher on migrants than the tories party '', 
  no im saying that doing something that will see zero decrease in the numbers arriving is not `` a solution to the crisis '' and that i should n't be surprised to see ridiculously naive comments come from a german flair . 
  encouraging more migrants , sucking upto turkey , bullying every country who disagrees with you about quotas . 
  all in some pathetic crusade to feel moral . 
   and of all muslim countries , turkey ? 
  yes because unlike other islamic countries turkey is n't the type to have an authoritarian leader , censor and take control of the media or shoot rubber bullets at women for having a rally to celebrate international woman 's day . 
  that 's ignoring all the crap going on with the kurds and is . 
  id rather give iran fucking visa free travel than turkey . 
  it 's shameful . 
  but a bit rich coming from america . 
  i hate to burst that little fantasy bubble you live in but you seem to to think that just because the deal `` happens '' the migrants will just stop trying to come over . 
  given your flair though it 's understandable . 
   the one-for-one deal is only for syrians . 
  we do n't have to take a syrian for a migrant , only for every syrian . 
  that means if 30 % are syrian , we 're swapping 100k migrants for 30k refugees . 
  considering around 50 % of those taking the route to greece are syrians and turkey has 2.7 million of them that 's not much better . 
  if we get 1.5 million total immigrants landing and swap 750k syrians for other syrians we still have the problem of an extra 750k syrians arriving this year . 
  that 's not a solution . 
  that 's not even better .
