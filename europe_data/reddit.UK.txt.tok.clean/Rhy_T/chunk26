   how is this deal not everything people have asked for ? 
  because it does nothing ? 
  swapping 100k migrants for 100k refugees is not a solution and if anything it encourages turkey to do even less . 
  guy a boats to greece . 
  guy a gets swapped with refugee b in turkey . 
  guy a boats to greece again under a new name . 
  guy a gets swapped with refugee c from turkey . 
   tonga they just come and play in our rugby teams and gain citizenship that way . 
  besides , tongan 's do n't need a visa to come to the eu so they can just get a passport and hop on a plane . 
   greek coast guards picked up migrants from syria , afghanistan , ** nepal ** and pakistan starting to take the piss now . 
  no , his was entirely based on opinion . 
   i have come to the conclusion that the eu is incapable of meaningful reform , at least in the foreseeable future . '', 
  an opinion that 60 % of his members disagree with . 
  its a pretty big dick move actually . 
  * bcc polls members * 60 % want to stay * 30 % leave * decide to remain neutral as it 's membership is split . 
  * chief makes pro leaving comments despite twice as many members wanting to stay . 
  not the fucking same at all . 
  one is the governor of the bank of england stating to the treasury committee that leaving the eu presents the `` biggest domestic risk to financial stability '' . 
  which is a 100 % factual and non partisan claim . 
  he also highlighted there were risks associated with staying ... and that global risks such as china are a more serious concern . 
  what 's he supposed to say ? 
  leaving europe , or the prospect of leaving europe , will have no effect on britain 's economy ? 
  the other is a guy who chose to break the bcc 's already decided position on neutrality , and make pro leaving comments , while 60 % of the bcc 's members want to stay in the eu and only 30 % leave . 
   and registering tens of thousands of people in a chaotic state yeah , shame about the * hundreds * of thousands you just wave through to the macedonian border . 
  how dare they stop you just offloading everything onto the rest of the eu . 
  i always laugh at greeks complaining about the 30k refugees they have and ignore the fact most of the million refugees germany recived last year came through greece . 
  because industry/agriculture was allowed to die off practically everywhere and all the investment and focus has been on london . 
  we used to have a massive coal industry , gone . 
  steel industry ? 
  [ going ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34581945 ) . 
  hows our farming industry doing ? 
  badly and completely reliant on eu subsidies . 
  oh but we must [ protect the finance industry in london ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-cbi-idukkcn0sv20u20151106 ) at any cost . 
  london should be taxed even higher and that money should be invested in improving infrastructure and encouraging industry for the rest of the country . 
  he would prefer to avoid the referendum altogether . 
  like he did last time he won , when [ he 'd previously promised a referendum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq2n7omcsi0 ) under pressure from his own party . 
  come to think of it even tony blair back in 2005 promised a referendum on europe . 
  [ all three parties did ] ( http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/factcheck%20who%20promised%20euro%20vote/1714147.html ) . 
  it 's popped up fairly regularly as an issue in the uk , every year for over a decade . 
  the reason we 're finally having one is because it 's been put off as long as humanly possible . 
  maybe if ** germany ** could stop forcing its will on the rest of europe , and turning crisis like greece/refugees into full blown disasters that 'd be swell . 
  at this rate the `` out '' campaign wo n't even have to bother , you 'll have done their work for them . 
  whataboutism . 
  the vast majority of the country is not so lucky , takes me an hour to go 15 miles on public transport . 
  you get such transport/business investment because it benefits london companies to do so . 
  that 's it . 
  other cities ar n't so lucky and i wager you overstate it 's effect on birmingham . 
   defaulting is something which any state can do and wipes away debts  this only goes to show how little you know about economics and the world in general . 
  you just proved we know more about economics in wales than greeks do . 
  a sovereign state defaulting and wiping away debts ? 
  2 seconds on google will have showed you that 's not how it works in the real world . 
  it might work that way in the `` fantasy finance '' land greeks live in . 
  but not the real world . 
  the debts disappear when the creditors say they do , not the debtor . 
  london , like greece , can drop off the map for all anyone who does n't live there will care . 
  and no , a country ca n't `` file for bankruptcy '' and `` reverting to the drachma '' wo n't make the debts go away either . 
  the `` referendum '' you guys had just showed what a joke your country is from top to bottom . 
  tsipras for trying to pass the buck onto the public for something that was unavoidable , the idiots who think like you do about `` the drachma '' and `` declaring bankruptcy '' or tsipras again for underestimating just how dumb the greek public is when it comes to money matters . 
  and then he went ahead and singed up for it anyway . 
  like everyone `` with a brain '' knew he would . 
  yeah heaven forbid countries recovering from the worst recession in a generation should worry about themselves and not just toss everything to a country that 's been freeloading so long it practically runs off corruption . 
  i know you greeks are accustomed to pissing away funds on whatever you please but you misunderstand what `` bailout '' means . 
  it meant `` we give you x to pay your critical debts , ones owed to banks from years of irresponsible borrowing '' not `` we give you x !, 
  ofc most of the money went to banks , that 's because your country owed them a shitload of money and was about to default . 
  you want to have money to spend on what you please ? 
  do n't we all . 
  sort your finances out and you can . 
   why the heck are we even part of this joke of a union ? 
  to mooch money , piss it away on corruption and blackmail us when we do n't give you more ? 
  that 's what you get for being a slacker and taking art and pe at gcse instead of history . 
  cost does n't come into it . 
  even the parents of the poorest kid on meal tickets could afford a couple # a week . 
  i went to a state school , in the welsh valleys , after the mining industry collapsed and still got to goto paris and belguim on school trips . 
  and yes , we visited the graves in belguim . 
  greece did have a responsibility to process `` asylum seekers '' and that involves not letting them waltz all over fucking europe . 
  they could at least have fingerprinted them and registered them , but no . 
  that 's asking too much . 
  it would have meant doing something instead of just waving them through to the rest of europe . 
  i realise the eu and greece does n't quite have the resources and capabilities of countries like lebanon and turkey to house refugees * but we could have at least got some details to keep track of them . 
  * that 's how to use sarcasm . 
  do n't care . 
  the eu ( read germany ) has had months to come up with a solution but has done less than nothing . 
  instead of limiting arrivals they welcomed and encouraged more to make the journey . 
  instead of documenting and processing so called `` asylum seekers '' on arrival they allowed them to roam over europe , even getting pissy when countries started instituting border checks or putting up walls to actually do that . 
  instead of coming up with a viable plan they 've been trying to force through the same dead idea about `` quotas '' . 
  that 's not a solution , its spreading the problem around . 
  greece is just as guilty too , it 's not even tried to keep immigrants there , or register them and keeps insisting on the quota idea . 
  good on macedonia and all the other countries closing the borders to the migrants . 
  lol `` civil war '' . 
  you say you 're not russian and if that 's the case you must be some american college student to be that clueless and naive . 
  russia props up corrupt leader . 
  people overthrow said corrupt leader , because who the hell in thier right mind wants to be close to russia ? 
  the `` totally not in league with russia '' leader flees to russia . 
  russia invades ukraine . 
  lol `` civil war '' , that 's fucking rich . 
  http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/indicators greece may have problems , a lot of them , but it ' still a functioning democracy where leaders of the opposition and journalists can expect not to get murdered in the street . 
  i doubt russia even counts as a developed country anymore . 
  trying to turn your back on russia and it 's corruption and have closer integration with the eu now makes you a failed state . 
  99 % of ukraine 's problems come from russia , and im not just talking about the current invasion either . 
  because it practically is a failed state .
