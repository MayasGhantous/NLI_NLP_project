  such a drama queen . 
  if they break the law they 'll get arrested . 
  they can still be arrested for crimes and be jailed even if they are illegal immigrants you know . 
  if they 'd rather starve on the streets than return to their own country then that 's their choice , no-one is forcing them to do anything . 
   which one do you expect to generate the best results best results for whom ? 
  the dutch government ? 
  the method they are trying . 
  the illegal immigrants ? 
  no doubt they would prefer just to be left free to stay and have food/shelter provided for them . 
  or they could just cooperate with the deportation process since these measure only affect those people who 's asylum claim has been rejected . 
  they have no right to be in the country and wo n't leave . 
  why should the dutch have to pay to feed and shelter them ? 
  actually its the same in the uk [ ** law ** . 
  ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tough-new-rape-laws-mean-5062141 ) if the aforementioned landwhale turned round and accused the man of rape he would have to prove she consented . 
  not implied consent , or allowing it to just happen , actual consent . 
  if the guy was too drunk to remember ? 
  well tough shit , rapist . 
  as far as im concerned if two drunk people have sex then they 're both to blame , ca n't have a legal system where one can later turn round and accuse the other of rape . 
  i remember being a student and one of the guys on my course getting blind drunk and shagging a landwhale one regrettable evening . 
  oh how we laughed at the sight of them snogging . 
  sends a chill down my spine now when i look back and realise i actually watched a guy getting raped and instead of support we took the piss and ribbed him for a couple weeks about it . 
  nope , just an ordinary non religiously affiliated primary school . 
  it 's not so much `` creationism '' , i do n't think they teach evolution to 7 year olds , more like she 's being taught the bible is the word of god kind of crap . 
  this is the `` collective worship policy '' :  * to help pupils develop spiritual and moral awareness by means of acts of collective worship , which is broadly christian in character . 
   * to foster in pupils a sense of awe and wonder , through a process of worship , prayer and contemplation . 
   * to explore other world religions and cultural links . 
  only as far as i can tell its 99 % christian worship and 1 % learning what all the heathens in the rest of the world believe . 
  if it was n't for the fact i do n't want to be `` that guy '' i would have complained to my local primary school years ago about the amount of religious twaddle they teach my daughter as fact . 
  i get really pissed off when she starts sentences with `` dad , did you know that jesus/god/the angels ... '' i do n't mind her learning about religion as an academic thing , where she would learn about all faiths . 
  but not this indoctrination into one neither of her parents believe in . 
   the mountains are made of it . . not anymore :( they are getting removed . 
  i know they are unsafe and dirty but they were fun to play on as a kid . 
  i stopped drinking in my mid 20 's , it 'd be better for my health if i actually started again as a moderate amount is good for you . 
  wish i found smoking as easy to give up . 
  pont = bridge , pwl = pool , could n't have picked a more straightforward one tbh . 
  only need a few key phrases like caer , maes , cwm and llan and you can work out what most places mean . 
  i 'd argue what 's the point because there are a number of positives to being in the eu and a number of negatives that come with closer integration . 
  especially given the way the eu is currently ( dis ) organised . 
  besides , kicking the can down the road and maintaining the status quo is practically an eu tradition . 
  there 's a kind of irony about it . 
  i fail to see anything about it worth celebrating . 
  they knew the earth was round , he never set foot in north america , the journey had been made by vikings centuries earlier and he was , by all accounts , a giant ass-hole . 
  it 's like england having a national holiday to celebrate oliver cromwell . 
  third time lucky . 
  just about [ every ] ( http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/fiscal-impact-immigration-uk ) source or paper on the matter says the same thing . 
  migration as a whole has a minuscule impact on a countries economy . 
  eea migrants have a positive effect and non eea migrants are a drain . 
   dustmann and fratini ( 2013 ) estimated the fiscal impact of eea and non-eea migrants during the 1995-2011 period . 
  their results suggest that during this period the total fiscal impact of eea migrants in the uk was close to gbp + 8.8 billion per year ( an average of close to gbp + 0.6 billion per year ) . 
  the total fiscal impact of non-eea migrants for this period was estimated at gbp -104 ( an average of close to gbp -6.5 billion per year ) . 
  look at all the integration that happens in [ america ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/race_and_ethnicity_new_york_city.png ) !, 
  / s just about every [ city ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=new+york+city+race+demographics&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=i54aibh2zhvmvm%253a%253bv9mgyy_e1tkq9m%253bhttps%25253a%25252f%25252fen.wikipedia.org%25252fwiki%25252fdemographics_of_new_york_city&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=i54aibh2zhvmvm%253a%252cv9mgyy_e1tkq9m%252c_&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=920&amp;usg=__s5b-so1-nfbwsiyayazmwzcb0iw%3d&amp;ved=0cd0qyjdqfqotclng4o7ssmgcfci8faodvucd8w&amp;ei=slevvrmlf8j5ur7pj5gp#tbm=isch&amp;q=chicago+city+race+demographics&amp;imgrc=db3gqiajbbk3pm%3a ) is heavily segregated along race lines . 
  far more segregated than [ london ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=london+city+race+demographics&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmikd7fru2wyaivgbguch3ajg-w&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=920#imgrc=gkqwdgkwx9x9_m%3a ) . 
   well , our language is n't distorted [ ... ] by billions of non-native speakers daily that 's because it 's an irrelevant language and billions of people do n't speak it . 
  persecution is not the same as getting randomly killed in a war . 
  there is no requirement to grant anyone refugee status just because their country is at war and they might get killed . 
  just looking at ww2 as an example the eastern europeans and jews would ave had valid claims for refugee status , they were persecuted and killed by government forces for their religion or nationality whereas british civilians would have had no right to claim refugee status just because they might get killed in an air raid . 
  most countries probably would offer aid to their neighbours who flee widespread conflict but there is no legal obligation to do so . 
  there is certainly no international law that requires countries to take in people who fled a war and passed across multiple safe countries before claiming asylum . 
  yes , unlike you i had actually read it . 
   `` a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . 
  as i said , persecution yes . 
  war and famine ? 
  nope , not our obligation . 
  except it is n't . 
  you 're making shit up now . 
   displaced by war and famine that accounts for several million in most years . 
  it 's not europe 's responsibility to offer everyone in the world asylum just because they might die . 
  people in shitty third world countries get killed/starve all the time . 
  we ca n't take them all in and have no legal or moral requirement to do so . 
  its all part of being a lefty . 
  for every well thought out moderately liberal idea they have 5 stupid extreme ideas that will put everyone off . 
  see the green party for a prime example . 
  name checks out . 
  there is a middle ground . 
  those who occupy it just get labelled far right anyway by the aforementioned dumb liberals . 
  using your scale a brexit is `` 7 '' points less of a fuck up . 
  which is is kinda the whole point in the phrase `` in comparison '' . 
  it means compared to something else . 
  how is that so difficult for you to understand ? 
  im not only correct in my usage of a common phrase , you backed my up by rating trumps election as over three times more of a fuck up than the brexit . 
  suddenly the brexit result does n't seem so stupid . 
  ... in comparison at least . 
   sorry scottish , n. irish , and welsh people of reddit , you 're now english because the english say so . 
  when i was a kid there were no scottish/welsh devolved governments and they were busy murdering each other in n.ireland . 
  england has always been in charge , its a democracy and they have the most votes . 
  its only very recently we 've been able to have a voice in running our own countries at all . 
  no i ridiculed smug assholes who dismiss all media outlets , polls , experts and the fact every bit of evidence contradicts them and then turn round and use the muh `` biased media '' argument . 
  its not like im treating a mail piece as gospel . 
  its widely accepted by virtually everyone that labour are expected to get spanked next ge . 
  even the most biased pro corbyn pieces will talk about his challenge to unite the party and win over labour voters just to put up a fight at the next ge . 
  so go shit stir somewhere else . 
  that 's not what i claimed at all , so go look elsewhere for your argument . 
  im claiming that type of idiotic comment is what someone who gets all their news from social media says . 
  only tin foil hat conspirators dismiss all press . 
  if i was the lib dems id campaign on the promise of ignoring the referendum and staying in europe . 
  probably the only way they can claw back a significant amount of votes next election . 
  saying that , there 's a good chance i might end up throwing my vote away on a lib dem protest vote . 
  i wo n't vote labour while corbyn leads and voting for the tories is out of the question . 
  because the overwhelming majority of the electorate is centrist .
