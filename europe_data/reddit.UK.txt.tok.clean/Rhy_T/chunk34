  how convenient , germany wants something and suddenly the current system is `` unconstitutional '' . 
   complete disregard for the people fleeing not that old meme , `` fleeing '' . 
  [ anything .

  ] ( http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/08/30/11/refugees-welcome-dresden.jpg ) [ say ] ( http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_36/1208091/150906-syrian_migrant_merkel-0639_73e3ae593224f21b299f4b29890109d9.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg ), 
   what it did was trying to apply our asylum law by suspending it . 
   while eastern europe ... 
  wanted to apply border controls and process people before allowing them to wander around willy nilly . 
  they wanted what we 're all doing now , and were called right wing , xenophobic bigots by the hypocritical germans . 
  sure thing , it 's just coincidence they passed through perfectly fine countries like austria , in droves , to get to germany . 
  who tried to prevent the fences going up ? 
  who prevented anyone from doing anything unless a quota deal was part of the package ? 
  who encouraged people to make the journey over ? 
  and finally who suspended dublin . 
  germany . 
   there are treaties that tell the eu how to react to refugees which did n't require them to accept any `` quotas '' , or people entering from safe neighbouring countries and germany suspended them anyway . 
   this `` you invited them '' bullshit . 
  its well known germany not only encouraged them but suspended dublin allowing them to reach germany and pressured other countries to accept them . 
  all because they wanted more migrants for the workforce . 
   so the difference between germany and eastern europe is eastern europe did what 's best for themselves and europe as a whole . 
  germany did what 's best for itself and tried to dick everybody else over , as usual . 
  funny how the uk turned out to be right all along . 
  deny them entry and take refugees directly from camps in neighbouring countries . 
  thanks to germany we have hundreds of thousands present , plenty still making the journey and we got in bed with and legitimised erdogan . 
  how did the uk , or even poland , `` backstab '' anyone during the migrant crisis ? 
   backstabbing pronunciation : / \u02c8bak\u02ccstabing /  the action or practice of criticizing someone in a treacherous manner while feigning friendship . 
  to me it would seem eastern europe and the uk were the ones getting backstabbed . 
   both countries complain endlessly , are unwilling to cooperate and cherrypick the best parts of eu while germans pay for it . 
  amusing considering germany bullied everyone into accepting quotas , insulted and denigrated everyone who resisted then flipflopped anyway . 
  maybe the uk poland should be the ones making all the decisions . 
  do n't even get me started on `` cherrypicking '' considering germany benefited financially from the greek crisis , wanted immigrant labour so forced quotas on europe and the massive gains germany gets from the euro at the expense of weaker countries . 
  got a `` brexit '' and `` bremain '' leaflet through this morning . 
  brexit one is simply ridiculous scaremongering while the remain one highlights everything the eu has contributed funds to in the local area . 
  that poll of polls would probably be a lot more accurate if they did n't include orb . 
  just look at them . 
  52-40 , 51-41 , 58 ( * fifty fucking eight !, 
  * ) to 38 on may the 22nd . 
  aside from a pair of comres polls no-one else goes above 50 % for stay/leave yet those clowns do it every poll . 
  they seem to consistently be 10 % minimum off everyone else . 
  no surprise id never heard of them before today . 
  i just conducted a poll of my house and its remain 100 % . 
  only reputable polling companies mean shit , these guys are [ nobodies ] ( http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/ ) and their polls are all over the place . 
  according to the same company remain had a 12 point lead 5 [ days ago ] ( http://www.opinion.co.uk/article.php?s=daily-telegraph-poll-2nd-5th-june ) . 
  when `` adjusted for turnout '' it ended up as a 1 % lead . 
  now leave are allegedly 10 % ahead ? 
  what a crock of shit . 
  show me a yougov or ipsos mori poll saying the same thing and i might believe it . 
  most of which have wildly swung by 5-7 % from one week to the next . 
  a reputable , worthwhile source they aint . 
  never heard of that polling company . 
  looking at their [ wesbsite ] ( http://www.opinion.co.uk/intelligence.php ) they 've only ever done a handful of polls for the independent and telegraph . 
   it is so widespread in the lesson material i have seen that i just assumed everyone knew about it . 
  well you know what they say about assumptions . 
  thanks to yougov you , and a lot of certain phone polling companies , are now aware of the obvious biases in phone polling . 
  biases it took an internet polling company to uncover . 
  yougov knows it has inherent biases and they weigh their sampling very carefully . 
  hence being incredibly accurate on things like the american election , scottish referendum , french presidential election etc. 
  a lot of phone polling companies have just been blundering around * assuming * they were representative when they really were n't . 
  you can hardly claim phone polls are `` more precise '' when they have something like 80 % + non response rate and a number inherent biases . 
  what matters most is how accurately they adjust the raw data to be representative and there 's no reason at all an internet poll should be less accurate than face to face or phone . 
  never heard of them and the fact the only case study they have is some obscure state poll about `` sunday hunting '' shows this is a pretty worthless source . 
  on one hand yougov , internationally renowned polling company . 
  on the other `` responsive management '' who 's website looks like [ this ] ( http://www.responsivemanagement.com/ ) . 
   anyone with the slightest insight into polling should know that online data is significantly less precise than other types of polling like face-to-face interviews or even phone interviews [ according ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/23/commentary-what-explains-difference-between-phone-/ ) to [ yougov ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/05/20/revealed-evidence-greater-skews-phone-polls/ ) online tends to be pretty representative , or at least it 's biases are well known . 
  it 's phone polling 's hidden biases and pushing for opinions of people who ar n't sure that leads to huge embarrassments like the 2015 ge . 
   any brit reading this , have your stag party at home the current arrangement is much better . 
  places that set themselves up as tourist destinations get the money they crave , the louts can get drunk cheaply and enjoy better weather and we have less people throwing up in city centres on the weekend . 
  everyone 's a winner . 
  so do french wine tasters [ apparently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judgment_of_paris_%28wine%29 ) . 
   so still leaving eu if that 's the outcome of the referendum if its a particularly low turnout and/or `` out '' wins by only a few % i fully expect parliament to ignore the result . 
  it 's not a strong enough mandate for the huge change involved and , as i said , the referendum is not legally binding . 
   the referendum result is not legally binding - parliament still has to pass the laws that will get britain out of the 28 nation bloc , starting with the repeal of the 1972 european communities act . 
   the withdrawal agreement would also have to be ratified by parliament - the house of lords and/or the commons could vote against ratification , according to a house of commons library report . 
   it adds : `` if the commons resolves against ratification , the treaty can still be ratified if the government lays a statement explaining why the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the house of commons does not resolve against ratification a second time within 21 days ( this process can be repeated ad infinitum ) . '', 
   in practice , conservative mps who voted to remain in the eu would be whipped to vote with the government . 
  any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election . 
   one scenario that could see the referendum result overturned , is if mps forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep britain in the eu , got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one .

  do n't see how this is a surprise really . 
  referendums are not legally binding and a huge majority of parties/mp 's are for staying in the eu . 
  i quite like the polish . 
  maybe it 's living in an area with a lot of poverty , but i find them to be a lot better than most people . 
   last thread got deleted , so will this one good , it 's the third or fourth time ive seen this in 24 hours and its old news to begin with . 
  germany and just enough poor countries to make german exports competitive enough . 
  personally i think anyone who uses social media to argue or post `` oh so deep opinions '' should be locked up and the key thrown away . 
  save that stuff for places like here  is n't everyone tired of the whole social media thing yet ? 
  no , i do n't care what harry potter character you are or what your `` iq '' is . 
  just because you think cancer sucks and nurses are awesome does n't mean you have to post a shitty chain image ... and it turns out i really do n't want to hear what my cousins opinion is about anything . 
  it got old fast for me . 
  i should care i guess , censorship and all that , but im just to apathetic when it comes too people who still use social media . 
  not just wars there are fools in this thread who are actually arguing that shit like droughts , hunger and famine should count as well . 
  they seem to think europe is obligated to give most of the planet a better standard of living . 
  i never claimed it was a part of the eu , i said this type of turnaround is typical of how the eu operates . 
  we have one institution based on europe that ignores the national sovereignty of a country to force a decision and a second court system , that 's supposed to follow the case law of the echr , now ignoring it 's rulings and claiming the opposite can be done . 
  that mean old uk ca n't ban someone wearing a cross !, 
  that 's religious discrimination !, 
  but it 's totes cool for france/belgium to ban headscarf 's / niqabs . 
  the second example i gave was of a school banning a headscarf and it being upheld . 
  in fact our courts have upheld pretty much everything when it comes to this issue . 
  only in the one case did a ruling go against the employer and that was the rather meaningless echr .
