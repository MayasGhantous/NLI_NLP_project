  six times our national courts sided with her employer before it reached that stage . 
   this is in fact why employers have routinely lost in national courts except that woman lost every case/appeal in the national courts and companies/schools can and have banned people from wearing religious clothing for non health and safety grounds . 
  [ fired for wearing a niqab in 2007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azmi_v_kirklees_metropolitan_bc ) [ school banned jilb\u0101b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r_v_headteacher_and_governors_of_denbigh_high_school,_ex_p_begum ) as long as the company has a valid reason for doing so they are free to ban religious clothing , according to * our * national courts that is . 
  echr seems to think otherwise . 
   and why should this be at the discretion of your employer because what you wear at work and how you should present yourself is entirely upto the employer . 
  just because certain sweaty neckbeards can turn upto work in yesterdays jeans and t-shirt does n't mean it 's the norm . 
  ive never had a job that did n't have some kind of dress code or policy on jewelry . 
  whether you work as a manager in a large business or man a production line for minimum wage , the employer decides what you should and should n't wear . 
   as dresscodes at least apply to everybody and thus do n't face the discriminatory issues that come up regarding religious symbols if some people are allowed to wear different items based solely on religious belief it is discriminatory and does not `` apply to everyone '' . 
  i , as a person of no religion , would n't have been allowed to wear a necklace openly . 
  ba had a dresscode that stated no visible necklaces . 
  simply wearing it under her uniform was n't good enough for one woman . 
  neither would she compromise and wear a lapel pin . 
  she wanted to rub her faith in other peoples face , and i quote :  [ `` it is important to wear it to express my faith so that other people will know that jesus loves them . 
  '' ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/6166746.stm ) whether religious symbols are openly on display at a workplace should be at the discretion of the employer . 
   why the fuck are employers supposed to be able to dictate what the employees wear ? 
  not that familiar with the whole `` employment '' thing are you . 
  lpt a lot of jobs have set uniforms or dress code employees must meet . 
   and it seems reasonable for her to be able to use the cross . 
  id rather there was no religious symbols at all and it 's * reasonable * that a private company should be able to have such a dress code . 
  [ amusingly ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21025710 ) a woman was prevented from wearing a cross because of an employee dress code , the british courts upheld the employers decision ... then the court of human rights claimed her :  `` rights under article 9 of the european convention on human rights had been violated . '', 
  this turnaround seems quite typical of how dysfunctional the eu is . 
  surely you cant think this applies to the greek crisis in anyway ? 
   we have a thing called `` working tax credits '' which is designed to top up the income of low earners so they can stay in work , which has also been cut to only include people who work 24 or more hours . 
  been offered a 16-20 hours job ? 
  better reject it . 
  you 'll be worst off . 
  i think something like bi could easily work considering how bloated and useless the benefit system is and what a small fraction of the budget payment to unemployed are . 
  but people would never accept it . 
   england better put some love on wales otherwise we 're going to be feeling very lonely . 
  neither one of those is likely to ever happen . 
  sure , i remember you posting a link to a thread with half a dozen replies on stormfront about a year ago as `` proof '' . 
  have to admire their determination and tenacity . 
  pretty amazing really how they continue to brigade a 750k sub for a year . 
  4chan counts posting shit for a couple hours on tumblr as a major victory , but this ... this is pretty spectacular levels of `` brigading '' . 
  in a years time when nothing has changed are you still going to say its being `` brigaded '' ? 
  how about 2 years ? 
  eventually you 'll accept it 's not brigading , its what the sub is like now . 
  since when have the greens had a credible solution to anything ? 
  they even manage to take a good idea like `` we should have more renewable energy '' and turn it into something stupid by insisting on phasing out all fossil fuels/nuclear energy in 10 years . 
  you 've been peddling that dumb excuse for a year now . 
  face it , your opinions do not reflect what the majority think anymore and they never did outside the echochamber this place used to be . 
  * edit looks like a quite a few people just ca n't accept the sub has gone from 200k to over 750k subs in two years . 
  this place is n't being brigaded , your opinions are just unpopular to the average european . 
   greece was able to finance it 's own expenditure until interest rates spiraled out of control no they were n't , that 's why thy were borrowing money and hiding the debt for decades . 
   the entire problem was financing it 's debt , not it 's other expenditure . 
  sure . 
  the massive , bloated public spending , culture of tax evasion and reckless borrowing had nothing to do with it . 
  it was the evil ecb/imf for bailing greece out and expecting them to cut spending to lower than expenditure . 
   but there 's some more obscure ones about literature i would n't call picking out a jane austin novel obscure . 
  ive never read them or even watched any films/series based on them and it was obvious . 
  92 % , i would expect anyone serious about citizenship to be able to pass that . 
  i can understand if they did n't know something like who gilbert and sullivan were , but i would expect them to get 3/4 's easily . 
   world famous and distinguished economist because you and i disagree with him is a bit of a stretch , do n't you think ? 
  no , i do n't . 
  hence the only thing ever mentioned about him was his `` game theory '' bullshit or calling him a `` rockstar '' because he drives a motorbike . 
  there was nothing else worthwhile to mention . 
  the man had no serious academic credentials , had achieved nothing and was completely unknown . 
  his entire career up until he got involved in politics can be summed up by saying `` he was a professor for a while then worked at steam for a bit , researching made up currency '' there are thousands of economists who have done far more and many more `` academics '' . 
  the only reason anyone knows his name is because of a political appointment , one he fucked up spectacularly . 
   substantially less harsh demands for austerity . 
  ignoring the fact that greece was already given super low interest rates , that would mean greece would need more money to avoid making cuts . 
  where was this money going to come from ? 
  the ez/imf could n't have given greece money for that . 
  they had to break their rules just to avoid greece defaulting on debts already owed , no private banks or institutions were going to lend greece money . 
  just where in your naive fantasy does greece get the billions needed to `` lessen austerity '' ? 
  there was n't anywhere . 
  hence austerity was never `` a choice '' , it was the only option . 
  that or defaulting/bankrupcy which they were welcome to choose . 
  not only was he not one of the `` worlds most distinguished academics '' but he and syrzia were idiots for even thinking `` anti-austerity '' was an option . 
  greece had more money going out than coming in . 
  nobody was willing to lend money to them , the ez and the imf had to break their own rules just to keep them afloat . 
  greece had a choice between austerity and super fast austerity . 
  wasting months , pissing everyone off and driving greece 's economy further into the shitter trying to get some fantasy `` anti austerity '' deal was beyond dumb . 
  greece was in austerity for decades lol ? 
  do you even know what austerity is ? 
  loaning billions you cant repay and pissing money away wastefully is not austerity , its the opposite of austerity . 
  unlike you i did follow events . 
  considering greece had to go through austerity anyway and debt restructuring still only a possibility in two years time , he 's still a clueless idiot . 
  the possibility of future write downs or restructuring does not change the amateurish , naive and fucking idiotic way he blundered around during the bailout . 
  greece had a choice between austerity and bankruptcy . 
  austerity won , `` anti-austerity '' was never an option . 
   however , he suggested that the middle east would not be better off today were saddam hussein still in power . 
  pretty much sums up the middle east . 
  damned if you do , damned if you do n't . 
  either way latte sipping college liberals get to protest about their government . 
  lots of people seem to have identified as christian as a default kind of answer for ages without really practising the religion or even in believing it . 
  wonder if they 've given up the pretence or if there was a difference in methodology . 
  i could see , for example , a lot more people identifying as `` not having a religion '' than maybe identifying as an atheist/agnostic . 
  20 years ago i would have said im an atheist . 
  now , because of negative stereotypes , id probably just say i do n't have a religion . 
  lol that 's a hell of a jump though , practically doubled in 5 years . 
  * edit  in contrast , 59.5 % of people in wales say they have no religion . 
  no surprise . 
   humanitarian organisations have raised concerns about `` diabolical '' conditions in the calais camp since the start of the refugee crisis , with raw sewage mixing with litter and thick mud in the rain reminds me of the saying `` wish in one hand , shit in the other , see which one fills up faster '' . 
   of the 6,000 migrants estimated to be living in the jungle and jules ferry centre , the largest group were found to be from sudan , at around a third , followed by afghanistan , iraq , iran , syria , eritrea and pakistan . 
   around 95 per cent of respondents were men and the mean age was 25 , with half of those questioned having completed secondary or further education . 
  what we already knew , they are n't syrian refugees and are all working age males . 
  nope , immigration is always one of the big topics in the uk . 
  long before this crisis it was one of the top 5 or so important issues to people and it will continue to be for a long time .
