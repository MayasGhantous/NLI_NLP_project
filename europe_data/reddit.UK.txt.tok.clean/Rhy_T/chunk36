  also political parties exist so people can have a choice in what policies etc are enforced . 
  by not offering people a choice on the the biggest they are failing in their core duty and people will vote for fringe parties . 
   also , you 're british and you say that homelessness and free access to quality education are not issues in your country ? 
  yup its a complete non issue . 
  do n't know what its like in whatever shithole you live in but in the uk every student has the right to a free education . 
  it 's part of being a modern western democracy . 
  homelessness is 0 . 
  [ 63 in a thousand for `` statutory homeless '' ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/509763/statutory_homelessness_statistical_release_october_to_december_2015.pdf ) which includes people in accommodation and there 's only something like [ 3k people ] ( http://www.homeless.org.uk/facts/homelessness-in-numbers/rough-sleeping/rough-sleeping-explore-data ) rough sleeping in a country of 64 million . 
  most of which are in london . 
  so no , neither homelessness or that drivel about equality in education are issues in the uk . 
  the nhs/immigration/unemployment / economy are . 
  probably because overall crime reduction rates would not in the least disprove the fact that immigrants cause more crimes * a country of only 5-10 % immigrants could still see a reduction in overall crime even if the amount caused by immigrants increased over the same period . 
  * assuming immigrants do cause more crimes to begin with . 
  its people like you that cause the rise of the so called `` right wing '' . 
  i told you that almost 50 % see immigration as the main concern and your response was `` well , youth unemployment is probably a more important issue '' you might think that , most people in the uk would disagree with you . 
  immigration is what people are concerned about and if you ignore those concerns people are going to vote for a party that ** will ** address them . 
  as we 've seen in recent elections . 
  oh and fyi , equal opportunity education and homelessness are not issues . 
   well , what do we do then , if migration is actually not a central issue except it is the [ biggest issue ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3691/economist-ipsos-mori-january-2016-issues-index.aspx ) in the uk , by a clear margin and i would expect it to be a the same across much of europe . 
  it was a pretty big , central issue in germany 's recent elections and is playing a huge part in austria 's . 
  i do n't even know what planet you live on if you think immigration and refugees is not a huge issue right now across europe . 
  you must be a fool to think otherwise . 
  our right wing is hardly even right wing . 
  calling tories right wing is just as silly as calling labour left wing , they are both central parties . 
  even ukip is not exactly far out there on the right , they 've toned down a lot of their rhetoric to be more palatable . 
  europe is not descending into the `` right wing '' , a couple parties are gaining protest votes because the others wo n't tackle the issue of immigration . 
  if the flow of refugees was stopped tomorrow the `` right wing revival '' would vanish as quickly as it appeared . 
   what if the perception of migration as the biggest issue is flawed then sticking your fingers in your ears and pretending the concerns are n't valid or do n't exist is really fucking stupid . 
  it 'll just drive people to vote for the ones who do seem to take the issue seriously . 
  like coal and steel you mean ? 
   i still disagree with the majority right-wingers say . 
  most people probably do . 
  but when immigration is the biggest concern and the right wingers are the only ones looking to reduce it they are going to gain votes . 
  there 's been zero evidence found of any attempt to make nuclear weapons , none at all . 
  not a single piece in the 24 years people have been calming they are being made . 
  you know what countries * there is * plenty of evidence of them managing to acquire nukes ? 
  our so called allies , saudia arabia and israel . 
  iran is a bogey man used to scare plebs . 
  when was the last time they did something `` evil '' like invading a neighbour or committing genocide/ethnic cleansing . 
   the west could not afford to let iran have nuclear weapons oh fuck off with that shit . 
  ive been hearing `` iran are close to nuclear weapons '' for over [ 20 years ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/world/iran-may-be-able-build-atomic-bomb-5-years-us-israeli-officials-fear.html?pagewanted=all ) now . 
  it 's something a certain country and it 's ally like to peddle out to scare fools with . 
   so as long as iran is the west 's main enemy i mean , iran enjoys a good `` death to the west '' chant as much as anyone else but when push comes to shove they 've behaved far better than our so called `` allies '' in that region . 
   sure , but that \u00b4 s mostly because everything they propose is just in self interest and doesn \u00b4 t really benefit the eu as whole as i see it unlike germany of course . 
  it 's not like germany would ever force through stuff that benefits itself over the rest of europe . 
  as far as im concerned if everyone else would rather let germany dictate everything instead of reaching out to the uk then do n't bitch about being forced to accept a quota . 
  it was your choice . 
   because within the eu they opted out of everything and play almost no roll in to co-create laws and shape the eu . 
  the uk lacks backing from other nations and has zero need for it when they can just opt out of a lot of things or ignore them anyway , see the whole migrant quota farce . 
   it 's pretty obvious it 's not going to happen . 
  people are scared of ~ ~ change ~ ~ uncertainty . 
  ftfy, 
  as soon as immigrants began arriving germans began burning down shelters . 
  [ germany struggles with surge in arson attacks against refugees ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-asylum-arson-iduskcn0pv1qs20150721 ) but no , germany is the open and tolerant society . 
  its those pesky eastern europeans who are the right wing racists . 
  id be smug too if i was the ruling party and corbyn represented the only opposition i was going to face at the next election . 
   farmers tore up banana trees are replanted ones that got them more money per banana using the new classification ... and now most of the worlds banana plantations are in trouble as all these trees are vulnerable to a single strain of fungus . 
  [ except none of that actually happened . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bananas-extinction-cavendish-panama-disease_us_565eb2d3e4b08e945fed6712 ) the gros michel banana was favoured because it tasted better , was bigger and was better for transporting . 
  when that was nearly wiped out by a fungus farmers switched to the cavendish because it was resistant to that fungus ... and now * that * strain is facing disaster because of the same evolved fungus . 
  are mono-crops a bad idea ? 
  yeah , but your example has nothing to do with class 1 specifications and the eu did n't even exist when the problem with bananas started . 
  america land of the free * & nbsp ; ^ * terms ^ and ^ conditions ^ apply, 
  yes , its not hard to have low costs when you employ vast amounts of cheap immigrants , enjoy monopoly status and can buy politicians . 
  americans do n't understand the meaning of competition , just look how fucked up the whole isp thing is . 
  each company having a regional monopoly and people pay for shitty and expensive internet because of `` muh free market ! '', 
   from more efficient american companies lol , good one . 
  technically . 
  which was kinda the point i was making . 
  `` sovereign default '' does n't exactly roll of the tongue, 
  no , what i said is it 's working out really well for one country . 
  source on how much the euro is benefiting austria ? 
  i think we both know the amount austria allegedly benefits will be dwarfed by a certain other country . 
  [ swing and a miss . 
  ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=who+the+euro+benefits+most ), 
   the common currency really was a spectacularly bad idea . 
  oh i do n't know , i think it 's working out really well for one country . 
  no prizes for guessing which one . 
  it 's quite irrelevant really . 
  in a national `` default/bankruptcy '' nothing happens with the debt unless the creditors decide it does , the argentina example just reinforces what we already knew . 
  if a country is declared bankrupt the debt does n't go away , [ it remains .

  shockingly rhod gilbert claims to be a comedian as well . 
  i do n't see it myself , but technically we have 2 . 
  its still comprised of 4 countries each with its unique culture . 
  anything that claims to show differences etc between european countries and treats the uk as one entity will always get a downvote from me . 
  as you pointed out , what it 's really showing then is the data for england and ignoring the huge differences that can be between countries in the uk . 
  if it 's a post comparing `` x '' things between european countries and it treats the uk as one country it 's an automatic downvote from me . 
  in this case i 'll deign to give you an upvote for having england/scotland/wales / ireland represented . 
  ah yes , that bastion of quality reporting south africa 's `` business day live '' . 
  you should quit trying so hard , you 're coming across as desperate . 
  sure thing , it 's not that the majority of people rose up rejected the russian puppet when he turned his back on closer ties with the eu . 
  it was secretly started by undercover cia agents and the plebs of ukraine went along with it because western propaganda is too stronk !, 
  after all , the west could n't afford to lose ukraines ... ummm . . whatever they have in ukraine that the west needs . 
  until russia started annexing neighbours the west had n't give a shit about it for decades . 
  the only reason anyone cares about russia now is because russia is going full retard . 
  yes , russia annexing neighbours , shooting down civilian aircraft while all the time lying about it and constantly threatening and trying to bully eastern europe is just the west being paranoid . 
  there are no russian troops invading ukraine/georgia comrade , it 's just imperialist western propaganda .
