  shame the eu had to then go and spend the next year fucking up its way from one crisis to the next . 
  i almost feel sorry for that tosspot cameron . 
  he really did n't want to see britain leaving the eu and its a real possibility now . 
  do n't think portugal was ever on par with the big european players in terms of military . 
  they were the guys to beat when it came to trade , exploration and colonizing though . 
  ** downvotes for pointing out the obvious . 
  funny how the peaceful anti-immigration protesters are `` far right '' and the violent counter protesters are merely `` left wing '' . 
  im sure i can hazard a guess as to the political leaning of those violently protesting at the italy/austria border too . 
  yeah an honorary fellow like i said . 
  for his contribution as a tv personality , like i also said . 
  still waiting for you to tell me what his contribution to science has been other than being host of a popular wildlife show . 
  well im not waiting really , i know no such thing exists . 
  but its amusing as hell watching you clutch at the same straw repeatedly . 
  that 's what a bailout is . 
  you owe money you ca n't pay and your economy is on the brink of collapse , someone bails you out by giving you the money to pay your debt and keep the creditors at bay for a while . 
  of course most of it made it 's way to banks and financial institutions , they are the ones greece owed money too . 
  what did you think a bailout was ? 
  the scientific community would agree with me . 
  its a pretty straightforward thing and all the evidence is on my side . 
  you 've still yet to name a single thing he 's researched/discovered/published because it does n't exist . 
  attenborough is a tv presenter . 
  not a scientist . 
  his shows helped create a lot of interest in the natural sciences and that 's why he 's a honorary member of a lot of things and has a lot of honorary qualifications . 
  just because your physics teacher might have a degree in physics and has a job vaguely relating to it does n't make him a scientist . 
  he 's still a teacher . 
  from the royal society of biology bio on d.a :  the most well-known ** wildlife presenter ** to have graced screens around the world , david first joined the bbc in 1952 and has continued to do so for over 60 years . 
  born in 1926 david collected fossils throughout his childhood , gaining an interest in the natural world and eventually going on to study natural sciences at clare college cambridge . 
  ** he has inspired generations ** of people and has contributed massively to highlighting the plight of species around the world . 
   one of the first programmes to hit our screens was zoo quest in 1954 , teaming up with london zoo on animal collecting expeditions . 
  the concept of a ** programme ** about catching species from the wild to put into captivity may seem archaic to us now , however at the time the programme was the most popular wildlife ** programme ** of its time . 
  with the bbc natural history the nine life series were filmed , creating a filmed encyclopaedia of animals and plants throughout the world , leading on to a ** multitude of other programmes ** pinpointing the wonders of the natural world . 
   but how has david attenborough helped to save the world ? 
  having studied zoology myself i know first-hand the inspiration he has brought to so many individuals . 
  there were few fellow students who would n't count david attenborough as one of the reasons for their interest in wildlife and for studying towards their degree , with many having the ultimate wish to go on to conserve species and habitats . 
  ** david 's programmes ** often touch on negative impacts on the environment brought about by humans . 
  in 2006 david did a documentary entitled ` can we save planet earth ? ' looking into global warming and discussing potential solutions . 
  attenborough is vocal about his views on the world 's population and what is necessary to reduce damage to the world . 
   david is an honorary fellow at the society of biology and has gained a plethora of awards and recognition . 
  he is the only human on earth to have won baftas for programmes in black and white , colour , hd and 3d !, 
  sir david ** attenborough has brought the natural world to the living rooms of millions of people and has inspired just as many . 
  ** abc.net 's summary of him :  technically , david attenborough is ** not a scientist ** , but he has contributed enormously to our knowledge of science every single mention is about him being a tv presenter . 
  if you 're going to try and carry on arguing about his status as a scientist you better put up some facts . 
  lets say russia starts building up military along the border and becoming extremely belligerent towards neighbours . 
  some countries will think its a bluff and nothing should be done to escalate it , some will think we should mobilise and deploy in a show of strength or as a preventative measure . 
  what eastern european countries think about the situation will be vastly different to what a country like portugal or the uk thinks should be done . 
  in the end bugger all will be done because the eu ca n't agree on pretty simple stuff never mind what 's always likely to be a tough and/or unpopular decision such as military intervention somewhere . 
   it 's like arguing with a climate change denier . 
  funny , those were my exact thoughts as well . 
  i ask for proof about his scientific contribution , you produce zero . 
  your entire contribution has been `` what you say ca n't be true because i feel differently '', 
  considering the eu still has n't solved the migrant issue or even the fucking greece issue it 's pretty naive of you to think they 'll be able get together and operate a military . 
  chances are extremely high that countries will never agree on how it will be funded and operated and even if it is created it 'll almost certainly never be used . 
  i was against bailing greece out last year . 
  should have just let them go bankrupt at that point . 
  bailing them out was just kicking the can down the road , it solved nothing . 
  no more bailouts , no haircuts . 
  time to let the inevitable happen . 
   a united european military even if the eu could agree on funding and staffing it what are the chances of them ever agreeing on using it ? 
  i have my doubts atm that europe could pull its head out of its ass and agree to mobilise an army even if there was evidence we were facing an invasion . 
  you get used to it . 
  they are n't , it 's entirely the case of the tories having second thoughts and flip flopping when it appears something is too unpopular . 
  labour are meaningless atm . 
  my opinion , which im perfectly entitled to have , is based on someone ive know for decades having met him several times . 
  everyone elses opinion so far has been `` but i saw him on the telly ! '', 
  oh you care , you seem to care a great deal . 
  hence you saying `` im not going to waste my time with you '' several hours and comments ago . 
  and he has had a distinguished career as a tv presenter , i wont deny it . 
  does n't make him a scientist , or less of a cunt though . 
   a substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge , he got in based on his role as a tv presenter . 
  not his advancement of science , which is none . 
  so you admit he 's done nothing personally to advance scientific knowledge and is just a tv personality who 's been given a bunch of honour stuff for being a `` national treasure '' glad you agree with me . 
  go on then . 
  list me all the research he personally has done . 
  the thesis he has put forward etc or discoveries that he made in his 70 + years as a `` scientist '' . 
  should be a pretty hefty fucking list . 
  ** edit , having done as you suggested and looked at his wiki page it seems obvious im correct . 
  the man is a tv presenter , not a scientist . 
  under `` awards and recognition ''  attenborough 's contribution to broadcasting and wildlife film-making has brought him international recognition . 
  he has been called `` the great communicator , the peerless educator '' [ 45 ] and `` the greatest broadcaster of our time . 
  '' [ 46 ] his programmes are often cited as an example of what public service broadcasting should be , even by critics of the bbc , and have influenced a generation of wildlife film-makers . 
  same kind of people who upvote crap from the guardian most likely . 
  just at the opposite end of the political spectrum . 
   you 're a fucking moron if you think people should just forget about i never said or even expected everyone to change their opinion of him , just stated my own opinion based on a friend who 's met him several times professionally . 
  as to his contribution to science , other than getting kids interested in natural science , i do n't see a lot . 
  sorry you ca n't deal with the fact people might have a different opinion to you . 
   when seemingly everyone else who met him said he 's a brilliant guy . 
  means nothing , no-one said anything bad about jimmy saville . 
  turns out he was a monster . 
  that 's what happens with `` national treasures '' no-one will dare say anything bad about them as they wo n't be believed . 
  can you imagine the flakk some joirno would get if they wrote an article titled `` i met attenborough and found him to be quite an asshole actually '' and i trust my friend 100 % when it comes to this . 
  like most people he grew up watching attenborough and loving his shows . 
  he had no axe to grind against him whatsoever . 
  yes , im sure if you ever meet him you 'll be suitably awestruck and kiss his ass too . 
  he 'll probably come across as quite a charming guy then . 
  just do n't try to have a different opinion to him , even if it is the correct one , he hates that . 
  so if i were to say trump is like a male hillary obssessed with immigration you would think i was saying `` hillary is a man and obsessed with immigration '' ? 
  the only flailing here is dumbasses who ca n't understand basic english but still try to argue anyway . 
  i can believe that . 
  no i compared person a to person b else with a condition that person b behaved like x. i never claimed clarkson behaved in a certain way , but if he * did * act like that , he 'd be just like attenbororugh . 
  my main take away from this is that redditors ca n't read or understand what hypothetical means .
