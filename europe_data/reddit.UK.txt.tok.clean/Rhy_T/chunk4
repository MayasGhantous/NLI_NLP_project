  some 70,000 came from eastern europe alone . 
  to imply that more than 4,000 syrian refugees is in some way `` too much '' is a statistical joke . 
  net immigration last year was 298,000 and we 'll be getting 30,000 + * asylum seekers * without the need to import any to begin with . 
  so you agree with me , glad you took the time and effort to argue nothing . 
  either he gets the right training for something better , which is not always possible , or he does a shitty minimum wage job . 
  absolutely nothing exceptional about his circumstances whatsoever . 
  i know dozens of people in that situation , it 's got nothing to do with him being foreign born or a refugee , or hard done by by society . 
   we 're not talking about someone without qualifications . 
  we 're talking about someone who is qualified no , he is n't qualified . 
  he might have had some training in a similar type job but he was not qualified to be a fighter pilot in finland as the guy said . 
  finland has it 's own requirements and training for that , he did n't meet them . 
  an american fighter pilot who comes over to the uk is not qualified to be a fighter pilot in the raf . 
  even if he was young enough to join he 's not even ** eligible to fucking join ** them because most armed forces wo n't even accept people of other nationalities . 
  it 's never going to be * fixed * because thinking that a non native person , who 's not qualified or even trained on that country 's equipment and who might be to old , should be allowed to be a fucking fighter pilot just because he was in his old country is stupid . 
  some are more equal than others . 
  case in point our own `` negotiations '' taking place now with the referendum looming on the horizon . 
   you 're an idiot because you somehow find this a desireable outcome . 
  it 's an obvious waste , to everyone but you . 
  i never said it was desirable . 
  in your own private little fantasy world maybe everyone can get the job they want even if they are n't qualified , but this is n't some fantasy world . 
  it 's the real world and if you do n't meet the standards for a job , you do n't get the job . 
  i think it 's absolutely ridiculous to even suggest he 's been hard done by . 
   what are you supposed to do train to do something else or get some shitty minimum wage job , like a janitor maybe . 
  what planet do you live on where you think he 's owed the job he wants ? 
  it does n't work like that . 
  not really , its a pretty basic fact of adult life . 
  im more incredulous that you think otherwise . 
  i watched as friends got masters degree 's then ended up stacking shelves in tesco , ive seen a guy come out of the army , a sergeant , and end up wiping old peoples asses as a minimum wage care worker . 
  half the time even when you are properly qualified it is n't enough . 
  you need experience , or to know someone , or to beat the other 50 applicants for that one position . 
  if you ca n't get the job you want you get the job you can . 
  that 's how it is . 
  britain 's foreign aid budget was $ 17billion last year . 
  the year before it was $ 19 billion . 
  im sure more should be done to assist turkey , but if it means britain doing it it 'd come at someone ( africa/asia 's ) expense . 
  depends how old he was , depends on what somalia 's airforce was like , depends on how long he had been out of a job . 
  depends if he 's even eligible to join the military . 
  to use the worst possible combination you ca n't expect a 40 year old guy who flew obsolete planes and had been unemployed for 10 years to become a fighter pilot in a new country . 
  every job has requirements , if you do n't meet them it 's tough luck . 
   he was a fighter pilot , but when he came to finland he did n't have the right training to fly fighters here . 
  so now he cleans floors . 
  all day for a minimum wage . 
  i see absolutely nothing wrong with that . 
  guy does n't have any relevant skills , so its either train to get them or minimum wage shitty work . 
  it 's the same for everyone . 
  * syria is too much of a hellhole to send people back !, 
  * cant bomb syria you might hit innocent people !, 
  1/6th the population of syria has fled , anyone still left there must know the risks of staying by now . 
  id be interested on a source for the 4k and how many ireland would have been asked to take under both quotas . 
  [ you tried ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/674/284/5ab.jpg ) . 
  tl : dr germany but not britain . 
  you struggle to [ deport 11k ] ( http://www.zeit.de/feature/refugees-in-germany-deportation-flights-laws ) economic migrants a year and , assuming the 50 % rejection rate stays consistent , you 're going to have 400-500k to deport this year alone . 
  and there 's no reason to think the number of applicants reaching germany wo n't be even higher next year . 
  i would have thought the uk gave you more than [ 29 million ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/458717/dfid_syria_crisis_response_summary__2015.09.04_.pdf ) tbh . 
  depends on that amount of cross border support for syria turkey also receives , if any . 
  still , while i agree more should be done to assist turkey the uk already gives the most aid , is already increasing it by 100 million and it 's not really a solution to stopping the crisis in europe . 
  i do n't actually know why i saved this ... okay i do , wales !, 
  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3000998/are-welsh-truest-brits-english-genomes-contain-german-french-dna-romans-left-no-trace.html tl : dr lot of french in english dna but not because of the normans . 
  applicants actually decreased in [ france , sweden , uk , italy and austria ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6887997/3-18062015-cp-en.pdf/4457b050-26f9-4cf1-bf27-9ffb73ff8c7b ) the first quarter of 2015 compared to the last quarter 2014 . 
  it 's also remained a pretty constant amount over the last 2 years , france and uk have had like 5-10k difference year on year while germany 's increased by 100k ( between 13-14 ) and is predicted to increase again by another 600k ( 14-15 ) no sign of any `` snowball effect '' in any country that is n't called germany . 
  the other countries do n't have an opt out on immigration because they never negotiated one . 
   maybe because germany was the only country in the world that has openly said it would accept every syrian refugee , because they are almost exclusivly war refugees and deserve asylum after our law . 
  so you agree with me then . 
  the reason germany will end up getting 10-15 times the amount of asylum seekers france does is because of actions germany took and then announced to every wannabe asylum claimant . 
   it \u00b4 s quite obvious , have you seen statements from other high ranking officials from other countries that will affect refugee lives in any positive way sweden springs to mind . 
  the * other * country with vastly more claimants than would be expected . 
  i fail to see how anything you say had any bearing on what i said . 
  he claimed its not foreseeable that anybody will become a minority in its own nation and i provided an example of one where [ it is ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21645996-one-american-six-now-hispanic-up-small-minority-two-generations-ago ) . 
   look up asylum acceptance rates why should i look up what i already know , as do most asylum seekers probably . 
  when germany said it would suspend dublin and not deport them back to country of origin i wager they became aware , when they publicly announced a blanket acceptance of all syrian refugees i bet they knew pretty quickly . 
  outside of sweden ( the next most popular asylum seeker destination btw ) do you see any other countries constantly announcing how accepting they are to the worlds media ? 
  no , because they do n't want to encourage whats happening to germany . 
  it 's not a giant leap of reasoning to suggest that a country that constantly portrays itself as immigration friendly and announces every little thing that would make claiming asylum there easier might be responsible for receiving a vastly disproportionate amount of claims . 
  i gave a good reason and provided links . 
  you cant even guess at another reason why germany is the exception , nor can you disprove my own suggestion . 
  germany is expected to get about * three times * the number of asylum seekers as hungary , greece and italy have right now * combined * and * vastly * more than any other single eu country and you go `` hurr durr it 's nothing to do with germany '' . 
   i have no idea whether or not people in iraq watched merkels christmas speech and decided to come . 
  the other guy could n't offern an explanation either . 
  so i 'll ask you . 
  if its not because of germany 's actions why are they walking along holding pictures of merkel ? 
  or german flags ? 
  and why is germany probably going to end up with as many asylum seekers as the rest of the eu combined ? 
  what possible reason could make 800k + journey to germany and france gets less than 50 ? 
  you think the [ majority ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/04/20/2b18b87c00000578-3184708-image-a-35_1438717788759.jpg ) of asylum seekers [ did n't hear ] ( http://cache4.asset-cache.net/gc/486076200-migrants-charge-their-mobile-phones-at-the-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=x7wjla88cweo9hktrlanxgxvi1mrssaye7wp5lcziqu01xqth16s8a1whjkt7ypy7wzm%2bp1xzlw5wududwdktw%3d%3d ) about junkcers quota proposal within a [ couple hours ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/04/20/2b1851e500000578-3184708-image-a-31_1438717773915.jpg ) of it happening ? 
  they are not ignorant of what goes on in the media . 
  non hispanic whites in america ? 
  i actually had to prove this to someone the other day so luckily i have a handy list of links showing germany encouraged asylum seekers . 
   german government [ relaxed ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-cabinet-bill-eases-rules-for-asylum-seekers/a-18028279 ) rules on asylum seekers . 
   or the german president [ welcoming ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30599339 ) immigrants in his christmas speech . 
   or merkel urging germans to [ welcome ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/30/merkel-germany-refugees_n_6398070.html ) refugees . 
   or when the [ interior minister and bundestag vice president ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20140923/germany-can-handle-more-refugees ) publicly stated germany can handle more and chided the rest of europe for not doing enough . 
   yeah , germany has done nothing to encourage more immigrants to come over . 
  it 's [ sheer ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/0,,18694697_303,00.jpg ) coincidence [ they ] ( http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/main_image_article_page/public/main-images/germany_afp.jpg ) hold up pictures of [ merkel ] ( http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/55ec46919dd7cc18008b8804-667-501/merkel-says-germany-can-cope-with-refugees-without-raising-taxes-2015-9.jpg ) . 
  i read in one of the [ bbc stories ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34193568 ) earlier the 160k quota plan represented about 60 % of all the asylum seekers in greece/italy/hungary ** combined ** . 
  germany is [ already saying ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/08/us-europe-migrants-germany-refugees-iduskcn0r80v320150908 ) the 800k figure they previously expected was too low . 
  germany is the reason so many are coming over yet germany is the one telling everyone what they should do . 
  this story sprung to mind . 
  [ the sikhs who saved parmesan ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33149580 ) tldr : sikhs arrive , save the industry then integrate so well their kids want to go off to fancy universities and big cities just like what happened with the locals kids . 
  leading to the industry being in trouble again . 
  so when does [ sensiswag ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/senseiswag ) get his ban for constant personal attacks and insults that add nothing to the discussion ?
