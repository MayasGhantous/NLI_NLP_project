  he 's been doing nothing but that constantly for weeks now . 
  it 's a joke that he 's still allowed to get away with it . 
  [ cheeky banter ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article10375375.ece/alternates/w620/farage-no.jpg ) with the lads . 
  yeah stormfront has been brigading the sub constantly for 2 months and the proof is one post made a year ago . 
  be serious . 
  we have an opt out . 
  we can * choose * to participate or not . 
  surely you 'd know that . 
  cool strawman . 
  none of the people in the examples i gave said anything that could be construed as racist or `` nazi '' . 
  if someone does say something outright racist or xenophobic then by all means call them out on it . 
  sensiswag uses it on everyone that has a differing opinion to himself . 
  pff 4 times is nothing !, 
   during its history , british forces or forces with a british mandate have invaded , had some control over or fought conflicts in 171 of the world 's 193 countries that are currently un member states , or nine out of ten of all countries ( or 89 % of un nations ) . 
  [ 1 ] we must have gone to war with the french a dozen times at least . 
  probably allied with them to war against others just as often . 
  destroying each other navies is just a bit of cheeky banter . 
  my first thought was it does n't seem like the dm 's usual mo to stand up for people of the jewish faith . 
  unless the attackers happen to be muslim , then it would have `` daily mail '' story written all over it . 
  well , whaddya [ know ] ( http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/84878-150907-dutch-couple-holocaust-survivors-brutally-beaten ) . 
   two men in their 40s or 50s , who the couple said had a middle eastern appearance but spoke fluent dutch , presented themselves as police officers so the couple would buzz them into their apartment building . 
  what good is `` strengthening frontex '' when , if we catch someone in the med trying to enter the eu illegally , we bring them over ? 
  legal immigration , quotas , right to work , common asylum policy , dublin review ... 
  nothing at all that will have a reduction in immigrant arrival numbers . 
  if anything it 'll * increase * them . 
  when does he discuss stuff that 'll lead to a reduction in people floating across on boats or did i blink and miss it ? 
  also id love to be the person to explain to germany that under the new quota system they need to accept tens of thousands more immigrants than they do already . 
  1 million applicants when ? 
  im sure he would love the ability to shout opponents to death . 
  would have made junckers quota proposal today in front of the eu parliament a lot more interesting . 
  you know what a nazi is do n't you ? 
  you know the word does n't apply to someone just because they call a mass of people arriving in europe an `` invasion '' right ? 
  right ? 
  it might not be tolerant enough for your ridiculous liberal sensibilities but it 's not an indication of someone being a nazi , or even racist . 
   skyrim has a moot and a high king and both were for the empire following the death of the previous high king the moot was unable to agree on a new high king . 
  the fact elisif failed to gain support of the moot and has to be supported militarily by outsiders shows they can not claim to be valid rulers of skyrim either . 
  ive actually been playing it again the last week and sided with the nords in my first but imperial in my second playthrough . 
  i suppose the best overall result in terms of what 's right would be to side with the imperials and crush the stormcloaks quickly , beat the aldmeri dominion as a unified force and then have a rebellion . 
  ive yet to see anyone calling for the ethnic cleansing of asylum seekers . 
  what i see is people saying non racist stuff you happen to disagree with and you calling them a nazi . 
  you are a pathetic excuse for a poster . 
  when your defence of someone boils down to `` she probably does n't get much practice kicking people '' you should just give up . 
  i missed the part where a concerned citizen restrained someone and held them until the authorities could deal with them , all i saw was some woman viciously kick a man carrying a child as he passed her . 
   refugees greeted in germany with a wave of solidarity and [ arson ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3225343/refugee-shelters-targeted-arson-attacks-two-suspicious-fires-migrant-homes-germany-force-people-flee.html ) . 
  but * mainly * solidarity i suppose ... 
  good , was quite a dick move thing to do . 
  the guy was carrying , and landed on , a small child . 
  she 's a private citizen , not a member of the police/army/borderagengy . 
  she has no right to get involved . 
  france is not a war zone . 
  if they faced persecution and death in france because of their ethnicity or beliefs then no , we should accept them as refugees . 
   or because you hate immigrants no matter where they come from ? 
  legal immigrants who entered the country via proper channels no , i do n't have any issue with them . 
  we had over [ 600k enter the uk ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/february-2015/sty-net-migration.html ) that way in 2014 . 
  illegal ones who sneak in on the backs of trucks should be kicked out and prevented from ever being successful . 
  calling someone you disagree with a nazi is not an insult now ? 
  you must be one of * them * . 
  did n't you hear ? 
  it 's actually okay to constantly insult people , it just has to be [ the right ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k4kdz/denmark_sends_refugees_back_to_germany/cuuum1p ) insult . 
  if all your doing is offering personal attacks you should be banned then . 
  7/9 of your posts today were you just insulting people . 
  but we all know your best french buddy would probably be the mod that looks into the complaints against you . 
  here 's how many time you 've played the racism card today .

  as a country we 're quite [ fond ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am4milykg9s ) of it , [ not just ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/watch-moment-awe-inspired-tv-commentators-9464855 ) at rugby matches anymore . 
  no , cmon then einstein explain [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6887997/3-18062015-cp-en.pdf/4457b050-26f9-4cf1-bf27-9ffb73ff8c7b ) . 
   these member states show different recent trends : compared with the previous quarter , the number of first time asylum applicants in the first quarter 2015 jumped in germany ( +32 % ) and hungary ( +17 % ) , while it fell significantly in sweden ( -41 % ) and italy ( -28 % ) , and decreased more moderately in the united kingdom ( -10 % ) , austria ( -8 % ) and france ( -5 % ) explain how everyone else is getting less claims , or borderline changes , but germany has seen huge and constant increases . 
  give me a reason why germany is the exception . 
  i gave you one and backed it up with links , you 're just all mouth . 
  most countries accept refugees without making a huge public song and dance about how `` welcoming '' they are . 
  germany 's / sweden 's problems are of their own making . 
  explain to me how france , the uk , norway , portugal etc have had consistent amounts of refugees over the last few years , a couple thousand difference , but germany has gone from 120k to 800k in 2 years . 
  even as a pro eu person i can see how its going to play out unless germany gets it shit together . 
  * uk refuses quota . 
  * germany/france refuse camerons planned reforms . 
  * uk leaves the eu . 
  * rest of eu still wo n't accept quotas , eu has less funds . 
   the fact that they are welcoming to people made all these 160k people come the fact that you are bending over backwards to welcome them is why you went from 100k in 2013 to 200k in 2014 to 800k in 2015 . 
  whereas , sweden and entry countries aside , everyone else has has a consistent amount . 
  britain has had around 30k each year , portugal around 500 , france around 50k etc. 
  fine , how about when the german government [ relaxed ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-cabinet-bill-eases-rules-for-asylum-seekers/a-18028279 ) rules on asylum seekers . 
  or the german president [ welcoming ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30599339 ) immigrants in his christmas speech . 
  or merkel urging germans to [ welcome ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/30/merkel-germany-refugees_n_6398070.html ) refugees . 
  or when the [ interior minister and bundestag vice president ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20140923/germany-can-handle-more-refugees ) publicly stated germany can handle more and chided the rest of europe for not doing enough . 
  yeah , germany has done nothing to encourage more immigrants to come over . 
  it 's [ sheer ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/0,,18694697_303,00.jpg ) coincidence [ they ] ( http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/main_image_article_page/public/main-images/germany_afp.jpg ) hold up pictures of [ merkel ] ( http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/55ec46919dd7cc18008b8804-667-501/merkel-says-germany-can-cope-with-refugees-without-raising-taxes-2015-9.jpg ) . 
  by [ encouraging ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/events/2014/09/18/refugees-welcome-is-more-than-a-slogan-in-germany/ ) them to make the journey for over a year ? 
  you been living under a rock or something ? 
  i think nords winning would be best for the thalmor . 
  easily . 
  the emipre is weaker and much less likely to ever break free without nord help . 
  my brother actually said to me the other day he did n't side with the nords because they were racist . 
  i pointed out that the alternative were foreign oppressors under the thumb of a bunch of elven supremacists bent on world domination . 
  personally i normally side with the nords . 
   and how much is brigading from far-right or racist subreddits trying to stir shit , because that 's not .
