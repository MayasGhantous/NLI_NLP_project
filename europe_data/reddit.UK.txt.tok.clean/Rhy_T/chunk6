  not this `` brigading '' shit again . 
  it 's been two months , just how much longer is it going to have to be before you accept it 's not brigading but the demographics have changed since becoming a default sub . 
  4 chan count it a major success posting gore images to tumblr for a couple of hours and even that whole `` gamer gate '' nonsense lost steam after a couple weeks . 
  the idea that anyone has enough clout to brigade a 455k strong geo-default sub for months is ridiculous . 
  the reason there 's a lot of immigration stories is because its one of the biggest stories in every european country right now and the reason it seems like a lot of people are opposed to the current amounts of asylum seekers is because a lot of people are . 
  so what they 're actually saying is they ca n't cope with current expected figures and they 'll be nowhere near coping if it continues to increase . 
  considering all germany has achieved is a fourfold increase in asylum seekers , even higher death toll in the mediterranean and record high attacks against migrants ... remind me why countries should follow their example ? 
  like germany is an example anyone should want to follow . 
   are you 14 ? 
  no im mocking your constant need to reply and try and argue this matter with me when it should be pretty obvious i do n't really care what your * opinion * is on this matter . 
   `` other people so petty ad hominem so i will too ! '', 
  we both know id be savaged left right and centre if i did such a thing because it would be a shitty and hypocritical thing to do . 
  cool story bro . 
  in every thread tomorrow i might tell people with a german/swedish flair their country 's response is `` laughable '' and they should do more . 
  im * sure * they wo n't even mention britains response and what a giant hypocrite im being . 
  after all , its a perfectly valid opinion . 
  germany ca n't deal with a fraction of what thier receiving . 
  does n't stop them . 
  * im by no means advocating we should be following germany 's example on this *, 
   does every post have to start with an explanation of a users thoughts on his own country 's policy before stating an opinion on someone else 's ? 
  if they are going to pass moral judgement on another country instead of expressing actual opinion then yes . 
   this is one of the most blatant ad hominem attacks i think i 've seen im not saying his opinion about accepting more would be wrong , as long as he applied the same standards to his own country and acknowledged they do even less . 
  im saying his insistence that britain 's response was `` laughable '' is deeply hypocritical given his own country 's much worst response . 
   that 's not how the law work actually [ it is ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34178998 ) . 
  * `` the attorney general had been consulted and agreed there was a `` clear legal basis '' for the strike on khan , mr cameron added . 
   is a north korean allowed to think gun crime in the us is a problem ? 
  yes , but if a north korean is thinking about criticizing the usa for its human right abuses he should just shut up . 
  you do n't get to act morally superior to another country when your own country has a much worst record on the subject . 
  i did n't vote for our center-right wing government either . 
  but considering your own country does far less in this matter maybe you should avoid criticising other countries . 
  you 've still been encouraging it at every opportunity since 2014 at least . 
  even now all you care about is `` quotas '' . 
  expect even higher deaths in the mediterranean and asylum applications next year . 
  germany and sweden encouraged this and you are the the biggest destinations for asylum seekers . 
  it 's no coincidence . 
   that was a week ago [ sept 2014 ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/events/2014/09/18/refugees-welcome-is-more-than-a-slogan-in-germany/ ) * refugees welcome ! ' is more than a slogan in germany . 
  * [ october 2014 ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-cabinet-bill-eases-rules-for-asylum-seekers/a-18028279 ) * german cabinet bill eases rules for asylum seekers .

  what is it now ? 
   labour 's ms harman called for `` independent scrutiny '' of the attack , asking : `` why did n't the attorney general authorise this specific action rather than merely ` confirming there was a legal basis for it ' ? '', 
  someone 's going to have to explain that to me . 
  do legal advisor 's normally authorise military and security operations now or is she just talking bollocks . 
   you guise first need a dead kid on a beach to at least help a little . 
  how proud . 
  that kids blood is on germany 's hands imo . 
  the number of deaths in the mediterranean is [ 30 times higher than last year ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11548995/mediterranean-migrant-crisis-hits-italy-as-eu-ministers-meet-live.html ) since germany started its `` everyone come over it 's our duty to accept you '' speeches . 
  britain accepts more asylum seekers than 22 of the 28 member states and donates by far the most aid to helping . 
  germany is not an example of what to follow . 
   processed ? 
  wow !, 
  you could n't even process half the applicants you got last year and [ successfully managed to deport ] ( http://www.zeit.de/feature/refugees-in-germany-deportation-flights-laws ) less than [ 1/5th the number rejected ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_on_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applications,_2014_%28number,_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iv.png ) and now you 're getting 4 times more ? 
  past a certain point your just being stupid . 
  germany is being stupid , hence why everyone is ignoring their plans for a quota . 
  spain and portugal have n't exactly been in favour of the quota idea and britain and denmark will use their opt outs ... and lets not kid ourselves about greece and italy , if it was n't affecting them they 'd be against it . 
  did n't take long for that latest `` quota '' plan to be shot down . 
  im sure they 'll now realize its unworkable and look for a more practical solution to reduce/stop the number of arrivals on our shores / s, 
  remind me how many denmark are taking in ? 
  oh that 's right [ < 400 ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/52b2febafc5.html ) . 
  how many will you be taking in from the quota ? 
  oh that 's right , you 'll be opting out of it . 
  glass houses and stones . 
   yeah , many other eu countries did that same thing already , but with 20,000 a year , so its nothing to write home about . 
  by `` many '' you mean [ one ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/52b2febafc5.html ) , germany . 
  * most * took in less than one thousand . 
  most eu countries do far less than britain when it comes to [ numbers of asylum seekers processed ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states,_by_age_distribution,_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) and [ money given as aid ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3222250/how-britain-given-aid-refugees-germany-netherlands-france-italy-hungary-austria-poland-combined.html ) . 
   and we will need quotas , nothing will happen without them quotas ar n't going to fly so i guess nothing is going to happen then . 
  that 's okay i guess , we have the channel protecting us . 
  i can see it now :  august 2016 - jean-claude juncker will tomorrow unveil his new plans to resolve the refugee crisis . 
  the new system entitled `` quotas this time i mean it ! '', 
  will involve countries in the eu sharing out 500k asylum seekers between them . 
  germany , who are predicted to receive 1.6 million asylum seekers this year , have called on other eu members for solidarity in this matter . 
   for example , if cameron would come out and say the uk will take 100k this year if the eu agrees to a certain common policy on immigration , that could work and give the uk an opportunity to set some rules . 
  ** or ** there could be a common response first to stop them coming over * and * then decide about fairly sharing out the burden of those already here . 
  by dicking about and insisting on quotas all germany have done is waste a year and received 4x as many asylum seekers into the bargin . 
  asylum seekers which they now want to share out in some kind of `` quota '' system . 
  [ syrian civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_civil_war ) . 
  now iraq 's and britains fault . 
  [ which ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libyan_civil_war_%282011%29 ) [ one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libyan_civil_war_%282014%e2%80%93present%29 ) ? 
  ever hear of this little thing called the [ arab spring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arab_spring ) ? 
  but no , it 's only the west that destabilises a region . 
  left to their own devices the middle east is nothing but peaceful . 
   you ca n't compare [ ... ] to a situation of civil war where nobody takes any prisoners and third parties like isis gain no popular support and get told to fuck off or lose their heads . 
  like what happened in libya you mean ? 
  where after the civil war it dissolved into full on tribal chaos , militias everywhere , and islamist militants to boot . 
  yeah , im sure things would have been much worst if the western world had intervened . 
  im also sure something like that wo n't happen in syria if/when assad loses / s, 
   without iraq isis would n't have been reality anyhow we 'll have to agree to disagree then . 
  5 years , 10 years , 15 years ... does n't matter how long he clung to power he 'd eventually be gone and there would be a huge power vacuum . 
  it 's not like he was just some guy misunderstood by the west . 
  ethnic cleansing , human rights abuse ... iraq was always going to devolve into chaos . 
  so you agree with me then . 
  either commit to long term occupation and rebuilding or sit back , no involvement , and watch them all kill each other over there . 
  we 're currently doing neither . 
  the implication that iraq would not have turned into a giant clusterfuck the second [ saddam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_saddam_hussein's_iraq ) was gone is pure wishful thinking . 
  overthrowing bad guys or ignoring them leads to the same thing , only long term investment and rebuilding can make a difference and for that you need military intervention . 
   well , isis emerged out of a group based in iraq and subsequently spread to syria . 
  i think it 's fair to say that the lawlessness and violence of the iraq war had a big impact on the destabilizing of the region ( including syria ) . 
  obama has even recognized the link between the invasion of iraq and isis . 
  only because we half assed it . 
  liberals cried `` unjust war '' everyone abandon iraq as fast as they could allowing isis to grow .
