  luckily we 're now back to `` supporting '' people and hoping the side that wins will turn out better then the previous one . 
  because * that * has a history of working . 
   ( see the iraq war ) . 
  we are still facing the consequences of that decision to this day . 
  iraqis make up about [ 3 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states,_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) of `` refugees '' so not really . 
  if anything what your implying is that * we should * send troops into syria . 
  i just think , like most stories on the subject , its entirely made up of spin to elicit feel good factor . 
  she does n't rule out there being an upper limit at all and the figure she does quite is pretty meaningless . 
  germany - deal !, 
  here 's 500k for starters . 
  jokes aside , he actually said :  it could be 5,000 , i would n't like to put an upper limit on it . 
  which is a lot different from `` no upper limit '', 
  interesting read about the procedure but if they are only managing to deport 10 ( ish ) thousand a year it sounds like a pretty underwhelming response . 
   they are liberal in that they prefer free-market over state-based solutions would n't that be a republican , or libertarian stance though . 
  small government , power to the rich/business owners , less regulation , more monopolies kinda thing . 
  valleys are a labour stronghold . 
  the constituency im in has voted labour for over 80 years yet ukip made the biggest gains here last election and is now the second largest party . 
  and if corbyn is elected i doubt i 'll be voting labour next election either . 
   we had flagged that we were conducting this poll to the daily mirror as something we might share as an interesting check on our online vs our telephone methodology , but the results seemed so `` out of line '' with all the polling conducted by ourselves and our peers -- what poll commentators would term an `` outlier '' -- that ** i `` chickened out '' of publishing the figures ** -- something i 'm sure i 'll always regret . 
  yeah right . 
  `` even though im usually totally wrong , and had labour with a nice majority two weeks ago , i totally called the election results guise ! . 
  i just decided not to publish them because they seemed outlandish results even by our usual sloppy standards . '', 
  sure proved me wrong there . 
  survation is a fine trustworthy source of information . 
  [ do n't mention the war !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6lu3xqw0 ), 
  would n't surprise me to see support for leaving gaining ground but i trust a poll by [ `` survation '' ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mirror-survation-poll-reveals-labour-5487346 ) 0 % . 
  they are the survey company for tabloids . 
  an ipsos mori or yougov poll i might lend credence too , but this poll means nothing to me . 
   a tired pr stunt at that . 
  seeing a `` flashmob '' of a bunch of people dancing around to pre-recorded music is tired . 
  i still enjoy the orchestral and choir ones though . 
  not really . 
  money gets spent tackling the symptoms not the causes . 
  it 's all very well spending xx million on social advocacy projects and breakfast clubs but without better jobs around there 's still going to be a lot of people out of work and a lot of working people in poverty . 
  this is all despite the fact wales receives eu funding and has done [ since 2000 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-29827221 ) because wales is economically deprived . 
  those stories about record child poverty and an economy worst off than areas in poland is ** after ** investing 4 billion of eu funds . 
  highest [ child poverty ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-27600900 ) in britain and places where the economy is worst off than the [ czech republic . 
  ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/welsh-valleys-bulgaria-romania-comparisons-2525215 ) independence here we come !, 
   i think most dream of independence but do n't see it as being achievable . 
  i think kids and stupid adults who have some irrational dislike of england dream of it . 
  most welsh people are probably smart enough to realize leaving would not be in the best interest of wales . 
  and plaid ... more welsh people voted for ukip last election than plaid . 
  a lot like the snp , a party to have in your devolved government but westminster ? 
   none of the countries pushing quotas have anywhere close to the same amount of foreigners in their country . 
  * < cough  [ sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden#current_population_of_immigrants_and_their_descendants ) < cough  * i suspect the opposite is true , those pushing for quotas are the ones who are reaching that 70 % point . 
  its an argument against wasting a lot of time an effort to `` contain '' discussion that is of interest to most people , has dominated the sub for a month and that will inevitably result in failure . 
  the filter idea is best imo , those who do n't want it do n't have to see it . 
   difference is that with this version the mods do n't have to personally update it multiple times per day . 
  much more sustainable . 
  if people can find a way around it and get the article on the front page they will keep trying . 
  it 'll always be a battle of wills and my money would be against the mods , no matter how many they try and recruit . 
  know what 's funny ? 
  last time i had this discussion i mocked the `` new '' content when [ i said ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3iex50/meta_right_now_there_are_11_submission_about/cug1xsu ) :  looking at `` new '' submissions it almost all seems to be news . 
  boring news nobody is interested in . 
   `` a plane and tombstones were discovered ? 
  looking at the new submissions right now and what are the odds !, 
  [ that same story about a river drying up in poland ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/polish-river-reveals-17th-century-secrets-amid-drought-142536183.html ) is there again !, 
  the submissions are shit . 
  other than immigration and the occasional ukraine/russia stuff there 's nothing of worth to comment on . 
  not even the imgur ones about how each country spells a certain word are here anymore . 
  and it 'll implode like the previous `` similar idea '' , it will make discussion more difficult and compartmentalised , people will seek to undermine and avoid it and we 'll be back here again in a month when you get bored dealing with it . 
  calling it now . 
  downvotes :( after i [ accurately predicted the demise of the previous megathread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3f1uh6/immigration_megathread_part_iii/ctmknln ) as well . 
  syrians made up about [ 10 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/b7/five_main_citizenships_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants%2c_2014_%28number%2c_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iii.png ) of applicants for asylum in the uk . 
  around [ 19 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d5/countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states%2c_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) across the whole eu last year . 
  i do n't care how shitty it is over there , countries like eritrea are n't our problem . 
   i have no illusions that they wo n't be able to do anything . 
  but they should . 
  that 's okay , we should leave it to russia . 
  im sure russia wo n't make the situation worst . 
   yet we have to solve the situation of refugees that are on the european territory right now . 
  all im saying is that if they were stopped from coming over at the start we would n't have a crisis on our hands . 
  a year of only ever saying `` we need to share the responsibility '' and `` its our duty to help them '' has made the situation a lot worst . 
  now they 're talking about safe camps and stopping the flow but with the condition of accepting the quota idea . 
  forget the quota , stopping them coming over is the absolute priority . 
  otherwise next year there will be even more . 
   no one really wants to take care of these refugees why should they when the numbers coming over are not diminishing but increasing . 
  why take in 10k now if next year you 'll be asked to take in 50k . 
  if the flow had been stopped and we were voluntarily accepting refugees from turkey and jordan im sure most countries would have no issues with relocating tens or hundreds of thousand across europe . 
  the trouble is it has n't stopped , it 's increasing , and rewarding those who come over illegally makes the situation worst . 
   that the uk has taken less than 1200 refugees from syria . 
  1200 from about 1300 syrian claims processed , plus an additional 200 directly via that program . 
  seems pretty good to me esp when syrians are only a fraction of the 30k asylum claims we process . 
  take a look at how the rest of europe , other than those 5 i mentioned , does and then come back to me . 
   you mean the one linked from an official source ? 
  yea ? 
  that one ? 
  an official source for the resettlement scheme , which you then disingenuously used to try and claim was the total amount britain took in as refugees . 
  still waiting for those sources . 
  oh look , you still ca n't provide any sources on your claim britain does not take in more refugees than 22 of the eu nations . 
  i think we both know it 'll turn out to be as correct as your disingenuous claim of 200 refugees . 
  i 'll save those links for the next time i see you in a thread bashing the uk for not doing enough , which seems to be a daily hobby of yours , despite us taking in among the highest amount and giving the most money in aid . 
  too stupid to read . 
  figures . 
  its an excel table you idiot as * clearly * i mentioned . 
  you need to open it and change it so it displays by country . 
  you were wrong about the 200 refugees , now how about you put up or shut up and show me which countries took in more than 30k asylum seekers * last year * ? 
  `` far right '' lol , you sound like a green voter . 
  since you seem to run away and not acknowledge any sources heres one for you .
