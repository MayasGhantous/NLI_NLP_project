  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-statistics-april-to-june-2015/list-of-tables the government 's statistics , in table form so someone of your capacity might struggle with them . 
  the asylum data tables will show you : britain received 2025 applications from syrians in the uk during 2014 483 were at the ports 1542 in country 1364 decisions were made , out of that 1175 were granted asylum . 
  i gave you the sources below . 
  im pretty sure ive done it several times with you . 
  like usual you will ignore it and will pop up later on spouting your unti-uk drivel . 
  over 2k last year applied in the uk and about 200 we shipped over from jordan . 
  that 187 is people who 've been granted refugee status while still in another country i.e jordan . 
  it 's already been said it 'll be expanded . 
  over [ 2k ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11842760/prepare-yourselves-the-great-migration-will-be-with-us-for-decades.html ) syrian asylum seekers magically appeared in the uk and made an asylum claim last year though . 
  nope that 's what we take directly from the unhrc camps . 
  see the word resettlement ? 
  can you work out what it means ? . 
  cameron has already said that number would be increased back in june . 
  over 30k was the total number of asylum seekers we received in the uk through other means last year . 
  as im sure you are well aware . 
  ** since you are downvoting me already allow me to provide sources to counter your constant anti-uk tirade , i look forward to you countering them ( we both know you wo n't ) ** [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states,_by_age_distribution,_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) - britain processed 31k asylum seekers in 2014 [ unhcr ] ( http://www.unhcr.org.uk/about-us/the-uk-and-asylum.html ) - britain has 117,161 refugees , 36,383 pending asylum cases and 16 stateless persons . 
  [ gov.uk ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-statistics-april-to-june-2015/asylum ) - the 200 `` refugees '' you claim we taken in are the amount from the syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme and is on top of the claims that are made in the uk . 
  nope , only 5 more countries take in more than the uk and they are hungary , italy , germany , france and sweden . 
  the fact we take in more than 22 other member states , despite having a channel to cross , shows how little the rest of europe does compared to us tbh . 
  the [ full results ] ( http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/f4rr9eo24l/yg-archive-pol-times-results-2502015-w.pdf ) are either amusing , or depressing , depending on your outlook on life . 
  particularly : `` which party do you most trust to make the right decisions on immigration '' no prizes for guessing the party which came in second behind `` none of them '', 
  well maybe not against * all * immigration . 
  but [ polls ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/03/02/why-we-like-migrants-not-immigration/ ) regularly show the majority think the current rate is too high and want it reduced . 
  75 % think recent immigration has been too high , 2 % too low . 
   maybe it has to be restated in order to shut everyone up who thinks the uk has sealed the border and is letting them squat in calais . 
  that is the narrative the guardian like to push . 
  regularly twisting figures to make it look like the uk does less than it does . 
   cameron already committed in june to moderately increase refugee numbers brought over in cooperation with unhcr . 
  would have been restating it , the guardian instead went with . 
   david cameron has ** bowed ** to growing international and domestic ** demands ** that britain take in more refugees fleeing the syrian civil war by indicating that the uk would accept ** thousands ** more refugees . 
  or maybe left wing anarchists like xnicolex call everyone against mass immigration from outside the eu a right wing fascist . 
  as someone they undoubtedly consider right wing for thier stance on immigration my results were : economic left/right : -6.25 social libertarian/authoritarian : -4.67, 
  ireland , with 1/14th of the uk 's population takes in 1/20th of asylum seekers the uk does . 
  the uk , of course , being pilloried for not doing enough to help . 
  you had [ 1.5 k ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states,_by_age_distribution,_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) asylum seekers making claims last year , whatever token amount you plan to increase it by will be just that , a token gesture . 
  last time you took an extra 300 asylum seekers on top of the 275 you were supposed to take . 
  big deal , you 'd need to take at least an extra thousand just to match what the uk took in as a percentage of its population . 
   that is asylum seekeers . 
  which includes economic immigrants who i will give you , are disproportionately male . 
  it 's asylum seekers who have put in a claim for refugee status . 
  not including economic migrants still trying to force their way across the eu or those who intend to stay in a country illegally . 
  the true percentage of males is undoubtedly higher than 70 % . 
  it 's [ 70 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_male_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu-28,_by_age_group_and_status_of_minors,_2014_%28%25%29_yb15_iii.png ) actually , overall . 
  [ 85 % ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states,_by_age_distribution,_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) of `` asylum seekers '' in italy are in the 18-34 range , which as you can see , is almost 80 % male . 
  i seem to remember [ france ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32719014 ) being for the quota idea last time and [ ireland the same ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/migrants-ireland-quota-eu-2102190-may2015/ ) . 
  it would seem from that , and the guardian article , that pretty much everyone who opposed the last quota still does . 
  im not sure how they can claim that attitude is softening to the idea other than wishful thinking . 
   surely travelling through some of the most active warzones turkey and greece , now active warzones . 
  that article is pure clickbait . 
  cameron said nothing that was n't already decided weeks ago ( and was reported on by the same fucking tabloid ) . 
  the uk has been relocating refugees from countries neighbouring syria in coordination with the unhcr [ since 2014 ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/vulnerable-persons-relocation-scheme-for-syrian-nationals ) . 
  in june cameron alleged the program would be [ `` modestly expanded '' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/refugees-welcome-uk-germany-compare-migration ) nothing in that interview shows that the uk is going to change its policy one bit in response to what happened . 
  portugal took in about [ 400 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states,_by_age_distribution,_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) asylum seekers last year and gave [ refugee status to 40 ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/article/6642148/2015/09/03/portugal-may-take-more-refugees-quota-minister ) . 
  portugal , of course , opposed the immigration quota as well . 
  compared to the 30k + the uk gets each year without taking on additional through a quota . 
  i did see allegations portugal might take in [ 1.5 k ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/portugal-prepara-acolhimento-de-refugiados-de-guerra_v854200 ) over 2 years , but that 's still far , far worst than the uk 's response . 
   what will david cameron do now ? 
  take in a token amount < 10k , probably less than 5k . 
  then the social media activists , who liked some post about accepting more immigrants , can get a warm fuzzy feeling pretending they 've done something worthwhile . 
  no , in germany they are skipping the political process and just going round committing arson against refugee shelters . 
  it 's only a matter of time before there are deaths . 
  that 's the relocation programme which brings them over directly from other countries . 
  nowhere near the total amount of refugees uk accepts . 
   between june 2014 and june 2015 , the uk took 166 syrian refugees . 
  they were resettled from camps in ** jordan ** and other neighbouring countries under a new government scheme . 
  the `` vulnerable persons '' relocation initiative began in march 2014 . 
  under it , the uk has taken 216 people . 
  in june david cameron said the scheme would be `` modestly expanded '' . 
  britain accepted over [ 10k ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_on_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applications,_2014_%28number,_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iv.png ) refugees last year , [ 2.5 k ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/b7/five_main_citizenships_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants%2c_2014_%28number%2c_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iii.png ) applicants processed were syrian . 
  compared to the 40 syrians slovakia processed claims for . 
  until your [ own country ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/justice-home-affairs/slovakia-calls-visegrad-summit-oppose-migrant-quotas-317199 ) puts up how about you shutting up about britain ? 
   oh give me a break give us all a break !, 
  it 's [ about ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jewul/czech_police_haul_migrants_off_trains_to_germany/ ) the [ fith ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3je1ad/migrants_crisis_unease_as_czech_police_ink/ ) time [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jdriv/czech_authorities_in_b%c5%99eclav_marked_refugees_with/ ) non [ story ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jc1dd/czech_police_arrests_200_refugees_and_marks_them/ ) has been posted today . 
  i do n't see how any plans so far would have prevented that kid from dying . 
  quotas and all that is all well and good but it would n't have done anything in this instance . 
  short of actually running a ferry service , or stopping him from getting on a boat , nothing would have changed the outcome . 
   the only problem is that no-one nows how we can achieve that , so if you have a plan i thought with afghanistan we were moving in the right direction as far as international interventions in that area go . 
  it 's not enough to overthrow someone , we have to stick around , train a new military and wait until free and democratic elections can be held . 
  it 's a long unpopular process unfortunately , too unpopular . 
  so now we 're back to plan a , bombing who we do n't like and hoping the group that takes over is better . 
  heartbreaking stuff . 
  does n't change my stance on the subject one iota though . 
  yeah , i think the amount of countries not wanting a quota system is a lot bigger than those who do . 
  yet several months on germany is still trying to guilt/bully everyone into doing it anyway . 
  im not going to raise to the bait of the `` italian integration '' comment either . 
  yeah right . 
  [ germany does n't profit from greece being fucked ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/08/11/despite-losing-tens-of-billions-of-e-germany-is-making-a-profit-out-of-the-greek-crisis/ ) and it definitely has n't been saying for years how it needs immigrants . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20131126/germany-needs-more-immigration ) , [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/12/27/uk-german-immigration-schaeuble-idukkbn0k50at20141227 ) , [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/11/germany-welcomes-immigrants-to-sustain-economic-gr/?page=all ), 
  another way of looking at it is germany profits from a weak greece and massive immigration and it bullies the rest of the eu into going ahead with what it wants . 
  expressly against the wishes of the uk . 
  badly . 
  google , amazon et al wo n't be able to make profits off the rest of the uk and take advantage of lower taxes in ireland . 
  we kicked the can down the road . 
  greece ended up with austerity and we 'll revisit the drama again in a couple months . 
  i was in favour of letting them go bankrupt even if it meant crashing out of the euro . 
  instead we went for the worst possible outcome . 
  still have austerity , still have no control of currency , still wo n't be able to repay . 
  regardless of personal stance on the matter the `` resolution '' was hardly a glowing endorsement for eu unity . 
  you forgot the / s at the end . 
  if we can turn our backs on greece we can do it to asylum seekers .
