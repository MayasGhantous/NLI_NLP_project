   they are running for their lives from a region which was anally raped for decades by your fuckin queen and her enslaving france is n't * that * bad . 
  convenient since there will be no end to them arriving . 
   according to you scotland should just vote tories , just cause ... or labour , or even at a stretch lib dems . 
  seriously though why should tories give a shit about scotland ? 
  you voting snp does n't affect them in the least . 
  if anything it makes them stronger , they will ignore scotland happy in the knowledge the ignorant nationalists will just vote snp anyway . 
   e ) according to you the party of which scotland voted en masse is powerless in westminster , leading one to believe that scotland in the uk is wasting its time politically ... do you understand democracy at all ? 
  what power do snp mp 's have in westminster ? 
  if say the tories wanted to increase tax 10 % in on scottish oil revenue what would snp party do ? 
  nothing . 
  they do n't have enough seats to matter in the least . 
  at least if you had 50 labour mp 's there would be a serious voice in the opposition party , looking out for scotlands interests , but you do n't even have that . 
   funniest part though is that you did n't address any of the other points made in the previous post because you know they 're correct . 
  you made three points and i showed all three were wrong . 
  scotland does have a 10 billion shortfall , does not collect more tax per head and has zero representation in government or opposition . 
  i hoped you would vote for independence , would have been fun watching you crash and burn . 
  you did n't though you bottled it and now with oil prices as they are you can kiss even that pipe dream goodbye . 
  like a lot of people his age he could n't use a computer and does n't have one , he was forced to painfully walk to town centre to use the library ones several times a week . 
  i know he applied for jobs , i helped him do them , but nobody is going to hire someone his age and in his condition . 
  the whole thing is a farce . 
  nothing about the system is designed to help people , just get them off job seekers at any cost . 
   guy 's still breathing ? 
  fit to work !, 
  ive done some social advocacy volunteering and know a guy in his 60 's who worked in an asbestos factory for decades . 
  doctors told him he has the lungs of a 90 yr old , ca n't walk up a flight of stairs , needs a cane to get around . 
  he 's not only declared fit for work but the work programme he 's on puts him forward for factory jobs which he ( unsurprisingly ) fails the medicals for . 
  he 's been sanctioned once for not doing enough to look and lives in fear of getting sanctioned again . 
  the whole system is a bad joke . 
  saying that though those figures do n't necessarily prove anything on their own . 
  for all we know that might be the average rate of deaths for people with those types of conditions . 
  im okay with migrants in general . 
  we have a large , recent , polish population in wales and tbh i prefer them to the locals . 
  like all non green voters im against illegal immigration and , like most people , think the current rate is far to high . 
  keep telling yourself that [ only right wingers ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/03/02/why-we-like-migrants-not-immigration/ ) do n't wants tens/hundreds of thousands of non-eu economic migrants arriving in the country . 
  while they 're reeling from that , we can follow up with a whist drive , a car boot sale , some street theatre and possibly even some benefit concerts . 
  if that 's not enough , i 'm sorry , it 's time for the t-shirts, 
  i remember a bunch of us skipping school and catching the train to cardiff to drink and watch the 1999 rugby world cup matches in pubs . 
  i also remember several teachers were present on the train . 
  we pretended not to see each other . 
   would be nice to know their criteria . 
  these '' [ letters ] ( http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/?fa=60380 ) '' are what they based a countries foreign policy ambition on . 
  what they mean is `` asylum seekers '' or `` migrants '' . 
  refugees have to be granted that status . 
  a year ago we gave them [ # 12 million ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11110967/uk-will-give-12m-to-calais-in-a-bid-to-stop-hundreds-of-migrants-reaching-britain.html ) and a dozen miles of high security fencing used in the nato summit . 
  the major of calais is a worthless individual , unwilling to do anything about the immigrants in her town but quick to demand money and make threats . 
  they have not been integrated , neither are the latinos or the asians . 
  still waiting for examples of successful peaceful integration . 
   2nd - tax collected in scotland is higher per head than that of anywhere else in the uk . 
  we receive less than what we give in taxes . 
  could you have swallowed that pro independence propaganda any harder ? 
   the [ figures for 2012/13 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-28879267 ) assume that 84.2 % of taxes from uk oil and gas accrued to scotland , a geographic share calculated by experts from the university of aberdeen based on the existing north sea fisheries boundary . 
   allocate the oil on a ** population basis ** ( 8.3 % rather than 84.2 % ) and scotland 's tax receipts for 2012/13 were # 48.1 bn ( rather than # 53.1 bn ) , equivalent to * 8.2 % * of the uk total tax take . 
   in 2012/13 total public spending in scotland was estimated to be # 65.2 bn , or 9.3 % of total uk spending , with a population of 8.3 % . 
   ** even by the most generous measure , scotland raised # 53.1 bn in 2012/13 and spent # 65.2 bn , leaving the country # 12.1 bn short ** . 
  even assuming ridiculously optimistic oil revenues you were still 12 billion short . 
   `` less '' representation , that 's cute . 
  scottish constituencies have one mp in government and one in the opposition party . 
  by voting snp you have have zero influence in westminster . 
  why should the tories give a shit about scotland ? 
  you 're not going anywhere and snp have no power , it would be a waste of effort for them to actually try and improve scotland . 
  scottish independence is childish dream that comes crashing down in the cold light of day . 
   both sides have to be willing to integrate someone . 
  im willing to bet the amount of peoples that have been successfully integrated ( without someone using oppressive force ) is pretty low . 
  even in america there are huge issues with race and its still pretty much segregated . 
  you could almost forget the civil rights movement happened the inequality between black and white americans is so large . 
  it was well known scotland would end up 8-10 billion a year worst off even factoring in the ridiculous + $ 100 per barrel of oil . 
   i suppose in your world the scottish people are now even more naive considering that the snp is polling 62 % for next years scottish general election ? 
  i think it was pretty stupid for a country that earns less tax per citizen than england and receives more funding per citizen than england to think it would possibly be better off financially if it left . 
  voting for them in westminster was just ... wow ! . 
  how does it feel to have even less representation than normal ? 
   ever thought that scots whom voted yes wanted the scottish government to have the fiscal levers to deal with economical issues that arise ? 
  being poorer , now a fiscal lever . 
   how much does a refugee receive in britain ? 
  by the looks of it # 36.95 a week ( # 147 pm ) , plus free housing , healthcare education etc. 
  give all the 18-35 yr old male asylum seekers basic military training and weapons , ship them to ukraine . 
  be amusing to see russia on the receiving end of that tactic . 
  winner gets to keep ukraine . 
  it 's sad that i have to point this out but , for the humourless individuals with no ability to spot facetiousness , * im not being serious * . 
   that is going to form your opinion on a complex geopolitical problem no , my opinion was formed by the numbers , they do n't add up in portugal 's favour . 
  why i posted that response might have been affected by an individuals posting on the subject . 
  and it might be a `` complex problem '' but that does n't change the fact portugal has done next to nothing during it . 
  awful lot of these types of crimes being committed in germany though . 
   how much do refugees get paid , as subsistence money , in wales ? 
  the same as in the rest of the uk . 
   what do you propose portugal should do to get more asylum applicants ? 
  do n't care , i just remember some [ scrub ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ia0gc/illegal_immigrants_working_in_uk_face_six_months/cuew6l1?context=3 ) from portugal in every thread about the uk having a go at us for our reaction . 
  theres also a lot of comments on this sub , and in the media , about the uk 's response . 
  yet when it comes to `` refugees '' and the reaction to the crisis there 's a whole lot of countries that should shut up before they criticize the uk . 
  do n't tell me you used the default google description of word origins ... 
  claim [ latin clamare ] majority [ medieval latin maj\u014drit\u0101s ] french [ late latin francus ] stupid [ latin stupidus ] without a doubt * latin * words . 
  after latin i would say scandinavian/germanic origins is next in line . 
  french though ? 
  as in words originating in france ? 
  lol no . 
   1900/440 is 4.3 which certainly is more , but guess what , the uk is richer , more people want to go there . 
  not our fault . 
  that 1.9 k was from wales alone which has a third of the population and about a third of the gdp of portugal . 
  even adding an extra 750 per year that still a pathetic contribution . 
  surprising how many people fell for it as well . 
  [ dodged a bullet there .
