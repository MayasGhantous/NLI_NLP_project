  hey mamma has my vote . 
  you are right . 
  my phone kept changing it so i gave up . 
  `` french * fans cheering her on '' camera was on people holding a german flag . 
  * i messed it up three times . 
  not bad france . 
  and you guys said you would take last place off us ? 
  not bad at all . 
  i quite like it . 
  what is up with the dramatic shift in camera angles . 
  says he ca n't go on then walks around stage . 
  mate the reason why the girl does n't like you is because you contradict yourself pal . 
  `` do you have a super power ? '', 
  right presenter : i 've killed 10 people . 
  speak up love . 
  i ca n't hear you . 
  more sabaton is needed in every part of life . 
  poor man 's blink 182, 
  nothing to lose, 
  ** because i am titanium **, 
  i thought i would hate it but it 's a nice mix . 
  i like it . 
  they asked some guys from the local bar to dance . 
  everyone i know thinks this one will win . 
  i have n't heard it yet . 
  is it good ? 
  i quite like this last placed song . 
  to be fair she does have a good voice but eurovision tradition is eurovision tradition . 
  but she has n't used a hammer and screwdriver on her teeth ? 
  * comes back from making a tea * wait hang on lad . 
  `` never give up on you '' i already did on you winning . 
  and now for the last place song ... 
  no that 's our excuse . 
  though we are trying to do well . 
  no that belongs to us . 
  they would swallow for their lover . 
  juan direction, 
  `` do it for your lover '' `` but i do n't want a haircuts mum '', 
  not a bad dance track . 
  and 10 is the only bodies they found but their was evidence for more in his freezer . 
  i swear that presenter on the right is going to come through the screen and kill me in my sleep . 
  `` do n't be afraid to get it all out at eurovision '' they might regret saying that . 
  if you ignore a map they are quite clearly in europe . 
  khal drogo earlier was looking for him i hear, 
  not too bad . 
  his face on the big screen with wing blowing through his hair is a bit strange though . 
  a pretty good song though . 
  very well done . 
  needs more cowbell, 
  american christmas movie intro there . 
  god the next one is n't bad luck brian stepping on mouse traps is it ? 
  wait was that a horse mask ? 
  that is the easiest dance job ever . 
  stand at the top of the ladder and move a bit . 
  is she throwing up ? 
  very pretty song but sadly do n't think it will do well . 
  best personality i 've seen in a while . 
  i like her voice ... and personality . 
  is he italian or is he a hipster who got lost heading to the coffee shop ? 
  quite a happy sounding song . 
  i like the classical/rap mix there . 
  not too bad . 
  khal drogo went into singing ? 
  this one is catchy and is n't too bad . 
  silly backing dancers . 
  flowers are not a mic . 
  `` i 've been here 6 times '' poor guy , must be mentally ill . 
  the 00 's are over girls . 
  it does . 
  i would love to go one day . 
  ** dramatic camera angles **, 
  is it me or has ed sheeran done something to his hair ? 
  he looks different but aounds the same . 
  my thoughts go out to those lost and the swedish people . 
  it seems like every day we see a new attack like this . 
  the worse part is really we are powerless to prevent it . 
  all it takes is one idiot and a van . 
  that 's what gets at me the most . 
  i ca n't understand why they do this . 
  people are just going about their day and the this happens . 
  i just feel sad . 
  i hope he 's ok pal . 
  my thoughts go out to the russians and those lost . 
  it 's always makes me sad to learn of stuff like this . 
  so anywhere where farage is then ? 
  i do n't think i 've even seen him do an interview where he is not in or at least near a pub . 
  hey us welshmen like our holes in the ground thank you very much . 
  i do n't see any evidence that she is n't an elephant so he 's not wrong . 
  the next 5 years will be . 
  it will make or break us as a country . 
  i just want to say thank you to my european brother 's and sister 's for having us in the eu but we must depart . 
  no matter what governments say or do we are still the same people we were yesterday . 
  no matter what happens we are still friends . 
  good luck for the future and best of luck . 
  we walk a lonely road but it 's also a road of adventure . 
  it will be bumpy but i 'm putting faith it will work out in the end ( i have to think that or i 'll go crazy ), 
  a referendum on which class of stamps to use . 
  first or second . 
  i agreed with you . 
  just seems fucked up in the sense it 's come to this .
