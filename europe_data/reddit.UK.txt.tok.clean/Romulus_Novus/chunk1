[ i 'd actually recommend it ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=684459310 ), 
  a few kippers and a couple of edl idiots . 
  that 's about all i reckon, 
  i 'm still trying to figure out who that it with just a mouth, 
  i 've always been a little confused about how accepted latin would be for this sort of thing . 
  it did unite a lot of europe linguistically throughout history , but does n't have a historical root in a lot of northern and eastern europe, 
  [ this maybe ?

  well , my country 's politics is currently going to shit but at least it 's still throwing out twists every now and again, 
  well in all fairness we expect neutrality according to the law when it comes to tv news . 
  i 'd quite like to see that extended to newspapers so you do n't see this sort of shite printed regularly, 
  it seems likely to still happen , but , provided this is n't overturned by the supreme court , hard brexit is now basically unthinkable as a goal to pursue, 
  i think you 'd just get a response along the lines of `` how 's that my fucking problem ? '' . 
  you simply ca n't get rid of accent in the uk , just ask people to talk slower, 
  that interesting - the perception in the uk is that you guys are up there with the scandinavian countries and the netherlands, 
  there are some very isolated parts of wales that basically only speak welsh . 
  but , they amount to an incredibly small population numbering , at most , in the low thousands, 
  even without getting into the immigration debate , some parts of wales basically do n't have anybody who understands english, 
  it 's a tricky situation as you say - what would be a `` standard '' english ( seeing as scotland , wales , northern ireland , and the republic of ireland are their own set of difficulties ) be ? 
  well gentrification is its own issue , but i would say it 's a bubble . 
  i mean , that was a cheapish house in 1950 and is now worth over # 1,000,000 . 
  there are n't enough people buying houses that have inflated to that price to keep the market sustainable , unless you are throwing out huge mortgages left , right , and centre . 
  and shown from 2007/2008 , that does n't end well, 
  how 's that good ? 
  does that not just seem like an enormous bubble waiting to burst to you ? 
  pretty much . 
  it just sucks for the 48 % who have to suffer either way and , right now at least , are being completely ignored, 
  well i 've typically found that the ones who are anti-europe in the sense of taking back sovereignty also tend to be pro single market ? 
  i guess there 's hope in any case , may is literally being taken to court to make sure that she does n't just arbitrarily decide what happens so we might still not be in the worst timeline, 
  i do n't even know anyone who voted leave that * does * think it makes economic sense . 
  i 've met some people who basically boil it down to not wanting `` those people flooding europe over here '' , people who are just outright xenophobic , or , and although i do n't agree with the argument it 's the one that makes the most sense to me , those who are just against the european project i mean hell , on the last point i 've met people who honestly look horrified when they find out i 'm a federalist, 
  i do n't dispute that . 
  but the alternative - not being in the single market ala norway/switzerland - would most likely tank the economy . 
  then you might actually see people abandon the tories and end up with ... ukip ? 
  the tories would hate * either * option it 's not a good deal , but it 's the least bad, 
  precisely , that 's the offer i 'm expecting her to , eventually , with much protestation , accept . 
  if it 's still even being offered at that point ... 
  i still reckon that may 's going to make a lot of bluster and , when she realises that everyone is being serious about treating the uk like it deserves , she 's going to go the negotiations with her tail between her legs and accept whatever they 're offering that might not crash the damn economy, 
  i think that was the guy 's point ... ? 
  oh fuck right off . 
  being embarrassed to be british does not mean you hate this country . 
  if anything it shows that you care as otherwise why would you feel that embarrassment ? 
  [ this ? 
  i would say it 's neither racial nor wealth - it 's literally just whether you happened to be born in the anglosphere . 
  american ? 
  australian ? 
  new zealand ? 
  immigrant . 
  french ? 
  immigrant it 's fucking ridiculous , but there 's very little you can do to change it at this point, 
  err ... no they do n't . 
  you can be an mp , and therefore theoretically prime minister , with irish or commonwealth citizenship, 
  unless you 're the one implying that all working class people are `` xenophobic nationalist halfwits '' , and that such is characteristic of the working class , then that analogy makes no sense, 
  considering you 're the one that just made that implication , not me ... ? 
  i do n't hate working class , obviously, 
  you know what , i did read though that . 
  you 've enlightened me - i did n't know they were also climate change deniers , so that 's lovely in all seriousness , i do think that vibrant political debate is what makes democracy great . 
  but , in my opinion , farage and his ilk want to limit this to only english people and let the mob rule . 
  or , as he put it , `` give a national referendum on the issue of greatest importance to the british public every two years '', 
  my opinion changed from them being a nuisance , to them having caused irreparable harm to this country . 
  i have looked into them , quite a bit in fact , but , for me , their policies regarding anybody not of british heritage are a red line i could even accept that they could make an argument against the eu , albeit one i probably would n't agree with , but they literally all came down to a slightly more salesman-like `` spray paint `` sod off '' on the white cliffs of dover '' . 
  i 'd be happy to be proven wrong but , let 's face it , if ukip actually ended up in government they 'd be like a dog that finally caught a cat - it would n't know what to do with it, 
  ukip are a one-policy party . 
  they scream from the rooftops , as much as they damn well please , to the contrary . 
  but that it is all they are , and all they ever will be . 
  and that policy seeks to isolate britain from the world , and divide everybody into ` us ' and ` them ' . 
  there is no way around this - this is what ukip is, 
  oh for love of ... ukip are , *** definitionally *** , small-minded bigots . 
  they propose cutting off proper relations with our closest economic , political , military , and cultural allies for seemingly no reason other some nostalgic idea of a time when `` britannia ruled the waves '' i do n't really know how else to explain it . 
  how would you describe a party whose leader said that he would describe getting a chinese meal as a `` chinky '' , said that he would n't want to live next to romanians due to the sheer fact that they happened to be romanian , and , in the run up to the general election last year , were seemingly expelling candidates every other day for saying like [ gays cause bad weather ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-25793358 ) ukip complain that the tories are taking their policies , which is rich considering that they were trying to create a more presentable front for bnp admirers who were too embarrassed to be openly racist . 
  farage has created a climate whereby racism is a part of british politics and this was either through ignorance or intent . 
  honestly , i do n't even know which of those two possibilities is worse i do n't doubt that they are genuinely trying to make britain great again in their minds . 
  but their vision of greatness would take us back to the 1950s and , quite frankly , i 'd rather prefer being in the bloody 21st century if you do n't get it now , you never will and wo n't waste my damn time anymore, 
  hey , ` tis no problem  i just think that , considering the rather violent and volatile history of this continent , you 'd quickly get stuck in the mud arguing about who owns what if you went with the rightful line, 
  you have to admit that whole `` rightful nation '' thing is rather inflammatory . 
  both sides have reasonable arguments to make and that 's fair enough , but ultimately should n't it come down to allowing the people of gibraltar self determination ? 
  yeah because that 's part of ukip 's headline manifesto ... you know *** exactly *** what i meant - do n't be deliberately obtuse, 
  well , considering that they stand for pandering to xenophobic nationalist halfwits , i 'd say i do, 
  well said . 
  despise everything ukip stand for but this is beyond the pale, 
  off topic i know but i love the acronym baltron . 
  sounds like the baltic nations are going to unite as some sort of mecha, 
  oddly enough , a lot of those guys and r/altright tend to turn up in the uk based subreddits whenever nigel is mentioned, 
  that is something i 've noticed with a couple of european languages i 've looked at . 
  i know i 'm just showing stereotypical ignorance of other languages here , but i 'm assuming that there are words for scotland , wales and northern ireland right ? 
  this is why i do n't get why some people are really anal about calling people from the u.s. ` americans ' when it does n't cover all of the americas . 
  nobody in their right mind would start calling the irish british , and yet somehow the american things is different ? 
  i really can not adequately express the contempt i hold for that man, 
  considering that he 's fucked off to america to help trump , hopefully we never see him again, 
  i believe it was two certain politicians in fact, 
  whilst i certainly wo n't defend my country 's colonial past in india , the banning of sati did lead to this rather amazing quote from charles james napier when asked whether the ban could be rescinded :  `` be it so . 
  this burning of widows is your custom ; prepare the funeral pile . 
  but my nation has also a custom . 
  when men burn women alive we hang them , and confiscate all their property . 
  my carpenters shall therefore erect gibbets on which to hang all concerned when the widow is consumed . 
  let us all act according to national customs . '', 
  and now comes the ironic un appointment - i 'm thinking un envoy for eu relations, 
  liverpool alone would be a ridiculous amount, 
  not that it matters at this point , but it seems fairly likely that corbyn probably voted to leave the eu, 
  yeah , i think you kind of answered your own question there .
