  so unless you 're suggesting we kickstart the empire again , what exactly is your point ? 
  currently not independent and , although i love scotland , they would n't make up for the loss in eu trade even if they were, 
  yeah . 
  from an outsider 's perspective it 's fascinating watching the presidential elections this time around - the gop looks like it could well implode as a result of this as trump appears to have alienated a lot of potential voters for the foreseeable future . 
  and trump , much like brexit , is a prime example of what happens when populist nationalism manages to hit the ground running i know exactly what you mean , though that ease of communication can lead to problems - i personally managed to get locked in my own little bubble , university educated 18-25 year olds , and know a grand total of three people who are anti-eu which clearly is n't reflective of society as a whole, 
  how are you supposed to have a single market without regulation ? 
  that makes no sense ? 
  and furthermore , what anglophone nations are we going to be trading with exactly ? 
  australia and new zealand are too far away , america and canada are close but have their own thing going , india is fucking enormous and most of the african nations would be raw materials , which is a pity as we do n't produce anything, 
  oddly enough , my understanding is that the republicans were starting to get that they could n't just rely on their traditional demographic and started targeting hispanic voters ? 
  and then trump just sort of happened but yeah , if you look at the raw age demographics then , presuming that younger people still tend to be pro-eu , it seems fairly inevitable that opinion will swing the other way in a decade or two . 
  though , oddly enough , once you get to people who lived through the war you get eu support again, 
  though fortunately it does look like those demographics are on the decline . 
  so if we do end up going through with this , we could end up in a situation where there is broad support for proper european integration the next time there is a referendum, 
  considering that we have a tory government that has been proven to pursue ideology over evidence , i would n't get my hopes up ... 
  as am i - it might convince the brexiters that they ca n't just sail the rest of us off into the sunset whilst giving the rest of europe the two-fingered salute, 
  yeah ... making a blanket statement that everyone in the uk thinks the same way you do might be a tad hyperbolic . 
  quite a lot of people put no faith in her actually doing this as tories have , consistently , shown that their word on something is worthless, 
  in all fairness , i think both extreme sides ( that being the full-brexit and no-brexit crowds ) are going to be disappointed at the end of all this - nobody 's going to get all they want, 
  that 's true enough , but i would also argue that that does n't necessarily bring about the type of change that a lot of people are expecting . 
  we wo n't leave the common market , meaning we get freedom of movement regardless, 
  yeah , that would be a problem . 
  i seem to be something of an oddity on the british left that quite likes that we meet the 2 % military spending that nato recommends . 
  it gives us the ability to project power when needed, 
  so that would mean that germany , for example , has no guarantee of sovereignty ? 
  i disagree with nuclear weapons , and think that there should be disarmament - just not unilateral disarmament, 
  [ he 's a pretty shit populist ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn-labour-tories-poll-all-time-low-general-election-a7134761.html ), 
  yes and yes . 
  corbyn seems to be someone they genuinely like and , originally at least , i was totally on board with them . 
  it 's just become apparent over the last year that there 's a reason he was a backbencher other than just disagreeing with party leadership . 
  that he 's unelectable [ really does n't seem to be a problem ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/momentum-chief/ ) as for new labour hatred , everything and everyone that opposes corbyn is declared to be a blairite - regardless of whether the description fits or not . 
  make of that what you will, 
  i do dream of an snp equivalent for north england, 
  [ i think they 've already promised that . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-result-lib-dems-remain-liberal-democrats-live-policy-stay-leave-a7103186.html ) hell , if i could i 'd honestly consider voting snp despite not being scottish . 
  i agree with a lot of what they say , trident aside , and they seem to be one of two major parties in this country with their head screwed on right now, 
  corbyn is what had me so worried that the conservative membership would vote in leadsom . 
  corbyn is evidence as to why you should spend a few years at least in the ( shadow ) cabinet before gaining party leadership i mean , i 'm in liverpool so my vote effectively makes no difference . 
  i 'll likely be going green/lib dem due to their stance on europe which , again , is something i 'd appreciate corbyn at least being honest about, 
  as someone who actually agrees with corbyn on quite a lot of things domestically , his foreign policy stances are just infuriating . 
  labour needs someone ** like ** him , but with some common sense, 
  just to correct you , it 's the mps that are trying to oust him , not the members . 
  he still has overwhelming support in the membership, 
  just to clarify in case anyone 's wondering , the membership of the party seems to be enamoured with the guy . 
  combine that with very lacklustre alternatives , and it 's a situation that 's not likely to change for a while, 
  i did n't even mean that ... 
  but i like the way you think, 
  really , people do n't come out with excuses ? 
  pretty sure i see a lot of '' ( s ) he had mental issues '' thrown around quite a bit . 
  seems like an excuse to me , particularly when the idiots that come out with this then do n't do anything about the issue and the overwhelming majority of muslims do , obviously , condemn such actions . 
  just because they follow a different faith does n't mean that they are n't fundamentally humans - just like the rest of us because people , such as yourself , tend to associate all muslims with such incidents of course a lot of them are going to be vocal about defending themselves from completely baseless accusations . 
  i mean hell , northern ireland had massive amounts of sectarian violence but no-one said that every protestant and every catholic was an issue , just a tiny majority of lunatics on both sides then again , i 'm seeing a lot of defence of milo yiannopoulos , trump , and their like in your comment history so it seems likely that i 'm arguing with a wall here, 
  well the sweetheart part would be the fact that this deal would give is single market access without freedom of movement . 
  it 's a fucking stupid plan because , as everyone has been pointing out , it has a 0 % chance of not being vetoed but it would be a * remarkably * good deal for the uk, 
  should n't we be paying ** more ** for a `` better '' deal ? 
  fairly sure we do n't get a choice in neighbours regardless , unless we 're floating off to jamaica like in that walkers advert ... 
  well we could technically do that , but i doubt we 'd really benefit from that ... 
  the second world war was n't really britain 's time as the `` dominant superpower '' . 
  it was , on paper at least , a three-way tie between the usa , the british empire , and the soviet union, 
  i still do n't see why the eu would or should now give a shit about the uk 's economy but whatever . 
  and i 've seen enough politicians , and in particular conservatives , lie or make up immigration targets they have no intention of meeting to put much weight behind that statement, 
  unless those cars somehow make up 80 % of either the eu 's or another country 's economy , i really do n't see how the two are comparable . 
  without passporting , the uk 's economy does n't function properly . 
  we do n't get passporting without accepting freedom of movement with an eea deal, 
  yes because the services sector , which makes up around 80 % of the uk economy , is really the equivalent of them selling us ~ ~ a few cars ~ ~ around [ # 31 billion worth of cars ] ( http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/abs/annual-business-survey/car-production/sty-car.html ) . 
  for comparison , finance brought in around [ # 116 billion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_kingdom#financial_and_business_services ), 
  why on earth would the eu give us services passporting ? 
  they were already annoyed at us for getting preferential treatment and being treated with the kid gloves , so you 're suggesting they go even more out of their way to placate small-minded nationalists ? 
  we either accept an eea deal , which is undeniably worse but the best we can hope for , or rightfully get told to fuck off, 
  i get what you mean , particularly when it comes to the sheer numbers involved . 
  what i was saying though is that whilst the 65 + demographic did vote majority leave , you go a slightly odd situation when you got to the 80 + demographic who leaned back towards remain, 
  i 've read it was the other way around - those who had lived through the war tended to vote remain, 
  let 's see ... * suggesting people should be happy with a 52/48 split - check * bringing up / u/davvw 's nationality as a criticism - check * denial regarding whether the uk can survive without eu trade - check [ seems about right ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jkmb4kf.png ), 
  you 're allowed to have an opinion as to whether this is a good or bad sign for future british foreign policy , but do n't be a twat - you 're just fulfilling a stereotype, 
  yeah ... 
  especially considering that a lot of countries ' independence days are celebrating independence from the uk ... 
  the implication that anyone who voted to remain was n't / is n't an `` ordinary , decent person '', 
  fair play to him for apologising for that , now if only he 'd take back his `` victory for ordinary , decent people '' comment . 
  thanks for the link, 
  just out of interest , do you have a link to that apology ? 
  i had n't heard about it, 
  and this was after essentially insulting every single remain voter . 
  i really do loathe that man ... 
  going the `` sins of the father '' route i see ... 
  what ? 
  how the hell am i an imperialist ? 
  i do n't think bringing crimea into this is really helping your point ... 
  pretty much this . 
  if we had a more proportional system , the momentum guys could go off and either support their own party or return to green/swp voting . 
  but fptp means they have to concentrate on labour , whilst driving a lot of people away to a third party, 
  that 's part of the problem - they 've been trying to . 
  the parliamentary labour party openly hate him and have been trying to make his position untenable , whilst he 's also massively unpopular with voters . 
  but the membership love him , and particularly the momentum guys whose leader openly said that [ winning elections does n't matter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zpvqof7j5m&amp;ab_channel=chrisguido ) effectively , these guys should probably be voting green or even the socialist workers party , but are using labour due to name recognition, 
  the fuck poland ? 
  how did this happen ? 
  wait , what 's poland 's problem with vegetarians ? 
  depends on how badly they think they could beat labour into the floor, 
  no , he was n't . 
  spiro agnew was nixon 's vice president , elected alongside him in 1972 , but was forced to resign after a bribery/money laundering scandal . 
  ford was appointed as vice president , under the advice of congress , in , as you pointed out , 1973 through the 25 ^ th amendment .
