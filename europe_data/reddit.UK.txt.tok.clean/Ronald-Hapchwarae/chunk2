  the answer is it did n't it said european countries , which gibraltar is one . 
  my knowledge of where andorra is is lacking so i ca n't make out on the picture if andorra is on it , if i could and it was i would have said . 
  gibraltar certainly is n't a sovereign nation , foreign affairs are handled by the uk government but as all british overseas territories are it is a country . 
  domestic policy is solely on the assembly ( i believe that is what the gibraltaran one is called ) . 
  it is more similar to puerto rico than french guiana yes . 
  gibraltar is on the iberian peninsula , which is in europe . 
  gibraltar is a country . 
  it meets both qualifiers so i fail to see how it is n't included . 
  how so ? 
  it is a country and we are looking at european countries in the picture , gibraltar features quite prominently in that . 
  if we look at a map of europe we would n't leave out portugal because the other nations are so much greater . 
  ** european countries **, 
  gibraltar is an overseas territory so it is a country . 
  and gibraltar, 
  article 39 magna carta states that no freeman can be taken a slave and williams edict states that christians ca n't be sold as pagans . 
  my guess here would be as the slaves had already been enslaved by muslim and pagan africans it did n't count . 
  the general trend of the laws were one could n't enslave a chrisitian , certainly one could n't sell a christian to a pagan . 
  we even made the your grand nation stop slaving with our peace talks following the * bloody * war between us in the napolionic age . 
  we were the first european nation to end slavery and forced multiple other nations to do the same , not to mention we are the first nation to send our navy to stop slavery . 
  i 've heard it argued the eu existed a lot longer than it acutally has ( 1991 onwards after the treaty of maastricht ) . 
  before this clip the earliest i heard it argued was 1957 . 
  1772 is quite the way back to be arguing the eu existed , is it not ? 
  somerset v stewart 1772 . 
  so after the war the british got these wonderful laws inplace in europe that the british only have because after the war the british got these wonderful laws inplace in europe that the british only have because after the war the british got these wonderful laws inplace in europe . 
  very circular . 
  to quote ; oh fuck off . 
  likely very favourable terms with the nazis with much of great britian remaining inderpendant similar to vichy france , we could 've even been given back ireland . 
  hitler liked the uk , it was a germanic nation after all . 
  as for the greater empire i think likely we 'd have kept much of it but important land may have gone directly to the germans . 
  had britian done this it would free up the nazis to go and attack the soviets , the entire western border would be secure with germanys borders with non axis nations being spain only and the huge royal navy to defend the ocean from a very unlikely attack from the americas . 
  the nazis would also be able to get the oil of the middle east as british egypt was now under nazi rule thus they 'd be able to continue the eastern push agaisnt the soviets and likely crush them also . 
  the vatican has no permanent population so there is no proper resident of the vatican who is religious, 
  on matters of scottish susession it is only right they alone vote for it . 
  in 2014 the scots said aye to being within a union that includes england and wales . 
  they knew a referenda on uk membership would likley be held in the next westminster parliment . 
  the only way scotland could guarantee thier short term membership to the eu . 
  that was n't a definant . 
  the majority of socts said aye to being an equal citizen of a trans-national union . 
  they were treat as such and due to this in 2016 we voted to leave . 
  the scots had no way to remain in the eu really . 
  they left in 2014 they leave the eu . 
  now no matter what they leave the eu . 
  with this in mind and the fact that most scots do n't want to rejoin the eu it is n't too much of one , is it ? 
   i mean if i was one of the scots who voted to remain in uk in order to not lose eu membership i would be pretty furious right now . 
  why ? 
  you see your voice as greater than that of the welsh and english ? 
  we voted as equals , the vote of a scot was worth one . 
  the vote of a taff or pom was too worth one , we are equals . 
  the remain side was outvoted , the leave side won . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/15/nicola-sturgeon-abandons-bid-remain-eu-poll-shows-record-level/amp/ rejoining and remaining are n't the same . 
  https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/09/01/davidson-now-more-popular-sturgeon-scotland/ the scots do n't even want a second indyref and when there is one ; https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/03/15/scottish-independence-voting-intention-no-57-yes-4/ they back remaining . 
  the campaign was voting yes meant you left the eu . 
  voting no meant you would stay but they knew a uk wide referenda on the issue would be held shortly thereafter . 
  they were in favour of staying , they are n't in favour of rejoining . 
  also the economic argument has weakened since 2014 and really makes no sense for the scots to leave the cta for the eea . 
  she would n't have to but it would be very hard not to . 
  i believe and hope the scots vote to remain in the uk if they ever have a 2nd indyref but the snp trying to win by voter fatigue is n't in line with the principle of self determination . 
  in 2014 the scots self determinated to be a member of the united kingdom . 
  to go against that goes against the principle of the right . 
  no but in 2014 the scots voted to remain part of the uk knowing full well a uk wide referenda on eu membership would be held . 
  i have yet to read what the scots parliament passed , i doubt it 'll have equivalent balances to what they wanted in the eu referenda . 
  the snp could have a referenda on any issue . 
  if their parliment ca n't act on it it is pointless . 
  only westminster has the power for this . 
  brexit was a mandated law however . 
  our civil service and politicans will be a bit caught up on brexit to deal with the scottish question i believe is the point . 
  i doubt it , the snp will always find a substantive change to justify a new refernda . 
  it probably wo n't . 
  the majority of socts do n't want a second refernda and support of the union is far greater than support of inderpendance , to add to this most scots aslo do n't want to rejoin the eu so brexit likely wo n't play to big a part . 
  snp played their hand well here but i doubt it will secure inderpendance . 
  before the corbyn leadership ie 2010-2016 blarite always appeard an insult it only appears recently with the corbyn wave that the term is self used . 
  i still forget europeans put [ , ] where i 'd put [ . ], 
  so read that number as 3500 , a very high chance of that was the case . 
  can any dutch people give me odds on pvv denk coalition ? 
  do they show the division of the seats as the result goes up ? 
  also is that 11/12 in the morning or evening ? 
  i also think the anc have quotas on coaches in super rugby , whenever you end meritocracy for quotas the quality will drop . 
  i 'm saying we have a common intrest in bestiality . 
  when the anc started issuing black and coloured quotas i imagine . 
  a policy that started around april 2016 . 
  it happened because the 2015 rwc squad was made up of ~ ~ the best possible south african players ~ ~ mostly whites , likely majority white due to the fact ~ ~ in south africa rugby union football is mostly played by whites [ i believe ] ~ ~ south african rugby is really racist and select whites over good players . 
  scotland have italy at home they ca n't change their value . 
  if wales beat france we gain 0.90 ( they lose the same amount . 
  if england win ireland lose 0.22 ( england gain the same amount , so if it goes scotland w wales w england w the world ranking table would look nation | rank [ change ] | value [ change ] -- | -- | -- kiwi | 1 | 94.78 pom | 2 | 91.23 [ +0.22 ] ozzie | 3 | 86.35 taffy | 4 [ +2 ] | 83.06 [ +0.90 ] paddy | 5 [ -1 ] | 82.96 [ -0.22 ] jock | 6 [ -1 ] | 82.18 however if ireland win nation | rank [ change ] | value [ change ] -- | -- | -- kiwi | 1 | 94.78 pom | 2 | 89.23 [ -1.78 ] ozzie | 3 | 86.35 paddy | 4 | 84.96 [ +1.78 ] taffy | 5 [ +1 ] | 83.06 [ +0.90 ] jock | 6 [ -1 ] | 82.18 http://irbrankingcalculator.azurewebsites.net/, 
  that entire point is faulty at best . 
  goats are what muslims fuck , we fuck sheep . 
  easy mistake to make for a casual . 
  if ireland lose to england and we beat france we go to 4 in world rugby rankings meaning we wo n't be in the same rwc 2019 japan group as england , new zealand or australia . 
  is there much support in the mainland for the islands to be represented ? 
  which house is more powerful in the netherlands ? 
  also are the state parliments more powerful than the national parliment ? 
  how is the declerations done ? 
  does each counting center announce when it has finished counting and the ballots are added up nationally ? 
  ukip did something similar in 2015 , not to the same extreme and it workerd quite well for them , also a lot of manifestos are quite boring and contain a lot of filler , this was just the facts . 
  not the best but i can see why it appeals . 
  i just did a i side with dutch edition and got 51 % for d66 ( the highest ) , 49 % for the socialists and pvv and 45 % for vvd and green left . 
  what does conservative mean in the netherlands , like what are their traditional stances ? 
  ah so in each of the 12 ( ? ), 
  states have their own parliment who vote on their own representatives in the senate ? 
  do they all elect equal numbers or is it to do with size/population/wealth ?
