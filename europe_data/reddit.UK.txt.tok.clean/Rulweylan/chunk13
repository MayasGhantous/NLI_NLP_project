  that 's why i referred to the international court of justice , which has the aforementioned veto process . 
  [ here 's the relevant wikipedia page . 
  the veto is discussed under ` activities ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_court_of_justice ), 
  ` i 'm on a mission from god ' * merkel backflips up the aisle of the un , rips a harmonica solo then does the splits *, 
  it 's all right , i 've been to / r/europe before . 
  that 's fine . 
  if they veto it , then no money is paid . 
  their power to veto it is n't compromised in any way , it 's just that doing so would trigger a clause of the leaving arrangement that results in the uk paying no exit bill . 
  should help the fta negotiations along . 
  i 'd note that the vital thing to preserve , for the eu , is markets to sell things in . 
  and it sells more to the uk than to china and japan put together . 
  when the alternative is ` no deal and give us a shitload of money ' , ` no deal at all ' starts to look like the reasonable course . 
  the sensible compromise is to run trade deal negotiations alongside exit deal negotiations once an ` in principle ' deal has been hashed out on the payment . 
  the exit deal to contain a clause linking payment to passage of an fta . 
  whether those involved will choose to put the wellbeing of their citizens above pointscoring remains to be seen , of course . 
  i expect that we 'll probably end up with no deal . 
  i wonder where its unity and co-operation will be once it starts asking around for yet more money . 
  i 'm aware that 's the position the commission are taking . 
  they would presumably take the position that the world was flat if it served their purposes to do so . 
  does n't change what the treaties say , nor does it make the demand enforcable . 
  the eu can be as clear about its expectations as it likes , but unless it offers the uk some reason to meet those expectations , there 's no reason that the uk would choose to hand over a sum of money it is n't legally required to pay . 
  this is a common misunderstanding , based on the idea that the so-called exit bill has any legal basis . 
  the uk has n't agreed to pay any money while not a member of the eu . 
  if you look at the budget documents for the eu , you find that the first sentence on each is : ` having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union , and in particular article 314 thereof ' now , if we turn to article 50 ( 3 ) of that treaty , we find the procedure for leaving : ' the treaties ** shall cease to apply ** to the state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or , failing that , two years after the notification ... ' therefore , all the commitments were made within the treaties , and thus there are no commitments once the uk leaves . 
  there is no legal case for the uk to be held to commitments based on treaties that do not apply to the uk . 
  that being established , the demand for money can be more properly seen as exactly that , a demand for money , which will only be granted if something of commensurate value is offered , in this case , a trade deal . 
  the two issues are linked , if only because without a trade deal , there is no reason whatsoever for the uk to hand over any money . 
  fun bonus : if the eu took the uk to court to secure payment , and the eu somehow managed to convince that court ( the icj ) that treaties that explicitly do n't apply to the uk should apply to the uk , the uk has a veto on the enforcement of the decision by virtue of being a permanent unsc member , so even bribing the judges would n't work . 
  to be fair , this makes sense for may , since the positions on the money and citizenship bits are easy to work out . 
  we want to pay as little as possible , and we want reciprocal right to remain for residents . 
  as long as we 're doing the ` sufficient progress ' rather than ` settled deal ' thing , it 's not a problem . 
  we can agree in principle to some payments in exchange for a trade deal , as long as we 're not in a position where we are required to pay if no reasonable trade deal emerges . 
  we have planes now , it only takes about 3 and a half hours .

  do try to cheer up mate , you 'll find the world 's a nicer place if you 're less of a prick to everyone . 
  here is the entirety of our plan for that : replace the eu stars with a union flag on new plates once we leave . 
  i estimate this will require up to 1 man hour of work . 
  what is with people coming up with mental ways to house these people ? 
  seize properties , use mp 's london flats . 
  or , and i 'm just throwing it out there : rent properties that are available for rent , and while you sort that out , put them up in hotels . 
  great conspiracy theory . 
  sadly , it kind of falls down at the first hurdle , since your linked story is about how the government is defunding labour run councils , and the council responsible for this is a tory one and has been since it was created . 
  ask greece about how they treat their family . 
  [ if you watch them march , apparently their soldiers did too ] ( https://youtu.be/wyxadiayk_y?t=10 ), 
  [ this one works fine in the desert ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5f/36/e4/5f36e4df6277a6e1f0ca6cdfd06c376a.jpg ), 
  [ you should see their formation drills ] ( https://youtu.be/7-2jllmdebw?t=4 ), 
  the law does say you have to pay your bill . 
  there 's specific provisions for what happens if you do n't . 
  do you have a link to any of these documents , by the way ? 
  [ the only one i can find is this one ] ( http://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/d8e65e5d-dac0-11e5-8fea-01aa75ed71a1.0006.01/doc_1 ) , which literally begins ` having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union , and in particular article 314 thereof ' which means it does n't apply to the uk after leaving , per article 50 , so you must be talking about a different budget document . 
  is that order a separate standalone treaty , or part of the tfeu ? 
  show me where in any of the treaties we signed it says we have to pay any of this stuff once we leave . 
  ( hint , it does n't ) . 
  in fact , the only places the requirement to pay anything at all to the eu are set out are in the text of the treaties . 
  and , per article 50 clause 3 of the lisbon treaty : ` the treaties ** shall cease to apply ** to the state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or , failing that , two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2 , unless the european council , in agreement with the member state concerned , unanimously decides to extend this period . ', 
  so once we 're out , the treaties no longer apply , meaning we ca n't be required by those treaties to pay . 
  yeah , the ` bailing out french and german banks ' stage of the operation ended long ago . 
  we 're on ` seeing what can be squeezed out of the greeks while maintaining only moderate poverty ' stage now, 
  this analogy is a bit wrong . 
  imagine it like this : you sign up to a contract with a provider who says you can cancel at any time with 2 years notice . 
  they proceed to ramp up the prices until one day you quit . 
  they then tell you that since they 'd been counting on you staying for a lot longer , you have to give them the next 10 years worth of money , plus pay them for additional charges they 'd expected you to pay if there was a hurricane or earthquake in the next few years , just in case that happens . 
  upon reading your contract , you discover that there 's nothing in there that actually requires you to pay these fees if you 've cancelled the service . 
  that was rather my point . 
  canzuk is n't really an equivalent proposition to the eu . 
  canzuk is a group of roughly similarly well off countries . 
  the eu has relatively massive disparities in the wealth and living standards of its members . 
  i was more trying to get a handle on whether they 'd be cool being in a free movement bloc with countries with a minium wage in the aud $ 5.80 an hour range . 
  to be fair , a completely pointless but utterly irreconcilable disagreement over a mostly pointless distinction causing wider problems is about the most appropriate celebration of the eu possible . 
  we tried the erm , it was a massive fuckup , so we decided to stop . 
  the uk goes for a ` once bitten , twice shy ' approach whereas the eu goes for a ` we only lost a couple of fingers , maybe it 'll work if we hit the bear even harder ' approach, 
  we tried the idea of a common monetary policy . 
  it crashed and burned . 
  at that point there was a difference of opinion between the uk and the eu . 
  the uk was of the opinion that the reason for the failure was that the idea of jamming a bunch of different economies into a single monetary policy was a stupid idea , and the eu was of the opinion that the problem was that they had n't been jammed hard enough . 
  personally , i like hearing about how sad it is that i think the empire is still relevant from people who bring up the empire without any prompting to tell me that . 
  would they back free movement with somewhere like hong kong ? 
  essentially , the uk problem with the echr comes down to a couple of historical quirks . 
  first , and a major failing of this video , is that the vast majority of the rights it establishes duplicate or are outright based on prexisiting uk human rights law . 
  the places where the echr goes beyond uk law are generally the newer , more nuanced and thus more easily maligned ones . 
  the video , when it finally gets to discussing the echr after stewart has finished rehashing the ` rabid anti-eu person ' impression that has been a staple of political comedy for the decade ( stewart is an excellent dramatic actor . 
  this bit has been done , and frankly done to death , by people with more comedic talent than him ) what do they lead in with ? 
  ` the right to a fair trial ' . 
  could n't really have done worse if you 're trying to convince someone that the echr is bringing stuff to the uk . 
  the right to a trial before a jury of your peers is set down in the magna carta , making the echr about 700 or so years late to do that for the uk . 
  next a newer and more interesting one : the right to privacy . 
  interesting , but not one the echr can really stand up and say has been guaranteed for the people of europe , especially the people of the uk . 
  and from there on , we see a couple of major categories : stuff we already had and stuff we still do n't really have anyway . 
  the problem is that while , as the video acknowledges , the uk was a major factor in the authoring of the convention , the application of that convention by the court has wandered pretty widely from the text , particularly in things like the ` right to a family life ' . 
  the law has in effect evolved , and not into something many british people wholly agree with or see as consistent with what they consider fundamental rights . 
  which brings us to historical quirk number 2 : the uk , unlike the majority of europe , has n't suffered under a totalitarian regime in recent history .
