  but brits spend the most money all together , it 's huge , something like 1.9 billion euros . 
  i just read an article that said brit spending is increasing , a whopping 15 % more in 2015 than 2014 . 
  though i do n't know why you told me it is n't considered super-high spending , or per capita at all . 
  benidorm has a bad reputation in britain just as much as it does in spain . 
  it 's known as a holiday abroad for poorer/loud/annoying people . 
  i have been to many quiet and beautiful beaches in spain , ca n't remember where any of them are though . 
  i think of sean bean in sharpe walking around an arid landscape . 
  looking at the pictures it does look like uk !, 
  weird . 
  really ? 
  like the countryside and stuff ? 
  well they 're going for the weather not the culture , and you know what ? 
  i 'm fine with that . 
  plenty of brits go to spain to experience the culture too , in fact , many who go just to experience the weather and beaches sometimes go back the next year and explore more of the culture . 
  oh and we spend a * lot * of money there . 
  i do n't know why but that one mountain in the middle is annoying me . 
  beautiful picture !, 
  depends where in the lake district i guess . 
  i just think cumbria in general is my favourite county in the country . 
  though i live in a little known county called the scottish borders now and i quite like the remoteness , partly because nobodys heard of it back home . 
  [ i see this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/eildonscottsview.jpg ) from my window ( at another angle ) and can go walking all over in the summer without seeing a single tourist !, 
  nothing beats northern english countryside !, 
  the lake district , yorkshire dales , northumberland and the cheviot . 
  it feels like a viking is about to come riding over to you on a horse . 
  hah i remember that video from a long time ago . 
  where in the north did you live ? 
  i 'm going to claim [ salford , england ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdpob71rnp8 ) . 
  this is a short video walking down a street . 
  here 's some places to go if you 're ever in the `` city centre '' : [ hobb horse ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/the_hobby_horse,_leeds.jpg ) [ flemish weaver ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2007/2765057020_b34b7c9260.jpg ) [ the champion ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xlrow8yrlgq/tmst2ha2kpi/aaaaaaaaeoa/relx7p2ygyg/s1600/champion.jpg ) also , [ these flats ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4113/5432756049_8f04eeac8e_b.jpg ) are everywhere . 
  oh and i ca n't forget the land mark right in the [ city centre !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/salford_shopping_city_tower_block_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1700796.jpg ), 
  you 've never been to northern england have you ? 
  those places look quite standard to me . 
  do you have the internet ? 
  this is amazing , just think these people do n't have cars or the internet yet . 
  welsh and english are completely different , like not even in the same language family . 
  like ` house ' in dutch is ` huis ' , in welsh it 's ` t\u0177 ' . 
  `` england '' in dutch is ` engeland ' in welsh it 's ` lloegr ' . 
  i think the way we structure sentences has a big celtic influence though , apparently we do something in english other continental languages do n't . 
  germans are the dogs bollocks when it comes to most things but there 's still some `` we remember '' shit going down . 
  hah , that 's great . 
  i thought dutch and english were kinda close but clearly not , those words do n't even look alike at all , is frisian closer to dutch than english nowadays ? 
  what ? 
  chinese has different languages classed under the same one language ? 
  that 's makes it english then does n't it ? 
  to be fair it would have happened anyway . 
  why fok horses ? 
  it 's the same in uk , not sure about good night though . 
  not really religious holidays anymore , sorry to shit on your example . 
  what did he say ? 
  who ever said they want to deport little kids ? 
  a call centre job within an hour . 
  oops i meant them !, 
  do you often hear blur jokes from the british ? 
  what does this say ? 
  i 'm guessing that paragraph simply says happy new year in german ? 
  oh yeah i 've heard about that , so is that just a radio thing or is it on everywhere ? 
  also i feel a bit proud a british song is no1 in the netherlands :d, 
  it 's good for people that work on the coast and in the sea like fishing boats . 
  that 's odd , how did that happen ? 
  quite popular in the uk , i had no idea it was popular in europe . 
   hateful racist fear mongering as other countries . 
  shit mate . 
  meanwhile every left-wing paper blames every single storm or flood on climate change , like they never happened before . 
  so the swedes are far more terrified about climate change . 
  but the guardian also has an ideology . 
  you 'll find the average muslim from a muslim country is n't nearly as religious as you 'd think . 
  i know an egyptian girl and she said most of her family drink alcohol back in egypt . 
  look guys the europeans are finally realising the guardian is also full of shit !, 
  bloody hell i did n't realise it was that bad . 
  i 'm currently in a green part of scotland and it feels like it rains just as much here as it did back in manchester , but like i said it 's always much heavier in manc . 
  do you have a map like that of ireland ? 
  does ireland have no affect on stopping the rain ? 
  clearly a troll , probably not even from the uk , check his account . 
  it seems like a lot of rain dodges ireland and swoops up to the coast of western england . 
  there is a big difference with how heavy the rain is in west and east england . 
  west england gets much heavier rain and often . 
  cumbria is the wettest park of the uk and it floods all the time . 
  i 'd say this is the biggest reason , there is a big difference with the rain in west and east england , mostly because of the pennines . 
  always feels like the rain is much heavier in manchester compared to places i 've been in yorkshire . 
  wtf is going on with the green colours ? 
  it makes it very difficult . 
  who the hell put manchester in yorkshire !, 
  males are less likely to get anywhere with a humanities degree . 
  sotton or cannock . 
  ehh ? 
  if you really had to get # 150 you could . 
  if you really had to get # 150 you could . 
  you should try a british winter then , relentless wind and rain , even in the summer . 
  i met a woman from detroit who said it took her years to get used to british weather and it would make her depressed for weeks at a time . 
  i have watched every single american tv programme so ... 
  you could argue any terrorist attack in europe is done by someone mentally unstable . 
  where exactly in europe are you allowed to own a high-powered semi-automatic . 
  where you can watch someone get chopped up on tv but you ca n't look at a boob . 
  that just makes it looks like they 're doing work in the area , so ugly . 
  lol , you probably think workhouses are a good idea . 
  every time i see you comment it 's always something uttery stupid and wrong . 
  yeah because the welsh are really going to want england to win when they go out . 
  it 's never easy mode for england . 
  are you for real ?
