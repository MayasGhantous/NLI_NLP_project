tell that to greece, 
  nations do n't have friends , only interests . 
  as the anglophile subreddit you lot are , why does this surprise any of you ? 
  lol how childish is this . 
   nope , time and patience wo n't do anything about that . 
  remove all worker protection , minimum wages , paid holidays , healthcare , free education and anything that cost money that would reduce the cost of labor and devaluate your pound \u00e0 la zimbabwe might help tho . 
  who am i to argue with such hyperbole such as this ? 
  does n't feel like it on this forum . 
  uh huh , monsieur grenouille ,  from a continental perspective , 54.3 % of uk exports by value are delivered to other european trade partners while 21.2 % are sold to asian importers . 
  united kingdom ships another 16.7 % to north america and just 2.8 % to africa . 
  40 % is outside the eu , it 's a simple matter of increasing that trade whilst reducing our dependence on eu trade if it is uncompetitive to do so , just a matter of time and patience . 
  that 's all . 
  so again , does n't make me wrong . 
  still does n't make me wrong . 
  try harder frenchie . 
  that may be , but i 'm sure we 'll always be more important than slovenia , erm i mean slovakia :d, 
  and in the end , we 'll diversify our trade networks to less the burden of responsibility of the european mainland buying our products . 
  do n't worry wales , we 'll take care of ya , 
  it 's as if you 've painted the people who voted for brexit as one dimensional colonel blimps who want nothing of the future . 
  oh man , this is rich , especially coming from a romanian, 
   this completely dismantles any argument that the green revolution is the cause of no famines in india . 
  india 's was still exporting food ( as those crops were cash cows for britian 's economy ) during the late nineteenth century famines : again ; do i have to educate you in the green revolution ? 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-38156350 this jovial farmer - or mr ir8 as he became affectionately known - had inadvertently kick-started one of the greatest revolutions the world has ever seen . 
  not a political or social upheaval but a `` green revolution '' , a revolution in the way the world farmed . 
  it is thought that ir8 saved many millions of lives and transformed the lives of hundreds of millions of people . 
  ** back in the 1950s it was obvious that asia , home to half the world 's population , faced an impending food crisis . 
  ** ** rice accounts for 80 % of the calories consumed in the region and you only needed to plot population growth against rice production to see that , within a few years , there would not be enough to go around . 
  ** something needed to be done and in 1960 two american charities , the ford and rockefeller foundations , joined forces to found the international rice research institute ( irri ) in the philippines . 
  they reckoned promising developments in the science of plant breeding might just be the trick that would avert the impending disaster . 
  ** the new team began patiently cross-breeding the 10,000 different varieties they had collected . 
  this is usually a laborious process , dr gurdev singh khush tells me . 
  he is an agronomist and geneticist who joined the team that developed ir8 in 1967 . 
  from the very thing you typed ;  more population means that there is no extra food surplus , malnutrition and starvation was still very common in india before liberalization of the economy in 1991 . 
  and when there is no extra food surplus , this whole argument of increasing crop yield reducing famines falls flat in the face . 
  exactly , which indicates that if not for the increase in productivity in agriculture , you 'd of still of had famines triggered due to a rising population with a resource base unable to cope with the increase . 
  do i literally have to guide you through the reasons why the green revolution saved india from subsequent famines ? 
  the point i 'm making , which shows you do n't even bother reading the links , is that the droughts happen in india , but do n't go towards famine due to better technological development in the productiveness of agriculture which the green revolution played a large part in . 
  as for lack of fertilizer , i guess you 're just an emotional guy who does n't realise that we organised relief for famines and introduced civil codes to deal with one when they cropped up , because even from a point of self interest , it does no good for the british administrators to have regular famines occur on their watch as it is a waste of resources . 
  why would the british create a famine code with the intention not to use it . 
  as it states in the text , it was the ** first ** modern reactions to famines in india . 
  taken literally from the link i sent you , did you bother to read it ? 
  the green revolution in india was a period when ** agriculture in india increased its yields due to improved agronomic technology ** green revolution allowed developing countries , like india , to overcome poor agricultural productivity . 
  it started in india in the early 1960s and led to an increase in food grain production , especially in punjab , haryana and uttar pradesh during the early phase . 
  the main development was higher-yielding varieties of wheat , which were developed by many scientists , including american agronomist dr. norman borlaug , indian geneticist m. s. swaminathan , and others . 
  the indian council of agricultural research also claims credit for enabling the green revolution , [ 1 ] in part by developing rust resistant strains of wheat . 
  [ 2 ] ** the introduction of high-yielding varieties of seeds and the increased use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation led to the increase in production needed to make the country self-sufficient in food grains , thus improving agriculture in india . 
  [ 3 ] the methods adopted included the use of high-yielding varieties ( hyvs ) of seeds [ 4 ] with modern farming methods . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_famine_codes the indian famine codes , developed by the colonial british in the 1880s , were one of the earliest famine scales . 
  the famine codes defined three levels of food insecurity : near-scarcity , scarcity , and famine . 
  `` scarcity '' was defined as three successive years of crop failure , crop yields of one-third or one-half normal , and large populations in distress . 
  `` famine '' further included a rise in food prices to above 140 % of `` normal '' , the movement of people in search of food , and widespread mortality . 
  [ 1 ] ** in order to address the issues of famine in india they created an indian famine commission to create ways to prevent and avoid future famine in india . 
  [ 1 ] so in 1880 the secretary of commission wrote a draft of the indian famine code . 
  this famine code became the basis of famine prevention until the 1970s . 
  ** more famine codes were created after the indian famine codes ( bihar ) but they addressed similar ideas that the indian one did , the indian famine code was the foundation of multiple famine codes / scales . 
  famine codes and scales measure the intensity and magnitude of the famine . 
  [ 2 ] this famine code was one of the first attempts to predict famine , and by predicting it , prevent it . 
  ** when the british created these ` indian famine codes ' they were the first modern reaction to the famines in india . 
  ** the codes classified food scarcity on a scale of intensity and had steps that governments were required to take to mitigate the risk of famine . 
  because of the green revolution ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_revolution_in_india take note ; ** frequent famines famines in india were very frequent during the period 1940s to 1970s . 
  due to faulty distribution of food , and because farmers did not receive the true value for their labour , the majority of the population did not get enough food . 
  [ 6 ] malnutrition and starvation was a huge problem **, 
  because unfortunately , that 's the underlying sentiment from most mainland euros . 
  lol@your butt hurts, 
  did n't get it , did you ? 
  where as you did n't join at all . 
  lol with that logic , we 're responsible for wwii !, 
  and you wonder why le pen is polling high with comments like yours . 
  no they did n't asshole, 
  lol pretty rich coming from a hapsburg remnant, 
  piss the english off like the english piss off the germans, 
  should be an automatic life sentence , that 'll deter most . 
  ah the independent newspaper , or as i term it , the respectable face of buzzfeed . 
  i found the guy !, 
  just gon na dump this here from a previous poster * home secretary is such a poisoned chalice in general . 
  * * last person to manage 6 years was james chuter ede in 1945 . 
  still * plenty * of those voters who want their pensions guaranteed . 
  how do you know ? 
  share us your unverified facts . 
  we 've never considered the referendums a joke . 
  it 's the fact we 're so integrated which is what will make it so difficult . 
  we 've seen the furore over us leaving the eu and we 've been there for 40 years , now imagine that with scotland , having been with them 7\u00a01/2 times longer . 
  the point i 'm making is that in comparison , the union between the czechs and slovaks was of less time and importance than between england and scotland . 
  but the pm acts as pm of the uk , you get representation for ni affairs , as does scotland and wales for their affairs , where as england takes a hit in its representation as it is the main body for legislation for the whole of the uk . 
  it 's not fear mongering if it 's actually what 's going to happen if they left . 
  why was n't it absolutely the case ? 
  it clearly ( at the time ) would of been the case as the uk was firmly within the eu . 
  scottish mps can vote on laws which affect english voters , but this is n't applied vice versa . 
  the scot pm was a point in case as they have shared ruling the uk , where as with your country no irish catholic would ever of been pm when it was part of the uk . 
  that 's real inequality . 
  they 're already equals , hate to break it to you , but we 've had scottish prime ministers before , and they have a beneficial relationship which means they get better funding than other nations in the union . 
  ireland was different , there was genuine oppression and disenfranchisement , it 's not like that for scotland whatsoever . 
  fuckin ' tired of this false equivalence . 
  what 's the calculation of the deficit reduction if we got rid of scotland ? 
  clowns come and go , this wo n't . 
  exactly , they complain about tories now , if they have a stranglehold on the ruk then this is the type of thing they will do to appeal to their base . 
  that 's not fear mongering , as like the eu is going to show to the uk , we would show to the scots that not being part of the union is detrimental to them , it would be unfair to just lie about that and convince them otherwise . 
  tl ; dr a good friend stabs you in the front . 
  no it 's not , it 's undone by the snp . 
  no it was n't , it was based on a rationale that us being together for 300 odd years was better than being split and divided along ethnic lines , you know , something the remain campaign ( which also had government backing ) also emphasized .
