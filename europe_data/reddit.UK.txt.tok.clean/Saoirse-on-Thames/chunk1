goes great with some apple juice . 
  last time i ordered it the barman added some mint , not sure if that 's a thing or not . 
  shame , [ because it can sound really beautiful ] ( https://soundcloud.com/emmanifhioruiscemusic/rafla-heard-it-through-the ) . 
  could well be an incentive for others though . 
  he also chose pence as his running mate . 
  poland 's contribution to the esa was $ 30m, 
  interesting read thank you for sharing . 
  it also linked to this - http://ec.europa.eu/translation/english/guidelines/documents/misused_english_terminology_eu_publications_en.pdf - which i 'm definitely going to be using as a guide in the future ... 
  just to address on the war bill , that was vetoed , as you 've mentioned it a second time . 
  it was proposed by the anti-war mp tam dalyell and would `` require the prior approval , by a simple majority of the house of commons , of military action by british forces against iraq . '', 
  as we both know , iraq was not a success , and it could have been prevented under proper scrutiny . 
  parliament should not be bypassed , as it ignores the people 's representation . 
  hitler did n't win the popular vote , but thanks for going all godwin so fast ? 
  http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/l-hitlerdemo.htm also , how do you know the monarch and their eldest child has ` independent advisors ' that instruct them on how to vote ? 
  can you imagine how charles is going to react to an anti-homeopathy bill ? 
  is that going to be stopped by these advisors ? 
  they 've got a great delivery and returns policy if you sign up for ` premier ' . 
  i exclusively shop in the ` outlet ' and get lots of clothes at a decent price . 
  how does the monarchy interpret the ` will of the people ' when there presumably has already been free and fair elections . 
  there is absolutely no accountability here . 
  i hope you 're not being serious about hereditary monarchy being a divine right . 
  also it * is * only a subsection of stuff being signed off , but my point is that why would they then decide to focus on bills like this ? 
  it 's clearly a personal interest , and not something they 're doing to prevent theresa may from snooping or anything which could harm our liberties . 
  i do n't find the argument that because something 's been done for a long while it 's still okay . 
  we would n't have parliament with that attitude . 
  and the idea that it 's just to stop elected leaders gaining too much power is ridiculous - why then would they have sought consent on everything from the marine navigation aids bill ( 2009-10 ) and gambling bill ( 2004-05 for prince charles and the high hedges act or civil partnership act for the queen ? 
  the idea that the queen can act as a check on politicians may be comforting , but it 's a fantasy . 
  the opposite is true - the monarchy gives huge power to politicians . 
  there is simply no constitutional mechanism by which the queen could stop a potential dictator , other than by becoming one herself . 
  the greatest safeguard against tyranny is a culture of active citizenship and a political system with clear rules based on equal rights , transparency and accountability -- values to which monarchy is directly opposed . 
  that would be the reasonable assumption , but it does n't sound any better . 
  whatever their intentions are , they should n't in my opinion have a role in the legislative process . 
  maybe football !, 
  xd not sure calling british people similar is too controversial . 
  to me the story of britain and its constituent nations is one of individuals making great scientific advances and medical discoveries , providing strong leadership at times of crisis and making outstanding contributions to art and literature . 
  it is also the story of large numbers of people joining together to fight for greater representation , better conditions and equal rights . 
  it would be great to have a song which could unite us through our achievements . 
  there 's consistently between 20-25 % of people who would abolish the monarchy under elizabeth ( who is under all things considered a good monarch ) . 
  this is higher in places like scotland . 
  i 'm not talking about uniting as in conquest or acts of union but in the sense that it fosters a shared national identity . 
  oh , you were talking about i vow to thee . 
  was n't aware of those issues , i must admit i 'm not sure of how controversial it being used in remembrance ceremonies and wars will be . 
  god save the queen ( both versions ) has a specific political message though , and does n't really say anything about our country . 
  it 's also not just about people being offended - the whole purpose of an anthem is that it 's supposed to * unite * us . 
  from the telegraph : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9801835/queen-and-prince-charles-using-power-of-veto-over-new-laws-whitehall-documents-reveal.html, 
  would you be in favour of a less divisive anthem being played ? 
  like this https://youtu.be/bvouc8qs_mi, 
  might be something to do with your anthem not sounding like a funeral march ... also , the british anthem is divisive for political and religious reasons besides . 
  there 's a thirty year gap after the rock music comment , plenty to dig up there i 'm sure . 
  very http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/population/demo/per-itog/tab5.xls check out the american section, 
  some punitive laws , hopefully being repealed soon http://www.solarpowereurope.org/newsletter-april-2016/our-news/unef-spain-set-to-remove-sun-tax/, 
   `` while politicians can deny reality , a shampoo produced on the continent is now more expensive , '' he said . 
  `` this is n't about tesco or unilever , but about all uk retailers and suppliers . '', 
  a bit scathing from the former tesco exec, 
  this reminds me of when i lived in russia after the sanctions hit . 
  good thing i do n't care much for marmite anyway . 
  maybe there are certain data protection requirements that the gov ' t would want to circumvent ? 
  we did well in the olympics !, 
  and , uh , ... ca n't think of much else right now, 
  i did n't realise the armenian influence stretched so far . 
  also interesting how latin names stayed in the interior . 
  it 's not something that 's a big enough deal to impact consumers noticeably . 
  you can see here that swissgrid talk about their partnership with epex and how they need to implement eu regulations before they can fully access market coupling https://www.swissgrid.ch/swissgrid/en/home/reliability/power_market/market_coupling.html there 's some more technical information in german but i do n't understand the language . 
  looks like they do n't have electricity http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/show/all/2716/2014/ ( fair enough ) they do have gas ( and they count different states eg gaseous/liquefied ! ) . 
  see here for where the nl exports piped gas to for example http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/nld/show/271121/2014/, 
  specific interest of mine  i 'm also interested in how brexit might affect the continuation of this if discussions get heated . 
  see for example how switzerland were explicitly written out of some legislation on cross-border electricity flows here - http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a32015r1222, 
  does the data include cross-border gas and electricity flows ? 
  thank you :d, 
  check the fifth paragraph , the security guard was carrying a weapon so was not likely to have been a french private security guard . 
  i 'm proud of the typography  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lzkqdhma3u1vwia4druyaecqfvxsu_sacb-stpy2lv8/edit#slide=id.g17e79607c_023, 
  i think a lot of the importing problems could be solved by reconsidering the heat sector !, 
  * armenia does n't have a lot of natural resources . 
  * concerns after chernobyl and local protests forced a political decision to be made on the closure of metsamor npp * following independence and nuclear shutdown armenia heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels * tensions with neighbours led to severe energy shortages that caused poverty , suffering , destruction of industrial sector , emigration ... * between 1991 & 1996 people suffered through several of armenia 's harsh winters with little more than two hours of electricity supply per day . 
  * recommissioned nuclear was seen as key step to get out of energy crisis in '90s . 
  * crisis experience changed views on npp , still positive even after fukushima . 
  these are the tidbits i wanted to share because i thought they were interesting . 
  i 'm not sure why you thought i was trying to cause any tensions . 
  i understand that relations in this part of the world are a sensitive issue , and i realise now you might be from that region , but i do n't care about the tensions right now - i work in energy and i am purely interested in how the decisions are linked , in armenia , to the country 's narratives on regional issues and domestic history . 
  i think people also do n't understand the energy crisis armenia went through in the early '90s before the npp was recommissioned . 
  yes i did read the article , with interest , i 'm not sure how you thought i did n't by what i wrote as i checked to make sure the context i was giving was n't already in the article . 
  metsamor is also in an earthquake prone zone , which could be more of a concern than terrorist attacks . 
  it is important to bear in mind the contribution metsamor npp makes to armenian energy security , because it shows that the government is unlikely to want to shut it down without some alternate source of power . 
  i actually presented a paper on armenian energy security to a russian university in may 2015 . 
  if anybody 's interested i 'll upload the slides , good sources were hard to come by as i did n't have a good enough grasp of armenian or russian . 
  it 's worth bearing in mind that this nuclear power plant supplies around 40 % of armenia 's power iirc . 
  energy security is a big deal in armenia as there were a history of economically devastating blackouts which many attribute to turkish and azeri actions . 
  they 're a landlocked country between two neighbours that do n't have fond feelings for them but with narrow connections to russia and iran , and one of the reasons they have such a low usage of oil in transport ( they use compressed gas instead ) is because of the this . 
  edit : check this comment at the bottom of the thread for info about safety https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54soyp/armenian_nuclear_plant_should_be_shut_down_turkey/d84qylc, 
  i do n't know much spanish but i think they were trying to reply to a comment, 
  i do n't know enough about norway to dispute that . 
  however , in the uk there are calls to reintroduce wolves to recreate behaviours in deer that protected forestry , conservation efforts , and farming . 
  paul lister , [ a commercial forester and conservationist says ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11566555/bring-on-a-few-more-apex-predators.html ) : & gt ; wolves , like the lynx , could provide an efficient and natural means of controlling deer populations . 
  high deer numbers have a significant economic and ecological effect because they compete with livestock for grazing and impede attempts to re-forest , thereby reducing bird densities . 
  predators would reduce the financial burden of costly deer culls and so would help reach scotland 's deer commission target of six deer per square kilometre . 
  but there is still the challenge of making this vision to restore a native highland ecosystem economically viable . 
  in england , flooding is regularly caused [ by a lack of biodiversity ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/deluge-farmers-flood-grouse-moor-drain-land ) as soil becomes ( like in the video in my previous comment ) more unstable and less able to hold water . 
  to back up your argument with the experience in america - https://youtu.be/ysa5obhxz-q ( you can skip the first 25 seconds ), 
  originally posted a buzzfeed article that summarised the whole debacle ( without using any gifs , thankfully ) but i found out today that the site is banned on / r/europe . 
  the article is titled `` ukip 's mp is arguing with scientists about what causes tides '' if anybody wants to search for it .
