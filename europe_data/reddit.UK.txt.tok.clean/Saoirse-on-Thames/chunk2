  also , who upvoted this , was it approved ? 
  more feasible to just pop a pill every day . 
  those people are my worst enemies , as someone with mild asthma . 
  10 minutes late !, 
  i think there 's a kind of humour in the style of reporting here - the photo of them looking a bit distant at who knows what , the almost biblical story of them coming across two fisherman , description of the weather and wavelets . 
  it 's light hearted sunday reading , maybe even tongue in cheek if you read too much into it . 
  hopefully people do n't skip this because it looks pro-russia , because they 're missing out on a chuckle in my opinion . 
  alexander lebedev , his dad , is more so . 
  lebedev has used his editorial influence in the uk to [ promote russia as an ally ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=lebedev+putin&amp;oq=lebedev+putin&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.1751j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8#q=evgeny+lebedev+putin&amp;tbm=nws ) , and to [ diminish its social problems ] ( http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/03/17/evening-standard-owner-evgeny-lebedev-russia-homophobic-country-im-gay/ ) . 
  if he were doing all that he does now , * and * living in russia , i 'd definitely class him as anti-putin . 
  all the major actors of the world wars are well known , including anzac . 
  one thing i have noticed is that most english people seem to think that northern ireland is legally part of the republic ... 
  some things like the olympics are n't covered by the barnett formula though , are they ? 
  i 'd guess that the rural lower population density of scotland could mean higher spending , probably in between wales and northern ireland . 
  at the same time , scotland contributes more than these two countries/regions . 
  this would also mean that the south east has the lowest spending per head . 
  i 'm on mobile right now but could look for a source tonight if you doubt me ? 
  either way , yes more complicated than most people think . 
  according to the statistics 9.1 % of tax revenue came from scotland in 2012/13 , with a population of 8.3 % . 
  if you exclude scotland 's oil it 's still 8.2 % , so i do n't really feel that my tax money is going to subsidise scotland . 
  source : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-28879267, 
  how does the rest of the u.k. suffer ? 
  in economic terms or what ? 
  london subsidises the rest of the u.k. , and nearly a third of tax is paid from it . 
  the issue here are graduates from other cities moving to london , but if you want a relatively free market i 'm not sure how much can be done about that . 
  hopefully the government tries to reform farming subsidies too , though if leadsom is still head of defra when that comes round i 'm not hopeful . 
  from what i understand this could be true to some extent . 
  at least according to a professor i had , the british negotiated in the sykes-picot agreement for strategic resources such as oil , whilst the french did the same for land . 
  this could be completely wrong though . 
  not sure your post was downvoted to negative but this is interesting , albeit disturbibg . 
  in case people want to read slightly beyond the headline :  the report , `` you do n't exist , '' documented prolonged , arbitrary , and sometimes secret detention as well as ill-treatment of detainees by both ukrainian authorities and russia-backed separatists . 
  ukraine 's military prosecutor should prioritize and personally oversee an investigation into grave allegations of secret detention by the sbu . 
   in the two weeks after the report 's publication , 13 people -- 12 men and one woman -- were released from secret detention in the kharkiv sbu . 
  i thought they were from a non - $ uro country like poland and they were just converting their currency into dollars for simplicity 's sake . 
  i probably would 've assumed they were american elsewhere but not in / r/europe . 
  this happens on / r/actuallesbians a lot too . 
  except that the fundamental nature of a slaughterhouse is to slaughter meat ( in most cases non-halal ) and the fundamental nature of a pub is to serve alcohol . 
  the fundamental nature of the police is n't to wear a single , specific style , of uniform with no opportunity for variation according to the officer 's needs . 
  you can have uniformity with variations , that 's why a mixed school can have ' a school uniform ' with gendered differences . 
  in the army you can have different uniforms also . 
  if this argument is really down to semantics for you ( which i doubt it is ) , uniform as an adjective can also mean consistency - something that these religious variations do have in line with the default uniform . 
  what 's home depot ? 
  also with it skills you could always use the free movement to go somewhere else in the eu that requires it , although i understand the need to not leave the country you grew up in . 
  with an ma in finance she 's probably overqualified for a lot of jobs , so the key thing to get is work experience . 
  why ? 
  it 's not a threat to them , unlike a gas pipeline . 
  do you never wake up needing to pee ? 
  it 's weird because i lived in russia for a year and was keeping an eye out and never saw anybody squat like this ( though i saw plenty of gopniks ) . 
  also went to poland for a week and did n't catch anybody squatting . 
  is it common among expats , or is this more of a historical joke ? 
  you should request a special flair from the mods !, 
  or , in typical british mettle , a plan to move europe further away from us  , 
  we 're talking about the media profiling him as white . 
  so imagine this photo is poorer quality and at a fair distance . 
  i was n't being sarcastic . 
  you missed the word ` in ' , which is a pain to wedge into a sentence that does n't nee d it ,,

   their cowardly , easily scared persons will change ; acknowledge that is a problem with * in * some of them . 
  / u/nejc504 must be saying that we should n't change our ways because of attacks like this .

  they could just learn the russian way of saying the mcdonald 's menu if it 's a common occurrence ? 
   christians claiming being in danger of oppresion were they all christians or were some political asylum seekers ? 
  thanks !, 
  and yes it 's an easy enough mistake to make so no probs , 
   weekend trips are immensely popular in europe with budget airline carriers like easyjet and ryanair offering rock-bottom prices . 
  but they also threaten to destroy the local character and traditions , as cities like barcelona and venice have discovered .

  [ here 's a report on finland 's energy efficiency ] ( http://www.odyssee-mure.eu/publications/national-reports/energy-efficiency-finland.pdf ) if you 're interested . 
  you can also [ see the iea 's report ] ( https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/finland2013_free.pdf ) ( p39 on ) as finland has been a member since the 90s . 
  the article is about energy efficiency , which is slightly different than overall % of renewable electricity . 
  the energy efficiency rankings had four categories - national efforts , buildings , industry , and transportation . 
  based [ on this report from 2015 ] ( http://www.odyssee-mure.eu/publications/national-reports/energy-efficiency-portugal.pdf ) , i 'd say you 're doing quite well anyway . 
  some highlights :  - reduction of primary energy by about 14,8 % in 2013 compared to 2000 ;  - lower energy dependence : from 88,8 % in 2005 to 73,9 % in 2013 ;  - in 2013 , 24,7 % of total primary energy consumption came from renewable sources ;  - the primary and final energy intensities ( at m $ 2011 ) in 2013 , compared to 2000 , decreased by  15,4 % and 16,6 % , respectively ;  - co2 emissions from fossil fuels decreased by 18,2 % compared to 2000 ;  - in terms of final energy consumption , the oil products in 2013 accounted for 48,0 % ( compared to  59,7 % in 2000 . 
  on the other hand , the consumption of electricity increased from 18,2 % in 2000 to  25,6 % in 2013 ;  - the transport sector in 2013 wasthe largest consumer of energy ( 36 % ) , followed by industry ( 32 % ) ;  - the energy intensity of the transport sector , base in 2011 year price , decreased by about 0,6 % ,  between 2000 and 2013 ;  - the tendency for energy consumption in the services sector is to grow since 2000 , representing  12 % of total energy consumption in 2013 ;  - the energy consumption of the household sector in 2013 represents 17 % of total final energy  consumption . 
  this sector was the one with the biggest gains in terms of energy efficiency ( 35,6 % ) ;  - concerning the neeap the accumulated energy savings until 2013 are equivalent to 942.332 toe ,  representing an accomplishment of 63 % of the 2016 target . 
    taking account the same comparative years ( 2010-2013 ) both , primary energy consumption and final  energy consumption reduce , respectively by 6,9 % and 14,3 % . 
  similarly , the four main activity sectors  decrease their energy consumption :  - road fuels consumption by 16,1 % ;  - industry performed the highest drop with 17,8 % ;  - household presented a diminish by 11,3 % and services , with a lower impact , decreased by 5,7 % ;  - overall , electricity consumption reduced by 9,3 % mainly due to residential sector ( -15,2 % ) , yet  followed by industry ( -8,9 % ) and services ( -4,6 % ) . 
  in 2014 year , the macroeconomic indicators  presented a slight positive trend than in 2013 , according to the foreseen data . 
  it looks like this woman did n't really have a choice , but your comment reminded me of this famous photograph of an armenian woman during the nagarno-karabakh war http://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/751/0075187.html, 
  you can see the rationale here - http://aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdf/country/2016/germany.pdf germany [ still has a fairly high energy consumption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_energy_consumption_per_capita ) , but the * energy efficiency * measures it is implementing ( which is what this report is about ) have been quite successful . 
  energy efficiency in this context means using less energy to provide the same service , not total energy consumption . 
  read the uk 's scorecard for example and you 'll see what i mean - http://aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdf/country/2016/uk.pdf your comment is misleading as it implies that eu states have a low energy use when their [ actual energy consumption per capita for europe is still very high ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_energy_consumption_per_capita ) and it also might mislead people into thinking that the energy efficiency report is about energy consumption . 
  it would have been under green belt planning laws http://planningguidance.communities.gov.uk/blog/policy/achieving-sustainable-development/delivering-sustainable-development/9-protecting-green-belt-land/ also if they let this case fly , then everyone else will try and do the same thing . 
  oh that makes a lot of sense , thank you . 
  google had it as `` all the way here '' . 
   alle weg hier do you know what that means ? 
  cnn also , i believed they phoned a kosovar muslim woman . 
  could it have been someone running away saying that ? 
  either way , i 'll wait until confirmation from the police . 
  could it be that religious people from rural areas have moved to urban areas and are able to demonstrate and organise better etc ?
