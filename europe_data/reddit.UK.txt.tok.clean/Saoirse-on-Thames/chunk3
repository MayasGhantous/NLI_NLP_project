  even if they were a liberal democratic county with a working economy then they 'd still face the cypriot veto , and the greek veto given their history . 
  same with the british fco . 
  what is it like for transgender people ? 
  what they could also do is convert their coal plants into biomass , which has very low lifecycle emissions even if you import the fuel from the baltics/north america and obviously counts as renewable for the 2020 targets . 
  i 'm not sure if nuclear counts under the 2020 targets , but this is a good option for a ( rich ) high density country with little land for other low carbon forms of generation . 
  best place to start though would be switching from coal to gas like the uk is . 
  good luck getting greek and cyprus not to veto though : s, 
  [ there is a really interesting british libel case on holocaust denial where a man tried to sue a historian for calling him a racist \\ ( or something along those lines \\ ) . 
  ] ( http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/ )  judge gray found that irving had `` for his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence '' in order to portray hitler `` in an unwarrantedly favourable light '' particularly in his treatment of the jews . 
  irving had `` significantly '' misrepresented , misconstrued , omitted , mistranslated , misread and applied double standards to the historical evidence in order to achieve his ideological presentation of history . 
  judge gray also found that irving was an `` active holocaust denier ; that he is anti-semitic and racist , and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-nazism . '', 
  i mean , we have libel courts , and i do n't know many people who would be against a law discouraging others from shouting ' * fire !, 
  * ' in a crowded theatre . 
  it just depends on where you draw the line . 
  the argument is that denial of a genocide that is backed up so strongly by historical fact is a method of inciting racial violence . 
  many countries do n't have a crime of holocaust denial but prosecute people for this [ on the grounds of inciting racial hatred ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial ) . 
  edit : of course i get downvoted ( -5 ) for giving a bare bones explanation of why laws like this have been made . 
  just because you disagree with something that should n't mean you should try and hide the explanation from others . 
  i was just addressing you saying it was n't illegal because there does seem to be a bit of a grey area in the way turkey 's laws are applied . 
  and i do n't know what turkey was like ten years ago , but all the turks i 've met and had a chance to talk to about the genocide , have not tried to deny or trivialise it . 
  all the azeris i 've talked to have though !, 
   and this is the amazing irony . 
  in turkey it is not illlegal to say the genocide happened . 
  this appears to be the most common law used to silence genocide history https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_301_ ( turkish_penal_code ) hrant dink ( a journalist ) is the most famous person prosecuted under this law , being given a 6 month suspended sentence in 2006 and subsequently assassinated by radical nationalists for writing about the genocide . 
  [ his son was later given a 1-year suspended sentence for printing his dead father 's claims that the killing of armenians by ottoman turks from 1915 was genocide ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7040171.stm ) . 
  is that because they call gaelic football , football ? 
  it was meant to be a joke :(, 
   i just went for wanting england to hurt ... ( i 'm english born and bred btw ) is that how you voted in the referendum as well ? 
  found a source http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/25/brexit-live-emergency-meetings-eu-uk-leave-vote#comment-77205935, 
  i have no doubt that leave would probably get a higher majority if we voted again , but it would really smooth things over if we at least got a clear majority http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nigel-farage-wants-second-referendum-7985017, 
  i 've had some good things from them . 
  own brand somewhere between new look and h&m for quality . 
  you can sometimes get good finds on brand sales . 
  their returns are a hassle ( especially if you 're not in london ) but it 's free unlike amazon, 
  it 's an online fashion store . 
  i love it because they 've got a good range , run a lot of different sizes , and you can buy next day delivery/click & collect for a tenner a year . 
  ahh , thanks . 
  do they get a vote ? 
  spain were dominating and czechia lasted till the 87th minute , they deserve to get through based on that imo , 
  if brexit happens i 'd really want to leave the uk , but i do n't speak any second languages well enough , and my field is policy/comms so it 's not something that is just in demand anywhere regardless of my language abilities . 
  so yeah , i 'm voting to remain and urging my friends to do the same : /, 
  do n't know about sweden but in russia , they put it on literally everything . 
  i actually liked it before i went over .

  it took me too long to realise that you were joking , your flair has a reputation for litigation , 
  i hope this guy does n't beat his wife ( if he has one ) also . 
  what do you think of the syrian food they showed in the article ? 
  i 've never had syrian cuisine but i love the lebanese restaurants they have in london because there 's a lot of different influences ( armenian , french , etc. 
  ... ) so i have some hopes . 
  also depends if the per capita is just for adult population or not . 
  i mean , i know children drink wine in france and such , but they ca n't match a fully-grown adult . 
  george monbiot is a good person to follow on this , he does paint a convincing picture of rewilding based on past projects ( e.g. 
  pine martens in ireland ) - http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/16/britain-wild-nature-rewilding-ecosystems-heal-lives, 
  khan is very distant from livingstone within the party , and he immediately called for his expulsion from the party when the livingstone incident happened . 
  however , [ there is speculation that the incident might have affected the election ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-36203311 ) . 
  and no , there is n't anything inherently antisemitic about criticising israel , but there it sure looks antisemitic when you misrepresent what happened in the holocaust to score political points against a predominately jewish state - which is what he did . 
  / r/askhistorians had [ a thread on livingstone 's claims ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/4h45ia/the_ken_livingstone_what_was_hitlers_relation_to/ ) . 
  could also just be a product of cultural exchange within the narrow visa requirements , 
  i hope this leads to more georgian food across europe, 
   i notice a lot of stuff we invent tends to end up with us getting the shit end of the stick regardless like sports games . 
  i mean , we deliberately made cricket inaccessible , and even then we barely have a chance of winning at it . 
  more developed countries will be better placed to identify artefacts, 
  europe is a continental landmass or geographical area . 
  europe is also a loose group of countries with shared liberal and social democratic values like universal healthcare , unbundling , lgbt rights , maternity leave , and so on . 
  we 're very much a part of both of these definitions . 
  the european union , which we 're still a part of currently , is a pooling of sovereignty between different countries for harmonised standards and collective free movement of trade and people . 
  we do n't yet know if our position will be partially in or fully out of that , but we will always be close and have shared values . 
  if they respond , they get banned from t_d , and are then no longer part of t_d, 
   it sounded like `` kakakaka kakaa kaaka kakakaka '' . 
  sounds like shit to me, 
  you said that the kgb founded the green movement . 
  to back that up , you linked a 1983 article about a failed attempt by the kgb to join groups that would block deployment of medium-range missiles in western europe . 
  you also linked to a blog post from 2009 that also talked about the peace movement . 
   yes , but today - with exception of hydro-energy ( and its limited ) , none are economically viable and only exist due to gigantic subsidies nuclear is not bankable . 
  no nuclear plant is currently being built in any free market without massive state support . 
   to remove nuclear and fosil energy complete would make europe un-competive less competitive , but not necessarily uncompetitive . 
  it also would n't make sense to remove existing nuclear before the end of its lifetime as the majority of the cost is in construction . 
  i agree that the consultation would have limited effect . 
  the way i see it , this is simply a procedural thing that someone forgot about . 
   i hate irrational environmentalists !, 
  and i guess guardian is one of them . 
  they attack nuclear energy but allow fossil energy ( coal , petroleum , gas ) that are a magnitude more damaging to the environment the first five paragraphs of the article were just reporting on events . 
  there is one paragraph of greenpeace , which is followed by two from edf which has a stake in the project 's construction . 
  i do n't see how the remaining four paragraphs say anything irrational or biased against nuclear/pro-hydrocarbons . 
   the green movement in europe was created by kgb in the 70 and its biggest supporters are today the mohammedan oil theocracies in the middle east the green movement had its roots in the 19th century when cities with extreme air and chemical pollution . 
  throughout the 20th century we began to understand more about how our actions could affect the environment , following chemical accidents , acid rain , 3 mile island/chernobyl , aerosols etc. 
  i have not seen any evidence that the kgb ` founded ' the green movement . 
  i also have not seen any evidence that the biggest supporters of the green movement are oil-rich muslim countries from the middle east . 
   who knows that currently the only alternative to oil and gasoline is nuclear energy in combination with battery/fuel cell cars this is * one * alternative . 
  there are a huge number of different ways to decarbonise , with advantages/disadvantages on the energy trilemma . 
  there were international objections to sellafield , with norway finding that radioactive materials can be transported to norwegian coasts . 
  see here for some examples https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sellafield#irish_objections this is how wind carried radiation from the chernobyl disaster https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu4_bjt8w3y tl ; dr radioactive stuff can move with ocean currents or the wind and deposit many miles away . 
  this can cause health problems to wildlife or people, 
  not sure why it 's this date specifically and not later in the week . 
   ** theresa may is to trigger the two-year article 50 eu exit process on march 29 .
