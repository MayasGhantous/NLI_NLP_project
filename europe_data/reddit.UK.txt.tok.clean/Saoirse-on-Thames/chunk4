    mr tusk is expected to respond formally within 48 hours but a detailed eu negotiating position is not expected to emerge until later in the spring . 
    the pre-announcement of the timing of the article 50 letter is partly aimed at preparing financial markets for the formal start of the brexit process which will last at least two years . 
    downing st has been anxious in recent months to counter the risk that major brexit announcements are inevitably accompanied by falls in the value of the pound . 
    sterling is trading at a three-week high against the dollar at $ 1.2410 this morning . 
  yes , i just saw that nobody had mentioned research funding when i commented which is a part of this . 
  i imagine a part of this is research funding . 
  the uk for instance gets a lot more back than it puts in because we have a lot of academics who are able to win competitive funding . 
  also , in a spin on the ` it 's tradition , we 've been doing it forever ' argument ... pretty much any way that someone could influence a paper ballot has been tried over hundreds of years . 
  we know all the techniques . 
  with bespoke voting software this is much less certain . 
  funny , perhaps apocryphal , story about armenia and turkey during the cold war . 
  turkey requested that the armenian ssr removes references to mount ararat in their national symbols , as it was not in armenian territory . 
  a soviet official then requested that turkey remove references to the moon .

  you best ask the person who created it https://mobile.twitter.com/matamix/status/456755878411005952/photo/1, 
  x-post from / r/map _ porn , via / u/big _ al11 - this is the [ source ] ( http://tumblr.mapsbynik.com/post/83033311727/france-edition-nobody-lives-here-this-is-not-a ) :  based on population data from insee , it shows the parts of metropolitan france where people do n't live . 
  like the u.s. map , terrain plays a big role in determining where people settle . 
  for instance , the roughness of alps ( southeast ) and the pyrenees ( southwest ) mountains , prevents habitation . 
  on the southern atlantic coast , forestation acts as an impediment to human living in aquitaine . 
    the vast expanse of `` uninhabited '' land in the northeast ( burgundy , champagne-ardenne ) is a bit of a mystery . 
  much of it is arable land and likely covered in agriculture , especially on the side near paris . 
  but brittany and pays-de-la-loire are also prime agricultural land . 
  so why do we see such different settlement patterns between the regions ? 
    perhaps someone more familiar with the geography of france can clue me in . 
  i 'd appreciate it . 
    update : jedo52 explained to me that the regions did not share agricultural practices historically . 
  brittany and the northwest are traditionally covered in a bocage landscape where housing is dispersed in many hamlets . 
  in the east however , farm fields are more open with housing more concentrated into villages . 
    finally , the numbers . 
  france checks in at about 32 % unoccupied compared to 47 % in the u.s. 
  considering the higher population density in france , it 's not surprising that the country is `` less empty '' of humanity . 
    in any event , [ @matamix 's map ] ( https://twitter.com/matamix/status/456755878411005952/photo/1 ) is a great contribution to the discussion of where people are n't . 
   how will it ever be sensible for the conscripts to be anything beyond the least specialised roles ? 
  they could be useful as reserves , though this would be more effective with a few weeks regular training every year . 
  this may have to change if finland ever stops including sterility as a requirement for changing your legal gender . 
  ~ ~ she , but ~ ~ thanks !, 
  i 'm not comparing the here and the now . 
  ireland used to be very conservative up until relatively recent which was partly to do with its catholicism , and poland is fairly conservative still which is partly to do with its catholicism . 
  my point is that you did n't used to be liberal on those issues , but now are . 
  ireland used to be extremely conservative , due to the catholic influence . 
  homosexuality was only decriminalised in the 90s , at least partly because the criminalisation was . 
  i made a comparison because they are both very catholic countries , except ireland had very rapid social change . 
  ireland made it , poland can too !, 
  give them time , 
  could be landfill/hydrogen gas . 
  the source is from a wind energy group , which is the answer to a lot of your questions . 
  this is true , it also leaves us with our hands tied somewhat as we have to predict power demand decades in advance and are left with a much less dispatchable/flexible network . 
  i think we should really focus on hydrogen and biogas research , as we 're so invested into our gas network and need to explore how we can lower emissions from it whilst maintaining a good price ( i 'd estimate low-carbon alternatives are ~ 2-3x more expensive than uk spot gas , without subsidy ) . 
   flamanville 3 and olkiluoto 3 provide great examples to not support more nuclear plants in the uk they provide great examples to not support building a small nuclear fleet with non-standardised designs . 
  if hmg is n't willing to put up a very large amount of money to build a whole fleet of npps , then they should n't have bothered . 
  nuclear is much more economic at scale . 
   so is this based on the installed ` capacity ' of these different types of power ? 
  or generated electricity ? 
  or what percentage of each was actually used by people ? 
  as far as i 'm aware this is based on nameplate capacity which is generally the maximum amount that a plant could produce ( exception hydro ) . 
  this capacity will usually vary based on on 1 ) ** maintenance/outage/refuelling ** , 2 ) ** fuel/water/wind / solar availability ** , or 3 ) ** electricity price ** . 
  nuclear is generally only out for no. 1 , and will often sell electricity at below cost or even negative prices . 
  intermittent renewables are generally out for reason no. 2 , and fossil fuels or bioenergy can be out for the third reason . 
  below is an example list of capacity factor ( % ) by technology in the uk over the last decade . 
  solar will be lower here [ because of the sun cover ] ( http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/renewable-energy-resources/europe/solar/europe_files/1-1-101.gif ) .

  we do n't know . 
  for the intermittent renewables it really depends on the local conditions , and if the local area they 're in is saturated with the same type ( e.g. 
  wind ) it could also depend on how much they are connected with other markets as the network could instruct generators to ` feather ' production . 
  for non-intermittent generation it will generally follow a supply stack like this http://www.timera-energy.com/content/uploads/2015/09/de-stack.bmp . 
  note that in other markets like the u.k. the position of coal/lignite and gas will be switched . 
  capacity factors for fossil fuel generation can be as low as 30-40 % ; this is okay for the new ccgt which can ramp up in half an hour or so without major strain , but coal power has more difficulties dispatching power flexibly .

  wow , it even has its own football stadium \u26bd !, 
  land prices, 
  armenia finally safe ( also , ports ! ), 
  estonia has an alright location also, 
  any excuse for a drink , 
  i have n't read about this case , but usually there 's an escalation in circumstances like this where an early reporting to child services by others in the community could have protected the child . 
  it is n't typically no violence -  beating the child to death . 
  it may cause security of supply issues to switch to electricity from gas for domestic heating . 
  there are other options for renewable heating , and gas heating is n't the lowest hanging fruit for decarbonisation .

  * the groin area is a breeding ground for germs . 
  especially as there is n't much air flow there * you likely touched taps , door handles , the flush button etc which have been contaminated by others * diseases like salmonella and influenza are spread by people not washing their hands enough , washing every time you pee is a good safeguard * in a lot of countries it 's seen as dirty to not wash your hands , so you can avoid people talking behind your back if someone catches you . 
  if it were n't for the 1d account and harry styles , bbc breaking news would be the top one for the uk according to twittercounter.com emma watson , coldplay , the economist and bbc world are all in the top 100 worldwide too we get a lot more representation in the 100-200 with people like rooney , stephen fry , simon cowell , and russel brand . 
  all very dominated by the yanks though . 
  presumably they 're being shipped over because they 're the best value for what importers need . 
  if it 's replaced by another supplier elsewhere which was second choice before , then costs may be passed on . 
  yes , and i think they 're much better at making blended whisky ( personal pleb opinion do n't judge me if i 'm ` wrong ' !, 
  all part of the plan http://uk.businessinsider.com/bbc-to-shut-down-recipes-website-2016-5, 
  i prefer sweeter drinks like p\u00e1linka , in fact one of my favourite spirits is a sweet alsatian brandy . 
  however , they 're different tastes , whisky is one of scotland 's top exports , and the eu is the top market for importing whisky . 
  here 's some figures about whisky 's relationship with the eu :  the french consume 183million bottles a year and ** more scotch whisky is sold in one month in france than cognac sells in a whole year ** . 
   exports to france are worth nearly # 500million a year . 
    spain is the second biggest export market , consuming just under 60million bottles and germany is not far behind with imports of 50million . 
    even poland and latvia purchase just under 20million bottles each . 
    and the netherlands purchases around 20million bottles . 
  latvia , poland and the netherlands all consume more than japan . 
    [ from the same article ] ( http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown-whisky-shows-rely-7949892 ) , the uk as a whole drinks only around 100million bottles a year . 
  i 'm not sure how popular the drink is in hungary though . 
  it switches to a bonus against fighting those of a different religion in the gods & kings expansion . 
  if it 's windy the next question would be how close it is to areas which need electricity . 
  you would also have to ask how good the local grid would be at allowing access and balancing intermittent generation .
