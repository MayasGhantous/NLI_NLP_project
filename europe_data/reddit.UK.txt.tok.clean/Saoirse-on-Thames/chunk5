  might be wind patterns ? 
  this map is slightly misleading as it does n't show the size proportional to capacity [ such as this ] ( https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-the-uk-generates-its-electricity ) . 
  other discussions in / r/energy ( where i saw it first ) and / r/mapporn https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/duplicates/5o2tuk/map_of_european_wind_farms/, 
  that soft power !, 
  this requires some eu development funding . 
  let 's set up a non-profit . 
  my crazy idea - throw blood/red paint [ on a komodo dragon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/slapvi4.jpg ) ( maybe [ some red wings also ] ( https://www.etsy.com/listing/170414298/red-dragon-wings-and-tail-set-red ) ) , have them [ roam around some grassy knoll in the brecon beacons ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sfpssfk.jpg ) with a traditional overcast sky in the background , and take a picture . 
  simple . 
  [ check out this rare photograph from shortly before the acts of union ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ggttmrp.jpg ) , when the red arrows went back in time to the 1700s so we could have the best flag . 
  edit : i actually really like that photo , so i 've posted it to / r/uk if you check out my submission history, 
  or he did n't meet her a lot , or he did n't feel the need for psychological tactics because whilst she does have a lot of influence , she 's not actually the prime minister . 
  how many times has he met with her ? 
  am also interested . 
  found these though : https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/uk/655377/most-popular-names-last-500-years-revealed-mary-john-smith-baby-names-children/amp?client=safari http://www.galbithink.org/names.htm, 
  plenty of comments are still up saying that it was muslims doing this , i 'm guessing the [ deleted ] comments were going one hell of a lot further than dogwhistles . 
  not sure why they included georgia but not armenia and azerbaijan , as they could 've shown savory and curly dock also . 
  i have n't been to sweden in over 10 years , but i ca n't remember not being able to order pizza without dill whilst i was there https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/21-disturbing-examples-of-russias-dill-addiction?utm_term=.canda8gak#.bhay3blnm, 
  apparently * britain * is the home of dill . 
  do you also put carrots in shoes or was my uncle having a laugh ? 
  and she is also wearing a beautiful dress, 
  this should be its own post, 
   what makes you say that ? 
  are you intimately familiar with this particular university ? 
  yes , i know some of the people the articles on this are quoting also ( e.g. 
  gevorg and v. milov ) . 
  eusp is definitely not a graduate mill , and it 's accredited in the eu ( by helsinki uni iirc ) and gwu in the u.s. 
  i also met some people who were dropped from the programme because they were n't putting enough work in . 
  the graduates have gone on to do interesting jobs at platts , gasunie , the dutch government , etc. 
  there are also numerous students who attended the university on a bp scholarship . 
  obviously with international students in russia the careers will be more energy focused . 
  eusp is often ranked as one of the top russian universities . 
  you 're absolutely right to be skeptical , but in this case the university has a solid base . 
  i did n't even go into the professors and visiting lecturers which are the most impressive parts of this school to be honest . 
  some of the students were recently involved in an lgbt film festival , but this is n't cited as an official reason . 
  possible though . 
  i do n't think the food is the alleged issue here , especially as the canteen at this university is basically two women with some microwaves and a fridge . 
  however , for the other ones , why not just suspend the cafeteria ? 
  i tried to make the title as neutral as possible but i 'm giving my own view in the comments . 
  the reasons behind suspending the university are ridiculous , and it 's clear that there is an ulterior motivation behind this , just as there was the last time they tried to close this university . 
  academics on twitter are calling it an attack on freedom of academic speech . 
  according to the university itself , the inspection and closure had been been sparked by a complaint from vitaly milonov , author of the `` gay propaganda '' law and currently a deputy in the state duma . 
  * alternative source : https://themoscowtimes.com/news/european-university-in-st-petersburg-closed-by-russian-education-watchdog-56499  artemy magun , the dean of the university 's political science and sociology faculty , said that the ruling `` seemed political . '', 
    `` our university was just denied the right to teach students by the government education agency on a technicality , '' he wrote in english on facebook . 
  `` the reason for an unprecedented series of control raids against the university seems to be political , even though we do not yet understand what exactly is the political actor behind the attacks and what it wants , '' he said . 
    `` i guess generally speaking there are people in this state who are afraid of any , even modest , touch of enlightenment and internationalism . 
  there is a chance that the situation is promptly resolved ( and some positive signs from above ) , but meanwhile we ca n't teach , '' he wrote . 
   edit : the band leningrad are showing their support , for better or worse : https://eu.spb.ru/forthcoming-events/17144-pokh-nakh-bog-teologicheskaya-mashina-ravnovesiya, 
  thanks !, 
  source ? 
  i was n't complaining , i do n't mind the rules i 'd just forgotten about it . 
  thank you anyway . 
  yes , i had more info as a top-level comment but it included a link to the daily mail so was removed by the mods . 
  i feel uncomfortable linking the dm but it has more info http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3966566/experts-deliver-mini-budget-verdict-amid-tory-infighting-brexit-costs.html the original source is the press association, 
  for some reason i was thinking about a chp plant . 
  you 're right about this . 
  does n't work well with european food , but with asian food it 's easier than a knife and fork ( especially for street food !, 
  burning gasoline is probably more expensive than waste wood , and is releasing carbon into the atmosphere that was sequestered millions of years ago - which can cause serious climate change if done on a large enough scale . 
  burning wood releases carbon temporarily sequestered within the last ~ 20-30 years and is carbon neutral over its lifecycle . 
  also , japan as an island without its own oil and gas reserves does n't really have a secure energy supply if it relies on gasoline . 
  no , they 're called reusable chopsticks and you can easily buy a pair for under # 2, 
  extra pain for big cities like st. petersburg . 
  also i 'm pretty sure the natives had names for places before the colonists came . 
  it 's a bottleneck and a pain if you 're driving through , or on a bus . 
  could be easier on trains though , so maybe this will be the incentive for belfast and dublin to have a decent cheap rail service between them . 
  i did n't realise that , that 's a cool fact to know !, 
  getting the government to close down a newspaper is n't how things should be done in liberal democracies . 
  boycotting though ? 
  that 's a perfectly valid form of free speech . 
  same with peaceful protesting etc, 
  it was n't necessarily the games that saved them from the brink . 
  up until 2004 the company was still family run , and it was an ex-mckinsey consultant that took over and made some tough calls . 
  redundancies were made , the number of parts that could be used were halved , and the games department was also shut down ( it was very unprofitable at the time and the games were later licensed out to companies that actually knew how to make money from games ) . 
  to drive home just how dire the management was , some of their toys were actually loss-leaders - except nobody knew !, 
  so they were making some toys at a loss and not realising it . 
  and a few landed probes on venus ( starting in the 60s ! ), 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.gov.scot/topics/statistics/browse/economy/exports/esspublication ) oil and gas is third down on the list of top exports . 
  if you 're looking at a single product , whisky is probably the most important . 
  it sounded a bit like moon river , which is in the public conscious but not easy to place . 
  ` public engagements ' is code for turning up to parties/events and occasionally waving . 
  if you look at the number of gaffes over the years it would be a surprise in any normal job that he was n't fired . 
  i think you 're right here . 
  i trust the uk government will soon confirm that they will end his # 359,000 annual parliamentary annuity https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sovereign-grant-act-2011-guidance/sovereign-grant-act-2011-guidance, 
  when that subreddit was founded it would 've been almost exclusively american . 
  once a subreddit has been built and becomes the default it 's hard to topple that . 
  norfolk enchants, 
  on an american website ... 
  it 's up now , there was a problem with the website the data was going into, 
  yep . 
  especially when there 's been a system failure you can get some real anomalies . 
  the value of lost load is several times higher than the usual cost of energy, 
  it 's up now . 
  green colour , carbon intensity 201g , fossil fuels at 21 % , net exports, 
  the website i posted shows live c02 emissions , not historical . 
  not absurd !, 
  some numbers can be super high at different times of the day for whatever reason . 
  if a big power plant had suddenly shut down without notice the price could easily spike . 
  no nuclear power plant has ever been built in a free market without massive state support . 
  private investors can help , but at the end of the day it 's politics that will decide . 
   so yeah , one hell of a problem for future generations to solve or us today even . 
  here 's the yearly budget of the old department of energy and climate change for the uk http://www.carbonbrief.org/media/403207/deccpie1.png,
