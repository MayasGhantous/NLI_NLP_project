  the numbers do n't correlate properly . 
  poland 's prices are listed in zloty , uk in gbp , etc. 
  you have to take into account the exchange rate it 's a live map so if you want referential electricity prices it 's better to check a report like this https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/quarterly_report_on_european_electricity_markets_q4_2016.pdf, 
  a lot of the cost for nuclear power plants ( and carbon impact ) is in construction , and there could be some saving building on a preexisting site like in lithuania . 
  it is usually shown , for some reason it is not there today . 
  you 'll see in the thumbnail preview that it 's a dark orange . 
   nuclear waste is not problem or not that big of a problem , it is blown out of proportion yes , but the main issue policymakers have with it is the cost . 
   it is by far the best option to produce electricity now this is really dependent on how much money you 're willing to spend , how much pollution you can tolerate , how dispatchable you want your generation to be etc. 
  there 's no single ` best ' option for everyone . 
   i would like to see stricter policies on other plants , because burning coal hurt everybody , but nuclear power plant can only potentially damage health , agreed , i 'd actually like a review of nuclear regulation to see if there are any cost savings to be made . 
  coal should be entirely phased out in europe , and it is already happening in scotland , ruk , france , belgium etc. 
  people have been telling me ( irl ) that le pen is better for the uk because she 'll be sympathetic to us leaving the eu . 
  this is based on them thinking that france controls the european commission , because it is based in strasbourg . 
  spontaneous generation is usually the one i use as it 's a logical thought process yet sounds completely absurd to us today : * https://www.wired.com/2014/06/fantastically-wrong-how-to-grow-a-mouse-out-of-wheat-and-sweaty-shirts/ * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spontaneous_generation i like the metal ships idea too . 
  a picture of elizabeth was in every classroom of my primary school , and in our morning assembly we were all told how much she loved us . 
  charles will be seen as a fatherly figure likewise . 
  would a decade old picture of a criminal youth be at over 5000 points for little reason except to tar all the ethnic russians with the same feather ? 
  glad we agree on the gypsy thing though . 
  we do n't know all the laws that have been subject to a royal veto , and as such we ca n't say for sure why they were vetoed or given an opportunity to do so . 
  on advice of ministers is pretty vague anyway . 
  civil servants are supposed to formally consult the monarch , and if the response is that the law would n't be in the interest of the monarch , a minister may then well advise that the monarch simply vetoes the legislation - even if they were fully prepared to commit to that piece of legislation otherwise . 
  nowhere in the original government guidance does it say that , what you 're saying is speculative . 
  regardless , there are two options : * what you 're saying is right , and ministers have a way to bypass popular bills from appearing in parliament . 
  the institution of the monarchy and the crown ( * not the royals themselves * ) just hand over vast almost unlimited powers to our politicians . 
  in which case this is a politicians ' monarchy - it makes our government far too powerful and allows them to ignore the wishes of the people . 
  * the monarch and the prince are using their influence to block government action against their interests - even going so far as to include our defence policy . 
  i called the uk a democracy in my last sentence  there are countless positions within government that are unelected the important distinction here is that they are held to account either by the electorate ( through an election ) or by someone chosen to represent the people . 
   the uk and many other european countries , despite your claim , have perfectly healthy democracies despite the existence of a monarchy we are lucky to live in mature and yes , healthy , democracies . 
  at the same time , if there 's room for improvement , it 's perfectly valid for me to be in favour of that , 
  good time to start a blog ? 
  also / r/britishrepublicans and / r/republicanism, 
  say what you want about british politics , but they 've been becoming much more interesting to watch over the last few years .

  most of us claim to believe in democracy , we value our freedoms and believe we have the right to hold people to account . 
  if we really believe in democratic values then there 's no place for the monarchy . 
  if you do n't agree with the above that 's fine , and completely your right in a democracy .

  born equal !, 
  selective enforcement is almost as bad, 
  the british monarch has actual powers that she uses though , which i imagine is different from the dutch system http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9801835/queen-and-prince-charles-using-power-of-veto-over-new-laws-whitehall-documents-reveal.html, 
  puts this in perspective how different groups have ` acceptable ' stereotyping . 
  this subreddit does not have a favourable view of russians and gypsies . 
  coal plants face pressure from lower load factors ( on less , because variable/startup costs in other plants are cheaper ) , the uk 's higher carbon price , and recently cheaper gas generation . 
  these are market fundamentals which are n't going to change * drastically * because of brexit .

  i was thought it was the daily mash/newsthump talking about her, 
  corbyn hinted that they 'd back it http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-general-election-theresa-may-prime-minister-progressive-alliance-liberal-democrats-a7489891.html and they 've been preparing for it http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/01/labour-puts-aside-4-million-war-chest-fight-snap-election-amid/, 
  i believe she needs a 2/3 majority in the hoc , have n't checked this though - all come as a bit of a surprise, 
   theresa may said she would ask parliament to hold a general election so she can win a direct mandate to take the country through the brexit divorce with the eu . 
    the decision , which comes just three weeks after the prime minister began the formal brexit process , stunned many british politicians as they returned from their easter break . 
    mrs may said she had `` only recently and reluctantly '' concluded that an election was desirable . 
  `` the decision facing the country will be all about leadership , '' she said , from a lectern on downing street . 
    mrs may had previously said categorically that the next general election would be held as scheduled in 2020 , and many conservative backbenchers had shown little enthusiasm for a vote . 
  `` it is n't going to happen . 
  there is not going to be a general election , '' her spokesman said on march 20 . 
    the prime minister is understood to have changed her mind after taking advice from senior figures including sir lynton crosby , mastermind of the 2015 election campaign . 
  two polls over the easter weekend put the conservatives 21 points ahead of labour , a lead that is likely to greatly increase its existing working commons majority of 17 . 
    holding an election gives mrs may an opportunity to win a direct mandate for the first time to be prime minister . 
  she took power last july without a public vote , after david cameron resigned and her remaining rival in the conservative leadership contest , andrea leadsom , pulled out of the race . 
  if mrs may had remained in power without a vote until 2020 , it would have been the longest a prime minister had served without an election since winston churchill during the second world war . 
    the tories ' existing majority would have made it harder for the government to push through its repeal bill , which transfers eu legislation into the statute book , without significant amendments . 
  william hague , the former conservative leader , was among those to have called for an early poll in an attempt to win a larger majority . 
    a general election will allow mrs may may to ditch the 2015 tory manifesto , and campaign on her own policies -- including the opening of new grammar schools , which have been opposed by tory moderates . 
  key policies from the cameron era , including a commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national product on international development , might also be changed . 
    but the vote holds electoral risks for the conservative party . 
  the lib dems , which had a disastrous 2015 election , could rebound in the south-west and in remain-supporting areas . 
  mrs may would hope that any losses would be more than offset by big tory gains against a crippled labour party in the midlands and north . 
    the scottish national party , which has called for a second independence referendum by mid-2019 , could use the election to win a new mandate for such a vote . 
  an election comes as northern ireland remains in political turmoil , following the failure of the main unionists and nationalist parties to come to a power-sharing deal . 
    some tory mps also argue that a general election would `` wipe the slate clean '' in the row about election expenses ; police have investigated allegations of electoral fraud in at least a dozen seats at the 2015 election , raising the prospect of possible by-elections . 
    but others have fought against the decision because labour is currently on the ropes with no obvious end to the corbyn regime . 
  a labour election defeat in 2017 might bring forward the replacement of mr corbyn with a more electable alternative , they argue . 
    under the 2011 fixed term parliaments act , the government can trigger an election in two ways : either by losing a vote of no-confidence by a simple majority , or by passing an election motion with the backing of two-thirds of mps . 
    the latter course is possible , because the labour leadership , the scottish national party and the liberal democrats have all pledged to back an early election . 
  mrs may could also seek to repeal the fixed-term parliaments act , requiring votes in the commons and the lords . 
    the election will be held on existing parliamentary boundaries , not under the proposed reforms that would further weaken the labour party . 
    much of the uk is already due to go to the polls on may 4 to elect local councillors and new metropolitan mayors . 
  i 'm fine with the anti histamines i mentioned above , and they were no more than a few rubles per pill !, 
  yes , this was my favourite brand as it was as effective as they get but also smelt pleasant to myself and others http://www.gardex.ru/aerozol-ot-kleshchey-i-komarov-dlya-detey-100-ml repellents can never be 100 % effective though , especially if a mossie gets in your apartment it 's only a matter of time . 
  one bite ( on my neck next to a gland ) even gave me a fever for three days , and this would keep happening until i started taking the medicine every day . 
  yes that is strange for the last bit . 
  most russians i meet tend to have a healthy mistrust of their state tv/news outlets . 
  to be fair , most crimeans are pro-russian . 
  yes i was pretty thankful for the winter for that reason . 
  i found out i was allergic to the mosquitoes there a few years ago and it was hell until i found a pharmacist that sold ' \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d ' . 
  also means a huge amount of mosquitoes and damp, 
  or rapidly ramped up climate change , thanks to all the methane that presumably got released by destroying the landmass . 
  also , about half of russia is covered in forests ( something like 20 % of the world total ) , [ which sequester considerably more carbon annually than russia emits ] ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/russia-s-forests-overlooked-in-climate-change-fight1/ ) . 
  my comment was written in reply to / u/spirit _ inc , and my comment intended to show that no great power is innocent of atrocities . 
  i agree with your general point , and i hope you understood what i wrote in context . 
  should germans dislike being german because of what their parents may have been complicit in ? 
  certain things we might consider war crimes today http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/reading/war.crimes/us/u.s.philippines.htm,

  hell , what the americans did in iraq , nicaragua , guantanomo or the philippines is n't all sunshine either . 
   the love between estonia and finland is so strong , the russian border connecting them still remains .
