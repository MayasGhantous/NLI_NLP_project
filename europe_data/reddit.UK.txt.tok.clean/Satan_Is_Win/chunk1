i love you corbyn thanks for the tory victory in 2020, 
  what is racist about this thread, 
  control your border with italy then ? 
  you could stop them entering france ? 
  we have an agreement that you look after your side of the border and we look after our side . 
  you ca n't void that agreement just because you ca n't be arsed to deal with the migrants anymore . 
  i do n't mind the results at all . 
  fptp ensures a strong government that can be held accountable easily . 
  if you have coalition after coalition then if they do n't keep one of their promises they can quite easily claim that they needed to compromise on it due to the agreement they had . 
  with fptp if you make a set of promises which you run your campaign on and win a majority you can easily be held accountable . 
  ukip got screwed and that does n't seem fair but this system has worked for hundreds of years and it has worked well . 
  once the conservatives shift to the right again , which is where they are meant to be , then ukip will disappear . 
  ukips election strategy was also run by a load of amateurs so they really should have won more than one seat . 
  are you joking ? 
  if wanting what is best for our country is arrogant then yes we are arrogant . 
  other people would call that logical which is something you germans are meant to be good at . 
  for you the eu is good but for us that 's not the case . 
  if it was bloody good for us then we would n't be having a hotly contested referendum . 
  we wanted a free trade area not a political union that is taking more and more of our sovereignty away from us . 
  cameron wants to stay in the eu . 
  yes they just train and they need parental consent to even apply before 18 . 
  i do n't think allowing 16 year olds to fight in helmand is moral or very good for pr ... 
  yeah but they ca n't be deployed in combat zones until they are 18 . 
  perhaps you could pay off your debts instead of adding rifles to your arsenal ? 
  i just do n't think its the right time for wealthy countries to share their resources when we have just come out of a recession and are attempting to balance the books . 
  it just seems nonsensical to me ; if you want to share resources i.e. 
  good schooling then do it at a time when you can build new schools and increase the education budget . 
  350,000 immigrants a year = less school places or larger class sizes = decrease in educational standards . 
  this is n't exactly a surprise . 
   stop fearmongering about the immigrants there is a lot to be fearful of . 
   why would they need to send people here when many of them were actually from europe in the first place ? 
  why would they not send sleeper agents here ? 
  think about what a golden opportunity this is for them to send people who are ** already radicalized and trained ** from their territories in libya across to italy . 
  it 's a lot easier to pay for one man to get on a boat instead of slowly radicalizing someone over months and months , hooking them up with a controller , mentoring and training them , getting them all the supplies needed for their attack and then encouraging them to actually carry out the attack . 
  anyone in europe is going to have their internet monitored if they keep searching up suspicion things so that 's another pitfall of international radicalization . 
  why bother when you have an easy route to send trained agents over who you are almost certain will carry out the attack with pleasure and are not on any government watch list because they have no identity/documents ? 
  even if it happens to be more effective to use domestically radicalized european agents , which it is n't , why would they not try and do both ? 
  they have a huge cashflow through selling oil , raiding banks , taxes and selling artifacts so they can certainly afford it . 
   highly visible africans these africans are not exactly highly visible if only 10 % of them carry documents . 
  once they are in italy they have free reign to go wherever they want to . 
  the italian government do n't care as long as they leave the country . 
   if they were able to attack they would have done it immediately these things do take time you know . 
  how long did it take al-qaeda to plan and prepare for 9/11 ? 
  you do n't carry out a terrorist attack on a whim . 
  it requires months , sometimes even year , of planning and preparation . 
  charlie hebdo was n't planned in a day it took time and was planned by aqap . 
   propoganda it 's not propoganda if documents planning this stuff were found in raids is it ? 
  similarly , if they wanted to scare the weak europeans , then why did they put the declaration out in arabic and only circulate it through specific circles before it got ** leaked ** onto twitter . 
  this is not a scare tactic . 
  why the hell would they not take this golden opportunity to hurt the kafirs ? 
  to not do so would be foolish , and is are anything but that .

  well it 's pretty likely that they are legitimate . 
  is released a declaration two months ago stating that they would implant sleeper agents , or whatever you want to call them , in the boats full of migrants . 
  hardly surprising . 
  why do syriza have to be such a pain in the ass to everyone, 
  that 's not the reason at all . 
  watch this and enlighten yourself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vukjtppcodq, 
  i 'd love to see farage being racist once . 
  got an example ? 
  if you do n't like him fine that 's fine but do n't try and stifle debate on key issues like immigration by misusing words like racism and xenophobia . 
  all you do is create an echo chamber where everyone perpetuates each others views . 
  unless that 's what you want ? 
  i would like to see an example of a ukip policy that is racist or a comment from farage . 
  how is he doing a `` disservice '' to his party and people ? 
  he was in a high speed car crash when he was young that he almost lost his leg in and was hospitalised for months . 
  he was in casts for a year . 
  two years ago a biplane he was flying in crashed injuring him even more http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01630/coming-out-of-wrec_1630933i.jpg he has been going to hospital 3 times a week throughout the entire election . 
  he would n't be able to handle any longer without a break . 
  if anything he is doing the people that believe in him and his party a service by campaigning at all because he knows that he is their biggest asset . 
  whatever you think of the man , that is steadfast dedication . 
  he 's been in hospital 3 times a week for the entire campaign because of all of the problems regarding his body from his high speed car crash and then recent plane crash . 
  he ca n't take it so he is having a well deserved holiday . 
  how is that being a knob ? 
  to say we are n't a regional superpower is ridiculous . 
  5th largest economy in the world , second largest in europe . 
  2nd best in terms of power projection ( google studies on this too - we are one of the only countries with a blue water navy ) 3 . 
  3rd best in terms of soft power ( you can google studies on this ) 4 . 
  best military in europe ( we are comparable with france but have more experience ) 5 . 
  hugely professional and respected foreign office . 
  our diplomats are the envy of the world . 
  hugely influential culture second only to the us - tv , literature , films ( look at how many british actors were nominated for oscars last time ) , music , plays , sport ( we dominated the olympics remember . 
  good at cricket , rugby and have one of the best football leagues in the world ) 7 . 
  while it is true to say that primary and secondary education in general lets us down , we have brilliant universities and public schools . 
  the best secondary schools in india , china , south east asia , pakistan all base themselves or are linked to national treasures like eton , harrow and charterhouse . 
  our universities fill the ranks of the top 100 in the world - oxford , lse , cambridge , ucl , manchester , kings , durham and imperial to name a few . 
  we are second to the us in terms of higher education . 
  anyone who knows anything about ir knows the power of the uk . 
  it is true to say that we have fallen in grace but do n't underestimate our influence . 
  will get back to you tommorrow not at my pc until tomorrow afternoon, 
  because it 's my opinion . 
  i 'm not claiming that what i said was objectively right , i 'm just rejecting the other guy who said that my statement was objectively wrong . 
  i 'm more worried for her constituents . 
  got a source for that ? 
  i do n't care about downvotes i care about people censoring opinions because they are contrary to their own, 
  what a brilliant idea - ruin your diplomatic relations through spite with a regional economic , military and cultural superpower ... 
  the youngest tory mp is 31 . 
  unless he lives with his mum i 'm fairly sure he has lived alone at one point . 
  i 'm finding my sources now will post later - if i do n't post in the next few hours reply to this post, 
  i 'm not denying that there are way of quantifying it but that is still ultimately subjective .
