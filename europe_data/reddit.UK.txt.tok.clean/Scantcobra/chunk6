  it would n't have been great but it would be fine until a long term solution is made . 
  are there any plans to increase the fertility rate ? 
  it was the fuse that lit it . 
  a europe as on edge as now could easily have big side effects . 
   isis is just terrorism terrorism is responsible for one of the world wars . 
  it 's not overblown and is a major threat everyone . 
  except trying to buy illegal guns is incredibly difficult if you do n't have a source already and those guns you do get are usually shit . 
  look at the guns that the lee rigby killers had , it exploded in their hands . 
  the reason america has so many shooter is because are already in massive circulation in the u.s so stopping them now would be useless . 
  however , there are still very few in europe that arming the police all over the continent would be a waste of resources and probably cause more harm from police abuses than lives saved . 
  this argument has happened a thousand times . 
  the british people do n't want the police to be armed and the police themselves do n't want guns . 
  i 'm sure the 14 people gunned down in san bernardino where shocked that armed cops did n't equal an impregnable shield . 
  but what are you going to do ? 
  i 'm just thankful that the attacker did n't have easier access to guns . 
  no one 's sure yet . 
  one man has been injured but his condition is unknown . 
  i 've heard that the longer you live in the city , the more of your soul is devoured by the sentient metropolis itself and you become just a drone , an organ . 
  operating , but not self aware . 
  awakening only to redeem ones oyster card . 
  en route to the scene ? 
  thankfully , officers on site where able to solve the issue before it got even further out of hand . 
  it 's comments like this which makes me keep coming back here . 
  pretty useful information as now we 're certain this will either end in a peaceful revolution remembered for the ages or nuclear war . 
  francis fukuyama states the common law is one of three integral parts for a successful nation-state , alongside a strong centralised state and political accountability . 
  it 's what arguably pushed england , and then the u.k , into a civilization which has had one of , if not the most , affect on human history , despite being a small , wet island . 
  micheal gove has been fired so he no longer holds any sway over the conservative party . 
  i wish i was a sexy 100 year old who just went around getting ass and playing a children 's card game all day . 
  not surprised , pretty much every gym besides two so far have been churches . 
  they still make up a lot of pok\u00e9stops alongside pubs as well . 
  i do n't see how this photo of an empty airstrip really helps us too much though , tbh . 
  cromwell is n't hailed as hero here ? 
  he 's described as in insane religious extremist who banned christmas and killed many who disagreed with him . 
  to be fair , as globalisation takes a stronger hold on the world , the death and merging of languages is an inevitable thing . 
  i would be surprised if we could recognise a lot of the english language in 100 years . 
  i would also be surprised if more than 5 main languages where in use throughout the world for things other than studying and preservation . 
  the debate about the start of the industrial revolution also concerns the massive lead that great britain had over other countries . 
  some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the british slave trade between africa and the caribbean helped fuel industrial investment . 
  however , it has been pointed out that slave trade and west indian plantations provided only 5 % of the british national income during the years of the industrial revolution . 
  even though slavery accounted for so little , caribbean-based demand accounted for 12 % of britain 's industrial output . 
  so it was important but i would n't say it was the deciding factor that plunged the uk into the industrial revolution is a bit of an exaggeration . 
  the industrial revolution then just gave europe the lead it need to go from success after success really both for the benefit of many and detriment of others . 
  the rise of the west came long before the large scale colonialism , and roughly around the time of the resiancse as european nations put much more money into technological advancements in order to be get ahead of other european counterparts . 
  european rise to wealth and dominance can be seen much before colonisation in africa & asia even before total domination of the america 's , it can be seen in china 's foreign policies in the lead up to the 17th century , which was a series of events that lead them to be much more inclusive and build the great wall . 
  look up vasco de gama to look how european technology brought europe ahead or read up on military advancements and economical advancements made in the 16th and 17th centuries . 
  that being said , colonisation had definitely kept europe at it 's high level development relative to other nations throughout history . 
  but to claim that colonisation back then is keeping europe at the top now despite european colonisation being over for over half a century is absurd . 
  europe is competitive , hosts some of the best employee rights laws , high gdp per capita which allow for europe to remain at the of hdi .

  7 * out of 10 in europe . 
  encompassing around 121.117 million people . 
  truly amazing . 
  edit 1 : i originally put 9 , but changed because i was looking at the wrong list . 
  edit 2 : literally all of the replies to my comment are cancerous . 
  a while ago i might have have agreed with you , but the self-flagellation that goes on in r/unitedkingdom has pushed many over to / r/ukpolitics and made it a pretty balanced place relative to former and / r/scotland . 
  before the referendum / r/ukpolitics was quite leaning over to pro-leave , now it is much more remain , with healthy discussions on the benefits and negatives of both . 
  sorry , you were right , i did mean pro-eu . 
  i just was n't reading through my comment correctly . 
  you were correct , i meant , pro-eu . 
  i do n't really miss him due to him being in thatcher 's government . 
  but he would have been pretty useful in the upcoming brexit process . 
  annoyed he has been let go . 
  it is highlighted here :  the others fear getting purged from government if they speak up about it . 
  is the first sentence you said . 
   that brexit is stupid ** or that there are good things about the eu ** . 
  is the justifications you gave for some being purged . 
  `` brexit is stupid '' : anti-brexit . 
  helstine nor anyone else has been purged because they were anti-brexit . 
  he caused internal strife in the party . 
  `` or that there are good things about the eu '' : pro-eu . 
  helstine nor anyone else has been purged for being pro-eu . 
  your original comment is not true . 
  that being said helstine was a decent well experienced adviser member and i am sad to see him gone . 
   the others fear getting purged from government if they speak up about it . 
   that brexit is stupid ** or that there are good things about the eu ** . 
  based off your first comment , you said people were being purged . 
  this comment imply 's they are being purged for being pro-eu or anti-brexit . 
  people are being purged for neither . 
  he was critical of theresa may , his boss , for her handling of brexit . 
  not brexit itself . 
  helstine served on margaret thatcher 's cabinet and likely voted to leave himself . 
  there are entire parties that are anti-brexit and hesltine was n't against brexit , he was annoyed at how it was handled . 
  stop exaggerating . 
  nobody is being purged for being pro-eu . 
  speak up about what ? 
  the chances of turkey joining are much more slimmer than iceland and norway becoming members . 
  norway and iceland meet almost all of the requirements to join it 's simply a matter of whether or not their citizens want to join . 
  turkey , however , is moving in the opposite direction and its people do really seem to have an appetite for joining the e.u. 
  the benefits and concessions we have now will be up for debate when we rejoin depending on how well the u.k is doing in the world at the time of joining . 
  it 's too soon to tell . 
  does n't have to be exactly alike , just close enough for the conditions in many eastern european countries to be attractive for u.k citizens to move over to . 
  right now , few british people would want to move to romania in the same way we have seen romanian 's come to the u.k. 
  we 're leaning to the right now , it 's more than likely within 2 decades we 'll be leaning to the left like we have the past two decades .
