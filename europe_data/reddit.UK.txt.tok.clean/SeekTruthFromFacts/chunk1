it 's been [ done ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fqgz5/nobel_laureates_per_capita_in_european_countries/ctr2zaf ) earlier on this thread . 
  it from latin . 
  properly pan-european !, 
  warm winds ?!?!?!? 
  you mean the [ warm sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_stream ), 
  yes , it was specifically forbidden in the treaties . 
  sadly , i think you 're hugely optimistic about how much most americans and brits pay attention to the news . 
  and neither country has historical connections to the caucasus . 
  `` what do you get when you have combination of these two ( ethnic nationalism and being trained in fighting ) ? 
  huge amounts of interethnic violene and ethnic gangs per capita . '', 
  thank you explaining how president putin 's personality affects his political policies . 
  i think religion is perhaps more relevant than ethnicity in this particular case . 
  the current chechen leader is a russian vassal . 
  he 's still a gangster ( his defence minister recently laid siege to the house of a teenage girl until she agreed to become his latest ` wife ' ) but he 's putin 's gangster and so fights in putin 's wars . 
  if there 'd been a ;-) i might have caught your tone of voice , but redditors do n't seem to use emoticons much , so i do n't blame you . 
  you 're making me feel old ... 
  but i think a lot more lithuanians would speak russian than would speak french or german , right ? 
  because everyone from estonia to bulgaria was forced to learn russian in high school until 1991 . 
  that 's a large chunk of the eu 's population . 
  it was not a country and esperanto was not its official language . 
   there used to be a tiny ~ ~ european country ~ ~ border zone that had an esperanto enthusiast ~ ~ as its national language ~ ~ . 
  ftfy . 
  promoting esperanto is a perfectly respectable endeavour , but try to seek truth from the facts . 
  no , this is the european parliament . 
  mr muscat was previously an mep . 
  and i 'd imagine each government provides its own interpreters for council meetings . 
  i 'm not supporting the latin-as-eu-working-language idea , but latin was the working language of educated people in ireland for centuries because it was the main language of church business and scholarship . 
  if he 's written a speech in maltese on a complex point of policy , he might not want to * ad lib * and misstate . 
  it 's his absolute right to use his official language in his parliament . 
  if you ca n't speak it there , it 's a major setback for the whole future of the language . 
  there 's some sense in this , but then russian should probably be an eu working language and * that * would be controversial . 
  source ? 
  i 've never heard that and i 've read a lot of european history . 
  i think that would be part of it . 
  plus the whole issue of cultural mcdonaldization . 
  the uk has invaded every european country except belarus and possibly andorra , i think . 
  the eu already has three working languages . 
  but mr muscat ( the mep in the op ) was right : if each nation ca n't use their own language in an ep plenary , when can they ? 
  not an official language of the * eu * . 
  firstly , there is no eu constitution - dutch and french voters rejected it . 
  secondly , article 40 of the treaties ( teu ) says there can be a common foreign and security policy . 
  there 's no common policy on defence spending , not least because not all member states are in nato ( the ones i mentioned are all neutral ) . 
  the bbc has a similar programme , * more or less * , with a [ british edition ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qshd ) and a [ worldwide edition ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00msxfl ) .

  i do n't think ireland , sweden or austria want to increase greek defence spending . 
  the cynic in me thinks that in certain parts of germany cutting greek military spending so turkey can do what it wants ought to win * lots * of votes !, 
  if this was really an issue , would n't tsipras and varoufakis have made full use of it ? 
  it would be such an easy propaganda win for them . 
  no , it 's about internal greek politics . 
  very interesting comparison , thank you . 
  i did n't justify the occupation . 
  i said that two wrongs do n't make a right . 
   greece fucked up , turkey should have left . 
  i would n't use that wording , but i agree . 
   wtf did the uk do as a guarantor ?? 
  the uk did not cover itself in glory . 
  in mitigation i would plead that in early '74 we were literally [ struggling to keep the lights turned on at home ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three-day_week ) and then had a minority government , so there was little appetite to start a war with a major nato ally . 
  i do n't think the turks would have backed down before there was real fighting , and maybe not even then . 
  but not when you 're spending german taxpayers ' money to do it . 
  i think most nato members should increase their defence spending to hit the 2 % target , but not greece right now . 
  the best way they can strengthen nato is by building tougher banks , not tougher tanks . 
  and greece , a nato member , supported a coup d'\u00e9tat in violation of its treaty commitments . 
  both sides behaved like idiots . 
  nationalism helps no-one . 
  greece was one of the highest defence spenders in nato even after the financial crisis started . 
  indeed , sadly not ... 
  that would certainly be varoufakis style !, 
  seems to me that this is clear proof that whoever 's running greek utilities is failing badly and that major reforms are needed . 
  which is just what the eurogroup has asked for . 
  everyone signed up , very explicitly , to `` ever closer union '' . 
  not quite the same as use - we are a union of peoples , not a melting pot - but close enough . 
  of course we get it . 
  the euro was intended to lead towards ever closer union . 
  fiscal integration in due course was expected . 
  that 's just teasing ... 
  please share ... 
  this is an important point . 
  the franco-german relationship was a great engine for integration . 
  an engine does n't work well as a brake . 
  thank you , u/hampemannen, 
  undoubtedly it 's related to greco-turkish relations . 
  but i 'm not sure `` fear '' is necessarily the right emotion . 
  and the turkish armed forces have got other things on their minds right now . 
  if there was ever a moment for the greek military to stop obsessing about turkey , it 's now . 
  thank you for sharing your view . 
  greeks have huge sympathy from their friends across europe . 
  a quick question : would you support massive cutbacks in defence spending to protect pensions ? 
  background for other redditors : * in the early years of the financial crisis , [ greece had the highest rate of defence spending in the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org / wiki/list _ of_countries_by_military_expenditure_per_capita ) . 
  * there were [ some cutbacks ] ( http://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/4/19/1334857091656/greek-defence-spending-001.png?w=620&amp;q=85&amp;auto=format&amp;sharp=10&amp;s=50effecd1884ee9383344380dfdec95d ) more recently , but greece still spends about half as much as israel ( which is pretty much in a constant state of war ) and half as much as spain ( which has more than four times as many people ) [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_military_expenditure_%28constant_us$%29#2010%e2%80%932019 ) . 
  * the supposedly left-wing greek government announced this week that [ reductions in military spending are completely off the table ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/01/eurozone-greece-defense-idusa8n0zc00u20150701 ) if this was latvia or lithuania , living next door to an aggressor like putin , i could understand this . 
  but the only people invading greece are starving somalis and syrians . 
  greece ca n't afford guns or butter ; it should focus on buying bread . 
  yle swedish [ appears to be reporting it as fact ] ( http://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/07/11/finland-och-tyskland-sager-nej-till-grekland ) that finland and germany will say no to a bailout . 
  the headline seems more confident than the actual article though . 
  can a swedish speaker confirm/deny ? 
  the oldest mosque in britain ( 1896 ) is already listed and english heritage has recently finished a survey to find more : [ heritage grants and listed status beckon for uk mosques ] ( http://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/news/17208/ ) [ the mosque in britain ] ( http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/imported-docs/p-t/rn20-the-mosque-in-britain.pdf ) ( * sic * ), 
  greece is the one nato country that should be spending less on defence . 
  they have 500 military bases ( which is more than the us by one measure ) !, 
  and they employ huge numbers of conscripted soldiers to handle the paperwork for numerous exemptions for other conscripted soldiers . 
  there 's a difference between # 8 with tax credits and # 9 without tax credits .
