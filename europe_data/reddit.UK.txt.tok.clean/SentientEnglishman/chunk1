they force us not to sell straight bananas this one wo n't die will it ? 
  same . 
  i was ready to settle here for life but now we left the eu i am unsettled . 
  i no longer want to consider this place home and my wife and i are , in the long run , planning to leave . 
  i wanted to go turkey , now i 'll just not . 
  might go visit kuwait again , at least their government is n't completely incompetent . 
  in this case it 's definitely still true , more so than ever given how many loanwords the japanese take on these days . 
  it 's a true stereotype . 
  learn a little bit of japanese and you 'll realise just how many loanwords japan uses and how `` engrish '' they all sound . 
  i did n't see that implication in that post and did n't read his others . 
  good point , in which case it does look like his post is accurate . 
  culture and society are intrinsically linked , as is choice of government and national policies in a democracy . 
  if a country has more over spenders than another it is an aspect and problem of that country . 
  uk is also valid and more accurate . 
  they 're worthless scum that do n't deserve happiness or comfort in life because they have n't worked hard enough like me !, 
  ^ / s the nhs saved my life at a time when _ my mother _ had absolutely no money . 
  i 'm glad to have been born in the uk for that alone . 
  which is a shame because there are at-will employment states in the us _ and _ it 's [ estimated that ~ 30 million americans have no health insurance ] ( http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/05/10/even-obamacare-29-million-people-are-uninsured-here-s-why ) , the article expands on why ( a lot of ignorance about the topic ) but in national health systems you ca n't really be ignorant of how much easier and more likely to be free it is . 
  remember , 30 million is ~ 10 % of the us population . 
  10 % is a huge portion of a population to be without health care . 
  and remember , this is only having _ any _ health insurance , not full coverage . 
   nobody making 150k a year should be living paycheck by paycheck . 
  that 's true but saying that does n't make it not occur . 
  he 's spreading misinformation/lies , none of what he said is true as per [ this link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_between_u.s._states_and_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29 ) . 
  i 've read that lie/myth a hundred times since around 2004 . 
  i have no idea why you 're spreading misinformation when the uk 's ppp is on par with california 's , as shown by [ this page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_between_u.s._states_and_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29 ) . 
  he misread the person 's post and made a nonsense response . 
  there 's no anti-us circlejerk here , just people discussing the differences between countries . 
  the only time the term `` circlejerk '' comes out is when people disagree with a larger group . 
  it should be of no bloody shock to you that / r/europe prefers _ europe _ as a place to live . 
  he said if you _ want _ a lot of salary the us is good , not that you 'd only move there for salary . 
  http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/gb/us i 'm just annoyed that they used gb for the uk instead of uk . 
  for the average that could be true , but for those living nearer the bottom of us society that extra 67 % is going to be largely constant . 
  the need for healthcare does n't scale with income , if anything it tends to be that those with less money need _ more _ healthcare . 
  a simple % comparison is n't really very informative . 
  then there 's the non-monetary benefits of not needing to worry about healthcare when you 're already struggling to feed yourself . 
  i 'd guess first two . 
  he does n't strike me as having an anti-polish agenda or dumb . 
  ignorant , slip of the tongue , an agenda , or being dumb . 
  the eu is also impressive given that less than 100 years ago it was constantly in some brutal wars and has lately mostly come together to cooperate . 
  the gdp would be higher if the eu federalised into one country and could promote wealth and growth more evenly i expect . 
  depends on which measure you use . 
  the un one puts the eu higher for example . 
  they 're in the same ballpark in all of them and a huge distance from the 3rd place . 
  also by ppp it 's china # 1 and eu # 2 in all . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ), 
  correct , but it remains true _ right now _ , which was obviously implicit . 
  the eu and us economy are roughly equal in size ( but not per capita ) . 
  a fact a lot of people do n't realise . 
  i 've been told that asimov 's works are a good read . 
  once i 'm done with my current book i 'll go for it , thanks . 
  in my proposal i was thinking the ai would only make decisions on topics where it has enough evidence or theory to make a decision . 
  for example on the topic of drugs there is evidence in some countries that decriminalisation works . 
  it 's not concrete but a trial could be proposed by it to gather more information . 
  i ca n't , from the top of my head , think of any law or area of society it would n't weigh in on . 
  almost all government decisions i can think of have some kind of measurable impact . 
  we could feed it moral guidance through an elected council . 
  that way it is fully informed , if it ca n't already learn moral systems , and i convinced ai could learn moral systems if taught them . 
  there are subtleties but it largely comes down to a set of rules and weights on actions . 
  perhaps . 
  if the ai can make `` correct '' decisions when fed the entire world of information then it would be the best option . 
  correct is obviously hard to define but anyone _ smart _ will agree that approving climate change measures , not going on unwinnable or pointless wars , focusing on rehabilitation , and other similar decisions would be an ai that would trump the existing governments . 
  though pragmatically having actually worked with ai and studied it , i am pretty sure this is so far off i 'm basically writing the premise to sci-fi . 
  not just in tech , but in popular acceptance . 
  they usually drop to raw numbers at that point entirely ignorant about how stats works . 
  a 2 % lead is tiny * proportionally * . 
  if the world did a vote on sunexit and it won by a 30m i am sure most can agrre it is n't about the absolute number but the amount of the people affected proportionally that matters . 
  my ideal technocracy would be one where the human element is increasingly removed , but that is essentially science fiction right now . 
  a technocracy can still have a voting system by the way , it just requires certain other qualifications to allow one to stand for vote . 
  a degree would be a good start in modern society . 
  of course , populism would kill that in reality . 
  i have lately lost my faith in democracy . 
  i will still campagin but i will support thw first technocrats that have a serious chance . 
  we need experts , not regular people and not career politicians , in power . 
  what is your point ? 
  i disagree with referendums no matter the outcome . 
  it does n't make a mite of a difference whether it would lead to one result or another now or in the past . 
  as for a referendum to change the voting system , okay , that has some logic in it because it changes the fundamental aspect of our democracy , but leaving the eu is way way beyond that . 
  i am in the uk and i 'm against us right now . 
  i was calming down to the idea of a soft brexit , but this just riled me back up again . 
  i have more to offer this country than it does me ; i pay a shit load of tax and could earn a lot more else where , the stability and access to the eu and generally a strong passport were a good trade off . 
  finding a country with lower taxes and more social stability is not hard , i just did n't _ need _ to before because the uk was a comfortable option . 
   most are your typical upper middle class college graduates . 
  i work in finance and a lot of people in these roles went to russel group unis . 
  not eton though , that 's largely reserved for the seriously elite . 
  i work in finance and the general view of the people i work with is that it 's not going to be a huge exodus . 
  frankfurt is also not an attractive location . 
  i have no idea why it keeps being thrown about . 
  i already had a low opinion of this country , i wanted to leave a long time ago but ended up living here with my ( foreign ) wife and realised the uk had a lot to offer and i had a lot to offer it . 
  now i feel it 's a one way relationship . 
  i have far more to offer now , and if my expectations of a post-brexit britain come to be , it 'll be even worse . 
  my wife and i are going on multi-country trips now to find a new home . 
  i 'm paying 40 % tax on a significant chunk of my income for the privilege of being here and really do n't see it as worth it . 
  it 's not my opinion , it 's my conclusion based on the evidence . 
  i am claiming it as fact that we should n't have had the referendum . 
  direct democracy is not safe form of government . 
  win or lose it was a bad idea because it left a huge decision to people that are easily manipulated and tricked ( both ways ) into using feelings over cold hard facts . 
  i 'd say the same about any referendum . 
  i said the same about the scottish one ( which i was remain for as well ) . 
  i am consistent here .
