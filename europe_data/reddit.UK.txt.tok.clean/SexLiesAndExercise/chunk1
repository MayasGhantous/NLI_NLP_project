thanks , i work out and it gets me laid a lot . 
  actually . . this legitimately applies to pretty much every ideology . 
  * bloody humans . 
  as a liberal : * bloody liberals . 
  you 'll definitely have problems finding work here if that 's your understanding of british humour . 
  mmm yeasty evidence . 
  apart from the fact that ` oriental ' is seen as non-pc these days , it refers to east-asian people , i.e. 
  chinese , japanese , korean . 
  [ `` the orient '' . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orient ), 
  you 're right . 
  if only someone had the technical know how to schedule a meeting to fire him !, 
  guys , do n't make fun of him . 
  sometimes he even puts his own appointments into his calendar using his iphone . 
  well , technically they could * both * be in the minority . 
  political beliefs are n't binary !, 
  probably not , because it 's complete shite . 
  * googling intensifies * [ no mention here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/academic_boycotts_of_israel#united_kingdom ) , or [ here ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hebrew+banned+university&amp;oq=hebrew+banned+university&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3000j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=utf-8 ) , or [ here ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hebrew+banned+university&amp;oq=hebrew+banned+university&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3000j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=utf-8#q=boycott+hebrew+language ) . 
  hugely disappointed i missed that opportunity . 
  yeah , fair enough !, 
  i expect you mean jail in the uk is the better option ? 
  from what the article says , they could go and live in relative peace but poverty with their extended family in countries like pakistan , or come and face an indeterminate jail sentence in the uk . 
  faced with those options , i actually do n't know what i 'd pick . 
  they 've evidently realised what they 've given up , so the choice is : 1 . 
  spend x years in a shitty prison here , and get out with a criminal record and shitty prospects , but in the uk ( yay , the uk ) . 
  resign themselves to a pretty shitty life compared to the one they had in the uk , with an outside chance off x years in an even worse prison in pakistan ( pakistan , boo ) . 
  basically , due to their own choices they are now faced with two very nasty possible outcomes . 
  i believe the appropriate aphorism is '' * stuck * between a rock and a hard place '' . 
  i 've heard that they did it as a get-out clause . 
  if they were n't happy with anything , they could back out of the contract / payment as one of the clauses int he contract was n't met . 
  this has the same intended effect , however , of ensuring the organizer actually pays attention to the contract . 
  this is my favourite thread of the day . 
  can it , though ? 
  * can it * not into existnce ? 
  it 's a very relaxing country , but the 3-hour customs queue to use the bathroom is terrible for tourism . 
  rats . 
  i declare my bedroom an independent nation state and request full membership to the eu . 
  where do you draw the line ?!, 
  i can probably help on and off from wednesday onwards . 
  i 'm a pro-yes scot living in london , if you 're looking for an insider-outside-looking in . 
  not if you massively undervalue it when you sell it ... 
  not necessarily irrelevant , but it definitely does n't change the fact that it 's not the best thing to do . 
  even weirder to me is that europeans did n't have tomatoes until we brought them back from the americas . 
  they did n't become a staple of mediterranean food until a couple hundred years ago . 
  to be fair , most nations were n't sitting directly between opposing superpowers in two world wars . 
  the brains in spain drain mainly via plane ? 
  awww yiss . 
  [ i 'll take your input * right * on board , 1-day old account guy . 
  it 's news that 's * particularly * relevant to europe . 
  sorry if europe has an anti-russia feeling going on right now , they happen to be conducting a shadow invasion of a european country and instituting an ( apparently completely useless ) embargo on european food exports . 
  because it 's news . 
  russia is circumventing its own trade embargo on the eu by buying through a conduit . 
  that is n't propaganda , it 's straight-up factual reporting on events that are relevant to european political current affairs . 
  he who swears , wins ? 
  somehow i do n't think putin still has commanders ... 
  i 'm growing , i 'm growing !, 
  for real , but the parallels it draws to old school cultural and racial superiority in british imperial colonialism are * glaring . 
  i think putin and his thugs bullying them is a given , it 's the not shutting down part he 's surprised at . 
  pretty calm ocean though . 
  the mediterranean is a common route and you can follow the spanish coast . 
   at any rate , ** i think he means ** he 's about to invade the ukraine under the auspices of defending the oppressed citizens . 
  i was clarifying what the poster before you meant , not making any kind of political point or judgement whatsoever . 
  ca n't tell if serious . 
  at any rate , i think ~ ~ he ~ ~ / u/kuklachev means ~ ~ he 's ~ ~ putin 's about to invade the ukraine under the auspices of defending the oppressed citizens . 
  christ . 
  if that 's him , it 's * extremely * identifiable . 
  that 's the sort of thing that gets your source killed . 
  picture [ seems to have been removed . 
  ] ( http://www.corriere.it/english/14_luglio_22/how-malaysian-plane-was-shot-down-51e99c60-118f-11e4-affb-3320a03d21e8.shtml ), 
  i was half expecting a video of a sam cutting off a people carrier and then running a tractoroff the road at a busy intersection , shot from the dashboard of a 20 year old saab driven by an inexplicably nonchalant russian man . 
  what if i just freeze my wife ? 
  also , i can pretty much buy as much candy as i can physically carry with the money in my pocket right now . 
  things like chocolate that are literally a luxury in the third world are * incredibly * cheap here , relative to the minimum wage you will be paid for an hour of work . 
  the organisation behind the study : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_fund seems fairly legit . 
  the only inherent ` bias ' seems to be that they place a relatively high value on equity of care , i.e. 
  the availability of healthcare to as many people possible . 
  this does n't tend to be a value-judgement in most places ( it 's taken for granted in the uk ) , but i could see it being an issue of contention for the american right . 
  those are subcategories of the very broad term you 're using . 
  combined , they are indicators that make up `` overall quality of care '' . 
  he 's just pointing out that the protections we have in place were only put there via democracy - they are n't magically protected from being removed . 
  the uk government is [ currently trying ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/10612464/david-cameron-puts-human-rights-at-centre-of-euro-election-plan.html ) to remove us from the eu convention of human rights . 
   a democracy is three wolves and a lamb voting to remove themselves from any lamb-protection treaties they have signed , and then voting on what to eat for dinner . 
  in the usa they have made amendments to their constitution , and their supreme court decides on the interpretation of the constitution on a case-by-case basis . 
  democracy is the best we 've got , but it 's not perfect and it * certainly * does n't inherently protect everyone . 
  jk rowling is famously pro-tax , charitable and uncorrupted by money . 
  she has been extremely outspoken in her support of the welfare and benefits system , which she relied on for a few years as a single motnher before harry potter was published . 
  also it 's heavily implied in the first that the hogwarts express leaves london and goes really far north through mountains and shit . 
  if there 's one thing scotland has , it 's * mountains and shit * . 
  a good starting point is the phenomenal film ` philomena ' with judy dench and steve coogan . 
   `` free trade is a policy in ** international ** markets in which governments do not restrict ** imports or exports ** '' not cabbage in the streets , you muppet . 
  educate yourself . 
  an opinion is worthless if you have n't thought it through . 
   nationalism has only existed since a couple hundred years ago how do you mean ? 
  surely nationalism is as old as the concept of community and the existence of nations ? 
  and the eu has only become larger and taken on more responsibilities since then . 
  the cost of bureaucracy is unfortunately one of the burdens of democracy . 
  ah , the old reddit swi, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  gold mines ? 
  no wonder the ukraine has budget issues .
