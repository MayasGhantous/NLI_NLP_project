   ski jumping is bad for the female body do you * want * your uterus to fall out ? 
  but they do n't pay it with tax right now , so initially the tax will would rise even though overall public and private spending combined had declined . 
  definitely in accordance with the law , but could be construed as unfair to people who took a job under the impression that the 30 % work subsidy would continue . 
  talented too !,

  gypsies love dags . 
  shall i , as a journalist , report the surrounding questions to give the reader their own sense of context ? 
  i 'll just misinterpret them myself and smugly tell the reader that they should n't need to read it . 
  go fuck yourself , new statesman . 
  * twice * as legit !, 
  some of the solutions humans have come up with to bizarre problems are wonderful . 
  building entire islands to make up for a lack of land , building entire artificial lakes with phenomenally huge dams . 
  the stairs to the top of the vatican dome . 
  i also love [ this askreddit thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1jt38k/what_is_the_most_ingenious_solution_to_a_problem/ ) about clever solutions to fairly everyday problems . 
  we seem to have two seasons in scotland . 
  a three month summer and a nine month winter .

  here are the wikipedia pages for each and their industrial uses . 
  i 'm in no way an expert , so any extra context would be much appreciated . 
  [ sodium fluoride ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sodium_fluoride#applications ) : water fluoridation , toothpaste , cleaning agents , medical imaging . 
  [ potassium fluoride ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potassium_fluoride ) [ [ alternate page ] ( http://www.potassiumfluoride.com/uses.html ) ] : tin plating , soldering , polyurethane manufacture , pesticides , disinfectants . 
  i dunno , it does n't necessarily have to be a racist/nationalist thing , people just tend to stick with what they know . 
  i attribute that more to ignorance than xenophobia . 
  honestly , i do n't think this question is particularly loaded . 
  america has a history of placing high value on individual freedoms , this is designed to test whether the population still meets that expectation . 
  it 's a cultural difference , and i 'm sure the americans who answered ` freedom to pursue life 's goals ' would n't see that as a negative . 
  that 's your own bias . 
  what was most interesting about that one was that when broken down by demographic ( [ picture 11 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1qo6m4x.png ) ) , the 50 + age group tends to think their culture is superior far more often , with the percentage dropping off as you get younger . 
  britain , on the other hand , has 38 % of 18-29 year olds , * and * 38 % of 50 + , with a huge dip in the middle . 
  only 20 % of 30-49 year olds . 
  so for a lovely 20 year period , all our kids turned out less nationalistic , and then we ruined it again !, 
  because the question was which do you value higher . 
  if you * had * to choose , which is more important . 
  it 's an individualism vs socialism sort of thing . 
  obviously they can complement each other , but it 's interesting to see what people choose when they have to . 
  it really is n't . 
  look , while that was obviously outrageous it has * nothing * to do with this , and claiming it does weakens * both * arguments by making you seem incapable of contextualising news stories .

  to be honest he even managed to skip a rothschild reference in to his big conspiracy theory ramble so i 'm not taking it as much more than your standard internet tinfoil hat manifesto . 
  yeah , he did n't exactly set it up very well by stating that the sole source of evidence the bbc lied was :  the iranian propaganda channel no potential bias there , then ? 
  checked your post history . 
  * wow * , am i glad i do n't have your pathetic life !, 
  have you been on reddit much ? 
  it is literally almost every day you see a reference to snatch . 
  might be nice to actually try that stage out , rather than skipping right to the ` jail without any evidence ' part . 
  how would you feel if you got convicted of terrorism based on the word of two convicts , with no tangible evidence ? 
   oh , if there was any evidence of my innocence they 'd just throw it out anyway . 
  best that there is n't any . 
  off i go to jail , it 's a fair cop . 
  i do n't think so .

  well then we 'll have a revolutionary war of independence . 
  calling them pro life and pro choice implicitly sets them up to call each other anti life and anti choice .

  is there a godwin 's law for diagnosing people as sociopaths ? 
  i swear it 's the most consistent trope among people of all ages . 
  as soon as someone has read the definition of a sociopath , they personally know ten of them , and anyone they dislike is probably a sociopath , and the milkman * definitely * has autism . 
  i believe the documentary ` hostel ' deals with how dangerous eastern europe is .

  if your teenage daughter goes to paris she will be kidnapped in cdg airport , forcefully addicted to heroin and sold into sex slavery . 
  one of them is still in a coma and looks like she will be paralysed from the waist down . 
  definitely a serious injury that could have killed her if she was n't immediately rushed to hospital . 
  true , but the top comment we were discussing was really about it being creative . 
  i ca n't argue that it is n't funny to * someone * , but i can argue it is n't creative , and not biting social commentary . 
  no , but a big component of humour is something being unexpected , * especially * in political or social commentary jokes . 
  if it 's edgy / taboo / controversial , it can also make it funnier . 
  at this point , when i open a comic about the catholic church , my default expectation is a pedo joke . 
  when it 's as generic , uninspired and predictable as this , it 's hard to find it funny * or * interesting . 
  i mean i could draw a picture of david cameron with a literal penis for a head , and it would be a message understood by everybody . 
  would n't make it biting social commentary . 
   i do n't care what the snp 's polices are  i just think the snp is toxic * why ? 
  * i 'm not trying to be obstinate , but do you have a legitimate reason ? 
  full disclosure : i voted snp today and lib dem last time , but would have to see serious changes in the labour party to vote for them . 
  i 'm no labour fan , but i can see that they 're * at least * on the left side of the tories , and would be * ecstatic * if the result was a labour government moderated by the stronger left wing push of the snp . 
  do you not see that as a likely outcome , or do we just disagree that it would be good if labour moved further to the left ? 
  well you 've certainly found the right party for you . 
  new labour : fuck what 's best for britain , as long as we 're running it .
