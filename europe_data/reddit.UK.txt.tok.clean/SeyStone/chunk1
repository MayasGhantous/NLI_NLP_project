do you not find it humorous that - according to the poll - most french people want the uk to leave the eu ? 
  well after turkey gets in , who knows . 
   52 % of french voters were in favour ** of the uk ** withdrawing from the eu . 
  why do you think we have laws ? 
  i know , and i hope we continue to contravene it in this way . 
  the thing is , a generally see the laws of my country to be just today , so i think few people imprisoned are there unfairly . 
   is that so ? 
  i have never heard of it before . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/12/uk-prisoners-banned-voting-echr http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31356895 it 's not stopped the european court of human rights trying to interfere with it though . 
  they could n't have voted if they were prisoners ... prisoners have never been able to vote in the uk . 
  well i do n't think people who disrespect the law so much they are imprisoned should be allowed the vote , no . 
  prisoners in the uk can not vote : http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/12/uk-prisoners-banned-voting-echr, 
  are gay people still criminals ? 
   what about people who have no respect for current drug/traffic/animal welfare legislation and want to see a change in the law ? 
  what about them ? 
  who is removing the `` right to vote '' from anyone ? 
  prisoners ca n't currently vote in the uk . 
  generally i do n't think people who have actively worked to harm society , who do n't have respect for the laws of the land should be consulted in how the land is run . 
  ending open borders can only help . 
  and we ca n't say that 3 billion people would try to move to europe , nowhere near all the people in africa right now are trying to get to europe . 
  we can focus on both , it 's not a one or the other issue . 
  and 3 billion is a bit of an exaggerated number . 
  are implying that talking about differences between immigrants and natives is racist ? 
   i know spain has about half more like two thirds . 
   not sure on poland . 
  a bit more than half . 
  * lol , what ? 
  they 're, 
  well , that is there job after all . 
  some people might not think that 's what they do , but that is their aim . 
  because the uk government works in our interest . 
  well then do n't make a defensive alliance if you 're not prepared to contribute to it yourself . 
  https://content.ncetm.org.uk/images/microsites/primary_magazine/issue_30/30_2.jpg not that close , but then again greenland is n't that close to mainland denmark either . 
  why ? 
   the tories barely undulate around 30 % the tories got 37 % of the vote . 
  there 's a stereotype of british women being rather ugly , especially compared to women on the continent . 
  it 's mostly just said in a joking way though . 
   propelled the uk forwards into a modern global economy  also got re-elected 5 years after the falklands war ftf ** y **, 
   every value is universal then . 
  no , not really . 
  the enlightenment was quite universal in the value systems it produced , and christianity was too to a degree previous to the enlightenment . 
  but racism or sexism is n't a universal value system , they do n't advocate for the same universal rights for all people . 
  losing to the british at everything important . 
   we are no longer in the xviii century . 
  which is why we 're only second , 
   you ca n't stop murders , what you can do is stop safe legal murders ... 
  i do n't really like it . 
  it 's fine for continental countries i guess , but it 's not for the uk . 
  no , because `` freedom to be a dick '' can also incorporate actions other than words . 
  where do you live ? 
  do you approve of pis ? 
  i doubt you can be truly conservative and pro-eu . 
  berwick upon tweed is a town in england that used to be in scotland . 
  hmm , could do with getting berwick back . 
  yeah , ewan maccoll who wrote it was from salford . 
  in the rare old times , dirty old town and whiskey in the jar are all classics . 
  also love seven drunken nights ( only the first five verses of course !, 
  ) , and of course the rebel songs come out ye black and tans and men behind the wire ( and also go on home british soldiers and irish soldier laddie ) . 
  other great ones are [ wild rover ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siqtzri5w88 ) , [ the irish rover ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thdx9qb2-bq ) and [ the belle of belfast city ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un2kxwxphka ) . 
  and of course songs like [ let the people sing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulmqglmipju ) , and who could forget , [ the fields of athenry !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luoyyhlzeqk ) and then of course i can add the pogues , who are one of my favourite bands although technically being from england , with [ thousands are sailing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc1g7acpssi ) , [ if i should fall from grace with god ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bsif-x1ttk ) and [ a pair of brown eyes . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=421pzgg-vly ), 
   authoritarianism is sign of weakness , not strength . 
  i 'd be interested why you say this . 
  nobody said they were . 
  it would go from 10 european militaries to two ; the french and british . 
  because the uk and europe as a whole have very different needs and ideas about foreign policy and defence , and i do n't trust european politicians to do better than british ones in setting policy in these areas . 
  what is the significance of being pregnant ? 
  how is the fetus endangering the pregnant woman only by virtue of being in the womb ? 
  what 's the difference between dependency in a newborn and a child that is unborn ? 
  so it still ca n't survive independently, 
   it can survive independently no it ca n't . 
  a newborn is totally dependent on their mother . 
  why answer a question with a question instead of properly answering the original question ? 
   it 's also better to save the child from a shit upbringing or a mother who does n't want it why is it ? 
  that 's not an argument to legalise abortion . 
  they are human , they have human dna . 
  why is it ? 
  does the same hold true for a newborn ? 
   ancestor of charlemagne was lee really that old ? 
  uk fees are n't like normal debt . 
  if you earn over a certain amount a percentage gets deducted from your wages to pay the debt off , and if you have n't paid it off after 30 years ( no matter if you 've already paid 99 % of it or none ) it gets completely wiped . 
  yes , you 'll find we 've done more than japan has done . 
  nafta is a larger trading bloc than the eu . 
  better that than part of the united states of europe . 
  sad to see the dutch pm does n't really about his country 's independence when there 's economic liberalisation and globalisation to be done . 
  according to this source : http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/british.htm ireland 's population in 1841 was 8.2 million , with the whole uk ( including ireland ) having a population of 26.9 million . 
  this would give ireland 30.5 % of the uk 's population . 
  really interesting to see how each ireland , scotland and england have changed in population relative to each other since then . 
  not quite an era though . 
  do n't really know if it brought in an era of liberty though . 
  it 's a poor understanding of the term `` united '' to automatically assume it refers to multiple countries , when it does no such thing . 
   the united states is so called because it is a union of 50 separate states , and the united arab emirates are so called because they are a union of seven different emirates . 
  * that is the point that i 've been making . 
  *  pleased to meet you scottish , i 'm dad . 
  so clearly not an englishman `` viewing the other nations of the union as exotic extensions of england '' , would n't you agree ? 
   you ushered an era of liberty to europe ? 
  chorister is a primary school . 
  fettes is n't a university , it 's the secondary boarding school that blair attended . 
  blair went to university in oxford , not edinburgh .
