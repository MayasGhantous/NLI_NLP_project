  there 's [ r/wales ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wales ) & [ r/cardiff ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cardiff ) ( the capital ) , which are reasonably active . 
  as for the meaning of merthyr , personally i do n't really know that much welsh , but my friend says the name means `` town of saint tudful '' . 
  apparently in modern welsh it means `` martyr '' . 
  ( according to wikipedia at least ), 
  in wales : newport is seen as a bit of a dump , the city 's only notable attraction and landmark is a [ * bridge * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newport_transporter_bridge ) . 
  [ ( though it is a pretty cool one to be honest ) . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/newport_transporter_bridge_2002.jpg ) in terms of towns , merthyr tydfil probably wins for just utter deprivation . 
  like a lot of valley towns , it never really recovered from the mine closures of the 1980 's . 
  a large percentage of the population are unemployed . 
  port talbot is probably one of the most depressing places in the uk , the town is on a hill [ looking over ] ( http://i2.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article1871542.ece/alternates/s615/port-talbot-275909481.jpg ) an [ enormous steelworks ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/68197725@n02/7201568032 ) , and has a [ large motorway ] ( http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/government+report+claims+air+pollution+kills+z0phsrbsnral.jpg ) cutting right though the middle of it . 
  [ ( rather unceremoniously ) ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.599086,-3.789157,3a,75y,316.2h,87.47t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s17pjec7ebmyu5cntydj_9q!2e0 ) . 
  there 's also been a [ lot of worries ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/port-talbots-black-dust-plague-5583035 ) about air pollution and health problems due to the aforementioned steelworks . 
  but hey , at least they have some jobs over there . 
  edit : on the other end of the scale , lots of people i know in cardiff think [ penarth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penarth ) is full of rich bastards with big houses and sports cars . 
  ( not entirely untrue . . ), 
  seeing as you 've got a high speed line going from holyhead to liverpool , would it make any sense to have a high speed line that goes from cardiff to bangor along the coast ? 
  seeing as this is [ already a proposed railway line ] ( http://www.railfuture.org.uk/article_image.php?image_type=article&amp;id=1444 ) ( though not high speed of course ) which would connect some of wales ' main towns and cities such as swansea , aberystwyth & bangor . 
  in wales we have [ welsh cakes ] ( http://recipewise.co.uk/media/welsh-cakes.jpg ) , which are absolutely amazing .

  do n't worry nadine , at least the berlin wall will stop those pesky east germans from coming here . 
  there 's this pretty good documentary about it called [ videograms of a revolution ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stm8yvuplue ) , which documents the revolution using hours of amateur footage and news footage . 
  some people think that spain will refuse eu membership of an independent scotland , so to discourage catalonian independence ( assuming scotland would have to reapply for eu membership ) . 
  someone also uploaded nearly 15 minutes worth of bbc news footage during the time the berlin wall fell , it 's surprisingly interesting : [ part 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjnz1lvxgzu ) , [ part 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fflt46jweje ), 
  and over here in wales , though they cost only 5p ( $ 0.06 i think ) so most people end up buying the bags anyway it seams . 
  i like how there 's one incredibly right-wing , authoritarian person in the top right corner . 
  it 's come to the point where the [ eu have set up a blog on their website ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/blog/ ) dedicated to pointing all the misinformation tabloids in the uk like the sun and the daily mail print about the eu . 
  [ here 's a pdf they link to in the article that compares uk opinions with the rest of the eu27 ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/eurobarometre/2013/election/eb79.5%20ep%20eurobarometer%20uk%20 ( en \\ ) . pdf ) ( plus lots of pie charts and graphs . ), 
  i find it a bit sad that so many people in the uk seam to have a much more negative opinion on the eu then on average . 
  also , interesting how people in the uk think that terrorism is a much more serious problem then the rest of europe , along with immigration . 
  they stopped selling their vodka to westerners so that they can focus on building their nuclear warheads , did n't you hear ? 
  those evil commies !, 
  i did n't realise it was still the cold war . 
  i 'd love to see what japan would do for the opening ceremony .

  ] ( http://venturevillage.eu/eu-data-roaming-scrapped ), 
  causalities ? 
  i do n't think the rise in sea levels will happen * that * quickly , it 's something that happens over the course of years/decades , not hours/days . 
  commieblocks, 
  i 'm surprised how high germany is . 
  it might be nice to make a section on the sidebar for things like this as well , to make easier to get to . 
  i guess on a bit of a lighter note , i 've always felt like there should be a kind of pan-european tv channel , a bit like euronews , but with a focus on entertainment , eg , european drama , documentaries ; maybe also some bits foreign news networks etc. 
  the shows would be shown in there original languages , of course , and like euronews the viewer is able to pick from different languages for the subtitles . 
  i think it would be a cool idea at least , there is a lot of good european tv shows , like borgen and les revenants , and a lot of it does n't really make it 's way across the continent . 
  i guess the other thing that could be quite good is if foreign tv channels start being transmitted in other countries - opening up the market a bit , though i imagine there would be a lot of licensing issues that would have to be sorted out to make this possible , plus everything would have to be subtitled multiple times into other languages which could be a pain . 
  also subtitles for foreign tv shows like borgen , the returned ( les revenants ) , the killing ( forbrydelsen ) etc. 
  stricter data protection laws to start with . 
  as in , actually start enforcing them on companies that work within the eu , weather they 're from an eu country or not . 
  ... still underwater . 
  i wonder why iceland does n't have it . 
  meh , iceland has volcanoes , it does n't get any better then that . 
  ( unless you want to fly in a plane that is . ), 
  we need to get that [ guy who redesigned the coins ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ytptkmx.jpg ) to have a look at it . 
  you know , i kind of wish there was some kind of pan european tv channel , kind of like euronews , but dedicated to things like dramas , documentary shows etc from different countries in europe . 
  ( with a selection of subtitles in different languages ), 
  did n't know i stumbled into r/politics, 
  so is hong kong and the czech republic it seems . 
  aww , but then we 'll lose the [ really cool and unique looking coins we have !, 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a8/new_british_coinage_2008.jpg ), 
  the second poster looks like it was made with clip art . 
  oh god is the tree playing dubstep ? 
  would you say that the faroe islands is n't a country ? 
  it 's not a sovereign state , but it 's a country in the kingdom of denmark with a devolved government , just like scotland , wales and northern ireland are countries within the united kingdom , with devolved governments . 
  few would suggest that it is n't a country in its own right , it even has its own iso country code . 
  ( why they get to have one and not us is a good question though , seeing as the situation is reasonably similar . ), 
  of course * unilaterally * declaring independence is illegal in most countries , but apparently in russia just having separatist * views * is illegal , you could be imprisoned for simply campaigning for independence for your region . 
  that 's very different . 
  in many countries ( such as the uk ) there 's nothing illegal about the concept of a region becoming independent so long as a referendum can be agreed with the central government , and separatism is a relatively moderate , perhaps even mainstream view in many places just like any other ideology such as liberalism , socialism , conservatism , etc. 
  i mean the snp is the third largest party in the uk parliament after all . 
  did they find them in a river ? 
  he looks like daniel craig . 
   regional dialect right . 
  also if we 're going on the `` world language '' argument , why not just scrap spanish lessons completely and just teach everyone english ? 
  or mandarin ? 
  i suppose , the idea of power-sharing was to make sure that both sides had their voices heard , but it has n't exactly been a massive success by the look of it . 
  it would be fantastic if northern ireland had `` normal politics '' one day , but i ca n't really see that happen any time soon , and i 'm not sure if a traditional parliament system would help that or just make the situation far worse , the last thing we want to see is one of the sides returning to violence . 
  the country is far too divided between what is essentially a ethnic-religious line for normal politics to work - catholics will never vote for one of the unionist parties , protestants will never vote for one of the nationalist parties , it does n't really have much to do with politics unfortunately . 
  because there 's more protestants then catholics , the catholic/nationalist side will just be in eternal opposition , and the protestant/unionist side will be in eternal governance , unless the demographics of the country changes ( but then it would just be the other way around ) . 
  the question is , what happens if the catalan government refuses ? 
  if they 've already declared themselves an independent country then telling them to shut down their government is n't going to do much unless you send in the military or something . 
  there 's also ireland , which declared independence from the uk in a * very * similar way that catalonia might do - [ using an election as a de-facto independence referendum . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_general_election,_1918 ), 
   more autonomy for nations in europe . 
  [ but not more autonomy for the nations in the uk it seams . 
  ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/most-people-wales-not-want-9887283 ), 
  i guess i support it on a cultural level - if wales had become independent sometime in the 19th century when it was still a pretty prosperous country that could support itself many times over then i would n't be calling it to become part of the uk again , and i doubt many people would either . 
  it 's really a question of economics , wales could n't support itself on it 's own like scotland could since we have no self-sustainable economy nowadays . 
  we also do n't have the infrastructure ( railways , roads etc ) or the industries to get one . 
  but i definitely support far more devolved powers , the only way things are going to change over here is if we have more control over our country , control over our taxes , infrastructure and all the other important things . 
  we still need money from british state to support us however - but hopefully one day that wo n't be necessary , and surely that 's should be main goal for any politician here . 
  so basically , yes , but only when we can sustain ourselves to a reasonable degree .
