  some people do , but i imagine most do n't know anything about it and do n't really have an opinion , no idea what carwyn jones thinks of it either . 
  it 's a bit shit that spain refuses to allow a proper referendum on the thing like with scotland , but if spain decides to send tanks into barcelona or something after a udi then i imagine they 'll get quite a bit of sympathy here . 
  [ it 's mostly about 10-15 % usually . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_independence#support ) a couple of polls by icm around the time of the scottish referendum showed it it to be much lower , but there 's so little polling on the matter it 's difficult to gauge exactly how many people support it , especially if the question also has `` greater devolved powers '' as an option ( virtually everyone who supports independence is going to pick that since it 's a far more obtainable thing ) . 
  it also seams like you get a different answer every time it 's asked . 
  edit : it was a bit disingenuous by the bbc to say that welsh independence is at a `` record low '' when the poll in question also had an option for `` greater powers '' , unlike some of the other polling . 
  i imagine if you gave people in scotland the same poll you 'll also find that scottish independence is at a `` record low '' as well . 
  it 's more then just coontown . 
  he 's been picking mushrooms in a forest , i imagine that 's probably already happened . 
  oh yeah , i forgot all the millions of people that were killed by clement attlee 's 1945 government . 
  what a terrible person , building the welfare state and creating a national health service free at the point of use , truly horrible . 
  are you even real . 
  ah right , my mistake , i was speaking about the events back in 2013 when the us government were deciding on whether to send airstrikes over the assad regime when it was reported that he had been using chemical weapons ; i thought he eventually went through with that but it does n't seam like that was the case , i think that 's right ? 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  you either commit to it fully ( which equals spending all that money to make sure the country does not de-stabilise itself again ) or you do n't bother . 
  these nations were stable when the old state was in power . 
  we helped destroy that state , and this is the inevitable consequence of that . 
  it becomes less inevitable the more money and time you pump into it . 
  we did n't pump any money into it at all , which lead to a destabilised state . 
  yes , but what did we do after that ? 
  *** absolutely fuck all . 
  *** we intervened to topple gaddafi in the hope that the rebels would then create a new democratic state , america ( thankfully not the uk ) intervened in an attempt to topple assad , in the hope that the rebels would then create a new democratic state . 
  neither of these happened . 
  and of course they did n't , revolutions are never as simplistic and hollywood-like as that . 
  as soon as the state collapsed we just buggered off . 
  we had just ** bombed a country ** , yet we offered the absolute minimum of help . 
  where was the infrastructure investment ? , where was the investment in internal security ? , policing ? , where was the educational , health , economic investment ? 
  you ca n't say it 's the state 's responsibility , * we just destroyed the state . 
  * that 's the problem . 
  bombing the country is the easiest part . 
  what happens next is * far , far * more important and * far , far * more investment needs to be spent to be spent on that part . 
  the as soon as the bombs fall , the western governments have a responsibility for whatever happens next , and they need to make sure that the country becomes completely stabilised not just for a few years , but for decades onwards . 
  we should have had people stationed in those countries , for humanitarian reasons , for decades onwards . 
  we should have had a long term , 5 , 10 , 20 + year plan for it . 
  we should have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on them . 
  * we did nothing * , and we pretend as though that was all that was required from us . 
  [ the uk government spent 13 times more bombing libya than on rebuilding post war . 
  ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13499912.uk_government_spent_13_times_more_bombing_libya_than_on_rebuilding_post_war/ ) that figure should be the other way around . 
  otherwise we might as well not have bothered , because anything less would only make the situation far worse , as we can see right now . 
  it would probably help if european/western countries did n't constantly bomb the middle east all the time . 
  i mean look what happened in libya , we bombed the country to help the revolution , packed up as soon as was over and gave them absolutely no help * at all * to re-stabilise their country . 
  we left them to pick up the pieces . 
  and for some reason we act surprised that the country destabilised again and terrorist groups like isis emerged . 
  the same thing happened with syria . 
  europe and america are at least partly to blame for this , so it is partly their responsibility . 
  [ they were also the paper that printed this . 
  ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2851536/images/o-axelrod-facebook.jpg ), 
  ireland 's a bit smaller then i remember it ... 
  [ only two polls did actually ( ignoring a couple of iffy ones near the start of the campaign ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#2014 ), 
  it 's always leaking . 
  if the admins had any sense they would have banned those racist subs by now , but `` muh free speech '' and all that . 
  it 's summer , nothing is happening because everyone else is on holiday ( except us sad lot of course ) . 
  i 'm not sure what it 's like in other countries at the moment but currently we 're in silly season in the uk - all the parliaments national and devolved are shut and on holiday , so * absolutely fuck all * is happening , and it shows . 
  this happens yearly , and during this time the news media becomes fixated on the tiny number of small , actually notable issues , and runs with them * every day , every single day * the same headlines . 
  if it 's like this across europe then there we go , that 's probably one of the reasons why the front page looks like that , there 's simply nothing else to discuss so this topic will be milked for what it 's worth , as that 's what the news media in the uk are certainly doing . 
  as far as i 'm concerned the biggest problem the bbc has it that it tends to treat the uk as * england + * . 
  very little time is spent covering what 's happening in the other nations of the uk , even when broadcasting in those nations . 
  they also tend to mistakenly assume that all legislation made in westminster applies throughout the whole of the uk , even though wales , scotland and northern ireland all have their own devolved parliaments and generally make their own laws . 
  issues that predominately effect england tend to be treated as though they 're uk wide , and tend to be broadcast uk-wide , whereas non-english issues are left unreported . 
  the bbc tend to be the least-worst at this though , which says something about the rest of the media . 
  the newspapers do n't even pretend to be anything but english ones . 
  honestly i think the bbc would do well to split itself up , so the bbc 's in each nation has far more autonomy in it 's broadcasting . 
  [ here 's a report made some years ago reviewing the uk 's nation coverage ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/article/art20130702112133668 ) , the findings said : * a large proportion of its stories are vague , confusing or inaccurate * if they do specify countries of application , they tend to do so only once * ` the uk ' , ` britain ' and ` england ' are often used interchangeably * presenters , when talking about england rather than the uk , say ` we ' , ` us ' , ` here ' and ` this country ' * attempts to compare and contrast policies between the nations are rare * coverage of politics across the four nations is often seen through westminster eyes * hardly any legislators in scotland , wales or northern ireland are interviewed on network news * there is little attempt to tackle devolution issues per se , particularly with reference to wales and northern ireland * substantial and important political/policy developments in the nations do not figure on the main bulletins , in particular bbc one 's news at ten * the website is not as user-friendly as it should be on devolution * bbc news is excessively london-centric * reports from elsewhere are about crime , sport and human interest , or the merely quirky * where there are a number of stories of similar weight , the ones nearest london have the best chance of being reported . 
  that was from 2008 . 
  nothing has changed . 
  i know i know , just thought i 'd mention that . 
  and obviously there 's no welsh representation since at the time wales was part of the kingdom of england and such . 
  [ does n't look too bad ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/union_jack_1606_scotland.svg/2000px-union_jack_1606_scotland.svg.png ) might actually prefer this version , looks more modern . 
  edit : still does n't have any northern irish representation , nor welsh representation but that 's to be expected . 
  there 's a bit of scottish in there though !, 
  in the background behind the english flag , of course . 
  if you live in gwynedd then you should be able to live and work only speaking welsh . 
  the council works entirely in the welsh language at least , as is all the schools etc. 
  if they work in [ y fro gymraeg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y_fro_gymraeg ) can they also be fluent in welsh as well ? 
  thanks . 
  devo-max for the moon !, 
  he needs to announce his support for devo max/home rule if he 's going to win back some of those seats . 
  independence is a divided issue , substantial powers for the scottish parliament certainly is n't . 
  only if people in the regions in question supported the idea of independence , then i think they should be offered a referendum on matter . 
  i ca n't exactly see one forthcoming to say the least though . 
  though i would say the same thing for basically any country , and places like catalonia ( for example ) should be offered to right to decide their own destiny through referenda , like scotland was . 
  to hell with constitutions that remove that right . 
  lots more on / r/slowtv, 
  i guess so , but people in northern ireland are entitled to have both a british passport and an irish passport , so it 's a bit different then say , someone who has a french passport . 
  either way i find it a bit strange that apparently `` northern irish '' is a separate ethnic category then `` irish '' , according to the ons . 
  probably based on the census results . 
  it asked two questions on identity : how would you describe your national identity ? 
  * welsh * english * scottish * northern irish * british * other what is your ethnic group ? 
  white : * welsh/english/scottish / northern irish/british * irish * gypsy or irish traveller * other then separate answers for mixed/multiple ethnic groups , asian/asian british , black/african/caribbean / black british and other . 
  interesting that `` irish '' is part of a separate ethnic category rather then a national identity option , separate from `` northern irish '' and british ( and the others ) as well . 
  bit of a weird one . 
  [ here 's the census questionnaires ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/how-our-census-works/how-we-took-the-2011-census/how-we-collected-the-information/questionnaires--delivery--completion-and-return/2011-census-questions/index.html ) ( for wales and england , scotland and northern ireland do their own separate ones ), 
  that man could win an award for `` most condescending sounding person '' . 
  it 's not like it 's possible to have a calm discussion about immigration on reddit anyway , it 'll always just be both sides screaming at each other . 
  that and it just attracts the idiots from those awful hate subs like coontown to come here . 
  i would rather we did n't spend so much time talking about it , it 's a futile discussion that just makes this place more toxic to read . 
  right , this might be a long one : * [ 19-20 % of people speak welsh in wales ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/welsh_speakers_in_the_2011_census.png/924px-welsh_speakers_in_the_2011_census.png ) , it 's certainly a minority but it 's far , far bigger then the amount of people that speak scottish gaelic ( 1.1 % ) or even irish ( although they have more second language speakers , it 's difficult to find statistics on how many of those are fluent ) , and importantly there 's quite a few towns and villages up in the western part of wales where there is a overwhelming majority of first language welsh speakers , 70-80 % + . 
  i was in porthmadog recently and you certainly wo n't hear english being spoken on the street there . 
  ( excluding tourists like us of course ) * it 's true that wales used to be part of the kingdom of england , but for most of modern history wales has been `` ruled '' by england the same way that scotland and northern ireland are , that is , as part of the unitary state that is the uk , where each elected mp has the same amount of say and vote , although england makes up 85 % of it . 
  obviously wales did n't have the power to make it 's own laws before devolution , but neither did scotland , or northern ireland during the time of direct rule .
