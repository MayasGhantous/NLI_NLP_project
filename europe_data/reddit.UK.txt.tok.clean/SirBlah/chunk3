  either way things are obviously a bit more complicated after devolution , and the uk is beginning to look more like a quasi-federal state then a unitary state . 
  * the only reason why scotland could have a referendum on independence is because westminister allowed it , it 's a constitutional issue and therefore completely reserved to the uk government for both the welsh assembly and scottish parliament . 
  the assembly could do the same thing if it wanted to - obviously it wo n't any time in the foreseeable future since there 's not anywhere where near the same level of support for independence , but nothing 's stopping them from proposing one , it 's the uk government which would have to decide whether it happened , like they did when scotland proposed one . 
  `` independence referendums '' are n't a devolved area . 
  * [ we do have our own laws here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_law ) , now if you mean a devolved legal system or a separate jurisdiction , then no , we do n't have one . 
  but the assembly has the ability to make laws and has done so for some time , and certainly does make use of them . 
  [ they have complete control over the 20 devolved subjects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_assembly_for_wales#devolved_areas ) and can make pretty much whatever laws they like for them . 
  [ more info . 
  ] ( http://law.gov.wales/?lang=en ) * and yes , we are british , nobody * really * denies that , the same way that no one in scotland * really * denies that either , assuming british just means `` people who live on the island of great britain '' . 
  in a technical sense scotland would still be british even if they had voted yes last year , even if the state of the uk no longer existed or even never existed in the first place . 
  * but if you were to ask the majority of people where they are from for what their identity is , they will say welsh first , then british second , or just welsh entirely . 
  you 'll find the same thing in scotland and england as well . 
  but you wo n't find people saying they 're welsh and english unless they happened to be born in england and moved to wales or if they have direct family links to england , because england does not equal the uk . 
  chances are people will say they are welsh if they were born in wales and grew up in wales . 
  * either way , people here see wales as a country the same way that scotland and england are , within the union state that is the united kingdom . 
  since all the old `` wales in england '' acts ( wales and berwick etc ) have been repealed many decades ago it really ca n't be considered a part of england any more , no more then scotland or northern ireland can be . 
  you probably do n't want to use that language in the middle of cardiff i can tell you that . 
  the only remaining part from that time is the single legal jurisdiction `` england and wales '' . 
  but even that thing will eventually have to go some day , maybe in the near future , as welsh law and english law inevitably drift apart - wales and england are likely the only two places in the world which have two law making legislatures in one jurisdiction , with every law having to specify which one it applies too . 
  it 's a bit of an oxymoron when you think about it really . 
  i 'd say they 're a mostly liberal leaning paper - in sense of being economically right wing and socially left wing ; they 've supported the lib dems quite a few times , as well as new labour ( but not old labour ) . 
  in the 2015 elections they specifically supported the coalition as it is now , which includes the lib dems and the conservative party . 
  in the us elections they tend to favour the democrats rather then the republicans . 
  indeed , take the uk or instance , many people here have a kind of dual national identity . 
  for example , while lots of people consider themselves to be completely welsh , or completely british , many people would say that they are both welsh and british , some would say they are welsh before british , some might say that they are british before welsh , and others might say they hold both identities equally . 
  and then there 's the regional identity , which can go down to the city/town/village level . 
  this is something that happens in all the countries of the uk , including england . 
  and of course many people also feel european as well , but that is n't something that replaces those identities , it simply becomes another layer added on top which might be felt more strongly or more weakly then the other identities , and perhaps this is something that is n't static but instead changes depending where you are , how you feel currently , etc. 
  in the end someone might say that they identify as a cardiffian , then welsh , british and european , all of them with different levels of strength and importance . 
  ... while 90 % of the people have their country flag as their flair . 
  i feel sad for the children , they do n't deserve this . 
   this is * the * one thing ^ ^ ( we ) did ` nt want * to * happen, 
  [ * cough * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/britain_in_ad500_-_project_gutenberg_etext_16790.jpg ) edit : on a serious note , i would be content with wales having a form of ( proper ) home rule , or devo-max ; a far more powerful senedd with tax raising powers , and the separation of the `` england and wales '' legal jurisdiction , along with most law making powers - leaving only big things like defence and foreign affairs controlled by westminister . 
  and in the long ( long ) term , an independent wales within the eu . 
  but only if , or when , the country is economically stable enough for that , with good enough infrastructure to support itself . 
  also , could do with a bit of a clean up with the border , do we really have to have the border intersecting villages like [ llanymynech ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/llanymynech ) ( where it goes right though the middle of the high street ) ? 
  i guess the netherlands and belgium can deal with that stuff , but still , would n't hurt to have a local referendum on the issue . 
  maybe also do one for the area around oswestry in england , [ seeing as they apparently think of themselves as being pretty welsh . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqms0lucpw0 ), 
  there did used to be a train line that roughly followed where the a470 is now , called the mid wales line - used to go through merthyr to brecon and builth wells etc. 
  up to wrexham ( although it did pop into england for a small bit ) . 
  although if that was rebuilt it would have to have quite a bit of work done to it , making it less curvy and such , and it would also probably have to go left and connect up with the conwy valley line rather then go right into wrexham since that would be a more direct route to the north coast . 
  basically follow the a470 the whole way through . 
  the carmarthen to aber line is also really important as well though , i 'd love to see both lines rebuilt one day . 
  we can thank dr. beeching and his lads for that . 
  he might have damaged the railway network in the rest of the uk , but he absolutely butchered the one in wales . 
  we 're lucky we still have what we 've got now . 
  would be nice if we had a proper railway line from north to south as well . 
  the closest thing is a line which travels directly out of wales and spends most of it 's time in england , popping back in for a bit to serve wrexham then back out , and then stops at chester forcing trains to reverse back into wales again to go across the northern coast . 
  it 's a joke . 
  [ here 's a map of them ] ( http://i.imgur.com/atqyubs.jpg ) , it 's mostly based on the views from different london parks . 
  also you can see that the shard is right in between two sightlines , meaning that so long as the sightlines exist the shard will forever be on its own , unless they build directly behind it . 
  ... while probably paying more then twice as much in fuel cost . 
  169 miles from cardiff to `` wales , south yorkshire '' according to google . 
  this is such a weird thing though , i mean , wales is a pretty small country , but i did n't know it was [ * that * small . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rp7sbznh.jpg ) . 
  looking at it though , it 's made up of rows of small terraced houses , and it looks like in the middle there 's what i think is a [ memorial to the local colliery using part of the old winding wheel ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ljmqkmbh.jpg ) , i 'd say that 's pretty damn welsh . 
  there 's a slight few hills too , but they 're no mountains , and sadly the houses do n't look like either the old terraces in the valleys or the slate ones in the north , and i do n't see any welsh flags dotted around either , or araf 's painted on the ground , so it looses a few marks there . 
  the welsh-english border is particularly convoluted , for example you have villages like llanymynech where the border runs right though the village 's high street - meaning that the village has two police/fire/hospital services , people on one side of the street have free prescriptions and reduced university fees , the other side does n't , one side is represented by a devolved assembly the other side just has the uk government , and any big infrastructure changes ( like say a by-pass ) require the permission of both governments and for them to work together . 
  it 's a bit of a mess . 
  i imagine cameron also thinks a brexit would be a nightmare - he and his party might have planned the referendum but he 's almost certainly going to be campaigning to stay in . 
  it 's a vote to appease ukip and the eurosceptic faction of his party . 
  surprisingly the [ glasgow subway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glasgow_subway ) is 3rd oldest underground metro system , opening in 1896 - [ but it has never been extended since then ] ( http://www.subways.net/uk/glasgmap.jpg ) . 
  although i believe it has been rebuilt and modernised quite a bit over the years . 
  the fact is that it was bound to happen eventually , i certainly do n't want to leave the eu either , but people ca n't just stick their heads in the sand and hope that the eurosceptics will just go away - they wo n't , and refusing to have a referendum will only make the situation worse , with more and more of the population becoming anti-eu . 
  this something that needs to be confronted directly , else a larger percentage of the population of the uk will only become angrier and relations between the institutions more strained . 
  as i say , the conversation has been entirely directed by the right wing media and politicians for years now ( probably partly due to the fact there has n't been consecutive referendums as the union has evolved ) , and even after all that there 's still more people that want to stay in then leave - it 's now for the political parties on the ` stay ' side try and win back more support for the eu and hopefully make the uk 's understanding of the eu stronger , if they achieve that then the question will hopefully remain answered . 
  edit : please do n't mistake the eurosceptic side of the uk as being the only opinion people here have of the eu - there is no `` uk point of view '' : there 's also many people here who want to stay in , even those who want the uk to be further integrated , and opinions on the eu depend where you live within the uk : which of the 4 nations you live in , whether it 's a city or rural community , etc. 
  but the fact that there has n't been a balanced discussion about europe has honestly been the thing that has strained people 's opinions on it the most . 
  i think a referendum could end up being good for the uk 's relationship with the eu . 
  this will be the first time we 'll have a big campaign about the positives of the eu and europe ; and i think that 's what makes it a bit different from the scotland referendum - with that it was the yes side that had the positive campaign , talking about the possibilities of scotland becoming a sovereign state , the nation building and such . 
  but the uk 's position within the eu is entirely different , and the extent that the eu ` meddles ' with uk affairs can not be compared to the power the uk parliament has over scotland , so the yes campaign for the eu referendum ( assuming the leave campaign will be the yes campaign ) will have a much harder time presenting leaving the eu as a positive thing . 
  the campaign being run mostly by ukip ( and potentially backbencher tory mps ) probably wo n't help them as much either . 
  there 's no doubt that all of the main parties in the uk will put as much effort in stating their case as possible , for now the conversation has been dominated by the negative anti-eu campaign run by ukip and the right wing papers , and i hope they all try take back the conversation and present a positive case for european integration that 'll hopefully change people 's perceptions on the eu and keep us in . 
  i hope . 
  the man is delusional , not only has he stayed on as leader , even though he 's lost his seat and even after ed miliband resigned ; he recently said that he could still become scotland 's first minister next year . 
  me too , they probably wo n't get the seat baring some miracle , but hopefully it 'll up their percentage points here and give them some confidence for the assembly elections next year . 
  speak : english that 's it :( would like to learn : welsh ( missed out on most of the welsh lessons when i was younger ) - am actually thinking of maybe taking up some weekly lessons at my university next year . 
  german french maybe one of the nordic languages ? 
  i 've always loved the way norwegian sounds . 
  if you 're interested , [ here 's what that one would look like if it was updated to include all the newer eu member states ] ( http://i.imgur.com/itqpima.png ), 
  plus the fact that [ ukip 's growth has pretty much completely stalled , and are slowly bleeding away their share of the vote ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/poll-tracker ) since the start of the year . 
  edit : and i doubt we will even have the referendum anyway , labour said they probably wo n't do one and chances are they 'll end up winning the election , and if they manage it though the backing of the snp then a referendum would probably be even more unlikely . 
  for some people here that stuff you 've mentioned makes saying `` is it in england '' even worse . 
  christ , that 's bringing back some memories of terrible 2000 's [ bbc bitesize ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitesize ) videos played on the class projector . 
  ( when we were n't watching some [ look around you-esque ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4crcjumwsm ) documentary film on a 20 year old vhs tape , of course ), 
  i believe it 's mostly just england , which has suffered from quite a few droughts over the years . 
  there was a suggestion a few years ago that [ wales should start selling it 's water `` like oil '' to southern england ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-17656317 ) , funny enough . 
  maybe it should be stickied only after a day or so so it does n't drop from the front page , rather then stickying it as soon as it 's created . 
  * [ conwy castle ] ( http://img.mota.ru/upload/wallpapers/source/2011/07/06/13/01/26370/mota_ru_1070606.jpg ) , with some pretty complete [ town walls ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conwy_town_walls ) surrounding it . 
  * [ caernarfon castle ] ( http://www.britainexpress.com/zen/albums/potd/caernarfon-7894.jpg ) , which much like conwy 's also has some quite well preserved town walls . 
  * [ harlech castle ] ( http://www.harlech.com/visitwales/harlech.jpg ) * [ castell coch ] ( https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3065/2936500305_85cf9bbf97_b.jpg ) , could be argued that 's it 's not really a * true * castle , the whole thing is fantasy architecture built for the rich industrialist/marquess of bute , john crichton-stuart , and [ the interior is definitely not on the modest side . 
  ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8465/8140875387_55aa23d1fa_h.jpg ), 
  the french poll says `` n/a '' rather then a number for the do n't know result , which i would assume means that this specific poll did n't give people the option , which obviously inflates the other two answers to make the result add up to 100 % . 
  you would have to remove the do n't knows from the uk poll to properly compare them . 
  [ the welsh assembly has a similar layout ] ( http://i2.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article6236341.ece/alternates/s615/4024099jpg.jpg ) , though the first minister and his cabinet sit on the inside semi circle ( he 's the one standing up in the middle ) facing the presiding officer ( the row at the back with the ceremonial mace ) . 
  his party usually sits on the rows behind him . 
  ah right , in that sense of course . 
  also i was on mobile so i did n't see your flair , heh . 
  the problem is whether those cross border agreements can continue if the uk leaves , if they ca n't then the northern irish border would turn into a eu hard border . 
  those agreements were created while both countries were in the eu , with the assumption that they would continue to be in the eu , so things might be very complicated .
