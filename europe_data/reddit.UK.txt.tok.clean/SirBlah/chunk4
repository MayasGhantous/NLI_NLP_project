   wales separating from ~ ~ england ~ ~ the uk wales is already separate from england , as much as scotland and northern ireland is ( mostly ) . 
  the loss of the common travel area would be absolutely disastrous to the stability of northern ireland and the peace that has been achieved over the last decade and so . 
  hopefully whatever happens some form of free travel between the two ireland 's can be agreed , somehow . 
   the entire government stopped talking to each other , shut down and rumours of those in charge being arrested . 
  that happens basically every couple of years . 
  ( other then perhaps the arrested rumours , maybe ) . 
  the fact that the government * by law * has to consist of two completely opposing sides that have to find a way of working with each other makes it * ridiculously * fickle . 
  even simple disagreements can lead to the whole thing locking up for a while . 
  it 's like if the uk government consisted of a mandatory coalition between the conservatives and labour , just imagine how unstable that would be . 
  now imagine that the two parties hate each other ten times more . 
  this was partly due to the fact that in the 60 's and 70 's the uk government was too busy [ dismantling all non-car related infrastructure . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beeching_cuts ) because needs railways when we have motorways ? 
  [ in the 80 's , this was a legitimate proposal for the rail system . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/beeching2_clear.svg ) any line not on that map would be dismantled ( completely fucking over big chunks of scotland and nearly all of wales ) . 
  thankfully it did n't happen . 
  so yeah , for the last half of the 20th century our leaders really did n't give a shit , it was only in the 90 's did they start thinking `` hang on , we should probably have a functioning rail system after all '' . 
  for maps at least , the whole wales being grouped with england thing comes mainly from the fact that the office of national statistics ( the people who do the census and stuff ) has jurisdiction in both england and wales , while scotland and n. ireland do their own censuses with their own ons-equivalent department . 
  so generally whenever you see a map that has both england and wales on it but not scotland and n. ireland , they 're the one 's that created it . 
  they very rarely release maps where england and wales are treated as two separate places . 
  as for the reason why - well both england and wales share both a legal jurisdiction and a court system.this made sense back when all law in wales ( and scotland ) was made by the uk government , but now wales has it 's own law making institution , it does n't really make a whole look of sense when you think about it . 
  it 's likely that wales and england are the only two places in the world that have their own separate law making institutions , but only a single legal jurisdiction . 
  recently it 's become a bit of a hotly debated topic in the assembly as wales not having it 's own jurisdiction limits the amount of powers the assembly can have and what it can do , because if the law deviates too much in wales compared to england ( it 's already sort of has ) , then the single legal jurisdiction pretty much wo n't work any more . 
  the 3 left wing parties ( labour , plaid , lib dems ) in the assembly want it to be separated , but the conservatives ( who are ultimately the guys who decide it at a westminster level ) are n't quite as keen unfortunately . 
  [ wales ' is n't * too * bad from the ground i guess . 
  ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8143/7294423298_0434264684_b.jpg ) it would have been nice if they had gone with one of the other proposed options like using the [ coal exchange building ] ( http://i3.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article8413844.ece/alternates/s615/js47772775.jpg ) , or even just extending the [ pierhead building ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7354/11405973076_b4a2aae127_b.jpg ) that 's [ right next to it ] ( http://imgc.allpostersimages.com/images/p-473-488-90/64/6411/uoi9100z/posters/billy-stock-the-senedd-welsh-national-assembly-building-and-pier-head-building-cardiff-bay-cardiff-south-w.jpg ) and using that as the main parliament building . 
  ( the government still owns that , but they mainly use it for events and talks i believe . ), 
  also , the coal exchange has [ this absolutely badass clock ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/the_clock%2c_coal_exchange%2c_cardiff.jpg ) in the main hall . 
  [ page 94 of `` an atlas of economic geography '' ] ( https://archive.org/stream/atlasofeconomicg00bart#page/n93/mode/2up ) , from the internet archive . 
  quite a lot of other interesting maps in there as well ( along with a couple of rather questionable ones about race ... ), 
  it 's a good example of a building being designed from the inside out , with little thought of how it looks outside . 
  [ good luck finding your way around though .

  i do n't believe it 's really an issue with modern day lcd screens ( which i guess is why screensavers have gone out of fashion nowadays ) but yeah , a decade ago not only would it be a boring screensaver , it would be a * dangerous * one too . 
  you might as well not have any screensaver at all , since it certainly wo n't save your screen . 
  * wallpaper a single static image would n't make for a very exciting screensaver . 
  the government , of course . 
  the obvious solution is to replace the polish government with the fire department . 
  the term `` football '' simply refers to a category of sports with a related origin . 
  association football ( soccer/football etc ) is the most popular one , but there 's also rugby football ( rugby union and rugby league , etc ) and gaelic football ( mostly played in ireland ) . 
  in that sense american football is just as much a type of football as soccer and rugby are ; the idea that `` football '' only refers to association football is a relatively recent concept . 
  this is a problem due to westminister 's electoral system and face-to-face , us-vs-them , extremely partisan style of politics it fosters . 
  but it does n't have to be like that . 
  even within the devolved parliaments , things tend to be less like that ( sometimes at least ) . 
  things like a far bigger focus on committees ( allowing them to introduce bills themselves , rather then just the government for example ) , semi-circular and roundtable style seating , speaking into mics rather then shouting , a proportional voting system with a number of large parties , a far bigger focus on public petitions , and the smaller size of the institution itself - helps to keep things a bit more calmer , most of the time at least . 
  i would agree though , there are massive problems with westminster and the whole system needs massive reforms if the uk wants to get back to a more sustainable state in the future . 
  transitioning to a form of federalism with regional parliaments in england , allowing a big chunk of the mps to be cut and for the commons to act more like a senate , and implementing some of the things mentioned that the devolved institutions have , would definitely make a bit of a difference . 
  but i do n't see this happening any time soon , unfortunately . 
  it would be the best form of government * if you and everyone in the country agreed with every single thing they did , * and everyone had the same opinion on everything . 
  since a country is made up of more then one person , and everyone has a different opinion , this would be impossible . 
  democracy exists because people have different opinions . 
  they do n't even have a rail network . 
  [ could be a milton keynes resident . 
  ] ( http://www3.open.ac.uk/contact//maps/wh-local.gif ), 
  do n't want to promote regional identities now , next thing you know they 'll have the nerve to ask for their own parliament . 
  [ plus there 's a lot of towns and villages nowadays that do n't have any railway near by at all ] ( http://www.robertpriddy.com/curios/beeching_railway_plan.jpg ) , especially in wales , scotland , northern ireland , and western and northern england which were hardest hit by the beeching cuts, 
  political bullshit from both sides is pretty terrible . 
  nazi germany and stalinist russia were n't great places to live . 
  something i 've never really understood with web ads : if they can be blocked by the client by simply blocking the request to the ad domain , why not generate the ads server side ? 
  as in , the ads are inserted into the page by the server , and simply become part of the the web page . 
  there would n't really be any way an ad blocker would be able to distinguish a advert and the page 's content itself if they did that , surely ? 
  there 's something quite dystopian about the reality of buildings like these however . 
  not as nice as the [ council of europe 's chamber . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ygke5hm.jpg ) perhaps they should swap buildings . 
  our shambolically run government , skeleton crew civil service , and the dozen or so trade negotiators we have in total will surely be able to get a ton of great deals in the two years the uk has until it 's unceremoniously kicked out of the eu , after which the entire economy , along with the nostalgic dreams of britain as a world power , slowly collapse . 
  and then scotland decides to leave beginning a slow motion dissolution of the uk itself from within . 
  but at least whatever remains of it will be able to trade freely with australia , currently an entire 1.2 % of trade on total . 
  strange that the threat has increased right around the time the vote for trident renewal is happening . 
  you have a different definition of `` entertaining times '' then me . 
  these are however , [ `` interesting times '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_you_live_in_interesting_times ) ... 
  i mean even nicola sturgeon is hoping that an independent scotland within the eu would be able to get some of that london pie . 
  [ apparently the treasury has been trying to get london banks to keep their mouths shut and attempt to spin this whole brexit thing as a positive move ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4sqrb5/anger_at_jpmorgans_unhelpful_brexit_warnings/d5bewos ) - things are going bad . 
  really , really , bad . 
  oh yeah , all those alleged trade deals the dozen or so trade negotiators in the uk government will be able to sign in just two years . 
  our government is so completely inexperienced with making trade deals , so ridiculously understaffed , [ they 've had to ask a bunch of * private companies * to help them instead . 
  ] ( https://next.ft.com/content/7ccfd858-41e0-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d ) those wonderful trade deals are about as much of a fantasy as the extra 350 million we 'll supposedly be spending on the nhs any day now . 
  the fact that scotland would be country in the eu that speaks english and it 's capital is only about 4 or so hours away by train from london , could potentially make it a pretty good place to do business if they played their cards right . 
  the queen can technically go to war if she wanted , but * practically * her power is non-existent , and when used only follows strict protocol - [ to the point where the phrase `` activate the queen '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcufite-p4o ) became a bit of a meme when there was a hung parliament ( no party had a majority ) during 2010 . 
  [ sweden is technically required to join the euro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_and_the_euro ) , but since joining the eu they have made no plans to switch over unless a referendum on the matter succeeds . 
  so while it is technically mandatory there is a precedent for it being more of a voluntary thing - at least presumably so long as the country pledges to eventually hold a referendum on the matter . 
  i would imagine the most probably course of action for an independent scotland would be to create their own scottish pound which would be pegged to either the pound or the euro , depending on which one looks more desirable by that time . 
  the question of joining the eurozone would probably be left for another time . 
  as for the other opt-outs , the only other major one i imagine scotland would wish to keep would be the opt-out with the schengen area - considering that ireland also has that same opt-out with that due to them sharing a land border with the uk , so too would scotland i would imagine . 
  i ca n't imagine there would be a massive amount of opposition to that since scotland is in a pretty similar geographical situation as ireland anyway . 
  `` never worked a day in his life . '', 
   he worked in the ngo sector specialising in peace-building , arms control and democracy in the caucasus and the balkans regions . 
  he worked with ngo links in tbilisi focusing on the conflicts surrounding the breakaway entities in the south caucasus such as south ossetia , abkhazia and nagorno-karabakh . 
  he also worked for saferworld on arms control , peace-building and democratisation in the former soviet union and balkans . 
  i 'm guessing blue-collar jobs only count as proper work then ? 
  what sort of job do you have ? 
  and their home , a shelter , their health , their families health , a functional society , a lack of war , disease , absolute poverty , malnourishment , safe drinking water ... 
  i understand what you mean by this being a protest vote , and i would agree to a certain extent , but to suggest that these people have `` nothing left to loose '' is a bit disingenuous - not that we should judge our standards of living with that of the poorest developing countries , but it is definitely possible for things to become visibly worse for them . 
  very , very visibly worse . 
  no [ under construction signs ] ( http://www.textfiles.com/underconstruction ) either . 
  i 'm still waiting for [ larry the no . 
  10 cat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larry_ ( cat \\ ) ) to finally take control as the right and proper leader of the uk . 
  i mean , at the very least if not for the war his legacy would have been things like the northern ireland peace agreement , devolution to scotland and wales and other things such as the national minimum wage . 
  not bad . 
  he got off with a great start in the late 90 's , but the whole thing just collapsed as soon has he went to war a few years later . 
  other then the fact that it was the poor as well as the middle class , nearly entirely white communities that voted * leave * , and the generally more middle class , less-white urban communities that voted to * stay * . 
  it was in fact the areas with high levels of immigration such as london and other cities that voted mostly to stay .
