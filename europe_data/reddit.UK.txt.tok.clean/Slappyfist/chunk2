  westminster constantly sold it as ironclad and substantial changes of powers until the uk supreme court ruled that is has no weight in law . 
  it 's not that people thought it was more than it was , its that it 's completely useless . 
  this is mostly about the hardcore brexiters . 
  scotland being part of the uk is part of their national identity but what their national identity is is skewed somewhat . 
  brexit was largely an english nationalist movement but english identity is mixed with their british identity , they are largely one and the same , so scotland remaining is important to maintaining their english nationalism . 
  this is why in one breathe they will disparage the scots but with the next they will fight for them to stay part of britain . 
  from the stv poll today it 's 17 % of yes voters that would n't want to join the eu . 
  i do n't think i 'm any different to the english and i do n't think i have heard anyone really express that feeling that was n't a complete idiot . 
  it 's more about the uk government seemingly not working in the interests of scotland and having no way to impact that by voting . 
  there was a residency requirement , it was 2 years . 
  eu nationals were given a vote because it was about allowing those that were residents of scotland a chance to vote . 
  your friends from uni must have lived here for at least 2 years and whilst giving such transitionary group of people a vote can have its problems its a small amount of people to make the referendum fair to many others . 
  this is why i found it so strange that the unionist side was so pleased about the result last time . 
  sure yes did n't win but 44 % people voted for it from a 28 % starting point . 
  the unionist side lost that referendum hard , like really hard . 
  the only demographics that saved them was the over 65 's and , to a lesser extent and ironically enough now , eu nationals . 
  the no side also originally called themselves project fear until the yes side started using it against them . 
  it was n't a term coined purely to disparage the other side , they openly went out to spread their project fear . 
  you are correct . 
  if scotland ever goes for independence it will not have been won by the snp but lost by the actions of westminster . 
  the most ridiculous part of all of this is that scottish independence would currently be a complete non issue if david cameron had allowed an option for devo-max in the last referendum . 
  it would have won easily and we would be in a different constitutional arrangement , but due to david camerons hubris he felt he could win the referendum easily . 
  instead of winning it easily what he actually achieved was forcing large portions of the scottish electorate who would n't naturally be separatists into becoming dedicated independence voters . 
  and once they have made that choice it is very difficult to win them back . 
   in the uk , scottish mps are allowed to vote on matters that only affect england . 
  english mps can not do the same for scotland . 
  yes this is the west lothian question , a problem incidentally that ** only ** the snp have even tried to address , and there is a very good reason why scottish mp 's vote on things that affect england . 
  scotland 's budget is calculated by giving it proportionally the same amount of money spent in england , so what happens in england directly affects the scottish population . 
  do you think it 's reasonable for the scottish electorate to have zero influence on the budget of the scottish government ? 
  yeah , he 's saying what your differing political views are make you insurgents not that having a different view makes you an insurgent . 
  i think he is saying that the media spun the worrying poll results to create a narrative that would influence people to vote for the cause they were behind , not that the polling companies themselves were fabricating results . 
  yeah , this is just the beginning of the medias campaign against indy ref 2 . 
  all and sundry shall somehow negatively relate to scottish independence , because surely it could n't be brexit 's fault as that would just be silly . 
  i 'm not saying fidel castro did no bad things or communism is a particularly good system of government but compared to pre-revolution cuba the country was immeasurably better for non-batista cubans in a number of ways . 
  living standards went up , a national health service which is competitive on the global stage was created , access to and general education levels shot up , more equitable rights for women and black cubans were instated and ( pretty desperately needed , though maybe not on communist levels ) land reforms happened . 
  pre-revolution the place was a dystopian capitalist hell hole . 
  not the capitalism we are used to in the west , it was total banana republic type capitalism . 
  all the good land was either foreign or corporation owned , actual cubans had nothing . 
  modern cuba has serious issues , mostly created by communism and the embargo by the us , but the revolution brought the country up from its knees . 
  it being a `` shithole '' is a lot better than what it was . 
  or we could just look at what ` murican cuba was like , which was a corrupt shithole that rich americans used as their play pen . 
  did they look at you ? 
  i heard they can kill you with death rays from their eyes . 
  well cuba is certainly better off than it was under us stewardship . 
  also interference from the us has n't exactly allowed latin american to flourish either . 
  well it 's already too late , nicola sturgeon went and had informal talks with guy verhofstadt and , conveniently enough , martin schulz . 
  she was only able to do so because the entire british political establishment fell into disarray immediately after the brexit result except for the snp , so nobody tried to stop her . 
  she only stopped when the french and spanish leaders indicated that she should . 
  and as a scottish person i am finding it very interesting that schulz might have a chance of becoming germany 's leader . 
  he has already shown that he is at least somewhat sympathetic to scotlands position and if he does end up being in charge of germany at the time scotland is attempting to join the eu it may make the whole process somewhat simpler . 
  if i 'm to be honest scottish independence is slightly tempting for me just so i could see what those ulster chaps would do . 
  i 'm not particularly happy about it , i would have loved a federalised uk inside the eu , but scotland is gone man . 
  maybe not in the next 5 years but in 10 or 20 ? 
  the over 65 's are the only demographic stopping scotland right now and they only vote that way because they can actually remember what it was like before the forces that pushed scotland into drifting away from the wider u.k. were around . 
  everyone else either had too little exposure to that reality or were n't even alive to know what it was . 
  unless some really , ** really ** serious constitutional changes happen in the u.k. we are out and even with those changes i give it a good chance we leave anyway . 
  and as i said i am not particularly happy about that , but it is what it is . 
  the only way it wo n't happen is if the eu completely collapses and i am not at all convinced that is going to happen any time soon . 
  i said very close and that 's very close . 
  my point was that holyrood 's voting was a very close reflection of the electoral vote , which is the exact opposite of what you were claiming . 
  what do you want , the parliament to vote * exactly * along the lines of the electoral vote ? 
  the vote for and against was 90 for and 34 against . 
  this is very close to the proportion of scottish brexit yes/no votes in the referendum . 
  you are completely wrong . 
  it was backed by unionist parties , so to paint it as a cheap publicity stunt by the snp is an outright falsehood . 
   the scottish electorate is irrelevant . 
  there is only the uk electorate . 
  this would be a fair point if there was n't an almost unanimous distinction between scotland and the rest of the uk . 
  the fact that there is such a disparity means that there is an issue going on that has to be addressed . 
  i do n't know how to properly answer your question because i do n't even understand what you are trying to say . 
  because scotland has a political movement which is trying to achieve that ? 
  that 's because when poland joined the eu the british government massively misjudged how many polish immigrants were going to move here , mostly because the uk was one of the only eu countries that did n't put limitations on their numbers . 
  it was along the lines of being told there would be tens of thousands but in reality half a million came . 
  initially this upset a lot of people but as it turns out polish people actually integrate into the uk 's society particularly well , we have very similar social foibles as each other . 
  nowadays it 's less about `` we 're being invaded by the polish '' , i have n't seen , read or heard anyone saying something like that for a very long time , and more along the lines of `` remember how many more polish people came than expected , what happens when it 's from somewhere that does n't fit in !!!! '', 
  i 'm not a scottish nationalist . 
  i did n't use the one with ed miliband in salmond 's pocket because that one is debatable but the pickpocketing one is clearly playing up to the scottish scrounger stereotype . 
  to suggest otherwise is just disingenuous . 
  apparently being sceptical of brexit and trying to represent how the scottish electorate voted is having no honour , decency or dignity . 
  it 's not like trying to be in a union with people with attitudes like this is becoming increasingly difficult or anything . 
  the conservatives ? 
  like they did to win the last general election ? 
  remember all those posters of alex salmond pickpocketing people with the caption `` do n't let the snp steal your money '' ? 
  i ca n't understand this idea that has somehow entered the wider uk public psyche that ~ 45 % pro independence is somehow `` low '' . 
  i ca n't remember the actual number but at the start of the last referendum support for independence was ~ 30 % . 
  it has barely dropped since the referendum result and nothing to do with brexit has actually happened yet . 
  support is still at troublingly high numbers for unionists and i would n't be surprised for the numbers to change once anything to do with brexit has actually started happening or when it starts economically affecting us . 
  i 'm glad the numbers have n't changed much , voting for you countries future on purely emotional grounds is outright idiocy , so i 'm happy the wider scottish public are waiting until some actual information comes about so an informed decision can be made . 
  this is going to sound a little heartless but fuck em honestly . 
  large portions of agriculture industry is inherited and the owners have been running unsustainable businesses by being propped up by eu subsidies . 
  these very same people then largely vote conservative but are never targeted by the conservatives policies , everyone else has to pay for their voting patterns . 
  i see it more as just deserts , it 's beyond high time they got some of the laissez-faire capitalism treatment everyone else in the country has to endure . 
  if they think completely unrestricted free market capitalism is the way to run every facet of society then they can start putting their money where their mouth is . 
  it 's less about number of seats or population size and more to do with relative economic strength . 
  the countries with the strongest economies have sort of been put into a position where they have to function like a pseudo coalition federal government . 
  the problem with this is that the electorate of the countries with weaker economies have no real say in the makeup of this `` federal government '' . 
  let me put it this way , greece electing siryza caused some problems but did n't massively affect other eu countries but if germany elected a party like siryza it would cause large problems for the entire eu . 
  if california ( one of the strongest states economically ) elected a party like siryza it would cause some problems but if the us elected siryza it would cause large problems for all the states . 
  before i say this , and just to clarify , i voted remain . 
  the flaws of the eu come from the gradualist approach to federalization .
