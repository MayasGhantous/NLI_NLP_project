if this is discriminator information gathering , then surely most forms of polling would be illegal ? 
  but it still reports the important news and ignores the tedium of daily politics and gossip . 
  that 's why i really appreciate it . 
  you ca n't have a perfect newspaper ( i do n't think all of your criticism is fair , though ) but private eye is pretty good , even without comparing it to the rest of the tripe out there . 
  forget to mention : expost from / r/france, 
  why would they be illegal to gather ? 
  additionally , you ca n't be a second , third , ect , muslim . 
  you either are one , or you 're not . 
  it 's a religion , not a nationality . 
  depends what you read . 
  tabloids are shit . 
  broadsheets leave a lot to be desired , but at least there 's some good stuff in them . 
  periodicals are fantastic though . 
  the economist and private eye are fantastic and deserve more good press , in my opinion . 
  not that they 'll get any from the press . 
  giving away money = / = influence or at least not the kind of influence borroso is talking about . 
  within the european union , we have the change to make trade deals with the united states on our own terms , rather than exclusively on theirs . 
  within the european union we can keep russia at bay , outside eu borders . 
  china 's president makes trips to brussels to meet with its presidents . 
  do you think he would do that for a tiny island nation hedged hedged between the gigantic eu bloc and the enormous american one . 
  a nation , with whom he could freeze relations with simply for holding talks with the dalai lama ? 
  he would n't freeze talks with the european union . 
  alone , the uk could pledge a few hundred million to starving depleted african countries who 'll ignore us anyway . 
  it 's not exactly the sort of thing which gave us a seat at the un security council . 
  we got that seat for * creating * international organisations , and being on the side of history which is creating new world orders . 
  we did n't get that seat because we said `` no thanks '' to the un and we wo n't get a bargaining seat in world affairs if we say `` no thanks '' to the eu either . 
  how would that story even work ? 
  franklin dellen roosevelt ( i 'm assuming it ca n't be the other roosevelt who was presisident 20 years previously ) [ used a wheelchair . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franklin_d._roosevelt's_paralytic_illness ), 
   nationalism and sectarianism is not water under the bridge , its still as prevalent in ireland today as it was 50 years ago which is precisely why we should n't thank people for it . 
  it 's paying lip-service to these past events as if they still matter is what further sectarianism and nationalism and the pointless violence along with it . 
  thanking such an abstract concept as a nation just furthers the problem . 
  nations are just collections of people . 
  nothing more . 
  given the inhabitants of a modern nation praise for something those inhabitants did n't do is just as pointless and almost as dangerous as hating them for something their `` nation '' did in the past , that they rightly have no reason to be blamed for . 
  for instance , germans do n't deserve to be hated for what their ancestors did to the jews . 
  we need to remember that it happened because it was atrocious and should never be repeated , but modern germans should hold no guilt for it . 
  just like they should receive no thanks for irish independence . 
  unfortunately being head of your party usually forces the leader into this humourless , boring , `` statesman like '' demeanour . 
  hague is a very characterful politician , and one of the only tories i have the vaguest feelings of positivity towards , but not because of his years has conservative leader . 
  neil kinnock is another good example . 
  he was leader of the labour party for most of thatcher 's years , and was very humourful and characterful . 
  but lost it all when he was labour leader , because his aids told him he needed to be `` statesman '' like . 
  expost / r/economics source : https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileid=5521f296-d460-2b88-081889db12817e02, 
  there 's [ this hilarious speech by former foreign secretary william hague ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz26smdzxhe ) about when former british prime minister tony blair was trying to become president of the european commission, 
  this is gon na sound potentially insensitive given i have the union flag next to my name , but please just pretend i have a different one for the moment , like sweden or spain . 
  surely this is all water under the bridge now ? 
  i know it 's less than a hundred years ago , which is nothing in european history , but irish independence is now , mostly , too far in the past for anybody to remember . 
  what 's more , * remembering it * has led to huge rounds of sectarian violence across the british [ celtic ] isles . 
  the whole point of the european project and the european union is to band together and forget our thousands of years of wars , even if the score has n't quite been settled . 
  if that 's true for enemies , it should be true for ` friends ' too . 
  it 's just the reverse side of the same coin that we use for remembering the trivialities of the past . 
  the only things we should learn from the past is what to do and what to not do in the future . 
  no thanks or anger deserves to be given to anybody else for something their now dead great-grand parents may , or may not , have had something to do with . 
  it 's all water under the bridge which will only lead to pointless nationalism and sectarian violence . 
  we 've all had enough of that . 
  and the gay-homosexes !, 
  is no need for such things in glorious , heterosexual , besterosexual mother russia !, 
  because i came here for interesting discussion . 
  not to hold your hand, 
  i like poland too . 
  am i doing it right ? 
  ignoring the fact that the governed of texas is nowhere near as interesting ( or important ) as berluaconi , we 're not in / r/america and if we were , i would n't ask who the governed of texas was just like people should n't come into / r/europe and ask who one of the most prominent characters on the european stage is . 
  it 's like going to / r/unitedkingdom and saying `` i 'm not from around here . 
  who 's the queen ? '', 
  it just irks all the normal inhabitants who do n't want their sub to become a tourist information centre, 
  most netizens have n't heard of mitterand . 
  but then it has been quite some time since he was president of france . 
  i think those that were following the news whilst he was in office should know who he is , just like they should know who david cameron , putin and hollande are, 
  you must be new here, 
  the only newspaper i 've managed to find which is anything like a pan-european newspapers is infuriatingly the international new york times or the economist ( or at least the european sections of both ) . 
   mock the week i 'd be hard pressed to call that a current events panel show . 
  sure it has a couple of moments where they show you a picture of something related to a current event ^ [ ^ ( like a picture of the queen , or a footballer saying something racist , or prince harry doing something stupid , because non of these things happen very often and allow them to have pre-prepared lines ) ^ ] but the show is mostly just canned laughter and comedians incorporating their normal stand up routines for a panel show . 
  i 'm doing spanish evening classes at the moment . 
  i ca n't help but feel that at least half the people on the course are going to be bitterly disappointed when they go on their holiday to ibiza or barcelona and find that the only language people will speak without immense bitterness is catalan or sometimes english . 
  a lot of them really do n't seem to have any idea about the country they holiday in every year . 
  you 're not expected to like you are in some other places , but i 'm sure the staff wo n't mind if you tip them . 
  also , if you get served food , i 'd tip them . 
  but only a little bit . 
  the way you said it made it seem like * every * nederlandisches province had the same name as its capital , rather than just groeningen . 
   yes , but have you ever seen pro-gun ownership comments highly upvoted here ? 
  they are in the mainstream subreddits . 
  issues that would summon an american horde never seem to summon that horde . 
  well that 's because most subs have clear american majorities , where as this one has a clear european majority and on those specific issues europeans tend to be pretty much in agreement that the american way is wrong , which makes it hard to appreciate ( even a well written ) argument for those points of view . 
  i do think there is a little bit of prejudice towards the american flags , but normally if you 're not saying anything particularly america related , you 'll be up * or * downvoted like everyone else . 
  it 's only when you get ` americans , come over here , shouting about healthcare ' that the typical / r/europe user base gets a little riled and protective of one of the only english-speaking bastions of non-americanism on the internet . 
  * they still happen every sunday and are stickied for a few days , 
   this place is still barely better than / r/worldnews [ 1 ] . 
  that 's a bit harsh . 
  there 's certainly less then amiable elements to the sub , but do n't judge / r/europe exclusively on it 's most shitty and occasional aspect . 
  the reason / r/worldnews is shit is because it 's as bad as / r/europe on it 's worst day * all the time * and * usually worse * . 
  there 's a lot of community discussion and intellectual discussion which is some of the best on reddit , in my opinion . 
  that stuff is n't going on 24/7 but it 's still frequent and worth remembering when parallels with / r/worldnews are being ( unfairly ) drawn . 
   the mods inevitably become distant and self-important i 've got a ban-hammer over here with your name on !, 
  just say the word !, 
  / s :p but in reality , we 're just as detached and self-centred as we always were !, 
  it happens surprisingly often . 
  for instance , every single european treaty ( of which there are several ) have been unanimous , as has the appointment of every single president of the european commission by the council of the eu apart from the most recent ( juncker ) which had 26 agreed , with only the uk and hungary vetoing , and the uk 's veto was largely symbolic [ cameron wants to look like he 's actually trying to get shit done on the eu stage , even though he 's neither getting shit done nor trying ] . 
  90 % of the stuff the conservative press [ ie entire british press , minus three newspapers ] moans on about is either a lie [ or `` euromyth '' ] such as the brussels bendy banana [ sometimes bendy cucumber because the press ca n't decide which lie is true ] which bans banana which are too curvy ( which is n't true because they are n't banned , they just have to be put into a different quality category , and the wto et al forced us to do that ages before the eu did ) , or that acrobats will have to wear hard-hats like builders do , [ or that sausages/bangers need to be renamed `` high fat , emulsified offal tubes '' because they do n't contain enough actual meat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biyp1ibydzi ) [ of which only the second part of that myth is true ] . 
  there 's so many euromyths that several meps and [ even the european commission itself ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/category/euromyths/ ) have had to set up websites to target euromyths in a vague attempt to stamp out misinformation .
