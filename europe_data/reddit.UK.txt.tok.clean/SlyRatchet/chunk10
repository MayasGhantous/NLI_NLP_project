  the low countries would be a lot higher on that list , if only people knew more about them . 
  i do n't know where you 've gotten that from . 
  if you look here http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules rule three is this  infographics which are poorly sourced will be removed . 
  the submitter must provide the source in the comments , including a brief explanation if necessary , soon after making the submission . 
  the ony source which was provided was a link to / r/humanporn with some reddit user saying that he has met this guy . 
  that is nowhere near a good enough source . 
  well firstly , nobody is stopping americans from coming here and saying things . 
  that is what i meant by welcome . 
  maybe you 're definition of welcome is different and it requires that people actively invite them to come here , but personally i do n't think that is necessary . 
  they 're allowed to come here and voice their opinions , and the current user base is allowed to completely ignore that opinion and even criticise it if they see fit , which it often is given the hugely aggrivating american-centric way in which they will deliver such opinions '' *** as an american ... *** '' '' *** europe needs to buck up the fucking slack , stop lounging around with ridiculous social welfare programmes and top relying on america to pay for their defence ! *** '' . 
  those are both legitimate opinions , but i do not actively advocate people coming to this subreddit who are going to speak so abrasively , even if i think they are welcome to . 
  this is / r/europe and not / r/everyotherbloodysubreddit . 
  if people want to go and shout about an american perspective on european affairs , personally i would rather they did so elsewhere because there are literally hundreds of places on reddit for them to do that , where as the number of subreddits where people can come and discuss european things with other europeans away from the '' * america this * '' '' * america that * '' is slim . 
  it 's those visa bans . 
  does n't literally ca n't travel unless one of his close friends comes to hold his hand and most of those guys are n't allowed to travel in the eu anymore . 
  suck it russia !, 
  all opinions are welcome . 
  i 'm not gon na tell an american they have no reason to talk here , but at the same time i , personally , am not going to value it as much because i have been so over exposed to it on the entire rest of the site and in multiple forms of media . 
  this post has been removed . 
  amongst other reasons , detroit related stuff is n't really in this subs remit , though i maybe / r/detroit or / r/americanproblems would be interested , 
  a large reason subreddits like this exist is to get away from the hugely american-centric content on the rest of reddit and enjoy some content which actually matters to the region of the world i live in . 
  i 'd really rather not have a bunch of americans barging in and saying ` this is what i think , as an american ^ ^ tm ', 
  dara is northern irish !, 
  really going into those defenceless abyssinians :(, 
  shhhh , i 'm trying to throw them a bone here !, 
  but then sweden is only really competing against russia in that category . . 
  somalialand is doing ... better than the rest of somalia ? 
  so you 've got that going for you . 
  which is nice . 
  in [ communist ] russia , everything is equal , including love, 
   ** '' ** not a colony ** '' ** ftfy maybe it 's a willing colony , that 's definitely what was and what it still is today . 
   sheffield was the part of the uk that was the predominant area where they settled and still has a lot of links . 
  wot ? 
  lived in sheffield my entire life and i had no idea about this . 
  i wish our fucking art galleries and museums would focus on stuff like this , rather just `` look . 
  we used to make steel . 
  we were pretty good at it . 
  look at these knives and forks which were made in sheffield '' * nobody cares * but people would care about this . 
  i might write to my local council . 
  they 've come so far , and overcome such adversity !, 
  i think one day they might be taken seriously as a country, 
  you mean , our approach to business and our legal system ? 
  in this case , i agree  ` hong kong ' is great at those things , especially compared to all its neighbours in the region , and most of the world , to be fair . 
  gibraltar 's a current colony , not an ex-colony !, 
  personally i 'd put hong kong a lot closer to the top , mostly because they 're so pro-democracy and liberal and are working so hard to retain that , despite being part of such an oppressive country . 
  also , their # $ # $ # $ is a good measure of success . 
  and i like the way you put new zealand at the top , to make them feel special . 
  canada , australia and new zealand all kind of merge into one when i consider their role and their history in the empire and * really * i find it very hard to discriminate between them , apart from recently with abbot in australia . 
  but putting new zealand at the top of those three is nice . 
  they 're finally top of something this way , 
   and how do you feel about the fact that you can only vote for candidates from your own country ? 
  i was under the impression that the exact opposite was true . 
  i 've heard about berlusconi postulating on standing for a european parliament seat in outside of italy somewhere , and i know there is a british guy who stands as a candidate in estonia or one of the baltic countries . 
  or maybe if we have to break europe down into regions consisting of only two countries in several instances , then we should just refer to each country individually and drop the whole idea of breaking europe into these north , south , east , west , central , south east , south west , and god knows how many other categorisations . 
  the article actually makes a lot of sense if you look at it ideologically . 
  the telegraphy and assumedly the writer of this article are extremely conservative which is why the paper is often called the torygraph ( tories being an informal name for the conservative party ) . 
  the central tenant of conservative ideology is that things can derive value and meaning exclusively from their being old . 
  tied into this , conservatives also believe rationally working out a more favourable situation than the current one is , at best , difficult and best avoided . 
  now , if you keep that in mind , an article basically saying `` people died for the uk , so we should keep it '' makes more sense than it would at first glance . 
  that 's not to say that it is n't stupid , but rather that it is less stupid than it would first seem . 
  wan na give us some back ground about who might win , and what that will mean ? 
  oh my golly gosh you 're right . 
  i meant to say the thick of it , but i just imagined one of the scenes from the show and immediately thought `` mad men '' . 
  the title just fits too well ... 
  i quite liked some of the british political dramas , like mad men , house of cards ( original british version ) and also the various attenborough stuff and qi . 
  but * after that * i did get bored . 
  i wish they had trawled back further to get some of the british classics , like yes minister and and maybe black adder . 
  or at least put some of the other good american stuff on there . 
  where 's the west wing and star trek voyager :( so , it 's good , but it 's so good that i almost * expect * it to be good , and then i am severely disappointed by all the stuff it does n't have . 
  kind of bittersweet . 
    it is significantly worse in ailing eurozone economies  no . 
  [ yes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unemployment_in_spain ) and [ yes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_greece ) . 
   on a sidenote : if you do n't even took macro 101 you probably should n't attacking the eus policies . 
  chances are you understand so little that you can not pass judgement . 
   i 'm going to stop here because not only is it incorrect ( and even if it was correct it would be horribly oversimplified ) , it also has nothing to do with the topic . 
   unless of course you attempt to say that the people of czech have no clue about the euro and the eu and that is their reasoning for not wanting to have it . 
  so let me get this straight , you 're going to do nothing to explain why i am wrong apart from provide * one * wikipedia link to * one * instance where a country did n't deflate its own currency , despite the hundreds of instances where countries did and then criticise me for being an idiot , whilst you yourself do nothing apart from rant and be generally quite an insulting little sod and provide effectively no rebuttal to any of the three arguments i presented to you . 
  and you 're calling * me * the idiot ? 
   you mean the sovereign debt crisis everybody has ? 
  how come the eu gets blamed for that one ? 
  it is significantly worse in ailing eurozone economies due to the shared currency . 
  normally countries in financial trouble would just print more money and make the relative value of their debt obligations become smaller ( inflate away their debt ) . 
  so southern european economies are in free fall , and dependent on bailout money which they are being given in exchange for austerity , and it is turning out that austerity was potentially the wrong method ( see , imf reports , who initially advocated austerity ) . 
  it was all very poorly handled and no solution has yet been reached . 
  even has the huge europhile i am , i ca n't say that the eurocrisis was anything other than poorly handled . 
  it was n't as badly handled as some people thing , but it was still poorly handled . 
   and what exactly is bad ( aside from africa , but we are talking about czech republic here ) about agricultral policy because the purpose of the cap was to ensure european food independence which it has n't achieved , and instead of the money going to small scale , innovative farmers , it has gone to large scale , multinational conglomerates like nestl\u00e9 , and also the british royal family . 
  so it 's effectively damaging to economic enterprise and continues to fail hopelessly at achieving its goals . 
  seems pretty poor to me . 
   and what the fuck does that have to do with the euro it does n't . 
  but it is an example of poor management ( note : i did not say ` incompetence ' . 
  i am not going that far ) by the european union which would make czechs and other non-eurozone countries suspicious of the credentials of joining the euro . 
   and mass immigration ? 
  i do n't even ... one of the pillars of the eu is freedom of movement , specifically of labour . 
  this is a pillar i support , but it is viewed negatively by a lot of individuals throughout europe , in the west because migration depressed high western european wages , and in the east and south because it has led to a ` brain drain ' . 
  it is a pillar i fundamentally support , but it has led to many problems which could have been and should be offset . 
  i would also appreciate not being sworn at , but maybe that 's just me ? 
  inability to solve the sovereign dept crisis ( ostensibly ) , the common agricultural policy , and mass immigration ?

  if op is n't going to do it , we will !,
