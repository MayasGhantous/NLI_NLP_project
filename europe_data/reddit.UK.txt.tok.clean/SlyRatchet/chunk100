  however , i think certain issues could be devolved to the european level . 
  for instance , free trade regulations because of the common market, 
  yeah , a use would never be formed like the usa was . 
  it would be formed more like the uk , ie , long gradual evolution and tinkering and * extremely * complicated relationships rather than a federal ( as we know it ) relationship which is all about equal treatment of member states before the federal ( washington ) government . 
  the eu , so far , has ever so slightly different agreements with each of its member states , where as the us has exactly the same agreement with every single one of its states . 
  i see no reason why the eu would suddenly try and make its relationship with every member state exactly the same . 
  so should n't we fix it ? 
  i 'd just like to show you the video which popularised that * fake * statistic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3t95-g86ag as you can see , it 's a little bias, 
  i 'm against the use being a * means unto itself * . 
  that is , i believe that we should n't create a united states of europe for the sake of creating a united states of europe and instead create it , and integrate ourselves to solve specific issues . 
  we should n't integrate for the sake of it . 
  we should integrate because integration is a good idea . 
  i believe that a lot of things could be done better with central eu planning , but some things would also be harmed by being centrally planned . 
  for instance , education . 
  what benefit would there be to having a fully integrated eu education system ? 
  we already have an eu system for working out how much a qualification is worth compared to other eu qualifications . 
  there 's little benefit to harmonising the education system any further than that . 
  so long as a secondary or university graduate in sweden can be directly compared to a university or secondary school student in spain , why would we integrate further ? 
  on the other side of the equation , why have n't we integrate our defence forces ? 
  we already have nato , but that has numerous problems , notably that it is heavily bias towards us interests and not catered towards european interests and values . 
  those values chiefly being that we mostly do n't like spending a lot of money on defence and that we mostly do n't like intervening in foreign affairs . 
  for instance greece , france and the uk are some of the only eu countries with defence budgets exceeding two percent of gdp and france and the uk are some of the only countries to intervene in a big way outside of europe , not including afghanistan ( france , mali - uk , iraq ) . 
  for all of those who like the idea of the use for its own sake , you 're fully entitled to that opinion , but you 'll win over * a lot * more people to your cause if you talk about it in terms of the benefits , on a point by point basis , as to why integration in the eu is a good idea . 
  to people like me , the use just sounds good , but other people ( like my more rational side ) need to be convinced on a rational level , not an emotional one . 
  iirc the eu is working on banning imports as well , but that is more complicated so takes longer . 
  ok , well , for starters do you know what these are ? 
  * european commission * european parliament * european central bank ( ecb ) * ecofin * european banking authority and finally * the ssm ( single supervisory mechanism ) just give me an outline of what you know for each of these . 
  have you tried looking on [ the wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_supervisory_mechanism ) ? 
  i 'm not quite sure what you want in terms if help . 
  i 'm not about to dive deep into the inner workings of the entire financial system * and * the inner workings of the eurozone *** and *** the workings of the european union . 
  you 're going to need to explain more specifically what you want . 
  that came across really negative :( so , sometimes there are trade surpluses and sometimes there are deficits and it changes with time . 
  so the surplus we have now will eventually end , just like everything . 
  however we have a surplus now , which means we 're getting more money than we spend which is a good thing . 
  you just focused on all the negative aspects , which there really are n't that many of . 
  i 'll probably post this in / r/ukpolitics later . 
  we 've had members of the bnp and ukip in my constituency since before 2008 . 
  additionally , whilst you could argue that people are voting bnp because the big three parties suck , that does not explain why they have so many meps . 
  there are 6 meps for yorkshire and the humber constituency . 
  one 6th of people in the yorkshire and the humber do not support the bnp or ukip . 
  the meps for yorkshire and the humber are not representative of the political believes of the people who live in yorkshire and the humber . 
  if it was , then we would actually vote for them in other elections , and say that we support them in opinion polls and so on . 
  only 32 % of the electorate turned out in the last european elections . 
  one sixth of those that 32 % support the bnp , but that 32 % of people is not indicative of any wider believe in the rest of the region or the country . 
  if people knew more about european elections , candidates , ect then we would not have detritus like the bnp representing us . 
  yeah , i think a lot of views from people who believe the eu deserves the noble peace prize do n't take enough of a nuanced view on the matter . 
  personally , i do think it deserved it , but i also do n't think the alternative to an eu-federal ( ish ) state is war . 
  i think it 's the fault of the common market for there being no war in the eu for the past 60 years . 
  it 's the trade . 
  there 's also other influences in there as well , such as us all being united against a common enemy ( ussr 1950-1990 , terrorism 2001-present ) but i think that they just helped solidify our interdependence rather than create that interdependence . 
  so in practice * part * of the eu is why there 's no more war in europe . 
  it 's like giving the nobel peace prize to the department for health ( in the uk ) for creating the nhs , instead of giving it to the entire government , because the uk government as a whole was doing some pretty un-nobel peace prize deserving things at the time ( india and most of africa was part of the british empire then ) . 
  i ca n't say that the rest of the eu did n't help stop war , but then again i helped because i bought things from within the eu and consolidated our economic interdependence . 
  *** just another way of looking at the situation which is a bit more complicated than the ` no , the eu did not help stop war in europe '' and the ` the eu was the only thing that stopped war in europe '' camps . 
  quick , which way is america from here ? 
  and also what status they would get . 
  would all through be treated as national languages ? 
  would they get any special kind of representation or would english be treated as simply ` the common language ' but not given any legal protection ? 
  it 's an interesting box . 
  i 'm reasonably against independence , but if it does go that way i 'm starting to get a bit exciting thinking about all the language stuff, 
  i want to clarify here . 
  i did n't say federal . 
  i said asymmetric devolution of powers . 
  it 's different ... also  the difference is though that neither england , scottland or wales as entities are contested by another state or parts of its people such as is the case with northen ireland what difference does it make ? 
  india could suddenly declare that lester was part of india 's sovereign territory . 
  that does n't change the situation at all . 
  and it definitely does not make it so that lester can not be `` a functioning federal part of the uk or ireland '' . 
  i just really do n't get how a minority group in a certain region ( there 's a minority of indian born residence in lester ) effects whether or not that region can function as part of a bigger country . 
  there 's minority groups all over the place in all sorts of countries . 
  there 's a political movement in north belgium which wants north belgium to unite with the netherlands . 
  does this mean north belgium is unable to be `` a functioning part of '' belgium . 
  of course it can be part of belgium . 
  it has been for years . 
  i just do n't see where you 're getting this idea from . 
  yeah , the headline kind of seems like  it 's france 's national day . 
  insert anything relevant about france here . 
  this makes me think about what the national language ( s ) of a hypothetically independent scotland might be . . an interesting question, 
  well `` completely integrated '' in a governmental sense when talking about the uk is a rather confusing idea . 
  i mean , what with all the uk 's asymentrical devolution . 
  i mean scotland has a very powerful devolved parliament and england has no devolved institutions whatsoever . 
  ireland also has its own devolved assembly but it is * a lot * weaker than the scottish or welsh ones so i would say , in a governmental sense , northern ireland * is * completely integrated . 
  culturally is a slightly different question . 
  i do n't believe complete ` cultural integration ' is possible . 
  the uk is a liberal democracy and as such needs to cater to a wide range of different opinions . 
  the uk even allows political groups try and abolish the uk government completely . 
  and i like it this way . 
  there is no pure set of ideals that we all aspire to . 
  we just live along side one another with our differing political views and get a long . 
  this is the one , cultural thing , which all uk residents do need to do . 
  they must obey the law and if you break the law you must accept the consequences . 
  this is why i hate the england rioters and the people in this video so much . 
  they do n't do that . 
  they 're inciting and being violent which is wrong . 
  however , here 's the point i want to stress again as i have done in every post in this thread . 
  it 's not norther irelanders who are disrespecting the rule of law , it 's a bunch of pricks who want to start a fight . 
  they are not representative of all northern irelanders or even all loyalists . 
  they are a group into themselves and they do n't deserve the benefit of being lumped with a much more moderate group and thereby make them look less ridiculous . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** there are various groups throughout the uk who want to do various things . 
  loyalists , anarchists , and even sharia law advocates are all entitled to their beliefs but one thing they must all agree to is to not use violence to accomplish their means and they must accept the consequences of any laws they break whilst trying to accomplish their goals . 
  any * individual * who does not do that should be * personally * prosecuted .
