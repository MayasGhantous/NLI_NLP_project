  whilst there 's a heavy split in the conservative party between those who hate europe and those that do n't , those that do n't are n't necessarily very positive about the eu . 
  i mean , whilst some of the conservatives want the eu destroyed , the others do n't exactly like the eu , they just tolerate it and think it 's ok . 
  they do n't necessarily view it positively . 
  however , what david davis is saying here is * very * positive . 
  i mean , he 's even going some way to justifying pooling of sovereignty . 
  that 's the last thing i 'd expect a tory to support . 
  ok , he did n't actually say that and he did n't actually justify it , but it 's still pretty shocking . 
  the eu is sort of contra to conservative values . 
  it 's very interesting . 
  i think the interesting thing here is that david davis ( a conservative party member of government ) is saying something positive about the eu , and telling the european commission that they should do something . 
  i find that very interesting . 
  the bit about the ex microsoft guy is also kind of important , but i find the bit about david davis more so . 
  it 's not so much what they 're saying that 's important , it 's who 's saying it . 
  a man can dream !, 
  i love the idea of this plane flying along and then dropping another , smaller , aircraft out the back which then starts flying and fighting also . 
   big enough to hold a ch-47 chinook helicopter, 
  furthermore , he described northern cyprus as an `` eu territory '' which it is n't . 
  the eu has no real jurisdiction over that bit of land . 
  it 's autonomous , although it does have some , vague , cooperation with the eu . 
  it 's definitely not part of the eu and * definitely * not a territory . 
  i can see what you 're saying , but that argument is absolutely stupid and you 're really grasping for straws . 
  yes , homosexual acts are illegal for under 17 year olds in greece . 
  however , by that logic , homosexual acts are illegal in * every country on the planet * . 
  not only that , but sex is a criminal act in ( near ) every country on the planet . 
  it just does not work to say stuff like that . 
  it 's a crappy argument and you know it . 
  i 'm not going to get into the complicated debate about cyprus . 
  i just do n't have the patients for it . 
   as stated on the map and in my comment , i use `` total repeal '' to mean both decriminalised and equal age . 
  yes , but in your title you said this  the anniversary of stonewall riots finds eu a paragon of acceptance - or is it ? 
  ** greece ** and northern cyprus still ** criminalise same-sex ** activity `` greece ... still criminalise ( s ) same sex activity '' . 
  do n't you think that 's a bit sensational ? 
  i mean , if you put that on a newspaper headline and then said in the actual article `` ok , we just lied a little bit , no biggy , right ? '', 
  you 'd be fined for misleading the public and lying . 
  do n't you think it 's a gross exaggeration to say that greece criminalises homosexual acts ? 
  i mean , they do n't . 
  the ages of consent are different , but you can still commit any homosexual act you like . 
  so long as your a certain age and that age happens to be lower than the age of consent in some other eu countries . 
   `` they do things their way , and they 're reasonably content with it '' would probably have fitted better , but i was kind of running out of interesting ways to say things and fell victim to hyperbole . 
  would you say that the amendment ( post at the top of this comment ) is reasonably accurate ? 
  probably not . 
  i 've noticed a few american flags flying around over the months , but they tend to keep fairly quiet , for various reasons . 
   look at greece , look at spain . 
  is that the peace we want for europe ? 
  greek youths holding up nazi-merkel flags , for instance . 
  i hope you realise that this happens within countries , and not just between members of the eu . 
  whilst and after margaret thatcher was prime minister , many people called and still call her a fascist . 
  many people in britain call blair a war criminal . 
  many americans call bush a war criminal also . 
  it 's extremely unsurprising that greeks absolutely hate merkel . 
  it would be more surprising if they did n't hate her . 
  this is the consequence of having a joined up political system . 
  our politicians get to have influence over each other , and they get to blame each other . 
  non of these problems are specific to the eu , or even specific of bad government . 
  in england a few years back , there were massive riots all across the country . 
  a few years back , there were huge protests in london against student tuition fees and the government 's decision to raise them . 
  riots were had and things broken . 
  the same happens in greece , but because they hate some one from another country ( merkel ) we think that the eu is tearing apart europe . 
  that just does n't add up to me . 
  further more , do you know how much petty legislation is implemented by the reichstagg and how much petty legislation is passed by the bundestag and the bundesrat . 
  wow do you think petty legislation is so much the fault of the eu . 
  furthermore , should n't more petty legislation come from the eu , given that it is basically the thing that oversees the smooth running of the common market ? 
  which is a very technical thing , which requires very petty and very precise legislation . 
   well , speaking finnish is as much a part of finnish speaking swedes ' culture as speaking swedish is part of swedish speaking finns ' culture now , is n't it ? 
  we 're not talking about the odd emigre , there are significant populations of the respective minorities in each country . 
  i can agree that we 're not talking about a single immigrant , and that there are large finnish communities in sweden , however they are * all * immigrants to sweden . 
  they all made the move to sweden knowing they 'd have to adopt the swedish culture . 
  the swedes who lived in finland in ye olden times were their from the start of finland . 
  that 's what 's important here . 
  the swedes in finland did n't immigrate ( well , some of them did ) they are part of finland from the beginning . 
  the fins in swede * did * immigrate and * chose * to leave behind their own culture . 
  this is the thing about countries and immigration , you accept what 's already there . 
  immigrants make their decision to adopt the new culture . 
  they know they 'll have to learn the language . 
  but if you , and a bunch of other people with other languages decided to start your own country , you get to pick what languages you speak and if you speak multiple . 
  the people who made sweden , spoke one language . 
  the people who made finland spoke two . 
  therefor , immigrants respect the status quo . 
  you ca n't just ignore this bit of the history and create this very simplistic view . 
  furthermore , i do n't know why you see it as obnoxious . 
  the fins want to have two languages , and they like that . 
  most other countries do n't want to have two languages , and finland 's fine with that . 
  there 's no reason to judge each other on this one . 
  surely different countries have their own special ways of working and we might as well just let run their country as they please , without simplifying it down to human characteristics ? 
  i mean , you ca n't give a nation person like qualities . 
  nations are not people . 
  countries can not be snooty , or obnoxious . 
  they just be . 
  and they do . 
  the title of this post is a bit sensational . 
  to be fair , in greece sodomy is n't illegal , it 's just that the age of consent is different . 
  whilst i would prefer they be the same , it 's no where near as bad as criminalisation of homosexual acts . 
  it 's just a two year difference in the age of consent . 
  not exactly like you 're beheading them or anything . 
  and ** northern cyprus is not part of the eu ** . 
  it 's like saying something 's illegal in china ( mainland ) therefor it is also illegal in taiwan , because china ( mainland ) claims that taiwan is its sovereign territory , which ( in practice ) it is not . 
  the same is true with northern cyprus . 
  an eu state ( cyprus ) claims that the north of the island of cyprus is under control of the cypriot government ( which is an eu member state ) * however * in practice the north of the island of cyprus is autonomous and completely not under the control of the cypriot ( the eu member state ) government . 
  you ca n't claim that northern cyprus is part of the republic of cyprus , and then also acknowledge that norther cyprus is the one making the laws . 
  either you acknowledge that the land belongs to the republic of cyprus and then use cypriot law for your map * or * you acknowledge that northern cyprus is a break away region with its own laws and therefor * not part of the european union * .
