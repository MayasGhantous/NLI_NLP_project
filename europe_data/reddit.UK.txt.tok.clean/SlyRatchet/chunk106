  seems kind of odd to be cutting government spending given his back ground , eh ? 
  i agree that op 's edit here  edit : as of 17:27 only `` 68 % like it '' , seems like that 's a bit too low to have this actually done unfortunately . 
  seems a bit premature . 
  just because the up-vote/down-vote thing does n't look favourable is n't reason enough not to do it . 
  the up votes and downvotes are very much dependent on who happens to look across it . 
  furthermore , the up votes and down votes are n't necessarily `` i agree '' or `` i do not agree '' . 
  people do n't really see it like that imo . 
  but yeah , do n't throw away the idea because it got a few downvotes . 
  an mep is a member of european parliament . 
  the european parliament is the legislature of the european union . 
  it 's the only directly elected institution in the eu , although you could argue the council of ministers is directly elected but that 's another story . 
  anyway , an mep or even an mp or what ever you have in germany ( bundes pr\u00e4sidenten ? 
  is expected to , you know , work . 
  however , this guy appears to be signing in at an hour which makes it highly unlikely he 's actually been working and is instead just falsifying or being dishonest to get a pay check from tax payers . 
  ** tl : dr ** a member of european parliament is probably pretending to work when he is n't and then getting paid for it because he 's abusing the system . 
  however there is a little doubt over this . 
  i mean , the clip hardly proves he actually did anything , though it does make it look very likely . 
  i 'm slightly sceptical that he has done anything , so ill give him the benefit of the doubt . 
  i 'm not going to let him of completely though . 
  i wo n't say he 's innocent , but i always wont say he 's guilty . 
  here 's my post from another thread . 
   do we actually know if the italian mep can speak english ? 
  all we know is that he can say `` hmm ? '', 
  and `` i do n't understand . '' . 
  one of the first things i learnt about german was how to say `` excuse me '' and `` i 'm sorry '' . 
  it 's been over a year since i started learning and i would n't be able to understand if someone said `` do you have any expenses ? '', 
  or something . 
  the word expenses is quite a complicated one , and a politician might not want to try and speak a language he is utterly feeble at . 
  for instance , one of the bbc press hounds surprised merkel at some hotel in northern ireland where she responded in quite reasonable english ( similar to this man 's level ) `` we have already had the picture taken '' . 
  however , do you ever see merkel speaking on tv in english ? 
  ok , that 's my defence of the guy . 
  however , if what the presenter is accusing the guy of is true , which there is quite a high possibility of , the guy 's an utter scum bag . 
  note , it 's also just the guy and not the european parliament as a whole . 
  so , do you follow the news about self driving cars much ? 
  that definitely should have been an option . 
  the eu could become more democratic itself in a variety of ways , but it could also push for more democracy in just about all of its member states . 
  at the moment , the eu 's putting a lot of pressure on places like greece which appears to be leading to less democracy which is pretty bad . 
  second largest producer of natural gas in the world , for an average sized european country is n't bad . 
  especially when you compare it to russia , the usa , libya , saudi arabia , iran , iraq , ect . 
  not bad . 
  not to mention all the positive stuff the oil money goes towards . 
  wow , for a country the size of norway to be outselling a country the size of mother russia , that 's pretty impressive . 
  this might sound silly , but are the newspapers/newsites criticising the politician ? 
  i mean , italian newspapers are n't the best in the world what with berlusconi and everything . 
  it 's one of those irritating situations where both people are just frustrating . 
  like islamic fundamentalists and the english defence league or nigel farage ( ukip ) and alex salmond ( scottish national party ) .

  what stops all the british/french/german members of parliament from being liked that italian mep ? 
  nothing . 
  are all british/french/german members of parliament like that ? 
  just because they can be , does n't mean they will be . 
  felt like it ended a bit suddenly . 
  things i know about wales * there 's white on its flag * there 's green on its flag * there 's ~ ~ orange ~ ~ a reddish colour on its flag * there 's an ~ ~ orange ~ ~ reddish dragon on its flag * it 's next to england * sheeps * umm , they speak welsh . 
  kind of * there 's a dragon on their flag * / u/g _ morgan has a welsh flag next to his name, 
  i 'm uncertain what the benefit is then . 
  surely it means the money is not quite ending up in china which was part of the intentions ? 
  so we should n't do things unless the benefit is immediately apparent to any one who knows everything about it , even if they are reading some shitty and very biased tabloid ? 
  i think it 's kind of stupid to say that `` the benefit should always be apparent '' . 
  no it should n't . 
  whether or not the benefit is easily visible has very little to do with whether it 's a good idea or not . 
  truth is not a democracy . 
  it does n't matter how many people are convinced . 
  every one can believe something and it can still be wrong . 
  likewise , there can be something which absolutely nobody believes and it still be right . 
  truth is not democracy . 
  yeah , for me , this obama trip looks kind of wasteful , but what the fuck do i know ? 
  just listen to yourself  i think the benefit should always be apparent to even the ** stupidest ** of people . 
  so whenever the government does anything they should make sure that 100 % of the country thinks they 're right in doing it ? 
  do you know that we would never have a government which does anything if that happened ? 
  you can never get every one to agree on the same thing . 
  ever . 
  just look at this here . 
  there will always be someone who disagrees . 
  out of curiosity when were the last elections and when are the next ones ? 
  i still think that 's relatively interesting . 
  just going some where and deciding to stay for a while , and find a job there is inspiring . 
  even if a principle qualification for your job was speaking english , there 's a huge range of jobs available for people who speak english natively all over the eu . 
  so you 're not necessarily * that * untypical , in terms of someone of british nationality . 
   `` uncharted territory '' for some reason i found this [ hilarious ] ( http://www.bz-berlin.de/multimedia/archive/00430/merkel_neuland1_43003918.jpg ) . 
  i think it illustrates some people 's open of merkel 's `` neuland '' thing quite well . 
  this is n't particularly relevant for eu travel , but i think this video does a good job of making the  you 're always going to need to leap if you actually want to go , you can always make an excuse not to do something . 
  point http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzquewshwms the relevant bit is near the beginning, 
  could you elaborate ? 
  like where you started off , where you moved to , difficulties , surprises and what skills you started with ( such as languages ) ? 
  it could be an uplifting tail for some who are uncertain, 
  and make a pan-national army ? ... 
  a pan - * european * army ? 
  i mean , surely it would make more sense to have it one an eu wide level ? 
  just think of how efficient it could be in terms of cutting costs and the tactical capabilities created . .
