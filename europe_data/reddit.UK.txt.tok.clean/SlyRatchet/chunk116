  furthermore , just because the language has died does not mean that camera angle , as you so aptly put it , is dead to the world . 
  we have many ways of learning these languages after the last native speaker died . 
  even in this article , it states that there are over 40 non native speakers of the language . 
  we can still use these camera angles if we so desire . 
  additionally , why is it so sad that the last native speaker died ? 
  surely , the languages gradual decline is more sad , and surely it is of no loss to anyone , apart from that last speaker . 
  nobody 's life has lost any of its value due to this language 's death ( though the family of the woman who died certainly lost something ) . 
  nobody could see the world through the lens of this language . 
  learning that language and being able to interpret the world through it , is not something we 've lost . 
  it 's just something that you and me have never had the privilege of doing . 
  additionally-additionally : wo n't there be more languages in the future which are completely distinct from the languages we have now , and will have just such a fascinating way of viewing the world ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  i want someone to explain why they are sad for this ? 
  i do n't really find myself caring at all , and i want to know why other people feel differently . 
  edit : ~ ~ i 'm not criticising people for caring . 
  i 'm just curious and wanting people 's opinions . 
  no need to down vote me for asking an honest question , jeez . ~ ~ edit 2 : edit 1 no longer makes sense . 
  i suggest reading much more about them before you actually give them money , or even your public or private support . 
  it 's very easy for charities to be misleading . 
  for instance , there is that cancer charity in the usa ( i forget the name ) which only sends 20 % of its funds onto actual cancer research , and instead sues other cancer charities for using their trademark pink colour or for using some catch phrase which they trade marked . 
  i would n't give that cancer charity a penny now , however , before i found that out , i would n't have though much about giving it my charge or even a real donation . 
  i was just convinced that it was a good charity , because i did n't read and i did n't think about it . 
  now , before i support any charity i want to know i understand it and that i know the money is spent in a way i appreciate and for causes i believe in . 
  i believe that there needs to be greater equality for women throughout europe and the western europe , but definitely in other regions of the world ( africa , middle east , ect ) . 
  however , i 'd be wary of just going out and supporting any random pro female equality charity , because they might bring with them some undesirable traits , like being overly conservative , working against other pro equality movements/charities or not spending money efficiently . 
  what i do is google around and find * one * charity for each cause i believe in and then stick with that charity . 
  if they make good value for money , then i should n't need to be disappointed later on in time or feel the need to switch charities . 
  this group sounds * reasonable * from their add , however i 'm not going to support it because i know nothing more about them than what i have seen in this video , and that is not nearly enough for me . 
  brioche  cake even better !, 
   they invented the democracy . 
  wrong . 
  people who lived in greece approximately 2300 years ago were the first people recorded using democracy . 
   greek government are elected by greek people . 
  representative democracy . 
  the people do n't make the decisions . 
  they delegate that power to their elected representatives who make decisions on the behalf of the people . 
  greek government = / = greek people . 
  if the greeks actually had democracy in the style they had it 2300 years ago , then the greek people would be directly responsible because that style of democracy was direct democracy , which meant that every citizen voted on every single issue ( even though citizenship was heavily limited ) . 
  the modern hellenic republic ( aka greece ) does not have direct democracy . 
  it has representative democracy . 
   it received a 7.5 bn euro bailout in 2008 , but it ** has now repaid the loans ** . 
  what debts ? 
  baltics strong, 
  i love being smug !, 
  it was my parents job to look after me and prepare me for adulthood . 
  i still thank them for it . 
  they did n't do a bad job . 
  just like the bus driver and the cashier did n't do a bad job , so i thank them . 
  they did n't have to do it to the standard that they did , but they did and i appreciate it . 
  looks like boris did actually sell the design abroad !, 
  either [ this big ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/first_south_yorkshire_volvo_single_deck_bus_no._60709_in_pinstone_street_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1254625.jpg ) or [ this big ] ( http://www.photo-transport.co.uk/buses/artic-conquest/first-york-10042-w129dwx-apr04.jpg ) or maybe even [ this big ] ( http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8323/8110327912_353d6b2123_o.jpg ), 
  in my country , the waiters and waitresses come over to you ever two bloody minutes to ask us if we 've decided to order . 
  there 's plenty of space in the restaurant/caf \u00e9 . 
  i like to have a good think , and it 's not like we 're keeping other people out . 
  leave me alone . 
  truly a strange custom , as opposed to the custom they have in the netherlands , among other places , where you have to walk up to the waiter/waitress/server and ask tell them you want to order or that you want a refill , ect . 
  i like it that way . 
  why ca n't they all be like that ? 
  the patron asks for things , and the establishment gets them and charges you later . 
  i was objectifying them , not judging them . 
  or even if you do as-level government and politics in the uk . 
  you do n't necessarily learn it , but you 're supposed to . 
  it 's part of the curriculum . 
  sorry , i know the difference . 
  but dyslexia . 
  reach for one word and grab another by accident . 
  i keep telling myself to proof read more , and if i had here i would have corrected it . 
   all purposes being governed as a german colony that 's quite an extreme statement . 
  sounds a little bit sensationalist , even . 
  i 'm aware of the council of europe and all its functions . 
  i usually consider the council of the eu and the ~ ~ council of europe ~ ~ * european council * to be one body , so i got confused as to what they were , until i read the explanation . 
  so i * kind of * know what they are , but not well enough to identify them easily . 
  i 'm also vaguely aware of what they do , in that it 's part of the intergovernmental part of the eu , but i ca n't get * much * more specific than that . 
  but yes , the names are stupid . 
  additionally , there 's also four people who hold the title `` president '' within the european union . 
  president of the council of the european union , president of the european commission , president of the european central bank , president of the european parliament . 
  i think this is all due to problems with translation . 
  president means pretty much the same thing in every language , where as leader , overseer , chief , commander , ect are not necessarily present in every language . 
  however , it 's still stupid and they should have found a better multi lingual way around this problem . 
  in the same vein , [ this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/wunderbar/gleichberechtigung-uni-leipzig-nutzt-weibliche-bezeichnungen-a-903530.html ) article is talking about how there 's a movement in the university of leipzig to have more gender equality in the way german job descriptions are made . 
  for instance , the word teacher is `` der lehrer '' but the word for female teacher is `` lehrer * in * '' . 
  the word for student is `` der student '' and female student `` die student * in * '' . 
  you get the idea , add `` in '' onto the end of every role which is played out by a female . 
  leipzig university has strangely decided to make all job descriptions female . 
  it 's kind of like deciding that all kings from now on will be called queens . 
  but queens wont have to change their names to kings , and just stay being queens . 
  that 's what i understood from this anyway . 
  my german 's not actually that great , but thought that this was relevant here , but perhaps too niche to make it to the actual front page on / r/europe, 
  behaviour . 
  i had a great as-level politics teacher in sixth form who always used to make sure to tell us the interesting tid bits about political life ( party whips kicking the ambassador of belgium down the stairs , gordon brown 's news sandwich , tangerinegate , ect ) . 
  so she used to show us the highlights of all the heckling . 
  denis skinner is absolute gold in the commons . 
  i do n't know what you 're all getting so upset about . 
  she brings her baby into parliament . 
  so what ? 
  if the baby disrupts proceedings then the president can tell her/it to leave . 
  if this happened often , they 've have made a rule to keep it out . 
  as they have n't all must be going well and why would we fix something which is n't broke ? 
  there 's nothing much to see here apart from a public servant bringing her baby into work , which is not an entirely uncommon practice . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsaa9vmwoai ) is the house of commons and i think it gives an impression of how loud the national chambers of parliament are , and how a baby would n't actually have much of an affect .
