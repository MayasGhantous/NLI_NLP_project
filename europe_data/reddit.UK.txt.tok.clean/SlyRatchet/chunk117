  tbf the european parliament does * seem * * a lot * quieter than this . 
  however , i get the impression that if you were actually in that chamber there would be huge amounts of noise , which viewers do not hear due to the way every parliamentarian has a microphone just for them . 
  a chamber full of ~ 500 men and a lot of hard surfaces which reflect the sound , is not going to be quiet especially considering that the eu parliamentarians like to converse with their neighbours . 
  depends on the idea . 
  do all of your government ministers look like fashion models ? 
  why does n't [ theresa may ] ( http://blogs.independent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/may2.jpg ) look like good ? 
  also brian may teamed up with weeble to make this [ song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ellygcwmcay ) . 
  just thought that was relevant . 
  jeez that really does sound like hell . . 
  i hope you have better and more long lasting look inside the union , rather than outside it . 
  i like to think that we 've seen the end of war in the balkans , and that the eu is partially responsible . 
  that 's a bit extreme . 
  i 'd advise you to remember that the grass always looks greener on the other side , and the grass on your side always likes stale and brown . 
  i see my fellow britons exclaim `` they 're only going to take the bins away every * other * week from now on ?!, 
  it 's like living in a * third world * country '' . 
  no it is n't . 
  live inside the uk is exceptionally good and has some of the highest living standards * in all of human history , ever * . 
  likewise , life inside the eu is immensly better than life outside the eu , ** especially ** if you live in the balkans . 
  i think you underestimate how much an eastern european , balkan country like croatia has to gain from being in the eu . 
  it 's not perfect inside the union . 
  but it is even less perfect outside . 
  do n't be tainted by the badness here , and remember that just because you know it 's bad here , does n't mean it is n't worse elsewhere . 
  i recon i know the reason why . 
  this is the comment i wrote . 
  i 'd just like to offer one possible explanation for why the author seems to go a bit crazy at the end and start implying that * `` maybe philosophy is bad , because , look at this guy that shot himself '' * . 
  specifically these quotes  because one of the effects of having such an ideas-based vision of society , and elevating ideas to such heights , is that people actually start believing in them , and then maybe they start thinking the ideas are worth fighting for , or perhaps dying for , or perhaps even killing for . 
  and then what ? 
    a few days ago , for example , a man shot himself dead in notre dame cathedral . 
   ect this is the bbc . 
  they have to be impartial on * everything * . 
  or at least they 're supposed to be . 
  if they have someone on one of their outlets actually * explicitly * advocating an opinion , then they * must * have someone else there to counter that a opinion to make sure that the bbc remains balanced . 
  i highly doubt that the author thinks that there 's any possibility that philosophy is a bad or dangerous thing . 
  i think she 's either been told or assumed that she is supposed to make it `` balanced '' for the bbc 's impartiality . 
  it 's good that the bbc always tries to provide a balanced judgement and always represent both sides of an argument , however it does sometimes look a little odd when they make articles like this which say basically `` is n't the french system interesting and actually quite good ? '', 
  and then tacked onto the end `` oh , but , you know , maybe it is n't , possibly ? 
  * backtrack backtrack * '' . 
  it 's nice that the eu/european commission has something in place . 
  it feels like we 're all working together to make things better for each other rather than staying isolated and watching each other bear their own difficulties . 
  i do find the thresh-hold thing quite odd though . 
   he normal threshold for activating the eusf for the 3 countries is direct damage of more than $ 1.79 billion for austria ; $ 872 million for the czech republic ; $ 3.67 billion for germany . 
  i guess i know why they have it , but they seem very high . 
  does any one know how much damage the floods have already cost ? 
  or how much/what sort of aid the eu would bring ? 
  because there 's already demand , i mean , the spanish economy is still one of the biggest in the world , even if it is shrinking . 
  do n't make the mistake of thinking that just because things are bad , that they 're the worst they could be . 
  spain is still in a relatively good position compared to really crappy places like the congo . 
  there 's already demand and that demand will hopefully be aided by the increase in consumers ( those newly employed people on the newly lowered minimum wage ) as well as by money that was going to unemployment benefit instead being directed at other programs such as tax breaks . 
  furthermore , efficiency in individual businesses will be increased which will mean lower prices which will mean more consuming . 
  so there 's a lot of demand in the equation and a lot of reason for companies to hire because of it . 
  there are also reasons for companies to hire , not directly relating to the increase in demand . 
    why do n't you think that more people will be hired at lower wages . 
   because , the demand will be lower due to the lower salaries and the country wo n't be attractive to foreign investment due to other issues that are n't being fixed . 
  i think you 're taking the loss of income for workers a bit too far . 
  from a pro lowering minimum wage point-of-view , the loss of income for minimum wage workers would be easily off set by the income granted to new people entering or re-entering the job market with the newly lowered minimum wage . 
  so this would lead to a slight drain in disposable income among a small number of people who have had their salaries cropped , but more money overall would be paid out to individuals , but this money would also be spread out among more people meaning less individuals receiving benefits and more individuals consuming goods which will stimulate demand . 
  in theory , the amount of money being given to low wage workers would be the same as before if not slightly higher . 
  however , it would be spread across more people , meaning a more efficient economy, 
  that 's a bit strong , is n't it ? 
  it does n't sound that unrealistic when you realise that tzfld did n't say how much more homogenous he thought it would be . 
  i reckon that europe is and has been becoming more homogenous since the common market , it has just been becoming more homogenous at a * very * , *** very *** slow rate . 
  there 's more intermingling within europe than there is between europe and the outside world ( apart from maybe between some countries like the usa/australia and the united kingdom , * maybe * ) , or at least that 's been the case in the the last half century . 
  that rate of cultural/ethnic intermingling will probably increase as most of europe tends to get immigrants from the same places and as residents of different eu countries tend to move around more because of the economic situation . 
  as said before , it wo n't be by much . 
  it probably wont be noticeable on statistics , let alone on the streets . 
  but it will be there and maybe if you give it another half century it will be noticeable . 
  it 's common which makes it acceptable for day to day conversation between you and me , however just because it is commonly used but still technically incorrect , does not make it ok to use in official documents which have to be as concise and precise as possible . 
  there is no space for colloquialisms in these texts , they must be official , formal , accurate and to-the-point . 
  accuracy is a key term here . 
  it seems the english thing there 's a lot of rivalries between other countries , but when you ask people from those countries they 're quite surprised . 
  i was listening to a briton and some germans talk about football . 
  apparently we like to think there 's a football rivalry between the english and germans , but the germans completely did n't notice and had a real rivalry with the dutch ( or something ) . 
  i guess we 're a lot more xenophobic and macho than i realised . 
   there saying here is that you need more than 20 different ingredients in your daily intake i do this with my boring british/european food . 
  it does make getting 5 a day quite a lot more easy . 
  basically all i do is whenever i make a sandwich i make sure to add lettuce and other vegetables at the end . 
  or when i want dinner/lunch i 'll cook some pasta or rice and make a stir fry or source . 
  the british way of cooking things tends to be : cook a bunch of things individually ( chicken , carrots , potatoes , beef , ect ) and then put it all on your plate separately . 
  if you cook a bunch of food from the start and mix it together , it 's a lot more tasty and a lot more nutritious . 
  personally i do n't see voter turnout as a reason to lower the requirements to be a citizen . 
  i think that not voting just shows that the electorate is content with the system . 
  if a political party stood up and said `` we will make it easier to acquire passports '' and people then voted for that party , then there would be a reason to do it . 
  however , people not voting is generally interpreted as a sign that the electorate endorses any government that followed ( otherwise they would turnout and spoil their ballot or make the effort to protest vote ) . 
  so , from some perspectives low voter turnout is kind of a good thing . 
  either way , low voter turnout is not a reason to lower the requirment to vote . 
  that 's the right of those who * can * vote to decide , as are most issues of the state ( unless the electorate says to take away certain groups human rights . 
  that 's a tyranny of the majority , ect ) . 
  if you bothered enough to actually examine the information properly , you 'd see that you 're only reading the the statistics for european parliament elections . 
  why did you think that all of the elections are in the same year ? 
  there 's a little drop down menu at the top left which allows you to switch between eu elections ( european parliament ) and national elections . 
  you would have seen it if you 'd examined the information properly or before you posted . 
  voter turnout at national elections ( according to your source ) consistently makes it above 65 % . 
   only about 40 % of the people in the eu actually vote that statistic is false and pulled right out of your arse . 
  go and get a source to back it up . 
  so we should just hand out citizenship will nilly ? 
  oh not this ** again **, 
  well if you want a [ john lennon ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrhq-yo1kn8 ) styled utopia , trying to be like the us probably is n't the way to go about it , but i understand what you 're saying . 
   it would help to make europe more like the us that 's not a very good objective . 
  please do n't think about this on a `` federalism = good '' level . 
  think about what 's actually beneficial for people getting the vote .
