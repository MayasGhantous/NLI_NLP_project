  they could still have flat screen tvs and be getting foot massages and spend hundreds of pounds on their weekly shop at waitrose , but still be considered to be in * relative * poverty because the people at the median ( average ) point in society have yachts and castles and have their own pastry chefs and masseuses . 
  the eu 's poverty indicator is more an indicator of inequality rather than * objective * poverty . 
  [ there 's a lot of good reasons why having a poverty indicator like this is good , and it 's mostly to do with objective poverty indicators being shit , but that 's a different discussion ] so basically , do n't trust those figures , because it is using poverty in a way which you would n't expect it to . 
  it is n't measuring poverty . 
  it is measuring inequality . 
  inequality might be a very worthwhile goal , but having inequality where 25 % of the population ( keeping in mind how large and diverse the eu is ) are 60 % bellow the average is n't that surprising and is almost worth being proud of .

  ^ ( * you know that the olympic games speak english and french because the olympic games were founded by the french and the british ? 
  it is not dependent on which languages are popular . 
  it was contingent on the history of the olympic games . 
  ... we already do that . 
  try mousing over my flair, 
  ok , i 'll let you into a secret , ^ ( but you 've got to be very quiet about it ) ^ ^ shhhh ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ secret ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ wish ^ ^ ^ ^ they 'd ^ ^ ^ ^ hire ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ shill ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ ^ pro-eu ^ ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ such ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ waste ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ bloody ^ ^ ^ ^ time, 
  normally they 're fine , but as soon as i say anything pro-eu i immediately get labelled as a brussels shill , or that i am ideologically driven or some shit . 
  how 'd you get that number ? 
  if you 're basing it off the current number if flairs , then it would be that number and constantly increasing because we are constantly having to add new flairs for obscure regions of europe ( and beyond ) . 
  the official position is that allowing duplicate flags , or even a permanently visible text books ( as in / r/ukpolitics ) would make the sub look too confusing and messy . 
  we do , however , provide the option to have taxt of your choice which is visible upon mouse-hover . 
  for instance , mine says `` pies 'n gravy ! '', 
  because i wanted people to know that i 'm from the best part of the uk ( the north , esp . 
  yorkshire ) . 
  we feel as though this provides everyone with the opportunity to explain most nuisances of their national identities . 
  obviously we 'll listen to your thoughts and opinions ( and there 's nothing you can do about it !, 
  ) , but offer no guarantee that we 'll change the current arrangement . 
  obligatory : if we do n't currently provide a single flag flair of your particular region , then feel free to message the mod team ( address the recipient ( s ) as '' / r/europe '' rather than any specific user ) and we 'll add it . 
  or they consider themselves europeans rather than members of their respective countries . 
  for instance , on / r/untitedkingdom i have an eu flair . 
  what do you mean ? 
  turkey does n't exist . 
  it 's a fictitious country they invented to make world war one films more interesting . 
  so there is a kosovan here !, 
  sorry , but this submission has been removed under rule three , regarding poor citation . 
  the only proof that this headline is correct is that one random redditor on / r/humanporn says it is , but we expect higher standards here on / r/europe . 
  if we really wanted to go that far . 
  i do n't think many people actually care about the symbolism anymore :p it 's just a cool flag, 
  not necessarily . 
  given the the history of the flag , obviously it would make logical sense . 
  but the flag has come to represent more than its component parts , and is now the flag of the uk , rather than merely england , scotland and ireland . 
  there 's no will in ruk for the flag to be changed , so it wont be . 
  ^ ( * exactly !, 
  there is no legal precedent that we can follow !, 
  we have to wait and see what happens and what effects the politics will have . 
  * )  ( eh , nice french !, 
  my deutsch is to bad for writing , but i can still read  das ist vergleichbar mit meine franzi\u00f6sisch !, 
  i can understand the majority of what you say , but i need to refer to the translation in order to reassure myself and naturally i can not write in french at all * ) ^ *  *, 
   l\u2019\u00c9cosse devra demander \u00e0 la rejoindre  * scotland will have to apply to join it . 
  * that is by no means certain . 
  borrosso has spoken as an individual , that scotland would have to reapply , however other senior civil servants of the eu do not agree . 
  it 's actually quite unclear of the scots will join nato and under what terms they would and would not accept . 
  yes . 
  nuclear weapons obliterate themselves . 
  with nuclear reactors they stay radioactive for decades if not centuries . 
  look at chernobyl . 
  i 'm going to bed, 
  read what i say elsewhere in the thread, 
  i 'm sorry , but i think you 'll find that the entire point of having armed forces is to protect people , most of which live in cities like london and new york . 
  that entire aircraft carrier 's job * as well ask all of the armed forces protecting it * are there to protect london and new york . 
  if a group of individuals can punch a hole through that entire security net and into the uk and usa 's largest cities , then how the hell are suppose to expect our carriers to be invulnerable when they are the things on the frontline which are not only up against terrorists , but occasionally well equipped armies . 
  the twin towers seemed pretty safe . 
  i 'd argue that they seemed even safer than a fucking aircraft carrier . 
  did n't stop them getting hit . 
  also , downing street . 
  the ira once dropped a mortar on margaret thatcher in the 1980s . 
  and they also bombed the conservative party conference leading to the death of a prominent conservative . 
  they seemed pretty safe . 
  what about the munich olympics ? 
  what about 7/7 ? 
  american and western military strength might seem unshakable now , but will it in a decade ? 
  what if the chinese start building nuclear carriers ? 
  what if the french get into a stupid war with algerian extremists and their nuclear carrier goes down in the mediterranean ? 
  it 's an accident waiting to happen . 
  just because it has n't happened yet does n't mean it is any less likely . 
  a perfect record * so far * . 
  i would place very high odds that in this 6000 year coalesced life span , that something will go wrong . 
  just one stupid war that the americans have to go into without being properly prepared could cause a fukushima level disaster on an important area of coastline for a hundreds years . 
  the reactors record so far is tiny in comparison to how many years they are going to be in service for . 
   and you think carriers get sunk on a regular basis ? 
  i do n't say this often because i do n't want to be a dick , but seriously , read what i said . 
  i 've already pointed out that they do not get sunk often but that is no excuse for allowing an environmental disaster with a rudder waiting to happen . 
  and of course i would n't advocate dropping any kind of aircraft carrier in the ocean , but seriously , have you not heard how dangerous to life nuclear power is when mishandled ? 
  have you bit heard of chernobyl and fukushima ? 
  do you think that people make such a big deal of those for nothing ? 
  the entire area around fukushima and chernobyl have been and remain evacuated with no signs of people being let back in any time soon for fear of all sorts . 
  i do n't think that would happen it a coal fire station blew up . 
  and there 's a ship off the coast of hawaii which has been pouring tiny amours of oil into the pacific since the pearl harbour attack . 
  life in hawaii seems to have continued fine . 
  do you think that would happen if a nuclear sub sunk off of the coast ? 
  it would ruin hawaii and make the place unlivable . 
  now of course i 'm not saying this is the reasons mr cameron and his mates had for using non nuclear , but it is the reason why i think nuclear air craft carriers are stupid and dangerous to everyone , not jut the people the aircraft carrier is pointed at, 
  there 's a new / r/europe survey being worked on as we speak , 
  sinking ... and then leaning radiation into the ocean for god knows how long . 
  in case it was n't obvious , i was n't saying a nuclear aircraft carrier would explode . 
  if that was all that would happen then i would n't be complaining . 
  the real danger is exactly what you said . 
  they sink and the radiation for decades and a large area of the ocean to become devoid of life, 
  i did n't say a nuclear reactor would lead to armageddon . 
  i said that nuclear weapons could . 
  nuclear aircraft carriers are only an ecological disaster waiting to happen . 
  it 's no big deal if some obscure country 's coastline accidentally becomes irradiated for the next hundred years because some terrorists thought it would be a good idea . 
  it 's an accident waiting to happen,
