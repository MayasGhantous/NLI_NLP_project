  as a consequence he was n't all that clear about what he was saying . 
  however , apart from those criticisms it was pretty error free . 
  you could understand what he was saying most of the time , but sometimes you just had to think about it a little longer and work out what he means . 
  definitely fine to have a conversation with , but i would n't trust him to right up legal documents . 
  interestingly enough he said he thought that before long ( decade or so ) the eu 'll be having english as a sole official language . 
  i was quite surprised . 
  i thought that was more of an idea on the fringes . 
  it 's also interesting how pro eu he was . 
  i mean , i 'm sure it was normal in germany , but it was just the way when people asked him about the problems of the eu he was so unflustered and positive . 
  would you believe me if i said it 's just because i 'm a very intelligent person well acquainted with european affairs ? 
  if no , then it 's because he was going around england to talk to some sixth form students and talk to important british politicians and such like . 
  he was scheduled to go to my school and give a small question and answer thing . 
  he would ask us questions to see what our perception was as a kind of focus group and we 'd ask him questions in turn . 
  so all the german , politics and even history students were alerted and a bunch of us went to participate . 
  it was quite interesting . 
  it proves nothing but that the attackers were muslim , or at least thought they were . 
  they did n't commit the attack because they were muslims . 
  they committed the attack because they 're fucking idiots . 
  you do n't have to be muslim to be an idiot . 
  it 's like those people who try and ban violent video games because they think it will make them go on killing sprees because `` oh look , a lot of mass murders and school shooters played violent video games '' but do you know what else all those murderers and shooters had in common ? 
  they were all fucked up in the head . 
  they were all idiots . 
  these two muslims were idiots just like anders breivik was an idiot just like so many other people were fucking idiots . 
  it 's not the religion or the video game which caused it . 
  they 're smart enough to make their own actions and if they 're not smart enough to make their own actions they should be locked up away from the general public for our safety and theirs . 
  * they * are a danger , not the religion and not the video games . 
  this is one of those weird bits of the internet . 
  why would some one go through the effort to make that ? 
   this thread is about a survey not a mod hate bandwagon ... what it was intended for and what it has become are two separate things . 
  deputy leader of the spd , germany 's second largest political party  do n't ask how i know . 
  i think you guys are a bit too critical of the mods . 
  they 're running this subreddit for us and protecting it from weirdos who 'd ruin all the fun . 
  yes somethings are displeasing , but cut them some slack . 
  it 's not like they 're dictators . 
  please , do n't just hate on them . 
  it 's just that it 's pointless information and it looks like they 're only including it because it supports some daily mail narrative that black people/immigrants cause trouble . 
  if they were white or christian or something , would they include it ? 
  i 'm not so sure . 
  it 's just that saying they 're black adds no more actual information unless you 're trying to indicate a narrative which is all about people being different based on race or where they come from . 
  they 're putting the word `` black '' in the headline because they know it 'll catch the attention of their readership in a `` yep , i knew it . 
  oh gosh those damn immigrants make me so damn mad '' ect , sort of way . 
  that 's why it frustrates me . 
  that probably would have been more fun, 
  i do n't know why the word `` black '' is used . 
  `` two people hack a soldier to death with machetes before being shot by place '' has just as much impact . 
  basically , daily mail is trying to be irritating and xenophobic and anti immigration about this . 
  it 's a sad attack and it is a little peeve of mine , i just think it shows the agenda of the mail quite well . 
  you ca n't have alan davis ether . 
  he want on who do you think you are and turns out he has no welsh ancestry . 
  or something . 
  they mentioned it on one episode of qi when they broke out the flags . 
  they gave alan a welsh flag and david mitchell an english when , then they both told stephen they 'd recently found out they were of different heritage , and then swapped flags with each other . 
  oh btw , you might be able to put david mitchell for welsh . 
  i just remembered . 
  edit : here 's a [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myehyg2n1zm ) of d mitchell sounding clever with a welsh flag . 
  i 'll see if i can find the beginning of the episode . 
  edit 2 : [ here it is ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w084jdrzsjo ), 
  what ? 
  wikipedia says patrick stewart was born in yorkshire , though with the hat on his wikipedia page you could be mistaken for thinking either . 
  i knew taking philosophy would pay off one day !, 
  totally wrong . 
  your suppose to put three entries per country / otherwise , pretty decent :p, 
  is sir tom jones welsh ? 
  perhaps that one guy from acdc ? 
  i do n't really know these people ... 
  well there 's rory mcllroy , the golfing guy from ni . 
  so between us we 've got two . 
  come on , some one ? 
  help ? 
  is it bad that i 'm chuffed to bits that i can name three people from scotland ? 
  i can only name one person from wales and one person from ni though : /, 
  i thought rousseau was from switzerland for some reason . 
  i thought the french invented their own word for email without the acadamie : m\u00e9l , iirc ? 
  in which case i replace him with either axel sch\u00e4fer or angela merkel . 
  hitler , freud and arch duke franz ferdinand for austria . 
  kant , mozart and beethoven for germany . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande ( do n't know how to spell ) , nicholas sarkozy , napoleon . 
  the king of sweden , the queen of sweden and markus person , for sweden . 
  that 's pretty much every country i can remember three people for . 
  ah , no it does not . 
  i 'd call those public sector workers . 
  the public sector in the uk consists of over 5.7 million people . 
  the figure i used refers specifically to full time employees in white hall ministries and government departments under the direct or indirect supervision of a government minister . 
  public sector employees would be told what to do by the civil service . 
  what do you mean by government corporation exactly ? 
  as in quangos which are agencies of government but are run independently of it . 
  or do you mean like private sector employees like nurses in the nhs or members of the armed forces ? 
  or perhaps something else entirely, 
  the commission holds the bit the bit which would typically be called a civil service . 
  the commission is the organ that does the day to day running of the eu , it 's the executive branch , and it is also responsible for both crafting legislation and implementing it . 
  so all civil service style jobs are in the commission . 
  the civil service there run the eu day to day and also write up the legislation for the commissioners . 
  * however * , this is not to say that there are n't other private sector workers outside of the commission . 
  they 're just not civil servants . 
  these private sector workers would be the huge number of translators who work in the european parliament and the people who are responsible for the up keeping of the building ( it technicians , ect ) . 
  there are obviously government employees in other areas , but they 're just not members of the civil service and are not responsible for anything legislation wise or in terms of running the government . 
  yes , my text book :p [ found this though ] ( http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/facts/statistics ) [ and this for the european union 's civil service ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/docs/europa_sp2_bs_cat-sexe_x_dg_en.pdf ) [ it was on the european commission 's official page ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/about/figures/index_en.htm ), 
  in retrospect i think it was just because every time some one said a single bad word about serbia in that thread you 'd fly off the handle and take the insults personally . 
  but it seems you just take most information that way .
