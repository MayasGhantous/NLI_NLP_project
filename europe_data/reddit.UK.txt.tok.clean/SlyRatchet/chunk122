   dubbing anything , regardless of language , is a deadly sin in my book . 
  me and my siblings were playing sonic the hedgehog c. 2000 and found the american accents to be so appalling that we switched the language to japanese with english subtitles . 
  it was a good decision , even so many years on i remember that american tv accent . 
  it was horrible . 
  ( note : not all american accents . 
  just * that * american accent ), 
  there 's a difference ? 
  because i tagged your name after you went off ranting about how the serbians were completely justified in invading bosnia and herzegovina and all the associated killings , ect . 
  you definitely had no eu or italian flag then and you did n't for many days after . 
  it was pretty clear you were serbian, 
  insight is correct here . 
  i think the mods are doing a good job at * combating * xenophobia . 
  i just also think that it 'd be nice if the community got to put in more of a word . 
  though there are inherent problems with that , such as the community potentially being stupid . 
  my english is not so good :p seriously , for a native speaker you 'd be amazed how many mistakes i make . 
  my favourite so far is when i tried to tell some one that what they had written was interesting , so i accidentally said `` i 'm interesting '' instead of `` i 'm interested '' . 
  eh , those figures are n't really relatable . 
  for example , these are examples of public sector jobs ( taken from your link , in fact )  * direct administration funded through taxation ; the delivering organization generally has no specific requirement to meet commercial success criteria , and production decisions are determined by government . 
  * ** publicly owned corporations ** ( in some contexts , especially manufacturing , `` state-owned enterprises '' ) ; which differ from direct administration in that they have greater commercial freedoms and are expected to operate according to commercial criteria , and production decisions are not generally taken by government ( although goals may be set for them by government ) . 
  * partial outsourcing ( of the scale many businesses do , e.g. 
  for it services ) , is considered a public sector model . 
  so , according to that model it would include the entire of the armed forces , the entire of the health service and virtually everyone employed by the ~ ~ crown ~ ~ * state * . 
  where as the number of employees in the european commission is limited only to civil servants and the 27 ( 28 ) members of the european commission . 
  so your figure includes far more than simply the danish civil service . 
  however , the british civil service has roughly 500,000 people in it compared to the civil service of the european union which is a meagre 23,000 people . 
  also , for reference the uk private sector ( the statistic you used for denmark ) is 5.7 million . 
  source : http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/q3-2012/stb-pse-2012q3.html, 
  in the british civil service there are approximately 500 000 civil servants . 
  in the european union there are a mere 23 000 civil servants . 
  there are n't that many bureaucrats in the european union and there are no where near as many as national bureaucracies . 
  there 's positives and negatives to both sides of the argument . 
  i do think racism is a serious problem here and the mods are the only ones with a real incite into its full scale . 
  in some of the big threads the racist comments are either deleted or downvoted to the bottom , however in a lot of the smaller ones you notice it is n't . 
  it 's floating at the top and it puts people off . 
  i find it wholly unpleasant to be in a thread with such people who take ideas about eugenics seriously . 
  i know there are a lot of people who 're put off from visiting / r/europe because of a lot of the racist stuff and it could be much worse . 
  if it was more prolific i probably would n't visit here anywhere near as often . 
  so , there are potential positives for having greater moderator control . 
  however i do also acknowledge there are negatives . 
  i would on the whole like the community to be in greater control . 
  but i 'm not unsatisfied with the status quo . 
  i thought you were serbian ? 
   it is about fucking time that this makes the news , but i do n't hold my breath : it will be forgotten in two weeks , no it wont . 
  people will stop reporting it because most of their audience knows now . 
  the purpose of the press and the media is to educate us . 
  once we 've been educated , we do n't need it to be thrown down our throats for the rest of eternity . 
  we know now that apple , google , starbucks and all the rest are tax avoiding sods . 
  we 'll remember . 
  the information is out now . 
  the press knows this and they know that if they just keep recycling the same stuff that * we already know * we 'll get bored . 
  as we have every moral right to . 
  the news articles will stop being published , as should be the case . 
  we will remember , as we should . 
  what 's more important than the newspapers and media knowing we know , is that the politicians know . 
  they know we 're all pissed at companies like apple and google and starbucks . 
  they know we want something done and come the next elections , in fact , right now all the national governments have acknowledged that we 're pissed off at these tax avoiders and are starting to do something . 
  this is the natural cause of investigative journalism . 
  there 's absolutely nothing wrong with this cycle . 
  it gets stuff done . 
  whenever something paints a picture so black and white as this , i start to wonder what its agenda is . 
  basically , i 'm not sure this is an entirely truthful picture of the situation . 
  if it is , then that 's horrible , but i also think that they might be going to the absolute extreme worst individuals in the worst place and then portraying them as if they 're omnipresent . 
  what i 'm trying to say is , just be skeptical . 
  the mods wanted it that way , basically . 
  there 's difficulties getting the moderators and the community here to agree on things . 
  for instance , there 've been huge calls for one of the moderators to be removed and yet the moderators have done nothing but state that he 's innocent . 
  the community and the mods ca n't come to any agreement , so the mods get their way . 
  there 's benefits and negatives to this modus vivendi . 
  i would like the community to be in true control ( which is n't the case ) , but there is definitely an argument that without heavy moderation racism and xenophobia here would just run rampant and ruin the sub . 
  it 's a sort of ` they 're willing to make a hard decision , but they 're smart enough to make it , when the community is not ' sort of thing . 
  it 's not unlike an argument for representative democracy but now i 'm going on a tangent . 
  so basically the mods are very worried that xenophobia will take hold here , which is something nobody wants ( apart from xenophobics ) . 
  apart from canada and russia who get thousands of kilometres worth of new farming and living space to match the farming and living space lost in hotter countries . 
  also , obtaining arctic oil will be much easier for them . 
  it 's not so bad for them , especially in relative terms . 
  though if we start taking an even longer term view , the situation might tip , even for them . 
  i do n't know why they would do that . 
  it seems odd to divide up the country 's land area between its constituent countries , but not its water area . 
  as i said in another post , i 'm not quite ready to admit i 'm wrong because it seems as though the information is very fine and this point and there are a lot of variables and a lot of odd information/sources . 
  [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geography_of_england ) says england 's land area is 2 % smaller than it 's total area ( 130,395 km ^ 2 ) making it 127,787.1 km ^ 2 england has a population of 53,012,456 . 
  which works out to 414.85 / km ^ 2 i find this to be odd . 
  why does the amount of sea territory of the netherlands make its population density so much smaller than it would otherwise be , but not for england ? 
  i think this is becoming more trouble than it 's worth . 
  perhaps i 'll stave off from saying that england , if it was independent , would be the most densely populated non micro state in europe . 
  at least until some one can wight up all the variables . 
  ether way , it 's going to be a fine line . 
  how do you know it 's land and see ? 
  or that england 's does n't also include land and sea ? 
  bbc backs me up saying the netherlands is 42,000 km ^ 2 ( rounded to three significant figures ) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17741091, 
  personally i 'd trust the wikipedia page of the specific country , rather than a weird wikipedia page dedicated entirely to listing population density . 
  also , that wikipedia page uses the `` official world population clock '' as a source , rather than census information like the the pages dedicated to england and the netherlands do . 
  i 'm gon na see if i can find some way to accurately get the land area of these two entities . 
  source please . 
  i know wikipedia is n't a definitive source , but it 's more reliable than your wide . 
  [ england ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/england ) : 407/km2 [ netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_netherlands ) : 404.3 / km2 edit : [ source for england 's population ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/uk-census/index.html ) source for dutch population http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?dm=slen&amp;pa=37943eng&amp;d1=0-9&amp;d2= ( l-16 ) - l & la = en&hdr = t&stb = g1 & charttype = 1 & vw = t, 
  the thing is , greece is probably going to have all the problems the north has , and they 're probably going to hurt greece much more . 
  i mean , more heat ? 
  i , in britain , would n't mind , but in greece it means you 're going to be borderline dangerous levels of sun . 
  but more importantly , as an example , is the rising see levels . 
  yes , the uk and other places will be very hard hit .
