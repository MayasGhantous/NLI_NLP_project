  if any one 's on a diet googling the word `` cake '' and then going onto the image section : bad idea . 
  if i was the sort of person who went on diets , i 've had broken right then . 
  however , seeing as i 'm not on a diet , there 's an amazing little chinese cake shop at the end of division street in sheffield . 
  i believe that 's where your hidden gem has gone to  muhahaha [ * scoffs down a piece of elegant chocolate fudge cake * ] ( http://www.hillside.org.uk/images/chocolate-cake-recipe.jpg ) edit : [ * with a nice hot cup of tea * ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nvkpljxtbtc/tui5y5dcmbi/aaaaaaaaaem/dvsgtckyppy/s1600/457983__a_cup_of_hot_tea.jpg ), 
  you get points for being best , not first . 
  the first cake ever made was probably pretty crappy compared to this [ glorious piece ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_448/recipes/easy_chocolate_cake_31070_16x9.jpg ) . 
  that 's all mostly true . 
  unless you 're the uk . 
  then you get to be first even though you do n't even have gay marriage . 
  *** take that scandinavia !, 
  *** * who 's utopian now !, 
  it 's very interesting how the language of european politicians changes over the years in regards to the future of the eu . 
  it looks like all the eu countries are slowly starting to decide where the stand on the issue , and work towards that future goal . 
  so now we know where the current french government stands . 
  i wonder if it 'll stick . 
  to be fair , ukip attracts the crazy anti outside world people because theyre the most right wing nationalist * mainstream esc * party . 
  crazies might be largely ukip , but ukip is n't necessarily largely crazy . 
  i mean , from my point of view it is largely crazy , but not * that * crazy . 
  i strongly disagree with ukip , but if you 're going to disagree with them you might as well disagree with them on solid ground . 
  i do n't feel qualified to comment on other nations with different languages and cultures . 
  i have a hunch the same applies , but i do n't have anywhere near as an in depth of an understanding with places like france and germany and spain as i do of places like america , australia , ect . 
  when i 've learned german and spent some time there , i 'll feel qualified to at least speak about germany and maybe austria , switzerland . 
  maybe . 
  when i see all the english speaking countries being ranked as extremely tolerant my immediate conclusion was that people doing the survey thought `` this question is asking me if i 'm racist . 
  racism is bad . 
  i do n't want to be bad , so i 'll say i 'm not racist . '', 
  or something a long those lines . 
  i definitely think more than 5 % of the uk population is at least a little bit racist , however , most of them probably just do n't acknowledge it to themselves and were smart enough to realise what the question was asking . 
   we 're also one of only ~ ~ countries ~ ~ * sovereign countries * in europe to have a diagonal line in their flag . 
  and perhaps the only one in western europe . 
  do n't worry , we 've got most of the world 's economists trying to answer this question . 
  [ ** '' ** found ** '' ** ] ( http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dr-evil-air-quotes.gif ), 
  we 're also one of only countries in europe to have a diagonal line in their flag . 
  and perhaps the only one in western europe . 
  i tell ya ' , removing one and two cent coins is like the gay marriage movement . 
  everyone will do it eventually . 
  this century will be defined by how progressive we 're becoming !, 
  and the two things that will exemplify that are equal rights and coinage !, 
  most of the good ideas for currency like that [ japanese yen ] ( http://www.djbreslin.com/dj/images/japan200103/japanesecoins_large.jpg ) ( ie , having holes in them so you can ty string through ) thing were already taken , so we had to make it unique somehow . 
  so we decided to make it look like there 's a system in the way we do our [ coins ] ( http://www.englishexercises.org/makeagame/my_documents/my_pictures/2010/jan/eac_great-britain-coins-money.jpg ) , but actually it 's all just a myth to confuse tourists and make it look like we 're different . 
  or we could just look at all the other countries which have done this so far like the netherlands , finland , new zealand , australian and canada and see that there is already no problem with this and that we might as well push away without needing to prove anything to ourselves because five other countries have already proven that nothing will happen apart from having a ( slightly ) more efficient economy and government budget, 
  once , i went to buy # 4 worth of stuff at a self service checkout with # 3 in change and a fiver . 
  i put in all my crappy change and then just paid with the fiver anyway . 
  then it gave me back my # 3 of change ( mostly coppers ) in pounds coins !, 
  it was a happy day when i realised that if you put in change and over paid , they would n't just return the coins anyway . 
  somehow i always assumed they would do that . 
  happy days . 
  i for one love impressing my fellow drug lords . 
  i know very much what you 're saying . 
  the thing is , rating agencies are one of those things where when they screw up , every one hears about it . 
  if i screw up , no one hears about it and i can move on , but with ratings agencies that never goes away . 
  i know they 're not perfect . 
  everyone should know that . 
  but they 're good enough for most of the financiers in the world and if most of the world 's financiers will trust them , they 're probably good enough for me to trust to . 
  at leas to trust with some skepticism . 
  i know we do n't tend to trust the finance industry or bankers or anyone like that , but they do do a lot more than we often give them credit for and they are a lot more intelligent than we give them credit for . 
  and you 're not being at all patronising ? 
  like i said , no one is going to look at fitch putting greece from ccc to b as `` greece will now become a thriving economy once more ! '' . 
  no one 's getting their hopes up , we 're all merely surprised . 
  this is genuinely positive news . 
  some of the first significant positive news . 
  the fact that fitch is now saying that greece wo n't necessarily implode is huge . 
  it by no means guarantees success , but it is positive and i 'll take that at face value . 
  that 's what we 're all doing . 
  you just seem to be ignoring that anything positive could be happening in greece . 
  no one is sure if it , but at least it 's a possibility . 
  fitch is saying it 's a possibility . 
  i trust fitch over you any day . 
  what fitch is saying is not unreasonable . 
  it 's not like they 're even predicting recovery , they 're just predicting that it might not collapse . 
  stop pitying yourself . 
  an improvement in confidence is an improvement . 
  a shift from `` sell '' to `` do n't buy '' is an improvement . 
  you seem to be taking an extremely negative view of this . 
  it is one good thing in a see of misery . 
  that is how i see it . 
  no one here is honestly suggesting that everything is now fixed or that things will improve . 
  we 're just being hopeful . 
  two credit ratings agencies have increased greece 's rating , not just one . 
  the argument you 're having with that greek guy ( i forget the name ) he is giving you lots of slightly positive news , and you 're discrediting it because it 's not positive enough . 
  what are you expecting ? 
  it 's a see of misery and he is pointing at something vaguely positive which might suggest change for the better . 
  that 's what this article we 're discussing means to me and to many others here . 
  it 's not huge , but it 's something and it 's positive and that 's nice . 
  the drop in debt/gdp ratio , that a chinese firm is investing in greece , that the gears of recovery are potentially starting to move ? 
  what are you expecting ? 
  that all of a sudden millions of jobs are going to have materialised ? 
  the first step to a recovery will be subtle and they will probably be things like investments or people making pledges or ratings agencies realising that the country is not going to collapse in on itself . 
  baby steps . 
  at this point i would n't expect anything more from this part of the eu . 
  i agree with what you 're saying , but i just want to say that i 've noticed you do this multiple full stops thing '' . 
  in a few posts . 
  i was just wondering why ? 
  it 's quite odd . 
  which sounds considerably better than ccc  1 . 
  a credit rating used by the s&p and fitch credit agencies for long-term bonds and some other investments . 
  it is equivalent to the caa rating used by moody 's . 
  a ccc rating represents an extremely high risk bond or investment ; banks are not allowed to invest in ccc rated bonds . 
  ** ccc bonds are junk bonds . 
  ** ccc is junk .
