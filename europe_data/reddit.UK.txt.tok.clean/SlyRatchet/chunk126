  b is quite clearly better than junk . 
  there has been improvement , or at the very least , an improvement in confidence . 
   there has been no increase in anything tangible since the onset of the crisis . 
  i 'll leave the credit rating agencies to decide that !, 
  according to [ this wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_federal_legislation ) there are 20,000 acts passed by congress in the usa . 
  i fully expect each of those to be more than ten pages long and most of them are probably closer to 100 pages long so i 'm gon na guess that the us has * a lot * more volume of legislation than the european union . 
  furthermore , this does not include case law or the constitution or treaties or any sort of common law . 
  it does not even include law in specific states . 
  it simply refers to acts of congress . 
  so , the eu 's not doing some bad . 
  it 's still surprising , however , that the eu has this much legislation despite being only 60 odd years old . 
  however , i think this is more to do with the nature of eu legislation and the fact that the eu has 27 official languages and three working languages . 
  so it 's not unthinkable that eu law is actually only one 27th of that figure . 
  however i 'm not certain . 
  tl : dr there 's a lot of things which might make the eu 's number of laws seem bloated such as the nature of legislation it creates ( very specific and highly technical , often ) , the fact the eu has 27 official languages of which all material must be translated between and that the 170,000 figure includes all areas of eu law like court rulings and treaties where as other places laws accede that number simply in terms of acts of parliament ( or acts of congress , ect ) edit : also , if you look at [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_uk_legislation ) and click on the links , you 'll see how many acts the uk has passed and i have a feeling it will rival the us 's 20,000 and i also prior to having a strong parliament which was expected to legislate on all matters , a huge source of uk law was common law , which has been going on for literally centuries . 
  not to mention all the active and innactive treaties the uk by virtue of being a 1,000 year old state ( sort of ) . 
  so i full expect the uk and other european countries with long histories to have much more legislation than 200,000 pages worth . 
  it 's weird , in my mind the border of europe * is * the russian border . 
  like , when i look at a map of europe , russia is always the last border i see and i 've always seen it as kind of different so in my mind , when i think of the edge of europe i always imagine the russian border . 
  it 's completely * factually * wrong , but some how fitting . 
  as i jokingly mentioned in this thread already , i go to talk to axel sch\u00e4fer ( vice chairman of the spd ) and it was interesting his position on the eu . 
  i mean , i was aware that german politicians tended to be quite pro europe but it was interesting that he just had such faith in it and that he was so sure it would continue and so sure that integration would continue . 
  i also was n't aware that any mainstream politicians ( in german ) supported the idea of english being the primary language of europe , which was interesting . 
  i just thought this might be interesting and sort of wanted to get it off my chest as my family and friends do n't seem to care much about an obscure politician from another country 's views :p, 
  quite right , 
  you 've still seem to be discrediting an entire argument based on who supports it . 
  even say , you 're basing this prejudice on certain groups on things that these groups did n't even really say . 
  you 're making mountains out of mole hills with how bad the media is being . 
  and as for people who 've actually * explicitly * stated that we need to go to war : the craziest people are always the loudest . 
   they do n't hold a seat in parliament , do they ? 
  correct . 
  they have no mps , but they do have meps and councillors . 
   are the tories really so scared of being overtaken on the right that they pander to ukip 's views ? 
  it 's hard to tell how the conservatives would be acting if ukip was n't around , but we can be fairly certain they would n't be making pledges to hold referendums if ukip was n't and pledges by some conservative cabinet members to remove the european convention on human rights i reckon is in part motivated by the rise in euroscepticism personified by ukip . 
  so basically yeah , the tories are pandering even more anti europe than they would otherwise be ( and possibly more right wing , but that 's harder to observe ) . 
   it seems that they dominate more and more of the public discourse . 
  is that impression correct or are the papers exagerrating ? 
  i 'm not sure exactly what all the papers are saying , but they seem to be dominating the political landscape at the moment , yes . 
  ukip are taking more and more votes away from the tories and there is a danger that they 'll even chip away at the tory 's mps . 
  they 're a huge phenomenon which is quite scary . 
  what you read in the papers is probably what we read in ours . 
  edit : forgot to add that ukip is n't * that * much of a danger to the mainstream political stuff in westminster as most people see ukip as more of a protest vote and * generally * feel better represented by one of the big two or three parties as ukip appears to be a mostly single issue party ( though ukip claims otherwise ) . 
  but we do n't know if they will make an impact on the house of commons . 
  if they do , it might be go from being scary for the conservatives to terrifying . 
  knew there was something up but i was kind of on a rant . 
  so some elements of the media agree with something and push it in unethical ways , so the idea they support must be bad ? 
  the press sometimes say the genocide is a bad thing , and they use unethical journalistic practices to push that agenda . 
  does that make the idea bad because certain people are pushing their agenda in a bad way ? 
  that makes the journalists pushing it bad , not the idea . 
  additionally , i 've not seen the press being `` pro empire '' or supporting a notion that we should go to war . 
  the only thing that it pushes is that the argentine ** government ** is absolutely stupid ( which there is only * some * truth in ) and that the british government is doing the right thing right now , which is to not negotiate until the argentines step down their demands . 
   i know , referendums etc so what you 're saying is `` well , yeah , of course the uk 's doing everything in a democratic way , but , you know , aside from that they 're just as bad '' well then you have a point . 
  if you strip away all the important bits of the uk argument you end up with the exact same argument that argentina has . 
  that 's why you do n't strip away essential parts of the argument . 
  the uk is doing this in an ethical way and that ethical way is with democracy . 
  do you think that the uk should not be doing referendums or not be doing things democratically ? 
  so yeah , if you strip away all the important stuff and only look at the argument with and ** extremely ** narrow view , it sort of looks similar . 
  however if you actually look at it in detail you 'll find that the arguments are extremely different . 
  please do n't over simplify things . 
  if you ca n't find an appropriate level of detail then you do n't have an appropriate amount of knowledge and therefor should be skeptical of your own opinion as it 's based on such little actual information . 
  it also allowed me to go to poland to see auschwitz as part of the holocaust educational trust to help learn and * understand * about the holocaust which we might not have been able to do if we 'd have needed to apply for visas , ect . 
  my brother would not have been able to work on a documentary which necessitated him traveling through 5 european countries at short notice . 
  my mother has been able to interact with german art students much more easily than if she or they had to get visas every time one of them crossed a border . 
  furthermore , i know that later in my life i will probably go to germany to be immersed in the german language so that i can learn it completely . 
  this would be extremely difficult otherwise . 
  i may decide to find whilst i am there which would not be possible under normal tourist visas . 
  additionally , the difficulties which arise from having open borders are easily solved or not serious problems . 
  illegal immigration is not a huge issue as it does not seriously affect many people . 
  criminals seldom actually benefit from travelling throughout europe and even when they do they are easily tracked using the previously mentioned european arrest warrant . 
  if you stated why you supported the ` las malvinas son argentinas ' point of view maybe you would have better luck . 
  usually with political issues i understand that perhaps for different people , different thinks are the `` right '' thing , but with the argentina/falklands issue i simply do n't see it . 
  perhaps you could elaborate on why you support the argentine claim ? 
  that would be infinitely more interesting than simply spouting that you support it and then expecting to get downvoted . 
   i find the claims of both nations a bit silly . 
  britain claims it because the british empire used force to take the land off the spanish empire . 
  the uk 's claim rests on the fact that it was head of the british empire and therefore still owns the islands . 
  that is not the uk 's argument . 
  the uk 's argument is , and has been for the last 70 odd years since the dissolution of the empire that the people who live on the falkland islands are in control of their own destiny and have the right to self determination . 
  the people of the falklands should decide what happens to the falklands islands via the democratic process . 
  the uk has held referendums in the falkland islands many times , i think one of them was less than a year ago and every time the falkanders have said that they want to remain british ( and who can blame them ) . 
  the uk 's argument is about the rights of a people to choose their own destiny . 
  the argentine ' argument is that the falklands are nearby and also used to be part of the entity that became argentina ( they were never actually controlled by argentina itself ) . 
  argentina does not care for the people who have lived there for generations and thinks that the rights of this region that have never lived on territory belonging to argentina should be ignored . 
  the uk 's argument is much more sophisticated than that . 
  the uk 's argument is about ethics , rights and morality where as the argentine argument is about the acquisition of territory and ignoring the rights of a group of people . 
  please do n't try and say that both arguments are equally flawed . 
  if the falklanders said they wanted home rule or to be part of argentina or anything , we would let them do it without further notice . 
  the same deal with scotland . 
  please do n't try and think that the uk is ignoring the democratic process or that for the uk this is about some aquisition of territory . 
  the mainland uk benefits strategically from the falklands , yes , but they are part of the uk because that is what they wish . 
  edit : disillusion --  dissolution edit : accusation --  acquisition, 
  it 's nice that they 're acknowledging this as a issue . 
  because most parents are like that and seeing as godzilla did n't specify otherwise i 'm assuming he has ordinary parents . 
  basically , given this thread , if he did n't have normal parents i would expect him to specify . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1dzlzx/czechs_and_slovaks_of_reurope_how_would_you_feel/ ), 
  was n't there a thread about this a few days ago ? 
  that and the single market . 
  that and the open borders agreement . 
  and the development grants . 
  and the european arrest warrants for catching criminals across borders .
