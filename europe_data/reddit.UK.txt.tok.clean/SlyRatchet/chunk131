  as some one who 's never been to ireland , it defined my image of ni quite well . 
  right in the feels :(, 
  queuing , moaning and rain . 
  would people fucking make a point when they comment instead of just making passive aggressive comments simply calling the other stupid in some * pseudo * smart ass way . 
  it does n't make you look smart . 
  it makes you look like a dick and an idiot to boot . 
  it does not add anything to the conversation . 
  if you 're going to call some one an idiot , explain why they 're wrong . 
  explain why you 're right . 
  if you ca n't , then i guess the person you 're calling an idiot might just have something you do n't . 
  they definitely have an advantage when it comes to content . 
  you 're taking examples of the eu ** '' ** discriminating ** '' ** against individual regions and acting as if the eu is the only organisation which ** '' ** discriminates ** '' ** against certain regions . 
  it is n't . 
  i 've already mentioned that a lot of uk law is designed for the more populous and metropolitan south/south-east and not the more rural and industrial scotland , wales , north england , ect . 
  i 'm not denying that eu law sometimes benefits one state while disadvantaging another ( though personally i agree on the whole the laws usually do more good overall ) but just because the eu has a lot of people does n't mean it damages specific groups ' interests any more than a small organisation wood . 
  nazi germany was relatively tiny , but they discriminated against the jews pretty well . 
  england even smaller still , but we still manage to discriminate just as much , if not more , than the eu does . 
  do you understand my point ? 
  that has nothing to do with the size of the electorate . 
  this happens * all the time * in just about every country on earth . 
  you do n't even need many people . 
  you could have a population of three and this would still happen . 
  this is what happens in countries , people within them disagree on things . 
  i do n't see how that 's specific to large countries . 
  edit : just some examples of this happening in a smaller country . 
  the uk and the trident missile project , which is vastly unpopular in the region where it is located . 
  the poll tax ( also uk , google it ) . 
   my vote would count less that 's a terrible argument for why an example of a democracy is bad . 
  it 's now about the individual 's ability to effect the political landscape , it 's about the * collective 's * ability to effect the political landscape . 
  your vote is always worth very little and it really does n't matter . 
  the size of the electorate has * nothing * to do with how democratic it is . 
  you could have used a lot of very legitimate arguments here , but you did n't . 
  if i try and make people interested in my city using pictures of it , people are going to leave thinking it 's a very boring place . 
  it 's the life style , jobs , friends , living standards , culture , atmosphere that makes me love where i live . 
  for those wondering , it 's sheffield . 
  whenever you go to town , you 'll * always * meet some one you know and it has a very small but very * very * well designed city centre . 
  despite this , it 's also one of the ten largest cities in the uk with between 500,000 and 2 million residence . 
  it 's very friendly , but you 're also not really isolated . 
  sure it 's not got that huge city feeling like manchester , or london , but you have the economic opportunity and the educational opportunity and it 's not `` slow '' , but it 's not racing fast . 
  you have the chance to chat to a friend in the street because you bumped into them and not be jostled by thousands of commuters . 
  you have the chance to hold the door open for someone even in the city centre . 
  it 's just nice . 
  oh , and you 're never very far away from the countryside and it 's got the most green spaces of any city in england . 
  it is a very pretty city , but comparing it to some of these continental european cities is just too harsh . 
  our cities are n't that beautiful , or at least not in idilic way , but they definitely have their charm , it just ca n't be compressed into a single picture . 
  i thought it was a fridge at first . 
  generally exceptions are made for rogue states like north korea . 
  this is why the desire to stop countries developing nuclear weapons is so high . 
  all nuclear weapons wielding countries also agreed never to increase their arsenal because they do n't like nuclear weapons existing but ca n't get rid of them . 
  i 've never scene a made in europe sticker at all . 
  but migth i ask what the thing the sticker is attached to is ? 
  but i did drop the `` it '' from `` it is more efficient '' . 
  surely i deserve some marks !, 
  it would certainly be a unique angle . 
  you 'd probably corner the market for people going on milf holidays . 
  does n't have a picture of churchill on it . 
  the british # 5er is obviously better . 
  probably terrain difficulties , and also , have you ever wanted to look at a specific street in iceland ? 
  it 's not like there 's many houses to look at . 
  they bring it on themselves , tbh . 
  we love them , but they do n't love us :(, 
  it is the most efficient way . 
  why have many comedians when one will do ? 
  is more efficient . 
  ^ ( what a horrible queen . 
  ca n't see why any one would want her pffft . 
  grr , 1982 . 
  falklands . 
  stupid pope . 
  huff puff , ca n't even speak proper spanish durr dur , ), 
  they 're rumoured to have muslamic ray guns . 
  i saw a top diplomat say it . 
   more than local coverage because ~ ~ bomb ~ ~ * explosion * = terrorism unless you actually stop and think about it . 
  but more seriously , the reason we find terrorism scary is because it could happen to any of us at any time and it could be absolutely horrible . 
  so what i 'm saying , is that terrorism is exactly like a gas explosion . 
  sudden , without warning , horrible , deadly , life changing , and pivotally they are terrifying . 
  that 's why they 're reporting it . 
  it plays on our sense of worry , but also it plays on our sense of compassion and sympathy for those involved . 
  if there was an explosion like that in london or ny i 'd fully expect it to get national coverage because people we know could be there , and who do we worry the most about and who do we sympathise best with ? 
  people we know . 
  prague is n't quite as close , but still warrants attention . 
  judging from the amount of bald eagles in his link , i 'm saying america . 
  now the real fun begins !, 
  i just ca n't english today . 
  also , how we hate benefits scroungers . 
  depending on what part of society you live in , you 're going to be exposed to hating one of those two groups . 
  from the two or so reports i read/watched , that is certainly an element . 
  there is a decent amount of upset from the anti war groups and there was even a march around the area that the drones are being flown from . 
  i think a lot of people feel uneasy about the drones because they tend to kill a lot of civilians in absolute terms ( i 'm not sure how the total amount compared to the amount of hostiles killed though ) and because the west , specifically america , tends to use them a lot . 
  so they 're kind of scary , basically and the media is naturally playing on that a little . 
  it 's not big news though so the media is n't playing on it that hard . 
  as for the pakistan bit , basically there 's just extra unease there because we 're not even supposed to be at war with pakistan and the way the west has treated them feels a bit cruel . 
   the expected government intervention in the teacher lockout has indeed happened . 
  you could n't expand on that at all ? 
  it sounds serious and interesting !, 
  out of curiosity , what do people think of the new king ? 
  good , bad , indifferent , good most of the time but can but sometimes trouble , nice guy but not fit for the throne , ect ? 
  also , i what happened to the prince who 's in a coma ? 
  personally i love it when adverts call me a gluttonous pig . 
  it 's an advert which treats my like what i am and just wants to facilitate that .
