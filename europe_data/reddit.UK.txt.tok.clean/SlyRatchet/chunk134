  i mean , it 's basically just that being in a union is better than the alternative . 
  what sort of thing are people expecting ? 
  i 'm sure i could dig something up if i tried . 
  oh i glanced over a headline about that . 
  do you think you could explain it in a nutshell for me ? 
  i have n't heard anything of farage in a long time . 
  i wonder what he 's up to . 
  probably no good . 
  some how i just assumed the snow in estonia was a permanent fixture , like igloos and penguins in canada . 
  having eight grammatical errors is more than just a mistake , that 's a skill . 
  it takes effort and determination to mess up a sentence that badly . 
  jesus , an official song for the king 's reign . 
  you can just imagine the publicity office ( or whatever it is ) having some sort of meeting where they try and figure out what 's `` cool '' and `` hip '' with `` the people '' or `` the peeps ( gang sign gestured by some oldish guy in a suit ) '' . 
  i basically do n't understand any dutch , but given the context about royals and stuff , something feels really cringy about it . 
  mainly the beginning and the rap bits . 
  i ca n't imagine the british royals releasing a rap video to celebrate charles 's accession . 
  what is the koningslied ? 
  some royal shopping festival ? 
  oh , and the bit about the school shooting is relieving , in a sort of way . 
  if there was a common european army which was commanded by the european commission , i would assume that all countries have to pay in a certain amount relative to their gdp . 
  this is already the case with all eu taxes . 
  germany pays more taxes than lithuania , because germany has more money to be taxed . 
  so when we get onto the question of how we enforce the payment of these taxes , i say , the same way we enforce taxes already : through the european court which imposes fines on member states . 
  what happens if the eu state does not pay its fine ? 
  well , then we 'll have a constitutional crisis . 
  perhaps the eu state would be forced to leave , or at the very least , withdraw from that chapter . 
  basically , the european union is a much stricter organisation than nato . 
  if a country does not do what it 's supposed to in the eu , then the eu does have real and immediate power to punish . 
  nato has no such power . 
  so i do n't think countries not paying their way would be an issue , assuming a common european army was set up properly , which is a big ask . 
  i 'm speaking of an ideal world . 
  a common european army , would probably never come to fruition so i only talk to in pure hypotheticals . 
  by any chance , did you just post that thread which you replied to and then delete it ? 
  seems a little too perfect . 
   now i have never ever seen racism here that 's a bit rich given what you were saying about kosovans a few days ago . 
  i think taenk is actually raising a good point , though i do n't think the switzerland example is helping . 
  the point being `` should europe really be trying to intervene with other people 's affairs ? '', 
  personally i think we should be as militarily isolationist as possible and try and do everything through diplomacy and economics , with the army only existing if we , ourselves , are attacked first . 
  under nato the west has developed a policy of active military participation in foreign conflicts ( iraq , libya , mali , and to a lesser extent the balkans and cold war theatres ) . 
  a lot of people , like myself , i displeased with such a strategy and believe the rest of the world is the rest of the world 's business and that they should sort out their own problems . 
  you raised the issue about `` interests and responsiblities '' are normally the counter arguments to my point of view , but i really do n't think that it 's our job to make the rest of the world a better place and i certainly do n't think a good way of doing that is through military might , not even when they 're committing atrocities . 
  and as for our `` interests '' well , is it right to use an army which kills people to protect our `` interests '' . 
  the eu ( but not so much its member states ) has adopted a foreign policy of diplomacy rather than military intervention . 
  i 'm proud of that and hope it continues . 
  this is by no means a comprehensive list : * better defence capabilities are reached when resources are pooled ( more money , expertise , men , ect ) * potentially less cost on a per capita basis ( no for every nation to have it 's own aircraft carriers or specialised minesweepers when you only need a few ) * a better ability to project a voice on the world stage ( this argument applies to all eu integration really ) * potentially less american ( and co ) influences on european defence policy than currently ( because of nato ) the cost argument ( s ) is by far the most important to me . 
  everything else is really just an extra . 
  there 's obvious potential problems with having unified defence too , but it would be quite bias if i started explaining them . 
  not one argument was mentioned for why we actually need to increase defence spending or increase european integration on defence . 
  that was rhetoric . 
  i 'm for more pooling of eu resources on defence , but they did n't make one argument for why it 's a good idea and they did n't present one argument for why we actually need defence . 
  they just said that we needed it and got a load of people to say some serious things with frightening music playing in the background . 
  that 's not really what he 's doing . 
  most parties wait until closer the election before revealing their policies . 
  why would you release them as soon as your appointed party leader , only to have the opposition party steal your ideas ? 
  that 's why parties usually wait until very close the election and reveal all their carefully planned policies and campaigns all at once . 
  additionally ed miliband is in a very difficult situation because he has to deal with being in new labour , ie post blair labour . 
  so he has to make a lot of difficult decisions about where the party is going and what it stands for . 
  i do n't really blame him for waiting to reveal all his policies . 
  he 's not simply playing the `` oh we hate what they 're doing card '' he 's simply doing what all opposition parties do when they have a new leader , they wait until close to the election to reveal their policies . 
  i have no doubt that come the election labour will have a very full manifesto to choose from . 
  i 'll stave off being highly critical of them until that point . 
  one final point that kind of bothers me and needs addressing on its own . 
   a party that tries to conceal its agenda they 're not trying to conceal their agenda , they simply have n't decided on what it is yet . 
   i 've argued time and time again here against the kind of policies they 're constantly trying to pursue what policies ? 
  ed miliband has n't put forward any policy since he was appointed head of the party years ago . 
  his only policy is to not doing what the conservatives are doing is bad ( somehow ) . 
  i do n't know how you could have opposed any of their policies , unless you 're talking about the policies they had for the 2010 election , which was quite a long time ago now . 
  so , maybe you 're just basing this on , you know , gut reaction ? 
  i 'll adjust my calendar and do it this sunday evening . 
  i 've always thought sunday was good because more people would be at home and we 'd have the entire political week behind us to reflect on . 
  because few member states of the eu would be ok with the eu having its own army : the eu acts in the interests of its member states , so it needs a number of its states to say they want it first . 
  which leads to the other problem of cost , because if they support it , they 're going to have to pay for it . 
  why would a member state or states want to pay for a european army when they could very easily use their own army or simply rely on nato . 
  it 's also worth noting that a european army should n't be in addition to national armies , it should be instead of . 
  you ca n't have a european army and then a french , british , dutch national armies . 
  or at least you ca n't if all these armies have different foreign policy . 
  if the british army has one foreign policy and the european army has another , you could end up with the british supporting ( let 's say ) a libyan government and the eu waging war against it . 
  basically what i mean , is that to have a european army you need every one to agree on a foreign policy and that 's really really hard . 
  just like to say that for the ` what 's been happening in your country/region this week ? ', 
  threads , i 've put on my calendar to make a thread for it every two weeks on a sunday . 
  though i 'm considering making it weekly instead . 
  what do you think ? 
  this a thousand times . 
  that depends entirely on your definition of evidence . 
  this is my definition . 
  it 's from the oxford american english dictionary  evidence | \u02c8ev\u0259d\u0259ns | noun the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid : the study finds little evidence of overt discrimination . 
   \u2022 law information given personally , drawn from a document , or in the form of material objects , tending or used to establish facts in a legal investigation or admissible as ** testimony ** in court : without evidence , they ca n't bring a charge . 
   \u2022 signs ; indications : there was no obvious evidence of a break-in . 
  so what 's the definition of testimony ? 
  - nies ) a formal ** written or spoken statement ** , esp . 
  one given in a court of law . 
  so , you 're lying by saying i 'm lying . 
  but i 'm not going to accuse you of that , because i merely think you 're misinformed or being misleading rather than outright lying . 
  you 're definitely being provocative though and it 's definitely deliberate . 
  you 're also choosing to ignore the deletion of massive posts as any sort of evidence which it sort of is as no one has yet to come up with a valid reason for so many people being banned or threads being deleted so i request of you , that you give us evidence that this was not malpractice . 
  additionally , i would like to reiterate my argument that we 're fucking terrified this subbreddit is going to be ruined by davidreiss . 
  i think the circulation of rumours is enough for a mod to be dismissed . 
  i 'd rather not risk them ruining the sub . 
  and as i have said before , i think it 's in the spirit of democracy that you should listen to those that use this sub and hold a vote to see if any significant number of people actually support him . 
  perhaps some minimum threashhold of support can be set and if it is not met , he be removed ?
