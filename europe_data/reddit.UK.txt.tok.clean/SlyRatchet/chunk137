  i spent thirty minutes searching for information and eventually find an internet site set up by the government where the candidates can leave a little 100 word description of themselves . 
  that 's it . 
  i had 100 words from each of them to decide . 
  i 'm sure if you posted a link to an article about that on the main page , we 'd all find it very interesting . 
  most countries have some form of the act you described . 
  in the uk it 's called the freedom of information act . 
  so we 'd all be able to relate to it , and find it important/interesting . 
  because he did n't seem to acknowledge that randomly spouting your `` controversial '' view , is a really dickish thing to do , ect . 
  i wanted to fully explain that it 's a really stupid and annoying thing . 
  also , i was genuinely a small bit angry with him . 
  the combination of those two things can make me argue for a very long time . 
  and you get the prize for the creepiest bit of news . 
  we all did , ok ? 
  even us british had a sort of union going with them , but that does n't make it right . 
  we all did slavery , and it was still wrong . 
  but with slavery we overcame it . 
  now we must tackle the next great hurdle of our human a civil evolution , and overcome the french !, 
  we can do it if we act as one !, 
  the worst kind of association , after association with the french . 
  do you know why most people dislike joining the eu ? 
  or rather , how much the eu being anti democratic comes into it ? 
  i ca n't wait until harry becomes racist !, 
  i 'm gon na be so sad when philip dies ... fortunately i think harry is getting ready to take his place . 
  oh i did n't think there had been any recently . 
  i know that they 've been posted a lot over the months , but , well , the news changes as the months go by . 
  so i would n't say that any have been posted `` lately '' . 
  i 'd like to make a bigger habit out of making these regularly because people usually love to have them . 
  i guess that 's kind of the point to them . 
  it 's fun to discuss what the big news around europe is . 
  what do you mean by `` these '' threads ? 
  i have it in my calendar to post another one in exactly two week 's time . 
  :p that 's why i ( attempted ) to include the date . 
  is eu membership on the agenda ? 
  it 's quite complicated . 
  i 'll just say that [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_kosovo_declaration_of_independence ) is a good place to start . 
  basically it comes down to kosovo declaring independence from serbia , and serbia claiming that kosovo is still part of it . 
  most maps and things tend to portray kosovo as independent as it basically runs all its own affairs with help from the eu and un , but that 's overly simplified and a serbian would almost certainly disagree . 
  you 've got to admit , you 're starting to sound a little bit racist , or at the very least overly nationalist . 
  i mean , you 're treating a whole load of people like they 're one person . 
  as if every single kosovan has personally `` leached '' off of serbia . 
  you also imply that you need to have a founding in history to be a country and not not that people have a fundamental right to form their own country ( self determination ) . 
   does n't sound fair . 
  well , neither is it forcing them to be part of serbia . 
  anyway , i do n't really want to get into an argument about whether kosovo should or should n't be a country . 
  personally i 'm undecided . 
  i just felt that your anti kosovo arguments were pretty stupid and immoral . 
  feel free to reply , but i 'm ending it here as i really do n't care much about kosovo . 
  what i do care about is people being a dick for no good reason . 
  what would be the point of an eyp subbreddit ? 
  eupolitics is already a dust bowl and i doubt the eyp does nearly enough to keep a subbreddit alive . 
  me and my school team have progressed to the national stages of the ukeyp . 
  from some one who 's experienced it , i 'd like to say that so far there has been very little propaganda . 
  we 're supposed to debate european issues only , but that 's it . 
  the judges do n't force you any one to be pro european , and they never said anything pro european either . 
  it 's definitely about promoting a european identity , but it 's not really pro eu . 
  all it does is make you think about thinks on a european level , instead of a national level . 
   as far as i 'm concerned this is what our continent has come to and fought for , and still fighting for it-everyone having the right to speak their mind . 
  you 're not wrong , and i think you have every right to tell people what you think . 
  i 'm not saying you do n't have a right to speak . 
  i just also think you 're being a dick about it . 
  i do n't know why you 're making this about rights . 
  it has nothing to do about rights , and everything to do with what is the right thing to do , or to say and more specific what not to say . 
   yes i do feel the need to point things out . 
  why ? 
  what possible benefit is there ? 
  the reason i 'm doing this is because i hope you 'll stop pointlessly making people irritated . 
  that 's how i justify being a dick . 
  and yes , i fully acknowledge i 'm being a dick here . 
  at least i have a clear goal in site which is to stop people pointlessly trying to tell other people they 're wrong . 
  even though they know that no one cares ; and even though they know that they 'll convince no one ; and even though they know they 're putting up a shitty as hell argument . 
  the only argument you put forward was `` kosovo is n't a real country '' . 
  you did n't back it up or anything . 
  you just said it . 
  like a mindless sheep feeling the need to be heard . 
  do you really feel the need to pointlessly remind people that you disagree with their point of view , even when you 're not sure what they believe ? 
  i 'm guessing that the level of irritating you feel right now is pretty similar to how most people feel when you pointlessly tell people you disagree with them . 
  it 's annoying , is n't it ? 
  he did n't even imply that kosovo was a real country . 
  he just said he was in the region of kosovo . 
  kosovo is at the very least a region . 
  just because i say that my region is yorkshire or scotland , does n't mean i think either is an independent country . 
  ** and even it did ** , it does n't make it a decent thing to do to then throw it in some one 's face that it is n't a real country . 
  let 's say i 'm bisexual . 
  let 's say that i casually mention to you that i 'm bisexual , does that make it ok , for any time i happen to mention * or even imply * it that it 's ok for you to say `` oh btw , being gay is a sinn '' or something ? 
  it would n't . 
  this the same is true even if you 're `` correct '' about something . 
  a religious example is much better . 
  two people of different beliefs are at a dinner party . 
  one casually mentions that they went to church/mosque ( which obviously means they 're religious ) , so the second person steps in and says '' ** i btw i hope you know you 're wrong ** '' . 
  it 's just not really polite . 
  every one knows that people hold a variety of views on the issue . 
  you had nothing by just stating your opinion , which is an opinion that other people have stated many times before . 
  sorry to use a meme , but it 's just so [ appropriate ] ( http://i.qkme.me/36fat4.jpg ) . 
  also , the this saying comes to mind : `` it 's not what you said , it 's how [ / where ] you said it '' you 're not an asshole for having that view . 
  you 're an asshole for feeling the need to randomly throw it at someone . 
  it 's like those atheist fundamentalists who feel the need to tell christians they 're wrong at every possible opportunity . 
  edit : i 'd also like to point out that you made it very personal `` in other news , ** you 're ** not a real country . '', 
  for extra dickishness points . 
  estonia is of havings few problems . 
  esti can back into being glorious progressive paradise now .
