  africa is probably more diverse than the americas * but * i think it likes a clear way to be divided up to make it more manageable . 
  i mean there * are * ways to divide it up , but they 're not that helpful , even if you start breaking it down by country . 
  where as with america ( both ) there 's a clear division either at the panama canal or the us-mexico border . 
  with asia i 'm on the fence . 
  there are ways to divide it up ( i 'm rather fond of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_geoscheme_for_asia ) way ) but i 'm not quite sure it 's good enough : /, 
  i wish the continents section had been broken down a bit more . 
  at least into latin and anglo america . 
  i mean , the two are hardly homogeneous . 
  estonia makes us all jealous . 
  even the scandinavian utopia . 
  ( [ also , i 'm just gon na leave this here ] ( http://imgur.com/r/polandball/yayfl7i ) ), 
  so our problem is basically  `` we 're not quite as dominant in the tech industry as america '' from what i understand america is definitely ahead , but we 're definitely doing well.frivilligt has mentioned a load of swedish start ups and i ca n't remember which of the big names come from britain , i remember them being a decent number ( [ daily mail online ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16746785 ) most read * online * newspaper ** in the world ** ) . 
  add together all the european start ups and we 're definitely comparable to america . 
  and that means we 're comparable to first place . 
  not a bad place to be , you can admit . 
  the only problem i can see is that a lot of the companies which look like they 're going to get big get bought out by the already existing players like google , facebook , ect . 
  this is always going to happen when there is a pre-established big boys crowd . 
  all we need to do is get one or two big players who can easily buy out smaller , new companies and who 're european . 
  then we wo n't be quite so obviously subordinate . 
  edit : also the uk is where [ arm holdings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arm_holdings ) is based , which is the company that makes the [ arm chips used in * many * products , including iphones ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_applications_of_arm_cores ) . 
  edit 2 : does [ virgin galactic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virgin_galactic ) count as being a tech company ? 
  it 's parent company is [ virgin group ltd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virgin_group ) based in london . 
  i 'm sure this is n't the only village they have modelled after european cities . 
  it 's going to be * very * weird if the trend continues and all the rich china neighbourhoods are just imitation european neighbourhoods . 
   why do the english and french towns get pretty architecture and we get this ? 
  well they are making a city on the style of your country . 
  that 's still better than most countries get . 
  i would n't complain . 
  most of us are n't experts on international law and i do n't know of many people who are speaking out about it . 
  additionally , this publication on the face of it does not seem any more trust-able than any other publication . 
  there are other newspapers , magazines ect which at least used to claim that the sinking was illegal . 
  i 'm not going to take this any further . 
  all i 'm going to leave this with is that just because it 's written in a newspaper does n't make it true and it definitely does n't stop it being controversial . 
  the only thing that stops things being controversial is when most of us agree on it . 
  additionally , most of us agreeing on something does n't make it `` true '' , but what i am talking about is not the truth , it 's controversy . 
  i really do n't give a shit either way . 
  i have no opinion . 
  my only issue us what constitutes controversy and what does n't . 
  people constitute controversy , not the truth . 
  seeing as no one can say what is ultimately the truth , the best we can do is by all agreeing on something . 
  the belgrano incident remains controversial . 
  i 'll repeat . 
  i do not care or have any opinion on whether it was or was not legal . 
  all i am saying is that there are a lot of people from either faction and thus it is a controversial issue . 
  and i 'm done . 
  probably one of the more proud moments in post war british history . 
  proving that britain can still beat large country on their own doorstep , on literally the other side of the planet . 
  i guess , but from my point of view it seems equal numbers of people are of one mind and equal numbers of the other . 
  if one man disagrees with a million people , i would n't say it 's controversial . 
  but if a thousand people disagree with another thousand people , i 'd say it 's controversial and that 's how it looks from my perspective . 
  the nation is divided on whether the sinking was legal or not . 
  truth is not a democracy , but controversy is ( at least in a small way ) . 
  anyway , i left my original statement saying that it was ambiguous as to whether it was right or not . 
  it 's undetermined . 
  we do n't know for certain . 
  and if we do n't know for certain then we do n't know . 
  it 's ambiguous . 
  we ca n't get enough people to all agree on one narrative of events . 
  it 's a controversial and ambiguous issue . 
  agreed , but you were some what less entitled . 
  if i was alive when she was pm , then you know i have some knowledge of her reign , but if i was n't then you ca n't be sure . 
  additionally , those who lived through it are some what entitled due to having actually felt the effects of her terms in office and because they 've had the information about her told to them for the 11/12/13 ? 
  years she was in office . 
  i can have an open , and i do , but i think my opinion is subordinate to those that lived through it . 
  wow , 50/50 split ( almost ) on your karma . 
  just for that statement . 
  thatcher is pretty divisive . 
  that 's partly what people did n't like about her . 
  she was strong , strong to the point of being called iron fisted and * the * iron lady ( not * an * iron lady , * the * iron lady ) . 
  she had almost complete control of her party up till he very last day . 
  the problem with that was it meant there was almost nothing holding her back , as there normally would be . 
  that 's part of why people do n't like her . 
  perhaps that 's the case , but those that think the sinking of the belgrano was illegal/immoral must have found some argument to stand on , even if it 's just a vehicle for poking thatcher . 
  i 'm completely unaware of the specifics . 
  all i know is that a lot of people think the sinking was illegal and a lot of people think it was legal and a lot of people are in the middle , not really paying attention . 
  if i change it to `` sunk the belgrano completely legally '' loads of people will come from the woodwork and spout the opposite point of view almost as convincingly as you . 
  and yet there are people who will disagree with you on that . 
  the fact that people disagree on this make it at the very least controversial . 
  i 've heard convincing arguments from both sides in passing ( but never really stopped and listened ) so i 'm just going to leave it as is . 
  i guess she does have the same status as diana then . 
   `` she will not have a state funeral but will be accorded the same status as princess diana and the queen mother . '', 
  [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22067155 ) i 'm uncertain what they mean about * status * . 
  that could mean almost anything . 
  does this mean i ca n't say how stalin and hitler were evil little pigs ? 
  i love calling them evil little [ pigs ] ( http://th07.deviantart.net/fs42/150/i/2009/079/7/d/hitler_pig_bank_by_thesmokeking.jpg ) :(, 
  she was a prime minister from 23 years ago . 
  i 'd guess that at least half of us ( in this sub ) do n't remember or were n't alive when she came to office . 
  so people like me are n't really entitled to an opinion the same way older folks are . 
  but from what i understand , you might want to avoid getting a wide range of british people to talk about her . 
  she 's divisive to say the least . 
  for instance , she 's ranked as the most hated * and * most loved post war prime minister . 
  notable achievements ( good and bad ) include , but are not limited to * decisive victory in the falklands war * some ambiguity as to the sinking of an argentine ship in the falklands war * the mass privatisation of british industry * crushing trade unions * domination of the core executive . 
  * winning three consecutive elections and being pm for over a decade * first woman pm ( also , first woman pm to die ) * edit : poll tax that 's some of the more famous stuff , but i 'm sure people will chime in and mention * a lot * more . 
  *** left wing is best wing !, 
  i do n't think i 've heard anything about the pirate party before , besides * maybe * a couple of headlines which i skimmed over . 
  i 'll have to look into them before the european and westminster elections . 
  the experimentation with direct democracy sounds interesting and worth having some one pushing for . 
  yeah , i 'll definitely research them a little . 
  first step to overcoming a problem is admitting you have one . 
  hopefully the heads of the commission and parliament in brussels will catch wind of this , or at least those who inherit their offices will .
