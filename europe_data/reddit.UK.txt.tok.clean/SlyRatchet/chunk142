  i 'm sure we can come to some * arrangement * . 
  a european republic ? 
  why ca n't we have a european kingdom ? 
  queen elizabeth for queen of europe !, 
  any one ? 
  come on , she 'd make a good queen of europe , right ? 
  i had no idea this video existed . 
  oh it strokes my regional ego excellently ^ _ ^ thank you, 
  i live in [ sheffield ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sheffield ) which is has a very dense middle class population ( and the most green spaces of any city in england , i might add ) . 
  i can say i 've seldom ever noticed an add asking me to * put money in * , however i 've seen a billion on billboards and the tv and internet for things like wonga.com which is one of the most shitty financial things ever . 
  it gets you to borrow small amounts of money , for a small amount of time and then pay the money back at ridiculous rates . 
  i 'll try and count next time i go for a long travel , 
  if you had an american flag next to your name you 'd be receiving so much hate right now . 
  to be honest , i do n't think klingon or dothraki is work learning . 
  they 're nice and i can see why some people might learn them , but i would say that for the overwhelming majority of us those languages are a wast of time . 
  if that makes sense . 
  i hope it catches on  spread the kipperss !, 
  we keep sending obstructionist politicians like thatcher and kippers ( ukipers ) to the eu , who would rather break the entire thing than work in any way whatsoever to making the thing they hate better . 
  also , freedom from europe and stuff . 
  a lot of people want to scrap the human rights act and we ca n't do that in the eu , so that 's one good reason . 
  not my reason , but if i had to give one that 'd be the one to pick because most britons agree it 's a problem . 
  sort of . 
  edit : the reason i mention the hra/echr is because the eu does n't allow us to remove the act . 
  i know full well that the echr is part of the european council , but all members of the european union must integrate that echr into their law . 
  so the eu is stopping us from scrapping the act . 
  the only correct answer  not yet !, 
  but , think about poor lichtenstein . 
  if you get a coastline , then lichtenstein will no longer be one of the only double land locked countries in the world !, 
  bosnian and herzegovina has enough coastline ... 
  [ see ?

  and a fair junk of your country is run by the british government as an overseas territory . 
  yeah , i feel bad for cyprus :(, 
  i remember there being some sort of swedish colony/territory in the caribbean . 
  it was the butt of some joke because the island used to belong to scotland ( or someone ) and they were literally so bad at running colonies , that * sweden * took over their colony . 
  glorious empire of sweden . 
  you called ? 
  - * some one who does n't understand the difference *, 
  not going to help you as the burgers will probably go cold midway over the atlantic , but if you could just bring an entire branch of wendy 's or carl 's jr , i 'd appreciate it . 
  all the actually good fast food places stayed in america and we got the cheapo stuff like mcdonald 's . 
  i got this as a christmas present once , in the uk . 
  interestingly , iirc it 's vegetarian . 
  now all we need to do is cut to a pre-recorded set , and show it being blown up in nuclear war or some thing . 
  went to amsterdam once . 
  we walked passed a couple of people two streets away from our hostel . 
  as we walked passed the two split up , and then the guy aggressively whispered something in dutch and we just sort of looked , then both parties sort of shuffled away . 
  i 'm still not sure what he said , but we 're all under the impression he was whisper `` crack , crack , crack '' in dutch . 
  ( crack as in the drug , obviously ) . 
  aside from that it was a pretty normal and very safe holiday , but i 've only been * approached * by a drug 's person once before . 
   they abolished freedom of press define `` freedom of the press '' and its polar opposite `` an abolished free press '' . 
  that is a very ambiguous term . 
  i 'm not a hungarian and i 'm very ignorant of this situation , but i want to disagree with you on point three . 
   if you get to change the constitution or pass any law you want , then that 's not a democracy . 
  constitutions in all nations are prone to change . 
  the us can easily change its constitution and has done over 20 times . 
  in the uk we do n't have a codified constitution ( as in it is * not * written in * one * , single document ) . 
  the constitution is vested in various laws and acts . 
  the parliament of the day can change any one of these acts , whenever it pleases , with a simple majority . 
  in the us it is slightly more difficult as you need a 2/3 or 3/4 majority ( super majority ) to amend the constitution . 
  my point is that being able to change the constitution has no bearing on how democratic a country is . 
  constitutions are not integral parts of democracy , as the uk demonstrates . 
  so a state 's ability to change its constitution is just a part of its democratic process . 
  you 're not `` undemocratic '' for having a constitution which can be easily changed . 
  if anything , you 're more democratic because constitutions often go against the will of the citizens of the day , but that 's a more controversial issue . 
  sticking more throughly to what you wrote :  the constinutional court can give opinions - but not being able to reject constitutional laws the supreme court being able to reject a constitution amendment would sounds * extremely * undemocratic to me . 
  judges are usually unelected and merely appointed by some previous government , with the people of a nation having no say . 
  judges are hard to impeach and very rarely reflect public opinion ( they tend to value property over individual liberty ) . 
  so yeah , i * really * disagree with point number three . 
  from what i know of the situation ( which is next to nothing ) and from what you two have said , it sounds like the courts are working like courts are supposed to . 
  a check and balance on government , but still , ultimately , subordinate to the government through the democratic process . 
  sure , your judiciary is not perfect . 
  i do n't know a lot about your judiciary , but i can tell you it is not perfect because * no judiciary is perfect * just like * no government is ever perfect * . 
  i 'm conflicted on who to believe between the two of you now . 
  is this an april fools are something ? 
  it sounds like hitler 's rise to power what with winning national elections , and then proceeding to entirely destroy the democratic system . 
  this ca n't be serious , can it ? 
  i came to the comments in the hope some one would explain what was going on :( no luck so far . 
  last time i checked , we were european too !, 
  do n't listen to farage !, 
  as it only has like 15,000 people it 's hardly going to be a hotbed for crime . 
  most european capitals have * at least * 1 million inhabitants and the top ones like paris and london have over 10 million inhabitants . 
  ( [ vaguely helpful wikipedia link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/largest_cities_and_metropolitan_areas_in_the_european_union,_by_eurostat ) ) . 
  by the time you get to the bottom you 're mostly on cities of little importance ( with some exceptions ) , and yet they 're still 25 times bigger than nuuk . 
  i do n't have any direct info for crime , apart from an interesting thing on their rehabilitation policy , but from things i vaguely remember reading in the past , it sounded very safe especially for a european capital . 
  [ nuuk ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/assets/images/2009/06/22/090622114329_090622_witn_greenland_226x152.jpg ) it 's technically , sort of part of a european country . 
  so it 's sort of european . 
  95 % of londoners and british citizens , yes . 
  but the 5 % of white chavs who 'll kick in a shop window at the first opportunity ? 
  different story . 
  it only takes a tiny minority to screw everything up . 
   * obligatory comment about how children are n't very safe in the vatican *, 
  us europeans are pretty good at having random territory around the world . 
  ( for any one that 's interested ) [ dutch caribbean ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/dutch_caribbean_location_map.svg ) [ british overseas territories ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/british_overseas.png ) [ french overseas departments * and territories * ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/outre-mer_en.png ) [ spain and portugal 's atlantic islands ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/madeira_location_%28pt_and_eu%29.jpg ) [ and demark 's autonomous regions of the faroe islands and greenland ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/kingdom_of_denmark_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/255px-kingdom_of_denmark_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png ), 
  i think i 'm seeing a pattern here ... spain ^ spain ^ ( spain ) ^ ^ ( spain ) ^ ^ ( spain ) ^ ^ ( spain ), 
  there 's no territorial dispute there . 
  just spain being annoyed/annoying . 
  personally i 'm conflicted about the balkans situation . 
  in cyprus i just see the turkish north as an occupation rather than a native population . 
  i would like to support kosovo as being an independent state in europe , but i fear this is leading to the former yugoslavia area breaking down and down into increasingly small and ungovernable states . 
  imagine if that whole region was broken down into hundreds of countries the size of luxembourg or liechtenstein , all of whom hated each other and all of whom were less than friendly with each other .
