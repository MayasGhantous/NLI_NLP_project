  additionally , the states in the usa accept that missouri will get a net benefit from government spending because a ) that 's the status quo , which it is not ( yet ) in europe and b ) because it is still done in a federal way , ie only a very small and quite acceptable fraction of one state 's wealth will be distributed to other ( poorer ) states . 
  if texans felt the federal government was taking more than a * federal * government should , they would be displeased . 
  the texans would also be displeased because this would be changing the status quo . 
  so overall , i do n't see the `` permanent bailout '' mentality as a permanent problem . 
  it is a partial problem to the eu and its integrity at the moment due to several factors which amplify the `` permanent bailout '' mentality . 
  in the long run , this wont be a serious problem in the same way that it is not a problem in the us or uk or any other sovereign state because it will eventually become the status quo and we will eventually all ( mostly ) accept the benefit of it . 
  most of the eu is in this type of a * transfer * union . 
  it 's called the eurozone . 
  i think it is a danger , but one that can be easily overcome if the crisis is handled properly . 
   in the us , richer states `` give money '' ( indirectly ) to poorer states , and the same thing happens in all countries ... nobody cares , but when it 's about helping greece , then your average eu citizen is going to complain because it 's bloody foreigners . 
  rich ( and generally southern ) british people love to complain about their tax being taken from them forcefully and then redistributed to those bloody poor people . 
  the problem you mentioned is in no way specific to the eu . 
  it 's a little more pronounced than the uk or usa , but it 's fundamentally the same problem and not really that much of a larger problem from the point of view of citizens . 
  also , city states like singapore are build on trade . 
  if some where like london was a city state , it 'd be doing pretty badly after the financial crisis as being purely dependent on trade always is . 
  though i do like the idea of federal cities over seen by the eu .

  holy mother , how come there are so many comments downvoted to being minimised ? 
  they make like half of the initial comments . 
  i 'm still waiting to see some one from lichtenstein . 
  come on , there must be some one ? 
  also , i think i 'm yet to see a macedonian a kosovan , malteian ( ok , yeah i do n't know the demonyms ) . 
  not that i 'm viewing nationalities as a sort of pokemon style '' ` got ta ' catch 'em all '' typed thing . 
  too be honest i actually thought he handled it quite well . 
  he 's acting a bit out of his normal character , but it sort of made it look like he can be serious . 
  he can take an issue very seriously without a lot of very fast talking and fumbling and i have n't really seen that side of him much before . 
  but maybe i 'm just being oblivious to london politics . 
  ah , you have a point . 
  i should have added : ( southern english/american tv ` british ' accent ), 
  perhaps slightly fraudulent data , given what happened to the statistics the eu was given before greece 's entrance . 
   race to build a road across the atlantic ocean . 
  wait , what now ? 
  also accents . 
  from what i hear it goes some thing like american < < < ( every other accents in the world ) < french < canadian < british < australian < irish it 's a nice club up there at the top ( with very little between them ) , but ireland does just that edge to get into the next level of hdi ;p, 
  well , that 's a , umm , greece ... 
  i always found it interesting that turkish was an asian language and thus used an asian style alphabet/script but then the writing system was changed to the latin form . 
  i just find that so odd that it would be changed . 
   despite the country 's small size , there exist lots of dialects which result in the need for subtitles on news programmes when certain people talk . 
  i wish subtitling was more common for thick accents . 
  news channels obviously end up interviewing huge numbers of people with hugely varied accents . 
  given that english is spoken as a national language in all six ( sorry antarctica ) continents , the accents get hugely varied and 24 hour newscasts feel that it 'd be insulting to subtitle the interviewees , despite them being very hard to understand . 
  i 'm not very good at understanding accents , especially if i do n't have a lot of exposure , but i ca n't be the only one . 
  even thick uk accents are hard to understand . 
  i here by declare , that from hence forth all speech spoken in english should be subtitled for the benefit of listeners !, 
  whilst i agree that the written and spoken forms of english are extremely different i do n't strictly speaking see this as a bad thing . 
  it makes it harder to learn for those who learn to speak first and then to write . 
  however , it allows for a deeper understanding of what 's been written . 
  english words are often made up of lots of little chunks : suffixes , prefixes and usually some latin , greek or french in the middle . 
  whilst our pronunciation of the prefix , middle and suffix will not reflect spelling , it does allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the meaning which might be lost if the language was written purely phonetically . 
  additionally , if we were to write purely in phonetic terms , it means that the written form would change at a near constant speed . 
  this is how language works . 
  having a standardised spelling system ensures that any english speaker can always be understand , so long as they are using the same dialect ( note : dialect = / = accent ) . 
  when i speak i can pronounce these words in all manner of ways , but when they are spelled they are spelled one way . 
  that one way will be universally understood . 
  if you speak , then you will not be universally understood . 
  we 've had a standardised spelling system for some thing like 300 hundred years . 
  these sorts of problems are bound to arise and it 's amazing that it 's only as bad as it is . 
  but even in the next 300 years , i 'm not sure i 'd change it . 
  anyway , that 's my double pronged , poorly articulated defence of the english writing system . 
   seeing how all other large empires have failed at some point or in some way or the other i 'd just like to point some thing out from a historical perspective . 
  nothing ever lasts forever . 
  not even the continents will last , nor will the earth . 
  just because some thing will at some point end does not mean it is a bad club to join . 
  additionally , no nation state ( like norway or america ) has lasted forever and i doubt one will . 
  does this mean that norway is a bad country ? 
  obviously not . 
  i hope you see my point . 
  additionally i 'd like to point out that the eu is in absolutely no way an empire . 
  ( extract from the new oxford american dictionary )  1 an extensive group of states or countries under ** a single ** supreme authority , formerly esp . 
  an emperor or empress empire ( adj. ), 
  : [ in names ] the roman empire . 
   * a government in which the head of state is an emperor or empress . 
  * a large commercial organization owned or controlled by ** one ** person or group : her business empire grew . 
  * an extensive operation or sphere of activity controlled by ** one ** person or group : the kitchen had once been the ladies ' empire . 
  * ** supreme political power ** over several countries when exercised by a ** single ** authority : he encouraged the greeks in their dream of empire in asia minor . 
  * ( archaic ) ** absolute ** control over a person or group . 
  from this we can see that at least one but ideally both the attributes of a single body having control over the periphery * or * a governing body having * supreme * control over the periphery . 
  in the eu sovereignty and power is shared between the central body of the eu and the member states , with the member states holding absolute sovereignty in that they can leave at any time . 
  additionally the eu can only legislate on certain areas . 
  so the eu does not match the criteria of an empire , though if you * really * want to try and distort the definition of the word , you could probably wedge the eu into it , if you really were trying very hard and cutting a lot of corners . 
  but the eu does not easily fit because it has neither absolute power , nor is it vested in a single body as the member states make up a powerful part of the eu . 
  is n't this true of just about every continent and/or political organisation and/or set of sovereign states ? 
  your criticisms really so seem quite unfounded . 
  have you actually been to europe and if so , how many different parts ? 
  i 'm sure you 're aware that europe 's actually quite big and extremely varied . 
  i know you 're probably just a troll and everything , but is there any reason you have for thinking this ? 
  ni stayed in the uk through democratic process . 
  at the point in time which the republic of ireland left the union we were becoming committed to the ideas of democracy , at least in respect to those which we saw as culturally similar and not inferior . 
  so the people of northern ireland demanded to be part of the union whilst the republic demanded it not be . 
  we could not have kept ireland in if we had wanted to and we could not have kicked ni out even if we had wanted to . 
  the decision was never any one but the people of ni and the republic of ireland . 
  though seeing as you 're for it , maybe we should consider kicking wales out , 
  i 'm going to do as the last person did and just agree to disagree . 
  i 've made my points and do n't think either of us has anything that will unseat the other , at least in terms the other 's eyes . 
  are you really giving them a voice if their voice is ignored ? 
  i do n't see anything being achieved by asking them this question . 
  you ca n't let people vote on whether 5 million people should be revoked of their citizenship . 
  that decision rests with the people who are effected and only those people . 
  if you 're not suggesting that we let the english and co vote in that referendum then what are you suggesting ?
