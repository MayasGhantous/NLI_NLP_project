  the only alternative i can see to that immoral action is that england and co simply get asked their opinion with no weight attached to what they say which will not only be a pointless wast of money but also be of no use any way because turnout will be so low . 
   you frightened ? 
  why would i be ? 
  what kind of a question is that ? 
  well the torygraph says [ # 80 million ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/av-referendum/8438349/alternative-vote-referendum-will-cost-80-million.html ) skynews says [ # 75 million ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1028003/alternative-vote-referendum-cost-75m ) now some one will make the argument that # 80 million is insignificant in the grand scheme of things and whilst it is a ** relatively ** small amount , it is still better spent on other things which will actually benefit people . 
  would you rather spend # 80 million on a * near pointless * referendum or on cancer research or infrastructure grants or building social housing or pretty much anything . 
  do you know how expensive it is to have referendums ? 
  do you know how expensive it would be to instead of asking the 5 million scots what they thing , to ask the 50 million english what they think ? 
  it 's important that we have information , but in terms of cost verses reward , this is a bit of a bad move . 
  it would mean the english ( and co ) would get their voices heard , but they 'd be heard and then promptly ignored . 
  ignored after spending millions of pounds to find out what they think . 
  it 's also immoral !, 
  i 'm not sure separatist sentiment can be seen as a bad thing or a `` backfire '' , definitely not from alex salmond and the scottish national party 's point of view . 
  but yes , it could certainly do that , however it could also work in the opposite direction . 
  scotland could fail miserably at independence either at the polls or it could possibly become independent and turn out to be awful , thus increasing conservatism in the uk and europe . 
  as for the uk 's purpose i 'd argue that the uk has the same objective of any state , that it is simply there to fulfil the wishes of its people . 
  that object can never really be fulfilled as people will always have wishes , however scotland leaving or even the full dismantlement of the united kingdom would not mean the uk failed at its mission , but simply that there are better means for its mission to be achieved . 
  you raise , odd questions . 
   will this situation backfire ? 
  if so , does that mean that the uk served it 's purpose ? 
  define backfire and define the uk 's purpose ? 
  i was n't aware the uk 's purpose could ever be ` fulfilled ' . 
  it 's a continual process . 
  and backfire is a highly subjective matter . 
  barnet formula . 
  the scots get more money per head than people in england . 
  so when the independence referendum became big news and people started reading about it , a lot of english people found out that they were effectively subsidising the scottish and immediately became grumpy . 
  because of this , support for * scottish * independence is higher * in england * than it is * in scotland * . 
  edit : i forget to mention that there is some ambiguity as to how much scotland contributes to the uk national budget , with some estimates saying that scotland actually contributes more as a whole ** however ** , most reports i 've read claim this is probably not the case , at least 90 % of the time . 
  basically , yes . 
  weirdo :p, 
  whilst i like that a major part of the eu is criticising another part of the eu for being too transparent , i 'd like the entirety of the eu ( including the parliament ) to acknowledge that they * all * need to become more transparent . 
  you have a point . 
  intellect or object reasoning abilities should n't be a cut off point . 
  i 'd need to read up more on what burdens of life people from the ages of 16 to 18 actually have . 
  nothing for me has really changes from when i was 15 apart from that legally i had to sign a document for sixth form and that i had to be talked to instead of just my parents . 
  perhaps as i get older i 'll notice the line between adult and child is even more irrelevant than it already appears to be . 
  will report back in a decade 's time !, 
  or perhaps you over estimate . 
  source : i 'm seventeen and in a sixth form . 
  whilst i might actually agree with a fare amount of what my peers think , i hugely disagree with why they believe . 
  ie , a lot of them easily persuaded by rhetoric . 
  maybe my sixth form is n't filled with exceptionally good thinkers , ( outside the a-level philosophy lot ) but i 'd be hesitant of granting every one in my sixth form the ability to vote . 
  and i get even more uncertain when i look at the top of year 11 . 
  i remember watching a little thing about this on a 24 hours new channel when it happened . 
  but that was once , a long time ago and i was n't paying much attention so this might turn out to be very wrong . 
  parliamentary elections had just taken place in ukraine and this was their first session . 
  ukrainians normally start their parliaments this way because , i do n't know , it was n't very well explained . 
  so these two mps ( i believe they were father and son ) had campaigned for one party and been voted in but after they were elected they they switched from one party to another . 
  this apparently pissed off the entire ukrainian parliament and thus broke out into a huge fight , as per usual . 
  also , there 's some guy who 's chilling off to one side watching what 's going on who 's apparently an ex-boxer turned politician which the cameras were following in case he got involved and beat the crap out of every one . 
  that 's what i remember from the news report a few years ago anyway . 
  it was quite funny . 
  let 's not let this place turn into / r/worldnews guys . 
  one post about india rape of that swiss woman was alright , but no one really wants daily updates on whether a european was raped in india today . 
  i bet you this is because he likes lesbian porn , and who can blame him ? 
  i 'd rather the government not be trying to tell me how long i can go partying for ... 
  i like number two a lot from a uk perspective . 
  briton here , whilst we certainly have a history of being assholes , no one in europe or even the world is going to call us out on it . 
  german politicians still like to reference how amazing britain is because we helped defeat the nazis 70 years ago . 
  so , every one seems to think we 're alright , even if we do n't , i guess . 
  more direct democracy . 
  eu law being more visible and be seen to distance itself from bureaucracy . 
  that he 'll become a professional dinning guest . 
  that 's what william hague did after he lost the general election and thus ceased to be head of the british conservative party . 
  he got paid to make speeches at dinner parties and the like . 
  edit : and he wrote a book or some thing . 
  you get the picture . 
  that america is n't extremely far away . 
  the point was poorly illustrated by saying that you can fly across the atlantic in less time than it would take to drive across europe . 
  i 'm aware they 're different modes of transportation , but it vaguely illustrated the point that they 're are comparable differences . 
  the real point here is that the argument that going to america is bad based on distance is silly , but i made that point very poorly . 
  what did i do ? 
  :( and why am i anti europe ? 
  the usa being a former british colony has very little to do with it . 
  it probably makes the relationship more strained that it otherwise would be , at least a few centuries ago . 
  imo there 's these four reasons . 
  * language . 
  need i say more ? 
  * the trade : this is spured on by the cultural similarities and ability for our products to be sold in both markets * wwi and wwii : the uk was a much more powerful nation then and saw the us as an equal rather than superior . 
  the usa did likewise . 
  they could both depend on each other in a way they could n't with other european nations , such as france as it had a continuity issue . 
  * attached to the above reason is that foreign policy was very similar . 
  it was isolationist for a long time . 
  respect was built upon that idea and so was a sense of understand , at least for the diplomats who run both countries . 
  ultimately i think the us-uk ` special relationship ' is going to diminish . 
  i think the us only sees us as special so long as we 're a relatively big nation willing to agree with them , which we are n't always . 
  they 've liked us under the bush administration as blair was willing to support america fully in iraq and afghanistan , but now we both have more pacifists leaders we have lesser need to rely on each other . 
  additionally the uk and even usa are going to continue to become less and less economically significant and thus will have to make new trade deals , and alliances which will lessen our interdependence , or rather british dependence on america . 
  so in the end we 'll be left with the cultural similarity , the language and maybe foreign policy , but that 's not really going to be a special relationship , especially when you consider that more and more nations are going to have english as an official language . 
  virtually every one in scandinavia and the netherlands speaks english these days and that number is only going to grow . 
  the us and uk will always be close allies ( probably ) but i don ; t think we 'll be special allies . 
  i think that we 'll get a lot of special allies and thus the importance of each other to each other will be diminished because of so many new relationships . 
  shit ... 
  sorry , dyslexic moment . 
  a and b are awfully close in the alphabet and , yeah . 
  i meant b , but it just sort of slipped . 
  i think i was trying to remember the name of cefr and kept trying to remember what the `` c '' in `` common '' was for and well , hit the wrong key . 
  will fix . 
  because it 's about a swiss and thus reminding us that india is dangerous not just to locals but also to tourists and potential tourists like ourselves and are friends .
