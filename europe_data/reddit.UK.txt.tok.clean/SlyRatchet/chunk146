  it 's not the most european thing obviously , but it 's some thing that 's interesting . 
  i 'd like to remind that the deleted comments were discussing killing the indian population so that there 'd be less problems . 
  that is a little bit hitler-esk what with the nazi 's lebensraum plan . 
  aside from that details of what they were saying , the words being exchanged sort of conveyed a disregard for the lives of indians . 
  that 's why it was a little hitlery . 
  not super hitlery , but it was getting there . 
  the fact those comments were deleted ( by the moderators ) goes some to explaining that . 
  well the main thing to keep in mind is that in the uk system we have a fusion of the executive and the legislature . 
  in most people 's minds these two things are intrinsically separate because that 's how it is in the us . 
  in the us the president is not a member of the legislature . 
  i.e the president does not sit in house of representatives or the senate . 
  in the uk , the head of government ( note , not head of state . 
  that title is the queen 's ) which is the prime minister does sit in the legislature known which in the uk is parliament . 
  parliament in the uk has two houses . 
  the house of lords which is full of politicians ** appointed ** by the pm . 
  the house of lords is largely irrelevant as the other house of parliament can overrule the lords ( part of the parliament act ) . 
  the lower , but more powerful , house is the house of commons . 
  the pm is a member of this house . 
  for intents and purposes let 's imagine that the house of commons is exactly the same as the house of representatives ( i 'm assuming every one knows how that works , vaguely ) . 
  every member of parliament ( mp ) who sits in the house of commons is elected by a constituency based on a plurality vote ( whoever gets the most votes in that constituency gets to be its mp , note , plurality = / = majority ) . 
  anyway there are 600 constituencies in the uk which means we have 600 mps . 
  mps are nearly always members of a political party and that political party has a whip which will try to force all party members in the commons to vote a particular way . 
  after a general election one party usually ( but not always ) has a majority . 
  if one party has a majority they all vote on who should be the next prime minister . 
  if one mp gets over 300 ( out of 600 mps ) of mps to say he should be pm the queen will invite this mp ( let 's call him david ) to form a government . 
  david is now the prime minister and in charge of the executive branch of government . 
  he will proceed to appoint ministers to run various departments & ministries of government . 
  finn that covers how the pm is elected and also gestures vaguely at some other things . 
  sorry that it 's really dense reading . 
  i was n't exactly sure how to explain it all so i just kind of put it all out there . 
  i 'd love to get some questions if you have any as i could probably explain slightly better through that medium . 
  if not , i hope this helps at least a bit . 
  it 's a very interesting , old and eccentric system . 
   now my question , please where in your mind does hitler come into this ? 
  please tell me . 
  the bit where the first commenter ( who 's now been deleted ) said that we should napalm them and you sort of agreed . 
  there was a lot of truth in what you and the other poster were saying , but the way you view the people and the ( probably sarcastic ) solutions you were coming up with were kind of hitlery . 
  part of the reason people get very scared by the growth of the human population is because people see each of these 7,000,000,000 ( hope i got that right ) people who are alive and the ones who will be alive soon , as a problem , as a mouth that needs to be fed . 
  this is a bad way of looking at population growth . 
  a better way of looking at population growth is to think of that seven billion and realise that each one of those numbers is a person who will contribute to the world ( probably ) and find ways to feed himself . 
  all humans need to do to survive is ( to sound a bit like a hippy ) harness the power of ourselves . 
  india will be the most populous country on the planet . 
  that 's my view on the matter and i know it wont be that simple . 
  however , it is much more positive and has just about as much logic . 
   how does your country work ? 
  i 'm an as-level government and politics student and so far we 've been trying to learn exactly how it works for over a year , and we have another year to look forward to after the june exams . 
  which bit do you want to know about , specifically ? 
  i 'm assuming how the pm is elected/appointed , right ? 
  this sounds very depressing and all , but if half of it comes true it 'll practically be a feast of economic success compared to the last four/five years . 
  it 's vaguely positive and that 's some thing . 
  i hope that the awful stuff at the fringes of the eurozone can at least stop getting worse . 
  it looks like maybe , it 's stopping getting worse and not getting worse is one of the precursors to getting better . 
  oh i agree , but i did want to make the point that half the world away is n't exactly that far . 
  it 's far , but not inconceivably so . 
  also , when we 're talking about '' ** never ** leaving the borders of europe '' you really do want to point out that america and europe are still pretty similar and probably indistinguishable to some one who does n't have experience of either . 
  basically , america 's a decent place to go . 
  you should n't rule it out because some people in india go around raping . 
  and only a 12 hour flight away . 
  takes me much longer than that to drive to the other side of europe . 
  america 's not all that far , and even if it was i do n't know why it 's relevant . 
  thanks for keeping this in context . 
  i 'd rather they be called `` youths '' than '' those fucking immigrants '' . 
  youths is probably much more representative of the kind of people who irritated , chafe with the more `` native '' inhabitants . 
  i really dislike chavs around where i live and there just about the most home grown british thing there is . 
  i 'd take an indian restaurant over 30 minutes with a chav any day . 
  especially when you keep in mind that eu borders change . 
  they 're not a tactile concept . 
  why not go to bosnia ? 
  it 'll probably be within eu borders within a decade anyway . 
  why not go to norway ? 
  using eu borders is a really arbitrary way to go about it . 
  especially when you consider all of the great parts of the world outside europe . 
  europe 's great and everything , but there 's no tokyo in it and there 's no sahara desert , mecca , nile , or beijing and there 's grand canyon . 
  you 're really limiting yourself by sticking just to europe . 
  we 've got plenty of castles and culture and history and amazing things , but to think that we 'd be ok to limit ourselves simply to our own castles is na\u00efve . 
  america ticks all those boxes . . 
  part of the problem is no one knows who to blame . 
  every one was incompetent in the cause of the 2008 financial crash . 
  * bankers for giving out * very * risky loans * the eu/eurozone for not properly protecting the currency before hand * the leaders of government for not keeping their national debt down the list could go on , but every one is really to blame in some way because they were all negligent . 
  this leads to the problem of not knowing who to complain to or who to go to for retribution or even who should be fixing it . 
  the eu should probably be protested , but so should the banks and so should the former heads of government . 
  this is getting a little bit hitlery ... 
   would countries like netherlands or germany where english is the not primary language severely hinder my opportunity ? 
  i do n't mind learning languages , but i do n't expect to be very fluent in the given time . 
  a ) it depends on the kind of work and the kind of company . 
  from what i 've heard soft where and multi national companies tend to use english more often as the working language in their company , even if their presence in english speaking countries is relatively small . 
  but do n't bet on this being the case . 
  additionally , if you want to work in the service sector such as bars , taxi drivers , cashiers , you get the picture you 're going to * need * to know the native language to at least b1 under the [ common european framework of reference aka cefr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_european_framework_of_reference_for_languages ) b ) speaking of languages , you 'll want to head over to / r/languagelearning to ask them how much of what ever language you can learn in any given time is . 
  they 're always very helpful and usually offer reasonably good advice and plenty of resources to get good in the given time frame . 
  you 'd be amazed how good you can get if you have enough time , especially if it 's a western european language like spanish or german as opposed to an eastern slavic one like polish or russian . 
  i do n't feel well informed enough to comment on the other aspects of your post , but thought this would be useful . 
  on the whole i say `` good '' . 
  the eu is all about soft power and should n't be trying ti intervene militarily in a way similar to the usa in previous wars . 
  i 'd like us to support the rebels in some way , but adding more ammunition and weapons into the conflict does n't sound like a good idea if afghanistan in the cold war or iraq in the 1980s is anything to go by . 
  it 's important to note that maltese is an official language of the eu . 
  what the prime minister was complaining about is that they said maltese was an official language and then they do n't translate it . 
  i 'm pretty well for an official , singular working language of the eu , but i think that we should agree to have that language rather than just not translating some one mid speech . 
  the maltese were told they 'd be translated and that should be respected . 
  it 's written down in law . 
  the eu should stick by its word here .
