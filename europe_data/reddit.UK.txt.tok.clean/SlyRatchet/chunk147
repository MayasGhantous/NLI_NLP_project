  it can change it 's word through treaty change , but it should continue to allow every one to be translated until that point . 
  slight modification  there is the elected president of parliament that 's either not true or a gross over simplification . 
  elected when un-clarified usually means directly elected by the people of the state , which is radically different to how the ep president is elected . 
  he 's appointed/elected by the members of the ep . 
  i just wanted to make that distinction between appointed and elected . 
  avoid saying that he is elected because it makes it sound like the public elects him , which is n't the case . 
  i do n't have any problem with that even though i know i 'm making it sound bad . 
  it 's not intentional . 
  there 's a lot of anglocentricism in anglosaxon companies ** however ** , they do still realise that there are other non anglosaxon markets . 
  google 's first market was the us and then probably fellow english speaking countries . 
  google is used in many more than just english speaking countries now and google is very much aware of that . 
  additionally , they know the eu has far more people than the us and thus to ignore it would be ridiculous . 
  they know all of this and they 'll be working on ways to harness foreign markets like the eu better . 
  it 's not in their interests to only cater to the us and anglo-sphere . 
  they 're aware of all of this and will want to make their service better for europeans just like they want to make it better for americans and south africans and japanese and every one else . 
  thing is , we do n't know if they 're terrorists . 
  some probably are and a lot probably are n't , but we do n't know . 
  complicated issue . 
  already on it !, 
  i 'd love to get surprise eu food in the mail !, 
  one the financiers of the conservative party probably has * a lot * more influence than the queen . 
  the meetings the queen ( and prince charles ) have with government lobby government far less successfully than a medium sized pressure group , union leader , ridiculously wealthy banker/ceo , oh and not forgetting rupert murdoch . 
  the monarch 's an interesting one , but most of us agree she has very little power , though personally i acknowledge any one who meets with the pm once a week will have a little power . 
  that power is just very small . 
   and of course so much more of the political discourse now happens by people talking to each other on the internet now . 
  i think that this is over rated . 
  not * that * many people actually use the internet to make informed decisions and a large portion of those who do just go to the daily mail online anyway . 
  even here on reddit we * mostly * post links to the online versions of newspapers . 
  if you 're talking specifically about communication between individuals on the internet , we 're * definitely * in an extreme minority here . 
  last thing : keep in mind that most of the voters are older and / ** or ** unaware of its huge affect . 
  lord justice leveson comes to mind . 
  i agree with the theme of what you 're saying , but that paragraph i do n't really agree with . 
  * maybe * things will be different in a few decades , but i do mean decades and i do mean * maybe * . 
   not that i can think of anyone who i would name instead . 
  the leader of the unite labour union is the only person i can think of . 
  maybe some faceless bankers or have the treasury 's ears or one of the big money providers to the conservatives . 
  the media are bought by the people who buy the political parties . 
  the parties do n't have enough money to buy the media , and if they did there 'd be outrage because of politicians owning the media . 
  i mean , who are we ? 
  berlusconi ? 
  para \u2022 plagic is the lower body and legs being paralysed and quad \u2022 ri \u2022 plegic is paralyses of all four ( ie quad , meaning four ) limbs . 
  i 'm not explaining this to look like a precocious british twat instructing people on arbitrary uses of english . 
  i 'm genuinely wondering whether he 's quadriplegic or paraplegic and hoped you or some one would explain . 
  it really sounds interesting . 
  agreed , but whilst you can say there 's a pretty big difference , you ca n't say there is n't also a big similarity . 
  i 'm by no means saying they 're the same , but i am saying that they 're more similar than op probably realises . 
  i wanted to draw attention to how similar they are , though i accept they 're by no means the same . 
  we have so much in common :p, 
  lol cat pictures to be distributed on an hourly basis to all house holds !, 
  reddit karma to be valued along side national currency !, 
  #vote 4change, 
  there 's little chance of war . 
  it 's all fun and politics until people start dying . 
  hopefully with the falklands and iraq we 've learned that . 
  perhaps this is the appropriate thing to call , hypocrisy ? 
  you 're getting angry at people for generalising about you and your `` background '' and in tern making judgments about all left wingers . 
  that generalisation being that they generalise you , which is also possibly untrue . 
  there 's a huge amount of idiots on both sides of any political debate or allegiance or what have you . 
  there 's stupid leftists , stupid right wingers , stupid centrists , stupid europhiles and stupid eurosceptics . 
  the list could go on for eternity . 
  however , those stupid people seldom define the group ( perhaps , maybe , like one or two exceptions ^ ( ( bnp ) ^ ) ) . 
  whilst one side of a political , racial , economic , ect thing might be particularly good at having a certain kind of prejudice under its mitts , that does n't define the group . 
  i understand that 's not what you 're saying , but what you are saying really does seem to be a gross over generalisation . 
  yes , the left and the right wings are racist . 
  racism has little to do with the political spectrum . 
  otherwise we 'd call it the prejudice spectrum . 
  there 's little point trying yo determine which side is more racist than the other . 
  doing so is about as beneficial as arguing over whether whites wast more money than blacks or what ever . 
  it 's pointless , achieves nothing of any benefit and creates a ` them and us ' mentality which pets lefties against righties and blacks against whites or catholics against protestants . 
  edit : really should proof read * before * posting and not after . 
  which three foreign officials were these ? 
  i see where the idea is coming from , but it seems rather an odd thing to do . 
  instead of letting every one communicate well , it just cuts every one 's index finger off , crippling all of them . 
  additionally it seems inherently wrong to me that one should impose restrictions on who can and ca n't be an mep . 
  in the uk the only requirement is that you 're a common wealth citizen and above the age of 18 . 
  apart from that you need no qualifications and nothing in addition . 
  the only thing some one should need to be elected to represent a group of individuals is that they get elected . 
  that 's all they should have to do . 
  it 's not for us to add on top of that `` oh , but they need to know this '' . 
  we should not impose restrictions . 
  we should not say that some can be meps and some not . 
  it 's anti democratic . 
  if people want to elect a monolingual idiot , or even a monolingual genius , they should be allowed to and not have any one restrict their choice of candidate . 
  but then that means you * must * know at least one foreign language be an mep . 
  what if you 're an anti eu party like ukip who 're obstructionist and possibly unable to communicate in french or german ? 
  i do n't support ukip , but we should n't be excluding them , otherwise we 'll just be giving them even more anti democratic arguments . 
  i understood `` on the blink '' i did n't understand what he meant by `` booth '' . 
  like i said , i thought he was referring to the translators booth , but i was not sure because it was a poorly constructed sentence which had been uttered with no context to it . 
  i think we have a misunderstanding here some where . 
  i live in sheffield , yorkshire and have done my entire life . 
  violence is rarely , if ever , the solution . 
  pretty much . 
  nice talking to ya ' . 
  that is a little odd . 
  maybe that particular uni is just advertised well in cyprus ? 
  i know that 's why you tend to get english holiday resorts in places like spain . 
  all the holiday makers there are of one nationality ( with some exceptions ) and yet there 's no obvious reason why they 're all the same . 
  the answer there usually comes down to advertising , and then word of mouth added on top later . 
  well uk and us universities are basically the best in the world , so it 's not that surprising that many foreign nationals go to these places for an education . 
   not even nk is that stupid .
