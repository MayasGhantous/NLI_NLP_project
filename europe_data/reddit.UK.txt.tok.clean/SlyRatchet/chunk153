  could you link to the comments about serbian aggression ? 
  i scrolled down quite a bit on his page and did n't find it . 
  you must have gone through quite a few sections . 
  no love for [ kazakhstan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_subregion_map_un_geoschme.svg ) ? 
  you 'd be surprised how often second language speakers of english correct native english speakers around here . 
  i swear it happens more that way than the other way around . 
  berlusconi 's getting a surprising amount of votes . 
  additionally , it looks like the italians really do n't get long to cast there vote . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21574116 ) says the polls closed at 15:00 which is unusual . 
  i was under the impression that most countries polled for twelve hours so people had an entire day to do it . 
  if that 's the case in italy it 'd sure be awkward to get there . 
  wonder how it all works . 
  after some contemplation i 'd like to nominate my self in a very narcissistic and self important manner , because how else can you nominate yourself apart from narcissistically . 
  i would n't do this if i did n't feel as though i was popular in / r/europe . 
  i 'm not going to go on a tangent about how people love me , i doubt that 's the case . 
  but i 've gotten some support from a small number of members for a variety of things like recently putting sensationalisms into context . 
  asside from not being hated , which in the scheme of things is probably quite irrelevant , i seldom get angry at redditors and that shows in my post history . 
  ok , that bit of self publicising over . 
  i just thought i should make some vague motion towards my merits , at least . 
  agreed . 
  that 's one of the reasons i 'm on the fence about nominating myself . 
  the other being nominating yourself is embarrassing . 
  * but if any one else wants to do it for me ... * :p, 
   not only are they creating more reasons for leaving the eu that 's one of the most stupid things i 've heard . 
  if you 're trying to convict some one in a court of murder and want to make sure he gets convicted , do you try and convince him to start stealing from the jury just to make sure he gets a conviction ? 
  if that is what they 're doing it is as if they do n't think they 're case is strong enough as is so they need to make more reasons . 
  why would you make more reasons ? 
  it 's as if they 're giving themselves a purpose to exist . 
  also , the shitting on your own carpet analogy still holds true . 
  we should turn this into a game . 
  name three news items and see if any one can guess the right answer after three hours . 
  with your i might have said italy . 
  and a huge proportion of the norwegian population watched it , and enjoyed it . 
  same for me and co. 
  most people i know are slightly turned off by the idea , but they do n't really care that much about it being horse . 
  i 'm not so certain . 
  a lot of europhiles advocate the breaking down of the bigger states into a few smaller ones so that they 're vaguely similar in size to each other and thus vaguely equal in representation . 
  i do n't think succession movements have any affect at all on the idea of a common european identity . 
   15 % of territory is occupied ... [ controversial ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo ), 
  and if it is no one reports it because it 's uninterestingly common ;p, 
  i 'll have to keep an eye out for him . 
  i juts like the complete over the topness of this one . 
  it 's like he 's just putting on a show rather than trying to troll . 
  not sure if greece , spain or italy . 
  perhaps serbia ? 
  countries are n't going to expire because they do n't speak english . 
  people are n't going to become useless because they do n't speak english . 
  english is extremely important , but so was latin , so was french and so was german . 
  people maintained their own languages throughout those periods and did fine if marginally worse than if they had adopted the lingua franca . 
  half of your reasons are about the internals of the eu speaking a lot of english as is . 
  you 're funny as trolls go . 
  they want out , i can see that . 
  but why do they have to try and destroy it to be out of it ? 
  if they hate europe so much they should at least be making vague motions at reforming it rather than just dragging their heels every where and making the eu even worse than they believe it is . 
  it just seems stupid . 
  there 's a large chance we could have a referendum and get a resounding `` yes '' vote on staying in . 
  then what ? 
  ukip will be stick being inside the eu . 
  why would you make some thing worse if you stuck with it ? 
  that 's like shitting on your own carpet because you want it gone and your spouse/mother wont let you get rid of it , yet . 
  it really seems stupid . 
  ahh , yeah i remember reading over some post which later on in the line you said to be sarcasm and i had no idea it was intended that way and just came off * extremely * ignorant . 
  the internet does n't understand sarcasm , especially in semi-serious threads , especially over text . 
  better to just avoid sarcasm all together or say * explicitly * and * immediately * that it is sarcasm, 
  you did seem to be getting downvoted quite heavily when i was here before , but for the most part it seemed you earned your downvotes for factual inaccuracy or logical flaws/gaps . 
  that was just my deduction at the time so i ca n't tell you why i thought that , especially as they 're now deleted . 
  normally i would jump in , say i disagree with you but that you should n't be downvoted . 
  but on this instance i was n't sure . 
  did n't vote you down myself because i 'm not fully sure logical gaps is appropriate for downvoting , though some of the misinformation might have been . 
  well , no * nationality * is benefited . 
  any you 're skirting around my point . 
  could you answer the question rather than cracking wise ones . 
  it 's about turning a de facto working language into a de jure working language . 
  if every one speaks english as the standard above french and german , why not plan around that and all agree that it is the appropriate second language of choice transnationally . 
  basically it 's about taking the importance of french and german ( which are the other two current working languages ) and putting that importance into one language so that europe has an accepted standard to work towards . 
  belgium is split down the middle with half speaking french and the other half speaking dutch . 
  there 's also a * tiny * bastion in belgium where german is spoke , but i 'm sure the polish speaking population in the uk is higher than the number of german speakers in that region of belgium . 
  so asia produces a lot of english graduates . 
  good for them . 
  does europe produce a lot of english speaking graduates ? 
  ** yes ** . 
  now there 's a real reason to make the second/working language of the eu english . 
  is he proposing making a law ? 
  it 's very vague what he is calling for . 
  what if ( hypotheticall ) the lingua franca of today was , instead of english , esperanto ? 
  that way we 're all equally ** dis *** advantaged * . 
  if that 's your main problem with having english as the second language of europe , it 's rather a flimsy reason . 
  what are you deleting them for ? 
  i do n't know where this idea is coming from that the german president is saying that all europeans should have to learn english . 
  no smoke without fire . 
  farage 's obstructionist strategies are my favourite example of this . 
  he sits on the fisheries committee ( or what ever it 's called ) and never attends it but feels free to take home the extra pay he gets from it . 
  i completely get that they 're elected to be obstructionist , but why ? 
  surely they should be trying to reform europe rather than just making it worse by wasting its money . 
  that 's adding to the problem , not solving it . 
  personally i think it makes a lot of sense and i like to think that i 'd think the same even if german or french was the obvious choice for a standard language . 
  however , i 'm really unfamiliar with how people feel their cultures and societies might be being threatened . 
  for a lot of us this is n't a problem but , it 'd be really useful to get a conservative , communitarian approach to this and why it might be bad . 
  for a lot of is it 's very obvious this is a good choice , but i 'm sceptical of coming to that conclusion without others making their case properly .
