  so far i do n't think any one has made that case effectively . 
  you communicate on online games ? 
  i thought you just shout about how x is a camper or that guy is totally hacking . 
  which isnt communicating . 
  i 've been trying to learn german for the past year and this is what you do ? 
  make all my efforts waisted ? 
  [ relevant ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/are-you-fucking-kidding-me-face.png ) edit : not actually gon na stop learning german , it makes almost no difference . 
  edited midnight spellings . 
  i highly doubt he 's suggesting that all european abandon their national language and replace it with english . 
  what he 's probably suggesting is that every eu country teach english as the primary second language ( similar to how it already is ) but also raise it 's status in the eu parliament and commission . 
  also , keep in mind this man does n't really have anything to do with the eu apart from being the president of one of the eu 's states . 
  so if you 're thinking this is the eu encroaching on the sovereignty of member states , you can go and re-read the article and try to side line your anti eu bias . 
   let 's assume there 's a large number of people with college degrees without internet . 
  true , but usually internet correlates with wealth and education correlates to wealth . 
  basically people without education and/or from poorer countries are probably poor ( er ) so lack amenities associated with wealth such as internet connections . 
  basically i 'm making the argument reddit is excludes most of eastern europe due to wealth distribution . 
  if eastern europe become better , on average , educated then for what ever reason internet access would probably increase too and thus reddit membership . 
  so there might be a pocket some where or the possibility of a pocket some where of highly educated people without access to internet , but it 's unlikely as the correlation usually works the other way around . 
  it 's a weak argument for what i was trying to use it for and the difficulty i 'm having in explaining it is testament to that . 
  what if he wants to have absolutely no beliefs ? 
  and vote ~ 49.9 % for romney . 
  that made us clench quite painfully . 
  i 'm undecided whether i think / r/europe is more educated than average or not so i 'm just going around poking holes in people 's ideas . 
  it 's worth noting that your statistics gain are benefited a lot be certain groups included in the european figure being heavily excluded from the reddit figure . 
  and i do n't mean by choice . 
  lots of eastern europe lacks english skills , internet access and in some circumstances computer access . 
  those factors make it impossible for them to join in on reddit , but they still continue to lower the european educational average , which might be somewhat unfair . 
  basically what i 'm saying is your statistics are effected by extremes for the european statistics , but not for the / r/europe statistic . 
  this is n't a big problem , wanted to point out that it might not necessarily be an apples for apples comparison . 
  ** additionally ** there are a lot of europhiles on here who are n't from the eu ( russians , australians , americans , balkans , ) who , when all counted up can make up a large portion of those who answered the survey . 
  again , not a huge problem , but it makes the statistics harder to compare . 
  *** awww , shit ***, 
   probably more interested in politics you probably were n't making this connection , but i want to make it clear that interests in politics do n't equal intelligence . 
  i know people that work in reporting and are supposed to , you know , report on politics , and yet they fail to have rudimentary understanding of the systems of governance ( on either an eu or national level ) . 
  they 're interested but they do n't understand . 
  it 's treated more as a soap opera rather than an act in understanding systems and mechanisms or deriving any meaning . 
  additionally , i 've seen * a lot * of idiots around this subbreddit . 
  i 'm not basing that on them having different political opinions to me . 
  i 'm basing it on them being logically inconsistent . 
  defending one thing in a national or eu context and then completely damning it in the other without giving any explanation as to how it 's different even when pressed for an answer . 
  yeah , i really would n't put users of reddit or of this sub reddit any higher than a normal european citizen . 
  as a monoglot ( speaks one language ) british person who knows lots of other people who speak english as their only and some times as their second language , this is completely false on all accounts . 
  there are smart people who know english as a first or second language , but there is no correlation between the two . 
  greece just ca n't get a break . 
  now that you mention it , i remember some one saying those things here . 
  this earns him a '' `` eu undemocratic because too complicated '' '' tag !, 
  ^ ( note , double quotation marks . ), 
  yeah , there 's a lot of ignorant people on both side of the fence with the eu and unfortunately the only way to try and stop it from breeding ( i know i 'm not actually going to change * his * mind ) is by pointing out , usually in a snappy manner , why their views are utter bullshit . 
  usually i get karma for it here , even when i point out logical flaws in europhiles ( so long as i do it nicely , obviously ) so i 'm kind of ok with being a point-out-obvious-bullshit guy . 
  edit : i can not into correct number of speech marks . 
  * the premier chancellor prime minister martin schulz , head , director and chief of the european parliament * president and superintendent of the executive and chief coordinator of managerial processes at the european council , herman van rompuy * leader , commander , supervisor or the european commission and manager of foreign representation , jose manuel borrosso . 
  at least now the names are unique !, 
  [ that 's quite a common way to dispense with old wedding rings ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18801221 ), 
  i look up synonyms for possible alternatives president , chairperson , manager of ( insert ) , governor , premier , chancellor , prime minister head of ( insert ) , leader of ( insert ) , director , head of ( insert ) , chief of ( insert ) , minister , you could even start combining some of these titles . 
  yeah , they could really do with a few more varied names . 
  maybe it 's some to do with having to work in three , to however many languages , but they should really do better . 
   the german president of the european parliament ... warned italians on thursday not to back the scandal-ridden media tycoon at the ballot box . 
  please not the difference between the president of the eu parliament and the eu parliament . 
  the president of the eu parliament is a politician who has opinions . 
  he is not a civil servant bound by secrecy . 
  he can be voted out at the next election because he 's a politician . 
  ** politicians have opinions , that 's basically their job ** . 
  i fail to see how a politician who has been elected to office is some how undemocratic ( as op has already made clear he thinks ) because he made and will continue to make negative statements about other politicians . 
  incase you have n't noticed , politicians spend most of their time trying to explain how the other side is stupid . 
  for instance , [ prime ministers questions ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njcgsbrebig ) . 
  note how the pm spends so much time saying how the other side is doing and has done bad ( edit ) and how other * mps * ( members of government ) critic him personally . 
  note how that is the country 's leader . 
  note how he is head of government and a politician and how this is ** part of a democracy ** . 
  ** this is a part of how democracy modern , western democracies work you idiot . 
  learn that before you start sensationalising every little thing . 
  ** you can say it 's a bad decision to say what schulz said , but you ca n't say it 's undemocratic . 
  edit : forgot to add a link and added an extra clause `` mp ( members of government ) '' ect . 
  the article does n't really have anything to do with china owning greenland either . 
  raised , labeled and killed properly i have no problem with it * being produced * , however i 'm not * quite * sure i would eat it myself . 
  if some one offered it to me i * might * tentatively try it , but some thing about it makes me feel slightly uneasy . 
  there 's no ethical issue for me . 
  either you can eat all animals or you can eat non , and i 'm not a vegetarian . 
  it 's perfectly good meat but i would n't eat my dead cat 's body or my neighbour 's cat 's body , though if my neighbour wants to eat his cat 's body who am i to stop him ? 
  and if he wants to sell his dead cat 's body for other 's to eat ? 
  well , if some one 's into it , i guess they can so long as it has a comical , yet legally required label which says `` contains cat '', 
  it 'd be nice to have data for europe post 2008 . 
  see how much the suicide rate has climbed , especially in iberia and greece . 
  also , keep in mind the dates of data collection are different in the us than the eu . 
  that seems far too insubstantial to be worth mentioning . 
  alternatively i 'd like some one to explain why it 's a good move . 
  so far the only points i have are negatives * eurozone crisis stuff like possible meltdown & money transfers from rich to struggling * less control than they already have over their own currency and positives being * better tourism * getting to influence europe better * european nationalism ( ? ), 
  ^ ( linked to the previous bullet point ) i 'm sure this is not even scratching the surface though . 
  people seem pretty eager to set themselves on fire recently . 
  arab spring martyrs , tibetan monks and now the spanish . 
   not going to lose sleep over it either way . 
  i opt for this one . 
  you could have said the exact same thing using different words and come across very well mannered and reasonable . 
  however now things just kind of seem depressing . 
  if you 'd have at least said `` what was your worst experience in a european country '' as opposed to `` what is your least favourite european country to holiday in '' . 
  you placed the blame with the country and not with your holiday . 
  the holiday is the thing at fault , not the country . 
  oh and i 'd like to say my stay in amsterdam was some of the most fun i 've ever had ( and not because ` drugs ' ) but still makes it to the bottom of my least as i 've never gone to another country besides my own :p, 
  i think you 're definition of successful is a little unideal . 
  a much better definition would be returning mps or securing high numbers of votes or having some sort of representation in government . 
  just because a movement gets huge media coverage ( a huge following ) does n't mean it is successful , but if it has some sort of power in government , it certainly is to an extent successful and will have media attention of some sort .
