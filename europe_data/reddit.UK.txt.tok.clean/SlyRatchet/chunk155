  by that measure scotland is the only separatist movement which has * significant * success . 
  however i think catalonia has certain representation in its devolved government body as well . 
  after that the next most * prominent * would be belgium and i 'm not sure about that at all . 
  i am , in the long run , for fragmentation but i think the eu would have to be much more popular and powerful before we can do that so fragmentation at this point is not a good idea . 
  we should only do it when the necessary steps have ( if ) be achieved . 
  and why does the eu have to deal with this ? 
  should n't we leave it up to the national governments ? 
   whenever they try to communicate with us in our language , let us all immediately start speaking in english , oh there 's really no need to try and mobilise yourselves for that !, 
  it appears that you already do it on principle for the benefit of us silly english . 
  ^ ( site note : ffs it 's hard to try and use those community language learning sites . 
  you try and talk to them in their language and after two minutes they 've `` englished '' you and your speaking english instead of their language . 
  so irritating and every one seems to do it unless you force them to use theirs , even then most people just stop talking to you if you try and use their language / rant ), 
   i was asked whether i was irish or german . 
  : - / i would n't scoff at that !, 
  irish is one of the nicest accents in english . 
  in the scale of nice accents it goes some thing like a mix of ( nice ) scottish , irish , south british , australian and canadian . 
  those are the good ones you want . 
  and german accents tend to sound pretty nice to english ears anyway ( at least in the uk ) . 
  so long as you do n't pick up the north english accents , glaswegian or * god forbid an american accent * you 'll sound nice . 
  rp is overated and really hard to achieve . 
  like i speak incredibly neutrally for a sheffielder , but even i 'm not up to the queen 's standard . 
  ** tl ; dr irish-german accent equals win **, 
  it looks like there is a bavarian flag on the riot police 's helmet . 
  best idea so far . 
  i 'd love a sofa surfing community . 
  i have one idea , mainly for the more anglo-saxon and anglo-irish of us * *** learn more foreign languages and encourage others to *** single best thing that can be done to create a more european community . 
  ok , but to elaborate more . 
  europe would be a much better place if people intermingled more and that is near impossible if people ca n't communicative . 
  so having languages to communicate in is very important . 
  not only is the interaction useful , but also the consumption of other states ' cultures through literature and media outlets ( newspapers , films , ect ) . 
  language learning would basically just allow people to take better advantage of the benefits being european and being in the eu gives ( such as freedom of movement and working rights ) i 'm not sure how best to encourage others to learn , but perhaps create a friendly environment for learners to test out their skills ? 
  i 'm learning german and some times have trouble cementing what i 've learnt properly and having more language partners would seriously help . 
  getting quite tired of the repetitive posting of this petition . 
  what 's this , the 7th time it has been posted ? 
  it 's feeling like a regular event now . 
  that 's an almost non existent sheffield accent , though it sounds slightly like a birmingham brumy accent . 
  most places in sheffield have a * very distinct * way of speaking . 
  not as distinct as geordie , but not as generic as southern variants . 
  fortunately i 've avoided adopting the local accent and through various media conception , internet friends and keeping friends in places not in sheffield i 've managed to avoid adopting a distinct accent of any sort . 
  sheffielders tend to think i 'm ever so slightly american or canadian when they hear me , despite sounding very un-american/canadian . 
  i like it that way , makes me mysterious . 
  i 've been brought up speaking english in sheffield but tend never to go further north . 
  i find it near impossible to understand what a heavily accented scouse or geordie is saying . 
  with the german i think you might find it often gets unfairly stereotyped . 
  for instance , if the first accent a french speaker heard of english was a glaswegian accent , they 'd probably think we 're even more harsh than the germans . 
  when you get germans speaking nice words or using a nice accent it can sound extremely playful . 
  example ^ ( this is a nonsense sentence . 
  i 'm not good enough to make a proper nice sounding sentence that makes sense , so i just put a lot of nice words together . ), 
  yeah , it just kind of sounds nice . 
  i 've said this quite a few times over the months  ** what the fuck greece ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  not sure what the point of this is , apart from stroking the nationalistic ego of britons and europeans . 
  to be honest i 'm surprised spain is so far down the list . 
  how did romania ever get into the eu with out fixing these problems ? 
  the corruption , poor living standards , poor health standards and prolific racism by all : at least the corruption should have been sorted before obtaining membership , right ? 
  you do n't have to imagine it !, 
  looks like we 're going ot have this great , advanced form of democracy , 
  i know historically it was great britain when northern rock collapsed , but no one ever considers the uk a pig any more . 
  no idea about denmark , but i think a lot of people have difficulty drawing the lines , so they do n't bother . 
  i do n't actually remember the campaign itself , but i remember you ridiculing supporters of the private ballot for their opinions in that thread . 
  at least this is drawing attention to the issue of democracy in europe . 
  most europhiles seem to be accepting that this is a problem and by no means a good thing . 
  unfortunately there are are some who are still supporting it . 
  i give you my full support and approval to argue with them as to why this a bad idea as i 've seen such people and felt completely unmotivated to try and argue through their thick skulls , similar to how i feel about arguing with you . 
  i 'm a supporter of europe and the eu , but as i 've said before , i am a huge advocate of reform in europe . 
  the convention which allows secret ballots is an area which appears to need reform . 
  it 's interesting to compare the crisis countries to the big three , and also to compare spain and italy to the big three . 
  puts into perspective how bad the problem would be if one of those too fell compared to how bad it is now . 
   hiding from the electorate is no solution ** . 
  w ** eaken the parties not the people sorry , but it is quite hard to understand without the full stop . 
  i do n't mean to be grammarnazi-ish , but yeah , sorry . 
  also , i totally agree with you . 
  *** your meps *** http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/performsearch.html?search=true&amp;webcountry=gb&amp;webtermid=7 http://www.europarl.org.uk/view/en/your_meps/list-meps-by-region.html;jsessionid=101ab9d3ab90b84994f27bf29bed5801 i suggest writing to them and telling them you think this is a stupid idea . 
  also , if you live in yorkshire & the humber like me , would you please vote !, 
  there 's a member of the bnp representing us because not enough people voted in the european elections to keep out the crazies . 
  maybe we should get one of those e-petisions going for the secret ballot to not happen ? 
  ** ps , will update later with a list of meps who think secret ballots are a good idea **, 
  that or you made what you were saying really hard to follow . 
  and send angry letters to them about how they undermine democracy in our view and how we 're not going to vote for them . 
  they should know we do n't like them before we vote them out . 
  you do know that belarus is literally a dictatorship ? 
  as in it 's literally more corrupt than russia or turkey by a long way . 
  surely , turkey or even russia should be put higher on the list than belarus given that they 're problems can be fixed through reformations where as belarus 's can only really be fixed by overhauling their entire government and the way it works . 
  now all the eurosceptics are going to laugh at us and we do n't even have a retort because it 's all bloody true . 
  european parliament , you 're being an embarrassment . 
  yeah , we both probably have better things to do than argue about how attractive prince harry is like a couple of teenaged girls . 
  [ you do n't dig this man ? 
  ] ( http://imnotobsessed.com/wp-content/uploads/fp_7455852_barm_cup_061311.jpg ) those read cheeks ? 
  the eyes ? 
  his hair ? 
  smile ? 
  sense of humour ? 
  not getting it for you ? 
  oh well , yeah there 's some consensus on him being quite the cutie . 
  ever wonder why those pictures of him naked were in such high demand , like kate 's wear ? 
  i a ( reasonable , kind of , mostly ) straight guy and he is quite dreamy . 
  anyway , even if he 's not personally your cup of tea , he does have all the right features to be considered broadly attractive . 
   i do n't see most of these things as problems inherent in expansion i did n't say they were inherent of expansion , i said they were systematic of expanding too quickly . 
   issues with how the eu was designed in the last treaty yes , issues with the treaty , however that is half my point . 
  the eu is not ready to accept these members due to the political system being built for a smaller amount of states .
