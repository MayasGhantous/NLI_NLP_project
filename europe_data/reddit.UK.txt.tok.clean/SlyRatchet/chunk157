   world will implode along with the resources we need to survive . 
  ah , false alarm . 
   `` i 'm not saying i 'm for the privatisation of water , but it 's worth considering that food is a human right , yet the state has no mandate to feed is '' ... ect by slyratchet \u00a9 if i 'd have known i would have people repost that post so many times i would have tried to make it a little better written . 
  i made this exact point last time this came up . 
  i feel like i have fans [ : you guys , following what posts i make and stuff :p, 
   denied their ** right ** to know how their representatives vote in parliament , as proposed by him . 
  i 'm in no way advocating private voting . 
  i think it is retarded . 
  i 'm merely stating it 's not a right . 
  i 'm not even sure it 's a civil liberty . 
   do n't think some superior `` oh you 're being childish '' will cut it thing # 2 : was n't this exactly what you did when you started talking about him being a mere university student , ect ? 
  i 'm not advocating any one 's position here . 
  i 'm just reading over posts and i found that glaring and worth saying for your benefit as well as the benefit of onlookers . 
  yeah i know who he is . 
  i tend to tag people if i see them on more than two occasions . 
  he 's `` thinks eu like ussr '' . 
  all the regulars here and on my other favourite reddits are tagged so i can actually remember who they are without memorising bland usernames . 
  the majority of times i do like to respond to him . 
  if not arguing my case , at least to explain briefly why i disagree and explain i 'm not going it take it further . 
  that 's mainly because he writes a lot more words than the average redditor and partly because i know he 's an immovable object , as i probably am to him . 
  the derailing is pretty irritating though . 
  i do n't want to argue with the eu on * every single / r/europe thread * which he seems to try to . 
  that 's perhaps one instance where a simple down vote is acceptable . 
  i 'm quite tempted to call them just to say hello . 
  they probably get very lonely . 
  i do n't see why you 're turning this into a personal attack . 
  and the way you started talking about the problems of the eu half way through feels incredibly forced and irrelevant to any point you might have been trying to make . 
  utterly pointless . 
  all you 're trying to do is make me out to be an idiot which serves no purpose . 
  no purpose that i can see . 
  i was n't aware you needed to be one to make a public service announcement . 
  i 've messaged this to the moderators to see if any response is given . 
   unlikely to be polite * which is pointless and only serves to aggravate people pointlessly . 
  if you 're going to be irksome due to an amount of people using the voting system in this incorrect way , then we might as well use the system properly and avoid your side-step your unpleasantness . 
  i understand why you see it pointless to be polite , i would like you to remain polite anyway , but understand that that is not going to happen if the way this reddit works remains how it is . 
  so we should change the way we use this reddit for a whole flurry of reasons , not least of which it inspires people to be rude and pointlessly irritating . 
  sub-reddits can be extremely nice communities so it 'd be good if people being pointlessly irksome were kept to a minimum . 
  * ^ ( side note . 
  feel free to ignore  i would like to take a moment to say i think it 's rather immoral of you to be trying to personally upset people with `` verbal jabs '' just because of their beliefs , however misguided you see those beliefs to be . 
  i 'm extremely certain that atheism is true , however i do not try and force my world view upon people who hold other believes , no matter how misguided i believe them and i especially do not try and ruin their day for their believes and hope that it will be reciprocated . ), 
  * oh , and if the voting system was improved to be more like the standard throughout reddit , maybe you 'd get better debate , probably better rebuttals against your theories which i 'm sure you would appreciate . 
  europhiles hashing out their ideas better than currently would doubtless be interesting to you and you 'd surely continue to find good counter arguments in a way you find entertaining . 
  so many good reasons to use the system properly , eh ? 
  while that 's how it works in practice at the moment * in this sub-reddit * that is by no means the best way to do it or the way it has to be . 
  there are plenty of other sub-reddits which hold a variety of individuals with a variety of contradictory views but still maintain a good standard of conversation which is lacking in this sub-reddit . 
  other sub-reddits indicate it is completely possible to use the system as it was intended and even proves that using the system in that way is highly beneficial . 
  that 's why we should use it the intended way . 
  it works and it creates much better standards of conversation , discussion and debate . 
  not simply because it 's in the reddiquette . 
  however , if it is in the there we should probably use it and understand that that is the established convention , even if it is not the established convention in this crevice . 
  ** wtf are you people down-voting for ?!, 
  ** i understand that no one likes their dreams to be stamped on , especially if you think they 're wrong , but 12 of you guys just down-voted sturle and then all of you went on to ed ____ because one of them stated reasons why norwegians do n't want to be in the eu and the other merely made a comment on your style of downvoted which is against reddit rules as is . 
  i buy into the federal europe dream . 
  i think it would be awesome , but i do n't fucking down vote people for stating views that are different , especially when they 've made no motion to those being the views held . 
  seriously / r/europe i like it . 
  i like a lot of the people and i like the european dream and the sense of european community , but whoever is doing all this downvoting needs to go and read the fucking [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) . 
  it 's not hard to find , i even hyperlinked it for you . 
  read the section on what the down-vote button is for . 
  there 's a large number of you which just act like a hive-mind and it 's bloody stupid . 
  if you disagree , say why and do n't up-vote . 
  do n't down-vote unless they contribute nothing to the conversation . 
  you 're making all europhiles look bad and by-enlarge the entire european project . 
  you have no idea how many times i 've had to step in and say that not all europhiles are as short sited as some of you . 
  how many times i 've had to state that not all europhiles are idiots . 
  you 're making the european project look like it 's stupid . 
  ** stop it ** . 
  ** now ** . 
  / rant tl ; dr you 're making us all look retarded , well done . 
  *** edit : *** * you 're still failing to explain why you 're downvoting me . 
  we really need to sort out the downvoting convention here . 
  it 's stupid and against the reddequette . 
  i do n't think he was being serious . 
  out of curiosity , what do they speak there if not german ? 
  calling people `` intellectual nothings '' is a pretty pointless statement in itself . 
  flakwolf definitely knows his stuff , even if i disagree with his conclusions . 
  i 'd advise not calling people things for what ever reason and simply sticking to the content . 
  now he just has something else to call you an idiot for . 
  i suggest you be helpful some other way . 
  it looks very irritating . 
  also i do n't see a distinction between enlightening people about the appropriate use of capitalisation or the appropriate use of the word `` good '' or `` well '' . 
  they seem equally arbitrary . 
  * sigh * when you originally started being a grammar nazi in this thread you were picking up on pointless mistakes where every one could still understand the sentence . 
  ether you 're being incredibly , naively , inconsistent ; you 've honestly changed your views since your originally started ; or you 're deliberately changing what you say your views are so as to make yourself not seem pointless . 
  all of them are pretty redundant . 
  i 'd recommend acknowledging that you were just being an irritating grammar nazi and moving on . 
  sounds like a line in the sand . 
  scratch my first post . 
  turns out i have some extra time . 
   this is just pure unadulterated condescension from a know-nothing who likes to lecture people about how much he knows about society when he 's probably never even had a real job or experience of the world outside of university . 
  that 's quite a leap of logic . 
  he 's saying something you do n't agree with and something you think has illogical jumps , and now you 've made the assumptions he does n't have a job . 
  that 's quite an illogical jump in itself . 
   the europhiles constantly stink up the place this is / r/europe so you 'd expect to see people who really buy into europhile ideas . 
   do n't lecture me on reddiquette when it 's been totally abandoned here it 's not been abandoned apart from the downvote system which is extremely regrettable and i would advise people to get back to using the proper method of only downvoting when a comment adds nothing to a conversation . 
  however most other reddiquette is perfectly in order . 
   this is n't a genteel discussion this is an intellectual battle . 
  you 're really romanticising arguing/yelling at people over their believes . 
  you 're not going to convince any one here . 
  you can prove yourself right as much as you want through individuals failure to accurately articulate way the european project is decent and through individuals own failures to explain things clearly . 
  it 's a conversation .
