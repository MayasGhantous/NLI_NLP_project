  it 's not a battle . 
  yelling seldom solves anything . 
  calm discussion does and bringing up people 's passed is more of a battle than a discussion . 
   there people are seeking to willfully destroy democracy and they will be opposed to the very end it 's good that you have strong believes , but arguing on the internet is a very poor way to opposed . 
  perhaps join a political party like ukip or hand out fliers or something . 
  going to the european subbreddit and arguing with any one who thinks differently to you for what ever reason seems like a waist of efforts on your part and irritating to others who 're simply enjoying a community and enjoying the discussions of idea how ever flawed you might see those ideas and communities to be . 
   so you can stop trying to be a little reddit cop with your comments to me , either debate as well , just vote or ignore because i am not going to change my opposition to these fascists . 
  a ) you appear to be advocating what has become of / r/europe 's up/down vote system b ) you seem to be heavily generalising europhiles here . 
  not only are you saying they 're fascists which is n't directly true but is quite a jump , what ever base that quite large jump might have it 's still hyperbole . 
  but most of all you 're generalising all / r/europe 's members as if they all hold the same view which is woefully untrue . 
  anyway . 
  there are countless flaws in every single even slightly long reddit post as your post proves . 
  you 've stated a clear narrative , a clear set of goals and a clear point of view however i 've still managed to poke various holes in your point of view despite its apparent comprehensiveness . 
  i very much doubt you 'll change me in my views of you and i very much doubt i will change you in your views of you . 
  so we both end up thinking each other are wrong irrespective of what the truth is . 
  it 's very easy to be misled about what people truley think , especially when you put them on the spot and especially when they 're on the internet where ( i 'm going to generalise too here ) are properly still young or are probably uninformed of the full idea . 
  ** tl ; dr ** * please do n't generalise europhiles . 
  generalising europe is hard enough . 
  * do n't see debate ** here ** as some sort of noble , romantic endeavour . 
  it is n't . 
  you 're arguing with a whole host of people who 've considered the european dream to varying degrees , some of them in depth and some of them shallow . 
  * i do n't see what you see in going around here and trying to argue with random europhiles . 
  * again , please stop generalising . 
  this is a very small community of people who like europe , who use the internet , who use reddit who happen to want to use reddit for joining in with a community of europe lovers . 
  it 's by no means a comprehensive community and in many ways is exceptionally , extremely limited in its scope of europhiles . 
  ** pss ** yeah , you 've drawn me into making some huge statement about what my views are and now you 're going to put holes in it like i 've done you and you 've done many before . 
  i 've , as ever , done a poor job of putting holes in for a variety of reasons . 
  i was hoping to avoid this 1,000 word long rants , but well done . 
  you 've made me do it . 
  i was n't particularly looking for an argument . 
  if you want me to hear out what you 're saying here , please reduce it to less than 1,000 words . 
  i really do n't want to spend 10-20 minutes reading through that and coming up with what will have to be an equally articulate response . 
  tl ; dr shorten that or it will fall on death ears . 
   making yourself seem extremely pretentious and what are you doing ? 
  not interested . 
  the land and natural gas is nice and everything but russia has too many of its own problems , is too culturally different and is too ` putin-y ' . 
  russia would need to subdue itself before eu accession is considered . 
  invading georgia is n't very subdued . 
  russia also needs to improve its standards of living immensely and protect human rights better . 
  it 's a nice pipe dream for a century 's time . 
  for now i just like to think about more close european integration and a more accountable eu . 
  when that 's achieved i 'll look at the prospect of russia and turkey joining more favourably and with a hint of hope that it might happen . 
  can we stay on the topic of this thread please , instead of randomly bringing up crap that might have been said in other foreign places . 
  meps calling to have their vote on the eu budget in private is a very interesting issue , but perhaps we should have that conversation in a different thread or at least wait for the conversation to go near that subject , instead of just bringing up alleged hypocrisy of certain redditors . 
  deal !, 
  but first , you fix this whole `` euro crisis '' thing . 
  ` couple of my friends would n't be happy if we started changing all the coins while that whole thing is going on . 
  fix it and let the exchange begin !, 
  in their defence , it 's not so much what you 're saying , but the way you 're saying it . 
  most of what you say is fairly legitimate , even if we disagree with it on many grounds , but you always treat the people you 're talking to like children which really riles every one up and can often lead to a torrent of downvotes . 
  i would love the queen to be on euros . 
  show all those other european monarchs who 's the girl . 
  that would make sense . 
  however it does n't seem to be wholly accurate of the real world situation . 
  cameron 's not proposing to leave europe for a start and churchill never said the uk should be in a use . 
  i 'll just write it off as a sup bar cartoon . 
  `` i dream of a world , where the european parliament is in one city , 100 % of the time '' martin luther ^ ( tm ), 
  comments on online newspapers are notoriously poor . 
  even when they share my opinion i think the commenter is stupid . 
  some of the ones on that article seem ok , at a stretch , but i did n't look deep and i bet there 's a ton hiding behind the second page or so . 
  the bloody better accept it . 
  as a europhile i 'll be pissed off with them and they 'll make the whole eu look incompetent . 
  i like this deal . 
  it 's a reduction and that looks good . 
  the eu does not need more funding and an overwhelming majority of eu citizens recognise that . 
  the ep should do what the majority want , not what they as europhiles think is right . 
  they 're delegates of the people . 
  they should n't abuse that power . 
   pay attention please please do n't try and act like you 're intellectually superior to those who hold a different view to you . 
  that not only makes you hard to like but it also makes you hard to sympathise with and what you believe . 
  i try to sympathise with your points of view and allow myself to be won other if i feel appropriate . 
  i 'd expect the same in return . 
   so why would i sign up for something worse that 's going to get worse ? 
  it looks like it ca n't get better from where * you * 're standing right now . 
  however that does n't unequivocally make it true . 
  at the present moment i do n't see the eu as a viable federation , but that does n't mean it ca n't be in the future . 
  it needs reforms and it needs a lot of them , however those reforms are within reach . 
  the uk used to be a collection of kingdoms run by a minority for the minority and now the uk is one the most effective democracies in the world ( when compared against the world , not against fellow westerners , i 'll admit ) . 
  germany and france went through similar reformations , revolutions and evolutions . 
  the eu should and will do the same . 
  if the eu fails , that 'll be sad but it could happen and if it does i 'll still dream of european unity through a different organisation and only if it is competent organisation which the eu is not ** at the moment ** however as it is a government with the ability to evolve and as there is obviously a desire amongst the general public for it to evolve , it will evolve and it will evolve to become more democratic and more open . 
  the uk only got freedom of information in the last decade . 
  we got that far without even using it . 
  i 'm not saying that 's ideal , but i 'm saying it 's not as outlandish as you might think . 
  i 'm not proposing we join a federation with no freedom of information . 
  i wont vote yes until that 's in place , but just because it does n't have freedom of information * yet * does n't mean it wont in the future and that it wont become more competent in the future . 
  that 's my very poorly articulate view on the matter . 
  i 've appreciated yours and not made any snarky comments no matter how necessary i thought it . 
  i expect you to reciprocate it . 
   secret ballots in parliament being ** proposed , ** immunity from prosecution being ** proposed ** , total secrecy for budget documents being ** proposed ** , rules in parliament being abused to attack sceptics ^ ( [ 1 ] ) , corrupt expenses not being prosecuted ^ ( [ 2 ] ) , budgets not being audited properly ^ ( [ 3 ] ) , the straight faced justification of civil servant propaganda agents , people ** calling ** * ^ ( note : calling , not doing ) * for sceptics not to be in the parliament , pensions of civil servants linked to their loyalty to the project ^ ( [ 4 ] ) and many other things . 
  1 that sounds a little like hyperbole based on your position and personal political stance . 
  it 's very easy to sympathise with one group and see them as the under dog if you look purely from their perspective . 
  unless you 'd like to provide some sources . 
  2 did you hear about the mps ' expenses scandal ? 
  or all of the mps ' expenses in a whole host of other countries abusing their benefits and salary systems ? 
  you can hear about them and know that people and the authorities know , yet they are not persecuted . 
  corrupt expenses is by no means uncommon and it does not show a clear correlation between that and utopian dictatorships , ect . 
  3 bad audits = dictatorship ? 
  ok i 'm taking you out of context there , but still . 
  it 's indicative of bad government and bad economics , not of being corrupt or potentially being corrupt in the future .
