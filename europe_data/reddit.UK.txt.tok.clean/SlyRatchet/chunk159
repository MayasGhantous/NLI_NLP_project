  as for all the highlighted `` proposed '' and `` calling for '' bits , yeah the eu parliament proposes a whole load of bad ideas . 
  parliaments do that . 
  175 british mps voted against the gay marriage bill . 
  that seems pretty bad to me in a similar ( though obviously not identical ) way to meps ** proposing ** the suppression of eurosceptics . 
  ** mps and meps ** say a lot of crazy crap and a lot of it gets shouted down . 
  the crazy eurohpiles in the ep are in the minority , though that minority is not as small as i would like . 
  however , that is not even the biggest reason why the ep having dictatorial tendencies is irrelevant . 
  that reason would be because we have proper separation of powers and it will remain that way as our parliaments remain sovereign . 
  the commission and the council of ministers tendencies are much less evident and consist of a let less dictatorial crazies . 
  the ep is one of the weaker bodies in the eu as it can not propose legislation and therefor relies on the more moderate eu bodies to propose it . 
  4 could you elaborate on that point a little . 
  sources , explanation , et cetera . 
  i also wanted to say i definitely see what you 're saying i just disagree with your evidence and by enlarge the conclusion , but i can empathise with your train of thought . 
  sorry for the long post . 
  he 's doing that to an extent , however some of them are genuinely very good thinkers who i know i do n't mind occasionally differing to the opinions of . 
  john stuart mill being the prime example . 
  british europhiles using churchill as an example of why we should join a federal union is definitely historically bias , but it is at least a good point in the favour of of a federal european union , though not necessarily one with a uk in it . 
  my main thing here is * ` do n't tare us all with the same brush ' * . 
  i remember that not all eurosceptics are farage and hope that most eurosceptics can remember that us europhiles are n't , umm , borroso ( ? ), 
  or guy vohofstadt . 
  call me stupid but i 'm not fully certain what this picture us saying : /, 
  he did n't forget napoleon  people who believed that such an entity would be or should be : george washington , ** napoleon ** , mazzini , victor hugo , garibaldi , john stuart mill , mikhail bakunin , trotsky , john maynard keynes and churchill . 
  amongst others . 
  you 're missing hitler . 
  he wanted europe to be united , but i imagine his vision was a little more different from the guys you mentioned than the guys you mentioned 's visions differ between each other . 
  i was expecting scandinavia to be much higher . 
  also ; gender equality is nice ; the quota system is n't perfect but nether is free market of labour ; southern and eastern europe could do better and how ( if ) they do is up to them . 
  i had no idea what mt stood for , now i know it 's you malta !, 
  feel my glance of smug superiority which could have been avoided had you been quiet !, 
  *** ouch !, 
  *** if i was french i 'd be pretty hurt by that , emotionally . 
  it 's like when those americans dumped all our tea just to spite us :( and maybe make a political gesture , but mostly it just hurt our feelings . 
  [ they never ignore the rules of the wto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chaf5nheuym ), 
  maybe you have genuinely cheap holidays as apposed to ones artificially cheap due to currency craziness ? 
  maybe poland 's the same . 
  just guessing . 
  oh not the fucking war again . 
  no one cares about it , apart from the germans . 
  all the pre war stuff is history and newspapers should stop bringing it up . 
  whenever euroscepticism in the uk is discussed they go on about how the uk used to have an empire and how that is affecting our relationship with europe today : ** no it fucking is n't ** . 
  so portugal , how would you feel about turning 90 % of your land area into solar panels ? 
  oh , and we can talk about that dept of yours , 
  we should really introduce them to the idea of a media company owned by the state , like the bbc . 
  if they want entertainment paid through taxes , the bbc costs no where near 5 % of gdp and very few people have been killed as a result of the bbc , though many children were sexually abused . 
  the pedophile thing obviously makes it a hard decision . 
  better stick with killing islamists people who look like they could potentially be islamists . 
  the member states make up the eu , so it 's also the eu 's fault . 
  they 're both to blame is what i am and was trying to say . 
   however it is still ** partly ** the eu 's fault for allowing, 
  it feels as though we should n't have let cyprus in . 
  letting in a country from an unstable part of the world which does not have the military might or diplomatic power to effectively defend itself from nearby forces should not be in a european union . 
  we should n't be letting turkey in ether as it 's effectively occupying a neighbouring country with no serious grounds and technically it is occupying the european union . 
  a lot of the eu 's problems , especially the cyprus situation , would n't be here if the eu had expanded more slowly , dealt with problems slowly and effectively as they arose then expanded a little bit-repeat . 
  now all the 27 members ca n't be ejected and we have to deal with a lot of ineffective governments which now have a lot of influence over western european life . 
  i broadly back the eu idea and the eu project . 
  i back the idea of turkey being in a future eu , but i think that idea should be advanced towards slowly and be thought through . 
  we should n't be adding member states which ca n't protect them selves and then not protect them . 
  it 's silly . 
  as a potential super power , we can do much better . 
  however it is still partly the eu 's fault for allowing such stupidity to be possible with its institutions . 
  it 's france 's fault , but france really should n't be able to hold shit up like this any way , which is why it 's also the eu 's fault for not being able to stop it . 
  separation of powers does n't need protecting . 
  the legislature , executive and the judiciary are n't about to merge . 
  if they are , then why should we try and deliberately stop them ? 
  cohesion of powers works well in the uk and other parliamentary democracies . 
  forcibly separating powers and making it difficult to ever fuse them * based on distance * is an incredibly stupid idea . 
   serious circus . 
  is there such a thing ? 
  but that sounds like federalism which makes people go *** '' bwwwweehhh '' ***, 
   it must be the largest waste of money ever in a democracy . 
  us defence spending ? 
  well , seeing as you asked , my place is n't a normal tourist destination , but i would let vips see it . 
  ^ ( obviously not being serious , * unless you 're up for it * ), 
   lithuania , which holds the rotating six month eu presidency , i though ireland was holding the eu presidency . 
  ether they change that far too quickly , or time travels faster than i thought . 
  we could replace the cap too , could n't we ? 
  along side austria and britain 's rebates . 
  stop trying to look cool infront of everyone :p, 
  so backwards . 
  next thing you know they 'll be marrying their children and the pigs . 
  calling things orwellian is very much in fashion at the moment . 
  for all the talk there is ( or was ) about the coalition breaking up , now it seems far more likely that the conservative party will split in two before the coalition does . 
  i like that he is managing to assert dominance over his party ( at least on this issue ) . 
  i 'd rather that he put his foot down on things and get through a proper vision rather than some times giving into hardline conservatives and some times giving into the more liberal wings , thus ending up with a mishmash of completely incompatible ideologies . 
  ^ ( not saying it is or is not my view ) it 's thought that he 's made a lot of bad decisions , and basically no good ones . 
  being a pro austerity government and having a party split between moderate conservatives and , well the 175 who voted not to have gay marriage . 
  he 's thought to be pretty powerless and whenever he does do anything it 's usually the wrong thing , apart from this . 
  i think it 's to do with the federalist ideology . 
  you ca n't have a sovereign state and 27 different sets of armed forces pushing different agendas . 
  if you want a single , federal state you have to have one set of armed forces pushing one agenda , an eu agenda . 
  the us has been trying to persuade europe to unify its armed forces for a while now . 
  personally i 'm pro federalisation , but i 'm displeased with the european parliament in the way its members are trying to achieve this goal . 
  they 're not really discussing it , just kind of doing it . 
  not really thinking that much about it ether . 
  i 'm pro-federalisation , but i do n't think we should be federal yet and i do n't think we should be federal until we 've discussed it properly . 
  also , there 's no reason we have to have that discussion right now . 
  we do n't have to become federal this decade and i think it 's being forced too quickly , without proper provision . 
  if more time was taken over such decision and more trouble shooting made , we would n't have so many problems . 
  oh come on !, 
  you guys must have more ugly buildings than this ?
