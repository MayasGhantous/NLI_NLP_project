  i do n't travel round england that much and i see more ugly buildings virtually every where . 
  you 're ether cleverly trying to make your countries look nice , or you actually have really amazing buildings every where . 
  first thing i thought of when i saw that picture . 
   i ca n't remember the last time anyone i knew spoke about europe aside from my grandparents who actually asked me what i think because they were not sure . 
  ( really proud about this , they read the daily mail and are both in their 80s yet do n't blindly follow it 's lead . ), 
  you should be proud , i would be . 
   lets hope for a well run campaign ( from both sides ) definitely agree . 
  despite how much farage gets on my nerves he ( least from what i 've seen ) seems like a reasonably honest guy . 
  i disagree with him , but i ca n't say he 's wrong on many things , which is n't true of that many politicians . 
  however most of his compatriots and friendly tabloids like to lie a fair bit . 
  if the newspapers do n't go crazy , i might actually enjoy it . 
  for now though , i get a little tired of the consent opinion polls on uk opinion on the eu , ect . 
  we have at least fives year before the referendum , and that 's if the conservatives get in . 
  i 'm just hoping the real message does n't get lost , as is so often the case . 
  maybe , it seems like the only people who maybe do n't know are the floating voter demographic , who often ( but not always ) pursaded by political rhetoric . 
  anyway , i do n't think the guys in / r/europe or / r/ukpolitics or even / r/unitedkingdom are part of that demographic . 
  they all seem to be extremely well read so any information posted will probably do little to persuade . 
  the isle of man is where it 's at . 
  if not the falklands , those are pretty british . 
  we 'd do a pretty good job of it too . 
   no democratic person on earth would consent many would consent . 
  i fear that you 're making a lot of sever judgements about people you ether know very little about or have never met ( talking about non governmental europhiles here ) . 
  for instance i 'm indifferent to these `` thought police '' and just because it 's being done by the side i support ( yeah i like the eu , look how bias i am ) . 
  proliferation of false facts is viciously against my ethics . 
  i do n't believe they should be knowingly passed on under almost any circumstances . 
  i believe they should have a light shone on them at every possible opportunity no matter where they come from . 
  unfortunately the eu is incapable of having some one point the torch for them and thus is the victim of false facts of to an astonishing degree . 
  if the same was true of the ukip or similar campaigns i would advocate it on their behalf . 
  to be honest i quite like the idea of fact checkers . 
  i do n't like that they 're only going to be contradicting euroskeptic false facts and think it should be enlarged to all false facts and i mean indisputably wrong facts such as `` x said this '' when he clearly did not . 
  that goes for all walks of life and by no means solely the eu . 
  as for your fascination with the idea that these `` thought police '' ( they 're not police . 
  they do n't persecute ) and specifically them being incompatible with democracy : we 're already the perpetrators of what you might consider undemocratic action and by that i mean the short fund which political parties in the uk can claim to help fund themselves . 
  surely that 's more undemocratic then this ? 
  it puts a huge bias in the system towards existing parties meaning that the same parties always get represented , ect . 
  surely that is less compatible with democracy than `` thought police '' ? 
  it seems that the sensationalist europhiles you speak of are similar to yourself in your comparisons of the eu to the soviet union , which i 'm sure is at least in part because of these euromyths . 
  [ my high score is some where around 130 ] ( http://www.sporcle.com/games/g/world ), 
  even more impressive when you realise that several countries bellow malta have mandatory voting whilst malta does not . 
  very impressive . 
  sounds similar to labour and the conservatives in britain . 
  they 're basically the same party with different people and semantic changes . 
  i 'm british , an avid europhile and it is getting really tiresome to see constantly , every where `` will britain leave ? '', 
  `` can britain leave ? '', 
  `` what 's farage doing ? '', 
  `` ukip got two percent points in a poll higher '' `` borrosso says he will do _______ to keep uk in eu '' all of these kind of stories get quite tiring . 
  will we leave or wont we ? 
  most people have probably made up their mind at this point on the likely hood of staying or leaving and have probably even thought about whether they should or should n't stay !, 
  how come you guys are so fanatical about it ? 
  do you know how long it 'll take to pass into law ? 
  i know certain acts in the uk have huge amounts of time put on them to give the country time to prepare , like for the freedom of information act which got like 5 years before it was implemented . 
  oh fuck-nuggets . 
  we are ? 
  always felt if we did let any european culture , it would be strictly the western stuff like french food , spanish holidays , ect . 
  ca n't think of any slavic imports cultural , or physical except obviously horse meat . 
  i 've explained my views in depth in other threads . 
  i do n't feel like explaining them to you again here where you will reject them on predictable grounds which i intern reject , making the whole process pointless and unsatisfying . 
  i complain about you because you 're extremely insufferable . 
  you arguments are reasonable . 
  i think you 're wrong , but you argue on reasonably well . 
  however the way you argue and is extremely irritating just to read . 
  that is why i was not talking to you . 
  that 's not really my experience of it . 
  people some times say some thing that is slightly out there sincerely , but it is still a funny thing to be saying so they 've used a smiley . 
  it conveys light heartedness , but light heartedness does not convey insincerity . 
  i know , but there 's really a lack of good ways to indicate being insincere . 
  the smile face can be misinterpreted as just a sort of internet equivalent of body language . 
  it 's like there being no non disgusting word for ` vagina ' . 
  there is also no perfect way of saying this is a joke , without often ruining the joke . 
  curse you world !, 
  ^ ( ps , sorry for the over kill response earlier ), 
  oh that implied it was a joke :( i did n't understand . 
  i 'm used to people using '' / s '' to display them not being fully serious . 
  that does n't really hold up . 
  this was made by the esa which means it was probably made by european citizens which means she is a european citizen so it 'd be incredibly surprising if she did n't know what the euro symbol was or misinterpreted this $ for this $ . 
  also , there was certainly an entire crew behind her who would have said `` you said dollars not euros '' . 
  they must have made the decision to quantify in dollars and i ca n't fathom why they made that decision . 
   jumped some 377,000,000,000 ** dollars ** seems odd that the ** european ** space agency would opt for using the american currency to quantify rather than the currency a plurality of europeans use . 
  odd, 
   should the us not have been around with libya we would have just bought armaments ourselves  france has not begged for help , they do n't need it , he 's probably going to be downvoting you for that . 
  every thread i 've seen him spouting his views he always goes on about how all european powers have been basically powerless in all their wars , ect . 
  check his pots history , you ca n't argue with him . 
  he wont accept it . 
   but it gets pretty xenocentric around here from time xeno \u2022 centric outside \u2022 thinking ? 
  i 'm not quite sure what you mean . 
  this has no place in / r/europe this is about america . 
  if you want to hate on america , please do it in an american reddit or some where dedicated to this sort of stuff . 
  this has nothing to do with our sub reddit . 
  i 'd rather that the americans reduce the amount of defence deployed in europe in line with how much european nations are reducing their armed forces . 
  the us spends 5 % of it 's gdp on defence . 
  we do n't and we do n't want to . 
  if america is annoyed with the bill , america can reduce its nato foot print in proportion to how much other nations are . 
  if that leaves a cavity where defence needs to be deployed in europe , european nations can fill that cavity and maybe even fill it using more pooled eu resources . 
  if america is constantly providing our defence , why are we going to raise ? 
  it 's a `` put up , or shut up '' kind of argument . 
  we 'll deal with our military inefficiencies when we need to and that time wont come so long as the us is perfectly happy to deal with our inefficiencies for us . 
  cue people talking about how britain is going to become part of the islamic caliphate or some how polish will be the dominant language by some arbitrary date . 
  i do believe you 're thinking of some certain other conflicts that happened in the previous decade . 
  however , do n't hold them to such high esteem . 
  they were almost , if not more disappointing in the beginning just like this conflict .
