  whether you like free markets or not , it 's making its claims as if they 're fact and that 's simply not true . 
  i 'm not saying they 're wrong , but there 's no consensus that says they 're right on how this works . 
  they claim that liberal water markets will drive down quality when in theory they drive quality up . 
  ( there 's debate on this issue in certain industries but it is extremely far from a finished debate ) not only that but the campaign completely ignores the fact that in the efta we have quality standards for all produce which very explicitly covers water . 
  our quality in europe is ensured no matter who 's ensuring the water itself . 
  touch\u00e9 , though you guys saying things like `` i 'm a history student '' and thus ` my knowledge is comprehensive ' along with `` i know more than you ever will '' . 
  they 're very poorly supported and pretty arbitrary . 
  people use both terms synonymously when they 're not . 
  we have to deal with it . 
  no point telling every one they 're wrong . 
  if people want to call the whole collection britain just deal with it . 
  no one is going to mannage to explain to every one that '' * no the uk is these four and england is that one and great britain includes three of them but excludes bits of some but they can still call , ect * '' . 
  people use them interchangeably and we might as well deal with it . 
  it 's not a big issue . 
  if we 're going to start arguing about the * really fine print * we ; re not much better than those guys rioting because of ** a fucking flag ** . 
   i dare say i know more about irish history than you ever will , [ oh no he did n't !,

  there 's a / r/eupolitics ? 
  thank you for this information . 
  on another note this article seems like it 's been incredibly poorly translated . 
  hey !, 
  i love my yorkshire tap water !, 
  do n't go trying to give me non of your `` clean '' tap water . 
  it cant beat the tang of my yorkshire ' . 
  damn it !, 
  i knew i should have burned a ^ ( tm ) or ^ ( \u00a9 ) mark into that post !, 
  * shakes fist *, 
  if i looked at a map i would agree with you however in terms of rockets being haphazardly fired into that place from syria , i would n't consider it near . 
  i really should edit my original post : / every one seems to think i want the water industries privitised when that 's not the case . 
  i never intentionally said what my stance was , but merely that i thought ** the eu should n't be enforcing nationalisation ** . 
  that 's my stance . 
  i think that a nationalised water industry is a good thing and so is healthcare and transport . 
  most other things should be run by the market though . 
  my point was it 's not the eu 's job to tell national governments whether they should have a socialist system for the water industry . 
  that 's not the eu 's job . 
  that 's national governments ' job . 
  if they want to have these petitions for national governments i think that would be fantastic and i would sign , however this is not the eu 's job and at the moment i do n't want it to be . 
  in the future , maybe . 
  i really think it might work ** in the future ** , but not now . 
  when the eu has reformed then it might be its role to tell governments to be more or less socialist . 
  but not now . 
  that 's my point and every one seems to be missing it . 
  not significantly . 
  was n't the best and was n't the worst . 
  the spanish empire might take that title , at least in the league of 17th and onward european empires . 
  however i might be bias , as in i 'm not at all ashamed of the empire . 
  i 'm by ** no ** means proud of it . 
  i just think that we were n't any worse than literally any one else . 
  the people we * enslaved * were n't saints . 
  i 'm just sort of indifferent to the whole thing . 
  it shows what we can achieve and that 's all there is to be proud of , nothing else . 
  however there are other little things that we can be embarrassed about . 
  they 're not huge * in the scheme of things * but they are there . 
  you guessed it https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=incirlik&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wl&amp;authuser=0, 
  [ here 's the full article ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/01/21/protests-in-turkey-as-nato-missiles-arrive/ ) i really do n't know what they 're protesting about . 
  if ireland all of a sudden started becoming volatile and occasionally throwing shells into ni or the mainland uk i would n't mind having nato back up on the borders . 
  ( fyi , i live in england ), 
  we could all argue until the end of time whether austerity is the best option or not . 
  major economists and bank governors have varying opinions . 
  all the experts have varying opinions . 
  there is obviously no answer which is definitively ( based on what we know ** now * ) correct . 
  as that is the case i do n't see the point in us two , here , on reddit arguing whether austerity is the best cause of action . 
  based not on what i know , but who else believes it and their success record i believe that austerity is a * suitable * course of action . 
  there 's probably a better course of action out there , however we do n't know what that course is and we might as well stick with some thing we have reasonable confidence in . 
  i think that in this case angela merkel , sir mervyn king , george osborne , the internation monitory fund , the european central bank headed by mario draghi are correct . 
  simply because * many * of them have proved their worth in economics better than i think any redditor has . 
  no offence , but i 'm going to agree with them over you any day . 
  chances are nether of us are economists and most of them are . 
  they seem to think it 's a good course of action and the argument set out convinces me . 
  there 's no point me reading the fine print of the economics because economics is a huge subject that it would be silly to pretend some one who is untrained can understand . 
  this is why i believe what i believe . 
  i hope it is a convincing case . 
  there 's some thing to be proud of because by doing all of those regrettable things , greece has mannaged to stave of making it happen to the entire currency union of a few hundred * million * people instead of greece 's relatively minor population of a few single millions who would , if this austerity was not implemented , be in * even worse * shit than austerity is inflicting upon them . 
  it 's like chemotherapy . 
  horrible . 
  you ca n't say it 's nice , however you can still be happy that it 's working . 
   fox is open about its biases that 's very commendable . 
  i , and many others , like that . 
   proud of them , which is a good thing i * really * would n't consider being proud of your biases to be a good thing . 
  acknowledging , yes . 
  but thinking bias is * good * : no . 
  i still do n't hate on fox news or even the sun before i actually read what they have to say . 
  when i have read it i usually find a lot more ambiguousness or misleadingness than most , but often not what people who have n't read it are giving credit for . 
  fox earned its bad reputation and deserves it , however some people ca n't see passed a reputation which is n't admirably ether . 
  watch them turn that boat around when they actually have to start making the `` in/out '' decision should it come to that . 
  no one 's suggesting merging national identities . 
  however all the big players in the eu are suggesting a federal structor . 
  federalism does n't mean national identities need be abolished , however national governments would become subordinate . 
  also , i propose the federation of europe exceptional ambition . 
  because i think feea sounds pretty cool . 
  it 's like fear . 
  *** fear us *** . 
  you forgot to put in a couple of things in your sentence . 
  let me fix it  labour and the conservatives have almost exactly the same policy on europe ** and other fucking thing ** it was kind of nice when you had a choice between mild socialism and economic liberalism , even if i did n't really agree with ether . 
  now you just get the same things said by different people . 
  * sigh * edit : spelling, 
  yeah the map is completely retarded , i agree . 
  only about five of the movements have a chance of becoming independent this decade . 
  the original purpose was just to show how silly it would be to let all the separatist movements succeed , however it did a bad job by being too wide encompassing . 
  they 're not that stupid .
