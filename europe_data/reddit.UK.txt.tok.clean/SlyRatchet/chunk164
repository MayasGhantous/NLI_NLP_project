  seriously , borrow them and find out . 
  they 're a very quiet lot . 
  do n't take a lot of work . 
  c'mon , just for a few decades ? 
  ireland 's been wanting them forever now !, 
  plz ? 
  when there 's nothing else to talk about it 's * the eu * scottish independence in ascending order of importance . 
  however nether is usually very well explained . 
  at the minute though ? 
  * snow !, 
  ( most important by a long way ) * pm 's speech on future relationship with eu * north africa being a mess with french intervention and algeria hostage crisis . 
  * and all royal news goes under one blanket : kate baby , prince harry on tour in afghanistan , royal succession and the queen having blocked bills in parliament . 
  did you here about berlusconi ? 
  i 've heard he 's a big deal in italy . 
   eu 's presidency after ireland that 's a big deal ? 
   what now , that economy is booming again the fuck !, 
  some where in the europe is actually doing good economically ? 
  what about [ this ? 
  few hundred years . 
  might happen than . 
  mostly i 'm with koleye on this , but wanted to make the point about over stretching one 's self . 
  the union already has far too many member states for its institutions to work as effectively as before . 
  the union is based on consensus , ie every single member agreeing . 
  this was n't tangible occurred regularly during the early days of the union when it was less than ten countries . 
  recently it has expanded dramatically to include a much wider array of countries which in retro spect was probably a mistake . 
  if anything , at this point we should be kicking members out rather than letting new ones in . 
  kicking members out is , however , inhumane so impossible . 
  if we are to consider having new members such as those from the balkans we 'll need to reform the system of decision making . 
  at the moment it is becoming incredibly difficult and would probably flat out break if there were more than 27 members . 
  tl ; dr we ca n't have all those other countries because the eu is already too big and needs to be fixed . 
  then , maybe it can be considered . 
  maybe . 
   i 'm guessing that people are just of an age that they do n't know any different . 
  you 've mentioned arrogance in this thread already and i agree that it should be avoided . 
  assuming that members of the other side are misinformed is quite arrogant . 
  members of both sides are guilty , however that 's not excuse to keep doing it . 
  you 'd be amazed how well informed both sides are and should refrain from assuming they 're misinformed until they are explicitly proven wrong on an item of ** undebatable fact ** and nothing less . 
  this guys for europhiles and eurosceptics . 
  assuming the opposition are just idiots is to alienate them , make them impossible to empathise with and ultimately ruin any chance of coming to an understanding . 
  umm , where are you getting this definition from ? 
  people having knowledge of the system has little to do with the system . 
  yeah , knowledge of the system is very important and i think it 's irritating that so many people are ignorant , however that 's eu citizens fault and not the eu . 
  if people * choose * to remain ignorant of a core institution than that 's their choice . 
  choosing to get rid of an exceptionally useful * democratic * institution because people are too lazy to bother to understand it is ludicrous . 
  direct understand of the system is n't even necessary . 
  most people are almost completely unaware of how their national governments work and yet we 're not proposing to remove them . 
  we elect politicians who know more about the system of government than we do and as a result get much more out of it than we do . 
  that 's why we elect instead of using full democracy where every one votes on every thing ( well part of the reason ) . 
  i know that feel . 
  my neighbour 's always voting in elections . 
  me and him have nothing alike . 
  completely different worlds and the street is our border . 
  ** the british empire never sleeps ** ^ ( or rests ) ** !, 
  i 'm perhaps not the best person to answer this as i do n't think it 's undemocratic but generally when i 've brought it up with such people they claim that it 's because of the head of the european commission and because it allows ( say if you 're romanian ) for politicians from different countries ( such as germany ) to influence what policies affect you . 
  personally i see no problem with habig * appointed * members of government , such is the european commission as it allows for us to elect people who represent our * interests * but also have more technical knowledge than we do . 
  as for the politicians from different countries thing , i have more sympathy with . 
  they would make the argument that we 're very different from all other europeans and as such have different interests . 
  they would see it similarly to letting politicians who represent chinese people living in china be represented in our parliaments . 
  it 's also worth noting that * some * ( by no means all or even a majority ) of people who hate the eu for the democratic reason are n't fully aware of it 's workings . 
  agreed . 
  france , spain , portugal , the netherlands , denmark , belgium , ect all had empires and most of those guys make up the backbone of the eu and europe . 
  however iceland , ireland and scandinavia tend to be a little more separate ^ ( not as much as the uk , but still ), 
  i really do n't think he was making out anything more than britons thinking themselves as not european or as separate to it . 
  what he/she said was just quite an interesting little way of making that point . 
  it 's not snarky . 
  we think of ourselves as not of europe and we 're not exactly wrong for thinking that . 
  we are an island and we have a different , less integrated history because of it . 
  ether way , i think using the word `` obviously '' in `` he was obviously implying '' is a bit of a stretch as you seem to be the only one making that connection . 
  additionally , i really do n't think it was necessarily a negative comment . 
  i do n't think he was trying to be negative or sneering . 
  he was merely commenting on the fact you ( and a majority of others ) tend to make the distinction that britain is not in europe ( which is valid ) . 
  there does n't seem to be that much said in multubunu 's comment , just pointing out that you make that distinction . 
  maybe you can draw some thing of his character based on that but it would seem a rather tenuous task . 
  even if some one ( such as a non british european ) were to make a semi-negative comment on this thread , that does n't mean that person is an ambassador of europe and should try to make sure good relationships are kept between him , his country and other countries and people . 
  we do n't need every one in europe to treat us nicely so all british people feel loved and integrated for anything to work . 
  europeans are generally nice people ( most people on earth are generally nice people ) and we have no problems getting on with them on the whole in a similar way to how i have no problem getting on with fellow britons on the whole . 
  tl ; dr ( that is the acronym is n't it ? ), 
  he did n't make a snarky comment . 
  even if he did , it would n't have mattered . 
  i did n't say it was hard to make the jump . 
  i did so that it was an illogical jump . 
  just because there 's a very prominent example of a federation does n't mean we 're going to try and emulate that example whilst ignoring all others . 
  it 's an easy jump , but it is n't extremely logical so should be avoided . 
  perhaps because we in the west hold our leaders at a less glorious level ? 
  back in the day it used to be `` the president/queen is the most amazing person ever and must be treated with respect '' . 
  now we analyse their flaws and treat them like humans and only give them so much respect and gratitude as they deserve . 
  the most gratitude a western leader can almost ever reach is having children named in your honour . 
  tony blair in the balkans is the only other example i know of . 
  it 's not some thing to scoff at . 
  i think the `` sage '' around austria might be slightly different . 
  i subscribe to r/polandball and they have * a lot * of in jokes such as israel being a cube instead of a ball because `` jewish physics '' . 
  austria also has some strange in joke behind him that i do n't understand . 
  so he does n't * particularly * dislike this thread . 
  he just dislike every thing . 
  they all have a lot of shared culture and history which means their national symbols tend to be very similar . 
  a prime example of this is sweden , norway and iceland 's flag . 
  they 're all like slightly more complex versions of the danish flag . 
  denmark being the former colonial power in those countries . 
  kind of similar to how that crescent moon appears on a lot of islamic country 's flags or why a lot of african countries tend to go for that odd shade of green . 
  hope this helps .
