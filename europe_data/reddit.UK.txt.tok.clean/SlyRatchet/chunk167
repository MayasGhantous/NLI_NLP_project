  there are a lot of charities out there who 's hearts are in the right place but their brains just are n't quite as right as their hearts are . 
  they 'll try to ` do the right thing ' even if that means misleading people who going to an institution which really has no business doing what they 're suggesting . 
  you make good points but even though there is a non nationalisation way of reading it , it is still poorly worded . 
  i would need it to be expanded up more by some one directly connected and accountable to really be certain of what i would be signing , which is admittedly a shame . 
   if nationalisation was the survey 's goal , it surely would have been stated . 
  you 'd think that , but you really ca n't trust things based on `` well they should tell you '' . 
  you have to interpret these things yourself . 
  petitions are n't allowed to lie about what they 're doing , but they can be ** very ** misleading if they want to be . 
  if you think all it wants to do is regulate , how do you explain the word `` provide '' ? 
  in my mind the statement that comes from kind of states that it it advocates nationalisation . 
  edit : sloppy grammar . 
  a word ended up in the wrong place `` all '', 
  regulation does not equal nationalisation . 
  i agree with you there . 
  however `` providing '' pretty much does mean nationalisation . 
  i do n't see what else the petition would , in the long term , be advocating . 
  i think having standards fixed across the eu is a good idea , but that really does n't seem to be what they 're suggesting . 
  yea i read it ... and i quoted it  the eu legislation should require governments to ensure and to ** provide ** all citizens with sufficient and clean drinking water  water supply and management of water resources ** not be subject to ` internal market rules ' ** and that water services are ** excluded from liberalisation ** . 
  the petition is very loosely worded which i do n't like . 
  it does n't specifically say what it will do . 
  however it can * very easily * be interpreted as `` all eu states should provide water through a nationalised water system '' . 
  the quotes above show that . 
   the only way you 're getting philip into greece is things get worse and he decides he can buy it back , or if you give him a machine gun and let him spearhead the coup . 
  oh you sent my mind of on an imaginary journey where the uk takes control of greece and we turn the country around in some spectacular way that does n't comprise the entire eurozone and get an lovely piece of the mediterranean . 
  well , if germany ever stops giving huge bailouts ... 
  he kind of dislikes greece now . 
  some thing to do with them trying to lynch him or his family or some thing . 
  i 'm not familiar , but that kind of stuff 'll make situations a bit tense . 
  as an example it 's one of the only places the queen has not been on a royal , * state * visit to . 
  very astute of you . 
  every one else is probably thinking this : what 's up with algeria and brazil ? 
  oh bavaria you . . 
  yeah i 'm quite intrigued as to where the author comes from based on what he 's said . 
   fancy glass bottle you get glass bottles !? 
  surely that should be about 5 times that price . 
  consider yourself lucky !, 
  yeah i do n't know next to nothing about the water situation in neighbouring countries . 
   public ownership of essential services like the water supply , energy supplies , healthcare , telecoms etc. 
  ensures that they 're operated for the public good they are indeed operated for the public good and not for private share holders , however a conservative or libertarian would argue that it forgets the main point of a capitalist system . 
  that point being that when multiple people/companies try to achieve the same goal for their own benefit , it means the standards become better for every one . 
  this dynamic is vacant in a socialist , state owned system . 
  on some fronts it 's worth having a state owned industry any way ( such as health ) and some times it is ( ever heard of a good car that 's come from the ussr ? ) . 
  different people and different countries will have different opinions on where that line should be drawn . 
  i think the line should go further left in the uk , ( to encompass water and rail like it used to but not steel for instance ) . 
  but people who live in different places , as well as literally living in a different economic and literal climate than me will have different opinions on where that line should be drawn . 
  perhaps they believe the line should include the steel industry or perhaps they believe that line should go further right and exclude the water and rail industries . 
  that choice is , and should be , theirs . 
  i have this belief that the truth always comes to the top . 
  if having state owned water industry is ** truly ** the best option i believe we 'll all ** eventually ** ^ ( i did n't say it would come to the top quickly ) make that decision . 
  we should n't force them to make it faster by imposing it on them before they 're convinced it 's the right path . 
  there 's plenty of evidence to the contrary . 
  * head desk * * buys glasses * * edit 's original post to show idiocy *, 
  do n't count on it :p bottled water is already tap water . 
  it 's some thing to do with the sleek of bottled water as apposed to its practicality . 
  stupid , but what can you do ? 
  buying brands instead of products . 
  i 'm a little bit socialist myself . 
  i think rail , water and some other industries should be nationalised in the uk . 
  my beef with this is people trying to impose their thinking on others . 
  say if france has 60 million and tiny little netherlands has 10 million . 
  france is in favour of nationalised water and votes fully in favour . 
  the netherlands hate nationalisation so vote against . 
  poor little netherlands votes fully against nationalisation , but because france with its 60 million votes likes it , they get ti inflict nationalisation on the water industry . 
  they 're not even going to be using the same systems at all . 
  they both have to separately nationalise and keep them separate . 
  why should france get any say in this ? 
  it has no affect on france . 
  this whole hypothetical is what ^ ( i 'm under the impression ) would happen if this petition was to turn into a bill and be passed by the eu . 
  if france wants nationalised water , it should get it . 
  if the netherlands does n't it should n't get it . 
  there 's no need to force what we think are perfectly good ideas onto other people . 
  in some instances inflicting ideas onto other 's is good . 
  some times people are spewing forth hazardous waist into the atmosphere and we all need to act together or maybe some one is using appallingly low standards on the reproduces or work force which makes every one in the eu on a race to the bottom . 
  we should have eu wide standards on those things and a few others , but not this . 
  this is a national issue , not an eu issue . 
  should the referendum come to england , i 'll ask for nationalisation . 
  there 's been a lot of talk saying that he should abdicate immediately in favour of william . 
  i 'd certainly like that . 
  here 's the video incase any one is interested . 
  edit : there was already a link ... :(, 
   being above the law just thought it should be stated some where that the english monarchy by convention * are subject to the law of the land * . 
  the queen gets a royal pardon in the same way the us does but by convention ^ ( which sounds more serious than it is . 
  it 's a constitutional matter ) will not use it . 
  one of the royal 's dogs bit some one once and the queen did n't pardon her . 
  nor did the minor royal expect or request it . 
  this is a convention and so will continue to be so . 
  it 's very similar to the royal assent in that it 's just sort of there without any significance . 
  hmm i 'd disagree . 
  i think humans have a right to water * if they need it * . 
  however if they 're in a position where they can get it themselves they should pay . 
  whether the state provides the water or private companies provide the water . 
  you 're still paying . 
  one is upfront and the other is through taxes . 
  seeing as i 'm paying i might as well * choose * which water i want to buy rather than being stuck with what the government gives me . 
  personally i 'd like nationalised water in my country ( uk ) with private industry on the side incase they think they can stand up to the nationalised behemoth ( if they 're innovative they can ) . 
  however i do n't think it should be imposed upon people . 
  if people such as the homeless or disadvantaged ca n't afford water * then * the government can step in to give them it , along with food and perhaps clothing . 
  however , some one has to pay for that and that will be non disadvantaged tax payers . 
  non disadvantaged tax payers should n't be forced to pay for ** their own ** water ** if they do n't want to ** and ** they make up a majority in the country ** . 
  they should be taxes to pay for the water of those who ca n't afford their own but i 'm not uncertain this is n't already the case or that this petition limits itself to that remit .
