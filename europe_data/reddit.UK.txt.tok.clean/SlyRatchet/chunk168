  i think what this petition is saying is that all water industries across the eu should be nationalised in the same way the health service is nationalised in the uk . 
  i disagree with that as a ** blanket ** principle . 
  yes , i think the uk water industry should be nationalised . 
  but we should n't * force other people to nationalise their own industries * . 
  if they do n't want to do it , why are we forcing the eu to do it ? 
  i have nothing against the eu , infact i rather like it . 
  but this is not the eu 's remit . 
  this is the national government 's remit . 
  i 'm not saying i 'm for the privatisation of water , but it 's worth considering that food is a human right , yet the state has no mandate to feed is . 
  that 's left to private companies because they 're better at delivering to us what we want despite it being * immensely * important that we eat . 
  this seems to explicitly state that providing water should be the job of the state  the eu legislation should require governments to ensure and to ** provide ** all citizens whilst , personally , i think it should i do n't think it 's the eu 's job to tell all its states they should nationalise the water industry . 
  if a state wants to have privatised water industry so be it . 
  if there 's a piece of eu legislation which goes more in the direction of making sure standards of water are kept high across the eu as apposed to making national governments provide water , i 'd be more willing to sign . 
  ahahah very typical . 
  tattooing something onto your body because it looks cool without really understanding or embracing what it means . 
  there 's a set of criteria i have for if i can consider getting a tattoo of something 1 : it 's not too clich\u00e9 ( i 'm not gon na put a girlfriend 's name on my arm ) 2 : it 's genuinely important to me 3 : it 'll continue being important to me 4 : i fully understand * what it is * ( no chinese characters 5 : it looks cool, 
  [ this is pretty much the only other thing i know about marseille . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19690263 ) it 's does n't sound quite ready for all the attention . 
  liverpool did n't exactly have aks running around . 
  but is punishment the best way to convince people that god is the right answer ? 
  is causing pain , sorry and just general punishment the most loving thing god could do ? 
  it strikes me that punishing people because they do n't believe is n't a very nice thing to do . 
  it is n't even moral . 
  some one might think differently , but that does n't make them a bad person or worth inflicting pain upon . 
  even if you do n't believe in circumstance , they could just be an idiot . 
  is punishing idiots or the mentally impaired right or just ? 
  so you think that those who approach the world without the believe in god will , and thus deserve , to be the victims and of injustice ( as well as being the arbitrators of injusticep simply because they are unconvinced by the argument laid before them which may not be any fault of their own but merely fault of circumstance or fault of those tasked with the duty of convincing . 
  am i right in thinking that 's your view point on the matter ? 
  a traditional god as in a single , omnipotent , omniscient and benevolent god ? 
  if that 's the cause , does that exclude atheism or humanism ? 
  they can be extremely righteous groups and both tend to uphold very positive attitude in regard to themselves and how they should interact with the world/universe . 
  what 's your stance on what kind of god is required for `` godliness '' ? 
  i 'd assume that an islamic god would n't be acceptable , am i wrong ? 
  do you honestly believe that ? 
  if so , does godliness require it be a catholic god ? 
  it 's all sealand 's fault . 
  you 're saying that we 're now immoral because we are n't religious ? 
  and that we were less moral before ? 
  might i remind you of the extreme corruption of the church in the 16th century : corruption and decadence so severe that it caused the separation of christendom into the catholic and protestant worlds . 
  ( edit : changing `` have '' to `` of '' because i forgot to proofread ), 
  you 're claiming that no great knowledge was reach during the enlightenment ? 
  that leonardo 's great contraptions were irrelevant ? 
  i 'm also a little lost in your sentence and what exactly you mean by it . 
   it was a moment of ** separation ** of the higher dimension of knowledge in ** favor ** of worldly knowledge . 
  how can you separate in favour of some thing ? 
  by the way you wording that sentence it sounds like you meant replacement rather than separation . 
  probably a little bias . 
  atheists ( and i 'm guilty of this ) tend to see atheism as a good thing . 
  humans also tend to project what they want to see onto things . 
  however i think it 's also worth noting how people who 're very unreligious are still religious . 
  people who passively say `` yeah , i 'm sort of catholic '' go down as catholic as much as the pope does on these maps . 
  until people start declaring `` i am agnostic , atheist or humamist '' they go down as being religious . 
  that 's part of the reason religion maps are n't * that * helpful . 
  nor are religion surveys . 
  but they help a little , ca n't deny that . 
  or awesome in the way your friend getting a university ( college ) degree would be . 
  a moment of improvement . 
  a moment of reaching a great level of knowledge ( or enlightenment ) . 
  not really the same as a body part , being removed . 
  though perhaps you could argue the ignorance is being removed ? 
  many thanks . 
  up votes for you . 
  what the fuck greece ? 
  europe seems to be the most secular and atheist place in the world going at the moment , north/west europe at least . 
  [ interesting map from 2005 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_belief_in_god.svg ) . 
  make of it what you will . 
  remove the common agricultural policy * or * eliminate the strasbourg parliament . 
  i really ca n't decide which i 'd prefer . 
  maybe the french should stop being obstructive and trying to * keep * their better deals instead of telling britain they should n't be trying to get a better deal . 
  if you 're going to criticise ( which i invite you to do , it 's good that we all understand the arguments before us ) please use things which are subjectively true  the union of european socialist republics they 're not socialist . 
  most eu states are right leaning , at least more than the rest of the west . 
  that does n't make them socialists and the eu is n't binding them to become more socialist . 
  if even thing it 's making them become more left wing by having them remove nationalised industry through austerity measures . 
  i up voted you at first because i thought you were beng funny and sarcastic ... oops . 
  i think they tried that in peru and failed miserably . 
  they also tried it in brazil with much more success . 
  however , now the capital city of brazil is hundreds of miles away from most brazilians . 
  they both went for the geographical option and the usa went for the convenience option ( putting it closer to people rather than the mean average of the country ) . 
  anyway , i think new countries can get away with that . 
  they 're all only about two/three hundred years old and were much younger when they made their capitals . 
  they also did n't have many prestigious cities . 
  however our cities are one of the main defining features of the continent . 
  the way they 're so old , so winding . 
  the way they 're all so unique and have so much history . 
  i live in a boring city of one million people and can tell you all about it 's historic significance in wars like the war of the roses . 
  building a new capital would be to undermine the fact we are an old continent , the old world as apposed to ` the new world ' . 
  it 'd be nice to have a more impartial capital . 
  one that does n't serve duel purpose as a state capital , but it 's not really a problem and they 've already sunk some huge amount of money into their legal buildings in brussels . 
  does any one have the political alignments of these parties ? 
  some one was mentioning the idea of a monti-bersani coalition which sounds nice given that it would keep berlusconi out of power ^ ( crosses fingers ) but i ( and probably a few others ) do n't know their political stances well at all ( monti 's a cut-the-deficit , technocrat , is about all i know ) . 
  it 'd be nice to know if those or any other parties are close on the political spectrum so we know if a coalition is possible . 
  i asked what your opinion of the video was . 
  not what your opinion of the eu and germans are . 
  it 's not so much a question of nationality but of what the people want . 
  there is a foreseeable situation where 50 % of luxembourgers ( including the 20 portuguese ) want to become part of portugal . 
  if that happened then they should get what they want , * usually * . 
  well that article sure made me feel shitty by the end, 
  it 's just been two successful , anti european governments . 
  we had ten years of blair 's pro europeanness . 
  anti eu stuff just seems to be what the papers like , so obviously what the politicians do .
