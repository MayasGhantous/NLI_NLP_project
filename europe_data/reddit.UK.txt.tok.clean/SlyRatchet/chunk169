  it wont continue . 
  the uk is probably the most eurosceptic country in there , but we as a populace are n't * that * anti european . 
  truth always prevails , it 'll probably come out in an election or two . 
  i think the caps a much better place to start as they spend as much on making those videos that you call `` propaganda '' as the uk government spends ** deciding ** whether it 's going to continue it 's nuclear program or not . 
  i could go on for a while with waist the uk government makes . 
  they both waist a lot . 
   curvature of cucumbers you do n't honestly believe that do you ? 
  ever heard ofeuromyths ? 
  [ like this site aims to dispel ] ( http://www.facebook.com/euromythbuster?fref=ts ) , and this [ wikipedia article provides an introduction to whilst also explaining the curved banana , sorry not cucumber thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromyth ), 
  we wish we could do the same with scotland . 
  perhaps because there are n't any mountains it gets more sun light than the other regions which do have mountains ? 
  you can see the guy started doing it east of finland but realised what he was letting himself in for . 
  i 'd say that 's a bit of a stretch . 
  saying he is one of `` few '' who care about europeans and that that comes from his honesty . 
  i 'm not so sure . 
  i 'm not saying that he is n't looking out for europeans , but i do n't think he 's the only one and i do n't think he 's necessarily any more honest than the next guy . 
  just because there 's not been a big scandal about him yet and because he spends a lot of his time trying to point out things , does n't mean there are n't things of his own that he is n't pointing out . 
  it 's not so much to do with agreeing with their policies ( i do n't know any of them , apart from him being an eu federalist ) . 
  it 's more about whether you like them personally at all . 
  whilst i probably would n't enjoy talking to him , i think he 's fun to watch in the debates whether or not i agree with him . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  all i know him for is being in the european parliament and disagreeing with farage on * everything * . 
  it 's pretty surprising to see an ex-prime-minister in the eu parliament . 
  very interesting . 
  `` pm '' he was the primeminister of belgium ? 
  well they 've gotten this much into power , and i stand in a pretty similar place to you on the nick clegg still being a pretty good guy . 
  there might be quite a lot of us that think this way . 
  he might just have a chance of staying on . 
   is a pressure group it 's a group of people campaigning for a cornish parliament ** because cornwall does n't have a parliament ** . 
  there 's a lot of things you could argue . 
  you can argue wales is a completely independent , sovereign state ; you can argue the european union is a federal entity , but you ca n't argue that cornwall has it 's own parliament . 
  it does n't . 
  it 's just not true . 
  it has its own parliament ? 
  could you please elaborate in what way it has its own parliament or perhaps link to an article of some kind ? 
  this map is n't supposed to show where independancy feelings are , it 's supposed to show europe 's political borders as they stand today ( or when ever this map as made ) . 
  at the moment catalonia is not independent , nor is scotland which is considerably more autonomous than catalonia so they 're not displayed . 
  and those calls for a referendum in catalonia are still ongoing , infact they may have picked up momentum . 
  well that is the nature of politics , is it not ? 
  we ca n't all agree on things , if we did then there would be no need for politics and the figures that represent political views . 
  this is the only good clip i could find . 
  every thing else is extremely long or indirect , but mostly it 's just this video repeated over and over again in the youtube search engine . 
  the guy is called guy verhofstadt http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m4hexu-tfg, 
   secretly in love what now ? 
  i 'll have you know there 's no room for love in an english heart . 
  there is only room for professionalism , solidarity and looking down on people who do not abide by numbers one and two as well as you do . 
  there this european federalist in the eu parliament who 's nearly as audacious as farage . 
  i like to watch those two argue it out . 
  metaphorical knives at each other 's eye balls . 
  it 's like wrestling they 're so dramatic . 
  she out does bush and bush by miles . 
  [ people might find this interesting for a comparison ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20713380 ) . 
  i find the `` between 2001 and 2011 the ammount of immigrants increased by 3,000,000 '' which means the uk has 300,000 immigrants every year . 
  that little nugget just helps to put the story about spaniards in germany in a little bit of context . 
  not that we 're racist or anything .

  apart from in parts of western europe like spain and italy , it does n't seem that much more convoluted than it already is . 
  [ see ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/europe_flags.png/722px-europe_flags.png ) remember to take into account that you 're probably quite familiar with the this map whilst the separatist map is completely foreign, 
  i think he 's just put on every region which feels ` different ' to the rest of its country and has its own flag . 
  for instance there 's not really any political wing for cornish or welsh independence , but they still get put on there because some times they think longingly about it . 
  costal areas seem to get obscured by mountains less so have more sunlight . 
  i believe that 's why there 's a random patch in central scotland that 's darker than any where else in britain . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the weather is absolutely magnificent . 
  germany and france ( and the benelux , but the author said only two ) . 
  just for the sheer amazingness of having all that power in one place and to see how the different cultures would intermingle . 
  instead of talking about it , i 'll simply go to every thread where the royal baby is being mentioned and make * awwwweeee * noises at the colour of kait 's vomit . 
  ^ ( it is geuinly quite excitung , but i 'll have abit * less * information than * that * ) i 'll be back to a normal sleep pattern by next week . 
  i do n't even know how it happens . 
  you 're watching some youtube videos one minute , replying to reddit comments and bahm 2:45 in the morning . 
  you did genuinly catch me about to head to bed though . 
  i 'll be getting tucked up as soon as this is set , so i can read my book , in bed , for a few hours ... well at least i 'm actually * in * bed . 
  night , catch you in the morning maybe . 
  if it helps , the queen 's doing a good job and i 'm very with her doing what she 's doing , being a symbol , over seeing democracy , ect . 
  ^ ( watch all the monarchists be indifferent and the republicans hate on me ), 
  it certainly does n't make them look professional . 
  there 's a guy called cuntobliterator around here some where . 
  it kinda shows that they have no problem being associated with * that * , ect . 
  usernames : not a window into some one 's sole , but kind of like turning up to a job interview in pajamas or a suit . 
  pssssst , the uk 's pretty free if you want to come inspect it . 
  if you come by , make sure you go with * virgin atlantic * , it 'll help with inspecting our freedom from the get go . 
   \u0ca0_\u0ca0 oh dear ...  ugh , americans i do n't actually mind them . 
  they 'll be genuinely astonished by everything and are frequently ignorant of us whilst we 're knowledgable of them which makes me feel intelligent . 
  they 'll also dote on my accent endlessly forever , which is nice . 
  even if they 're idiots , it 's still a complement and i 'll take them where i can :p i 'm not sure if i * prefer * other ( european ) nationalities ( i certainly do n't prefer americans to them , but not sure if they 're equal ) due to them being a lot more familiar and having richer history of their own leading to less impressedness . 
  otherwise though , it 's a lot funner to compare culture with them . 
  because i do n't actually want you to stop :p if you can prove that portugal 's a good place to live and holiday ( without scamming people ) then you 're just making people 's lives better whilst inadvertently making your country richer . 
  i do the same thing with all of my american friends in the hopes that one day the us will become poor due to americans spending all their money on expensive british exports . 
  stop trying to steal our educated work force !, 
   edit : due to being ignored by the community and the mods , i have decided to convert to islam . 
  i will kebab this subreddit until it redirects to / r/eurabia . 
  unfortunately there 's no islamic flag available . 
  maybe you should make a post to try and get the mods to add the islamic flag . 
  [ i can see computer monitors being thrown the second saint andrew 's cross disappears . . ] ( http://www.suckypoems.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/smash-and-break-computer-pc-monitor-with-keyboard12.jpg ), 
  so no scottish flag ? 
  there was very little chance they 'd have any of their views accepted here and a lot of them knew , or should have known that . 
  the very least they could have done was shut the fuck up rather than get under every one 's skin . 
  might as well rename them * the west burro baptist church * , walking in places and telling them they 're wrong and going to burn in soviet missiles knowing that we 're not going to believe or agree with them . 
  not that i 'm jaded or anything .
