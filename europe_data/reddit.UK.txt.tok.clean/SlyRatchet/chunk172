  in libya it was almost completely a european effort . 
  the us took a relatively small role in that theatre and let the uk and france take centre stage . 
  yes the us was heavily involved , but we do everything as one force now . 
  we all act under nato , together . 
  this is a bit meandering i know , but i 'm sure you understand what i 'm trying to say . 
  well there are people like kandzija who say `` finally someone with some sense here . '', 
  in regards to turkey joining the eu . 
  some pro eu-ers think any one who disagrees with them on the eu to be stupid and to have misunderstood something . 
  which i find kind of disgraceful ^ ( them thinking other 's misunderstood , not people disliking the eu ) . 
  there are a lot like me who think you 're perfectly sane if you do n't like the eu and do n't think it does good . 
  i disagree , but i can perfectly understand where you 're coming from . 
  basically what i want to say is , do n't tar all europhiles with the same brush . 
  there 's a lot of assholes on the pro eu side and the anti eu side . 
  i do n't let me self get too transfixed with hatred for the irritating anti eu-ers and hope they do the same for us . 
  ^ ( sorry for the poor writing ), 
  you had me on your side right up to  you want to share a bit of the ** burden ** , scotland ? 
   they 'd ** breed ** * you out * in a generation . 
  just that word `` breed '' makes me become very uncomfortable . 
  it 's as if you see them as animals . 
  however , i do agree with pretty much everything you said . 
  if a pc person saw what you said ( excluding the last sentences ) they 'd probably still call you racist for not loving all people equal , but i and i think others do see that as a little short sighted . 
  if all of a sudden a five million indonesian immigrants moved to the uk or any eu country , they would be a much poorer educated work force than we have currently ( this goes for all eu states ) and have a lot more that the state needs to provide for . 
  it would hurt the economics and effectively every one in the country . 
  there needs to be some level of familiarity between states for integration to work . 
  i 'm not sure that * is n't * in turkey , so i withhold judgement . 
  i just accept that i would n't want to have , say , iraq in the eu for the reasons described ( as well as others , obviously ) . 
  yeah , but germany 's changed a lot since then . 
  that was pre nazi . 
  it 's not really worth comparing nazi or pre nazi germany to post . 
  they 're world 's apart . 
   geographically speaking , why not . 
  people just use that argument because it 's easier than justifying themselves . 
  i think that 's not completely true . 
  we call it the * european * union for a reason . 
  the goal of the eu ( or ecsc c. 1950 ) was to provide peace , stability , perhaps unity and eliminate war in * europe * . 
  the eu 's remit is not to provide those things for the whole world , as much as it ( we ) would like to . 
  yes , europe as a continent is an arbitrary and some times ambiguous line . 
  however that 's our line which ultimately determines what is european and what is not . 
  it 's unfortunate that one country can be outside there and thus be considerably less likely to join simply because of bad luck of location , but that is indeed a legitimate argument in this instance . 
  the eu 's top goal is not to create unity in the world it 's to create unity in europe . 
  if , geography , turkey is not in europe then it is not part of the main eu objective . 
  however , that wont stop turkey , nor should it . 
  if there 's enough in turkey 's favour in terms of culture , democracy and human rights then there is n't a reason turkey should join . 
  it just ca n't be considered part of the main eu objective because it is n't . 
  it 's part of a wider objective , the objective that necessitates eu states being the largest givers of aid ( per capita ) on the planet . 
  that 's very vaguely where the * ` no turkey in the eu because turkey 's not in europe ' * people are coming from . 
  kinda , sort of . 
  i 'm sorry for all the pro eu , pro turkey people implying and some times saying that any one who does n't think turkey should join is stupid . 
  we 're not all like that . 
  it rather makes my side look naive which is regrettable ... we 're not all so arrogant , i promise . 
  i 'm pro turkey accession and very pro eu , but you 're being a bit strong there . 
  nice to hear something positive about the eu every once in a while . 
  i keep thinking , it 'll all end up ok in the end really . 
  the future 's very uncertain but it 's nice to kind of hear something which says `` yes , it probably will turn out to be ok even if we 're still not certain '', 
  just fyi for any one reading . 
  this guy ( ulemad ) is a known troll . 
  there 's little point talking to him if you take a look at other posts he 's made . 
  if you look at the whole quote  yes i think the us army has a systemic , cultural problem ^ ( look at all the us soldiers peeing on dead taliban and burning copies of the koran ) ** i do n't however think that other countries are that much better ** it 's difficult to say whether one army is any worse behaved than another . 
  i think that the us might be worse because it is this huge organisation which is incapable of standards over all of its soldiers and the same kind of discipline as in other armies . 
  i think other small , but still large armies face the same problem but on a different scale and different proportion . 
  i 'm not sure whether one army is better than another ( in this regard ) , but if i had to pick one i 'd pick the us for its bloated size . 
  that 's an interesting proposition . 
  in that neck of the woods , a state really does need an army . 
  i 'm just skeptical as to whether a ) now is the time for it to have its * own * ^ ( as apposed to what is practically a foreign army made up of au and certain nato troops ) and b ) that they need one trained by the most advanced armies in the world . 
  i guess i could complain ^ ( in that oh so british way ) about how it 's all being done wrong , or how i would do it differently . 
  for me it comes down to , i 'm not sure if i would rather they be doing nothing or this . 
  right now i 'm leaning towards nothing . 
  the whole thing just seems to precarious to be throwing around trained men with guns and expecting it to go swimmingly . 
  they 're different examples , yes . 
  i think it 's very dangerous to claim one can know why things went the way they did in afghanistan ^ ( and by extension why they wont happen here ) . 
  it 's an ** extremely ** complicated and tedious situation now and it was also tedious before . 
  even if some how things are as simple as you make it out , the somali state is incredibly unstable . 
  yes , a standing army will indeed make it more stable , but the army itself is unstable . 
  there 's no predicting the future here . 
  basically , i think that providing more military expertise to a ^ ( let 's be honest here ) fucked up part of the world is seldom a good idea . 
  i do n't think it has to work out badly , as i 've said before , but i 'm skeptical as to whether it 'll work out given passed experiences and this example 's specific situation . 
  is it bad that i feel a sense of national bride that my country uses a lot of internet ? 
  edit : it was just a ^ ( possibly rhetorical ) question . 
  no need to downvote for it : /, 
  i gave him a special troll tag so i know to wish harm upon his anus every time i see it . 
  why go on the computer when you have heroin ? 
  there is n't much heroin in the highlands of scotland . 
  you sure made it look like that 's what you think . 
  i know there 's more people in new york city that have ( or claim ) irish decent than there are in dublin . 
  ^ ( i would like to humbly apologise on behalf of the british for that whole potatoe famine thing which is kind of why the nyc/dublin thing is the way it is , sorrrrrrry ), 
   the british have a wealth of experience with places like northern ireland where the plan was n't just to fight until no one is left standing , but to reform the territory / sarcasm on and we did a great job as is now visible from the state of the magnificent country of northern ireland which is now so perfectly stable i would love to go live its capital , belfast . 
  / sarcasm off ok , ni is n't * terrible any more * , but i would n't like to live there and simply because it 's dangerous . 
  if they did n't have * such * serious riots every 12 months or less , i would n't mind living there , but that 's not the case . 
  basically my point 's that  culturally it appears ( from the outside ) that the us army is not built to deal with other cultures in the same way other armies , that have been involved in recent conflicts , have does n't really hold up imo . 
  yes i think the us army has a systemic , cultural problem ^ ( look at all the ** us ** soldiers peeing on dead taliban and burning copies of the koran ) i do n't however think that other countries are that much better . 
  there is a little bias in me which says obviously the uk and ireland would n't have done such a bad job had they been in the same situation , but i think i 'm probably being bias and even if we would do better , i do n't think we 'd have done * significantly * better . 
  yeah , all whilst i was reading this i though it sounded an awful lot like cold war afghanistan . 
  we know how well that turned out . 
  i do n't think it has to go that way , but it 's not undeserving of worry ether . 
  ( ps if any one has anything as simple ( or simpler ) which is less embarrassing , i would love to know c : ), 
  oh ... you saw that ... 
  please , i do n't actually read it for facts or knowledge or even entertainment !, 
  it 's simply the the easiest to read german site i could find . 
  i use it for practicing my ( bad ) german . 
  believe me , i 'd much rather read die welt or something that does n't have ( i 'm not even joking ) a [ sub catagory entirely for the royal family ] ( http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/royals/royals/home-15702890.bild.html ) or an [ * entire catagory * for `` autos '' ] ( http://www.bild.de/auto/startseite/auto/auto-home-15478182.bild.html ) really not proud about reading the german equivalent of * ` the sun ' * but , well , everything else has too many complicated words :( please , forgive me !,
