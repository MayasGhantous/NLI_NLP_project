  damn straight !, 
  * internet high five *, 
  yay ... more america in europe ... 
  you 're not the first person to say that . 
  any one notice that whoever made that video is obviously a google chrome fan ? 
  [ see ?

  i really do n't think that 's the solution . 
  they have a great thing going/growing with their online videos on youtube and vimeo , but a tv channel would be too ^ ( among other things ) intrusive . 
  or at least people would feel it was . 
  people are very poorly educated on the eu , but they 're also very poorly educated on how their own governments work . 
  i think the solution if for the eu to do a continually good job and continue doing what it is doing : making youtube videos and proving that it is an entity which exists for the betterment of european as well as global humanity , which it is doing reasonable job at ( not gon na lie , could do better ) the eu ca n't make the content itself . 
  it will always be considered bias , even if it is criticising itself severely . 
  others need to present the information to the public and the public need to read/watch it . 
  that 's how things will improve , in my opinion . 
  have you seen the amount of translators they have ? 
  they manage to host giant debates in the eu parliament with seamless translation . 
  at a guess i 'd say there 's over three hundred people in that building . 
  a common language really is n't necessary . 
  just look at [ euronews ] ( http://www.euronews.com/news/europe/ ) . 
  it has all the same content in about ten languages . 
   telegraph or the daily express bitching about the lack of transparency in the eu wo n't link to this portal i could seriously imagine them linking to evidence they found in that portal to show how the eu is n't being transparent whilst not aknowledging the fact they 're using that portal xd, 
   the symbols on the frisian flag are water lily leaves not hearts it 's ok . you do n't have to hide your hearts from us . 
  we 'll accept you whoever you are . 
  oh there 's nothing wrong with them uploading a lot of video . 
  i moderately like it and i thin it singles europe out as a much more modern kind of institution which is trying to harness the power of new technology in ways previously unexplored by governmental institutions . 
  it was just a comment pointing out that the eu does like making videos . 
  not really showing a point of view on that matter , in that post anyway . 
  by all means , use more internet . 
  i look forward to the day we * can * have direct democracy again . 
  the eu really do love to make videos for the internet . 
  guess they want to have lots of family movies when they 're older . 
  there should be a little thing which `` europhiles '' followed by a number on the right hand side some where . 
  just bellow that there should be a little box you can tick to show or not show your flair . 
  there 'll be an example of what your flair is . 
  yours will have nothing on it so you click the button directly after your name which says `` edit '' where you can choose which flag to have . 
  welcome to reddit . 
  you 'll love it :p, 
  i think it 'll get much more intense closer the time . 
  the snp has n't come out with that many policies that can be argued about * yet * . 
  when they do and when the campaigns gets going i imagine the debate will be pretty darn intense . 
  ahh , i 'm sorry that quote makes me look a bit arrogant . 
  i got so caught up in trying to convince ulemad he was wrong in an effective manner that i forgot to check on the other areas of my post xd i would never use those words of i was seriously discussing scottish independence . 
  i do n't think it 's illogical to think that scotland would be better off outside . 
  there 's a substantial body of evidence to point to on that front . 
  however i think that going it alone is incredibly dangerous and no one knows what will happen . 
  for instance the snp has been chanting since the topic of automatic eu membership came up that scotland would get automatic eu members upon independence which as we can now see is not true . 
  there 's also the case of banks . 
  if scotland had been independent when the banking collapse happened i do n't think scotland would have faired well at all , especially if it was outside the eu for instance but then you 're in the same seat as ireland paying gigantic sums of money to the eu for your bailouts , ect . 
  it 's a dangerous world out there and you never know what will come next . 
  when some thing does come , i like to be in a large country with a large economy and ever so critically ** a stable , strong , accountable , transparent , tried and tested form of government ** . 
  i 'm skeptical as to whether an independent scotland would be able to provide that . 
  politics is hard . 
  coming to a consensus is hard . 
  building a country is ** hard ** . 
  building a country well is ** even harder ** . 
  no one knows what challenges alex salmon will face and no one knows what his government will take the form of and no one knows who his successor will be . 
  salmon might be fine , but the next guy might be richard nixon . 
  that 's my ** main ** ^ ( i do have others ) argument against independence . 
  ( sorry if you did n't want to hear it ) edit : fixed parenthesise, 
   they want to segregate could you provide some examples ? 
    well , unless they violate human rights  these nationalisms , especially in flanders and scatalonia , are based on brainwashing , manipulation of the history , and extreme racism . 
  such attitudes are not welcome in the eu . 
  i do n't know why you quote that particular part of my post and then said something completely unrelated , but ok . 
  i would n't go so far as to say '' * brain washing * '' but i 'll concede that the nationalist movements do tend to skew the facts a little , and some times more than a little . 
  there are numerous examples i could find from the snp . 
  i do n't know about catalonia and flanders so much , but it 's not our place to judge how well educated they are . 
  if we think they 're wrong we can think that all we want , but that does n't make them wrong . 
  they might be though , and if they are , they should have the freedom to make a bad , even awful decision so long as they 're not seriously hurting others ^ ( see nazi germany `` hurting others '' ) . 
  if we think they 're wrong , we should try and convince them that we are right and that what they hold to be true is not . 
  we should n't punish them for disagreeing with us . 
  that 's what dictators do . 
  europe , and people will giggle , is not a dictatorship ^ ( stop giggling ) . 
  it 's democratic and respects not only its citizens rights , but also all europeans ' rights . 
  i hope you can be convinced that the most appropriate , legitimate way to stop independence is to convince people and not dictate their lives or punish them for acting on their beliefs . 
   even america who have * no culture and no history ^ ( ( chuckle ) ^ ) * have a north south divide where an element of the south would like independance . 
  the usa is a united , sovereign country which has existed for over two hundreds and i think we can all agree , it 's done a good job of existing . 
  it 's provided a democratic society where the people can elect their leaders and representatives based on merit , it 's provided stability even in the most unstable of times , it 's provided economic prosperity to its systems and to its allies , it is a powerful nation capable of projecting power around the world at an unprecedented and unseen before scale . 
  and yet , it has a north south divid . 
  it has separatist feelings , strong ones too . 
  it achieved all that despite its separationist feelings . 
  using internal divisions is a non argument . 
  there will ** always ** be internal divisions . 
  labour and conservative , republican and democrat , atheist and christian , irish and british , all of these ways of defining people but often they live in the same place , often sharing a nation together . 
  ^ ( fyi 400,000 french expatriates in the uk at the last count . ), 
  we share what we share despite our differences , and we often do it with great results and often even bond over the greatest we some times achieve . 
  it just might , maybe , a little bit , kind of work . 
  we might even bond over it . 
  i do n't think independence is going to be good for any of these nations however , my reasons for that are drastically different to yours . 
   by international laws , a territory can only split up from its country when it 's being opressed , or when the country is ** not democratic ** if they want to be independent it 's their international right to * self determine * that , specifically in a democratic way . 
  if scotland votes in a referendum and a majority of scots want independence then , by democratic , international right their country 's government is obligated to give it to them . 
  to not allow them to become separate would be ** `` not democratic '' ** . 
  i really do think independence for scotland is a bad idea if you look at it from a logical perspective . 
  however i think if a majority of scots want it , we should n't argue with it or penalise them for it . 
  they made a decision that they believe is in their interests and there by it should be respected . 
  we are not the one 's that should be deciding for them or punishing them if we believe they are being illogical or wrong . 
  that 's no one 's job but their own . 
  ^ ( well , unless they violate human rights or try and commit war crimes ect . 
  then it 's the un 's or international criminal court 's , but , that 's besides the point . 
  thought i should point that out so you do n't try and throw it back at me for leaving a loophole ),
