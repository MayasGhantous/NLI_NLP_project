  fine . 
  we 'll just chill here ... with all the cool stuff we could bring to a happy relationship ... alone ... no one to share it with ... faithfully , united kingdom, 
  uk with germany . 
  germany 's rich . 
  they can help pay off our deficit . 
  yeah , if you 're weak and you get stuck next to a big guy , you 're basically obligated to be their friends even if you hate the living crap out of them . 
  look at latin america c. 1900 with regards to the usa and t. roosevelt . 
  there 's other reasons i/we like the idea of a european super state asside from national pride and defence reasons . 
  i think we can get more done in terms of economics , ** science ** ** ^ ( ( europeanspaceagency ) ^ ) ** and you know , do good in the world . 
  the european union states are the largest givers of development aid in the world ( partly because of their eu obligations ) and they are some of the greenest * developed * countries with ambitions to go further . 
  ect . 
  you can see what i mean . 
  careful about how pro eu you are . 
  being pro federation or too doting pisses off * all * the anti eu guys . 
  if we win them over slowly that the eu 's a good institution ( which it is , despite the * euromyths * ) then that we 'd be better off with more europe , then finally they wont explode whenever any proposes the idea of a federal or confederal sort of state . 
  basically , be weary of using hyperbole . 
  eursceptics use it on us , we shall not stoop to that level . 
  that 's nice . 
  all the eu haters kept saying things like `` well what 's the eu gon na do with all that money ? 
  i supposed borroso and rompuy will be getting a bonus '' whilst you 'd expect such criticism it 's nice to see that the eu did some thing genuinely good with the money . 
  no one can really complain that they 're giving it to a cause like this . 
  ok some will , but that 's really kind of nit picking `` cancer research is just as good as helping children hurt by war . 
  should have gone to cancer '' , ect . 
  go europe !, 
  love that we 've ^ ( ( however slowly ) ^ ) gotten stuff done together . 
  this , we should do more of it . 
  looks like we have/are receiving a big wave of positive eurozone news . 
  first greece has its new oil ; gas reserves that were recently found then greece 's credit rating was raised to b , i think it was b anyway ; this article . 
  there 's plenty of negative news to add to the almost never ending supply , but the bad stuff often does n't have a lasting impact and the good stuff generally does . 
  least it makes me feel good about my hope that this wall all blow offer ^ ( vague shawn of the dead reference ), 
  tbh although big organisations can lie to me due to corruption alot more than say , i lie to me , i do still trust s&p over any one on the internet 's opinion and my own opinion . 
  unless you work in economics , your opinion on the matter has almost no credibility and it 's merely uneducated speculation . 
  even if you have a degree in an appropriate field , you 're still not a huge organisation filled with loads of hand picked people with the same or better degrees where the sole purpose of the whole organisation is to determine credit ratings . 
  if you think you can determine credit ratings better than s&p can , you 're , well , i 'm sure you can think of some descriptive word along the lines of na\u00efve or arrogant . 
  most would associate ` miracle ' with biblical events . 
  i do know what you mean however . 
  maybe ` fiasco ' or ` shambles ' are good words . 
  they are used almost exclusively in the case of human errors . 
  but now i am getting very precise . 
  so many words it 's hard to know which ones to use . 
  it 's more that the germans and french seem more socialist than i , a left leaner , feel comfortable with . 
  it 's more to do with saying that i do n't think britain comes off particularly bad on that map because i think the system of wealth distribution we have at the moment is decent ^ ( ( obviously it can be improved . 
  everything always can be ) ^ ) and does n't need to be looked down upon for being the same shade as countries like greece or spain . 
  i 'm not saying fuck equality , i 'm saying meh . 
  i think we have it decent over here . 
   `` ireland , iceland and scotland all have very small populations and relatively weak economies though . 
  that 's why i think they want to join , not for the cultural reasons . 
  that 's why the uk joined , '' you misunderstand me . 
  i left those too sentences far too unclear . 
  i think the * british * ^ ( we 're not ` english ' ) joined for economic reasons . 
  so does the rest of the world . 
  no one is saying we joined for cultural reasons . 
  i just happened to leave that little bit of the sentence unclear . 
  sorry that your explanation was unnecessary . 
  ireland , iceland and scotland all have very small populations and relatively weak economies though . 
  that 's why i think they want to join , to support their own industry and economies , not for the cultural reasons . 
  those are the same reasons why the uk joined , but now people are starting to think we 're not getting so much out of the economic stuff because of all the political costs and the fact big nations have to put more in than they get out . 
  small nations tend to get more than they put in . 
  there 's some gaps in what you 're saying , like christendom being like a single nation state . 
  there 's plenty to argue in that one , like if spain and france were part of the same country , how could they * invade * each other . 
  however , i agree that unincorporated nation states can cause a lot of problems . 
  lots of small countries with all their own armed forces and agendas . 
  sounds markedly like the middle east . 
  i think having fewer much more well integrated blocks would be better . 
  i quite like the eu 's stance on soft power . 
  it 's just better than the americas ` speak softly and carry a big stick ' ^ t.roosevelt mentality . 
  it 's a better source for global peace and it 's a better source of just goodness and happiness . 
  edit : made the first few sentences more precise and clear . 
  this sums my feelings quite well [ click here ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9qjarwd5a84/t3oxhjjbe1i/aaaaaaaaa34/ovtlnvwpmvi/s190/nod-of-approval.gif ), 
   if we prolong austerity long enough , it will work , inequality will disappear because we will be all equal in being poor and ** dead ** . 
  that 's a tad dramatic is n't it ? 
  well i was using a bit of hyperbole . 
  i know a finnoscandinaviannortheuropeanbritishislesunion is never going to happen . 
  we were just fantasising . 
  whilst we 're fantasising about the prospects of some impossible federal union we might as well imagine it in way we like , eh ? 
  some times i wish we were a bit like that , that we had that sort of freedom to just walk or drive to the country next door . 
  like if we were connected geographically to the ** island ** of ireland . 
  if we could do that , if we could juts interact with our neighbours both linguistically and logistically it might create that sort of sense of a european identity for us british . 
  i do see us all as european as well as what ever national identity . 
  i 'm not sure whether they 're both equal in prominence or whether state nationality comes first ( british , ducth , ect ) . 
  i think we share a lot of similar ideas , especially on foreign policy ; we hold very similar culture values ; we share very connected histories and ethnicities . 
  there 's so many reasons we 're alike , yet we 're separated by a channel and to an extent by our limited knowledge of our neighbours . 
  why are we different countries again ? 
  history , mostly . 
  there 's plenty more history to come though and it 's looking a lot more positive than the older stuff where countries keep trying to claim ownership of one another . 
   it would be a miracle ( and a terrible one ) would n't that be known as a tragedy , catastrophe or disaster ? 
  i see what you mean . 
  i suppose if there 's no big consensus across the country then no party 's really going to change it 's stance on europe . 
  they 'll just keep to what they 're doing because it 's negligible whether changing that policy would help or not . 
  it 's very interesting hearing it from your ( a dutch national 's ) point of view . 
  the bbc covered the dutch election at the time in some detail and they were talking about how `` the fate of europe may well rest on this election '' or some thing that means that , but possibly to a less dramatic extent . 
  when the pro eu parties won it was reported as a win for the eu . 
  it 's certainly interesting to see that was n't even really a big deal for you guys . 
  i , as a british pro-european like what you 're saying mostly , with a number of reservations . 
  i think blair summed it up very well at a recent talk . 
  he said something along the lines of `` we 're much better in europe , but stop saying that we 'd fall apart outside . '', 
  which i 've taken to heart . 
  i 'd rather spread completely correct information without embellishment rather than what the eursceptics do which is make up myth after myth . 
  i do also agree most people do n't have a vision for a future united with europe . 
  i do , and i think more people do than you might expect , but we 're a minority .
