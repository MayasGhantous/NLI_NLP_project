  perhaps that would change if the press was n't so , awful . 
  but one can only hope . 
  even with all of that , i 'd like to progress with further integration . 
  if it goes to a referendum i really ** really ** hope people become properly educated and vote with their brains , not their eurosceptic , myth spewing newspapers . 
  i read an opinion poll a while ago . 
  if i remember correctly about ^ very-roughly 50 % of people in ukraine say they 'd like to join and the number 's rising fast . 
  do n't forget the british isles !, 
  i 'm almost as eursceptic as they come over here ( pro integration , just not quite * now * . 
  maybe in a year , or three ) and i would bloody love a north-west union . 
  all the strong germanic language countries ( + finland , screw france ) . 
  the romance language countries can go it alone , and maybe keep the eastern european/slavic countries . 
  we could all work so well together ... 
  it would be the happiest open relationship ever !, 
   the dutch do n't think that it 's a great idea to transfer power , the politicians do did n't the big pro europe parties win in the last dutch election ? 
  i disagree with you on many levels . 
  a ) according to your rant the usa does n't actually interfere with people 's lives or take liberties . 
  it just monitors them on the internet . 
  b ) your dramatisation is both wrong and it 's disgusting to think that people genuinely people western citizens behave like that . 
  c ) knowing to what extent your country monitors you , especially on the internet , is a pointless exercise , especially if you try and rank them . 
  the real police states do n't let you know what they 're doing and nether do the non police states for national ( and might i add , very good ) security reasons . 
  so it 's impossible to know what they 're actually up to which means you 're simply speculating which is bad because you 've based a very large opinion on that . 
  the usa does not interfere with its citizens lives anywhere near as much as almost any other country in the world dos ( apart from somalia , but that 's for entirely different reasons ) . 
  i 've been saying this for a while now . 
  not to mention most people who vaguely understood the eu would have known that there was something fishy about the snp 's claim . 
  this makes me sad . 
  i 'm actually in support of ** america 's ** ( the usa 's ) gun laws in ** america ** . 
  i think it would be stupid here in britain or even on the continent . 
  we have faith in our police services and their ability to protect us . 
  we also do n't have big black markets , specifically , no demand for weapons whether illegal or not . 
  in america every one has a gun and there 's crime on an even larger scale than in europe ( not saying we do n't have large scale crime ) . 
  if people in america do n't have guns they are genuinely vulnerable because the state is a lot less able to protect them than in the eu . 
  if the usa made guns illegal with a blanket ban and huge punishments , there would still be guns everywhere . 
  the usa does n't interfere with individuals lives to the same extent as in european countries meaning the usa ca n't monitor its civilians and tourists closely enough to keep illegal guns out . 
  the logical conclusion is to give other people guns too . 
  there by making the guns that criminals have less effective . 
  there 's just no solution to america 's gun problem . 
  you ca n't get rid of the guns and letting every one have them makes every one marginally more safe . 
  that 's why they do what they do . 
  there are other bad reasons they do it aswel . 
  such as wanting to have the ability to over throw the government ... oh and because it 's their `` god given right '' or something . 
  those are bad reasons , but they only need one good reason which they have . 
  now if they could start applying that same logic to other things ... like cannabis ... 
   `` unprepared for nuclear attack '' who the hell is prepared for a nuclear attack ? 
  there 's not a place on the planet that is , why do you expect the a new battlefield to be ? 
  but how did they pay for the other one ? 
  good for them . 
  should have done it from the start * really * but better late than never , unless it 's already too late . 
  ( * crosses fingers * ), 
  you 're both kind of wrong and kind of right . 
  it 's silly to call the eu undemocratic because two of it 's bodies * are * in fact directly elected by citizens . 
  the only reason you 're calling it undemocratic is because of this deal with the european commission . 
  it 's extremely similar to the house of lords . 
  the lords are appointed by the executive . 
  they are not voted on . 
  i do n't agree with the lords system fully , however i think the principle of appointing rather than electing is an excellent one . 
  you elect people to represent your interests and those people then determine who is intelligent enough to fill the second chamber of parliament . 
  you could argue that it is not like the house of lords because the lords are appointed by the executive where as this is the other way around . 
  the legislature appoints the executive . 
  ultimately it comes down to if you 're ok not ** directly ** electing your representative . 
  i and many others are ok with that . 
  i even think it 's a very good idea . 
  you can argue that the eu commission ( however not the entire eu ) is unelected and you 'd be sort of right . 
  however you ca n't argue that it 's not democratic because it 's still the people who the citizens voted for who have all the power . 
  you have right to be uncomfortable with not directly electing the eu 's executive , however it makes me feel safer knowing that smarter men ( and women ) than myself are deciding . 
  not just smarter than myself , but also smarter then people less smart than me . 
  if you catch my meaning :p, 
  does any one know what this jargon means exactly ? 
  initially reading it i thought it meant that the eu was n't even considering them joining which i thought odd as they 're on the enlargement agenda , then i realised that `` accession talks '' is some kind of very specific thing rather than a broad term . 
  any one have a link or explanation ? 
  it 'd be much appreciated , 
  in the eu 's eye that does n't make it any different . 
  when they wrote that they did n't just think that if part of one country became independent that that region would just appear out of no one . 
  they knew it would probably have political boundaries from before . 
  if a region is going to become independent , it 's probably a province , country or state ( land ) of that region . 
  just because the uk happens to give its component parts the name country , does n't mean they get special privileges . 
  we call them countries , that does n't make them sovereign states with any special rights . 
  your problem with giving the prize to organisations is that they might not be good forever ? 
  how is that not true for people ? 
  if anything people are more susceptible to changing with time than organisations . 
  the red cross deserves a nobel peace prize . 
  i dont think that 's worth arguing about . 
  a ) '' * clearly * '' ? 
  not necessarily . 
  less than 50 % of scots voted in the snp election because they did n't think voting in second order elections was important . 
  so it 's not * clear * that a majority of scots want to not participate . 
  b ) i do n't agree with the rest of your statement ether . 
  there 's a whole branch of philosophy based on how humans consent to being governed . 
  it 's not like any of us ever signed a contract and said `` i want to be part of nationality x '' yet we still have to follow nationality x 's laws . 
  i 'm not a 100 % willing participant as there are certain things i dont want my tax money to go to . 
  i 'm getting off topic . 
  i 'm not saying you 're entirely wrong and i do think that if the voter turnout is high enough and there is a majority in favour if independence that scotland should get that independence . 
  i just think that there are wholes in your logic . 
  ( ps take a look at the polish corridor . 
  it kind of throws a metaphorical spanner into the idea of self determination ), 
  i do n't know why you 're arguing with him . 
  you should go argue with borroso . 
  he 's the one that says scotland ca n't join immediately and has to go through the process as a new state ( and the uk does n't ) . 
  the debate on whether scotland gets automatic accession has been finished . 
  we have an answer and there 's no point debating it . 
  so you have to be identical to be in a political union ?
