  people in different parts of sheffield to me ( i live in sheffield ) are radically different . 
  some of them come from other continents and speak different native languages and do n't fit in at all . 
  i still have no problems sharing a country with them . 
  there 's plenty of it to go around . 
  because some english people are dicks ? 
  that 's not a very good reason . 
  some of my colleagues are complete assholes but i do n't declare independence from them . 
  if they were all assholes i might consider it , but only like two are . 
  they just happen to be vocal . 
  anyway , they work in a different department and i do n't see them that often . 
  i just get the impression they give my company a bad name . 
  still not reason enough to do anything about it . 
  there 'll always be assholes to contend with whether i work there are some where else . 
  i am on the * `` aetheistan is an idiot '' * side of this debate but i think it 's worth pointing out that the united kingdom would not have been able to invoke nato because it specifically states that it will only defend nations in europe . 
  that clause was added specifically to stop the uk and france from using nato to protect their overseas protectorates . 
  nato probably would have been appropriate in this instance however it would n't have been allowed to act nor did it . 
  the argentines probably knew this . 
  do n't worry . 
  there are many other reasons aetheistan is wrong . 
  i know . 
  i do n't know why you 're telling the snp are are the party in power . 
  if some one does n't know that then they do n't know enough to discuss scottish independence . 
  i thought i demonstrated that i know a thing or two about it . 
  anyway . 
  when i said ** or at least to the level it so desires `` the euro '' ** i put `` the euro '' in quotation marks to indicate that they would not want to join it . 
  not that they would . 
  i know i left that fairly ambiguous but it did n't warrant any more time explaining . 
  scotland 's currency is an interesting issue non the less . 
  speculation is both unlikely to be accurate as the situation and motives are so complicated ; and speculation is also unnecessary . 
  or perhaps he read the treaties in detail and determined that every thing he said was true so decided it best to share that with the scottish government and the scottish electorate . 
  you know . 
  so the snp will stop spreading misinformation ie ** lying ** . 
  i do n't care whether madrid asked him to do it or not . 
  the fact is that is explicitly how eu law dictates something like this goes about . 
  he has n't used a liberal or incorrect reading of the treaties . 
  he 's used a proper one and this is the conclusion . 
  unfortunate for scotland and catalonia , but unfortunately independence was never going to be easy . 
  i am sorry , but that is the way the eu works irregardless of whether madrid or london asked for it to be so . 
  i think you 're right . 
  spain 's suggested it 'd veto scottish independence . 
  london has n't ( nor will it ) repaid the gesture . 
  no , it 's not just a formality ... 
  it would genuinely take years for scotland to gain full eu representation and involvement ( or at least to the level it so desires `` the euro '' ) not only that but it could be rejected due to financial issues like the sovereign debt being too large in comparison to gdp or maybe even the government not being transparent enough to join given that it is effectively a completely new government system . 
  even if scotland does n't rejected for all that , it could be vetoed by spain or belgium to quell separatism in their own countries . 
  these are a lot of ifs , but the whole scottish independence thing so far has been a lot of `` if this then this , probably , maybe , not 100 % sure , but probably '' . 
  they have very little hard evidence that things will go well , and from the looks of things , it * could * go catastrophic . 
  yes , and i 'm ( we 're ) not the only one ( s ) . 
  this has been argued so many times on so many threads . 
  yes there are other contributing factors at work but the eu is central to all of those factors . 
  if we had nato but not the eu we 'd probably have had a much bigger war in europe than the ones we have had ( balkans ) . 
  however , if we had the eu but not nato , assuming that we did n't get invaded by the soviets or something along those lines , we would still definitely not have war in europe . 
  nato ensures that we do n't get invaded from outside ( the russians ) . 
  the eu ensures peace between eu states . 
  it makes war completely impractical and practically impossible . 
  whilst i agree with you that timing is very important , i disagree a little , not a lot though . 
  i think it 's less of a motivation prize and more of a reminder . 
  whilst i 'll concede that what 's going on in europe culturally partly because of the union is bad , i will say that compared to the napoleonic wars , world wars i and ii and all the others which could * potentially * be going on right now the union 's still obviously a very good force for peace , despite some racist/nationalist tendencies it may be provoking now . 
  / sarcasm / damn , we should revoke the red cross 's nobel peace prizes . 
  those cunts . 
  taking a peace prize . 
  it should know better . 
  it 's not a person so it obviously does n't deserve it .

  i 'll never understand why they do that ... 
  i think it depends what you were going in there expecting . 
  i was expecting it to be about thatcher personally rather than politically . 
  it 's very surprising to empathise with a prime minister , let alone thatcher . 
  they 're normally so focused on the job and on arguing , and on being spun by the press that they look completely inhuman . 
  if you actually want to learn from it , it 's bad . 
  however it does give you a good sense of what it 's like to be a member of government, 
  tomato , to \u2022 mata :p, 
  ( british ) me too ... people who say they want the uk to leave but stay in the single market like norway and switzerland do n't really account for the fact that 'll be playing by the same rules but just not taking part in making new one . 
  i 'd rather take part in making new ones for the sake of all europe , otherwise it 'll be austerity , austerity , austerity , at least until turkey accedes to shift the parliament 's balance . 
  nationalism + 1, 
  personally i 'd ask some one really basic questions just to see what they answer . 
  ie * do you think greece can overcome this crisis ? 
  * when ? 
  * how closely to you expect to participate with geramny ? 
  * are you going to try and increase trade with non eu countries like turkey , egypt and russia ? 
  my one technical question would be * what are your plans and estimations for the possibly gigantic oil reserves found in greece ? 
  i 'm not the most well informed on this sort of stuff so if * i * was a journalist there i 'd just be trying to get good sound bites . 
  however i know it 's much more valuable to ask them * real * technical questions like ` are you going to use the troika in this infinitive way like famous economist x said would be good ' or something . 
  but i do n't have the knowledge to ether pose that question or understand the answer . 
  so , sound bites and their ( fairly ) honest opinions on stuff . 
  thanks . 
  ( ps please ask the one about oil ), 
  i watched the iron lady the other day which is a film about margaret thatcher from when she first got accepted into oxford , through her time as mp , minister for several ministries and finally being primeminister . 
  it 's also set in the present day ( or close enough . 
  i think it was released in 2007 ) with thatcher looking back on her passed . 
  it 's not as much about the politics as you might think , but as an as-government & politics student i can tell you the impression it gives on how government and politics works in the uk is spot on right down to the jeering and jives in the house of commons . 
  that could work . 
  how many different notes are there ? 
  you could split it into 4 different professions ( i imagine there are about four notes , 5,10,20,50 ) however , i think part of the point of having symbolic people of europe . 
  setting aside their national identity a little in favour of a greater european perspective . 
  that 's kind of the point of having common things for all european ( union ) nations . 
  to share in a greater sense nationalism and stuff .
