  i 'm not so sure . 
  i think he would be slightly controversial as a war time leader and because he 's so associated with the british . 
  but aside form him being an advocate of european integration , europe would n't have been brought out from under the reach of nazi germany without him . 
  it would n't have happened without the americans or the russians ether . 
  you kind of needed all three to really secure victory . 
  it might still be controversial to have symbol of anything good about the war ( good being the fact that the ` right ' side won ) due to most europeans having almost nothing but shame . 
  all european countries aside form the uk were ether party to the axis or failed to defend themselves ( poland , france ) or remained neutral and shut their eyes to the atrocities ( every one else ) i think i 'm straying from the point a little . 
  the allies were obviously a ` correct ' side which secured the kind of europe we have today . 
  obviously a good for all europe because fuck nazism . 
  so i think it might be appropriate in this case . 
  i mean , no one does n't like churchill , right ? 
  if you think there should be some one from every country . 
  if the uk was in the eurozone i would n't mind not having british people on there at all , so long as there are a lot of people on there who have a right to be . 
  i 'd hope other nationals would feel the same . 
  it 's about the individuals not the countries they come from . 
  part of being part of the greater european family . 
  we britons already have faces on our notes ( ps will prince charles start appearing on our money when he becomes ` king charles ' ? ), 
  but i 'd find it interesting to have supra national variations on euros which do have people on . 
  for instance , i think beethoven and einstein should have a place there , as well as maybe winston churchill ( and that 's not just because he 's british ) . 
  but that 's just what i think . 
  what i think would be infinitely more useful would be figuring out criteria for putting people on the currency . 
  for instance if they did good for all ( or at least most of ) europe then they could be considered for placement on the euro that 's why i included churchill . 
  defeating the nazi 's seems pretty good to me and you ca n't have roosevelt or stalin cause they 're not eu , at the moment anyway ;p i do n't think brussels should try and make sure all nations are represented . 
  some nations have a lot of notable people and some have known . 
  i do n't think you could name a famous kosovoan ( as in of kosovo ) can you name ? 
  i do n't think even a historian of kosovoan history could find a person important enough to put on all variations of the currency . 
  ( no disrespect meant to kosovoans , but there 's just not many of you . ),

  129/196 = 66 % i thought i was good at cartography :(, 
   i appear to be the only brit not feeling the french vibe . 
  sorry guys but i do n't see it . 
  i think we have better relationship with ~ ~ australia ~ ~ austria * ( ? ), 
  than any european one ( even though it 's outside the scope of the question ) edit : however ido agree that i do n't feel the french vibe . 
  never really have . 
  they 're a neighbour but there 's not a lot in common in terms of culture , as is the case with all romance countries . 
  trust me . 
  i know many people who would pick up on a mistake if they think you got the terminology at all wrong without considering that it 's a controversial issue . 
  personally i think we should both just stop looking at specifically what terms people use and saying `` oh look !, 
  bias and incorrect ! '', 
  which happens * all the fucking time *, 
  yeah , but tbh , no one would vote for the uk . 
  we come bottom every year so no one blames you . 
  we meet again my friend :p, 
  any one else notice that all the north africa countries seem to have what look like their german names as apposed to their english ones ? 
  it 'd be so odd if english was the ( singular ) official language of the eu ... 
  i just ca n't imagine all of the eu having a common language ... maybe that whole federation thing might not sound so stupid if there was a common language ? 
  yeah * in theory * it should get back in pretty quick as atm it fulfils all the appropriate criteria . 
  however , what if there is a snag some where down the line ? 
  i think the problem this raises is that there is a lot more that could go wrong and there 's already quite a lot that could . 
  china 's pretty rich , no ? 
  i definitely agree on that front . 
  much better than the previous one . 
  i 'd put it infront of the eursceptics and argue that it 's true and what the outcome of that truth should be . 
  maybe it 's because if you do one bit of russia then you 're obligated to do all of russia ... 
  i 'd avoid that job like the plague . 
  only about 1/8 of the country is even in europe . 
  if you 're aware of the proper history of the eu you 'll know that when the eu was formed it was called the european coal and steel community or ecsc . 
  the ecsc regulated the production of coal and steel ( obviously ) which were considered the essential ingredients for war . 
  without those ingredients , war could not take place and it has n't taken place between members of the ecsc since . 
  you can say `` oh it 's the americans threat of invasion and their nukes that keeps europe in a state of piece '' however that just does n't hold up to historical scrutiny . 
  america dominated and restricted germany in a similar way as it did at the end of wwii . 
  obviously after wwi it all happened again because that was the nature of europe . 
  if europe has nothing to bond over it wont bond , and when europe does n't bond , it fights . 
  let 's not forget that before wwi which was almost named ` the great war ' came not many years after another ` great war ' , the napoleonic wars . 
  france and germany have been at each other 's throats for most of history and that 's never changed until after 1945 . 
  what happened after 1945 that did n't happen after 1918 ? 
  the eu did ( and do n't say the un , there was the league of nations before that . 
  do n't say nato ether because there were similar military alliance ( s ) both before and after wwi . ) . 
  i 've made my argument for why the eu is the main reason there 's peace in europe . 
  feel free to try and poke holes in it . 
  i look forward to seeing what you come up with . 
  ok you seem a lot less crazy now . 
  but i do offer a piece of advice . 
  when you `` the eu is the only progressive force in the world '' why not instead say `` the most progressive force in the world '' . 
  it sounds much more feasible and i agree with that . 
  saying it 's the only one just kind of undermines you and makes it look like you have a lot of contempt for other places . 
  the usa for instance , is making great leaps in terms of progressiveness in the feel of drug laws ( specifically , limited drugs laws , or at least starting to . 
  definitely progressive ) i get irritated too when people do n't see how great this union is and all the good it 's done . 
  people will say nato or the council of europe are what made these 60 years of peace in europe happen , but i would disagree . 
  they helped , but it was the eu that did it . 
  however , when i try and convince people that this union ** is ** fantastic and worth keeping and worth protecting , the last thing i want to do is scare them off . 
  i want to win them over and use a lot of logic to do it . 
  i use a little bit of idealism here and there , but people tend to think you and your idea are crazy if you just spout the idealist stuff . 
  anyway , looking forward to our next 60 years of peace !, 
   failed eurozone experiment it has n't failed . 
  it 's actually a very unclear issue as to whether it ill fail or not . 
  the value has been holding strong ever since the crisis started . 
  all eu and eurozone countries seem committed to solving their problems and reforming . 
  however there are indeed many problems they need to fix and it 's unclear whether they can be fixed . 
  this is an extremely complicated issue . 
  there is no clue future ahead . 
  so stop acting like you know the future . 
  the only wrong answer is `` this will definitely or ** definitely ** not happen '' . 
  and btw  pride myself on not reading youtube comments that 's an extremely odd thing to pride yourself on . 
  i hope you know most of the people on their are twelve and posting from their arses . 
   and that comment about the eu being the only progressive force in the world you 've got him there . 
  he was being an idiot with that sentence . 
  please , by no means do all or even many europhiles like myself think that sentence is true . 
  i for one , know that it 's completely false . 
  the eu is however a progressive force and has done a ** huge ** amount of good .
