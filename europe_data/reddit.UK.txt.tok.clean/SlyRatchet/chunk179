  now that i 've got all the information together ... that 's actually a shockingly good result for the pro independence movement . 
  i mean , there were only two parties which unequivocally in favour and of those two parties absolutely destroyed everybody else in the polls with ~ 40 % compared to the next highest party at ~ 18 % . 
  that 's a pretty shockingly good result for an election which was fought on more than one issue , and in a multi-party election ( as opposed to two party elections which are the case in the usa and the uk until recently ), 
  i 've changed them to `` in favour '' after some googling to confirm , but op did n't specifically say yes or no , so i left it uncertain at first . 
  sorry , i clicked `` save '' halfway through . 
  it should be finished now . 
  so , if i were to put the information from the op into a table ... | name | english name | independence | euro affiliation | votes | seats | | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | | junts pel s\u00ed | together for the yes | in favour | probably the [ european free alliance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_alliance ) ( non - inscrits ) | 39,6 % | 62/135 | | ciutadans ( cs ) | citizens | against | [ alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_group ) | 17,9 % | 25/135 | | partit dels socialistes de cataluny ( psc ) | socialist party of catalonia | against | [ party of european socialists ( pes ) / socialists & democrats ( s&d ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_european_socialists ) | 12,7 % | 16/135 | | catalunya s\u00ed que es pot | catalonia yes it is possible , or yes we can | uncertain | [ european united left/nordic green left ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_united_left%e2%80%93nordic_green_left ) | 8,9 % | 11/135 | | partit popular de catalunya ( pp ) | popular party of catalonia | against | [ european people 's party ( epp ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party ) | 8,5 % | 11/135 | | candidatura d'unitat popular ( cup ) | candidacy of the popular unity | in favour | uncertain ( no meps ) | 8,2 % | 8/135 |, 
  i do n't know - why does n't it ? 
  it surprised me . 
  it surprised me quite a lot , actually . 
  thank you for your submission !, 
  unfortunately , it has been removed .

  we apologize for the inconvenience . 
  you 're putting words in my mouth and getting off topic . 
  i never said anything about how effective or otherwise sending the failed asylum seekers is . 
  / u/tsubouchi said that `` it 's not obvious to germany [ that refugees must be chosen carefully ] '' . 
  that 's just false for all the reasons i pointed out . 
  they have a system in place to discriminate between different types of asylum seekers and their reasons for migrating . 
  if you disagree with that assertion then attack that assertion . 
  do n't make an unrelated comment that attacks things i 've not said and do n't believe . 
  me too . 
  ( i have connections with austria ) . 
  it 's just a shame that this specific story was editorialised . 
  one could always submit a different submission, 
   for some reason . 
  i literally left you a comment . 
  flaired and everything . 
  you can resubmit the article if you copy the headline verbatim . 
  if you think their title is boring then you 'll just have to find a different source with a more interesting headline, 
  hochrechnung is ` projection ' or ` estimate ' in this instance . 
  yeah i get that , but that 's not how news subreddits work . 
  i do n't care what you call them . 
  i care that you did n't copy the submission you linked to . 
  either you include all the parties which the linked submission shows or you copy their title directly . 
  either way , you ca n't cherry pick certain bits of information from within a wider article . 
  oh for god 's sake . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  when germany made the agreement to take in 800,000 ** asylum seekers ** it knew full well that about half of them would be sent back . 
  there 's other statements the german government made at the time which corroborates this . 
  they never intended to just take in anyone . 
  they always intended to take in asylum seekers and then go through the process of determining if they are refugees or if they are economic migrants ( and therefore should be sent back ) . 
  if you 're gon na criticise somebody or some country 's stance on an issue then at least have the decency to know what their position is . 
  if you just randomly parrot stereotypes then you 're just spreading misinformation which helps no one and damages any chance of coming to a reasonable , logical solution . 
  editorialising, 
  i 'll get some sources for this later because i 'm cooking at the moment but here 's some things which will effect your life * increased heat making equatorial africa and asia unliveable leading to huge amounts of climate refugees migrating to europe on a scale several orders of magnitude larger than currently . 
  [ background information on climate and environmental refugees - national geographic ] ( http://education.nationalgeographic.co.uk/encyclopedia/climate-refugee/ ) and [ this academic article estimates that 200 million people ( roughly equal to the population of france , the uk * and * germany * combined * ) will be displaced by climate change - and that 's actually largely based on sea level displacement rather than heat and drought displacement ] ( http://www.climate.org/pdf/environmental%20exodus.pdf ) * famine in europe due to our inability to import food from other parts of the world ( also , acidification of the ocean could destroy our ability to source sea food at all further worsening the famine ) . 
  * sea level rises will likely sink large parts european coastal cities within our life time ( and beyond our life time we could even see non-coastal cities like berlin being sunk ) . 
  * additionally this will create a scramble for resources which could potentially lead to resource wars between major world powers . 
  this would significantly increase the risks of nuclear war within our lifetime , especially given that far more countries have nuclear weapons today than at the most dangerous point during the cold war ( the cuban missile crisis of 1962-3 ) . 
  and this is all just stuff which could effect you in fortress europe . 
  i 'm not even considering altruism at this point , such as the hundreds of millions of people who 'll die who are n't you in places that are n't europe . 
  even that 's understating the situation a lot . 
  europe drives a lot of global emissions rises outside of europe itself because of the large amount of carbon heavy products we import , but even with that to one side europe is still one of the heaviest polluting continents . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2012/jun/21/world-carbon-emissions-league-table-country ) europe produced 7.2 tonnes of emissions per person in 2010 . 
  the world average is 4.6 tonnes of emissions per person in 2010 . 
  so europe produces almost twice the world average of emissions per person . 
  as for europe pushing up emissions else where : the eu is largest importer of chinese goods [ ^ 1 ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/september/tradoc_122530.pdf ) and china 's huge economic industrialisation ( which has necessitated the huge consumption of fossil fuels ) is based on such exports . 
  so the eu is extremely responsible for all of the emissions released by china over the period of its industrialising because we 're pushing the demand for it with our consumption . 
  this is annoying the hell out of me . 
  i just got an up to date mac computer and i 'm trying to click on the link to watch the video and it 's telling me i do n't have quick time player . 
  it did this before on other devices . 
  i hate the eurparl website . 
  i 'm actively trying to watch europarl debates and it does n't let me . 
  i knew that it was happening , i just did n't know that it was * today * . 
  i do n't think anybody is trying to stop climate change . 
  that 's a lost cause . 
  climate change has and always will happen . 
  to say that ecologists are advocating that is misunderstanding what they 're about . 
  what they advocate is avoiding overwhelming , planet crushing levels of climate change which will cause mass extinction , sea level rises , famines and untold levels of climate refugees . 
  the green movement is a political movement , but it is a movement based on science ( even if a few of its policies are less than scientific ) . 
  97 % of climate scientists have agreed that man made climate change exists and that its effects will be catastrophic , not just objectively , but in comparison to other naturally occurring climate change evens . 
  it 's not something we can allow to happen . 
   dealing with climate change imo is n't to try to immediately reverse society , it 's to make sure that you 're always laying the groundwork for incremental progress which will emerge from the economy 10-20 years later actually , that 's not really an option at this point . 
  20 years ago , and especially at the beginning of the 1980s , incremental change was definitely on the table and it could have worked . 
  but we 've done so little for so long that now we need to start having emissions reductions of 8 % to 10 % per year in the developed world in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change . 
  the scientific models which allowed for slow , incremental change were all done in the period before we started liberalising our economies in the 80s which led to massive levels of consumption on levels not seen before and massive industrialisations throughout the world ( especially in china and india ) built on the demands of western consumption . 
  this has so exponentially increased the amount of c02 emissions over the past several decades that we no longer have the option of incremental change and must instead be quite radical otherwise we will certainly warm our atmosphere up beyond 2 degree celsius which will cause a thaw in the polar ice-caps which releases further c02 emissions which will `` lock in '' huge levels of climate change , causing further sea level rises and untold levels of climate migration , extinction and famine . 
  edit : just thought i 'd add [ an emissions chart which shows the change between 1992 and 2010 ( which uses the us energy administration as its source ) ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2012/jun/21/world-carbon-emissions-league-table-country ) . 
  as you can see , global emissions have ** increased ** by 48 % over this 18 year period , when they * need * to be going * down * . 
  emissions in most european countries have gone dropped mildly or stayed the same ( although that drop is largely because of the 2008 recession ) , but european countries are still largely responsible for the global increase of emissions through their consumption ( along with the rest of the developed world ) . 
  european countries have largely outsourced their domestic production to places like china and india , but our consumption habits have only increased . 
  [ between 2001 and 2008 household consumption rose by 2 % very year ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:eu-27_consumption_expenditure_trends_ ( 2001-2011 , _ year-on-year_change_in _ % 25 ) . png ) . 
  this level of consumption is not sustainable . 
  we can not maintain the lifestyles we have and expect to avoid massive sea level rises , extinctions famines and all the rest of it . 
  we have to curb our consumption . 
  i prefer envelopes, 
  oh my word that 's * bad * . 
  also , i had no idea catalan elections were today , 
  that must be awkward . 
  interpreters are normally so detached from the people they 're interpreting for , it must be very shocking and courageous to come out of their bubble and say ... how would you even say that `` laugh please !, 
  how 's it going learning russian ? 
  how much time can you put into it regularly to get what reward ? 
  i 'm a university student studying german and politics and doing french classes on the side but i really wanted to do russian and am not sure if it 's feasible to ever really pick it up when i 've got so much else going on, 
  do european parliament translators and interpreters ever have to deal with latin american spanish or swiss german ? 
  i know this is n't especially your area , but what further democratic legitimacy would you add ? 
  i 've always argues that the eu is far more democratic than its member states ( seeing as it uses proportional representation , has a bi-bicameral legislature and the executive/euro commission is subservient to the democratically elected bodies ), 
  if what i 've heard and seen about both parliaments horrifically poor lay out , all the bars are secret bars , because all of them are impossible to find because of said poor lay out,
