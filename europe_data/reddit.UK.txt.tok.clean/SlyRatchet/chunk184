  if it was representative then it would include nationalities like british , american , chinese , etc , which are interestingly absent ... 
  there really should be a bar for `` all immigrants '' additionally `` on welfare '' is such a bs way of phrasing it . 
  half of the people in the uk are on welfare in some form . 
  if you have a child , then you get child benefit to help with the costs . 
  if you work , but are on a low income , then ( until recently ) you got supplementary benefits . 
  if you are disabled then you get life long benefits . 
  and obviously if you are unemployed then you are `` on benefits '' . 
  all in all this means that about 50 % of the uk population is `` on benefits '' in some form . 
  what 's much more interesting is * how much * and also * why * . 
  if you are disabled or a ** legitimate ** refugee , then being on benefits is fair enough . 
  being on unemployment benefit when you are fit to work is slightly different . 
  not with that attitude it 's not . 
  i think that differences between uk and reuropean foreign policy is n't very different , but more importantly i think that their foreign policies can be made to converge by discussing it . 
  if we discuss it , i think we 'll all come to the correct realisation that they 're compatible, 
  surely all of these are just examples where european solidarity has failed and therefore cause to further support a pro-european approach rather than a eurosceptic one ? 
  you can be pro-europe and pro-eu integration * and * be critical of the specifics of the eu . 
  i 'm one of the biggest eu-philes you 'll find but even i will tell you that i am pro-europe and pro-reform . 
  the solutions to almost all of our problems are further cross border integration , not less . 
  we are completely unable to combat climate change without acting together and centralising climate policy in one institution . 
  managing the eu common market , which is the largest economy in the world , bigger than the usa and china , would be impossible without centralising its decision making bodies to a single institution . 
  we need a common eu energy policy , a common defence policy , a common foreign policy and a common economic policy because non of these policy areas can adequately be carried out by the 28 member states individually . 
  if we act alone non of us will be able to make any sort of adequate progress in these areas . 
  we should all stick together , otherwise , we will all hang separately . 
  you know the constant meta complaints about the state of the subreddit are becoming almost as pervasive and annoying as the flooding of immigration topics which the meta complaints are angry about . 
  perhaps the first step to achieving more balance is to appreciate other kinds of content when it does occur rather than using it as an opportunity to complain about said content not being more common ? 
  i 'm very excited for the ama . 
  i have a few questions about the secretariat in luxembourg and what the hell it 's role actually is plus a few others . 
   like the girl who thought the guy with his bandana , work clothes and tool was a dangerous terrorist with a weapon ) wait , what now ? 
  source, 
  i recently started listening to some new french music . 
  my favourite french song so far is [ sur ma route ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-z_bzs8t3m ) ( on my way ) by black m. i do n't know why i find it so catchy . 
  for some reason they were playing this in a kebab shop in brussels and i asked for the song because i liked it . 
  another discover was that people in brussels just do n't ... do customer service like i 'm used to . 
  i would walk up to the counter in caf\u00e9s and just stand there for a good five minutes waiting for the waiter/waitress to come ask me what i want . 
  i would also be eating my food/drinking my coffee whatever and the only present staff member would just leave the shop completely so i was alone . 
  that 's not bad service so much , but it was bloody weird . 
  i 'm not used to be trusted with such responsibility . 
  also , why do i always pay at the end of our transaction ? 
  why ca n't i pay for coffee at the counter when i order , rather than having to wait an eternity for you to give me the bill ? 
  all in all , it feels like the brussels people are very trusting of their customers . 
  i could have very easily left without paying every single time or taken extra food from the shop or something when the shop was left absent , but they trust you not to . 
  which is just strange to me somehow . 
  do you expect us to change every time we get a meta thread ? 
  much more , do you expect us to change ** immediately ** once there is a megathread ? 
  if something serious comes up in a megathread where there 's unanimous support for change , it will take us ** at least ** a week to actually implement a solution . 
  just because change does n't happen at the click of the fingers does n't mean change is n't happening . 
  we 've changed policy many times due not meta discussions ( on davidreiss666 , the megathreads , elements of our rule book ) and yet we still get accused of being autocrats who want to entirely ignore the community . 
  just because we do n't flip flop from one megathread to the next without any clear plan does n't mean we are n't listening and altering our policies according to the community 's wishes . 
  it 's just that we are trying to make changes that will actually work long term which takes time . 
  so thanks for this baseless accusations . 
  so you 're solution to the endless meta posts is just to implement all of your personal suggestions ? 
  with all due respect that 's not gon na work . 
  there will always be better discussions . 
  that 's like suggestions that one day we 'll have an end to politics and the need to discuss it . 
  there will * always * be a need and a desire to discuss moderation and other meta aspects of the sub . 
  this discussion will never end . 
  it 's a process , not an event . 
  as such , it requires a place to be discussed specifically without blocking out everything else . 
  this is that solution . 
  the process of discussion can continue in this way , and so can the ordinary use of the main subreddit, 
  it 's not on our agenda at the moment . 
  we 're having a daily battle to keep the modqueue down ( a battle we frequently lose ) . 
  when we 've got more mods - we 'll likely put it on the agenda to flair all posts ( or flair all posts if there is a use for flair ) .

  it 's like bemoaning that slave-traders will lose their jobs if we ban slavery . 
  on balance , the slave-trader 's job is n't * that * important . 
  he could always find another one . 
  he could trade something else . 
  maybe the animal trainers for the circuses could work in zoos or animal sanctuaries or something instead . 
  they 've got good skills . 
  time and manpower . 
  we do n't have enough time or manpower to manage the subreddit as it is , let alone develop new features . 
  we 're constantly re-thinking policy . 
  no particular moderation stance we have is ever fixed or permanent . 
  all are dependent on results . 
  if you have any suggestions for how to actually improve the place ( especially if there is any evidence to support it ) then we 're always open to suggestions . 
  edit :  i imagine you thought twice about giving a straight answer to it eh , not so much . 
  i know i have a tendency to give * hugely * over long answers ( especially to moderation questions ) , but it 's because a usually feel the situation is just far too complex to give an answer any shorter . 
  with this question , not so much . 
  i am just gon na say that , just because i 'm unhappy , does n't mean i 'm gon na do anything about it . 
  one of the responsibilities of being in a management position is that you must resist the urge to take any action just because it 's action . 
  if the mod team is gon na do something , we want clear reasoning that it will solve a problem or add other benefits . 
  at the moment , i do n't see much we can do apart from adding flair-based filters and enlarging the mod team . 
   question : is the mod team happy with how the entire frontpage is flooded with topics that deal with the same very subject ? 
  in a word : no .
