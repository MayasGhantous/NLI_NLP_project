  there may be people in there who just went , `` well , i really do n't agree with putting people to death , but if i say i do n't agree with it , i 'm not agreeing with allah . '', 
   i 'm putting this out there because i was a part of a very conservative christian group who would do this shit . 
  they would pull these tactics where it made you feel like you were agreeing to basic stuff , and it put you on the spot in front of a lot of people if you disagreed . 
  i guarantee you not everyone in that room is sincere or believes what the guy is saying , merely they 're going with the crowd . 
   we 're doing the same thing now by looking at the muslims in the video as a group and not seeing them as individuals because they are voting as one , and not as they probably would if they were alone , writing about their opinions on how far interpretations of the koran go . 
  source : https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2r7i0z/norway_all_muslims_agree_stoning_is_ok_moderate/cndc434 by / u/ceedubs2 i also did a little bit of digging and found that the conference is called [ `` peace conference scandinavia 2013 '' ] ( http://www.islamnet.no/aktiviteter/in-events/2297-pcs ) . 
  i ca n't help but be reminded of the all the former and current authoritarian , communist countries of eastern europe and asia , like the german ** democratic ** republic and ** democratic people 's republic ** of korea , the ** people 's republic ** of china and the ** people 's republic ** of poland . 
  the point is that all of these countries were not democracies and were not run for or by their people . 
  these countries new that they were n't any of these things , which is precisely why they put the words in their name . 
  i ca n't help but think that this so-called peace conference is doing something similar . 
   but what i imagine an average muslim is . 
  let 's not get carried away from the point of the film here . 
  the presenter says very clearly at 07:55  wie viele familien so denken wei\u00dft niemand -  how many families think this way ? 
  nobody knows it could be many , it could be few ; it could be most of them , it could be a minority ; or it could be anywhere in between . 
  we do n't know . 
  what we do know is that there is a parallel culture in germany at the very least which does not respect german values and uses an alternative justice system , which is awful . 
  it is absolutely unacceptable that there are parallel justice systems going on and that members of specific communities are radically discriminated against . 
  we need to stop it and we need to fight it . 
  but we must also ensure that our response is proportional . 
  if this becomes a a germans verses muslims thing , or european verses muslims or refugees , then it wo n't solve anything . 
  i think it 's clear that there are muslims communities that do n't want to integrate and do n't accept european values or law , but i also think that it 's clear that there are muslims who do respect european culture and our laws . 
  i think it would be incredibly sad , sadder than what 's currently going on , if we forced out these humans who want are and have integrated but are still muslim along with those who do n't . 
  that 's what i mean when i say we should be proportional . 
  and it also means sticking to what we know , which is that we have no idea how large the parallel society with its parallel justice system goes . 
  the response should bear that in mind . 
  we certainly cut down on our use of permanent bans and shadow bans , but we do still use them . 
  our default ban is either one month or one week depending on the moderator , and then if a the user appeals we generally unban them . 
  if they infringe our rules again , it 's a permanent ban . 
  if we suspect that a user is using an alternative account to circumvent a previous ban , then we 'll go straight to shadow bans . 
  things are still somewhat up in the air though . 
  we 're currently working on some internal documents to more clearly outline our responsibilities and operating practices , and we 're adding new mods * and * we 're re-writing the rule book a bit , to take out some of the more egregious rules . 
  you 're aware that 's arthur scargill , the guy who led the trade unions against thatcher in the 80s , not jeremy corbyn , right ? 
  i 'm not exactly sure what the point is . 
  it 'd also be nice if you pointed more to the relevant sections of the speech , rather than just linking me to something which is 45 minutes long . 
  what am i meant to be confirming ? 
  huh , no . 
  if the uk imports energy then it imports it from france 's nuclear power stations . 
  additionally , for the coal plants that already exists in the uk ( which should be decommissioned asap ) it 's much better to import coal from abroad in the short term rather than investing huge sums of money into reopening the uk coal mines , which is money that could be spent on research into nuclear fusion or investment in renewables . 
  if you 're a real environmentalist then you should shut down the coal power plants as fast as possible . 
  but corbyn does not want to do that . 
  he 's not even saying that we should leave things at current levels . 
  he actually wants to expand the coal industry which is utterly ridiculous . 
  this is the policy where you can see the difference between hard left labour and soft right greens . 
  i really do n't think that 's a credible explanation . 
  i do n't see any reason why this effect would happen . 
  to me it just seems like an excuse to avoiding acknowledging any of the benefits of this megathreads ( and there were benefits , as well as negatives ) . 
  my interpretation is that the reason for the increased activity from far right users was because of the mass unban we did at the end of the megathread period . 
  we knew that we would be allowing many genuinely bad users back into the community , but due to poor record keeping and man power it 's the only fair option we had available . 
  this means that suddenly we had absolutely loads of far right users which we 've rebanning ever since . 
  they are responsible for the inert in activity by far right users in my.opinion . 
  there were some larger effects on the sub at large because of removing the megathreads , but they have nothing to do with build up of pressure . 
  it 's like any major news event ; if you deliberately minimise the space for discussing it , then less people will discuss it , which represents itself as less overall activity . 
  there was no pressure . 
  it 's just that the megathreads deliberately minimises user activities around immigration topics and now that those threads are gone there are a lot of immigration topics which garner a lot of activity . 
  non of this has anything to do with a build up of pressure . 
  i do n't know where this weird idea of pressure comes from but it seems to be totally unfounded, 
  the left does n't . 
  parts of the left do : particularly the old democratic socialist labour left . 
  the labour left is mostly focused on raising living standards through work and their narrative is still hugely influenced by marx , so it 's just a bit old fashioned . 
  the industrial working class is very important to them , but they 've not adapted their perspectives to realise that the working class does n't exist like that anymore , so their response is to try and recreate it by reopening the coal mines . 
  there 's a whole variety of left movements in the uk which do n't care about coal mines ( such as the social democratic wing of the lib dems , the labour party modernisers , the entire green party , et al ) . 
  these movements have entirely different ideologies and perspectives which are based on principles such as freedom , protecting the environment or raising living standards by compromising with capitalism . 
  these are all very distinct from the parts of the left which fetishism the old industrial coal mining communities . 
  please do n't treat it as one huge movement . 
  it 's multifaceted . 
  many left movements have almost nothing in common with each other , apart from that people outside like to group them together for no particular reason, 
  oh you mean the other eu countries rather than the eu institutions themselves, 
  i do n't think the eu is against it . 
  they 're not allowed to say what their opinion is ( a member state has to ask them , and no member state is willing to do that ) and any decisions they take our because of the treaties , and the eu does n't make its own treaties , the member states ( again ) do . 
  my perception from listening to ex-commission president borrosso ( who is able to say whatever he likes because he 's no longer an eu official ) was that the eu institutions would be vaguely accommodating towards secessionist countries .

  i certainly think it 's an interesting and novel idea . 
  i had n't really considered it before . 
  however , my initial response is that it would detract more than it helps . 
  this is because , people who are xenophobic towards greeks/russians/germans / brits/french/americans wo n't stop being xenophobic just because they 're not sure about the nationality of the person they 're being xenophobic towards .
