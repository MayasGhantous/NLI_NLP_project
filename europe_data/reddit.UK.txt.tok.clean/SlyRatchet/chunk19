  insight 's always nice , 
  even without digging into the the link myself , it looks like you quote the article saying essentially what i was saying about the proportion of people from different ethnic groups  in february 2012 a report was published by the ministry of justice providing demographic statistics of the people charged over participation the riots up to 1 february 2012 which revealed that 41 % of those brought before the courts identified themselves as being from the white group , 39 % from the black ethnic group , 12 % from the mixed ethnic group , 6 % the asian ethnic group , and 2 % the other ethnic group . 
  it looks like i went a little too far saying that a majority of rioters were white british , but white british is quite clearly the largest ethnic group and comes very close to being a majority . 
  so essentially we 're agreeing on both counts ? 
  the england riots were mainly perpetrated by ( to use the anti-multiculturalists ' own phrase ) `` native white population '' and that rioting has no inherent connection with ethnicity or culture . 
  would you like to link me to that part of the thread ? 
  you have to take things into account , such as the population * outside of london * as many external analyses of the riots are far too london centric and the per cent of the population which is naturally of a particular ethnic group . 
  what i am saying is that immigrants are n't the only group of people who cause trouble , which seems to be the sort of idea being ground out . 
  people of all ethnicities are potential rioters , not just those from minority backgrounds , because rioting is a thing that people do and not a thing that minorities do . 
  it 's a human thing not a muslim/black/roma thing, 
  / u/crocpb probably just sat their law exam 3/4 months ago . 
  uh , no . 
  there were a lot of third generation immigrants in the england riots , but it was a majority perpetrated by white british people who can trace their lineage in the uk back hundreds of years . 
  the england riots had very little to do with race or immigration . 
  people who are by all definitions english perpetrated a set of riots much worse than a lot of the riots like the one we can see in the op which everybody 's looking at and saying `` ahh , multiculturalism 's fault '' . 
  the england riots prove that it 's not just about ethnic minorities or immigration . 
  immigrants do n't riot . 
  people do . 
  good response, 
  it is n't . 
  we 're just a favourite target for sites like stormfront which enjoy raiding us and trying to be `` enlightening '' . 
  that 's why you see so many gilded comments . 
  someone from stormfront 's come along to try and encourage it . 
  90 % of the threads and submissions on / r/europe are fine , but every one in one hundred gets raided and is best avoided . 
  dude , do n't forget to add the nsra tag . 
  i look a good view of the rear too , especially when boris is involved . 
  if nobody else is going to say it i will ; that thing looks fucking terrifying . 
  it 's the kind of thing which appears in films halfway through whilst an unimportant and usually quite sympathetic character is alone , usually in an ally and then the machine just turns it lights on , revs the engine and mows them down before cutting to a shot of the detectives the next day hovering over the dead character 's body . 
  do n't forget to use the report button guys . 
  we usually get most of the racist bile that passes through here , but if people report the racist detritus we 'll be able to get to it several orders of magnitude quicker , which 'll maybe alleviate some fears about the oncoming apocalypse . 
  i like to think that we 're reaching a point in europe , where nations are so pluralist that we do n't need specific countries for specific nations of people . 
  even if we 're not as close as i hope , i think it is a more achievable goal that we all learn to except multi-culturalism before we resort to taking a large section of land and turning it into a new country . 
  learning to get a long with people is just a simple and better solution . 
  does n't sound that ground breaking , really . 
  from the sounds of the only quote in the article ( and there is , really , only one quote ) the referendum is more going to be about ratifying the new agreement they come to , or making further decisions about the future of switzerland . 
  it does n't appear from the this quote , that it will necessarily be asking them the exact same question  `` it will be necessary for the people of switzerland to vote again on what they want the future of the bilateral agreements to be ... by the end of 2016 or the beginning of 2017 , '' - monsieur president, 
  it 's a nice animation , and it does show how migration really started picking up exponentially as time passed ( although it would have been nice if it had been normalised for population expansion ) , but i wish it was demonstrated in a way which allow one to see where the more * unusual * migrations occurred . 
  for instance , we know that large numbers of angles , saxons and jutes migrated from their respective lands which had a huge impact on english genetic history , but that 's not really visible here and there are almost certainly similar occurrences which took place that i am not aware that the data this map is representing could show , but does n't due to how it is represented . 
  so , nice content , but could be so much more . 
   i 'm not insulting europe in anyway well , you are * kind of * being maybe just a little bit insulting . 
  you might not * mean * to be insulting , but actions matter more than intentions . 
  because they like europe and european things ? 
  you can be a europhile without being european . 
  for instance i would describe myself as a germanophile and a francophile despite having no history in france and only a partial family history in germany . 
  i subscribe and occasionally comment in subs like / r/de and / r/france because i 'm a sort of cultural voyeurist . 
  i love the way they 've both replied to defend their intellectual and sexual ( respectively ) integrity, 
   freebooted excuse me a moment whilst i tweet this to brady and grey, 
  oops . 
  meant to say 80,000 and not 80,000,000 . 
  / r/uk has eighty * thousand * subscribers not eighty * million * . 
  i think the seed was originally developed in america and the genetic code was patented , but now it 's technically a chinese export . 
  tbf , a lot of the uk `` right wing '' parties are n't right wing , they 're just authoritarian , and we tend to thing authoritarian is right wing . 
  for instance , the british national party is actually more left wing economically than the the liberal democrats , labour or conservatives ( but not the greens or snp iirc ) . 
  however , the bnp is basically against civil liberties and things that the whole idea of ` equality ' is a ` myth ' which leads us to branding them right-wing extremists because they sound more than a bit hitlery . 
  they 're certainly extremists , but they 're not right wing extremists * in the economic * sense that we typically think of . 
  they are arguably right wing in a social and civil liberties sense , though . 
  with farage and le pen it 's a bit more complicated , because , for instance , farage is ( ostensibly ) a libertarian . 
  there was an interesting factoid i heard for the 1992 uk general election , which was that ~ 30 % of the electorate who voted , decided who they were voting for in * in the last 7 days * before the election was due , and an additional 5 % made up their mind * on the day * . 
  people do n't really know what they 're going to do come election time , is what i take away from that . 
  well , it 's a little bit more than a protest vote at this stage , but people will still likely return to their usual parties * en masse * when it 's time for a * real * election i.e. 
  the presidential elections or the one for the national assembly . 
  [ this was my favourite one ] ( http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/10522301_682754691813300_1256809135_n.jpg ), 
  keep in mind that 19kg is n't a lot over an entire year , assuming poland 's already a nation that somewhat enjoys eating apples . 
  an `` unmentioned '' burden ? 
  you guys sure do n't seem to mind mentioning it, 
  we 've called up / r/europeanfederalists , / r/deutschland and [ the international administrator fund ] ( http://reddit.com/r/blog ) to help with bail us out . 
  it 's not just / r/europe they 're excluding . 
  uk ips are not participating in the geodefault programme generally . 
  if you keep in mind that the geodefaults are there to help smaller reddit communities , primarily those of the non english speaking world , to grow , then it makes a lot of sense seeing as the uk is predominantly english speaking and already has a lot of very well established subreddits , such as / r/unitedkingdom which is almost in the top 300 for subscriber rankings and about 80,000 subscribers . 
  keep in mind that / r/europe is the largest subreddit ( iirc ) to be participating in the geodefault programme and we only have 60,000 and are ranked roughly 440th in subscriber rankings . 
  the main subs which the geodefault programme is for , seems to be places like / r/brasil , which is the portuguese speaking subreddit for actual brazilians ( as opposed to / r/brazil , which is english speaking ) and / r/brasil has only 5,000 subscribers , most of which has come by virtue of being a geodefault ( they had 3,000 before being a geodefault ) . 
  if one goes google around for subreddits like / r/de / r/austria / r/thenetherlands and / r/france one starts getting an idea of the size of communities that reddit is trying to reach with this programme , and that the uk reddit community is far larger and better established than that . 
  * but still * i think we ( united kingdom-ers ) should be included in the programme . 
  we have a well established community ect , but we would benefit generally from having our own defaults ( in addition to the reddit wide ones ) . 
  but the rational of the reddit admins is still understandable , even if i do n't 100 % agree with it . 
  edit : too many zeros . 
  today i learned that we are the four-hundredth-and-forty-third most subscribed subreddit on the whole site , just above / r/colorizedhistory and just bellow / r/tinytits http://redditmetrics.com/top/offset/400, 
  or turks or serbs , from the sounds of it , though that could be technical . 
  it sounds like excluding the uk was intentional , though and wo n't change in the near future :( i 'll be asking the admin running it to enable geodefaults whenever appropriate , though . 
  uk redditors would be greatly appreciative of them , i think . 
  hi , just a friendly reminder that users are n't their flags . 
  just because someone associates with serbia does n't mean they do n't have a right to proclaim things ` travesties ' or other such terms . 
  thanks . 
  i simply must ask this . 
  you believe that nations have rights to particular pieces of land , and that the people of those nations inherit the burdens ( be them moral or otherwise ) of their forparents , right ? 
  how do you think becoming a member of a particular nation takes place ? 
  is it dependent on whether or not you 're a `` cultural '' member of the society ( speak the language , partake in customs , ect ) , or residence , or birth place or is it purely passed down through family lineage ? 
  for instance , if you are a member of the german people ( s ) , do you have to have descended from a particular ancient german volk/folk in order to become a member of the german nation ? 
  you know those unelected old bags are actually the best upholders of civil liberties in the whole british government ? 
  the elected government usually ignores human rigths et al as much as it can get away with , ever since blair and his ` war on terror ' but the house of lords blocked all of the most severe restrictions and demanded that ` sunset clauses ' ( which mean the legislation will expire after a year and need to be renewed ) into a lot of the acts , such as the [ prevention of terrorism act ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevention_of_terrorism_act_2005 ) , which , by the way , had to be created in the first place because a judge * who sat in the house of lords * declared the previous legislation incompatible . 
  anyway , the lords opinion on matters pertaining to civil liberties is actually very relevant . 
  i 'm still fundamentally in favour of the right to be forgotten , in principle , although i am definitely letting the lords ' opinion influence me . 
  many others in the united kingdom do the same , because the lords hold a surprising amount of legitimacy . 
  what about there being a house of lords ? 
  log out and to go to www.reddit.com/r/europe and see if the `` subscribe '' button is already punched in . 
  then log back in and tell me the result :p, 
  i really do n't see why mali is any of our concern . 
  with the balkans you can argue that it 's our neighbour and what happens their effects us , but even if mali does provide one european country with some nuclear material , it 's not like all of north africa is `` our backyard '' . 
  anyway , i think the fundamental undeprinning of my whole point of view is that we should n't get involved in things that do n't concern us . 
  it 's not our job to intervene in conflicts halfway around the globe , and if we did do that , we 'd probably just mess things up anyway .
