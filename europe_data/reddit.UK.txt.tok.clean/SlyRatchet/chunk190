  the bbc journalist said ( keep in mind he 's speaking , not writing ) that the police were there when she fell over , which is incredibly relevant for what he goes onto talk about in the rest of the report . 
  if he 'd have said that the woman just fell on the floor , but excluded the fact that there were police there , then it would n't have made any sense to the viewer as to why the migrants and asylum seekers got riled up . 
  sure , it sounds slightly bias if you examine these three words out of a whole news report and look at them in isolation , but you can make anything look bias if you choose to pick out three random words and not pay any attention to the context . 
  the police were there . 
  from a journalist 's perspective that 's incredibly relevant for the rest of the story . 
  this woman is a tiny detail which ignited a fire . 
  if the police had n't been there then the migrants and asylum seekers would n't have got riled up . 
  if you take one small section of a report and pick up on three words which were in ( ` with the police ' ) then you can make anything look bias . 
  i agree that the man who appears to be her husband threw the woman onto the tracks , or at least did most of the work pushing her onto the tracks . 
  however the bbc report does n't deny this . 
  it does n't prescribe any blame for how she got on the tracks . 
   the bbc more than suggested that it was the police doing it . 
  so you 're accusing the bbc of lying for something that it did n't say ? 
  do you agree that the bbc did not say that the police pushed the woman onto the tracks ? 
  so you 're accusing the bbc of lying , because of something that it did n't say ? 
  you 're aware that from my perspective you 're equally talking about things which are n't there . 
  you can see the hand coming from off screen as she 's getting pulled down . 
  there 's also parts of the video where the woman is partially obscured . 
  the only differences between me and you is that you 're being incredulous and using lots of exclamation marks . 
  uhem . 
  allow me to repeat something . 
    ## ** the report does n't deny that ** ## -  `` there was a push and a shove and she ended up on the railway line . '', 
  -  he did n't say the police did it . 
  it does n't . 
  the bbc journalist does n't say that the police pushes them onto the tracks . 
  people are just pretending that they did . 
  it 's like that pakistani rapist article from yesterday where all of the comments were filled with people saying `` omg how stupid refugee '' despite there being no evidence whatsoever that he was a refugee . 
  if you would like to read the other comments i 've made ( and i 've had at least three times so far )  the report does n't deny that . 
  `` there was a push and a shove and she ended up on the railway line . '', 
  he did n't say the police did it . 
  also , the footage is more vague than it appears . 
  you can see a hand pulling her to the ground as well from off screen . 
  that 's not how this works . 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
  the bbc is a corporation ( a state owned corporation ) . 
  like all corporations , it has a board of directors and a constitution ( in the form of a charter ) . 
  the charter prescribes how the corporation will operate , and according to which values . 
  all corporations have these . 
  the bbc is n't somehow suspect for having one , and insinuating that the bbc having a charter is suspicious just shows how little you understand what you 're talking about . 
   considering the bbc is known for having a bias towards conservative view points it would surprise me . 
  no it does n't . 
  the bbc does n't have a bias in either direction . 
  people from the far left and far right just accuse it of having biases in the opposite direction to themselves because it benefits them to slander an impartial source of news . 
  if people do n't trust the news then extremists can spread their lies and have them believed . 
  how can the bbc have a radical conservative bias and a radical left wing bias , and a radical liberal bias * all at the same time * . 
  do you have anything constructive to say other than saying that you disagree with me whilst providing no information whatsoever why ? 
  i 've explained my point of view and how it does n't fit with yours . 
  maybe we could have a constructive conversation and try and explain where our perspectives differs ? 
  it 's unclear what happened even if you are at the front and you have a video camera . 
  the footage is far from clear imho . 
  i also do n't know why we 're making such a big deal about this . 
  it 's like the most tiny , and arbitrary detail . 
  a woman fell on some railway tracks . 
  accounts differ on how she got there . 
  non of that matters . 
  what matters is the giant train of migrants and asylum seekers . 
  the report does n't deny that . 
  `` there was a push and a shove and she ended up on the railway line . '', 
  he did n't say the police did it . 
  also , the footage is more vague than it appears . 
  you can see a hand pulling her to the ground as well from off screen . 
  the report does n't deny that . 
  `` there was a push and a shove and she ended up on the railway line . '', 
  he did n't say the police did it . 
  also , the footage is more vague than it appears . 
  you can see a hand pulling her to the ground as well from off screen . 
  yeah . 
  the report does n't deny that . 
  `` there was a push and a shove and she ended up on the railway line . '', 
  he did n't say the police did it . 
  also , the footage is more vague than it appears . 
  you can see a hand pulling her to the ground as well from off screen . 
  i 've watched the content . 
  i do n't see the lie . 
  it says `` somehow there was a push and a shove with the police and she ended up on the railway lines '' which is basically what happens . 
  they were with the police . 
  there was pushing and shoving ( you can see a hand come out from off screen to pull her to the floor ) and then she ends up on the railway tracks , refusing to get up . 
  no it is n't . 
  bbc has a charter which prescribes that it is impartial . 
  russia today does n't and deliberately smudges the facts . 
  i do n't actually see what the bbc is lying about in the clip . 
  i 've watched it and it seems to broadly explain what happened . 
  do you have any actual evidence of that apart from a couple of isolated examples . 
  if you can give me more than 10 examples i will be impressed . 
  i do n't actually see what the lie is . 
  it says `` somehow there was a push and a shove with the police and she ended up on the railway lines '' which is basically what happens . 
  they were with the police . 
  there was pushing and shoving ( you can see a hand come out from off screen to pull her to the floor ) and then she ends up on the railway tracks , refusing to get up .
