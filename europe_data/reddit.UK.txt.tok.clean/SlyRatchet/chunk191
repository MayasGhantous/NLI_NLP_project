  it 's what happened , is it not ? 
  if i 'm missing something i 'd love to know . 
  i do n't see what your problem is . 
  first you 're annoyed that they 've misrepresented the news . 
  now you 're annoyed that they 've fixed their mistake ? 
  they do n't have one . 
  they 're incredibly impartial . 
  i 'd even go so far as to say they are the most impartial news organisation on the planet , and definitely the most impartial major news organisation . 
  they have strict guidelines for how they report the news which have been perfected over decades of scrutiny by parliamentary committees . 
  if they make any criticism/praise of anything political they need to balance it out with criticism/praise of all other things . 
  that 's laid out in the bbc charter . 
  but people of the far left and right like to criticise it for being biased , because both of them benefit by slandering fairly objective news organisations . 
  if there 's no news source people can trust , then extremists can spin their propaganda and be taken more seriously . 
  i do n't think one mistake discredits an institution which has almost 100 years of quality reporting under its belt . 
  being fantastic does n't mean being perfect . 
  the bbc is fantastic and its by far the best there is . 
  tthere 've been mistakes in the past and there will be mistakes in the future , but it will continue being fantastic because the mistakes are so few and far between . 
  just look at it this way : if any other news organisation told a mistruth , we 'd hardly notice . 
  but the bbc 's is held in such high regard that it 's actually news when they get the news partially wrong . 
  has saudi arabia actually made any criticisms of europe over the refugee crisis ? 
  i 've not heard of it if they have, 
  all nations are bound by international law . 
  infringing their sovereignty is permissible if a nation acts against international law ( i.e. 
  by infringing on their citizens human rights which will cause a refugee crisis ) it 's not a colony . 
  a colony is a territory of an other nation . 
  all these nations are fine to do whatever they want so long as they adhere to international law and respect human rights . 
  you can say you do n't like the idea , but do so using actual information rather than hyperbole . 
  iraq is entirely different because we did that for defensive purposes . 
  it 's the same in afghanistan . 
  i 'm arguing that we should provide military support after the war is over to ensure stability , which is the thing lacking in all the other foreign policy disasters, 
  no , we should topple ruthless dictators and support the rest . 
  the only time european militaries should get involved is when the leader of a country has started to seriously terrorise his own people , which is , you know , against international law anyway . 
  yeah , that made the front page and led to the resignation of the head of the police force for all of south yorkshire . 
  iirc there 's a huge inquiry going on which is interviewing police officers and is probably gon na lead to some pretty big prosecutions . 
  those are ' t the only two options and it 's disingenuous to make it look like that 's the case . 
  here 's something i wrote four months ago . 
  -- the australian measures should only be implemented as an absolute last resort , and even then i 'm skeptical of if they should be used . 
  instead of sending people back to die in africa and the middle east ( after they risked death at sea ) , we should ** firstly ** focus on supporting those countries which are the source of these refugees through ** financial , logistic and , when necessary , military ** help in order to create stable and inclusive governments which hold a monopoly on the use of force and use said force responsibly . 
  this is something we 've started to do by having some of the highest overseas aid budgets in the world as a percent of gdp , but that money needs to be a ) better target , so as to not be eaten up by corruption in those governments , and b ) raised further because whilst eu members still have the highest aid budgets in the world , that amounts to only 0.7 % of gdp or less . 
  *** secondly *** , ** we should target the human traffickers and people smugglers , rather than the refugees ** . 
  human trafficking between europe and the outside world is a multi-billion euro industry . 
  it effects not only refugees in the mediterranean , but also the trafficking of sex workers from east asia to the european union ( and by this i mean sex workers who are here against their will , and can often be children ) . 
  the refugees are not to blame here . 
  they are needy and desperate . 
  these smuggling wrings are the ones putting their lives at risk and penetrating international boarders illegally , for profit . 
  they are the ones who are sending these people across the med in these extremely overburdened and often unseaworthy crafts . 
  we should also intervene occasionally in african and middle eastern affairs , but only those extreme circumstances where more the situation has already significantly deteriorated and refugees are already gushing forward . 
  this means providing support to regimes fighting extremist organisations like deash ( a.k.a. 
  isis ) , al shibab , al qaeda and the taliban who are trying to cause civil war , and also not fighting governments which produce more refugees , pain and suffering than the people they 're keeping out . 
  this means that there was a time when gaddafi in libya and assad in syria were a net benefit to syria , to us and to the world , because they provided basic standards of living and ensured that there was order and stability . 
  however , there came a point when both assad and gaddafi became worse than they people they were keeping at bay and unable to provide a monopoly on the use of force , such as when assad started using chemical attacks on his own people and when gaddafi tried to use fighter pilots to airstrike protestors in benghazi . 
  and we should support any legitimate movement within those countries which has the potential to provide stability . 
  that last point is key . 
  we should intervene to destroy those who would cause chaos and harm , and provide stability in its stead . 
  that means supporting those countries until stability can be reached . 
  we need stable countries which have a monopoly on the use of force and respect basic standards in order to stop the flow of refugees . 
  if we can destroy a country , like we 've proven we can time and time again , then we can build one too . 
  ** in the meantine ** , whilst we are furthering these measures , to stop the flow of refugees at the source , we should continue to help those who make it to our borders because they are desperate human beings . 
  the ones who are left behind in the war zones and dictatorships and so on are also needy and require our assistance , and we should grant them that and we should work towards helping them . 
  but in the meantime we ** should not ignore those who have arrived at our door step ** , having risked their lives to come here ( and many who never make it here ) . 
  we should accept them into the eu and develop a ** common european refugee settlement policy ** which distributes refugees around the eu who arrive at our borders , so that the burden does not fall on some member states disproportionately . 
  this will allow us to focus on the refugee crisis at source , rather than trying to fix individual fires that keep breaking out on the countries who 're hardest hit . 
  i love that almost all the users from a specific country 's most used word is the name of their own country, 
  i 've just realised that the eu produces virtually no games consoles . 
  this needs to be changed . 
   but in reality nobody should expect any thing to come out of reddit . 
  which is no excuse for not true . 
  reddit has far more potential for informed discussion than most irl conversations . 
   the current policy seems to be , let 's save them and pack them to germany . 
  and current policies can and do change according to the public 's wishes , which is hwy we need to make a passionate , logical and informed case for the refugee crisis and for syria , which is convincing to both the moderate left and the moderate right . 
  * slam * ## ** aaaahhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaaahhhhrr ** ## * slam *, 
  i totally agree . 
  these two factions will never agree . 
  but these are n't the only two factions . 
  they 're only a small minority of extremists at either end of the political spectrum . 
  the majority of people have a whole spectrum of reasonable views on the situation within that . 
  however , the moderates who lay within the two extremes * get called * racists or sjws by the opposing extreme , which polarises the debate and stops any chance of the majority coming to a compromise . 
  i 'm reminded of [ this video by cgpgrey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3j_rhkqjc ), 
  trust me , i get how you feel . 
  i 've got to read all the worst comments every day ( well , supposed to be everyday but : understaffing ) and see whether they 're bad enough to remove or not . 
  if you have any ideas for things the mods could do to alleviate some of the problems , we 'd love to hear it . 
  this evidence is good enough for me , and the recommendations from your former co-mods is especially useful . 
  other mods may want more information , but i leave that up to them . 
  my one other question is if you can shed any light on why you stepped down . 
  you can also using a private message , or just tell us that it 's completely private/personal . 
  a few points * there definitely is brigading * the brigading is not the cause of the potent anti-refugee and often racist sentiments found on the sub * much of the far right extremists are home grown * i expect the content to improve as we enter into september and europe 's parliaments and governments get back to work ( creating news ) from their summer recess and as we gradually rebann users who had to be unbanned previously due to faulty record keeping . 
  once we add new mods ( in two week 's time ) the situation should also significantly improve because we 're very understaffed at the moment . 
  * apart from that we do n't have a specific long term policy . 
  we 're going to wait and see . 
  if the situation clearly does not improve , we have a few proposals that we 'd like to try . 
  * we 're going to implement filters in any case and see if they have an effect , as per the wishes of many community members . 
  * the best thing you can do individually to help is switch the sorting option on / r/europe occasionally from `` top '' or `` hot '' to `` new '' which will show you all the newest submissions to / r/europe . 
  please vote on these based on whether it 's interesting content or not ( regardless of whether you agree with the content or not ) and report anything which you have any suspicions that it breaks the rules . 
  also , commenting on new submissions is extra helpful . 
  the first hour of a submissions life is pivotal . 
  the votes it gets at that point will likely determine whether it gets on the front page or not . 
  do you have any evidence that you were a moderator at the subreddits you listed ? 
  the only ones i can see in the sidebar are / r/worldpowers and a few with less subscribers . 
  also : why are you no longer a moderator at these places ? 
  i 'm here to discuss the attempted rape of a german woman near munich who bit of the rapist 's tongue .
