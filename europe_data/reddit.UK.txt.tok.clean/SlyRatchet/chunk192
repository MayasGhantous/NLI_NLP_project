  you know , exactly the thing which is in the title of the op . 
  it does n't really have anything to do with culture , let alone refugees , which is why no news sources mentions that he 's even pakistani in their headlines and there 's no evidence * at all * that * anything * about refugees is involved at all . 
  if i did n't know better i 'd say you were trying to take advantage of a rape story to push your own agenda . 
  oh those rules are outdated . 
  we 're working on a new set specifically to revise that rule . 
  it 's a remnant of when some other mods used to moderate here who are no longer with us . 
  we fully agree with the subreddit 's user base that this rule should be removed , which is why we 're not enforcing it, 
  ah , fascinating . 
  but why did you comment it here ? 
  multiple : meaning you 've seen four ? 
  four comments which broke our subreddit rules , no less . 
  they 're also extremely rare asylum seekers in germany . 
  either way , i do n't like to make generalisations like `` oh he 's pakistani , he 's probably a refugee '' or `` oh he 's indian , he 's probably a rapist '' because they 're just that : generalisations . 
  they 're not accurate . 
  they 're just guesses . 
  if you have any facts about this particular rapist then please get back to me, 
  what i do ? 
  only four comments have been removed in this whole submission , and several of those are by automoderator . 
  good trip or bad trip ? 
  brb taking a trip to estonia, 
  not that i deny your claim , but i 'd like a source , just for the sake of certainty . 
  that 's interesting and everything , but this has nothing to do with refugees . 
  neither article says anything about the rapist 's reasons for being in germany . 
  nobody is saying he 's a refugee . 
  the article does not say whether he is an immigrant or not ( he could be a tourist , on business , visiting family , etc ) . 
  if you have further information then i 'd love if you would share it . 
  the article does not say whether he is a refugee or not . 
  if you have further information then i 'd love if you would share it . 
  the article does not say whether he is a refugee or not . 
  if you have further information then i 'd love if you would share it . 
  let 's try and have this discussion without resorting to pigeon holing or caricaturing the people we disagree with . 
  it 's the fact that we 're so willing to label everybody as * either * a tumblr sjw * or * a racist which has made this whole debate on immigration and refugees so pointless . 
  if we actually tried to sympathise with what other people are saying and point out false information , etc in a kind and less confrontational manner , then ** maybe ** we would actually learn something and come up with a solution a healthy majority can agree upon . 
  it 's also worth mentioning that pakistan has two hundred * million * citizens , so trying to make any meaningful judgements about this using the fact that they 're a pakistani citizen is like saying `` ah , they 're from the uk+f rance + germany + spain region . 
  of course they would do that . '', 
  it makes no sense because uk+f rance + germany + spain is an incredibly diverse group of people , most of which have almost nothing in common with each other . 
  pakistan is almost equally diverse . 
  i do n't really see why it should be included either . 
  my sympathies are for the woman who nearly got raped and i 'm glad that she was able to defend herself . 
  i do n't care much about the attacker , much less about their nationality . 
  you might as well mention what school they went to , or whether they own a games console , as much as you might mention their nationality . 
  edit : downvotes , really ? 
  have you read the reddiquette ? 
  please use the report function . 
  editorialising, 
  either way , polls on these things before the referendum campaigns have gotten underway are n't really worth much . 
  asking people how they 're going to vote in a year 's or two year 's time , then you might as well be asking them what they 're going to be having for dinner next month . 
  sure , some people will know , but most people will decide when they get there and they know what 's in their fridge . 
  that 's why the specific wording of the referendum question has such a big impact at first , but once there 's been months of campaigning the specific wording matters very little , because people ( well , most of them ) know what they 're voting for . 
  i ask this because these are questions which will no doubt be on the lips of a faction of our user base , and is relevant given criticisms against a former mod of this subreddit ; how would you respond to the accusation that if you `` have no political leanings regarding europe '' that you actually do not know enough about europe to accurately and effectively moderate its discussions ? 
  regarding what else you 've said : how would you respond to the opinion that / r/europe is a european subreddit and therefore , whilst xenophobia and racism against americans is obviously deplorable , the subreddit should nontheless remain a place for europeans exclusively , given that almost the entire rest of site is american by default , plus many european themed subreddits which largely cater to americans such as / r/askeurope ? 
  okay found it . 
  removed flair . 
  i 've had a look through the stream using the ctr + f command with `` referendum '' `` wording '' and `` question '' and ca n't find it in there either . 
  this link does not include the image you have posted . 
  i 've put an ` unsourced ' flair on this submission . 
  if you reply with a source i 'll remove the tag . 
  two questions . 
  you mention that the moderation team is in a bad way/has a bad reputation . 
  what do you think our faults are/were specifically , and what would you have done instead ? 
  secondly , the megathread on the question was not the dual language one . 
  that was about a terrorist attack . 
  we 're referring to the much more recent immigration megathreads which ended two weeks ago . 
  could you give your opinion on that ? 
  yanks are definitely eligible . 
  out of curiosity , which state are you resident in ? 
  the country question was partly to deal with determining people 's time zones . 
  out of interest ( sorry to pry ) do you have any estimates for how many users there were on the garry 's mod and minecraft servers ? 
   not properly on reddit , i have made a sub myself as part of a project with some friends that fell through . 
  i have spent a lot of time as moderators on various online games if that counts for something . 
  out of curiosity , which games ? 
  honest question : how can you know if you use / r/europe on a daily basis , and that you are a committed member of the community , if your account is only two days old ? 
  all comments in this post which are not either applications or questions for an application will be removed . 
  this is simply for applications . 
  if you wish to discuss anything else , please make a different post elsewhere . 
  which sounds like a good idea to me . 
  it 'll take around a decade for this first fusion plant to be operational ( or not ) and at least another decade after that ( if it is successful ) to expand it around europe and the world to quench our electricity needs . 
  on the otherhand , if we directed all of the government subsidies which are being directed towards nuclear research and for the construction of nuclear power plants ( which includes unofficial subsidies , such as that used to build hinckley point in the uk ) towards renewables , then we would likely be running almost completely on renewables even before nuclear fusion reactors would have fulfilled that role . 
  aside from the issue of speed of implementation ( which is extremely important given that the first signs of global climate change are already upon us ) , there 's also many other benefits that pure renewables ( such as hydro , geothermal , wind and solar ) have over nuclear energy : 1 ) most importantly that there is essentially zero risk associated with renewables . 
  nuclear power stations will always have the potential to cause wide ranging nuclear catastrophes , such as happened in fukushima and chernobyl . 
  the safety precautions which have been implemented over time are indeed impressive and i 'll concede that contamination from any particular european plant in the next five years is unlikely , there is however always the potential and unforeseen events will can always happen . 
  ** it 's the difference between using a live fire in your bedroom ( with a great deal of safety measures ) or a radiator which costs the same over the long term . 
  one of them has a small chance of destroying my house and my family with it , whilst the other has a zero percent change . 
  ** i 'll say again that the safety measures in place at modern european nuclear reactors are impressive , but i ca n't help but think that the safety precautions in place at fukushima and chernobyl were also impressive at the time , and only with hindsight can we clearly see the problems . 
  2 ) ** renewables ** can be more evenly distributed so that electricity is created closer to where it is consumed , leading to ** less electricity being lost in transmission ** ( as opposed to a handful of nuclear reactors spread across an entire country ) . 
  3 ) ** renewables have greater potential ** than nuclear . 
  developments , especially in solar technology , have the potential to aid the introduction of ** electric cars and therefore limit our dependence on petrol , and therefore limit petrol 's impact on our environment ** . 
  nuclear power has no such potential , unless you want to start adding mini-reactors to cars , in which case i direct you to point # 1 . 
  but renewables also have wider potential for use in ** developing countries ** , which lack the infrastructure to build nuclear power plants . 
  4 ) ** nuclear power 's association with nuclear weapons will always be a problem ** . 
  yes , in theory there need not be a connection between the two . 
  however , it 's happened too many times in the past that the infrastructure which was created explicitly for the use of nuclear power plants has aided the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
  5 ) ** the issue of nuclear waste ** has still not been adequately solved . 
  * some of the highest living standards on the planet * some of the highest life expectancies on the planet * largest economy in the world i 'd say we 've got most of our problems pretty well sorted out . 
  you can always come up with some tiny problem which needs to be dealt with , but if you look at the big picture , they 're pretty insignificant in comparison to things as fundamental as helping our common human beings and protecting their human rights . 
  ah yes . 
  i applied and became a mod here over a year ago when this sub had less than 70,000 subscribers and a measly growth rate because i could tell , even then , that this would obviously be the perfect way to leap frog a head in my career . 
  yes , i spend hours everyday moderating this place for my own selfish ends . 
  of course . 
  it all makes sense now .
