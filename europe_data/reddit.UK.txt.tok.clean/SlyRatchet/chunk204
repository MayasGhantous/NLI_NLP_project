  a lot of the parties were very much willing to embrace minority government ( e.g. 
  having a labour/conservative party with 40 % of the seats , with snp , greens , plaid and lib dems/lib dems , ukip and dup voting on bills they supported but not taking up government roles ) . 
   i 'm pretty sure most lib dems voted against the conservatives that 's actually not true . 
  the lib dems explicitly said that they were okay coalitioning with either labour or the conservatives . 
  -- anyway , if one party feels as though they are totally , ideologically incompatible with a specific different party , then they absolutely have the right to ignore them in coalition negotiations . 
  that 's what democracy is . 
  the majority get their way , and the minority do n't . 
  if the majority strongly disagree with something the minority has to say , then they never need to listen to them . 
  err ? 
  no you 're being ridiculous . 
  13 % of the electorate voted for sd , but the other 87 % voted against sd . 
  if the other parties coalitioned with them , despite campaigning against all the things sd campaigns for , then * that * would be undemocratic . 
  it 's entirely normal that in a democracy different parties ca n't agree and that some parties should be forced into opposition whilst the parties that do form a coalition get to plough ahead with their policies . 
  * international business times * ? 
  more like * international business lates !, 
  * ^ ( nope . 
  it still sucks . 
  please kill me . ), 
  the british royalty did n't speak the language of the common people for hundreds of years . 
  bringing royal families in from outside is weird , but that 's an entirely different issue . 
  once they 've been there for hundreds of years , they 're not longer outsiders . 
  they my not be well integrated , but they 're still greeks . 
  they reigned in greece for almost 200 years . 
  if your family has live in greece for 200 years , but you happen to be descended from germans ( which is n't even fully the case ) then you 're still greek . 
  [ the queen 's husband , member of the former greek royal family and tywin lannister look-a-like wants a word ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/images/stories/philip4251.jpg ), 
  thank you !, 
  where did you get the quotes from ? 
  -- the police and crime commissioner for kent ( the region where the channel tunnel is ) recently started saying similar things . 
   kent 's police and crime commissioner , ann barnes , has called for ** national funding ** to deal with stack , which is when french-bound lorries park on a closed section of the m20 to await crossings . 
  ( emphasis mine ) source : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-33649334, 
  iirc it has something to do with the mayor of calais deliberately ignoring the crisis because they want it to attract national and international attention . 
  maybe a french person could verify ? 
  i quite like them . 
  they 're trying to get the point across that the some parts of europe are ridiculously over developed whilst some other parts are ridiculously under developed . 
  for a picture , they 've got the point across really well , in a way they just could n't do if they used words . 
  sure , it 's not hugely nuanced , but it 's not meant to be . 
  that 's what the articles are for . 
  the caricatures simply supplement them . 
  so , pretty good imho . 
  the news is n't that the plan exists . 
  the news is that they finalised it ( although i 'm not defending much ib times , because they still have n't explained what they mean by `` finalised '' ) . 
  this infrastructure project has been known about by brussels watchers ever since the european elections . 
  it 's jean-claude junker 's big centre piece policy . 
  he ( representing the european commission ) puts up a few billion euros , and then banks put up the rest , which is used to prop up the european economy . 
  it 's a very ideologically coherent piece of legislation from the centre/centre-right . 
  the more greeks smoke , the more die , and that means less lazy greeks weighing down the welfare bill ** / s ** or at least that seems to be some of the logic i see quite often, 
  i 'm currently on the fourth book . 
  ned and tyrion and snow are still pretty unambiguously good characters . 
  the original thing is well worth a look . 
  the fact that there 's so many gifs and parodies of it is a testament to how fantastically it was filmed . 
  the thing i always find shocking about the film , is that it sort of makes you empathise with hitler on a human level . 
  now , you can sit back in your armchair and thing `` well , obviously he is human and i 'm sure it was very sad for him at the end but deserved it blah blah blah '' it 's an entirely different thing to actually watch a film and have it * make you * *** feel *** * sad * for hitler and his entourage . 
  it 's a truly excellent blending together of history , character and screen writing . 
  delisted for lacking a source . 
  and for the title being entirely ambiguous to what it actually means ( what time period is this referencing ? ), 
   people with `` one-euro-jobs '' do n't count , i thought that germany was phasing in a minimum wage ? 
  whoever decided to put germany right in the middle of europe was a genius . 
  there 's this nice little nugget of information in there as well  radio chisinau reported the parties had agreed to no longer appoint people to key institutions including the central bank , the anti-corruption prosecutor 's office and the general prosecutor post . 
  nominations will now be selected on professional criteria . 
  seems like a distinctive move towards progress . 
  he absolutely is fair game for criticism , but is this really criticism ? 
  it 's artwork or propaganda ( or maybe both ) . 
  i 'm really skeptical of its value in a discussion forum . 
  as far as i can see , it 's just quite a visually pleasing way of saying `` look !, 
  putin war ! '', 
  it 's more that i 'm trying to ensure the subreddit does n't get brigaded . 
  larger subs attract brigading like flies to a piece of fruit , but if we know where the brigades are coming from , then we can filter out their effects . 
  out of curiosity , where did you get linked from ? 
   [ good ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20130912125947/http://www.reddit.com/r/europe )  [ times ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20130820133225/http://www.reddit.com/r/europe ) i honestly do n't see that much difference between these archived links and today . 
  sure there are minor differences , but if you actually look it 's not some big seismic change like you 're claiming . 
  the main differences are in the comments section , not the front page . 
  not yet . 
  i 'll obviously chat to the main mod of / r/greece because he 's also a moderator here , but i 've tried contacting the mods of / r/iama before and it was met just completely ignored , worse than when i 've tried contacting official places , where i could actually understand if they ignored me completely . 
  so i 'm not hopeful we 'll get anything from the / r/iama lot . 
  heh if we somehow manage to get yanis varoufakis on our subreddit , trust me , we 'll be making sure everybody knows that it 's happening . 
  there 'll be confetti and trumpets everywhere, 
  i thought that was mostly fascist nationalists and somewhat nationalist rebels against each other with a bunch of civilians and muslim civilians in the middle, 
  just imagine how that admin conversation went down * hey guys , is de_iama a country ? 
  * * well , i do n't do n't know that it 's not a country . 
  best err on the side of caution and make it one . 
  * * great . 
  well . 
  that 's the geo-defaults sorted . 
  now let 's go and work on some other random crap that helps nobody * * why do n't we give the moderators that one simple tool that they 've been asking for for three years solid that will take five minutes to make and implement ? 
  * * get the fuck out of my sight and start working on redditmade and that one button website which serves no purpose whatsoever *, 
  whys something going to need to be unstickied ? 
  you mean the * sole * destroyer ? 
  edit : the comment i replied to has been deleted ( do n't know why ) . 
  it was some text saying `` actual best plug '' and then a picture of the famous three pronged british plug . 
  yeah , if it happens it 'll cause a lot of traffic , but the thing about moderating is that it 's not so much the amount of * users * that 's the problem , but the amount of time sat at a desk with the ability to read reddit comments for hours . 
  additionally , it 's only comments which are getting up votes which are necessary to moderate . 
  if there 's over 500 comments in the thread , then the bad ones just get sent to the bottom . 
  anyway , in all the amas we 've done in the past , even if they have created significant traffic , have not caused problems . 
  i think we can handle it . 
  if you 've gotten any nasty pms like that , * please * report them to us . 
  such harassment is against our rules and against reddits rules . 
  it only takes a few annoying people like this to ruin something for everyone . 
  please report them . 
  it 's likely not just you they are frustrating . 
  sent .
