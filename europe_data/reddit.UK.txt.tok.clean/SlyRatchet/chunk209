   wheelchair i had no idea that sch\u00e4uble used a wheelchair until you said it just now , and i google some pictures to verify . 
  [ here 's him meeting the former pope ] ( https://publicintelligence.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/vatican-banking.jpg ) [ looking purposeful with angela merkel ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wolfgang+schaeuble+merkel+briefs+media+g20+cwz_f1okvzcl.jpg ) [ this is him spinning around on his wheelchair so fast he 's just a blur ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/10/schauble%20schrodi.jpg ) [ the entire german government , and this time merkel has adopted crunches to make him feel more included ] ( http://cache3.asset-cache.net/gc/464558501-german-chancellor-angela-merkel-stands-on-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=gkzz8bf5zl1ziijumxa7qdkt31skvo10%2byxn%2by1t%2fkm0jvxt%2bzpy0enr%2feagqanc0ovtl%2fev1zaq9yhlr6ijkg%3d%3d ) [ and of course , with varoufakis ] ( http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/462779964-greeces-new-finance-minister-yanis-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=gkzz8bf5zl1ziijumxa7qarc1uuily9e3%2beumf3qd%2fq3zyojjyl561x8n2mthedpv5tv1iyryy2eoht0bny8ua%3d%3d ), 
  i suppose i left out the context . 
  obviously everybody wants a nice balanced budget but the thing that generally distinguishes right wing finance from the left wing ones is a ) that right wingers tend to prioritise a balanced budget over most other things . 
  the spd in germany wants a balanced budget , but they also want to ensure that the weakest in society are better protected e.g. 
  through a minimum wage and that the environment is protected e.g. 
  through sigmar gabriel 's energiewende ( although that seems to be dead in the water now ) . 
  b ) the ways which right wingers want to balance the budget usually centre around their view of society , which puts the blame and responsibility for budget stability on the poorest in society , and penalises them not for working . 
  you can see this in germany and in the uk through the introduction of hartz-v and universal credit respectively . 
  both of these are new ways to deal with welfare , which have limited the amount of welfare individuals can get from the state , because right wingers tend to have a strong believe that welfare causes laziness , and is a `` perverse incentive '' not to work . 
  left , wingers on the other hand , want to balance the budget by * stimulating * the economy and making people spend more . 
  they do n't take such a negative view of welfare and believe that it is a way for the state to help people into work , and to ensure that they have enough money to spend whilst they are in work ( e.g. 
  through in work benefits and through the minimum wage ) . 
  left wingers tend to believe in jobs creation programmes , which will lead to more people having more higher paying jobs which means the government will take in more taxes which they can use to pay off the deficit . 
  wolfgang sch\u00e4uble obviously takes the right wing approach . 
  he 's not especially good at it , but he 's not especially bad either . 
  it 's just a very orthodox right wing response to being a finance minister . 
   he is brilliant in finance eh , i 'd question that . 
  he 's an orthodox monetarist who likes a balanced budget . 
  that does n't make you a good finance minister . 
  it just makes you quite right wing one . 
  as another native speaker nation : serving the whole country nationalised : being owned by the country/state national is the appropriate adjective, 
  what did i just watch ? 
  [ apparently greece uses french sign language , which is quite comment throughout southern europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/sign_language_families.svg ) , but which is less common in northern and eastern europe . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sign_language#classification ), 
  sounds more like something you 'd use in a rhyme . 
  * let 's all moan for the greek loan !, 
  * * they 're all alone , so let 's throw them a bone !, 
  * * all we can do is groan , because merkel 's lookin ' out for her own * -- * grefault , grexit , it 's apoplectic !, 
  * * gregathread , grisis ; shit , they 're actually isis ?!, 
  * * moan and groan , because of the troika loan !, 
  * * instead of the drachma , there 'll be the grachma * * instead of exodus , soon we 'll have deadly grexodus * -- ^ ( can anybody tell i only got a c at gcse english ? ), 
  maybe we should have some sort of pun-off thread where we can get them all out of our system . 
  it 'll be the cringiest thing ever , but glorious, 
  junker does n't use mind games . 
  he just punches their lights out . 
   the dutch police just killed an antillian a while ago * raises pitchfork *  but i think that was strangulation . 
  keep on mind that germany is only one country in this affair . 
  yes , they 're an important country , but still only one . 
  at the end of the day the 18 eurozone states need to agree and the 28 eu member states ( and maybe the parliament and commission as well ) . 
  additionally , keep in mind that whilst the german public and their politicians do n't want to make concessions to greece , most would rather make concessions than have greece leave . 
  who 's `` the [ y ] '' ? 
  13 billion euros of austerity , ** but ** with a haircut on the debt which actually allows for a long term solution . 
  also , the austerity will probably fall in different places . 
  a key point of the agreement at the referendum was on cutting pensions , which syriza * hated * but the troika would n't allow the money to be found from elsewhere . 
  iirc syriza proposed making cuts to armed forces ( greece is one of the highest defence spenders in the eu ) instead , which they 'll probably recommend again, 
  it 's not that some simple , no . 
  similarities : yes , the greek government is expected to institute harsh austerity . 
  the austerity they 're implementing now is actually even harsher than the previously agreed measures differences : however tsipras feels ok agreeing to that because he 's expecting the troika to cut away some of the debt . 
  so what greece is doing is basically the same , but what greece is getting out of this arrangement is much much better ( assuming that the troika agrees ), 
  the grachma , surely, 
  as a mod myself , what you say without the mod hat on still gives an insight into who you are with it on . 
  it 'd be like if i was an elected politician who then went around advocating serial murder , but then said that totally does n't effect my other position . 
  a mod without their green hat and a mod with it are still the same person . 
  most of eastern europe states are really dead set against making further ` concessions ' ( their word ) to greece , but slovenia and some of the baltic states are especially so . 
  basically the way you can divide the various eurozone countries ' responses to the grisis is like this a ) are they the people bailing out everybody else ( germany , the netherlands ) ? 
  -  then they do n't want to make compromises , but they probably will . 
  b ) do they have their own debt crises that they 're dealing with ( italy , spain , portugal ) ? 
  then they 'll be very supportive of greece . 
  c ) are they poorer than greece ( most of eastern europe ) ? 
  then they 'll be similarly reluctant as group a. 
  d ) are they poorer than greece * and have already gone through austerity * ( slovenia , the baltic states ) ? 
  then they will * really * not want to give concessions . 
  i use all the formal , proper words in the link title to lure everybody in , making you think that it 's all serious and everything , and then ** surprise ** greferenda and grises and grefaults * everywhere * !, 
  also , keep in mind that the other gregathread you 're thinking about was quickly pulled together in less than an hour because it was a response to a sudden crisis ( a terrorist attack ) but we 've known that the greferendum and the euro grummits were coming for days in advance . 
  i do n't think syriza ever had any problem with those reforms . 
  it was just that they believed it would be counter productive and ultimately fatal to the greek economy if those reforms were instituted whilst greece still had to pay the same amount of debt back . 
  ever since the referendum , it looks more and more as though syriza really wants a real deal . 
  they 've come to the table with essentially what the troika wanted , they 've had varoufakis resign and tsipras has allowed himself to be directly questioned in front of the european parliament ( which is the first time i 've heard of a sitting head of government going in front of the ep in such a manner ) . 
  added to the op . 
  reminder to everyone that links posted in top level comments will be added to the main post, 
  it 's quite work intensive , but not much more so than the other stuff we do every day . 
  thanks for the appreciation, 
  well if it was n't before , it is now . 
  spread it around like a verbally transmitted disease . 
  if it gets into the dictionary i call dibs on being the first known citation, 
  now that 's just by true . 
  the europar can veto all eu legislation and can impeach the european commission ( which is essentially the eu government ) . 
  id call that pretty powerful, 
  i think there 's already a kick starter, 
  so basically exactly like blair . 
  with blair there was the ` cash for honours ' scandal where people would secrey pay the labour party in order to become ` sits ' and ` dames ' and lords . 
  also , iraq war . 
  also , expenses scandal . 
  but he still won many elections . 
  the thing is , both these guys represent te values of european people . 
  it 's just that they 've tarnished their own names through time and mistakes . 
  if you separate out what these people say from their pasts , then they make a lot of sense, 
  normally farage at least makes sense , but i do n't know what he was trying to say half the time . 
  it was almost entirely sound bite . 
  the euro parliament is usually nowhere near this full , but the members can often be very loud and rowdy as they are being now . 
  the people with the signs are the efdd bloc , which is ukip , and also the europe of freedom and nations bloc which is newly formed with marine le pen of the front national at its head . 
  they basically just use the parliament for political stunts and do n't participate in 90 % of debates . 
  when members of the european commission come to the ep they often turn their chairs away . 
  they also dont vote most of them time but turn up to cash as many checks as possibly under the pretense of demonstrating corruption in europe by doing it themselves . 
  so , those two small blocs at the end are just a bit special . 
  the rest usually behave themselves, 
  sounds a bit like tony blair . 
  both blair and verhofstadt were prime ministers of their countries for a long time . 
  they must have been doing something right of so many people voted for them for so long .
