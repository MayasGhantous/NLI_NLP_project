  actually , i think it will become moderately more diverse/pluralist . 
  all the information is there if you compare and contrast the eurobarameter , conducted by eurostat themselve and the / r/europe survey . 
  look at the question on page 5 `` the image of the european union '' http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb80/eb80_first_en.pdf the responses were : negative ( 28 % ) , positive ( 31 % ) and neutral ( 39 % ) . 
  now , if you look at the / r/europe survey , first question under the ` politics ' topic titled `` my feelings towards the european union are ... '' https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wdxb3lwqtfcbsowwmse5vnnkzqwtcsx3vy0a068zxo8/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics you can see that 66 % of respondents had either positive or very positive feelings towards the european union ( compared to the european average of 31 % ) , 16 % said they were neutral ( compared with 39 % ) , and only 18 % said they had a negative or very negative view of the european union ( compared with 28 % ) . 
  the conclusion i would draw from this , is that the effects becoming a geodefault will pull us closer towards the centre , and that centre is generally less positive across the board , and so we 'll naturally become more eurosceptic . 
  satan seels more papers than snipers . 
  now if it was a terrorist sniper on the other hand ... 
  yeah , i 'm not really a fan of that sub . 
  go to / r/de instead . 
  that 's where everyone is and where all the interesting conversations are, 
  if you 're making a submission to this subreddit , it 's really your responsibility to ensure that what you allege is true , and not leave it up to the users or moderators to verify it for you . 
  that 's not how submissions work . 
  i 'm not going to do the leg work . 
  that 's your job, 
  i 'd still much prefer it if you posted a link from the bbc saying a particular individual tweeted something , rather than going to the offending tweet directly, 
  hi , i 've had to remove this post because it does not have a source . 
  if you want to make this particular piece of new known , please feel free to find it on a reputable news site and then submit that link as a submission . 
  ( note twitter , or facebook , though the bbc or deutschewelle reporting on a tweet is acceptable , because they will have at least fact checked the tweet and lend their authority to its authenticity ) . 
  just a polite reminder to remain civil with one another , no matter how ridiculous the other user may seem . 
  i translated it as ` rescue ' . 
  seems like it 's not so much of a coincidence given the wide array of meanings that word has . 
  hello , moderator here . 
  this submission has been removed because it is from a social media site ( facebook , twitter , ect ) . 
  we do n't accept social media links because they are unreliable . 
  just gon na say that , as a moderator , i love * what happened in your country this week * just as much if not ** more ** than everybody else , 
  i think just about anybody who has experience with computers will know what an admin is , * however * the specific way in which a reddit admin exists is worth them commenting on . 
  in a lot of other online spheres , admins have a much more hands on role with the community and often step in to fulfil moderator duties as well as admin duties . 
  that 's not really the case on reddit so it 's somewhat worth them having an explanation of the distinction between admins and moderators . 
  this was n't an initiative created by the mods at / r/europe , and definitely not one we created in order to solve some kind of mod/user antagonism . 
  this is an idea generated by the reddit admins . 
  the reddit requested that as many subreddits as possible would post this as a sticky for their subreddit for one day , in order to ensure that all the site newbies that have joined in the past long while are properly introduced as to how the site works . 
  this is definitely not some ploy by the mod team to justify ourselves . 
  no matter what reddit app you have , there 'll be an easy way to view the sidebar from within the app . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  the uk is definitely the most american country in europe and definitely co-operate the most , especially on important issues , but there 's usually only * just * enough support in the uk for these things to go a head , where as in the usa a lot of these things have much more consensus . 
  for instance , the iraq war featured the largest protests in british history and has put the entire notion of one of our major political parties into permanent question . 
  the iraq war in the usa was a divisive issue too , but not on the scale it was in the uk . 
  i 'd say the ventures that we have participated in together usually have 80 or 90 percent support in america , but in the uk they either have 60 % and sometimes they only pass by a show string . 
  so it means that despite the actions being the same , our opinions are n't actually quite as aligned as those actions would appear . 
  but kant never says that they just ` ought ' to exist . 
  can you find something where he says that they just ` ought ' to ? 
  lots of philosophers have tried to argue for and find a god independent more truth . 
  personally i think they 're all flawed , but just because i think it 's flawed does n't make it so . 
  we have to accept that it 's an argument that exists for a god independent more truth or god independent human rights , even if we think the logic is flawed.personally i do think kant 's line of reasoning is flawed , but i 've never come across a philosophical school of thought i thought was completely correct either . 
  but i acknowledge , at least , that even if i do n't accept it that it is still a legitimate argument . 
  what you 're saying 's akin to saying that because you do n't accept it it does n't deserve to 've counted . 
  you may not realise this is what you are saying , but that 's certainly what it looks like, 
  just because the usa helped out in the past does n't give them a free card to do as they please in our countries . 
  we 've already repaid our debts to america by a ) not becoming members of the eastern bloc and b ) by repaying our debts because most of the money they gave us were just loans that we had to spend on american products in order to bolster their own economy . 
  the best thing we can do as allies to america at this point is remain staunchly independent and give the american something to measure themselves against and to be critical of one another as allies , because we both become more aware of our wrong doings when we criticise . 
  we owe nothing to one another , apart from the great deal of kindness and empathy that we owe to all human beings . 
  surely , if europe is to federalise , it should n't be called the united states of america . 
  that could cause confusion . 
  i 'm gon na remind you that we have a rule in this sub about being civil to one another . 
  i 've always been somewhat sceptical that cultures are really damaged in anyway by not having their own languages . 
  i think if you look at brazil and portugal , cuba and spain , canada and the usa and ( finally ) the uk and ireland you can see that distinct cultures can exist quite easily in a globalised world without having their own , individual , languages . 
  the countries i 've mentioned are n't ideal examples , because they have such a huge level of shared history and were ( in every instance ) governed from combined place until just a few hundred years ago . 
  but unfortunately we have no current examples of separate cultures that adopted the same language , without having significant shared history . 
  but we are about to start seeing that , and we will very likely see that , for instance , all of the nordic countries retain their distinct cultures despite becoming increasingly english speaking . 
  additionally , i 'd like to get the point across that it is extremely likely that we could have english as a european second language , which everybody learns and knows , whilst the various regional ( national ) languages still exist and are used . 
  catalonia is a good example of this . 
  everybody in catalonia knows and can operate in spanish ( however much they do n't want to , but that 's a political rather than cultural issue ) but lives their daily lives in catalan . 
  this is a model to follow . 
  do you not think it might be beneficial to both german and expat students ? 
  i mean , not only will it give them a lot of practice for general english , it will also ensure that they can talk about their subject at its highest levels of detail in the modern * lingua franca * . 
  this means that people graduating with masters from german universities will be just as qualified for their appropriate fields as someone leaving from a uk or us ( or canadian , australian , new zealand , ect ) university . 
  if you get to a really high level in a subject , you wo n't be able to use that knowledge accurately in a foreign language unless you really work at ensuring you have all the appropriate vocabulary and grammar for that sort of stuff . 
  a , you 're talking about [ epistemology ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epistemology ) ? 
  now that is an interesting field of study ? 
  rationalists , skeptics , empiricists and kantians all fighting it out against each other , arguing for their different conceptions of the universe . 
  the ` discovered ' conception of human rights does n't necessarily imply a believe in a high being . 
  it 's been a while since i studied philosophy , but iirc one of kant 's major achievements was coming up with a justification for morality and human rights independent of god . 
  he was religious and usually factors god in right at the end , but the core of his argument was that humans were essentially rational beings and that as rational beings we have obligations to behave in a certain way generally and their are certain rights that we have in return for being rational agents . 
  it 's worth noting that kant believed in order for a human to be rational they had to be ` free ' and for kant that meant being independent of their desires and intuitions . 
  you had to have restraint in order to be ` free ' , which for kant is what separated us from animals . 
  for kant , free beings ( i think rational agents was the word for it in his lexicon iirc ) both had moral responsibilities ( for instance , never to treat another being as a means to an ends ) but also rights which would be fulfilled by other rational agents . 
  it 's interesting as well that kant believed people had rights * to * things rather than rights * from * things . 
  for instance , in a lot of american conceptions of human rights centre around things are * freedom * *** from *** * government oppression * in other words other entities * wo n't * do certain things to you . 
  you have the right * not * to have certain things done to you . 
  but kant would go so far as saying things like education were rights . 
  he would say that we have a right * to * an education , because education was necessary in order for a being to become a rational agent . 
  so i think rights , for kant , are n't so much things we all have a right to , but things that everybody else has an * obligation * to fulfil for you , just like you have an obligation to fulfil it for them . 
  edit : i also feel it pertinent to say that [ jeremy bentham ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeremy_bentham ) , the founder of utilitarianism and godfather to john stuart mill , also had an interesting conception of god independent rights . 
  his is significantly different to kant 's , because he argues that rights do n't * exist * in the sense that they 're out there and we discovered them , but that they 're a useful concept worth extending . 
  it 's an interesting take on them worth exploring . 
  hello , nice submission . 
  i 've got to ask you as a moderator to post a translation of the title as per [ community guidline one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) . 
  as a user , i thought seeing fully tressed up russian officers ( or , what are ostensibly russian officers ) doing a cool dancing thing like that . 
  flagged as not safe for work . 
  it 's unclear what exactly is going on in the video , but it 's certainly just a little bit over the line as far as gore is concerned . 
  i 've got to admit , i would like to see some more diversity in content . 
  however , there can only be as much news as there are things which are happening . 
  i do n't think much else , europe wise , is happening , now that the junker appointment is basically finished . 
  how come we ca n't have both ? 
  i think normally we have an intense focus on common issues , but also like to discuss different points of view and diversity . 
  it damages the uk more than other eu states , but all banking related things effect the uk more than the rest of the eu because [ the city of ] london is equal largest financial centre in the world , and in a few categories just edges into a definitive first place . 
  * but * the uk being the global financial centre it is , means that it 's not reliant on russian capital and will pretty easily be able to absorb the losses endured by a cut off to that market . 
  obviously the city will moan and david cameron will be doubly sympathetic a ) because free markets is a cornerstone of modern ( large c ) conservatism and b ) because the conservatives have far too many dubious links with russians who finance their party . 
  * however * david cameron 's already been making increasingly eager noises about the russia situation and it will be hard for him defend himself against opposition criticisms when they start bringing up the several britons who were killed in flight mh17 as a result of russian intervention in the ukraine . 
  so ** tl ; dr : ** it 's quite likely that the uk government will stomach the relatively minor losses endured on the financial sector and go through with the financial sanctions .
