  and the / r/europe mods , as well as every other mod across the site , gets similar treatment . 
   the company behind reddit does n't care what you do for a day anyway , the admins have been posting and commenting across reddit constantly since this crisis started , and even made progress towards providing some of the things we wanted in comments on private mod subs like / r/modtalk and / r/defaultmods . 
  so i think they care what we do for a day . 
  it sent a message and it was received loud and clear . 
  -- plus , if we did n't moderate for a day , the sub would very slowly but very ** permanently ** go to shit . 
  it would n't have the shock and awe of a blackout , which is what we needed . 
  news just in : productivity in europe increases by 0.1 % in the second third quarter !, 
  likely caused by the mass blackout on reddit of 3/7/15, 
   it should obviously be noted , that said post was only up for what , an hour , maybe two , before the subreddit was closed . 
  not much time to gather additional posts . 
  like i said , there was no time to wait and pontificate and allow people to make up their minds and vote . 
  i would have liked to have participated in a week long discussion regarding the various perspectives , but when you 've been watching the crisis unfold throughout the night , and you have to make a decision there and then , you 've just got to make a decision and i think we made the right one . 
   closing the entire subreddit over a person nobody knows the dismissal of / u/chooter was not the primary reason . 
  that was just the straw that broke the camel 's back . 
  the reasons were because communication between mods and admins is virtually non existent , and our mod tools are shit . 
  the removal of / u/chooter was aggravating simply because she was one of the few admins who actually communicated with the community and the mods , and now she 's gone and there 's nobody really to replace her ( apart from some token character and a generic email address which were both added hastily in response to the protest ) . 
   and issues only the mods face these are n't problems only the mods face . 
  our inability to moderate effects * you * . 
  if we ca n't ban users who go around trolling you and spreading around your personal information , then this is a problem that effects you . 
  we need the ability to ban these people and deal with alternate accounts , but currently we ca n't because the admins ignore our requests and do n't give us the ability to do so . 
  this is just one of the many ways the problems the mods face could effect * you * . 
  can confirm ; have to say blimey or bloody or bloomin ` eck instead . 
  you 're aware that that post has less than 100 comments , but this subreddit has 380,000 subscribers ? 
  we get about a thousand views a every fifteen minutes during the day . 
  i do n't think that that thread was representative . 
  we were watching it to try and gauge community interest at the time , but , obviously , basically all of / r/europe was asleep at the time ( because this was a crisis happening in america , not europe ) . 
  the protest was well underway at that time and we had to choose either whether to join it or not . 
  we could have organised a vote , but that would have taken far too long and the protest would have fizzled out by then . 
  so we had to take an executive decision , which we did . 
  it remains to be seen what the majority opinion is . 
  maybe when we finally do the / r/europe survey we 'll find out . 
  because the problems we face are not problems the community can fix . 
  they 're things only admins can fix , which is why we are so frustrated that they are too negligent to help us when we need them , or even to give us the tools to do the job ourself . 
  that 's sort of , kind of the point . 
  the blackout originally started because / r/iama , / r/books and / r/science ( some of the largest subs on reddit ) were suddenly unable to do their amas , which are an integral part of all those subs . 
  this effectively shut them down . 
  so they decided to * actually * shut down , to demonstrate to the admins and to the wider reddit community what it was * effectively * happening . 
  that 's what the protest was about . 
  you can say it was the wrong decision , but you ca n't say it was something we did on our own behalf . 
  we moderate every day because we love the communities we moderate and we want to help them . 
  we believe that it 's almost impossible to moderate effectively because of the lack of tools we have and the lack of mod-admin communication . 
  therefore , we protested to get the admins attention so that we can serve our communities , and therefore our users , better . 
  if we wanted to serve our own interests , we 'd just quit and enjoy some time relaxing , rather than sorting through the one millionth spam report . 
  no , that 's correct  i made a typo . 
  i somehow mixed the snoo and chooter in my head . 
  corrected now, 
  anybody able to provide a translation ? 
  if you 're a moderator you could comment your agreement to it here https://www.reddit.com/r/slyratchet/comments/3by8bv/declaration/, 
  you 're aware that reddit only has about 30 members of staff , and that almost non of them have any involvement with the day to day running of the site ? 
  the moderators do ** all of that ** . 
  we fucking run this site , just because we want to see it do well . 
  we'er not doing it because we want more powers . 
  we 're doing it because we want to make reddit better , and at the moment we ca n't . 
  we 're not asking for much . 
  we 're hardly asking for anything . 
  we just want the admins to communicate with us , and maybe give us a few new tools and make the old ones actually usable . 
  moderating at the moment is like trying to heard sheep , whilst finding a needle in a haystack and having your teeth pulled out . 
  it 's not so much to ask that we actually have the resources to do what needs to be done . 
  the admins just do n't recognise that because they never bloody talk to us . 
  the point is more generally that we need to find some way to stop some alts from working . 
  even if we make it slightly more difficult , that will still deter most alternative account users . 
  we need bans that actually * work * . 
  otherwise , how can we do our job ? 
  anyway . 
  do n't pick it to death because of one proposal . 
  they 're just recommendations . 
  we 're not expecting all of them to be made good on , and even then , the most important ones are about communication, 
  only when it is used to circumvent subreddit bans . 
  i 've finish the full thing and am currently sending it around to moderators so they can put their names to it . 
  in the full thing it includes a more precise definition of the objective . 
  that being , essentially , that we want to be able to ban users based on ips ( to a certain extent ) . 
  the point is more that the admins do n't communicate with the mods , and this is causing us to be shitty mods because they do n't provide us with the tools to do anything nor the ability to ask for help when we need it . 
  ama has had to shut down because they ca n't work without this admin , and a very important ama was cancelled because it was sudden and without communication . 
  we are protesting because we want reddit to do well . 
  but the administrators are stopping us from doing that by not providing mods , who do most of the work on this site , with the tools we need . 
  no idea . 
  i do n't know if they were private before . 
  that 's just what i heard . 
  i mean , i know i 've never been to / r/spain but i 've been to virtually every other national subreddit, 
  i thought / r/spain was private anyway ? 
  there 's actually a lot of good reasons for / r/europe to black out , which essentially boil down to , we do n't believe we have the necessary equipment to moderate . 
  it 's one of the reasons we 've been pushed to do things which have been accused of censorship here 's a declaration i am trying to get in order -- why has the blackout happened ? 
  the key points we would like to say are 1 ) whilst this protest initial began because of the dismissal of victoria from the administration team , it is not the primary cause , it is merely the straw that broke the camel 's back 2 ) we feel as though reddit 's communication with moderators as well as with the wider community , has been lacking . 
  this is exemplified by the fact that victoria was one of the few admins who regularly communicated with moderators . 
  subs such as / r/iama relied on her to help facilitate their amas , and the fact she was dismissed without notice is not only an insult , given that reddit has poorly communicated its decision to dismiss a major communicator , but has also lead to many amas needing to be cancelled , which could have been avoided simply by forewarning 3 ) we love reddit . 
  we love the community and the functions it provides . 
  that 's why we moderate . 
  we give up our free time to do this out of a sense of fun and a desire to do something good ; to make and facilitate the growth of communities we love . 
  we wish reddit no harm . 
  we wish it every prosperity . 
  4 ) however we feel unable to do this due to the lacking communication of the administrators during times of crisis , which they can easily fix ( e.g. 
  brigading and removal of alternative accounts ) . 
  and the tools we are given in order to fulfil our function as custodians of the communities is hindered by the fact that we have such limited tools to do that . 
  5 ) we are protesting to draw attention to this . 
  many moderators feel unable to accurately do our job because of these conditions , and we want the wider reddit community to know that , and we want the admins to fix that . 
  this is a plea for reddit . 
  this is a protest to draw attention . 
  mods are often criticised , but we are forced usually into the actions we take because of our severely limited resources . 
  6 ) there 's two ways this can be fixed : either , the admins give us the powers to run these subreddits effectively , or create a layer of community admins who can deal with moderator requests ( or a mixture of the two ) we have provided a list of recommendations ( and that 's all these are ) below . 
  7 ) we would also like to announce pre-emptively that we know the administrators `` are working on '' these tools , but if that is indeed the case , then we would at least appreciate a genuine progress report , and insight into how far it is actually going a long .
