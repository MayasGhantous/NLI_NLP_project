  as someone who 's involved with this , it 's really not apparent that they were being sarcastic . 
  there 's a lot of people who would say that seriously . 
  as a moderator with a lot of sympathies with the protest , yeah , that 's a bit stupid . 
  pao is n't hitler , or anything close . 
  i just think the admins are n't good at their jobs . 
  you 've got to keep in mind that a lot of the things north korea does are okay in the eyes of most of the world . 
  people who live outside of the liberal , western democratic countries do n't really care that north korea is authoritarian with no democracy , despite both of those things seeming barbaric to you and me . 
  now , the stuff that almost everybody accepts to be wrong , like human experimentation , has only circumstantial evidence at this point . 
  what we need to do is keep building up evidence , more and more , until the only way allies reason north korean allies can honestly give for their support of north korea is mutual self interest . 
  then , you can simply offer them something better , and take down north korea with a conventional war . 
  i know that a lot of people are making funny answers , but i think there 's actually a few very good reasons to bring this to the european parliament over other places . 
  * the reason the ** european parliament ** was picked over organisations like the un is because the ** un is n't ** *** really *** ** an investigational organisation like a parliament ** is . 
  parliament literally means `` speaking place '' and they hold debate , discussion and the value of information to be paramount . 
  parliaments are there to make decisions , but they 're not just for that , otherwise there 'd be no need for discussions . 
  decisions are directionless without evidence to guide them . 
  an organisation like the un is * just * about making decisions . 
  it does have some investigative abilities , but that 's not its primary purpose and it can be used to snuff out debate as much as spur it on . 
  there are a lot of risks with going to the un , but going to a parliament gives you a better chance of getting a real , credible investigation . 
  * ** why pick the european parliament over other parliaments like in finnland or the usa ? 
  ** because the european parliament is * very * pluralistic . 
  the ep represents more people than any other parliament on the planet except for india . 
  this means that the parliament can investigate the evidence using the perspectives of 28 different countries . 
  what 's more , once the investigation is done , it will be credible in all of those 28 countries ( which consists some of the most powerful nations in the world , including two un security council members ) . 
  in addition to the ep 's wide range of views regarding the large population and number of nations it represents , it also has an extremely diverse array of ideologies present in the parliament . 
  there will be 28 national perspectives , but there 's also a socialist , green , social democratic , liberal , christian conservative , progressive conservative nationalistic and authoritarian blocs in the european parliament , as well as many non-enscrypts and independents which adds further legitimacy . 
  the information will be evaluated and discussed by this huge pool of different ideological perspectives . so ** the european parliament is not impartial , but multipartial ** , in a way that no currently existing national parliament is . 
  this is important because there is no currently existing investigative organisation which all of the countries involved would call truly impartial or neutral , as i explain in my next point . 
  * the reason that the ** courts ** are n't seen as viable either , is because almost all court systems operate according to one country 's law . 
  if the uk courts , for instance , did the investigation , it would still get called partial by north korea and its allies . 
  what 's more , the information would not be anywhere near as highly publicised , nor would it be as highly compatible with so many different different nations . 
  it ca n't be processed through european level courts either , because the european court of justice is about safe guarding the eu treaties ( the eu constitution ) and the european court of human rights only applies to signatories of the european convention of human rights ( of which north korea is n't ) . 
  i 'm not even 100 % that the echr has the ability to conduct investigations . 
  the international criminal court may be able to do it , but it would again have trouble broadcasting the information outwards and making it accessible , and they can only start investigations ( iirc ) if a signatory country accuses another country of human rights abuses and takes the country to court , and i 'm not sure anybody has actually taken north korea to court yet . 
  ** so a court investigation would be seen as both partial/biased , just like if a small national parliament conducted the investigation , with non of the benefits of conducting it in a parliament ** . 
  so there it is . 
  the european parliament is arguably the best organisation for this . 
  no action will come directly from this , but no action was going to come directly from this * anyway * . 
  we knew that these things were happening . 
  this just gives us the proof . 
  proof does n't build rockets , but it does change people 's minds , and when enough people 's minds are changed then action can happen . 
  this is just a further step down that road . 
  the information needs to be documented , and publicised by as impartial or as multipartial organisation as possible . 
  that will give this information the most value , which will give it the best chance of , one day , causing action . 
  the un security council 's actions also have no effect if the un general assembly ( which is basically a legislature with one representative for every single country ) does n't pass the motion . 
  plus , the un security council does n't only consist of the five giants ( uk , usa , france , russia and china ) . 
  it 's jst that those are the only permanent members and they have veto power . 
  there 's also a further five or ten members who rotate every few years and can vote down resolutions in the council, 
  i 'm dissatisfied with the cloudy weather normally , but * now * i am actively * displeased * . 
  i 'd rather be distasitisifed with the cold , than positively in pain with the heat . 
  there 's probably two things : * the difference between london and the rest of the country may just happen to fall on the line where the colour gradient on the map shifts . 
  it looks to me like the map changes colour for every 3 or 5 degrees or so , and london is normally two degrees hotter than other parts of england ( although this is partially down to london being in the south ) . 
  if the colour gradient goes 0-5 , 5-10 , 10-15 , 15-20 , 20-25 , 25-30 , 30-35 , 35-40 then london could be at 31 , whilst the rest of the uk is at 29 , but both appear to be very different . 
  it could be the same only your country is 36 , but your city is 38 ( meaning their in the same gradient ) . 
  * it 's partially to do with london 's shear * size * . 
  like , london is so big you can literally see it from space , in the day time . 
  it encompasses a huge area , and as such the the termpature differences are both greater , but also effect a larger geographic area due to london being physically bigger . 
  this means that it shows up on maps as an obvious outlier , whilst your city may be too small to show up on a national map . 
  i 've not seen a catalan rage thread in a while , which is a shame , because catalan rage threads are some of my favourite . 
  thanks !, 
  ** puts ordinary redditor hat on ** it 's just that a lot of people only skim read articles for the important points ( e.g. 
  for longer articles that do n't seem * that * interesting i just read the first paragraph , one or two in the middle , and the last paragraph ) . 
  additionally , it 's pretty obvious * to us * that it 's satire , but there 's a thousand new people in this subreddit everyday , many of whom may be getting aware of this crisis for the first time , and it would be a shame to accidentally lead any large number of people astray . 
  anyway , just thought i 'd say why i think it 's a good idea to put a `` satire '' disclaimer on the article . 
  could you please put a disclaimer in the first line ( preferably in bold ) that this is an a satire piece . 
  i 've put a `` humour '' tag on this already , but currently i 'm not sure if anybody reads the flairs due to their very bland appearance . 
  are the quotes they use actual quotes , or are they invented for comedic purposes ? 
  the way the eu functions today is extremely similar to how the usa functioned at its conception . 
  * originally the senate was appointed by the governors of the states ( the same way the german bundesrat is appointed by the bundesl\u00e4nder ) . 
  this is exemplified by the council of ministers/council of the european union , where the individually elected heads of government of eu states get together to vote and amend eu legislation . 
  * the us house of representatives was meant to direct the interests of the us public directly , regardless of state . 
  this is broadly fulfilled by the european parliament , which is directly elected and is arguably the most powerful branch of eu governance , short of the member states themselves . 
  also , the europarl actually does a better job of this because it uses proportional representation , rather than fptp , which can and is easily gerry mandered . 
  * the presidency of the us is the only with which there is a significant difference . 
  the usa is a presidential republic , where as the eu is a parliamentary one . 
  as such , the the head of the executive branch ( usa : the presidency . 
  eu : european commission ) is appointed by the european parliament , where as in the usa it is directly elected . 
  again , this is because europeans tend to believe in unified government . 
  we do n't like the idea of one branch of government being able to hold everything back and cause government shut downs . 
  the european parliament can also force the resignation of the european commission . 
  the european commission is the only branch which can propose ( start ) legislation ( after which the council of ministers and the europarl must both agree ) . 
  * supreme court : again , we have the european court of justice for the protection of the eu constitution ( which are called the eu treaties ) and a weird separate court called the european court of human rights which exists outside the eu , but all eu member states must be a party to it . 
  so we have two supreme courts for different functions , where as the usa only ever had one , but the same services are essentially being carried out . 
  one last point , you have to keep in mind that the dominance of the us federal government in washington is a very new developed . 
  it 's only really been around since the 1930s , with president fdr . 
  before that point you had `` dual federalism '' which was basically a lot like the eu , in that the us federal government virtually did nothing except for foreign policy , regulating inter-state and international trade , controlling the currency , and that was about it . 
  a us wide police force only came into effect in the 1920s ( in the form of the fbi ) . 
  the only * real * difference between the early usa and the current european union [ aside from the eu obviously being better  ] is that eu member states nominally have the freedom to leave the eu at anytime , where as us states have never had the right to secede ( and have fought wars over the matter ) . 
  yeah . 
  personally i find hardcore maths to be much more like philosophy than people give it credit for ( more specifically i think maths is a branch of philosophy ) . 
  i mean , the way that you explore philosophy and maths both basically consist of sitting in a room and trying to think about things really hard in a logical and consistent manner to solve problems . 
  they 've both seem to apply to everything and nothing simultaneously . 
  like , you ca n't go out and * prove * that 1 plus 1 equals twos just like you ca n't go out and prove that murder is wrong , but you can think about it and come up with models and proofs through intellectual pursuits . 
  science , on the other hand , is basically about using the scientific method to gather evidence and create theories based on what 's observed . 
  where as maths and philosophy are basically all about the theory itself . 
  therefore i 'd arguer that economics is probably the closest thing to a science that veraufakis studies , in that it actually tries to change its opinions based on whats observed and various models can be proven wrong based on evidence gathering ( i.e. 
  the scientific method ) . 
  -- all of that said , i still think having a phd in economics and a masters in maths demonstrates that you 're probably a pretty smart person . 
  it may not be science , but that 's not a criticism . 
  race car driving and martial arts are very different skills , but both of them are impressive in a similar way . 
  it 's the same with being a high functioning mathematician and being a scientist .
