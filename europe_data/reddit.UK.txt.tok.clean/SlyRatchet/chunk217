  that 's one of the tools . 
  there 's all sorts of variables that you have to factor in though , to determine whether the drop ( or lack thereof ) is indicative of anything . 
  i said '' * good * people '' . 
  most people are n't good moderators . 
  sounds like you were n't very good at it if you do n't know how to spot a brigade . 
  i 've explained in another comment that we actually do have the abilities to detect it , but we are simply unable to explain them because that would compromise their effectiveness . 
  it would be like saying we know where hitler 's bunker is because our spy gave us the documents , thereby demonstrating that we 're getting our information from a spy . 
  in any case , brigading does happen ( there are stormfront threads about it which i can link you to ) and it does need to be dealt with . 
  there are a mixture of methods which we can use to quite accurately predict brigading . 
  the most obvious is that we can look for an initial thread elsewhere on the internet which is the source of the brigade , but we actually also have a diverse array of ways to detect brigades by using the very limited amount of information which is available to us . 
  however i ca n't say what those specifics are , because if they become known then brigaders will be able to use this information to circumvent to these methods in the future , and we 're all better off if that does n't happen . 
  i have answered you 're question , it 's just that the answer is very complicated . 
  unfortunately , moderation generally is very complicated . 
  like i said : the type of censorship which fnsv is talking about does n't exist imho . 
  it 's other sorts of content removals which we do that look like censorship but serve a legitimate purpose . 
  you 've really got to read my main post if you want to understand where i am coming from . 
  and as for the delisting of this post : it was a temporary measure ( for a few minutes ) to measure traffic levels . 
  normally it 's so brief that people do n't notice . 
  it 's been relisted to now . 
  it 's just a procedure . 
  we delisted it for a few minutes to check traffic levels . 
  you 'll notice it 's back up now . 
  it works here too  we leave messages 90 % of the time when we remove a submission . 
  but we do get a lot of hate mail for it . 
  i 've only been called sub human twice today , and got only a single death threat !, 
  anybody ever wonder why so few good people want to be moderators ? 
  we leave a notifying message in 90 % of cases . 
  essentially , i 'm trying to say that i do n't believe `` censorship '' like the op understands it , is happening . 
  the three major kinds of censorship i mention : anti-brigading , megathreads and anti-violence , all predominantly effect posts relating to islam and immigration for all sorts of different reasons . 
  this means that we remove posts about islam and immigration more so than posts about other subjects . 
  if you look at the front page today , and in previous days and in the coming days , you will see that there are * loads * of posts about immigration and islam . 
  why is that ? 
  because we 're not censoring them and because we 're not shoving them under the rug . 
  we simply remove things which fall foul of those three categories, 
  hi , as a moderator i 'm just gon na provide a quick explanation of the way we see things . 
  very little of what we do is censoring . 
  99 % of content which we remove , is removed for reasons that have nothing to do with the opinions it espouses . 
  it 's usually stuff like ** editorialising , spam and lacking sources ** . 
  this is 99 % of what us moderators do , and we do a pretty good job of keeping this stuff away imho . 
  now , ** brigading ** is also very important and it is very difficult to counter act and it takes up a disproportionate amount of our time . 
  when we believe threads being brigaded from outside , by groups with a particular opinion ( and we now that storm front and others do this to our subreddit specifically ) , we * have * to act . 
  because what is happening there is * not free speech * . 
  when a brigade is happening , the speech is about as free as trying to have a reasonable conversation whilst a crowd of people around you shout so loud that your voice is drowned out . 
  in these instances , you need moderation to pro-actively step in and ensure that free speech can take place . 
  free speech is not simply an absence of formal restrictions . 
  there are also practical restrictions , like actually ensuring that your voice can be heard . 
  this is where some degree of moderation is necessary , because if it was left purely to its own devices , then we would be constantly brigaded and no genuine discussion would take place . 
  connected to this is why we do ** megathreads ** . 
  it 's very easy for one issue to dominate the sub 's front page , and for it to dominate the front page for a very long time . 
  you could see this with the ukraine crisis for months , and this is happening now with immigration . 
  very little discussion of anything else can take place because we 're being drowned out by the flood of small news stories which are part of one big story . 
  but we want to ensure that not only a diversity of opinion can be achieved , but also a diversity of news ( and even of types of content that are n't news ) . 
  this is why we do ** megathreads ** . 
  it 's not to sweep things under the rug . 
  it 's to bring attention to it , and to focus that attention in once place . 
  by focusing the attention , it allows other news stories to blossom whilst there is a big main story as well . 
  now , today it may not have been carried out in the most effective way possible , and we 'll try and do better in future , but you can see what we were trying to do . 
  i 'm thankful that clauzel took the prerogative to make that post , even though it was n't perfectly carried out . 
  we also remove the stuff ** which advocates violence ** , because advocating violence is essentially the same thing as committing a violent act . 
  we do n't want that sort of thing to be spread around here . 
  we do not want to be facilitators of violence and pain and suffering . 
  do not go anywhere near that . 
  but connected to this is the idea of hate speech . 
  as much as it displeases me , there are many movements which advocate violence against people based on race . 
  virtually all of the things which we remove because of their advocacy of violence are related to race . 
  you can discuss race as much as you want , but if you go anywhere near even thinking about mixing violence in with it , then you can go somewhere else . 
  lastly , as a general response to all the complains we get , i 'd like to point out that the * only * time you hear about our work is when something bad happens or we make a mistake . 
  and yes . 
  we make mistakes . 
  we are human too . 
  the thing is , there 's several of us working on here every day , doing work that you never see , which ensures that this subreddit operates smoothly and continuously . 
  you may not think much of it , but that has an enormous impact on the quality of this subreddit , even though you never hear about it . 
  me too . 
  it is an opportunity for me to practice my other languages , and avoid the typical english monolingualism . 
  maybe other native english speakers will take up the cause -- * ich auch . 
  question : how do y' all feel about people writing in their native english , but then translating into a somewhat random third language bellow , that they may not be 100 % fluent in ? 
  we 've not been ignoring it . 
  i 've literally never seen this before . 
  it 's impressive . 
  i 'll bring it to the attention of some of the others at / r/europedev . 
  thanks for doing this, 
  can confirm ; supported dclauzel as mod . 
  everything is working perfectly . 
  you 've not really explained why it 's not a perk , because your whole comment sort of assumes that you ca n't understand what he 's saying , which you can , because he always writes in both . 
  if the information is so easily and readily available , then it should be no problem for the ops to quickly link to the source themselves . 
  the mods already do n't have enough time to adequately fulfil the things that only moderators can do ( such as removing editorialising , banning hate speech , finding brigades , et al ) without us * also * having to track down every source for the redditors . 
  for an op , it takes less than five minutes ( assuming the source is easy to find , like you say ) but a moderator might have to carry out this action multiple times a day * every day * . 
  and it 'll take a moderator a lot longer to find the source because they do n't know where the op got the thing from in the first place . 
  it 's just a really , ** really ** inefficient use of moderator time to be looking for sources when the op can , and should just simply post where they found the information when the post their submission . 
  that 's what it says to do in the rules . 
  i do it by the book because by the book is the only way to do things . 
  i do n't give special concessions to some people , but be more strict on others . 
  my only commitment is to creating a good subreddit , with a high quality of discussion and content . 
  that is best achieved by having highly sourced content , where the users can go and check out the sources , and where the moderators and the users both work cohesively together to ensure that that is the case . 
  i endorse the decision to allow this post , and more posts like it in the future . 
  obviously i took a very narrow reading of our rules at first , but after having discussions with the other moderators i 'm prepared to accept that we need to take a more inclusive position . 
  sorry but there is already a near identical submission on the front page so this has been delisted to ovoid over crowding http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b6ns1/liveupdate_gunmen_have_attacked_tourist_hotels_in/, 
   ( s ) he 'll remove any submission that does n't provide a source , because if it does n't have a source it 's as good as false . 
  with many ******** 's, 
  i do n't think so .
