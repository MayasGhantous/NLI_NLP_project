   so de facto bern is the capital ( hosting the main federal government bodies ) , but de jure there is no capital . 
  * in that case i 'd argue that kharkiv should also count because the ukraine ssr was subsumed by the ussr . 
   i know geology is often dismissied in geography , but if you look at it , it is crucial to the forming of political entities and understanding it helps you see certain things . 
  just look at all those straight lines in north africa . 
  do n't see geology having much of an effect there ;d, 
  what do you mean increasing difficulty ? 
  it gets * waaay * easier towards the end . 
  i ca n't answer any of the first four but i can tell you that the only city which has never been a capital is saint petersburg ( or failing that , kharkiv ) . 
  ( florence was the capital of either italy , or an italian state , bonn was capital of west germany , bern is the current capital of switzerland ) . 
  i feel like i know the albanian capital but i just ca n't quite say it ... 
  i 'm much more of a political geography nerd . 
  the evolution of tectonic plates is just a mine field, 
  yeah , as a northerner i 'd consider # 2 for a pint to be normal , and would grumble if it was any higher . 
  the prospect of it being over twice as much is ... unpleasant . 
  i ca n't imagine how people from belgium or germany would feel about it . 
  yeah , but everything else costs a tonne . 
  it can be # 5 for a pint !, 
  i mean [ just look at this price comparison between an average uk city like newcastle and london ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=united+kingdom&amp;country2=united+kingdom&amp;city1=newcastle+upon+tyne&amp;city2=london ) . 
  and the uk is already a quite expensive country by european standards . 
  it 's nowhere near the nordic level of sweden and norway , but it 's still generally very high . 
  also , there 's the currency conversations which will bite all non uk / r/europe users in the back because nobody else uses the pound ( where as if we do it in berlin , that 's in the eurozone , which most europeans use , so stops the use of exchange rates ) . 
  i do want to say that even if this gathering falls through , it does n't preclude organising a new one in future with better logistics and planning . 
  i did want to involve myself in the process ( as a mod ) but other restrictions on my time prevented that from happening, 
  yeah , but we want this to be a pan european event and not discriminate in favour of british redditors and against greek ones ( for instance ) . 
  it should be in a place which is accessible to as many parts of europe as possible , and not pay too much attention to where / r/europe 's users come from . 
  additionally , london is n't really a pan-european city in the way that some others like berlin , brussels , luxembourg and strasbourg are . 
  paris and london are obviously amazing european cities , but they are very much british and french , rather than `` european '' ( imho ) . 
  they 're more effected by the histories of their own countries , than the histories of europe , and their mentalities reflect that . 
  i 'd say that we should go somewhere that 's just a little bit symbolic . 
  additionally once more , london is * super * expensive . 
  this has been delisted because a near identical submission is already on the front page . 
  i still think that the meet up should have been in berlin !, 
  unnoficial political capital of europe , after brussels . 
  it 's a bridge between the former east bloc countries and the former west bloc countries . 
  it 's cheap and it 's got loads of history ( and loads of beer ) . 
  also , the train and plane connections are better . 
  yes , but our gdp is also much more evenly spread . 
  we do n't have such extreme disparities in wealth , especially at the top end . 
  whilst america 's gdp per person is higher than the eu 's , most people in the eu actually have a higher standard of living, 
  moldova 's landlocked , but not doubly so , because both ukraine and romania have access to the ocean through the black sea , and then through the bosphorus strait near istanbul * and then * through the strait of gibraltar and the suez canal . 
  with liechtenstein , on the other hand , it is only bordered by austria and switzerland , and both of those countries do not have access to the sea either . 
  alos , i can choose to individually flair my comments with a little button nearby where the `` edit '' button normally is when i feel like behaving like a mod and asserting my authority ( autoriteh ! ), 
  and i can keep my anonymous peasant blue when i want to blend into the back ground and participate in pop quizzes on geography ( the best kind of pop quizzes ) . 
  i was n't trying to be rude !, 
  i was just trying to make a funny !, 
  it sounded funny in english :( * cries under the mountain of pressure *, 
  liechtenstein and one of the stan countries in central asia . 
  i hesitate to call it uzbekistan , but i think it might be, 
  hey did you know there 's a tiny country un between austria and switzerland which is one of only two countries to be double land locked ? 
  i wish i was this easily amused, 
  you have family in mayalsia ? 
  also , one of those names tourists is british , so the news has been big here . 
  did n't think i 'd see it in the french news section :3, 
  ach , i 've forgotten beleidigen and beschimpfen mixed up . 
  it 's hard trying to get nuance into a second language . 
  danke * corrected thank you * * ( how is it that the only time i do dual language in ages you immediately pop out of the wood work ) *, 
  right on top of my house , please . 
  we could include them in a list of subreddits , but not on a map . 
  otherwise we 'd need to add catalonia , and then we 'd need to add wallonia , and then bavaria and then vorarlberg and then the basque country until virtually every devolved administration or federal state has been included . 
  it 's such a slippery slope . 
  only non country entities worth adding are micro states , dependencies and overseas territories because those are all clearly governmentally separate from all other countries , even if they have a sort of host country . 
  that 's so weird . 
  like `` i had sex with this person . 
  would not do again . 
  oral was unsatisfactory and sex was dispassionate . '', 
  i 'd be weird writing a review , let a lone reading one, 
  the current european flag is * way * better though . 
  i 'm glad we have the twelve stars in a circle . 
  plus i think the alaskan flag + european version is just too messy . 
  if a child ca n't draw something vaguely recognisable , then it 's too complicated ( or at least that 's what / r/vexillology will tell you ), 
  we 'd be no better than the french if we did that , and look what mess they 've themselves into . 
  i mean , you 've got * fran\u00e7ois hollande * as your president !, 
  that looks almost exactly like the [ flag of alaska ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/flag_of_alaska.svg/2000px-flag_of_alaska.svg.png ), 
  yeah that 's an idea . 
  the problem with changing it frequently is that it 'd be difficult to find an image ( or to find the time to photo shop an image ) which would match our colour scheme . 
  one of the reasons this looks so good ( * looks screen intently * ) is that we chose the colours of european flag to be prevalent through out ( blue with patches of gold ) . 
  something symbolic i think is best . 
  but that does n't mean that we ca n't have a special flair for special occasions , like independence days/national days ( queen 's birthday ftw ) . 
  yeah , but what about during the ryder cup ? 
  how would we celebrate that without a european flag ? 
  also , when it was germany vs. brazil i think just about everybody in europe was cheering for german , and could well have cheered using a european flag, 
  how about * all the time !, 
  * but generally i do n't use flag emojis , or emojis at all , that often . 
  but if there 's ever a moment where a european flag would just be perfect , then you 'll be glad it 's there !, 
  rip it down everybody !, 
  back to the drawing board, 
  i did consider that personally , but i think the problem is , if we picked a specific city or land scape it would only be from one european country ( or we could do some ugly photo shopping . . ) . 
  we need something which represents all of europe , which kind of counts geophysical things and cities out of the race, 
  just how imagine how good it 'll be when the new headers and flaires are added !, 
  you 'll be eating the entire computing screen . 
  maybe our header should just be a big warning sign saying `` can have adverse consequences if eaten ! '', 
  sorry but this has been delisted under rule 2.3 . 
  please check up our rules on editorialising . 
  depends which european country and which latin american country . 
  in europe you get the whole range of approaches to prositution which goes like this : ** 1 ) ** complete legalisation and commercialisation , both for organised prostitution ( brothels ) and for individuals , as in germany and the netherlands ; ** 2 ) ** legalisation for for individual prostitutes , but not for brothels ( uk ) ; ** 3 ) ** illegal for the * customer * ( france , sweden , etc ) ; ** 4 ) ** illegal for both the customer and the prostitute ( belarus ) . 
  there 's also some countries in which it 's a big ambiguous , such as spain . 
  i think there 's also one or two countries which punish the prostitute , but not the customer : / i think the situation in latin america is almost as equally varied , with a shift towards the harsher punishments like in belarus , but on the other hand it 's arguably more prevalent because the authorities turn a blind eye to it ( which is n't the case in most of europe ) . 
  mod here this has been delisted under rule 2.6 . 
  we do n't have nature shots or city scapes here . 
  try / r/europics,
