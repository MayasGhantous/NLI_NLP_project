  i thought it was the weirdest thing but i was too embarrassed to comment ( they did n't seem like the sought that liked their lives being questioned ) . 
  is this normal ? 
  mod here this has been delisted under rule 2.6, 
  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search.html there should be about 6 different meps who represent your constituency . 
  your constituency will likely be very large , containing a few million people , and perhaps about a hundred miles wide . 
  the mets will likely all be members of different parties . 
  send an email or letter or phone call to all of them , because no matter what party it is , they all represent you equally, 
  it 's like telling an ardent mac or pc fanboy/fangirl that there 's positives and negatives to both formats ( and then there 's linux that i 'm not even gon na comment on because : irrelevant ) . 
  i 'd love of this sub suddenly became super pro-ttip and you then had to start telling everybody to not be pro-ttip because the texts * still * have n't been released and it 's just misinformation in the other direction . 
  neutrality is the only acceptable position !, 
  source please . 
  removed for spamming, 
  i just wan na say , look how thick that door is when the drivers get out . 
  i know that george osborne has been known to use first class train tickets for inter uk travel rather than using a plane , although a plane would ordinarily be quicker . 
  personally this would make me guess that davcam9000 just uses an ordinary first class plane ticket . 
  that guy 's also the son of the former leader of the labour party !, 
  it 's a shame how many political dynasties we 're getting in the uk : / boris has a brother in parliament . 
  tony ben has a son or grandson in parliament . 
  one of winston churchill 's children . 
  ed and david miliband are both high level politicians and sons of a social democratic intellectual . 
  i think there 's a few more too . 
  i 've always known that there are alternative scottish papers , but now that i think of it , i want to ask if they 've always been like that or if it only changed after the scottish parliament was created in 1998 ? 
  i 've seen other people use the term gip , and i think it 's also usually quite easy to guess what gip means if i use the sentence `` gip countries have quite a lot of debt '' and you 've heard the term pig countries . 
  also , i 've never heard gip as a synonym for semen . 
  it 's a term that developed at the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis to refer to the `` problem countries '' of europe who had/have difficulty paying off their debts . 
  giips stands for ** g ** reece , ** i ** reland , ** i ** taly , ** p ** ortugal and ** s ** pain ( but sometimes more or less letters are added to include the great britain and iceland ) . 
  normally it 's spelled as [ piigs ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/piigs ) but i like to spell it back to front because calling these countries `` pigs '' sounds quite insulting imho . 
  yeah , it 's easy to forget that people do read newspapers critically and are n't * that * swayed by the way the journalists phrase things . 
  those 1 % s of people voting green who read the telegraph , the mail , the express and the sun ... 
  surely that must be a rounding error ?

  i see , merci, 
   it 's hard to think of another world leader who came from that type of background . 
  well , there was the uk prime minister from 1990-7 , john major , who was [ raised by a circus performer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom_major-ball ) and was unemployed for a period in his youth . 
  the father was a successful performer , but then obama 's father also did an m.a. 
  at harvard , so it 's not exactly like he was a true embodiment of middle classdom either . 
  still , both very unusual and modest up bringings for future world leaders and it 's nice that their backgrounds are becoming increasingly modest . 
  i ca n't think of any offices which have been held by the same person in * two different counties * at the same time , but i can tell you that boris johnson is currently mayor of london ( a full-time political job ) * and * is a member of cabinet ( the committee of mps which runs the country ) . 
  so that 's two offices held by the same person at the same time . 
  here 's a [ list of meps who represent constituents in countries that they do not hold the citizenship of ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_of_the_european_parliament#election_of_non-nationals ) . 
  interestingly there 's three non british europeans who represent the uk , and one of them is a spaniard representing * ukip !, 
  * additionally [ the european parliament does not allow meps to be members of their national legislatures simultaneously ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dual_mandate#european_parliament ) . 
  an organisation worth looking into for simultaneous office holding in multiple countries , is probably the irish political party sinn fein , which campaigns for a united ireland and therefore contests seats in both northern ireland ( part of the uk ) and the republic of ireland . 
  i believe the party 's deputy leader is a member of the stormont parliament in ni , whilst the party leader is a member of the dais in the roi . 
  out of curiosity , what do n't you like about him ? 
  from what i 've seen he seems like a very middle of the road social democrat who got pushed to the right ( into supporting austerity ) by political circumstances . 
  warning : / u/madkillller is a quebecois , or * french canadian * . 
  treat with suspicion . 
  this might actually be a winner . 
  a normal source of hate is from their larger neighbour , ** but ** britons do n't feel any anger towards the republic of ireland because we ca n't of feel responsible . 
  although the unionists in northern ireland might be a cause of trouble . 
  ireland 's also a considered one of the gip countries ( the `` i '' is used for ireland and iceland depending no the prevailing economic weather , or sometimes there 's two `` i '' 's ) but they 've been one of the most strict with the austerity programme and it has been generally successful , which makes the creditor nations ( who are normally angry with the gips ) quite happy . 
  additionally , catholic countries like ireland for being catholic but liberal countries like ireland because they 're not so catholic that they wo n't allow equal marriage . 
  *** neeeeext ***, 
  also , they 're a tax heaven . 
  also , they produce more false teeth than anybody in the world . 
  * the more you know ... *, 
  if one of our prime ministers turned up in something as ostentatious as * that thing * to an international summit , such as the g7 , i 'd consider it a national embarrassment . 
  we do n't need a prime minister who jet sets around the world and up stages other heads of state in flashy sports cars . 
  we 've got enough to be proud of without being a show off . 
  so if you said * `` je t ` aime '' * ( i like/love you ) then i might respond with * `` tu m ` as touch\u00e9 '' * ( you have touched me ) or * `` je suis touch\u00e9 !, 
  '' * ( i am [ being ] touched ! ) ? 
  the english translations of this make it sound super creepy ... 
  barack obama jr. ( the one who 's current us president ) was born in hawai'i , on the main island of honolulu . 
  his mother was of english ancestry whilst his father had been born in kenyan . 
  his parents met whilst studying at the university of hawai'i . 
  barack obama jr. also later went on to become senator ( i.e. 
  member of parliament of the more powerful chamber ) of illinois for a brief period before becoming president . 
  source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barack_obama#early_life_and_career and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barack_obama,_sr . 
  -- ** here 's some extra information about political figures , elections and citizenship that i thought might be interesting ** . 
  the reason this is an issue is because an american citizen can not become the president unless they were a us citizen * from birth * . 
  this means that arnold schwarzenegger ( former governor of california ) can not become president because he only got citizenship through naturalisation , but was not born with it . 
  otoh someone like london mayor boris johnson * could * become us president because they are a dual national by virtue of having been accidentally born in the usa whilst his parents were on holiday there ( and boris johnson is currently seen as one of the potential successors to david cameron as uk prime minister ) . 
  interestingly this led to the election in 2008 where * both candidates * were accused of not being able to hold office , as some people ( wrongly ) assumed that obama had only been given kenyan citizenship at birth , and people assumed that obama 's challenger ( john mccain ) did n't either because he was born outside of the united states ( although he was born to us presidents which meant he * was * a natural born us citizen and therefore eligible to become president ) . 
  ** iirc ** obama had to ( at some point ) choose between kenyan and us citizenship because kenya no longer allowed dual nationals . 
  however , the law has since been changed allowing individuals who formerly lost their citizenship to regain it . 
  so in theory obama could regain his kenyan citizenship and then choose to stand in british elections or elections anywhere in the commonwealth  source : http://kenyaembassy.com/dualcitizenship.html, 
  would n't you use the verb * toucher * ( of which the simple past tense is * touch\u00e9 * ) in the sense of `` to touch '' or `` to hit '' ? 
  like * `` tu m ` as touch\u00e9 '' * ( you have touched me ) ? 
  iirc the english use of the word derived from fencing ( a sword game ) where when the opponent strikes you , you say `` touch '' and then the person gets a point . 
  it get adopted into the wider english vocabulary because people starting using this bit of fencing terminology for arguments because people see arguments as a form of intellectual sword play , where you try and score points ( or touches ) on the ` opponent ' . 
  when you do the food one , can you include some links to recipes or a site where i can find recipes ? 
  in france , all are treated equally before the power of the cheek kiss ( well ... apart from in some regions where it depends if you 're a big or a girl ) !, 
  but in england , we discriminate differently . 
  also , now they i think about it , i 've been to some weird ` social function ' typed things where i guess the host / hostess greeted one guest with a cheek kiss then they just start greeting everyone that way under the pretense that they 're refined and classy ( because everybody knows class = european/french , even if we wo n't admit it ), 
  that 's the second time i 've seen this ` petit journal ' thing . 
  is it like a french version of the heute show ( which itself is a german version of the daily show ) ? 
  why do n't you europeans learn from the british instead of the americans and make panel shows like hignfy instead of these pseudo stand up shows !, 
  ( although i did think it was quite funny ) . 
  what was the joke about jean-claude juncker ? 
  i think there 's some context there i did n't get, 
  is it though ? 
  i know you would n't do it to strangers and you would n't do it to friends but my parents and grandparents ( on one side ) used to do it by way of a farewell and i 've seen relatives of another family i 'm friends with do it between themselves too . 
  i always just kind of assumed it was n't that uncommon in the uk, 
  i think expats certainly should have some influence of the politics back home . 
  i mean , if you want the government to care about a particular group then they need the right to vote because they gives them power over the government . 
  but if you take away people 's right to vote when they move abroad ... who looks after them then ? 
  they ca n't vote in the country they 're in because they 're not a citizen and they ca n't vote in their home country because that rights been taken away .
