  okiedoke ; checks out . 
  relisting . 
  could you link me to the relevant wiki pages so i can check if they are sourced . 
  delisted until a source is provided . 
  we 're anti-eu in the sense that we want less of the eu . 
  the uk opted out of a bunch of eu crime measures , opted out of the euro , opted out of the common asylum policy , opted out of the no boarders ( schengen ) zone , and now david cameron is going to europe and pushing for withdrawal of the social chapter to limit the eu to simply a trading area . 
   two thirds of british muslims polled said they think that insulting islam should be an arrestable offence . 
  that may not be an active call for violence , ... 
  yes , that is quite a popular belief amongst muslims , but not only is it ` not an active call for violence ' it 's not anywhere near . 
  muslims are ( generally ) not liberals . 
  but they 're also ( generally ) not fascists or comparable to fascists either . 
  they have regressive and paternalistic social attitudes which i personally find regressive and deplorable . 
  but they 're not violent either . 
   this is n't evidence , it 's public relations . 
  so what can we believe , if not what they tell us ? 
  your survey is an example of muslims telling us what they believe just like this declaration by the mcb . 
  am i to not believe your survey simply because muslims could all collectively be lying ? 
   from a moderate muslim perspective the british armed forces is no better than fucking isis ? 
  uh ... no . 
  let me explain using an example . 
  from a moderate , pacifist muslim perspective , isis is like a serial killer , whilst the british armed forces are like a murderer ( and possibly even a crime of passion murderer rather than premeditated murder ) . 
  obviously , both are bad , and nobody should become either of these things , even though one is quite clearly worse than the other . 
   annoying idiots who justify the more increasingly obnoxious attitudes i do n't justify the actions of the muslim community . 
  i think islam is wrong on many counts and i find it 's social attitudes completely repulsive . 
  ** however ** i also think that most muslims do not support isis . 
  i believe in freedom of religion , you know , one of our human rights laid down in the european convention . 
  but i see people very often arguing that all muslims should be deported because all muslims are isis supported , terrorists or whatever . 
  that 's simply not true which is why i make comments that demonstrate that , actually , whilst a lot of muslims social practices are regressive and wrong , they 're not * that * wrong . 
  i respect muslims as people and i respect their right to have beliefs , even if i think those beliefs are wrong . 
  i also think that we should criticise their religion on its own merits and not based on some strange terrorist organisations which they do n't support and do n't agree with . 
  so i would ask you that you actually * engage * with the material you 're down voting and understand what i , and others , are trying to say . 
  i do not support the muslim community , but i do support their right to be a community and to have beliefs , even when they chive with my own . 
  i 'm not george galloway . 
  please respect the differences and stop seeing things as black and white . 
  i 'd be skeptical of how many of those there actively are though . 
  it 's something that can be neither proved nor disproved . 
  the only piece of evidence i have either way is that the muslim council of britain , which claims to represent all or an overwhelming majority of british mosques , has publicly rejected and condemned the actions and beliefs of isis . 
  i 'd say there definitely * can * be muslims who silently support isis , but i 'd say that they are likely massively out numbered by muslims who silently or publicly deplore isis . 
  edit : in response to all the down votes i am getting , i would refer people to the [ reddiquette ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) `` vote . 
  if you think something contributes to conversation , upvote it . 
  if you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community , downvote it . '', 
  if you think then i am doing that then fine , but just please keep it in mind . 
  out of interest , why did you vote akp ? 
  you seem to be somewhat of a minority on the english speaking internet . 
  would be interested to hear first hand reasons why, 
  shhhh they 're trying . 
  let them think they 're doing a good job, 
  optimum sadness levels : achieved next process : unclear . 
  initiating hibernate mode and awaiting further instruction -- ( p.s. 
  i appreciate it  it 's not often i get thanked , or even up voted for saying anything that could vaguely be construed as nice about muslims ), 
  i 'll justify whatever i believe is correct , and you ca n't stop me !, 
  * jumps through an open car window and escapes into the distance *, 
  hmm , i think it does make it slightly less depressing . 
  the way the title is phrased makes it appear that muslims support isis and islamic fundamentalism more than they support the uk , but that 's not the case . 
  the nyt 's title seems to imply that membership of the armed forces is a proxy for support of the nation state , but it 's not . 
  so what i was trying to point out was that although a few hundred british muslims have joined is whilst hardly any have joined the uk armed services , that 's actually for all sorts of third factors . 
  muslims generally do support the uk and reject isis , even if their opinions on both are very complicated . 
  obviously i 'm deeply saddened that any british muslims , or anybody at all for that matter , would support and fight on behalf of isis . 
  that 's tragic , and what they do and stand for is tragic . 
  but that does n't mean that does n't mean that isis is at all popular in the uk amongst any section of society , and the nyt 's title gives a completely different impression . 
  so , it 's sad , but not as sad is it would appear at first glance , is what i 'm trying to say !, 
  i think it has a lot to do with a mixture of socio-economic circumstances with a few cultural elements . 
  islamic immigrants tend to ( perhaps contrary to popular belief ) be better educated and therefore obtain better jobs than the average uk citizen . 
  by contrast , the army largely recruits from low socio-economic backgrounds , which muslims are not very well represented in but some other immigrant groups are . 
  i mean , the other groups you 've mentioned come from * geographic * areas where as muslims do n't come from just one place . 
  for instance , indian immigrants to the uk will often have varying degrees of education before they arrive , but muslims may well be better represented amongst the top levels of indian emigrants . 
  additionally , many moderate muslims who are progressive enough to emigrate to a western society ( although often still very conservative by our standards ) do have commitments to pacifism . 
  this often gets forgotten with all the isis and al-qaueda stuff , but that 's because those groups are * islamic fundamentalists * , not ordinary muslims . 
  it 's a radical new form which has taken hold in recent time . 
  [ christian fundamentalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_fundamentalism#christian_right ) has many similar qualities ( although the two are obviously not the same ) . 
  the westborro baptist church iirc is an example of christian fundamentalism . 
  however , * most * christians imho are * good people * who are against gratuitous violence . 
  it 's the same for most non fundamentalist muslims . 
  tbf , it 's quite understandable . 
  muslims tend to either be either largely pacifist , or they favour military action on behalf of islam . 
  so if you 're the kind of muslim who does n't support isil ( which is most of them ) then you 're also not going to support the british armed forces , because , from a moderate muslim perspective , they 're both pretty bad . 
  even if you take the muslim dimension out of it , support for the armed forces is seriously waning . 
  from what i understand donations for charities like help the heros is dropping , and if you look at uk 's recent military history in iraq and afghanistan and the awful reputation those wars have , it 's not too hard to imagine why . 
  now , if you imagine that you are an immigrant ( muslims are predominantly immigrants , or recent decedents of immigrants ) from * anywhere * then you are likely to very much fall into the anti armed forces camp , especially seeing as you might be asked to attack one of your relatives in the not so distant future . 
  really , the only social group in the uk which actually has consistent support for the british armed forces , and the social class which makes up 90 % of new recruits , is the british white working class . 
  british white middle , and upper classes , as well as most immigrants are waning in their support for the armed forces , and because they usually have a much better educational background ( immigrants and muslims generally outperform their white working class peers ) they are not forced to inquire into a career in the armed forces . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : the reasons muslims do n't know the armed services are a lot to do with moderate muslim pacifism and demography than to do with any sort of wide spread islamic fundamentalism amongst uk muslims . 
  exit polls are normally done by polling companies on behalf of media organisations . 
  their value is entirely derived from them being accurate , so the organisations have an incentive to not tamper with the results , where as vote counters can sometimes be a bit more influenceable . 
  but even if there was a disparity , it would n't be enough to prove or even suggest voter fraud . 
  in the 1992 election in the uk the exit polls predicted a clear labour victory but it ended up being another five years of the conservative john major . 
  it was because exit polls are conducted by pollsters standing outside the voting booths and asking people how they voted , but lots of people were embarrassed to say they voted conservative , so just said they voted labour ( even though they did n't ) . 
  it 's for reasons like this that exit polls are n't as reliable as the actual election results themselves . 
  if the exit polls and the election result are the same , then it 's likely there was only minimal fraud . 
  if the election results and the exit polls are * not * the same , than it does n't prove or even suggest that there was fraud . 
  if they 're getting to the point where they 're mutilating their fingers to get in , it 's probably a real asylum case, 
  apart from the threshold thing , is the election system broadly proportional ? 
  do you use a party list or is it fptp ? 
  is there just one chamber of parliament or two ? 
  to those downvoting u/alceus i 'd just like to say that reading some of the criticisms of the party ( especially the ones which are getting an unusually positive showing here like chp ) is useful and interesting, 
  what are the areas where chp has become more conservative ? 
  and from what i understand akp is an islamic party ( ?? ), 
  which * could be considered * a form of neoconservativism , because it 's about supporting traditional values ( and going back to those traditional values ) . 
  over here there has been a historic link between conservative parties and religion ( the church of england use to be called the conservative party at prayer , and the german conservatives are called the christian democrats ) but from what other understand akp just takes it * way * further until they 're quite similar to things like jobbik ( in hungary ) or golden dawn ( in greece ) . 
  that 's my ignorant outsider 's perspective,
