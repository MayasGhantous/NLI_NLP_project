  tbf : pkk does have support from hdp , and pkk * has * undertaken terrorists acts . 
  you could say those acts were justified , but the only other thing you could realistically call them is freedom fighters which is equally vague, 
  how would you say chp compared to mainland european liberal parties ( like the liberal democrats , freie demokraten , alde ) ? 
  obviously seems to be one with their focus on free speech , but it 's surprising to see a liberalish party in turkey , given the somewhat authoritarian state it 's in now, 
  ooo now i wan na go to brussels just to see this fancy hot drinks xray . 
   the former requires upgrades of the welsh lines , which is n't going to happen . 
  tbf , if we 're in a situation where we 're so over flowing with money that we 're going to build a tunnel * under the sea * then we 'd probably also be able to afford to upgrade the trains in wales too . 
  it 'd be a good idea to do so anyway , because the technology has really advanced . 
  i think they recently electrified some of the cardiff-london line too . 
   the channel tunnel works because it is linking london with paris and brussels . 
  even that does n't work very well . 
  iirc eurostar was failing to make a profit for years , and had to be bailed out by the french and british governments ( or something like that ) . 
  a link between cardiff/birmingham/london / bristol and dublin/cork would be a disaster if even connecting major areas of the blue banana are n't financially profitable . 
  there 'd need to be some huge advancements in tunnel boring technology . 
  holy shit , talinn is like the worst connected capital city ever, 
  how did i do that .

  [ england riots of 2011 ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/unruhen_in_england_2011 ), 
  i would n't be * that * surprised if someone called it `` the english isles '' or something stupid , because the whole situation is misunderstood to such a huge extent . 
  i 'd still furiously correct the person , though . 
  one battle at a time . 
  it has a lot to do with the fact that divorce laws in sweden are a lot more relaxed than in other ( especially eastern european ) countries , and that the provision of welfare and parental leave which is available ( iirc swedish parents get a year of paid leave to share between them ) makes it much more viable for women to raise children alone , where as in other countries it 's almost impossible . 
  for instance , in the uk although divorce law is relatively straight forward , you only get a few weeks maternity leave off , and the costs of childcare make it virtually impossible to work whilst leaving your kid at home , which requires that you go on welfare ( which will give you a measly and pathetic standard of living ) or , you just find a partner who 'll support you economically even if you do n't like them that much . 
  [ are you forgetting the great gnome crisis of 2014 ? 
  ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/26/400-gnomes-disappeared-in-austria-and-its-causing-a-political-scandal/ ), 
   does n't that lead to bad english style ? 
  it definitely * can * lead to bad style in whichever language you 're translating into , but that 's where the real skill of translation comes into it . 
  you 've got to not only have a vast vocabulary ( of words * and idioms * ) and knowledge of grammar in both languages ( or however many languages ) but you also have to know how they correspond . 
  for instance i know the phrase `` he was becoming larger and larger '' in english and i know the phrase `` er wurde immer gr\u00f6\u00dfere '' ( he was becoming always bigger ) but as a translator one also needs to know that these phrases , despite being literally different if you translate them directly , are actually have completely the same meaning . 
  so you can start to see that translation is actually an entirely distinct skill from simple multilingualism . 
  additionally , with sentence structure specifically , as a translator you need to develop a sense for when german clauses should be ended and replaced with a full stop when translating into english . 
  it 's difficult because you need to be very engaged with the flow of both pieces of writing and really thinking in both languages , rather than simply being a google translate bot . 
  personally i never change a german comma into an english full stop because i tend to write very long english sentences anyway ( as you can probably tell ) . 
  although to a certain degree i think getting a truly accurate english translation of german which is also flows nicely is * sometimes * impossible because of that way in which german tends to go on and on . 
  i think english writers like to add in a nice short perfunctory sentence at a semi regular intervals , to condense the ideas ( or at least they do if they are a good writer ) , but germans do n't seem to in the same way . 
  you ca n't then add it into the translation without changing the original intent of the author . 
  but fortunately this is * almost never * the case , and even then , only effects certain kinds of things ( such as translations of novels ) rather than most areas of writing ( such as academic texts or even films ) . 
  just some thoughts on translation !, 
  nb : this whole passage was written in english first , unlike all of the other pieces of writing so far , which have been english translated from pigeon german . 
  * out of interest , are you writing in german are norwegian ? 
  i can hardly understand the beginning but the second half is exactly like german *, 
  hey !, 
  you forgot that other european country which borders the middle east !, 
  ^ ( cyprus ), 
   there is a reason why reddit is one of the top read websites world wide . 
  because of our content . 
  reddit is not avery nice looking site . 
  it 's not * bad * but it 's not good either . 
  i think the designs we 're working on atm are actually pleasing to the eye , as well as increasing usability . 
  for largely literature based subreddits , they do n't really have any benefit . 
  i mean , 80 % of our content is news and editorials and the thumbnails which go on those usually add nothing to the article . 
  but they often wo n't even add nothing , they 'll actually grab an inappropriate picture , such as from an advert on the site . 
  additionally , seeing as though have no benefit ( imho ) they * really * mess with the colour scheme of the subreddit and can make it look quite ugly , especially when we have such a nice colour scheme already . 
  just my 2:00 am thoughts . 
  * instead of that , we could learn foreign languages and write in these languages , exactly like the other users who write in english everyday . 
  hi , sorry but this has been delisted under rule 2.6 . 
  ty relisted . 
  not really . 
  when we think of `` discrimination '' we tend to think of unjustified discrimination ( because it 's come to be a bad word ) but essentially it just means that you 're treating things differently . 
  for instance , when i decide what clothes to put on on a cold day , i use the thickness of the fabricate to discriminate between the various items . 
  likewise , when you are interviewing candidates for a job position , you discriminate ( hopefully ) based on who is best for the job . 
  however , you can also discriminate using bad criteria , such as race . 
  this is the sort of discrimination which is to be avoided and the reason why discrimination has become negative word . 
  please provide a source . 
  will re-list as soon as credibly source is provided, 
  hmm ... would the special flair not appear in the flair selection box for ordinary members members , then ? 
  it would only appear to mods as an option ? 
  i 've always wished that we had novelty flairs that we could hand out to disguised users . 
  nothing big , just like , small golden outline to their flair or something . 
  we could give it to people who do a lot of news round up comments or who help us with stuff like web design , or anything we come up with in the future . 
  people * love * novelty things, 
  this is n't to do with europe . 
  delisted under rule 2.6 . 
  hmm , i think that 's quite a good selection actually . 
  i 'd be tempted to make a couple of changes . 
  personally i really like the opinion-news split , but i 'll have to take that back to the drawing board to establish if it 's feasible . 
  the only other thing i 'd change about the list is potential add a different thing for maps or images , as opposed to data . 
  some maps are just funny , more than they are data , and it would be strange to put them in the same category as a eurobaramoter survey or a report on the labour market . 
  we 'll have to think about what sort of a selection we want , is the just if what i 'm trying to say here . 
  god damnit !, 
  why are all the other subreddits so much fancier ? 
  look / r/france / r/italy / r/de / r/sweden / r/scotland / r/russia / r/greece the uk subreddit ( / r/unitedkingdom / ) looks bad in comparison to these * but it 's still better made * . 
  the main thing we 've got going for us is that our colour scheme is amazing . 
  / r/europe is not content with simply linking to entertainment , we 're creating entertainment now too !, 
   the flair themselves do n't mean anything to me . 
  `` opinion '' , `` news '' are very vague words that do n't help at all and are open to interpretation . 
  do you think it would be better if ( regarding the two examples you gave specifically ) we used ` editorials ' and ` reporting ' instead ? 
  that 's their proper names , but i 'm not sure if they 'd be more or less helpful, 
  there 's a reason a reason we did this at midnight for most of / r/europe, 
   i wish he would stop with his whacky and unnecessary ideas . 
  but he 's * french * whacky and unnecessary is in his genes * and that 's fantastique * ** and ** * fabulous *, 
  two things one is that , again , users will be able to give you insight into what the link is before you click it ( for instance , by telling you if it 's an editorial/opinion piece or a news report ) two : if you want to avoid the news , or only look at the news , or only look at discussion posts/avoid discussion posts then we 'll be adding a thing to the sidebar so you can click and then do just that . 
  you can do that currently by clicking the green `` avoid stories about nato/russia/ukraine '' which works on the exact same principle . 
   there 's not a single custom css that does n't suck in all of reddit . 
  the thing is , for people like you who believe that , there is a very simple solution ( turn off the subreddit styles ) where as for a lot of us people who * do * like subreddit styles , we can participate in a discussion about improving the css , because that 's the sort of thing we like . 
  just whilst i remember , how do people feel about thumbnails ? 
  should we have them , should n't we ? 
  it looks * so much * better now that they 're of equal size, 
  especially the links, 
   more to the point , what do these topic flairs add that one would n't already know from the headlines ?
