  i 'm ok if they use it for those ends , but not if they * turn it into a place * for non europeans to ask europeans questions , or for discussions * between * americans and europeans . 
  i think this causes a lot of our users to get very defensive * very * quickly . 
  we 've got something good here ( even if it 's not perfect ) and we 're eager to preserve the bits which are good . 
  and remember , join the sozialdemokratische partei deutschlands !, 
  oh my god i 've never laughed so hard at a reddit comment, 
   fallout 4 i refuse to believe that 's real . 
  i 've been hurt too much already . 
  i 'm not even gon na think about hoping until i know it 's true . 
  the reason we spaced the moderation invites out over a period of days was so that the mods could settle in . 
  it 's not surprising that maybe / u/norrisobe made a few mistakes * on their first day * . 
  they have n't had time to get into the roll . 
  they 're a good user who has a long posting history in this sub and usually of high quality . 
  i have every confidence they 'll quickly learn the ropes and become a good mod . 
  sorry but this has been delisted because it is not do to with the theme of this sub . 
  try / r/education, 
  we 've just re-invited them . 
  they 'll likely accept the invitations over the course of the night and tomorrow . 
  the new mods which were added were / u/dclauzel , / u/ivashkin , / u/saltysolomon , / u/norrisobe and / u/crnaruka . 
  they were all removed temporarily whilst we examined the leaks . 
  we feel as though we 've established where the leak was ( faulty passwords ) so that particular crisis is solved and we 're adding the mods back . 
  edit : just gon na point out that all down voting does is hide this post from visibility . 
  fifty shades of grey is fourth for spain . 
  * nice *, 
  mod here removed rules 2.5 and 2.6 . low quality content . 
  i can sympathise with that , but i would advice that you post it anyway . 
  normal subreddit etiquette indicates that you should provide a translation in the comments . 
  also , you can put the title in english so long as it is a direct translation . 
  because you 're just using the self post as a vehicle to post your submission . 
  all this is is an ordinary submission disguised as a self post . 
  if you want to discuss this article , submit it per the normal procedure and discuss it * in the comments section * without editorialising the headline . 
  i 'd say it 's just more representative of the actual political opinions in the uk i.e. 
  that a broad majority of the sub supports ukip/conservatives . 
  there 's a lot of labourites ( ~ social democrats ~ ) and lib dems ( liberals ) and even the odd green , which is how it actually is in real life . 
  subs like / r/ukpolitics has gotten a fair amount more right wing in recent years , but that 's also because the uk got a lot more right wing in recent years . 
  this has been delisted for editorialising . 
  please use a direct translation of the original headline . 
  is socrates the guy on the left or the guy in the right ? 
  it 's pretty hard to fin examples of her speaking french though . 
  i mean , she 's a non political figure who seldom makes any public statements of her own accord at all ( except for maybe once or twice a year for christmas speech and maybe for her birthday ) . 
  there 's hardly any occasions where she would speak a foreign language publicly . 
  the only times would be when she meets french speaking people , which is basically only when there 's an official function with the head of state of a french speaking country , which is actually really rare . 
  and even then there will only be a brief sound bite like this, 
  do n't trust it if she has paper on front of her when she 's speaking . 
  on her first stage visit to ireland part of her speech was in fluent irish , but she 'd just learnt it before hand and memorised . 
  the queen does speak fluent french though . 
  how come sarkozy was able to rebrand the whole party ? 
  i thought he was n't even leader yet . 
  seems like a * huge * change to make on a whim . 
  has there been any criticism of this from within the right or from within the ump/republicans more specifically ? 
  also , do you have a link ( in french or english ) for the tax story ? 
  that sounds interesting !, 
  i want to know if it 's effective/could be copied elsewhere . 
  speak for yourself !,

  this has been delisted because there 's already a near identical submission on the / r/europe front page already, 
  even if their owned by the same people , they 'll still likely compete because there 's so many regulations which state that governments have got to be equal between different operators . 
  do n't rule it out . 
  i 'm also pretty multi-culti too . 
  i 'm less than half british by ancestry ( mixture of english , irish , polish and germanic jewish ) and currently in the process of obtaining german citizenship . 
   public moderation log we 've already got one . 
  he was high !, 
  that 's completely different and 100 % okay . 
  everybody knows osborne likes a little bit of the old hokey cokey, 
  how could this pass me by !, 
  one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . 
  one man 's annoying is another man 's amusing .

  i 'd be surprised if you did know much about it :p you just wrote an application , the rest of us actually had to read through * all of them * , _ , and then look up on any other details * and then * discuss it with the other moderators . 
  much . 
  time . 
  edit : i retract my earlier statement . 
  correct . 
  as far as we 're concerned , the domestic affairs of russia are as relevant to this subreddit as the domestic affairs of france . 
  all news about russia is absolutely fine and we actually encourage it . 
  so the fact we killed thousands , if not tens of thousands , in each of these african nations had no long term impact ? 
  much less , the fact that we stole as much of their ancient artefacts and natural resources as was possible . 
  also completely ignoring the fact that we left them in artificially formed countries which were almost impossible to given because of the way we drew the lines with absolutely no reference to cultural borders ... 
  non of these things , in your opinion , have * any * long term impact ? 
   also , i do n't think my country is in any way to blame for any of thi http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abyssinia_crisis http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_italo-ethiopian_war http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_italo-ethiopian_war http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_somaliland http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_libya#conquest, 
   so that in the end even we ca n't live in our own country . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  you think that all of these african and asian refugees are secretly part of some elaborate plot to overthrow european countries ? 
  what are you getting at here ? 
   the numbers of refugees will magically drop no they wo n't the mediterranean crossing is n't same cake walk . 
  a couple of months ago over 1,000 people died trying to cross the med * in a single week * . 
  that journey is hugely dangerous . 
  these people are willing to risk everything for a * tiny * chance . 
  making that change ever smaller is n't going to detour them . 
   the migrants will think twice if it 's worth the risk . 
  these refugees already think about it pretty hard , i can assure you . 
  it 's not like they just randomly decide to mozy on over to the med and get into a little peddle boat . 
  most of these people have had to sell all of their worldly possessions , like their house and their belongings , in order to finance the trip and they will likely be somewhat aware of the risks . 
  furthermore , they then have to travel through the sahara desert , which is likely to kill them , before they even get to the med , which is even more likely to kill them . 
  making the journey marginally more shitty than it already is , is going to do nothing . 
  i already discuss in another comment how these people are coming mainly from war zones and autocratic states with systematised persecution , and not from middling african countries where things are comparatively average by african standards . 
  refugees come because * they ca n't live in their own country * . 
  they do n't come here because it 'll be nice . 
  this has been delisted because there 's already an identical submission on the front page .
