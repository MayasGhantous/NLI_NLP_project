  i care about the people in my country , not the country itself . 
  if my country is going to become smaller , and get a smaller economy , but the quality of life of the people in that country is going to go * up * or be higher than it would be otherwise , then i am in favour of a declining population . 
  we ca n't afford to have an infinitely growing population . 
  earth 's resources will run out , but before they do , our consumption 's side effects will cause the death of our planet . 
  i 'd rather avoid that by avoiding too many births . 
  it 's because i care about my country that i want a low birth rate . 
  this submission has been delisted because there already a near identical submission on the front page posted an hour earlier, 
  it will not give hope to millions of africans . 
  that statement is just not borne out by the facts . 
  asylum applications in europe mostly come syria and eritrea , two of the most dangerous regions on the planet right now . 
  the reason asylum applications have gone up in recent years is because the situation in these countries has deteriorated , not because europe started accepting more refugees . 
  if europe 's taking in of refugees actually caused more refugees to set off , then we would see large rises in countries like egypt , the sudan and morocco , which we are n't . 
  numbers in those countries are still in the low thousands , as you would expect for a country like that . 
  so no . 
  all we have done is saved the lives of 4,200 people who would otherwise die in the mediterranean . 
  we have not increased the flow of asylum seekers to europe . 
  furthermore , the uk absolutely should participate in the refugee sharing programme . 
  if we let refugees concentrate in some countries and not others , then we 're helping create the ghettos that people like you are so scared of . 
  good . 
  another 4,200 lives saved that can go onto refugee processing camps where we will determine if they should be allowed to stay or sent home . 
  i 'm not exactly sure that would stand up in a court of law . 
  i , also as someone who 's see their fair share , do n't think he is necessarily drunk at all . 
  he is n't shit faced . 
  i 've yet to find any evidence that he has been significantly intoxicated during his time in office so far . 
  as far as i can see the title is unsubstantiated, 
  do you mean `` marriage of convenience '' ? 
  these two germans are translating the sentences * super literally * ( not even changing the glorious german word order ) . 
  / u/jozef7 means `` if it tastes [ good ] then taste it '' / u/eigenwert 's is an idiom which means `` with that translation you 've got another thing coming . '', 
  or , less literally `` with that translation you 're on shaky ground though '' or '' ... on the wrong track '' . 
  ensuring that an imagine is legitimate , and that users who want to follow up on the story can do so , is not contributing to the discussion ? 
  seems almost essential to me . 
  yeah , but cameron is an especially progressive conservative . 
  he 's far more progressive than the rest of his party * and * he was in coalition with the liberal democrats , a party who 've supported same sex marriage since god knows when ( and who forced the conservatives to do a lot of other nice things that they get no credit for ) . 
  merkel , on the other hand , is a traditional christian conservative . 
  her ideology is largely in the same place it was decades ago ( where as conservatism in the uk has been changing wildly since the 80s ) with extremely traditional attitudes towards the family . 
  obviously she puts pragmatism before all else ( as most conservatives do ) , but unless there is a big * electoral * reason for her to support gay marriage ( such as it suddenly becoming incredibly popular with her electorate ) then there is no reason for her to do it . 
  maybe we should try and transport our oceans off into the solar system in order to expand the size of germany , and other coastal countries . 
  should n't be too difficult if we put our minds too it . 
  please provide source . 
  depends if you see a low birthrate as a good thing or a bad thing . 
  there was an interesting documentary on the bbc about a couple of brits who went to live and work in germany for a few weeks . 
  one of the things they found interesting is that when germans work , they work , but when working hours are over , that 's it . 
  the work does n't come home with them and they do proper full on leisure activities . 
  this is contrasted with the uk , where we tend to work normal hours in quite a relaxed why , but we 're also usually expected to be contactable at all hours , and in many professions people work during their lunch breaks . 
  so basically , the germans are very binary ( they 're either working or they 're not working . 
  no middle ground ) where as in the uk it 's more of a spectrum ( sometimes you 're working hard , sometimes sort of working but actually just chatting , and sometimes you 're off the clock but still working . 
  it 's all a bit grey ) . 
   well , i mean , you do n't speak ours ... doch !, 
  i know you 're joking , but you misspelled f\u00fchrer , and also f\u00fchrerland is n't really a word ( in the sense that nobody uses it , which means it 's about as much of a word as all the other words people like to post from the german language which are just so cooky and unique ) . 
  then why is it that despite the fact i 've only been to sweden once all of the most attractive people on my facebook page are swedish ? 
  ** checkmate **, 
   there are as many stunning women in london , paris , ny or milan as there are in moscow . 
  * too bad all the stunning women in london actually come from paris , new york , milan and moscow !, 
  * did i do it right ? 
  it 's a lot like the uk ! = england thing , but personally i quite often use them ** seemingly ** interchangeably . 
  the thing is , i say england or the uk when i * mean * england or the uk ( or great britain ) . 
  to people who do n't know the differences very well , it looks like i am just using the terms interchangeably but i 'm not . 
  it 's just that when i talk about cultural mannerism and things i tend to talk about england , because i feel as though scottish , welsh and northern irish culture is a bit different , so i only talk about england with certainty . 
  but if i am talking about it legally or politically , i 'll talk about the uk ( although that 's becoming increasingly difficult as well ) . 
  i think it 's the same with the hollandish people . 
  they 'll sometimes talk about their country in one sense , and use a polito-geographic term which is most appropriate . 
  irish tricolour * and * the union jack ? 
  also , given the sas flag and their very mirky history in northern ireland ( they 've been accused of executing irish dissidents ) i 'm gon na assume that you just like flags , rather than their political implications . 
  it is interesting though , that we stick with the europeans against the americans and not the other way around . 
  a lot of brits seriously believe we 're extremely similar to the yanks but that europeans are just different and strange ( usually because of the language barrier making it really hard to empathise ) . 
  but i think stuff like this shows that they 're wrong ( as do many surveys on public attitudes ) . 
   a dedicated / r/conspiracy [ 1 ] or / pol / member could i 'd be more surprised if an / r/conspiracy type * has n't * come up with such a theory already . 
   yeah the history of the roma people is all kinds of crazy and depressing but hardly anyone seems to know about it a good example of this , is that you 'll hear people say from time to time that they are treated today kind of like jews were in the run up to the holocaust * despite the fact that the gypsies/romani people were gassed along side the jews and treated exactly the same as the jews * . 
  and yet the jews were given their own state and all of the remembrances of the holocaust focus on them , but we continue treating the gypsies like shit .

   people have been predicting doom from over population for a few centuries now and eventually we will doom ourselves because of it , unless we start expanding out into the stars or something . 
  we 're going to reach a point where the earth can tolerate no more humans , at least not at the quality of life that we currently expect , and i 'd rather we stop making more and more humans * before * that point and not * after * that point . 
  i mean , if we 're already stopping having so many children naturally , we why would deliberately try and change that ? 
  it 's not like we have to deliberately try and push our planet as far as it will go . 
   it 'll be public for more than a year before it 's even voted on just want to really highlight this part . 
  i 'm very skeptical of ttip both in practice and principle and * normally * i would see suggests of `` oh let 's wait and see '' as a weasel word that politicians use to push things to the back of the agenda and then pass them when nobody 's paying attention . 
  * normally * that is what i would say , but with ttip i do n't because i think that a one year consultation phase is more than enough for the public , and the european parliament , to effectively scrutinise ttip * in the light of all the facts * . 
  like i say , i am skeptical of ttip , but i think that it would be silly to destroy the treaty before it 's even written because it * might * be bad . 
  we should acknowledge that even if it 's probably bad , there is a real opportunity for positives . 
  ttip is an opportunity to have * more * economic growth which has the potential to increase the standard of living for both europeans and americans . 
  economic growth will also help europe and the west retain their positive influence on world affairs against the rise of countries like china . 
  these are real tangible benefits that we should n't dismiss out of hand . 
  there are potential dangers too . 
  we risk lowering our consumer standards , our environmental standards and worker 's standards . 
  these are risks with any trade agreement . 
  striking the balance between preserving standards and allowing market competition . 
  you have to make a judgement about which areas would be benefitted by free trade , and which would be damaged . 
  if we get that balance wrong , then all of the benefits of increased economic growth would be wasted . 
  but we can not make that judgement about if the balance is right until the agreement has actually been written . 
  we should familiarise ourselves with the information we have so far , which is very minimal , and what sort of objectives we 're actually aiming for , and then , after we actually have the treaty finalised , we can judge it against that criteria , but not before . 
  to be fair , about three usa presidents have been shot in the past one hundred years ( two of them fatally ) and many others have had serious assassination attempts ( did n't george w. get a grenade throne at him ? ) . 
  i do n't know why ( well , i can think of some reasons ) but those guys just seem to be like magnets for bullets and murderous devices . 
  nobody seems to care much about european world leaders , apart from margaret thatcher , who got bombed twice ( which is why the british pm always has a big security detail ) but that was more to do with a small civil war that was going on at the time ( which is coincidentally why , if anybody became secretary of state for northern ireland they were given a security detail * for life * ) . 
  thank you for your understanding , 
  i would * n't * say so . 
  you can kind of guess because of the context of the conversation , but from the words themselves it 's almost impossible unless you speak a properly germanic language . 
  i mean , the only bit which will be familiar to english speakers or non germanic speakers is `` katol ... '' from catholic . 
  the kyrkan bit i could only guess because it 's vaguely similar to the german word `` kirche '' ( church ) .
