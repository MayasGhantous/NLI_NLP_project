  interestingly , it was the british labour party who was governing then , with the party split between moderate social democrats who support the european economic community and hard leftists , democratic socialists who wanted to leave . 
  the conservative party at that time was fully in support . 
  today the conservatives are split between modern progressive conservatives who support maintained membership and far right neo-liberal and neo-conservative thatcherites who want to leave . 
  how times have changed . 
  a manufacturing error is almost as bad as a design floor . 
  it casts a question mark over all planes created by airbus . 
  obviously mistakes do happen in all fields , no matter how capable you are or how many levels of oversight and testing there are , but planes have a special place in the public 's conciousness . 
  he 's said that he will likely support maintained eu membership , but that if brussels does n't offer any reforms , he could go either way . 
  to me that sounds code speak for ' i support eu membership , but i want to look tough so the public like me and i have a bargaining chip when i go to brussels ' . 
  i think harold wilson did the same thing iirc when he had a referendum . 
  went to brussels , got some paultry reforms and campaigned to stay in . 
  notice how miliband actually criticised the eu on the grounds that there should be * more * integration , not less ( energy market ) and his other criticisms are just small particular adendums . 
  lib dems are also in favour of eu reform , specifically , they want more of it . 
  nick clegg has written in favour of creating a common european foreign policy and a common eu army for defence . 
  his party also supported joining the eurozone until the 2008 ( and the party is still ideologically in support of it , they just ca n't say it publically ) . 
  conservatives and ukip on the other hand , all want * less * eu . 
  that 's the key difference . 
  it 's like any other election . 
  the right wing parties want less government , whilst the left wing parties want more government . 
  it applies to eu level as well as national level . 
  i think the conservatives are a bit more eurosceptic than you 're making out . 
  you 've got to keep in mind that david cameron is perhaps one of the most left wing , pro eu conservatives in the party and even he is n't actually pro-eu . 
  there 's hardly any conservatives who are actually * happy * with the eu the way it is . 
  the last tory government opted out of eu measures wherever it could ( most notably on a whole raft of crime measures and the eurozone debt crisis ) . 
  the conservative party * en masse * has also been against the european convention on human rights ever since thatcher and has pledged to withdraw the uk from the convention ( which they 're now going to try and do , even though i ca n't see how , because you have to be signatory of the convention in order to be an eu member ) . 
  additionally , whilst the paragraph above describes how moderate conservatives such as cameron view things , the hard right , eurosceptic back benches of the conservative party , led by john redwood , has only grown over the decades . 
  there 's a whole handful of potential defectors to ukip . 
  it 's not just mark reckless ( who thankfully lost his seat ) and douglass carswell . 
  plus : the government is a lot smaller than it was before . 
  in the previous government , cameron could rely on the liberal democrats as a sort of surrogate liberal wing of his own party , allowing the far right the far right to rebel . 
  it 's one of the reasons the gay marriage bill passed parliament , despite a majority of tory mps rebelling ( labour helped from across the floor too ) . 
  but the conservatives ' majority is smaller than the thatcherite wing of the party now , so they can easily hold the rest of the party to ransom , and if they need extra ( small ` c ' ) conservative support , they 'll be relying on the ulster unionists and the democratic unionist part ( both from northern ireland ) who are just plain super-conservatives filled with bile . 
  and cameron ca n't rely on the labour party or the snp from across the floor to help him pass legislation because they want to see his government fall . 
  it 's not as super-conservative and ideaologically right wing as a lot of left-wing commentators are making out . 
  cameron is ver progressive for a conservative , but you have to remember that he is to the left of his own party and that many conservative rebels could push the party further rightwards . 
  for those that are dead set against conservatism and the conservatives , it 's not going to be * that * bad , but it will be a lot worse than the last five years . 
  sorry but this has been de-listed until a source is provided . 
  --   * have experience as a moderator ( or similar )  yes could you expand on this , slightly ? 
  i was looking this up a few weeks ago . 
  at that point they were in favour of electoral reform ** but had a preference for the alternative vote ** which we already rejected at referendum . 
  it was weird . 
  they might have changed their mind since then . 
  it 's been a very volatile few weeks , and obviously a new leader may take a new approach . 
  the vote numbers are n't * quite * as unfair as what 's in the board at the moment . 
  it 's just that seat numbers have been updated whilst total vote count has n't, 
  there 'll be a leadership competition , and an interim leader will take over until then . 
  that 's what happened after brown lost . 
  he resigned as leader and has been moping around westminster ever since , whilst harriet harman took on the leadership of the party until an internal election could be held . 
  this will be exactly the same . 
  i think if you do what you wanted to do , you should use single quotes . 
   ` like this ' it implies that you are quoting * something * but that it 's not a specific something . 
  like when you 're reciting a proverb . 
  if you use double quote ,  `` like this '' it means you 're quoting someone specific , such as the person you 're responding too . 
  the problem you 're talking about already exists because rural constituencies are so much larger than urban ones ( urban ones can be a mile or two across , where as rural ones can be tens of miles squared ) . 
  it would n't be particularlly worse under a proportional system , because the demographics of rural areas is different to urban ones and would therefore be targeted by particular parties . 
  for instance , rural constituencies tend to vote conservative where as urban centres tend to be labour . 
  on a different note : what you 're talking about is not the reason we have the voting system we do . 
  the reasons which are given usually for supporting fptp is a ) why fix what is n't broke and b ) fptp provides strong , single party government rather than uncertain coalition negotiations . 
  i get what you 're saying , but there 's a big difference between cutting because you want to , and cutting because you think you need to . 
  personally i do n't think it 's a good way to do it and i prefer borrowing and taxation measures , but i also do n't think you 're being fair to the conservative 's perspective on it . 
  there 's a difference between being right of social democracy and being conservative . 
  the brand of labourism developed by blair was something new . 
  it 's essentially communitarianism . 
  blair and schr\u00f6der were not neo-conservative . 
  there * were * genuinely conservative elements in those parties . 
  new labour ( a.k.a. 
  blair 's labour party ) integrated quite a few burkian ideas of valuing stability over radical change , and family values . 
  there were also the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders , which were a bit authoritarian ( which is more associated with conservatism ) as was some of the terrorism legislation . 
  ** however ** that level of authoritarianism is ** nothing ** compared to what * actual * conservatives would do . 
  theresa may , current uk home secreary ( interior minister ) wanted to expand anti-terrorism legislation even further and bring back gagging orders which stop certain individuals from being able to be seen or heard on national television or radio . 
  additionally , the current work and pensions secretary ( ian duncan smith ) is using the benefits system to impose their views on family stability ( by limiting child benefit to the first two children and such like ) . 
  labour and the spd would never do those things , and the blair administration did lots of social democratic things like introducing a minimum wage , which is the same thing sigmar gabriel 's social democrats in germany are doing right now . 
  the conservatism of the labour party and the sdp has got nothing on the conservatism of the conservatives and the christian democratic union . 
  it 's basically entirely because of the coalition . 
  there 's no demographic factors , if that 's what you mean . 
  however , i think the lib dems handled their coalition extremely poorly . 
  they personally voted for a rise in tuition fees when they made a personal pledge that they would abolish them entirely . 
  they should have agreed to at least abstain . 
  it made them seem incredibly two faced to do a * complete * u-turn . 
  i think partially , though , the lib dems had a lot of support they did n't deserve . 
  at the time of the last election , they had a lot of support from the right wing and the left wing of politics . 
  in reality , you have to be either left wing or right wing . 
  you ca n't be everything to everyone . 
  they 've been cut down to the core support that they do very much earn and do genuinely believe in the lib dem 's policies . 
   how would they be able to help their constituents ? 
  they ca n't do a lot . 
  they can just use their standing as an mp to help settle local problems and talk to constituents about their problems . 
  they ca n't really * do * much . 
  they can also influence other sein fein people , such as those running local councils . 
   do they receive money from the party to spread around the ridings ? 
  nopes . 
   is there a vote subsidy ? 
  what do you mean by a vote subsidy ? 
  do they get something in return for not taking up their seats ? 
   though they do n't take up their seats , do they help draft legislation they do n't . 
  it 's a pretty bad deal for sein fein . 
  they can ask other mps individually to do things , but there 's almost no incentives for those mps to listen . 
  a quick serious question ? 
  any sort of question of any length is welcomed with open arms !, 
  sein fein wants northern ireland to be part of the republic of ireland ( instead of the united kingdom ) .
