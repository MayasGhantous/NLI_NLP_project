  for example , we may have ear marked somebody primarily for their css skills , but all of the community moderators may turn out to be great css wizards . 
  that would somewhat negate the need for the originally ear marked mod . 
  so what i am saying is that it may change and it would be very embarrassing and somewhat cruel to the mod that we drop at the last second if we were to announce them and then change our minds . 
  i think at this point it does n't really matter what islam is actually about . 
  there 's plenty of excellent articles on how modern islamic terrorism and organisations that perpetrate it ( al qaeda , isil , etc ) are a schism with the rest of islam . 
  the important thing is , that the islamists ( those wanting to basically kill everything ) get annoyed when pictures of the prophet are printed , and it 's those people we 're trying to annoy . 
  printing pictures of the prophet whenever they do something to stop is printing pictures of the prophet basically ruins the purpose of their actions even when you use their own warped sense of logic . 
  so hopefully it will be able to a ) stop some small number of terrorist attacks and b ) shift moderate-ish muslims away from islamists by demonstrating their insanity . 
  hi , thanks for the report . 
  we 've removed it now for being incorrect . 
  you need to be crystal clear what 's a joke and what 's not . 
  what you 've basically done is made an incorrect title to draw people to your post , despite that title not being true ( or funny ) . 
  so sorry , but we 're gon na delist this submission . 
  you can post it again with a different ( correct ) title and the source . 
  did you actually read the article ? 
  illegal refugees who have no right to stay will be sent back . 
  the purpose of the quotas is to ensure real refugees are distributed equally across eu member states , so that border states like greece and italy do n't get unfairly large amounts . 
  for the one millionth time , would you link to a source . 
  if you keep posting all sorts of content without a source , hoping that the mods miss it , then we 're eventually going to have to revoke your posting abilities . 
  you 've been here long enough to know that you need a source . 
  my personal preference is for allowing in a much wider array of people ( but not everybody ) , but i also acknowledge that there are other humane approaches which we can all come to a compromise on . 
  for instance , the german interior minister has recommended setting up european detainment centres on the african side of the mediterranean where asylum applications could be logged and rejected . 
  this would limit the number of people bothering to make the crossing , if they know their asylum claim will be rejected even if they do survive . 
  for those that make the journey despite all of the above , we can simply increased border patrol efforts through frontex , which will pick up these boats and send them back to the asylum centres in africa . 
  whilst this is n't my first choice , i think it is preferable to creating an entire buffer zone of dictators on the north coast of africa , and it 's likely something most europeans can compromise on as a good middle way . 
  yeah . 
  that is a good thing . 
  he tried to ** airstrike ** a crowd of ** his own people ** who were protesting . 
  i know it 's pretty hard to say that anything is better than civil war , but at the end gaddafi was pretty bad . 
  i think that europe can find a way to deal with this , without needing to have a fascist protecting our southern border . 
  there 's more humane ways . 
  i think everything i said was an over simplification . 
  the text book i have right in front of me dedicates almost a hundred pages to socialism , anarchism and communism * each * . 
  there 's huge amounts of differences in human nature and historical dialectics that i entirely left out from socialism and communism . 
  the thing is , if you want to know what the really core , most fundamental differences between these three ideologies are , then i think my comment is pretty good . 
  it is in no way comprehensive . 
  it just explains what the key difference is . 
   then the entire higher education system would collapse overnight , since what this student describes is the experience of every single person in possession of a degree or higher level qualification . 
  not necessarily . 
  it 's only courses which say they are a certain way or have certain standards , but in reality you can objectively prove that those standards are not met . 
  what i 'm talking about what i 'm essentially talking about is false advertising . 
  if you buy into something knowing it 's shit , then that 's entirely up to you . 
  if a seller promises something about a product and that promise is not met , then you have a right to a refund . 
  that 's what happened in this case . 
  the student is not suing the university over the course being bad . 
  she is suing because the course was worse than advertised . 
   well she said communication was difficult , and having two languages to help in a conversation is pretty helpful . 
  if two people are communicating at a university level , then they both have to have top-level of understand in the same language . 
  for instance , i 'm an advanced german speaker , and a fluent english speaker . 
  i have a friend who is advanced english and native german . 
  neither of us can effectively communicate opinions to each other about , let 's say , the ideological shifts in the british labour party ( something i study ) or the science behind blood transfusions ( something she studies ) . 
  you need to have a shared language that you are both fluent in , in order to talk at university level about such topics . 
  learning 10 % of a different language wo n't plug the gap . 
  the main difference between most foreign students and domestic students is that domestic students , even in the us and uk , pay their tuition fees using debt . 
  there 's almost no upfront costs and it effectively works like a graduate tax on earnings after they get a degree . 
  foreign students , on the other hand , usually have family members pay for this and if they 're not from a particularly wealthy background it can have a pretty negative impact . 
  but anyway , this is , imho , getting away from the real issue . 
  if a course that you 've applied to is not as described , you really ought to be compensated in some way . 
  even if you pay no money , you 've still given up your chance to go to a different university for those three or four years of your life . 
  no it isn . 
  and no . 
  no we 're not . 
  communism and socialism in practice look almost identical , but they have very different goals . 
  in socialism , the state basically controls everything . 
  wealth is also redistributed to ensure absolute equality . 
  however , under communism , such a state will be created , but the idea is that eventually this state will wither away and leave a classless society of equals behind . 
  so essentially the end goal of communism is anarchy , where as the end goal of socialism is just more socialism . 
  if you 're wondering what the difference between anarchism and communism is . 
  it 's basically that communism believes in an intermediary stage between anarchy and our current where we are now ( capitalism ) in which we are all become equal ( by creating a sort of socialist state ) . 
  on the other hand , anarchism believes that we should just get rid of the government right away and everything will be fine . 
  do people really need to constantly asociate every user who happens to be british with the political background of the uk ? 
  you know it 's only an extreme minority of the uk electorate who hold these views on the balkans , etc ? 
  half the replies i 've got in the last week have directly invoked my nationality . 
  it gets old . 
  i 'd like my ideas and comments to be evaluated on their own merits without people 's prejudices of the british being brought into it, 
  do you think the resignation of podemos ' leader will have a significant impact on the party and on spain 's political landscape ? 
  i know that a large portion of former yugoslavia countries are now eu members ( slovenia and croatia ) and that they are all most certainly european . 
  however , / u/wummies asked about the balkans specifically so i provided facts on balkan immigration to switzerland , and provided information on other large eu immigrant groups for context . 
  i did n't implicitly imply anything . 
  i simply answered the question which was posed . 
  balkan groups , especially from former yugoslavia , do make up a considerable portion of non swiss permanent residents . 
  they make up about 300,000 collectively ( roughly counting ) . 
  however , other european immigrant groups are much higher . 
  germany and italy have over 300,000 each . 
  france has about 100,000 and spain has about 70,000 . 
  so former yugoslavia is one of the major groups , but it 's not more significant than any of the others .

  negative five vites for providing a sourced comment which directly answers somebody 's question ; fuck me , right ? 
  removed until source provided, 
  well actually you only have one sixty millionth of the votes in the uk as opposed to one three hundred millionth of the votes in the eu . 
  you 're still just one person and get one vote . 
  it does n't make much difference if that vote is for a guy at westminster or a guy at brussels . 
  if the governance is better done at a european level then it should be done there , likewise for westminster and local level, 
  `` never before have federal republic of germany politicians so studiously avoided telling their countrymen the truth '' does n't roll of off the tongue in the same way , but has the added benefit of being broadly correct . 
  tbf : if we had a european army , it would probably mean we 'd go to war a lot less , because of the difficulties of ensuring that enough member states agree . 
  it probably would n't be decided on a consensus ( every single person agreeing ) basis like most decisions are currently , but it would still probably have to be more than half ( qualified majority voting , perhaps ) . 
  so if you really value limiting european nations military involvement , binding us all together is probably a good way to do it . 
  the thing is , if merkel lets the euro fail , she 'll be punished more harshly at the polls than if she simply gave too much money to greece . 
  if she can somewhat try and win the public round , even if it 's only a little bit , then that will mitigate even some of those consequences .
