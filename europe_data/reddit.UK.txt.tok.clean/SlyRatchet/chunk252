  in some specialists shops ( there 's about two in the city that i know of ) you can buy le monde ( french ) and el pais ( spanish ) but that 's only if you 're lucky . 
  to be honest the reason i picked these language courses was becaue they were free for students of my * uhem * educational establishment ( * trying to be as vague as possible my identity * ) . 
  the problem is , at the moment i just do n't have the time . 
  we 've entered exam season now and i 've dropped both french and spanish until further notice and in september i 'll hopefully be starting russian as part of my degree . 
  we 'll see how it goes . 
  if i can keep spanish going with a better teacher i 'll take it , but i 'm not hopeful . 
  kind of like a cyst that hangs onto the host body , extracting the language knowledge as you go . 
  or maybe that 's just me . 
  odly i think romantic partners are some of the people who 're most willing to actually share their language with you , where as almost everybody else feels socially awkward about it or something . 
  i 'd be inclined to agree with you under normal language learning circumstances , but i 'm only doing one spanish lesson a week and very little outside work . 
  if we were having lessons three times a week or more and i was really chugging away at it i would potentially prefer being mostly taught in spanish , but at the moment it just makes it stressful and very confusing because we 've all forgotten everything by the time we come back every week and it does n't stay in our heads because we leave every day feeling so confused . 
  also , it 's been taught at a * really * slow pace . 
  we spent the entire year focusing on talking about specific themes and social situations , like ordering food , introducing ourselves , asking for directions . 
  we have n't even started doing tenses and we can barely do questions ( i had to look up how to do questions that do n't start with a question word like who , what , where , why myself ) . 
  compare that to french , where we 'd done all of those specific situations and cracked through about five tenses in a single year . 
  too extremes . 
  i think at some point in the not too distant future i will visit a spanish speaking country and then i 'll either start learning to love it and learn it , or i wont . 
  either way , in the long run i 'll be learning it because of it 's own merits , rather than my teacher 's . 
  hopefully . 
  learning swedish ? 
  you swj you !, 
  why 'd you want to go and do a thing like that ? 
  english ( native ) status : frequently corrected by english-as-a-second-language speakers . 
  errors : grammar , spelling , punctuation , apostrophes , pronounciation ( mild yorkshire accent : worse than being foreign ) . 
  desire to learn foreign languages : zero . 
  * rule britannia , britannia rules the waves !, 
  i describe myself as speaking speaking ** 1.75 languages . 
  ** the one comes from ** english ** which i speak at a somewhat reasonable level . 
  i 'm intermediate in ** german ** . 
  i like to participate in the model german bundestag ( / r/mbundestag ) and you can see my level of ability in the comments there [ such as this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mbundestag/comments/338qkv/debatte_11_vorratsdatenspeicherung/cqlc0pv ) . 
  i 'm also learning ** french and spanish ** ( french for two years and spanish for one ) . 
  i 'm thinking of giving up on spanish . 
  the spanish classes i participated in were so awful . 
  the teacher had hardly a grasp of english and is obviously not that interested in the job , but instead just uses it to fund her travels . 
  this is in juxtaposition to my french teacher who is absolutely amazing . 
  native french speaker but has lived in yorkshire for a long time and was actually born to norwegian parents . 
  also just a very nice lady . 
  i 'm hoping to start picking up ** russian ** as aprt of a degree course because the employability is amazing and i 'd quite like to actually get my teeth around a challenging language , and a look into a european culture that 's just very different ( in comparison to the uk , ireland , germany , austria , switzerland , france , spain , belgium , which are in imho culturally very similar ) . 
  this has been removed under rules 2.5 . and 2.6 . 
  jobs in south america . 
  we 're stimulating the chilean economy guys !, 
  its all part of our long term economic plan !, 
  maybe if we ignore them they 'll think they 're a ghost ... 
  this has been delisted . 
  tbf , even i , as a moderator of / r/europe and several other subs , think this rule is stupid . 
  the way you 've set it up at the moment , i could walk in and say that there was a genocide of scottish people during 2010 ( there was n't ) and any one who disagrees with me would be breaking the rules , but i , as the person spreading misinformation , would be fine . 
  so that means that you 're obviously going to allow the questioning of some genocides but not others , so you might as well say in the rules which genocides are above questioning . 
  on / r/europe we identified two specific genocides which are above questioning and ban , because it 's only people trumpeting extreme xenophobic views that would deny it . 
  i highly recommend you do the same . 
  not all historical acts are above question . 
  not all fingers are thumbs , but all thumbs are fingers . 
  there 's some eurozone countries that are n't at the centre of the eu , but there 's no countries at the centre of the eu that are n't euro members . 
  it 's a prequirement , not a guarantee . 
  of course it would be your duty to help , but your avoiding the real question , which is do you think denmark has more of a duty to help simply by proximaty ? 
  you can argue it by culture , but if the numbers are small enough not to have a serious effect on the whole culture , than surely it is acceptable to let a few people from drastically different cultures in . 
  and btw , you 're implicitly making a statement which is not born out by the facts . 
  that people would flock to the richest place ( dubai in your example ) . 
  this is n't necessarily true . 
  you 're kind of assuming that their economic migrants who actually care about getting somewhere wealthy where they can earn money , as opposed to somewhere safe . 
  the eu is obviously both , but people come here because they are fleeing persecution or war as i pointed out in another comment in this thread . 
  suddenly , the german minority in belgian rises !, 
  but yes if i could vote in favour of euro membership , i would . 
  i want the uk to be at the heart of europe , not the periphery . 
  i would hope that we 'd make some form of fiscal union a pre-requisite of our joining . 
  i know non of this will happen , but a europhile can dream . 
  i think it 's a bit rich for you to call the governments of the almost 20 european countries that use the euro half-brained . 
  i 'd sooner but my economy in their hands than yours , euro notwithstanding . 
  it 's similar in the uk . 
  half of the labour ( social democratic ) party was in favour of entering the euro in the early 2000s , and the small liberal democrat party were entirely in favour , whilst the conservatives were against . 
  now all parties will deny that they are in favour of the euro ( although the liberal democrats will likely support it again as soon as possible ) . 
  no it is n't . 
  there are reports of large drownings of refugees on their way to australia . 
  the do n't know how many exactly because the australian government refuses to give statistics . 
  it could well be in excess of 3,500 per year . 
  and the countries directly adjacent to the war zones also have those rights . 
  if germany were to suddenly start pouring out refugees , would you be ok with denmark accepting all of them because denmark happens to be a neighbouring country ? 
  i assume you would say no , and hope that the entire international community accepts its fair share of the german refugees . 
  if the entire international community , or even the entire european union , accepts a reasonable share of the problem , the effects will be almost invisible in every individual state * and * we get to save people, 
  i 'm not suggesting we fix the entire world , although i do n't see any problem with that being a very long term objective . 
  i 'm suggesting that we make governments in the middle east and north africa tolerable . 
  they do n't have to be democracies , they do n't have to be perfect . 
  they just have to be stable and be better than the things they replace . 
   an economic and social burden . 
  that 's actually not true . 
  european countries need immigration to deal with our radically aging population , and with the increasing number of people going to university . 
  in the uk , for instance , half the population goes to university now . 
  however , this leaves relatively few people to do physical labour . 
  additionally , you 've got to keep in mind that whilst 200,000 a year sounds like a lot , it 's actually relatively small when you spread it across the whole eu , which has a population of approximately 500,0000,000 . 
  with that in mind , 200,000 people would probably be about the yearly birthrate if europe actually hate as a high a birth rate as most other countries . 
  and lastly  a country ca n't be expected to take in hundreds of thousands in a single year when they come from so different cultures . 
  no country need accept `` hundreds of thousands '' a year . 
  because i address this issue in the plan . 
  there would need to be a common european refugee policy which would spread the refugees around europe according to population to spread the burden fairely . 
  this would limit any sudden strain on social services or any ` cultural ' problems you may have . 
  yes , there would still be refugees being accepted into the european union , and in absolute terms there would be many of them , but divided between the various eu members the effects would be minimal and hardly noticible . 
  and we will save hundreds of thousands of lives in the process . 
  forgive me for being idealistic , but do you not think we should at least attempt a reasonable and humane response ( such as the one i outlined above ) before we switch to deporting all refugees ? 
  it seems a tad extreme to jump so quickly to isolationism and introversion when there are other possibilities in the table . 
  my first proper gilding !, 
  i feel as though i should curtsy or something * curtsies *,
