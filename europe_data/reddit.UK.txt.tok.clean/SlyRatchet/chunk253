  do n't forget to report things you believe are editorialised !, 
  ( i 've removed the submission for that reason ) . 
  this has been removed for editorialising . 
  yeah , i 'll make a further edit . 
  i 've edited the comment to include a much larger un report , for your perusing pleasure . 
  your primary source is whatever happens to come up on a google search result ? 
  so you have no actual information to back up what you are saying , as opposed to the un report which contradicts you . 
  you 're only datum is that the refugees on some of the points are of working age and sex . 
  you know that the eldery , children and mothers are often too weak to make the journey . 
  despite that , many mothers with children have died making the crossing and at least 10,000 * unnacompanied * children have made the crossing at the time the un report i linked to was published . 
  i 'm not denying that there are economic migrants on those boats . 
  they 're just a minority and should not an impact on the way we deal with those fleeing conflict zones and persecution , which is the majority . 
   many do not come from a warzone , but are just seeking better economic conditions . 
  they can , and should , be deterred and prevented from crossing . 
  actually most of them do come from warzones , or at least places of extreme persecution as i explained in [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33cv92/if_you_want_to_stop_migrants_crossing_the/cqjutt8 ) . 
  and instead of stopping * all * of these migrants from coming here , we should just go with the system we already have , which is to put them into asylum centres until we can determine whether to grant them asylum or not . 
  it is at this point we will determine of they are economic migrants ( and should therefore be sent back ) or whether they are refugees and should be granted asylum . 
   i disagree . 
  these people need to intensify efforts to improve their living conditions in the places they live in . 
  the living conditions in those countries should definitely be improved and we should be the first to come forward and help them with that . 
  the reasons their countries are in the sorry state they are in is largely because of european colonisation , which is not only something which still scares those countries , but also something which every european today still benefits from . 
  our countries got rich of the extraction of assets ( including human beings ) in those countries . 
  but even if that were not the case , we have an obligation to help them as human beings . 
  ** edit begin ** : i do n't know who the user who deleted their comments above and below this comment is . 
  i ca n't see him anywhere ele in this thread . 
  but they were claiming that the migrants crossing the mediterranean were mainly economic migrants . 
  ** end edit ** no they 're not . 
   since 2013 , the region has witnessed a sharp increase in the numbers of refugees and migrants crossing the mediterranean . 
  in the first seven months of 2014 , over 87,000 people arrived in italy by sea , with the two largest groups coming from eritrea and syria . 
  [ source : the united nations ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a02d9346.html ) syria : civil war ( obviously ) eritrea : [ worst human rights record in the world according to huaman rights watch . 
  ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20060211174118/https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/eritre12307.htm ) these are ** not ** economic migrants . 
  edit : for those saying this is not enough information , i refer you to [ page 24 of this un report ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/551128679.html ) which highlights that 200,000 syrians and almost 90,000 eritreans made asylum applications between 2013 and today . 
  the total figure of people crossing the mediterranean bewteen the beginning of 2013 is estimated in the low hundreds of thousands , so syrians and eritreans quite clearly make up the majority , without evening counting refugees from other countries who might make the crossing , such as the 20 thousand from somalia . 
  so , sending back refugees fleeing conflict , persecution , etc should just be sent back ? 
  that does n't solve the problem anymore than what we were doing before does . 
  the australian measures should only be implemented as an absolute last resort , and even then i 'm skeptical of if they should be used . 
  instead of sending people back to die in africa and the middle east ( after they risked death at sea ) , we should ** firstly ** focus on supporting those countries which are the source of these refugees through ** financial , logistic and , when necessary , military ** help in order to create stable and inclusive governments which hold a monopoly on the use of force and use said force responsibly . 
  this is something we 've started to do by having some of the highest overseas aid budgets in the world as a percent of gdp , but that money needs to be a ) better target , so as to not be eaten up by corruption in those governments , and b ) raised further because whilst eu members still have the highest aid budgets in the world , that amounts to only 0.7 % of gdp or less . 
  we intervene occasionally in african and middle eastern affairs , but only in extreme circumstances ( e.g. 
  libya , after gadaffi tried to airstrike protesters , or mali , chad and syria after the rise of shockingly violent islamist groups ) and without any sort of military force to keep the peace during the transition from dictatorship/civil war to stability . 
  *** secondly *** , ** we should target the human traffickers and people smugglers , rather than the refugees ** . 
  human trafficking between europe and the outside world is a multi-billion euro industry . 
  it effects not only refugees in the mediterranean , but also the trafficking of sex workers from east asia to the european union ( and by this i mean sex workers who are here against their will , and can often be children ) . 
  the refugees are not to blame here . 
  they are needy and desparate . 
  these smuggling wrings are the ones putting their lives at risk and penetrating international boarders illegally , for profit . 
  they are the ones who are sending these people across the med in these extremely overburdened and often unseaworthy crafts . 
  in the bullet points drawn by up eu foreign ministry mogherini in the immediate aftermath they have finally agreed to sink the boats of the smugglers once the people have been saved , thus damaging the financial assets of the smuggling wring , but this is not enough . 
  we must go further . 
  ** in the meantine ** , whilst we are furthering these measures , to stop the flow of refugees at the source , we should continue to help those who make it to our borders because they are desparate human beings . 
  the ones who are left behind in the warzones and dictatorships and so on are also needy and require our assistance , and we should grant them that . 
  but in the meantime we ** should not ignore those who have arrived at our door step ** , having risked their lives to come here ( and many who never make it here ) . 
  we should accept them into the eu and develop a ** common european refugee settlement policy ** which distributes refugees around the eu who arrive at our borders , so that the burden does not feel on some memberstates disproportionately . 
  azerbaijan is n't tht bad, 
  i ca n't get into a big discussion the various perspectives on ideologies and international relations , but i will say that idealism and pragmatism are * not * mutually exclusive . 
  you can behave in an idealist and pragmatic way . 
  the thing is , you need moral standards and objectives to guide your decision making , so you know what you 're working towards . 
  but you ca n't be a complete kantian about it . 
  you have to acknowledge that there are limits on your abilities and that sometimes ( often ) you have to make sacrifices in one area to make progress in another . 
  geo-politics is n't good or bad . 
  it 's just a word for the interaction between states . 
  there 's nothing inherently good or bad about that . 
  what matters is what we do with it . 
  in my opinion , morality is always guidiny how nations behave domestically and with other nations . 
  tbf : it is quite unusual for a banking supervisor to also be a prostitute . 
  it 's a bit mean to say that it 's * only * geo-politics . 
  the reason calling something a genocide is even noteworthy is because it carries big emotional weight , becase it is a big moral issue . 
  for instance , i could spin the interpretation differently , so that instead of the eu using the recognition of the armenian genocide to punish turkey for lurching to the far right and being too friendly with enemies of the west , the negaives of the recognition of the genocide are now outweighed by the positives . 
  european governments perhaps wanted to recognise the genocide , but felt that doing so would damage relations with turkey and risk slowing their ascesion to the eu ( and therefore hurting the people who live in turkey ) . 
  now that turkey is much less aligned , it is permissible for them to recognise the genocide because the marginal damage to relations with turkey will be so slim . 
  so yes , the reason they are recognising it now is because of geo-politics , but the fundamental reason is largely about morality . 
  it 's just that their is now finally a geo-political opportunity to recognise it . 
  i think it 's pretty fair to call them weak if you compare them against what they could be . 
  for instance , a lot of measures are about ` increasing cooperation ' between agencies which basically means ` we do n't really have a proper solution , but co-operation is always good so we 'll do some of that ' . 
  the problems are n't really caused by a lack of co-operation and the potential for the problem to be fixed by increased co-operation are pretty minimal . 
  this motion is similarly weak `` a eu wide voluntary pilot project on resettlement , offering a number of places to persons in need of protection ; '' because it 's only ` voluntary ' . 
  some of the measures they could have included would be to take action in the countries where these migrants are coming from ( which would actually deal with the cause of the problem , rather than the side effects ) , ranging from aid , giving/sharing personel , military support und other similar measures . 
  additionally , the only measure announced which directly effects the traffickers themselves is the destruction of their boats when they 're captured . 
  there 's no other serious measures against them , for instance , there 's no large scale operation to persue them across eu or international borders , or attack the organisational structure of these smuggling rings . 
  all action is limited to dealing with the consequences of the root problem , and only dealing with it within eu territory . 
  i also highly expect the actual financial investment in the project to be somewhat meagre , although this point any more money is good . 
  i disagree . 
  all of them are good motions , it 's just that most of them are quite weak . 
  there is a really significant point you missed out though . 
   a systematic effort to capture and destroy vessels used by the smugglers . 
  the positive results obtained with the atalanta operation should inspire us to similar operations against smugglers in the mediterranean ; this hits the smugglers where it hurts : their assets . 
  right now , i basically mean `` people from english speaking cultures '' . 
  so i 'm including all the british mods and the american mod . 
  removed for editorialising . 
   get rid of asylum right . 
  i do n't know if you want to be corrected or it , but ` asylum right ' is a heavy germanicism ( das asylrecht ) and in english it 's right of asylum . 
  it 's unclear what you mean , otherwise . 
  sorry if this is unwanted . 
  the taliban were the ones who controlled afghanistan and fought to defend al q , but pakistan was always notionally in support of the western alliance . 
  it 's arguable , although contested , that the pakistan government did not know osama bin laden was in their country . 
  you 're right . 
  it just hosted terrorists who carried out the attack on the world trade centre and other monuments , knowing full well that they would do this and pledging to fight before it would give them up . 
  that 's completely different . 
  i think if someone jumps into a small room and starts shouting then no reasonable debate can take place , no matter what the strengths and weaknesses of either side 's argument . 
  that 's what happens with brigading .
