  please do n't leave :( we love you . 
  you 're like a greek version of / u/savannejeff who frequently posts stuff which is controversial ( read : certain people consistently downvote it ) but is still really good quality content and we 're all enriched by reading it, 
  sorry i thought this post was about a different serial thread . 
  i 've edited my original comment . 
  as for being lazy , the specific phrasing you used was `` ca n't be bothered '' which is paramount to the same thing . 
  you 're accusations of dictatorial tendencies appare incredibly earnest . 
  if you are being sarcastic , may i suggest you add a sarcasm sign ( / s ) . 
  the reason we did n't make an announcement is precisely because we did n't think people would care tht much . 
  there 's many hundreds of minor decisions which have to be made every week and / r/europe would just e filled with meta posts if we submitted it all . 
  i , too , frequently desire to conquer entire countries and outlaw freedom of speech . 
  i really should improve my self control before something bad happens, 
   `` to stop feeling stagnant '' but i call bullshit the `` what happened in your country '' thing is sill being posted every week . 
  the only thing we 're doing is unstickying it after a couple of days instead of waiting the entire week . 
  please stop sensationalising this . 
  as for being lazy , you are aware that all the moderators do this in their free time out of charity ? 
  we 're in the process of adding more moderators to deal with the workload ( we have n't enlarged the team since we were only 60,000 users in size ) but it will take a long time for this to come to a conclusion . 
  we 're happy for people to discuss anything relating to the sub reddit and as ever we 'll be watching the discussion closely . 
  edit : removed a paragraph because i thought this was about a different serial thread ( places to visit in ), 
  delisted under rules 2.2 and 2.5, 
  relisted, 
  this has been delisted until a source is provided . 
  an east asian person in scotland ? 
  tbf you 're probably the only one they 'll have seen outside of a tv screen ( so long as you stay out of the university towns ), 
  you are aware that / r/europe is not a state ? 
  [ no matter how much we would like it to be ], 
  really ? 
  what sort of experiences have you had ? 
  xenophobia i think is the proper term . 
  still , they 're essentially the same thing . 
  it all boils down to hating people who are different to you because they are different to you . 
  the russian minority just disappeared ? 
   if you count anti-irish stuff as racist which you definitely should . 
  just because it 's seen as normal does n't mean it 's not racism or that it 's any less harmful or hateful . 
  we do n't think it 's a lot to expect that there be at least some suggestion of where the information in submissions to / r/europe is actually coming from . 
  as it stands , this submission could have been made by almost anybody and have little/nothing to do with the actual events of waterloo . 
  we consider it to be a good basic standard to at least link to where the content was found , and if it 's oc , then where the information for the submission was found . 
  it 's not a lot to ask , and unless we ask , then we could very easily be being mislead . 
  if there 's no way to proove that this submission has evidence supporting it , then it is just as bad as fake . 
  i was confused there . 
  i thought that varaufakis 's father was just big in the alcohol equipment manifuacturing business . 
  source . 
  that 's basically correct . 
  we 'll add any national or regional flag which belongs in europe . 
  we 'll also add national flags of countries outside of europe ( e.g. 
  america , canada , israel , etc ) the only flags we wo n't add , are sub national flags ( e.g. 
  us state flags ) from outside of europe and we usually do n't add historical flags ( although there 's the exception of the spanish second republic flag for complicated reasons ) . 
  we agree and this post has been removed because of it ( rule 2.5 , technically ) . 
  please report this sort of thing . 
  it 's really low quality content that belongs in a default , not here . 
  it 's called a ** nordic ** cross , not a scandinavian cross . 
  delisted until a source is provided . 
  but to be fair , all the leaders that came after him have been awful . 
  that 's definitely not the reason because we 've been having this low level of user participation since well before the last two weeks . 
  it 's been going on for months . 
  i really doubt the two are related . 
  maybe we can compromise on taking it down monday night/tuesday morning ? 
  lots of other people want the thing unsticked quickly because it makes it feel stagnant . 
  we did it reddit !, 
  bonus question : what high quality/interesting websites are there in your country ? 
  could even be something like tv5monde which does do some broadcasts in english but is distinctly french . 
  you 're saying trident does n't cost much in comparison to * the largest government department which accounts for almost all welfare spending * . 
  that 's not that surprising . 
  if you compare it to other departments , like education or transport agricultural and environment it would take a huge chunk out of their budgets . 
  would you remove french and german ( or even things like biology and history ) from the curriculum if nobody apart from natives were taking it ? 
  of course you would n't . 
  we need people with those language skills and the fact nobody is taking them is a sign that we need to make them more enticing ( for instance , by teaching them better , demonstrating how they 're valuable , etc ) . 
  with polish the utility * is * a little uncertain because we already have such a large polish speaking minority and they 're settling down , having kids and teaching their kids english and polish . 
  the point is , the utility of a subject is entirely separate from whether or not the subject is popular . 
  i hate the idea of dropping a subject purely because lack of demand . 
  it should be dropped if there is neither demand nor utility . 
  because : empire . 
  tl ; dr : all dem damn foreigners , kept living in their countries , and started speakin ' english , because the english took over their countries , and were really really bad at it ( the foreigners ) . 
  the bad speaking stuck , a long with many other new words ( like pajamas ) . 
  it 's definitely a ` z ' sound as in ** z ** ionism or trea ** s ** ure . 
  you can find examples of the letter * x * being pronounced like this in the word xylophone, 
  i 've never heard it used in a real sentence , unless we are * specifically * talking about grammar itself . 
  yeah , it 's usually stuff like redditor # 1 : `` you know when you 're at the urinals ? '', 
  redditor # 2 : `` yeaaah , been a while since i used a * male * bathroom ... '', 
   i think the eu would have less influence . 
  right now the eu has at least 2 members that command respect . 
  once those 2 countries are hamstrung by the * soldaten sind m\u00f6rder * crowd the whole world will know europe is militarily irrelevant . 
  the aversion to hard power that is dominate outside of a few countries is delusional and completely impractical . 
  everyone outside of left-wing europeans realize that . 
  perhaps the biggest factor in a nation 's hard power is the perceived willingness to use their assets . 
  everyone knows the us and russia are willing to fight , and that 's why they 're feared . 
  outside of france and the uk , eu countries command zero respect militarily . 
  i 'd like to point out firstly that left wing europeans are just as willing to intervene military than any other huge section of the political spectrum you wish to name . 
  the blair administration and the hollande administration are some of the most militarily active in recent history , especially in terms of taking a pro-active response to the world ( instead of a reactive one ) . 
  secondly , i 'd like to point out that europe is actually much more starkly divided on military issues than you realise . 
  perhaps it seems very passifist to you , and from an american perspective it generally is , but that absolutely does not mean that europe generally is unwilling to intervene where necessary . 
  almost every european state sent forces to afghanistan . 
  even the mightil passifist germans sent in soldiers in to the former yugoslavia . 
  asside from that , the eu 's military to initiate sanctions is a serious security risk to any country that wishes to confront the european union , and consolidating our foreign policy would allow us to come to decisions about sanctions much more quickly and therefore to have much much greater effect . 
  we have seen some positive results of a poorly soft power approach with iran and , so long as the greek trojan horse does n't buckle , it will lead to success in russia too . 
  so i catagorically disagree with everything you 've said in that paragraph and feel that the historical evidence i have given is many times greater than any which you have provided me in support of your position ( which is non ) . 
   all those problems can be solved simply by taking defense seriously and not treating military budgets as something that exists to be cut regularly . 
  that 's just not true . 
  high military spending is pointless if you do n't have the decision mechanisms and the unity to use it effectively . 
  the eu combined military expenditure is already more than russia . 
  the problem is that we are too divided to use it .
