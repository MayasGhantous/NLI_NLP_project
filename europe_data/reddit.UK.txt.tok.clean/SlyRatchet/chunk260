  the green party ( in england , at least ) are against both . 
  i understand what you 're saying about the needs for europe to have a strong military , and for the uk to retain it 's nuclear strike capabilities , but please look at this issue specifically before passing judgement on it . 
  the uk has a nuclear strike capability currently . 
  it will remain to do so . 
  what the conservatives are planning to do is create * more * nuclear submarines . 
  in addition to this , they also want to renew the trident nuclear missile technology . 
  why is this important ? 
  because doing either of these things ( and the conservatives want to do both ) would break the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , i.e. 
  the treaty which says the five major nuclear powers will * not * enlarge their nuclear arsenals and * not * share their nuclear weapons with the rest of the world . 
  why does this matter ? 
  because the very existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to humanity . 
  the uk alone has enough nuclear missiles to cause a nuclear winter , if all of them were launched at once , which would wipe out life on this planet as we know it . 
  russia and the usa between them have enough missiles already to destroy the planet many times over . 
  and as soon as any of these nations see a nuclear warhead heading towards them , they will immediately retaliate against all the other nuclear weapons states they suspect of firing the weapons . 
  we want as few nuclear weapons as possible , and preferably non . 
  if the uk breaks the nuclear non-proliferation treaty then we give the green light to russia and china , as well as america and france and the rest of the world ( the threat of nuclear armed iran is still a terrifying prospect ) , that the nnpt is ok to break and that we can all continue to expand our nuclear missile arsenals as much as we want , and in so doing , make the chances of our complete extinction ever more likely . 
  so you can talk about europe 's defence budget all you like . 
  you can tell the uk it should keep up its military spending on * conventional * forces . 
  but do * not * tell us to * expand * our nuclear aresnal . 
  no more nuclear weapons should be created . 
  we should be getting rid of them , not making more . 
  this submission has been removed for editorialising , under rule 2.3, 
  there 's always a choice . 
  greece is in debt , but it still an independent nation with a large ( if shrinking ) economy and has influence upon many very important organisations , not least the eu , eurozone and nato . 
  the world does n't break down easily into nations which have the power to make decisions , and nations which do n't . 
  they can all make decisions . 
  you did n't see this sort of coisying up to russia before syriza was voted into power . 
  if they had no choice , how come the change happened as soon as the greek people made a choice ? 
  if there 's really nothing anybody can do about it , then the previous government would have already been doing this . 
  but it did n't . 
  because they made a decision . 
  and syriza made a different one . 
  i ca n't seem to find any reference to this money in any other european news source . 
  thanks, 
  whilst the causes are interesting and somewhat important , i think the effects are much more relevant . 
  there 's a whole variety of reasons why / r/europe has become so large , and being a geo-default is chief among them , but the effects are that the amount of talking , joking and jiving with fellow europeans ; sharing ideas and experiences with each other ; building empathy and being exposed to new ways of interpreting the world and solving its problems ; has massively increased as a direct result of the large amount of users we have here . 
  that 's something that i am incredibly proud of , whatever the causes are . 
  burn !, 
  wait a second ... ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  relisted, 
  there 'd a filter for that in the sidebar, 
  this has been delisted until a source is provided, 
  but then what 's the point of it being your capital ? 
  that 's like saying ` let 's have someone who has all the functions of a president , but not call him the president , and give the title of president to somebody who does n't do anything presidential . 
  like that guy over there . 
  called bob . 
  bob 's a swell guy ' . 
  it just defeats the meaning of the word ` capital city ' . 
  because a capital city is * by definition * the city where everything is governed from . 
  i used to use sporcle a lot and i always do better than i expect with africa , until i have to spell out the country of mauritanious , or whatever it 's called . 
  it 's to the east of the western sahara directly west of mali, 
  we did that six months ago , and [ these were the results ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2i7a7f/the_reurope_user_flair_statistics_as_of_20141003/ ), 
  some sort of ... survey ... 
  [ slightly more familiar version ] ( https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=kbjcqyvtzmo ), 
  yeah , in a perfect we would have an impartial third language . 
  but that 's not feasible and therefore we should support the language which is already quite clearly the dominant one . 
  if i went to india , i would at least learn not to refer to their country as whatever the cultural equivalent of * hitlerland * is . 
  it 's common courtesy . 
  you learn * something * about the culture you 're visiting before you actually visit there , just to avoid coming off as a twazzack . 
   he british the liverpudlians hey !, 
  liverpool is like the least offensive british city . 
  if you want to hate on somewhere , hate on london for being full of self important ignoramuses who wo n't give you the time of day , or manchester for being a much small version of that , apart from it things that somehow it is the capital of the north ( which it is n't , because sheffield definitely has that title ) , or birmingham , because brummies sound like they could commit suicide at any moment . 
  you 've got so many to choose from , but you pick * liverpool * ? 
  what is wrong with you ? 
  usually it 's a mixture of the two . 
  they see people in the middle-east who hold similar beliefs to them being abused , and they themselves feel as though they have been abused , and therefore take up arms to support themselves and their bretheren . 
   needs a badass president . 
  [ is this man not badass enough for you ?!,

  how come you came here ? 
  ^ also , ^ is ^ [ this ] ( http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/23800000/greison-ratchet-and-clank-23860019-1600-1200.jpg ) ^ and ^ [ this ] ( http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/25800000/sly-himself-sly-cooper-25856285-211-238.jpg ) ^ what ^ you 're ^ thinking ^ of ? 
  where do you live currenty , if not in armenia ? 
  i have a feeling that you are now on a list , because you put other people on lists, 
  it would actually make a lot more sense to have rehabilitative rather than punitive measures against potential radical islamists . 
  many radical islamists have been personally shamed in some way by the west or believe that they in some way have been shamed . 
  however much they preach the qur ` an ( which is usually not very much , in the case of hard line islamists ) the rout cause is always personal or political , not religious . 
  there 's a reason isil dress their victims up in guantanamo bay clothing before executing them . 
  if we removed the shame from the system , we remove the rout cause of radical islamism . 
  edit : [ this new statesman article is a pretty good introduction to the causes of islamism ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2015/03/mehdi-hasan-how-islamic-islamic-state ), 
  even if there was a correlation between radicalisation and drinking mountain dew ( which there is n't ) , would it be right to completely ban mountain dew ? 
  to add on to that question , let 's imagine that instead of banning mountain dew , we banned people from saying that mountain dew tastes good . 
  obviously , these people are wrong because mountain dew is fucking disgusting , but they should non the less have the freedom to promote their chosen drink and build a religion to the putrid liquid that is mountain dew , because freedom of speech and freedom of religion are what it means to be part of a free society . 
  why 's this guy getting downvoted so much ? 
  thanks . 
  this has been de-listed pending a source for the information, 
  removed pending a source . 
  please provide a source that that there was a debate about changing the flag and that these are the proposals . 
  lithuanian sources are fine so long as they are credible . 
  you 've got some criticisms . 
  i do n't think this is perfect . 
  it 's certainly not up to the standards of national law , but that 's not what we 're trying to achieve here . 
  what we 're trying to achieve is progress on what we had before . 
  we 've got to start somewhere . 
  the reasons we 've had to make these rules so vague is a ) because if they went into anymore detail than they arleady do , it would become unreadably long . 
  so we made it as concise as possible . 
  this is a restriction that national law does not have to contend with . 
  b ) we are woefully ill equipped to foresee every possible eventuallity which is why we created a broad list of rules rather than a specific list . 
  it 's like the us constitution . 
  there are a mixture of elastic clauses which are open to interpretation and a mixture which are n't ( such as 2.1 and 2.2 . ) . 
  i agree that many parts of rule 1.1 are incredibly vague and that displeases me as much as it displeases you , but as a moderator who sees the sort of retarded bullshit which gets removed from this site everyday i can tell you that it is exactly necessary .
