  i honestly would n't expect it to be that difficult for you guys to find the source of most images/infographics posted here ; might it be possible to relatively loosely enforce this rule or loosen its conditions to be slightly more forgiving ? 
  it really only makes sense when it ca n't be verified , or the source ca n't be easily found . 
  if there is a watermark in the corner to a credible organisation , like an ngo , think tank , company , news organistions or something , then usually that is enough , especially in the case of stuff water marked from the economist . 
  if there 's no water mark then you just have to link to some internet source where you found it . 
  for instance , if you got it from wikipedia , the information should be cited at the bottom of the wikipedia page and ou can link to that . 
  if it 's an image , * and the op claims anything about the image in the title * then you * have * to link to a news source which includes the image * and * the information which is stated in the headline . 
  and yes , the mods * could * just search the entire interent for a source on behalf of every op . 
  technically , we * could * do that . 
  but we frankly have more important things to be doing then sourcing everybody else 's content for them . 
  every minute we spend looking for sources is a minute where we could be tracking down hate speech or stopping brigading . 
  it would be much simpler , quicker and a more economic use of everybody 's time if the op posted a credible source a long with whatever image content they post . 
    additionally , holocaust denial ( of either the 1915 armenian genocide or the 1941-5 holocaust of the jews , homosexuals , the disabled , jehovah 's witnesses , etc. ), 
  is completely unacceptable . 
   i think you need to learn what the holocaust was ... 
  i think you 're just searching for the term `` genocide '' here . 
  not to be a pest or seem homophobic/whatever , but as far as i know , there has n't been anything that could be described as a genocide of homosexuals , the disabled , or jehovah 's witnesses in recent history . 
  plsnoban the holocaust of jews , homosexuals , the disabled and jehovah 's witnesses , etc was all the same genocide . 
  it 's only those two genocides that we ban for . 
    it is not ok to make pejorative statements about large cultural , national or ethnic groups especially when these groups are not entered into by choice ( e.g. 
  race , gender , sexuality ) . 
   what does `` entered into by choice '' mean in this context ? 
  you can hate somebody for making stupid decisions . 
  you ca n't hate them for ` what ' they are ( e.g. 
  their sexuality or race ) . 
  you 're born with a sexuality and a race . 
  you had no choice in the matter . 
  if you choose to join manchester football club , then you deserve every ounce of criticism you get . 
   ( i think you can probably generalize that entire section of bannable offenses to not being a dick . ), 
  essentially , yes . 
  only it 's `` do n't be * massive * dick '' . 
  but we wanted to specify exactly what being a massive dick means and we decided that this was a pretty conclusive list . 
  if you do something not mentione here , then i ca n't see any legitimate reason why the mods should take action . 
  i do n't know of any simple way to make the mod logs visible to the users . 
  we could invest a lot of time and energy in developing a way , but the mod team is very over stretched as it is ( it took us two weeks just to draft this rule update ) . 
  so it 's unlikely we 'll be able to do that in the near future , sorry . 
  as for giving explanations , we do . 
  everytime i remove something i leave a comment explaining that the psot has been removed and which rules have been breached . 
  however , if i left another post in its place with a big ` sorry removed for rule 1.1 ' sign and linking to the original post , it would rather defeat the point if removing it in the first place . 
  i mean specifically these two genocides because these two specifically have an overwhelming amount of evidence to support them and because holocaust denial in these two cases is only ever used to justify xenophobia and racial hatred . 
  they 're also two of the only genocides that you are actually legally forbiden from denying in several european countries . 
  if it 's in the comments section , then it 's fine . 
  all of the `` removal '' rules only really apply to submissions . 
  what happens in the comments section is fair game , so long as nobody starts advocading the mass murder of refugees , or other ** seriously ** xenophobic nonsense . 
  depends exactly which european country and how hard the language would be to learn . 
  with spain , i 'd be pretty happy because i 'm practically native , given that i can order a beer and a cup of coffee sin leche , in spanish . 
  with italy i 'd be ok . 
  i 've never had any burning desire to move to italy , but i would n't complain if i was there . 
  i probably would n't stay for more than a year or two though . 
  greece is similar , only the language is much , much harder . 
  with all these three it would n't be so bad because the weather and food basically makes up for all of the down sides . 
  russia is the only other ` other side of europe ' which is n't in the deep south though . 
  i 've got to admit . 
  i 'd be terrified , but i 'd also be intrigued . 
  so long as i could live in moscow or saint petersburg and i was well paid , i think i 'd like it . 
  so long as nobody finds out i 'm bisexual . 
  what about scotland or ireland , though ? 
  they 're the furthest eu country from cyprus , and much less ... isolated than iceland . 
  this has been removed, 
  i 've done a bit of digging through these and it turns out the information actually comes from twitter via the director of human rigths watch , who has a verified twitter account . 
  given all that , we can allow it . 
  surprisingly this is one of the first times i 've seen oc that is actually sourced properly ( even if it was still quite difficult to get at it ) . 
  if you got this from wikipedia ( which i 'm about 99 % certain you did , based on the style of map ) then there should be little numbers in brackets which correspond to a source at the bottom of the page . 
  like this  / u/slyratchet is amazingly and good looking ^ [ [ 1 ] ( http://www.somethingsomethingsomething.com ) ] ^ [ [ 2 ] ( http://www.durpdurpdadwd.com ) ] . 
   [ 1 ] www.insertcrediblesourcehere.com  [ 2 ] some random book ; the sequel by ratchet , sly find the thing at the bottom , if it is credible , link to that . 
   ... \u00e9coliers ... children i think you mean * pupils * . 
  please provide a source . 
  this is useful information that people should see but i ca n't allow it here without a source . 
  you ca n't use a self post for this . 
  please post the individual submissions directly . 
  most importantest is biceps . 
  swag . 
  those are just the people you talk to . 
  there 's likely people reading your comments ( and the comments of the supposedly misinformed that you are arguing against ) who are being influenced one way or the other , who you will never know exist . 
  of course the commission is not going to accept criticism on the fundamental tenet of the treaty . 
  that would be like hitler saying that actually race does n't matter . 
  the treat writing stage is not the part of the agreement where you decide if the vision is good or not . 
  the writing stage is where you decide the specifics . 
  hopefully we would have already agreed if regulatory coherence was a good idea or not by virtue of the fact that we elected the people who are now writing the treaty . 
  when we electe juncker to be the leader of the commission , we knew this is the sort of thing we 'd be getting . 
  and in the instance that by the time the treaty has actually been written , public opinion has changed , there is a second opportunity for the fundamental tenet of the treaty to be rejected , by having the european parliament reject the treaty . 
  so there is ample opportunity for the fundamentals of any treaty or idea to be rejected ( either at an election or at the treaty ratification stage ) , it 's just not going to happen for a while because they actually have to finish the thing first . 
  that 's bloody amazing . 
  they 're literally making a walking dome , a dome that is big enouh to encompasse an already enermous structure beneath it . 
  this is one of the coolest things i 've seen in a long time . 
  also , how this is being funded . 
  i 'm amazed ukraine has the resources to do this , given all the other stresses at this time . 
  there must be some exteranl help involved . 
  checks out . 
  so we should reject all the treaties on the creation of the [ united nations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_charter ) , the [ european union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaties_of_the_european_union ) , the [ treaty against the proliferation of nuclear weapons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_non-proliferation_of_nuclear_weapons ) , the [ treaty which virtually banned chemical weapons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemical_weapons_convention ) anywhere on earth , or the various [ environmental treaties like kyoto ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyoto_protocol ) ? 
  all treaties are made behind closed doors ( which is , as far as i 'm aware , the anti-democratic element you 're talking about ) and then ratified by elected assemblies like any ordinary piece of legislation . 
  i do n't see why the democratic argument really holds water with ttip but no other major treaty . 
  let 's criticise ttip because of its content , not because of some hypocritical attack on how the treaty is constructed . 
  you 're trying to misrepresent what i said . 
  i never said that moderators should say where on the frontpage particular submissions should be placed . 
  moderators should only ensure that lowest common denominator content is removed . 
  however , you 're trying to insinuate not only that i said moderators should decide where things are placed ( which i did n't say ) but also that i think this principle should be applied to the comments section . 
  deciding * where * things go is entirely up to the users . 
  however , i do believe moderators have a role in removing some comments too . 
  we 're * much * more liberal in the comments section . 
  you can post as much unsourced stuff in the comments section as you want .
