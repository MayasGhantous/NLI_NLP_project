  the passivhaus requires essentially zero energy to heat , because it retains all of the heat and generates heat from the humans inside them . 
  likewise , a lot of the eu policies which cap the amount of electricity that appliances like hoovers and lightbulbs can use have actually been really good at reducing overall energy consumption without reducing quality ( hoovers have actually gotten a lot better , because producers are now focused on creating the most effective hoover instead of the one with the biggest number on the side of the box ) . 
  it 's all about increasing efficiency . 
  that said , this will get us a lot of the way , but at the end of the day some hard decisions will still need to be made about how our energy is produced and how what we use it on . 
  right wingers in the labour party tend to be far more liberal than socialist . 
  socialism has sort of adopted the values of democracy over time ( it originally preferred revolution ) where as liberalism has held democracy as a fundamental value since its inception hundreds of years ago . 
  at least that 's the only obvious answer i can fathom . 
  it 's possible there are other reasons ( such as trying to show that they are ideologically distinct from the current leader ) . 
   i actually have exactly this stance on direct democracy . 
  still better than advocating for an ` unfair ' parliamentary democracy i guess ? 
  knowing you ( as we 've spoken about stuff like this before ) i actually do n't think you 're doing your own position justice . 
  i think one of the two issues with direct democracy is that most people just do n't care about the minutia of daily governance . 
  like , what 's your policy on business rate tax in manchester ? 
  do you think we should redraw the council tax bands in bristol ? 
  should britain build a new road between sheffield and leeds ? 
  if yes , how ? 
  if you have representative democracy ( as exists in most western european countries ) then you just vote people in and they fill in the blanks according to a guiding vision of society and government . 
  the people should always have the power to make decisions on the things that matter , but it 's also worth acknowledging that not everyone can have knowledge and opinions on every area of governance . 
  ( the other argument is simply that it leads to disjointed policy , as seen in the usa because they hold elections every two years , leaving no time for the actual business of governance ) . 
   actually it is questionable whether we actually need a treshold at this point in time . 
  germany ( as well as the uk ) is a mature democracy . 
  we did not have a treshold in the last eu election and it resulted in 7 seats ( out of 95 ) going to parties that are not ` mainstream ' . 
  it still threatens stability a little bit ( since forming coalitions becomes harder ) , but i think we are at a point where we could take that . 
  i do n't have a problem with the current hurdle however . 
  the thing is , i think germany ( and the uk ) are stable * because * of their systems . 
  most parties do n't form in the first place because they know they 'll never make the 5 % hurdle so just focus on supporting other pre-existing parties or building pressure groups . 
  if you dropped the 5 % suddenly new parties would spring up and become popular and suddenly * weimar republic 2.0 * !, 
  that 's just my theory though . 
  i do n't have any case studies of a country switching from fptp to pr . 
  did new zealand do that ? 
  i know that generally new forms of democracy have been implemented * within * the uk over time , such as the london assembly ( which features a double ballot , the same way the french president is elected ) and the scottish parliament , which has mixed system , with half the seats being constituency seats ( as under the westminster system ) and the other half being complete pr seats . 
  i think that these systems have aided the rise of third parties , such as the scottish national party in scotland , plaid cymru in wales and even rising support for parties like the lib dems and greens in london ( where they 're both polling above their national averages ) . 
  it 's hardly that challenging . 
  the german and french languages manage to effectively change the language every few years without much difficulty . 
  just look at the [ german spelling reform of 1996 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_orthography_reform_of_1996 ) . 
  if we can change the language this easily , and significantly improve at least some people 's lives ( either because they genuinely are transgender by birth or by eroding sexism ) why would you not support it ? 
  it 's not like it 's hurting you . 
  also worth noting is that the reason non-british people ( like the bertelsmann charity which made this image ) usually use the house of lords instead of the house of commons is because the hol is * technically * the ` upper ' chamber whilst the hoc is technically the ` lower ' chamber . 
  and you have to admit , the hol is * much * more grand . 
  the queen gives a speech from it every year and it has its own throne !, 
  it shows a lot about the history of our democracy , really . 
  you can see how very traditionally the landed aristocracy ( i.e. 
  lords ) were the much more powerful group in the country , whilst the common folk were far weaker ( and as such , the house of commons is far less luxurious than the house of lords ) . 
  but over time we have gradually shifted the two chambers so that now the hoc is by far the more powerful chamber . 
  the hol only has the power to delay legislation for one year , after which the hoc can simply choose to override it . 
  and the hol is n't even allowed to vote * at all * on bills which relate to taxes and money . 
  so it 's an incredibly weak legislation body . 
  but despite all of this , the pomp , ceremony and tradition still say that the house of lords is the more important of the two . 
  that 's just what happens when you deal with a one thousand year old country , i guess !, 
   agreed , my friend says fptp is a good thing because it keeps governments strong if you want a good argument against that , just point out that pr and strong government are n't mutually exclusive . 
  you can easily fix the problem of instability ( such as seen in brazil , israel and the german weimar republic of 1920s ) by creating a minimum threshold . 
  for instance , in germany today there is a 5 % threshold . 
  that means that a party must get at least 5 % of the vote nationally to get any seats in parliament . 
  and look how strong germany is !, 
  they 're the powerhouse of the eu and their chancellor is the most powerful women in the world . 
   keeps parties like ukip out then just call him a hypocrite who only likes democracy because it creates results that he agrees with . 
  democracy is about the rule of the people , whether you agree with them or not . 
  if you are willing to not support democracy simply because you dislike what the public would choose , then you 're no better than a king in an ivory tower , believing they know best . 
  that 's the official party line , but if you look at things like the private members bill on electoral reform which failed a few weeks/months , you can see a lot of labour figures supporting it : people like tristram hunt and chuka umunna . 
  if the right wing of the labour party is supporting policies like this , then it shows you it 's a divisive issue within the party . 
  you can always vote for a party which actually puts these values at its core , like the greens or lib dems . 
  labour only tack on policies like pr to for election purposes , whilst the smaller parties support them on a fundamental level . 
  the snp are definitely okay with it . 
  they 're vocally pushing for pr and have been doing both before their landslide westminster victory and afterwards . 
  there 's also a huge number of labour party mps who are pro-electoral reform . 
  there was a private members bill on voting reform which failed recently , but had a lot of right wing labour mps voting for it . 
  so if labour is on the fence about it , that leaves only the ruling conservatives , with 37 % of the vote who oppose it . 
  i think that counts as growing traction . 
  to be fair to the imf , they 've been saying that austerity is n't the answer for years now . 
  they believed in austerity at the beginning of the crisis , but they changed their minds when they saw that it was n't working . 
  we can dream :( [ it 's certainly gaining traction ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/electoral-reform-labour-snp-ukip-and-lib-dems-to-campaign-for-proportional-representation-a6859711.html ), 
  would you be able to provide more context to that particular statement ? 
  i only skim read the headline . 
  i know i should n't just read headlines , but sometimes it 's hard not to . 
  well i think you 're actually touching on some of the ` more complex ' reasons that i was talking about . 
  i mean , you 'll notice that i did very explicitly say that there is a link with islam here . 
  it 's a very good point ; why are turkish apparently less keen on terrorist acts as those from other countries ? 
  i very , * very * strongly disagree with you that it has anything to do with turkey 's supposed secularism . 
  i think what it has more to do with as , yes , poverty ( if you 're well educated and happy , then you 're not gon na blow yourself up ) but also ( and possibly more importantly ) wahhabi islam . 
  what 's important about [ wahhabi islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabism ) is that it is a subsect of * of a sub sect * of islam . 
  that is , there are two main branches of islam , ** shia ** ( the one which focuses more on interpretation by clerics , practiced in iran and iraq ) and ** sunni ** ( which generally focuses on a mixture of clerical interpretation and following the koran verbatim , practiced in most other islamic countries ) . 
  , and of wahhabism is just one small branch of sunni islam . 
  ( [ here 's a population map of the two main muslim sects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sunni_islam#/media/file:islam_by_country.png ) ) . 
  within this , the wahhabi 's are estimated to account for 0.5 % of the global muslims population . 
  but what 's important to note is that wahhabi islam is also very rich , because it is the sect followed by the saudi arabian royal family . 
  as part of this , the saudi arabians fund wahhabi mosques all over the world , including in europe , which provides a network for radicalisation and for connecting radicalised muslims to terrorist networks . 
  also interesting , is that osama bin laden was actually a saudi citizen , with saudi support up until 9/11 ( when the publicly backed off ) . 
  so to sum up , what i 'm saying is that the reasons for radicalisation and ultimately for the perpetration of terrorist acts is a mixture of social exclusion , * religion * and finance . 
  -- the question then becomes one about how we solve it . 
  personally , i think that any solution we have is gon na include weakening saudi arabia , and we can start that by stopping importing their oil and by stopping supporting them in the region . 
  a lot of our problems of radicalisation would never have occurred if we had never supported them . 
  and i think any solution is gon na require stopping it * long term * which means it cutting it off at source : which is saudi arabia . 
  what , and mass spread discrimination against an ethnic and religious group is n't also a serious issue ? 
  i think that everyone here acknowledges that terrorism is awful . 
  we absolutely must solve it . 
  the question is solving it in a way which does not cause more problems . 
  we can not give up our fundamental values of equality , non-discrimination , tolerance and freedom . 
  but many of the solutions that you see aired ( `` ban muslims '' - trump ) do violate those fundamental values . 
  that 's really superficial though . 
  the real answer is much more complicated if you look at the individual instances , the overwhelming majority happened in the middle east , which is generally incredibly unstable .
