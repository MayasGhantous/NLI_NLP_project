  the jihadism springs from the fact the region is majority muslim and hugely unstable . 
  if you do n't believe me , take for example indonesia , the world 's largest muslim country . 
  it is ( comparatively ) stable , muslim and lacks the entrenched terrorist attacks . 
  -- i 'm not saying you 're wrong to include religion as a factor . 
  i think religion is a factor ( wahhabi islam , specifically ) . 
  but i think that just pointing at islam and saying that 's the problem is too simplistic . 
  the real cause is included islam but also includes many other factors . 
  we need to acknowledge that the cause of terrorism are not simple . 
  they 're complex . 
  and until we acknowledge the complexity of the problem , we 're never going to be able to come up with a solution . 
  i think the main thing is this false dichotomy between having a free society and a society free of terrorist incidents . 
  like , i do n't think that it * is * a choice between those two . 
  erdogan 's turkey shows us that . 
  he recently gave a statement saying that ` democracy and liberty ' ( or something a long those lines ) have no place in turkey . 
  has that stopped the terrorist attacks in turkey ? 
  no it has n't !, 
  it 's not a question about liberty verses security . 
  curteiling our liberty * does not help fight terrorists * . 
  we 've seen this again and again . 
  the answer to the solution is far more complex . 
  anyone can spot a problem . 
  even someone as stupid as erdogan . 
  but finding a solution ? 
  that 's far harder . 
   few serious people do lol . 
  i do n't take them seriously , but if you stick around here you 'll see a lot of people who say that and are serious about it . 
  you can dis on the guardian , and you should . 
  it 's got problems . 
  but there 's a difference between guardian bad and daily mail , a newspaper which ** literally supported hitler ** and has n't changed since . 
  that 's just about the worst newspaper in the uk . 
  it 's genuinely worse than the daily mail . 
  great . 
  if you could source that then it 's interesting . 
  if not , then it 's just conjecture . 
  there are about 8 million estimated syrian refugees + many millions more from different countries . 
  have some complained about countries like finland and germany ? 
  almost certainly yes . 
  why ? 
  because there 's fucking millions of them and of course if you have that many some of them are gon na say stupid things . 
  are these people representative of all refugees ? 
  yeah . 
  you know why they would say that ? 
  because brexit is bad for business . 
  you know how we know that . 
  because the confederation of british industry say so . 
  that 's interesting . 
  do you have a link ? 
  i think what i quite like about andrew marr is that he let 's the politicians say what they want to say , rather than trying to ask pointed questions . 
  we have a lot of interviewers like that ( channel four , news night ) but andrew marr is the only one who will let politicians say what they want to say and that 's valuable . 
  it 's like , you turn on the tv and you get a glimpse into the world as this ( usually quite hated ) political figure gets a chance to air their world view . 
  it makes a change from most interviewers who are trying to get the politician to admit to something , rather than hearing them out . 
  you have the heute show ? 
  is n't that vaguely similar ( although more `` comedic '' ) ? 
  the thing is , whilst most uk people agree with that , they also agree that in similar or larger numbers that british nationals should * not * be limited from visiting eu countries and should have the right to work in eu countries . 
  so basically , when you remind them that our access to the eu is contingent on the rest of the eu having access here , they usually come out in favour of the eu . 
  it 's like saying , `` i do n't like paying for what i pay . '', 
  of course i would rather have it for free . 
  but at the end of the day , the stuff is good so i pay for it . 
  -- ^ ( although this all has the assumption that immigration to the uk is not hugely beneficial to us , which it is . 
  we gain far more from accepting immigrants from western and eastern europe , with only limited problems . 
  the problems which it does cause can be easily solved through the proper administration of social welfare so that those who are priced out of the job market can still maintain a decent standard of living . 
  it 's really better for everyone if we allow european immigration in both directions . 
  it 's better for the migrants as well as the nations involved . ), 
  it 's shifted recently , though . 
  people do n't hate poles so much anymore . 
  that 's why there was the all out offensive by ukip to demonise romanians . 
  there 's too few of them for most british people to ever meet or know anything about , which makes it easier to scapegoat them . 
  bear in mind bochum is probably the region of germany i spent the longest in , and i 'm speaking about it in comparison to sheffield . 
  the other germanic cities i 've visited are : * berlin ( 1 week ) * fu\u00dfnach , vorarlberg , austria + lots of day trips to nearby places like lindau , liechtenstein and nearby swiss countryside ( 1 week ) * munich + day trips to salzburg and schloss neuschwanstein ( 4 or 5 days ) * day trips to dortmund and k\u00f6ln whilst in bochum ( less than a day each ) . 
  i think what really impressed me about bochum is that it * should * be shit . 
  i mean , it 's in an over populated , ( ex ) industrial area and it 's the [ poorest west german state apart from the city state of bremen ] ( https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/infografik_2861_armutsgefaehrdungsquote_pro_bundesland_n.jpg ) . 
  and what 's more , it 's a * tiny * city . 
  it 's got about 350,000 people , whilst yorkshire cities of comparative size include [ rotherham ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham ) , which is famous for the [ rampant child sex exploitation ] ( http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/rotherham-abuse-trial-council-staff-threatened-to-take-children-off-woman-for-speaking-out-about-abuse-1-7682486 ) and is just generally a shit hole . 
  like , no joke about it being a shit hole . 
  living conditions are worse than in many eastern european countries . 
  these are the sorts of people that have led to the rise of ukip ; left behind by society . 
  but bochum occupies a similar place in germany as rotherham does in the uk . 
  but bochum is just a fine place to live . 
  it 's not an * amazing * place to live , but it 's not bad . 
  it 's a bit small , but it 's also got everything that you need . 
  and the transport system is amazing . 
  the transport system is better than basically any british city outside of london , because london is the only british city with a real underground system ( okay , newcastle and glasgow do have an underground system , but they only have [ one track ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glasgow_subway#/media/file:glasgow_spt_subway_map.svg ) whilst [ bochum 's is extensive ] ( http://mapa-metro.com/mapas/bochum/mapa-metro-bochum.png ) ) . 
  -- as for other german cities : they 're certainly more impressive than bochum , both in terms of the scale , businesses and history . 
  i really love the k\u00f6lner dom and the boulevards in munich are more impressive than just about any other european city that i 've seen . 
  the way berlin has embraced its recent past though , and incorporated it into the design of the city is amazing . 
  the line which goes all the way through the city marking where the wall used to be is innovative and remind you of what happened . 
  although the [ stolpersteine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stolperstein ) are obviously great at that too . 
  and seeing as i mentioned stolpersteine , the [ holocaust memorial ] ( http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/holocaust-memorial-in-berlin-bert-paredes.jpg ) in berlin is also impressive and is one of the best works of art that i know of . 
  but again , i think that bochum offers something that these other cities do n't . 
  these other cities are huge , and great . 
  where as i think there 's also something nice about the smaller cities being liveable and tolerable . 
  in the uk , the small cities are quite often shells of their former selves and only the big 6 metropolises are worth living in , and even then you really need to live in london if you want to be successful . 
  in germany , it felt like even the small cities got their fair share . 
  and even the small cities were nice places that an average person could live a good life . 
  greenland is generally a very strange place . 
  their prison system is the most open in the world , at least that i 've ever heard of  today , greenland does have a couple of prisons , but outsiders would be hard pressed to recognize any similarities with the prison system most of us are familiar with . 
  they are `` open '' prisons - in that they are detention centres where committed offenders are locked up only between the hours of 9.30 pm and 6.30 am . 
   outside of those hours , prisoners are allowed to wander freely around town , hold down paying jobs , visit their families , before perhaps going to the video rental store to pick up a movie or two to pass the evening hours inside . 
   e commission is an executive body , the president is the most powerful person in brussels . 
  he can be hold responsible for every important legislation , or even things such as lack of initiative to tackle migrant crisis .
