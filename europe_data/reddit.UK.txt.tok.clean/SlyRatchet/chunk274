  ( again , i talk way more about sovereignty on the main subreddit ) the point about eu immigration is just blame wrong . 
  eu migrants claim less welfar than british residents . 
  they contribute way more in taxes than they take . 
  they provide us with services they would n't otherwise have or the same services at lower costs . 
  if you want to talk about extra-eu immigration like somalis and pakistanis then that 's a different issue entirely . 
  but eu immigration is hugely beneficial to the uk . 
  it would be ridiculous to support brexit based on eu immigration . 
  1 ) provided link in original comment . 
  2 ) it 's stupid that we 're forcing them to make that choice . 
  we 're playing politics with people 's lives . 
  3 ) would you care to expand further ? 
  i can hardly explain why any other pro-brexit pov is bs if you give me so little to dig into . 
  two things 1 ) the figure is actually [ 2 million ] ( https://euobserver.com/social/123066 ) or about 3.3 % of the uk population . 
  that 's pretty significant given what 's at stake . 
  for those that will be able to stay they will no longer be able to apply for jobs on the same basis as national citizens ( ie the state can discriminate against us in favour of their own citizens ) , and they will no longer have access to in work benefits , or free healthcare . 
  2 ) * some * will be able to get local citizenship , but many eu states do not allow dual citizenships at all , so if a british expat is fortunate enough to be eligible for eu citizenship in their local country , they may still have to give up their british citizenship in order to stay in their adoptive country . 
  i think that 's absurd . 
  we 're playing politics with people 's lives so that we can fulfil some strange idea of sovereignty ( which i talk more about in my comment on / r/incampaign ) . 
  no one 's saying that . 
  no one is saying that there will be no trade . 
  they 're saying that there will be much * less * trade . 
  if you wan na make a witty retort , at least make it relevant . 
  the gif has been posted around a lot of pro-in websites in the uk already . 
  it 's not meant to disparage the uk , but simply help convince people that the eu is good for britain . 
  of course , if you want to construe it as an insult , then you can , but that does n't mean it is one . 
  i thought the point about kruschev 's speech was interesting ( penultimate/second to last point ) . 
  he had fully achieved his transition as head of the ussr just a few months previously in 1955 . 
  it 's interesting that he was so quick to denounce stalin . 
  dispansion of warsaw pact is also interesting . 
   if germany so badly want their refugee darlings they should be taking them from greece after helping process them . 
  but that 's literally what germany is trying to do ... 
  the suspension of the dublin ii agreement was to help alleviate pressure on greece and the refugee relocation policy which is being worked on is designed to fulfil that as well . 
  also , the eu has offered greece additional border agents under a frontex banner . 
  i do n't get why you 're so angry with germany . 
  they 're doing everything you 've said you want them to do and more . 
  edit : completely unrelated , but are n't you one of the subreddit old timers ? 
  i swear i recognise your name from a mod application years ago . 
  it was described by a politico.eu journalist ( james paninchi iirc ) as being dominated by right wingers at the top , but dominated by young left wingers at the grassroots . 
  that 's not been a problem in the past , but is now because the five star movement is finally starting to get control of some places , like mayorships of some cities , and they have to create distinctive policies . 
  cheater !, 
  great . 
  now you know what it 's like being anti-immigration in western europe . 
  i do n't know what the posters above are talking about . 
  i know a lot of anti-refugee people , even though i live in one of the most left wing parts of the my country , and they do n't get ostracised either . 
  this hypothetical ` you ca n't be anti immigration or life is ruined ' meme needs to die . 
  yeah i can live with that characterisation . 
  i just get annoyed when people say ` it 's the eu 's fault ' as if the eu is somehow out there deliberately plotting to make greece go into recession . 
  it just speaks to the general misunderstanding and scape goating of the eu . 
  there are certainly systematic problems . 
  but they are problems that the eu and its member states are trying to solve . 
  who 'd have thought that finding compromise on 28 independent countries about issues with trillions of euros would be so difficult ? 
  i agree . . 
  it 's a systemic problem with the euro which prevents devaluing of the currency . 
  but it 's not like the eu is actively forcing them to keep the euro . 
  it 's something that the greek people have voted on in a referendum to maintain membership of . 
  the greek people want to remain members of the eu and user the euro currency . 
  the eu itself is n't forcing this austerity on greece . 
  in fact , living standards are still far higher for greeks than before they joined the eu . 
  what do you expect the eu to do ? 
  i swear , everyone blames the eu for this , but i never hear any constructive reason why they are to blame . 
   sanctions are pointless when there are other markets ready to fill the gap that 's just blatantly untrue . 
  you 're ignoring economics 101 . 
  the price of a given item is determined by the supply plus the demand . 
  if you reduce the supply of weapons available to saudi arabia then the price they must pay for weapons goes up , meaning that they can afford * less * weapons overall . 
  so sanctions do have an effect , even when there are other markets available . 
  so what does the labour law actually do ? 
  if you treat the `` far left '' and `` far right '' as homogeneous groups with no diversity within them than ... yeah i guess you 're sort of right . 
  it 's just that the `` far left '' and `` far right '' are n't one group . 
  i mean , in the eu parliament the far right are split off into three or more separate groups , and the far left includes things like socialists , social democrats ( like bernie sanders ) , marxists ( who do n't vote in elections all ) , feminists , environmentalists , and even progressive liberals and occasionally one nation conservatives . 
  all of these groups are often distrustful or outright hostile towards each other and have wildly different points of view on things ( including free speech ) . 
  to characterise them as one group is ... silly . 
  you 're aware that most refugees , especially syrians , actually integrate really well ? 
  the refugees which integrate badly tend to come from north africa , the overwhelming majority of which will be denied asylum anyway . 
  the ones who have trouble integrating tend to be economic migrants , who will be deported , whilst the majority who integrate well are legitimate refugees with valid asylum claims . 
  yes and no . 
  the law is a changeable thing . 
  [ as you can see here ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/how-easy-is-it-to-deport-refugees-out-of-germany/a-18966170 ) . 
   none of the perpetrators of the mass sexual assaults and thefts that took place in cologne on new year 's eve have yet been identified , but ** german politicians are responding ** to the eyewitness reports that the perpetrators were of arab or north african appearance ** with proposals to make it easier to deport ** asylum seekers and ** refugees ** who commit crimes . 
  there are already instances where refugees can get deported anyway , without a change in the law . 
  the change in the law would just expedite the process and make sure it is more widely applicable . 
  yes and no . 
  people often say that the schengen free movement zone/no internal borders zone is a barrier to a refugee relocation scheme , because it allows refugees to move from one country to another without the authorities noticing . 
  this is n't really accurate . 
  schengen is not a barrier . 
  it can simply be stated in the refugee 's asylum contract that the conditions for their safe asylum is residence at a particular address . 
  if they move to a different eu country and the authorities find out ( which they will , because the authorities make regular at home check ups ) then their asylum contract can be voided and they will be deported . 
  this all exists currently , despite the existence of the schengen zone . 
  ergo , schengen is not an obstacle to an effective refugee relocation scheme . 
  -- the real problem is , that under the way eu rules work at the moment , refugees ( and i do mean refugees , that is , asylum seekers who 's claim has been verified ) have to specifically state that they want to be re-located to country x , otherwise they ca n't legally be made to move . 
  it 's not surprising that when they 're being asked specifically which country they want to be located in , most of them happen to say the same few countries . 
  what the eu is currently trying to achieve at the summit of the 28 national leaders in 18th to the 20th ( and i believe there is another summit coming up in may as well where this will be further discussed if no binding agreement is made this february ) is to make a forceable relocation scheme , where the member states decide which country the refugees will go to according to a pre-established fair formula . 
  the only real obstacle to a refugee relocation scheme is the legal ability to forcibly relocate refugees once they are inside the eu and coming up with a fair criteria for refugee distribution across the eu , both of which should be sorted at the summit on 18th-20th of february . 
  what your said is either misleading or outright incorrect . 
  1 ) the right to be forgotten does not apply when the information is considered to be highly relevant , e.g. 
  if you are a public figure or have a history of crime ( eg paedphilia ) . 
  2 ) your employer * does * care . 
  i know someone who was fired from being a teacher because they had a publicly viewable facebook account of them holing an empty plastic cup ( which would ordinarily be used for alcohol ) . 
  employers care . 
  the right to be forgotten matters on this regard . 
  3 ) `` normal people have got nothing to hide '' is a ducking stupid excuse .
