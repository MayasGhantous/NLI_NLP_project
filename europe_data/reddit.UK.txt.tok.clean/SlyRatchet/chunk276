  what 's more important : that a company should be able to have one guy burning fossil fuels at a rate so high i ca n't even find an analogy , or there being a stable planet in the next 50 to 100 years ? 
  we are going to ** have to ** pay the price at some point . 
  and it only gets more expensive the longer we out it off . 
  so , what do you prefer ? 
  are you saying that cows and volcanoes are the things driving this unprecedented rise in global warming and climate change , rather than people ? ... 
  also , natural gas is only a profile ** when human beings burn them ** for energy . 
  it may be called natural gas , but it is n't naturally a problem for the environment, 
   i would n't vote for it because it does n't sound like a very functional system at all , and it 'll probably make air travel much more difficult and expensive and generally mess up the whole system . 
  i agree that it 'll make air travel much more difficult . 
  that 's kind of * the point * . 
  if you do n't warn us to cut down in air travel consumption , how do you propose we cut down our carbon emissions to sustainable levels ? 
  in the end , even a bad government ca n't ignore the public when there 's a clear and strong opinion in one direction . 
  we do have the power to change things . 
  that 's why countries like denmark produce the majority of their electricity from renewable resources !, 
  is your problem purely to do with it being undemocratic , or would you vote for the idea if it was put to you in an election, 
  oh yeah sure . 
  let 's help all the refugees but keep them in raqqa , the isis capital . 
  i 'm sure we can help them there . 
  i 'm not deciding it for other people . 
  i 'm saying we should all come together democratically and decide to do this . 
  we need to come together as a society and as a planet and set the necessary limits on our own consumption . 
  otherwise , we 're all just turkeys voting for christmas . 
  my point was n't that it does not impair travel at all . 
  it certainly makes one type of travel * more difficult * . 
  my point is that it allows you the maximum amount of mobility whilst still being sustainable . 
  and it also does not cut off travel if you reall need it . 
  if you need to travel to australia to visit your dying grandmother , then you can still fork up the money . 
  it discourages air travel . 
  it does not stop it . 
  i 'm sorry , but it 's just impossible to make planes efficient enough to use at the level we currently are that us environmentally sustainable . 
  anyway , you can always have systems alongside this ( such as company tax deductions , rebates , grants ) which do factor in efficiency . 
  it does n't prohibit travel . 
  it actually specifically allows travel . 
  just not using excessively carbon intensive resources excessively frequently . 
  you can still use air travel . 
  just not all the time . 
  and even then , there 's other ways to travel besides planes , which are way more environmentally friendly . 
   you can say it 's not sustainable but the world economy literally relies on it . 
  we seemed fine before mass air travel . 
  pretty sure the world wo n't end afterwards either . 
  saying the world economy relies on it is a but feeble . 
   also i 'm sure we can find other ways to `` save the planet '' without destroying the airline industry such as ? 
  i would say that we need to introduce thus measure plus a lot more ( passivhaus insulation standards as mandatory , for instance as well as import tariffs based on environmental pollution ) . 
   and our own economies . 
  it would n't destroy the economy . 
  the economy managed fine before the days of mass consumption . 
  it will survive afterwards . 
  the economy exists to serve the people not the other way around, 
  dude , you 're corrections are rubbish and often contradict each other . 
  you 're saying that the eu only existed for 24 years which you * know * is bullshit . 
  the eu has existed for around 60 years and developed over time . 
  24 years ago was just when it got * named * the eu ( formerly it was the european community ) . 
  but then later you say that it only started fucking up when it added the social policies ... but the social policies were added in around the same time it was renamed , and often beforehand !, 
  so how could the eu start to fail when it did n't even exist ? 
  and nafta is a stupid counter too . 
  that 's just a free trade area , like ttip or the efta or tpp . 
  does nafta have its own parliament , elected by the citizens ? 
  that means it 's also a bs example . 
  come back to me when you want to talk substance instead of quips . 
  i said already in a different comment that illegals should be deported . 
  eu member states should have the balls to process migrants and depression the illegals whilst helping the legitimate refugees . 
  then their companies can employ different people around europe to do that job without pumping up such high emissions . 
  or , they could travel using carbon friendly methods . 
  yeah , this will probably cost the company more . 
  sorry , but if saving the planet impairs your ability to do business then that 's too bad for you . 
  good . 
  you should n't be able to fly five times in a week . 
  i 'm sorry , but that sort of thing just is n't sustainable . 
  we 're gon na have to come clean sooner or later about what is necessary to avert catastrophic climate change , and the sooner we do , the fewer sacrifices will need to be made . 
  sorry , but we all live on the same planet . 
  every thing is interconnected . 
  some guy pumping c02 into the air is directly hurting ever gone else on the planet . 
  you call it nanny statism . 
  i call it fairness . 
  i call it common sense . 
  it allows us to largely continue with our current standards living today whilst also ** saving the planet ** . 
  if you 're problem is that it interferes between people 's market freedom 's , then sorry , but in a fight between the planet and the free market then the planet wins every time . 
  you 're aware that the eu has existed for some 60 years now ? 
  it 's been a pretty huge success , too . 
  largest economy on the planet , including countries with the highest standards of living in the world , all thanks to our fantastic synthesis of the common market and labour mobility and worker and human rights legislation . 
  i 'd call it a huge success , even including today 's crisis . 
  yes it is . 
  if each country took its fair share then syria could become empty and there would hardly be a noticeable difference in the eu population ( because syria small ; eu big ) . 
  then , send back the economic migrants ( the ones who cause all the problems , such as in cologne ) and you 're done . 
  greece would no longer be over burdened , we 'd have saved millions of people from death in syria and we can all get on with our lives . 
  also because the migration flown in spain is far smaller, 
    deport the economic migrants back to a country of origin . 
   did n't happen , does n't happen , will not happen . 
  not true . 
  legislation is already in the works in many eu countries . 
  for instance , here 's a link about germany beginning to introduce such legislation http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskcn0v518e, 
  which is why i said they are working on the legal framework . 
  currently , the scheme does not work because refugees have to voluntarily be relocated . 
  currently , they are attempting to amend the rules so that if a refugee is granted asylum anywhere in the eu , then they can be relocated anywhere else within the eu too ( rather than being bound to that specific member state ) . 
  once that is achieved the system will work . 
  there was a really interesting idea to limit excessive air usage that i read about . 
  * progressive * vat . 
  so , you pay a small sum every time you fly , and each additional flight you take per year makes that sum get larger . 
  so your first flight has a vat of | cost | flight # | | -- | -- | | # 1 , | 1 | | then # 2 , | 2 | | then # 4 , | 3 | | then # 8 , | 4 | | # 16 , | 5 | | # 34 , | 6 | | # 68 , | 7 | | # 156 , | 8 | | # 312 , | 9 | | # 624 , | 10 | | # 1248 , | 11 | | # 2496 , | 12 | | # 4992 , | 13 | | # 9984 , | 14 | | # 19968 | 15 | | # 39936 | 16 | | etc. . . | it allows ordinary people to go on a few holidays per year , whilst cutting down on excessive flights by the wealthy to their weekend homes in ibiza or the swiss alps . 
  i mean , by the time you 've had 16 flights per year under this scheme you 're paying almost # 40,000 per flight , so it becomes economically stupid to do so .
