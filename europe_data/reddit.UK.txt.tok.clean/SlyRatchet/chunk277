  it quite neatly allows the entire population a small number of flights ( at an environmentally sustainable rate ) whilst limiting those who are abusing the planet in which we all rely . 
  sheffield ** represent **, 
  there actually is a solution in motion . 
  it 's call the refugee relocation scheme . 
  everyone who tries to stop the relocation scheme coming into force is just inadvertently hurting greece , because that 's where the refugees get trapped . 
  not that you 're being dramatic , or anything . 
  their stereotype is nice and polite ? 
  what ? 
  i thought their stereotype was that they were all rapists !, 
  and neither that stereotype nor yours are true , because stereotypes are seldom if ever true . 
  ca n't greece just choose to deploy them on the aegean borders rather than the macedonian border ? 
  i mean , surely even if it 's a frontex agency , greece still has some control over them and can also expel them later on . 
  seems stupid to reject help like this , especially when there is a relocation scheme in the works at eu level which basically requires more border guards in greece . 
  and still people say a mandatory refugee relocation scheme is a bad idea . 
  we need to * distribute refugees which arrive in eu soul around the eu according to member states ability to support them * provide greece with the resources to process asylum claims to separate the refugees from the purely economic migrants . 
  * deport the economic migrants back to a country of origin . 
  and the eu is already doing this !, 
  the first and last bullets are currently being worked out legally and iirc frontex ( the eu borders agency ) has already started sending more migration officers to greece . 
  on the other hand , i can understand hollande 's desire not to treat all french citizens equally . 
  if you can remove one person 's citizenship , but not others , then not all french citizens are equal . 
  there 's an interesting principle behind it . 
   you guys you mean british people ? 
  pretty sure uk is taking one of the hardest lines against this type of thing in europe ... or do you mean people who want safe spaces ? 
  well , then i do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , because i do n't care about safe spaces or any of that sort of thing . 
  stop trying to push everyone you disagree with into one , homogenous box . 
  not really . 
  we 've brought in people from all around the world before . 
  in the uk [ the indian population has expanded from 30,000 in 1951 to over 1,000,000 today ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_indian#21st_century ) . 
  it led to somebody called enoch powell ( an earlier incarnation of nigel farage ) saying that there would be [ rivers of blood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rivers_of_blood_speech ) . 
  still waiting on that . 
  so far , they seem to have largely integrated and improved the uk pretty well , even providing the us with it 's new [ national dish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tikka_masala ) . 
  i can totally see where you are coming from . 
  those crimes are awful . 
  the thing i find horrible about rape , is the motivations behind it * and * the act itself . 
  like , acid throwing , blinding , mutilation , etc. 
  are all bad , but the motivations behind them are pretty normal . 
  like , we 've all wanted to physical hurt someone at some point . 
  fortunately , most of us are smart and kind enough to calm down and not do that , let alone actually plan to hurt somebody . 
  still , it 's just you plain old desire to hurt someone + a lack of inhibitions which stop ordinary people from hurting someone . 
  now rape ? 
  that 's different . 
  rape is about * pleasure * and sex . 
  for a lot of people , rape is partly about having a human * relationship * or at least human contact . 
  and that 's the crux of the matter for me . 
  it 's the way somebody 's moral compass needs to be so warped that they can actually take pleasure from hurting someone , and from disrespecting their express wishes . 
  so rape is about taking pleasure in other people 's humiliation , and being able to justified it to themselves afterwards . 
  it 's not the not * only * the ** effects ** of the crime which i am taking into account but also the ** motivations ** and justifications behind it , too . 
  that 's what makes rape so bad , in my opinion . 
  because then we all realise how stupid we all are and judge each other for it . 
  it 's worth making the effort to try and be friendly with people even when you despise what they believe . 
  we 're capable of being friends before we know what each of us believe . 
  it 's not like you ca n't be friends after . 
  why ? 
  do you not think rape is one of the absolute worst crimes that an individual can commit ? 
  it is also far better for all of society , including the victim , perpetrator and everyone who is not involved . 
  look at it this way , you can say that `` someone did something bad . 
  therefore , they must be made made to suffer . '', 
  i can * understand * this ( although i do n't necessarily agree ) . 
  the thing is , whilst that person is in prison , they are just rotting away , using up resources ( guards , food , electricity , etc. ), 
  and they are being unproductive ( they 're just sitting there , wasting time ) . 
  what would be better ? 
  you could rehabilitate them so that they * choose * never to commit crimes again . 
  that way , they get out of prison quicker ( using up less resources ) and start taking part in wider society sooner ( therefore contributing to the economy and making us all richer ) . 
  not only that , but if you focus on * rehabilitation * rather than * punishment * then it is far likely that your society will be safer in future . 
  societies which focus on punishment tend to have * very * high re-offending rates . 
  for instance , norway has one of the most rehabilitative systems in europe , and the usa one of the least in the developed world and the uk is somewhere in the middle . 
  [ their recindivism/reo-offending rates also match ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people ) . 
  so , would you rather punish people harshly and then let them out into the community again so that they can rape and murder and steal again ? 
  or take a re-habilitative approach and let somebody out into society who will probably never commit such a crime again . 
  it 's not about the law . 
  it 's about availability . 
  if there 's pepper spray in ever corner shop , then i 'd bet money that the amount of rapists and burglars who have pepper spray would go up . 
  it 's more about availability . 
  you ca n't just walk into a shop and buy pepper spray , and a rapist usually wont make the extra effort because it 's unlikely that a potential target will have it either . 
  i really do n't think it 's a good idea to legalise it . 
  believe me , i do n't like rapists . 
  i think rape is the worst thing you can do bar murdering someone . 
  it 's just that i think if you start allowing * anyone * to buy pepper spray , then all of a sudden every one is in more danger , because now the rapists have pepper spray too . 
  that 's interesting . 
  is there a source available for this ? 
  same reason knives and goods are illegal . 
  having pepper-spray/goods/knives may make * you * safer , but when everyone has them then * no one * is safer . 
  the best way to combat this is improved policing . 
  surely if we make symbolic gestures about how much we hate daesh , that just further legitimises daesh . 
  i mean , they feed off of our attention . 
  and when western responses to terrorists accidentally draw in innocent muslims ( which will inevitable happen with this law ) the extremists use this further to portray this as a west vs. islam war . 
  we should cut all this symbolic crap and just focus on doing what actually helps . 
  symbolism only helps the terrorists . 
  my thinking is that , if they are stateless , there will constantly be human rights concerns being pressed ( quite rightly ) by the united nations and european court of human rights to ensure that proper protocol is being applied . 
  if they had citizenship ( whether french or otherwise ) this would be less of a problem as the suspect 's home country would fulfil that role ( which is much less hassle , as that 's a bi-lateral rather than multi-lateral or supranational relationship ) . 
  i do n't really see what 's to gain by making people stateless . 
  i mean , if they 're french and a terrorist and france revojes their citizenship , how do you punish them ? 
  much easier to punish them if they are french citizens . 
  i think the point is also that terror legislation can be used against innocent people . 
  in the uk you can be detained for 90 days without trial bein told what you 're tried for . 
  it easily gets civilians caught up and punished for no reason, 
  not an eu member . 
  same reason switzerland , ukraine , belarus , russia and a large part of the balkans do n't have data in this map, 
  my main problem with the way that you 're justifying the samenes ( although i 'm happy we 're not talking about homogeneity ) is that you 're construction artificial ( imo ) groups . 
  like , yes , over half the subreddit is ages 17-25 , but imo that 's not a singular demographic .
