  sure , they 're all young , but people at all of these ages are usually at vastly different stages of development and have vastly different life experiences . 
  for instance , somebody who is 17 is still at school , in many countries that are unable to buy alcohol or cigarettes and in most countries are not allowed to vote . 
  compare that to somebody who is 25 and has likely gone throw university and is now in the employment market or further education , has had the opportunity to vote in several elections , etc. . 
  so , a 17 year old and a 25 year old should not easily be placed into one demographic and called similar . 
  they 're not really that similar . 
  they 're not really a specific group . 
  this is also without even paying attention to the large minority of the subreddit do n't fit into this arbitrary majority group . 
  just because people older than 25 are not in the majority does n't mean they 're not here . 
  they still add to the diversity of the subreddit . 
  anyway , i agree to a certain extent with what you and other users have said . 
  we 're not hugely diverse . 
  the male-female statistic is certainly an example of that . 
  it 's just that i do n't thing the sub is extremely samey or homogenous . 
  there is huge common ground and experience between a large majority of the user base , but also huge diversity as well . 
  it can be both similar and diverse at the same time , and it is . 
  what 's rs mean in this instance ? 
   thus , it is more ... homogeneous yes , it is more homogenous than the real european population . 
  that does n't mean it is homogenous . 
  i am more evil than ghandi and more good than hitler , that does n't mean i am a good or bad person in and of itself . 
  i am more able to run a marathon than a person in a wheelchair . 
  that does not mean i am able to run a marathon . 
  just like this subreddit may be * more * homogenous than something else , but still not be homogenous . 
   of the same kind ; alike : if all jobs and workers were homogeneous . 
   \u2022 consisting of parts all of the same kind are all the users of this subreddit of the same kind ? 
  in fact , in numerous ways , there is not even a majority ( 50 % +1 ) of the same kind , let a lone * all * ( ~ 100 % ) of the same kind . 
  -- also ,  so , yeah -- the majority ( or plurality -- the more precise term ) you ca n't use majority and plurality interchangeably . 
  they 're two different words with very specific meanings . 
  majority means 50 % +1 whilst plurality simply means the largest group amongst other groups . 
  if you 're gon na abuse language in this way ( like you are already doing with the word homogenous ) then there 's just no point . 
  quite right, 
  [ northern ireland is the 8th poorest region in ~ ~ the eu ~ ~ * norther europe * ] ( http://i100.independent.co.uk/image/18477-6rv6cn.jpg ) . 
  also worth noting that south yorkshire is number 5 , and that 's where [ rotherham ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal ) is . 
  edit : eu -  northern europe, 
  as in i am from the uk , but not from northern ireland ( and do n't have any other connection with ireland ) . 
   the majority of users , the way it was broken down , are high school students . 
  i 'm sorry , but which specific data point are you looking at which says that ? 
  -- my point is n't just that you are being harsh . 
  that 's fine . 
  my point is that you are being unreasonably and unfairly harsh . 
  i absolutely acknowledge that this community is not 100 % representative of the european population . 
  in fact , i said that in my previous comment . 
  look :  it 's not 100 % representative of the true population the thing is , you have to acknowledge it 's ** strengths ** as well as it 's weaknesses . 
  as far as i can see you 're saying ' 80 % of users are under 30 , so that means it 's homogenous ' . 
  that 's just wrong . 
  yeah , it 's not representative of the true population , but 30 % is still a large age range . 
  it 's not like 80 % of users are between the ages of 19-20 . 
  there 's a variety of different perspectives and experiences embodied in the various age groups there . 
  and this over emphasis on age absolutely dwarves a lot of the other more diverse issues ( such as political opinions , where there was usually a clear majority pov but also significant support for minority povs in all but one or two instances ) . 
  ** conclusion/tl ; dr ** : what i am saying is that we need a ** nuanced ** point of view to the diversity or otherwise of the community . 
  it 's not as diverse as the true european population , but like hell it 's not * ` homogenous ' * either . 
  to call / r/europe * ` homogenous ' * is to quite simply ignore all the evidence and nuanced information in that entire survey in favour of over-simplistic uselessness . 
  the point of having large swathes of information is not to help you more easily justified a dumbded down , unwavering and simple interpretation of what is going on , but to help you reach a * more complex * , more * nuanced * and more * accurate * point of view . 
  observing all this information and just saying ` homogenous ' is not accurate . 
  not at all . 
  not about the troubles , but as a non-irish uk person , i 've been finding [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eurodocs/comments/413vk1/bbcs_the_story_of_ireland/ ) really enlightening . 
  so much of the problems of northern ireland have their roots going back hundreds if not thousands of years . 
  knowing all of that background knowledge is potentially the only way to actually understand what 's going on there . 
  if you just learn about the troubles in the abstract , without the context , then all you 're really learning is a series of facts . 
  like saying `` hitler invaded france and then russia . 
  then he was pushed back from russia and then from france and was defeated . '', 
  sure it 's * accurate * and it gives you all the relevant facts but it does n't really * inform * you . 
  tl ; dr you need an overview of all irish history to understand the troubles . 
  otherwise , it 's all just random facts with no meaning . 
   this guy oh god , for a moment i thought you meant [ this guy ] ( https://goo.gl/7f3oce ) and i was like ` what the hell was the shadow chancellor doing in northern ireland in 1981 !? ', 
  `` very specific group '' ? 
  i mean , i see kind of what you 're saying . 
  it 's not 100 % representative of the true population ( it 's shifted more towards the young ) . 
  but i still think you 're being overly harsh . 
  there is a large range of users from ages 16 up till about 40 or 50 and there 's a huge variety of educational backgrounds and there 's a variety of employment backgrounds . 
  so yes , it is tilted towards one demographic , but i think you 're being highly disingenuous when you call it ` homogenous ' . 
  that 's just not accurate . 
  were you on a first year course or a second/third year cause ? 
  i was * really * surprised by how easy 1st year causes are . 
  i got really stressed out about how late i was for an essay . 
  ended up not finishing on the deadline so getting a 5 % reduction in my grade and writing the entire thing in one night and then still getting a first . 
  i still do n't quite understand what happened there . 
  ~ ~ we probably should have polled users feelings towards being a default too . ~ ~ edit : nevermind . 
  we did ask that question . 
  do you think / r/europe should remain a geodefault ? 
  | | | | | -- | -- | -- | | yes | 803 | 38.3 % | | no | 448 | 21.4 % | | i do n't think it matters any way . | 846 | 40.3 % |, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395674032295/a3f653ff-f4f6-42b3-bf0d-4d0106df8a91-620x372.png ) percentage of the population aged 18 to 29 who are living with their parents in each eu country ( and the change since 2007 ) . 
  also [ here 's the interactive map ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2014/mar/24/europe-young-adults-living-parents-map ) . 
   high schoolers a majority ( 54 % ) of the those asked were between the ages of 21 and 30 , whilst only 35.5 % were younger than 21 . 
  young ? 
  yes , definitely . 
  school age ? 
  definitely not . 
  the majority of our users are either also , 40.1 % have achieved a bachelor 's degree or higher ( lots of master 's and doctorates as well ) and many of those who do not have a degree are likely also working towards one , if the 48.4 % who claim to be full time students is any indication . 
  -- tl ; dr : the facts say that / r/europe is * not * ` filled ' with a bunch of high schoolers . 
  in fact , the opposite is true . 
  most of them accept this . 
  i accept this . 
  the thing is , people who are `` pro-refugee '' want to ensure that our desire to punish economic migrants does n't stop us from fulfilling our duty to legitimate refugees ( which is more than 40 % of the migrants ) . 
  that 's what the eurocrats are doing . 
  you have to understand that despite the rhetoric from both camps being quite different , they often are very similar . 
  the only people who are different are some of the efdd etc people who want to send all of them back . 
  what do you expect them to do ? 
  solve the problem in a day ? 
  the eu commission has to work with the parliament and ** 28 separate governments ** . 
  that 's why it 's takin months .
