  we have few if any further indications of why that is , leaving conclusions up to conjecture . 
   books are experiences some : yes . 
  all : no . 
  it 's really stupid that i have to point this out , but look at daniel kahneman 's ` thinking fast and slow ' or ` facts are sacred ' by simon rogers . 
  both of these are mass market books which have reached extreme notoriety . 
  just give me some evidence that this will be the natural result of the current changers in the way we consume content , other than your person ` beliefs ' about the ineptness of the average human . 
  i just think you 're enjoying wallowing in the a depressing view of human nature , not because it is true , but because it is enjoyable to be a pessimist . 
  i respectfully disagree with your interpretation about people 's willingness to put in effort is so limited . 
  the only proof for this i feel that needs to be pointed to , is the long-form content in any of the major newspapers or popular journals . 
  i can buy any broadsheet newspaper and find articles which are the size of an entire double page spread . 
  they newspapers would n't sell this if they could fill it with celebrity bizz news for more money . 
  people are reading that stuff and valuing it , and if that was n't the case , it would n't exist . 
  if nobody consumed long form content anymore , why do books continue to exist ? 
  why are ereaders such a huge economist success ? 
  i just fundamentally disagree with your view society and people . 
  yes , short form , instant gratification contend is very popular . 
  it is not popular , to the total exclusion of long form content . 
  long form content is very valued and if you ca n't agree with that there is space for both long and short form content to be popular , than i do n't think any meaningful discussion can be had between us . 
  well , the reasons why gossip columns do so well is because they easily attract a lot of views and then companies pay to have advertisements near the article . 
  with this model , there could be a lot of high quality political and financial blogs ( i wish there was a less degrading term than ` blog ' ) by individual journalists , because they would charge for their articles to be read , rather than focusing on add revenue . 
  one of the main reasons for the fall in newspaper readership , identified by editors and the like , is that people are n't willing to pay for what they do n't consider to be valuable . 
  if you can tailor your news diet to precisely what you want , then you are going to considering it a lot more valuable than buying * en masse * what the guardian has already selected for you in its print edition that day or on the new york times ' website that day . 
  i know when i buy a newspaper ( especially if it is a national , rather than international , newspaper ) then ignore about half the articles because they are about things i have no interest in : ` shocking ' court verdicts , the latest irrelevant blunder of government , some new medicine that has been invented but will likely come to nothing , et cetera . 
  if i could pay for a newspaper without all of these things i happily would , and with a news diet tailored to my values , i could . 
  given that this problem seems to be a large factor in readership decline , the tailoring approach could be the solution . 
  i do think that already existing newspaper outlets could play a formative role in this . 
  they could provide a forum for individuals to subscribe to specific journalists , and therefor lend their legitimacy to these journalists . 
  as such , they could also take somewhat of a roll in salary redistribution in order to ensure that no journalist starves when whilst they are starting out . 
  effectively , it could be virtually exactly the same as the system is now . 
  the only difference , would be that you only pay for what you want , and will read . 
  and the greater degree of journalistic freedom should , necessarily , lead to a greater diversity of good content . 
  one of the models i 've been seeing in small but increasing quantities , is journalists going freelance specialising in their own topic areas and uploading it to a blog or something . 
  to be honest , i see this is the real way forward for journalism . 
  a sort of * \u00e1 la carte * approach . 
  i think you 'll still need a fixed website , at the very least so that a lot of the journalists can be put on offer in one place , rather than forcing the user to scour the internet for an interesting journalist or two . 
  then you go on that website , go to the topics you 're interested in ( say , international , local environment , business , ect ) , read a few exemplar pieces from a few journalists in those areas and subscribe to the ones you want . 
  brb : going to create an individual journalist subscription system . 
  oh this is getting stupid . 
  i 'd noticed that the downvoting of eurosceptics for no good reason was getting worse , but now this is just out of hand . 
  something really needs to be done . 
  it 's stifling any sort of interesting discussion . 
  obligatory : check my comment history . 
  you can be pro-eu * and * think that constructive criticism and general discussion is good !, 
  why are you getting downvoted so much ? 
  you 're just asking pretty reasonable questions . 
  also , much more ineffective . 
  edit : was merely making a light hearted jab . 
  i certainly do n't mind paying 8 euros every five years to live in an increasingly democratic eu . 
  i got that figure by dividing 200,000 ( quoted in the title ) by 5 ( the number of years they allegedly earn 200,000 over ) . 
  however , i disagree with that number being correct , but i felt my post was already very long . 
  i think their actual salary is much closer to $ 96 thousand per * year * according to [ this page ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/0081ddfaa4/meps.html ) ( quoted at the bottom , under salaries ) . 
  that 's not including tax . 
  after tax it becomes 6.25 thousand per * mont * which translates to 75 thousand per * year * . 
  i think the confusion arises from people specifying salaries , but not over what timeframe ( month , year , tenure in parliament between elections ? ), 
  and then also counting different things as their salary , for instance pre-tax/post-tax , local costs of living included/excluded , services ( e.g. 
  company cars , discounted restaurant ) included/excluded . 
  you can very easily make it look like a lot , by including all of the benefits and excluding tax , then doing it for the whole year or their whole tenure , and you can also make it look very small by counting it for one year or one month and excluding perks and including tax . 
  yes , they pay an eu text instead of belgian/luxembourgish/french taxes . 
  it would be odd if you had to pay taxes to another country if you wanted to serve your own country . 
  it 's also not really appropriate to be paying taxes at your home rate , when you are taking advantages of public services ( roads , ect ) in the country you happen to be working in , which is where the eu tax comes . 
  it might not be the ideal solution , but it squares the circle well enough . 
  the eu tax rate stands at about 20 % . 
  whilst probably not as high as it should be , given the services which they benefit from , both in the countries they work in , and usually in their home countries , but it is still significant and should be remembered when evaluating whether we 're getting value for money or not . 
  20 % either way is a huge difference . 
  i actually do n't think that salary is correct . 
  according to the ep 's own website , it 's 8,000 $ per month and so 96,000 $ per year and then there 's tax . 
  they do get perks , but i think op should provide some explanation for how his estimate of an eu parliamentarians salary is twice as high as what is listed on their own website . 
  even if that is counting `` perks '' l , like being given an allowance to keep up a second home , because mep literally have two separate places of work , which makes it only fair , i 'm not quite sure how there would be over 100 thousand more, 
  ** eu parliament ** ^ ( over a period of five years , and with several thousand members of staff ) ** costs an almost incomprehensible amount of money $ $ $ ** let 's not forget that this figure does not include tax . 
  let 's not forget that the eu parliament includes the largest a d best translation department in the world , because it is one of the only institutions in the world which needs to provide simultaneous translation i to twenty languages . 
  surprisingly , that costs a lot of money and it can not be removed or cut down because it is essential in a transparent democracy , that people be able to know what 's happening in language they understand . 
  let 's not forget that democracy should have no price . 
  the cost of up keeping democratic institutions like the european parliament , house of commons and for referendums , should * never * be an argument for the removal of such institutions . 
  let 's not forget that these figures are spread over five years . 
  i 'm sure you 'd think any one is pretty rich if you said '' ** this person earns ** *** 100 thousand euros *** ^ ( over the course of five years ) '' . 
  an mep earning 40 thousand euros a year does n't sound that extravagant if they are doing their job properly and putting all the hours in and having to maintain constituency and parliament homes . 
  if they are doing a bad job then of course they do n't deserve , but do n't hurt everybody just because a minority a mong them do n't deserve it . 
  punish those individuals as insivoduals.i know this might come as a shock , but most people , even elected politicians , do their jobs and do them pretty decently . 
  oh and lastly , do n't forget to compare the ep , with all of the necessary costs it needs in order to be an effective democratic organ , to other institutions of comparable size ( international company hqs , for instance , or other parliaments ) and you 'll probably find it 's not bad value for money . 
  i really hate these kind of headlines . 
  they inform you of one fact , which in isolation sounds shocking , but upon any kind of close inspection is actually quite ordinary . 
  it plays on the fact that not nobody can be knowledgeable on every subject in order to further distort perceptions . 
  should i be going abroad more ? 
  are those pretzels ? 
  and also , that second guy is dressed very fancy for someone with a head full of simit . 
  is this a poll of just people from france or are others included ? 
  the thing is , they have n't had only 250 hours . 
  sixth form students are allotted private study periods to use for learning their subjects . 
  ideally they would be matching the amount of work done in lessons by the amount outside . 
  so it should be 500 hours just in this passed year . 
  now keep in mind that they 've had several years of foreign language education already , but at a less intense level . 
  you can see why it is disheartening , right ? 
  i 'm not blaming the pupils either . 
  i think the whole way the uk teaches languages is flawed and that students ca n't be expected to thrive in such an environment . 
  that 's what depresses me . 
  all the hours of work which are put in for such little gain . 
  i just do n't think it 's very gooding considering we 're coming to the end of an entire year of having five hours a week of fixed lessons plus all of the time we 're given to do home work and independent study with . 
  it just falls so astonishingly short of what they could be capable of . 
  i 've pointed to a lot of evidence of there being people brought up in the uk who do n't speak english natively and of there being non-english speaking communities throughout this thread . 
  if you have some conclusive census information which illustrates that there are no non-english speaking monoglots in the uk , then i will be forced to concede that you are right , but in the absence of that evidence i think it is very reasonable to assume that there are a significant number of native non-english speakers in the uk .
