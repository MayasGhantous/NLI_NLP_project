  that was why the uk recently had its crazy 7 way debate ( tories/ecr , labour/s & d , lib dems/alde , ukip/efdd , greens/efa , snp/efa , plaid cymru/efa ) , even though some of the parties ( plaid cymru ) only got 0.6 % of the vote . 
  i do n't get why people keep using the word ` banned ' for this . 
  if not being asked to turn up is the same as being banned then i get banned from millions of events every day without even realising it !, 
  you have to show your medical licence every time you comment or we send you to a different subreddit for documentaries about russian gulags . 
  well , there 's always / r/eulaw, 
   the european commission has concluded the rule -- which is part of the dublin regulation -- is `` outdated '' and `` unfair '' , and will be scrapped in a proposal to be unveiled in march , according to officials briefed on its contents . 
  looks like march is the month to watch for . 
  march , and february ( for cameron 's eu announcement ) . 
  `` oh we 're gon na fight today ? 
  is that what you want ? 
  you want to fight ?! '', 
  there 's 8 out of 21 arrested . 
  so it 's likely to be closer to half . 
  and investigations are still ongoing . 
  hmm , i 've been pronouncing it 's - eh-yum ' which could sort of be close enough to be a pun with slim . 
  also , sejm just kind of * looks * like the word slim . 
  to be fair , most of those things are true of putin 's russia as well . 
  timmermans seemed pretty on the ball ? 
  puns, 
   but the chances of that happening are *** sejm *** to none . 
  ftfy !, 
   while parliament are sovereign and can , as a matter of contitutional law , pass an act of parliament requiring all jews to wear a yellow star , this does not mean that we should be concerned that they have this power . 
  the uk is a mature democracy with a stable consitutional system with an entrenched rule of law , with a parliament full of indepent-minded individuals , a free and loud press and so forth . 
  it is these things that effectively constrain the actions of parliament , even if , as a matter of pure constitutional law , parliament is sovereign . 
  so basically you 're just telling me that there is nothing of any substance to balance the house of commons and we should just the ` independent minded individuals ' ( which is a * hilarious * way of describing 80 % of backbench mps , who 're constantly fearing de-selection ) to be benevolent and do the right thing . 
  sorry , but just because they 've managed to go this far without screwing the pooch completely is n't very reassuring , and neither is some weird reference to how we 're a ` mature democracy ' ( what does that even mean ? 
  are random other countries like greece somehow an ` immature ' democracies ? ) . 
  we need proper balance on the government of the day . 
  every other legitimate democracy in the world has it . 
  the uk 's lucked it out this far . 
  it 's time we had a proper safeguard . 
   the good thing about our elected leaders is that we can elect them and we can get rid of them . 
  we ca n't get rid of the eu government . 
  oh pull the other one . 
  just because scottish mps * alone * ca n't determine who the pm of the uk is , does n't mean the pm is n't elected , nor does it mean that he ca n't be democratically removed . 
  in fact , it happens frequently . 
  likewise , the uk meps and the uk 's representative in the council of the eu ca n't * alone * determine who the president of the eu is . 
  that does n't mean that it is n't a democracy and it does n't mean that the they ca n't be democratically removed . 
  the eu is a democracy and you just have to face the facts . 
  sometimes , democracies do things that you do n't like . 
  welcome to the club . 
  it 's time that this absurd myth that eu is somehow governed by magic or secret ministers who 's identities are unknown somehow run the entire thing dies . 
  it 's false . 
  it 's wrong . 
  it 's inaccurate . 
  and what 's more , it is misleading and damaging to our democracy to lie in this way . 
  what , seriously ? 
  that 's even worse than the weimar constitution in german circa 1920-30 which allowed for presidential rule . 
   i am really depressed that these idiots are getting our tax money ... then go out and vote for somebody who deserves it !, 
  and if you do , make sure other people do as well . 
  voter turnout for eu elections is shockingly low , and that 's why these nutjobs get in . 
  there 's a lot of high quality people as well , but there 's also far more nutjobs than you 'd expect . 
  we need more voter scrutiny to make for a better parliament . 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  the citizens have to participate . 
  timmermans ' speech was by far the best . 
  explained exactly how poland had acted illegally . 
  something missing from the entire debate . 
  good speech, 
  you keep using the word holding to account . 
  i agree . 
  the opposition does do that . 
  i 'm not talking about holding to account . 
  i 'm talking about if the government passes an act of parliament which is against our basic human rights , what is there to stop it ? 
  what ** check and balance ** is there ? 
  there is no effective check and balance ( apart from the hol , sort of ) . 
  parliament 's legislation is supreme , and overwrites all else . 
  a * real * check and balance would be if we had a proper constitutional court , which had power overturn legislation if it went against our constitution ( we currently do n't have a codified constitution , though ) and could not be directly influenced by the government or parliament . 
  every other eu country has some version of this , except us . 
  most eu countries even have a second chamber of parliament * as well * as a real constitutional court , which is elected under a different system ( unlike our second chamber , which is appointed by the government of the first chamber ... ) . 
  and do you know what ? 
  the government has disprespected our basic rights before . 
  in the 1940s , the government actually passed and act of parliament which * suspended elections * . 
  that 's how powerful it is . 
  you did n't get that in any other non-occupied country ( like the usa ) . 
  that 's how powerful the house of commons is . 
  compared to stopping elections , stopping our human rights would be child 's play . 
  fortunately when elections were suspended the government was nice enough to reinstate them . 
  i do n't like relying on the benevolence of our elected leaders alone . 
  there must be other effective checks and balances , and currently there are no . 
  the eu is part of that solution . 
   hm 's loyal opposition , the legal system , the independent and loud press , the hol , the electorate , etc etc etc. 
  when you start calling the electorate a check and balance then you know you 're grasping at straws . 
  the point of checks and balances is to keep the elected government in check in between elections . 
  and calling the opposition a check ? 
  the very characterisation of the opposition is that they are in the minority and do n't have the ability to stop a majority vote in the hoc . 
  the house of lords is the only * real * check and balance in there , and that 's not even a real check and balance because the pm can just create a virtually infinite number of new members at will !, 
  could go either way . 
  last time i checked the polls ( the polls of the poles , that is ) pis had dropped to only 25 % support . 
  if the eu parliament is seen to be standing up for the rights of polish citizens , then it could increase support for the eu . 
  one of the reasons i strongly support the eu in the uk is because the uk has no checks and balances , and therefore i feel as though we need the eu to protect our rights , such as by guaranteeing the european convention on human rights ( they can punish us for not protecting human rights according to the treaty , where as if we 're not eu members then the government can just get rid of the convention entirely , with no repercussions ) . 
  this is just what a plenary session is . 
  it 's the same in most countries . 
  a lot of grand standing . 
  the uk parliament did the exact same thing in the second syria debate ( and also pmqs every week ) . 
  nobody said much of interest . 
  they all just did some grand standing . 
  the * real * debates are the low profile ones . 
  i randomly was watching a debate on conflict minerals with only a handful of meps and it was really good . 
  lots of refuting of each other 's points .
