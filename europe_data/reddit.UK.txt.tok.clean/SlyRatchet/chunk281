  they kind interject like they can int he uk house of commons , but they do respond to each other 's points . 
  and in the uk it 's the same as well . 
  only the lower profile debates are good , like the security debate following the tunisia attack .

  i find it interesting how the european parliament is becoming more and more a place for the presidents and prime ministers of member states to come and make their case on a european wide stage . 
  today we 've got the polish pm . 
  we 've had viktor orban , pm of hungary and we 've had alexis tsipras and also merkel and hollande , all addressing the european parliament . 
  very interesting the way this has changed over time . 
  just watched his speech . 
  it was less ` wow ' and trying to get people who already agree riled up , but instead he tried approach it in a much more logical and persuasive manner . 
  at least that was my reading of the speech . 
  and there are 100 million barrels of oil consumed each * day * . 
  so the 300 million tonnes of plastic produced globally is really small change .

  this is a story about iran and oil , not about europe . 
  this obviously has effects on europe , but so does almost everything else in the world economy .

  if you remember when the initial negotiations were taking place , there was a lot of coverage of the previous eu foreign affairs chief , catherine ashton , being largely to credit for all the successes made . 
  it 's very much an eu success story . 
  i would imagine that the culture around abstaining is a bit different , as in the uk parliament there is no abstain option . 
  there is only ay , nay , did n't turn up or ay * and * nay ( effectively an abstention ) . 
  caroline lucas mp ( green party ) has made a big effort to try and include an official ` abstention ' option in parliament , but unfortunately the other parties do n't listen :( additionally , the english court system previously only allowed for innocent or culture verdicts , unlike the scottish system which allowed for an ` uncertain ' verdict ( which allowed the person to be tried for the same crime again at a later date iirc ) . 
  possibly . 
  i know that germans place great national importance on the maintenance of a stable currency , with the history of hyperinflation deep in mind . 
  still , personally i would n't be surprised if there were a [ profound shift in the way germans view themselves ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/10/angela-merkel-will-survive-but-will-the-soul-of-post-war-germany/ ) over the next few years and decades , perhaps including their approach to the currencies . 
  i mean , the german national identity has already come under considerable strain , and the two main parts of it which are left ( commitment to the european union and commitment to a stable currency ) are increasingly coming into conflict with one another . 
  seeing as destruction of the european union could be a consequence of the continued unwaveringness to the euro 's interest rates ... 
  i think that germany 's position on the euro may change . 
  it 's not a word-for-word/literal translation . 
  i gave up a long time ago on word for word translations as they usually are a ) very difficult and b ) obscure the author 's original intent to some degree . 
  so i just translate for my intent . 
  ^ ( also , this probably is n't a very good translation as i 've only been doing french for a few years ), 
  that 's because the eurozone does n't have its own decision making procedures ( although imo that should change ) . 
  it 's basically a question of ` who has the most power ' and the answer to that is ` germany ' . 
  if a eurozone parliament was created ( as some have suggested ) then we could see a eurozone dominated by southern european member states . 
  may i ask , what webpage is this a screenshot form ? 
  the way eu level democracy works , there 's basically never a single state which tips the balance . 
  until very recently , it was considered ** shocking ** if even * one * member state voted against a proposal . 
  the proposals were almost always voted for on a consensus basis , where every single one of the member states would agree . 
  in more recent times , where opinion has been much more divided , the principle of trying to find a solution which is palatable to all has stuck . 
  if there is a disagreement , usually it will only be a very small number of member states who dissent , e.g. 
  when jean claude junker was voted eu commission president only the uk and hungary dissented , and the other 26 member states voted for . 
  edit : a word, 
  still , the fact that there are an awful lot of routine measures that we all agree on is noteworthy in itself . 
  i mean , a lot of people might look at these figures and assume that the uk is totally incompatible with the eu ( and i suspect the stats will be used that way in the upcoming referendum ) where as pointing out that about 90 % of the votes are unanimous kind of makes that a moot point . 
  sure , that remaining 10 % is usually some pretty important stuff ( migration resettlement policies and the appointment of the european commission were both votes which were not unanimous and yet very important ) but that does n't mean that progress is n't also happening in more boring ways . 
  the more boring stuff , like regulation of the common market , expansion of the energy union , sanctions on russia , creation of environmental protection policies , these are all examples of high importance ( but not * necessarily * high profile ) eu council decisions where there was strong agreement . 
   it 's interesting to look at the comparison of recent years to the period 2004-2009 . 
  as you can see , uk only really became an outlier after the tories took the reins in 2010 . 
  before that the uk was at the high end of the chart , but still very close to the mean . 
  ( source ) i think what 's even more interesting is if you look at [ which euro-group the head of each member state is a member of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_european_union#/media/file:party_affiliations_in_the_european_council_\\ ( 28_june_2015 \\ ) . png ) . 
  as you can see , the uk tories were , until recently ( when the new polish government was elected ) , the only ecr ( european conservatives and reformists ) members to have control of an eu member state , where as all of the other member states could find allies in the eu council . 
  what 's more , the epp ( european people 's party ) , s&d ( socialists and democrats ) and alde ( alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ) , the three parties which dominate all of the eu 's 28 member states bar 4 ( the uk , poland , greece and latvia ) are ideologically * very * similar . 
  i mean , those three blocs banded together in order to vote jean-claude junker as the eu commission president , agains opposition from the greens , communists , ecr , europe of freedom and direct democracy ( efdd , the ukip bloc ) and the non-inscrits ( which at that time include le front national and geert wilders ' party ) . 
  je ne connais de rien , que te le puisse faire penser * i do n't know what gave you that idea *, 
  second only to the ~ ~ conspiracy theory ~ ~ * fact * that finland does not exist ( and was actually invented by the japanese to covertly export fish to them under the guise of exporting nokia phones ) . 
  it 's ... 
  it 's beautiful i did n't know what my life goals were before , but now i have found it . 
  this is my life goal . 
  yours , 
  same . 
  i do n't actually plau eu4 , but i like hearing people talk about it . 
  it 's like seeing children frolicking . 
  it just brings you joy to see such glee . 
  not really . 
  greece was the one that compromised to meet eurozone demands . 
  good idea - i 've just sent a pm , 
  yeah , bavarians are some of the most friendly people in europe in my opinion . 
  compare that to people in the ruhr valley and berliner schnauze and it 's a very different story . 
  they 're your typical northern europeans . 
  it 's okay - we all apply stereotypes sometimes  personally , i want to abolish all of the uk 's opt outs and end up with the uk being as integrated as germany is today . 
  i see things like being a member of the schengen zone and the common currency as benefits to the uk rather than detractors . 
  i mean , schengen especially would allow for extra eu tourists to apply for a common schengen visa which includes the uk . 
  as it stands right now , a lot of extra-eu tourists do n't bother going to the uk because it costs so much money and takes so much time to get the additional visa ( and thus the uk loses a lot of money in tourism revenue ) . 
  common currency would increase uk businesses ability to trade with continental businesses in the eurozone ( the world 's second largest economy , after the usa ) . 
  there would be benefits to the uk itself , but also it would strengthen the euro on international markets , and aid in making it the world reserve currency ( like the us dollar is today ) which will give the eu far greater geopolitical influence . 
  however , i would like there to be greater eu oversight of the monetary system to avoid a situation such as happened in greece , including the creation of a common eurozone debt bond . 
  alas , i know i am in the minority on these things ... 
  i 'm certainly a member of the 50-ish % that want to stay in the uk , but most of that 50 % are kind of happy with the status quo , where as i want to radically increase our integration , which i do n't believe is popular .

  i 'm telling you that you misunderstood what i said . 
  the eu does a lot of bad . 
  it should have played a more pro-active role in investigating members states for breaches of the eu constitution . 
  that was a bad thing . 
  the eu can do bad . 
  what it is doing now by inestigating poland for breaches against the constitution * is a good thing * . 
  it ca n't be a bad thing when the eu does n't do something ** and then a bad thing again when it does ** . 
  yeah , of course . 
  whatever the eu does is the wrong thing . 
  all of which is insignificant when faced with the needs to respect our humanitarian obligations . 
   papers wo n't report on it though as they do n't want to appear to be un-pc . 
  they actually reported on it quite a lot . 
  the only stopped because it became boring . 
  i mean , once your reporting on ` migrant tries to jump onto the back of a lorry for the 100th time ' it is n't really front page material .
