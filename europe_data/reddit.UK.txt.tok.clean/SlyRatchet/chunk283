  however , if just because democratic means can not be forced upon them from outside is not an excuse for allowing them to become autocratic . 
  it 's merely an explanation . 
  if poland ( and hungary ) are incapable of respecting other nations ' and the eu itself 's wishes , then it is the prerogative of those nations to exercise their own rights and expel poland from their club . 
  if it comes to that . 
   if they 're afraid of the french why go to france ? 
  because it 's less scary than anywhere else . 
  i do n't think they had an awful lot of options open to them . 
  you 're a refugee if you have been banished from your home due to war or persecution . 
  that describes pretty much the entire population of syria . 
  now , let 's say you 're a legitimate refugee and you go to turkey . 
  all good and legal with that . 
  now , what if you travel through syria to greece ? 
  that 's then an economic decision , rather than one based on war or persecution . 
  at no point did the individual in question * stop * being a refugee . 
  they just also became an economic migrant . 
   and part of the problem is they intentionally wo n't say that they 're from iraq , syria or afghanistan , because that makes it easier to deport them . 
  that 's not really true for all of them . 
  only some . 
  be careful not to tar every refugee with the same brush . 
  the big disagreement about the refugee crisis and its solution has very little to do with the crisis itself , and more about what these refugees are . 
  are they economic migrants ? 
  is there culture incompatible ? 
  are they legitimate refugees ? 
  we need to recognise that not all refugees are the same . 
  i definitely acknowledge that lots of asylum seekers are illegitimate and should be sent back ( approximately half so far , according to the statistics i 've seen ) but that 's some and not all . 
  i think this is actually the european commission treating the polish electorate with respect . 
  if the polish electorate vote for something which is incompatible with eu law , then we should respect the polish electorate 's wishes by pushing them out of the eu , if necessary . 
  yeah , we should * all * be putting into it . 
  that way , we all get more out of it . 
  it does n't work unless we all do our bit . 
  that way , it 's better for everyone . 
  i think it 's fear more than entitlement . 
  you 've got to remember that a lot of these people are coming from iraq , syria and afghanistan , where the governments attack their own civilians . 
  you can understand why they might be mistrustful of a foreign government telling them what to do . 
  i think they 're certainly largely refugees , ** but ** somewhere along the route they also become economic migrants . 
  we 've been treating the terms economic migrant as mutually exclusive . 
  you 're either one or the other . 
  but i do n't think that 's the case . 
  you can be both . 
  i agree with most of what you say * but * i think that you 're underestimating the role of the commissioner who 's actually responsible for this stuff . 
  remember , the european commission has 28 members who all run separate departments ( or , ` directorates general ' or dgs ) . 
  the one who is in charge of the dg for competition policy is a danish woman called [ margrethe vestager ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/margrethe-vestager-defines-her-legacy-antitrust-competition-commission-google-gazprom/ ) . 
  she 's really been at the forefront of all this . 
  she 's responsible for investigating google and apple and now fiat , starbucks and amazon . 
  she 's even launched an anti-trust case against * gazprom * !, 
  she 's really bringing the eu forward in leaps and bounds .

  that 's not necessary true . 
  it 's more complex in my opinion the great tragedy of the 1980s onwards is that we seem to see each other as the problem , rather than the system itself . 
  for instance , immigration does drive down wages in some sectors of the economy , which does have a seriously adverse effect on some people 's quality of life . 
  but why blame immigration when this could easily be fixed through a proper system of social welfare ? 
  if you 've lost your job through no fault of your own , why should you be forced to pay the price ? 
  but the immigrant has done no wrong either . 
  in fact , they are providing a net benefit to the rest of society economically ( they are either better at the job then you are , or willing to work for less , both of which lead to higher quality and cheaper products for consumers ) . 
  so why punish the immigrant when they have both done no wrong and provide a net benefit to society ? 
  the only just solution i can see is to provide a proper safety net and proper resources so that people who are priced out of their own jobs can be retrained for something else without taking a financial loss . 
  interesting , i flicked through and only saw the word `` asylanten '' which could be either and given that there was no differentiation between the two in the op i figured the police had n't . 
  i 'll look through the full report when i get home . 
  this is interesting information . 
  thank you for posting it . 
  it 's a shame that the police report does n't seem to differentiate between asylum seekers and those who have been granted asylum . 
  i 'd be interested to know how many ( if any ) of those who have been granted asylum participated in these attacks . 
  depending on that , it could significantly change how we ought to respond,

  i know that feeling :( i try and make moderate comments in every thread which basically say `` yes , we need to make efforts to deal with the situation closer to its source , but we must also respect our obligations to our fellow human beings who are suffering '' . 
  then both sides downvote me because they both think i 'm supporting the other side, 
  i always feel weird , but i find articles with no pictures to be really appealing ... like , i actually * dislike * pictures . 
  it feels as though there 's too many things trying to get my attention . 
  just give me * one * thing to focus on and digest properly ffs !, 
  here is a random double page spread from yesterday 's [ sunday times ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n0hcuew.jpg ) there are two adverts and five pictures , all competing for my attention . 
  collectively these images take up ** over half the page ** . 
  now here is a copy of today 's [ financial times ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l2jce4s.jpg ) . 
  there are a similar number of images ( two adverts , two/three pictures + two sets of diagrams ) but it takes up between a quarter and half of the page instead of between half of the page and three quarters , and the diagrams actually * add * information rather than just distract you . 
  i 'd be very interested to see if the night-mayor idea can be successful . 
  it seems like a good idea . 
  i 'm gon na be checking if my local city has one , or if it 's getting one . 
  i 've stopped using weed . 
  i 've only had it a handful of times , but each time i tried it it got progressively worse , to the point where i was terrified and had to seek out somebody else in my house and sit down with them because i was scared . 
  i really like the way the economist describes mdma / ecstasy  mdma , or ecstasy , which makes bonding with strangers and dancing to repetitive thumping sounds far more enjoyable, 
  do youths today have less money to spend ? 
  i would have thought that they would have more money to spend . 
  edit : just did some googling and the first that came up was [ this ] ( http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111%2fj.1470-6431.2006.00559.x?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=onlinelibrary.wiley.com&amp;purchase_site_license=license_denied ) which says  the results show that teenagers ' disposable money hasincreased little between 1977 and 2003 in comparison with the general income develop-ment although the rest of the article is pay walled , so i 'm not sure if they have adjusted for inflation , etc. 
   at least around here most places are 20 + or 22 + or 25 + wow , how strange . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's not a thing in the uk . 
  i remember in germany they had a strange quirk with their diskotheken too . 
  16 year olds could go in , but only if they had an 18 year old with them . 
  or more precisely , an 18 year old could allow in two 16 year old friends . 
  so i ended up being able to get in a bunch of my german exchange partner 's friends who were under 16 whilst i was over 18 . 
  and the vomit !, 
  never forget about the vomit . 
  that 's half the fun !, 
  i do a lot of political work in my city ( stuff relating to local government ) and quite often , there 's basically nothing you can do .
