  and when you can do something , usually it 's worse than the status quo . 
  whatever decision you make , somebody will be worse off for it . 
  it 's about balancing it all so that most people get something good . 
  in this instance , some of the local occupants get the short end of the stick , but there needs to be a club somewhere . 
  you ca n't just ban night clubs altogether . 
  it 's unfair to those who like clubbing ( which is a lot of people ) . 
  at least they 've limited the number of them so that most residents of the town do n't have to deal with it , whilst still allowing there to be a place for clubbers to go . 
  it 's really the best solution , even if it 's not perfect , for no solution ever is perfect . 
  this is definitely the case with the free news websites . 
  when you 're the product , not the consumer , do n't be surprised when you 're not getting a high quality experience . 
  ** however ** a lot of pay-for services are actually starting to do incredibly well . 
  a small number of the best british periodicals are actually having their numbers of paying readers increase , rather than decrease , such as the economist , the new statesman and the spectator . 
  i think the times may be doing well too ( which has a pay-for online site , unlike the uk 's other 3 broadsheets ) but i have n't examined the stats for that . 
  when you 're the customer ( rather than the product ) you fined that the quality goes up * hugely * . 
  then the only thing you need to be worried about is the paper 's biases , rather than its motives . 
  i would really recommend shelling out the extra money for a financially independent news source , rather than one which is dependent on advertising revenues . 
  yeah it 's the blue led light which radiates off of them . 
  there 's also some modern street lamps and house lighting which have blue leds . 
  it deactivates the melatonin production in your brain and stops you from sleeping . 
  you can get special glasses which filter it out , although i 've never tried them . 
  personally , my normal method is to generally avoid compute contact an hour before bed and any contact i do have is at a very low brightness . 
  then i watch a video or a podcast to go to sleep to . 
  i actually have a much worse experience sleeping if there is nothing to distract me whilst i 'm getting to sleep . 
  i think too much if there 's nothing to distract me . 
  shhhh do n't let them know we 're here . 
  i 'm trying to film a david attenborough documentary and you 'll frighten them away . 
  ^ ( * as you can see , the common garden greek is attracted by the smell of politics . 
  he uses this opportunity to socialise with their peers . 
  each attempts to assert dominance over the others due to the prestige of their opinions . 
  this is most exhilarating . 
  look , here 's one now ... * ), 
  i 'm not talking to you guys until you apologise for not inviting me to the new year 's party !, 
  * faces away from jebus and sulks *, 
  world 's actually far better than it was in years passed . 
  there are fewer wars and fewer deaths by war , but also the missile race and threat of imminent threat of nuclear annihilation are gone . 
  not only that , but due to industrialisation in china and india , hundreds of millions of people have been brought out of absolute poverty in the last few years and will continue to be in the years to come . 
  the world 's , and europe 's , problems only seem so bad because we , and our medias , pay more attention to them now than they did before . 
  that 's not a bad thing . 
  it 's good that we 're focusing on the real issues . 
  it 's good that we , as a species , are never satisfied . 
  we will continue to be perplexed by our collective problems and endeavour to leave the world a better place by solving them . 
  we may never be satisfied , but that 's something worth enjoying and celebrating . 
  i have sleeping problems generally ( i 'm on the highest dosage of melatonin tablets that doctors are allowed to prescribe ) but it 's just been very bad over the christmas period because i 've obviously been trying to `` relax '' but that just means that i take less daily exercise which means i 'm not tired enough to go to sleep which means i stay up longer and wake up later and repeat and repeat until eventually i 'm awake the whole night . 
  i know , it 's silly . 
  the use of the word liberal , conservative , socialist and even fascist are all wildly misused in general english discourse . 
  and even if they 're not misused they 're all used inconsistently based on context . 
  i think it 's just because the true meanings of the words liberal ( emphasising liberty ) and conservative ( opposite of change ) are a little complex , where as they can be easily simplified as ` spend lots ' and ` spend little ' . 
  things inevitably get simplified : / it 's a shame because obviously liberal and conservative could be very precise words which would provide a lot of insight . 
  yeah it 's very interesting how incapable states are of acting in a globalised world on all sorts of issues . 
  it 's just that usually we think of tax evasion , rather than child care services . 
  i think that we need to start getting international responses to all of these issues as states alone quite obviously ca n't deal with them . 
  yeah , i would like to know more about the specific cases . 
  i actually think that the main story here * is n't * that social services sometimes do their job badly ( although that is tragic and should be corrected ) but also that social services can so easily be manoeuvred . 
  it requires some sort of response at a european level in my opinion . 
  like i said , the article itself does n't say anything of interest . 
  it just lists a random mp who has campaigned on the issue and the case of one other woman who has her kids taken away by social services . 
  what 's interesting is the charity itself . 
  it 's interesting that social services can just be out manoeuvred so easily . 
  been awake for about 30 to 40 hours over the weekend due to being unable to sleep during the night and then needing to be awake during the day . 
  it 's absolutely torture . 
  you become unable to think of enjoy anything so you 're just like a bored human vegetable . 
  finally slept now though and back to my ordinary conscious self, 
  this is the charity http://www.childrenofthevoiceless.org/ i 've had some personal experience of social services in the uk being heavily biased against low income families . 
  it 's very sad . 
  the rest of the article is n't very interesting ( i 'd copy paste it if i had the digital instead of physical copy ) so just look at the website instead, 
  you mean fiscally conservative . 
  being fiscally conservative is a about cutting taxes and generally is accompanied by faith in the private sector and cutting ` red tape ' . 
  being `` fiscally liberal '' is n't really a term that i 've ever heard used , but would probably be the opposite ( ` supporting higher government spending ) . 
  please remember that down votes are not `` i disagree '' buttons . 
  this comment is the most down voted ( -3 ) but has produced by far the best discussion of the whole thread . 
  is n't it enlightening when we exchange opposing views ? 
  what do you mean exactly by fiscally liberal ? 
  does this mean it 's finished with or could it come back ?

  communism , or , y' know , an active war . 
  war is n't good for business, 
  when jean claude junker announces a new piece of legislation , does he do so as a luxembourger or as the president of the european commission ? 
  he does it as the president , obviously . 
  \u00d6ttinger is the same . 
  he wrote that leader as the head of a directorates general of the european commission and therefore is nationality is pretty much irrelevant . 
  he is a member of the european commission and that is what we should interpret the letter as . 
  i 'd say this is mandatory watching for anyone that wants to understand the greek debt crisis or even the european union . 
  also [ my megatthreads ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c6bul/greek_referendum_megathread/ ) are also a great start :d this is my comment from / r/eurodocs  this is probably my favourite documentary about germany . 
  it provides ** not only ** an overview of the woman herself , her character , background , political persuasions - which is something that is ever more important in this age of a continent dominated by merkel and where she is considered the [ most influential person in the world ] ( http://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/styles/resp_orig_custom_user_narrow_1x/public/wpr/articles/2015/12/merkel-time-person-of-year-today-151209_5814f6f2c30b9ba9ea6d5e4abecba4ec.today-inline-large_custom-855799b0c4fba4fcd4f12c3809d507a4585e9167.jpg?itok=ckfncfs5 ) - ** but also ** an overview of germany in this period . 
  merkel could not have succeeded if she was born a few years earlier or a few years later , because her success depended largely on seizing the opportunities which history gave her . 
  the fact that she was an east german who was neither too old nor too young when the wall fell , allowed her to reinvent herself from the physicist that she was then to the politician that she is now .
