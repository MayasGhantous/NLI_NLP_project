  but she has n't merely made germany . 
  germany and its history has quite strongly shaped her . 
  her upbringing in the east , under the watch of the stasi police , has doubtlessly had a big impact on the way she operates ( often operating quietly , and without relying on others ) and perhaps also influences her policies ( much speculation has been made of the personal anger of angela merkel when her phone was allegedly hacked by the americans ) . 
   so all in all it 's a very good documentary which will increase your knowledge of germany today hugely . 
  and it 's not particularly taxing either . 
  andrew marr 's style is easy to digest and keeps your attention without effort . 
  perfect score : 5/7, 
  it was bad enough already without this cheese theft . 
  if only we could go back to the days where beheadings were the worst of our worries . 
  who 've have thought things could get worse , but we found a way, 
  i would n't say it 's misleading , but i agree that it is n't very informative . 
  the thing is , i just tried to accurately translate the article that heute.de uses . 
  i read the headline ; was shocked ; read the article ; was less shocked . 
  then i posted it because it 's still interesting . 
  -- anyway , it 's unclear when the bundestag 's * new * access-pass ( ` hausausweise ' ) system will be implemented nor what the system will look like . 
  it could be months until new access-passes are issued , meaning that new lobbyists could be bared from the bundestag for a long time . 
  and when they * are * eventually issued , it could be a lot more restrictive than the current system , where a huge number of lobbyists ( thousands ) are given free reign over the entire building . 
  hopefully they 'll adopt a system similar to the new one implemented in the european commission , where all meetings with commissioners and the head civil servants in each department have to be put on a transparency register . 
  also an example to the white indigenous population that muslims can be normal people, 
  yeah , just like when enoch powell predicted the collapse of british civilisation ( or , well [ `` rivers of blood '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rivers_of_blood_speech ) ) because of indian and african immigration to the uk in the 60s . 
  they do n't seem to have made us collapse yet . 
  in the mean while , i 'm enjoying all the lovely curry, 
  there 's a crime spike at new year 's eve * every year * because the police have been too underfunded to deal with nye even * before * we the refugee crisis . 
  [ more info ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:bundesarchiv_bild_183-09709-0002,_dresden,_ankunft_eines_indischen_gaststudenten.jpg ) according to the wikipage , it was in [ bad schandau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bad_schandau ) and the student was on their way to dresden, 
  yeah , i mean , let 's imagine for a moment that it was n't asylum seekers who perpetrated this . 
  sex crime and rape has existed in germany before the war in syria began , and will continue even if there were no immigrants . 
  let 's say that group of indigenous germans did this . 
  well , the police still would not have been unable to prevent this from happening , exactly the same . 
  for that , the police must be held responsible . 
  at the end of the day , crime will always happen . 
  we 'll never live in a society where nobody commits crime . 
  and for when crime is committed , we need a capable police force . 
  the cologne police force has proven that it was incapable .

  do you know what decade this is in ? 
  did n't know that this was a thing in west germany , even if it is swabia, 
  to be fair , i 've heard some of my polish and japanese friends talk about similar things . 
  apparently in the more rural areas of poland , it 's so homogenous that if a black person shows up people will stop and stare a bit . 
  any poles corroborate ? 
  touch\u00e9, 
  the claim that there were 1,000 perpetrators has actually been thoroughly debunked . 
  januar . 
   * the number of perpetrators is also unclear . 
  the size of the perpetrator group varies from two or three up till 20 people according to eye witnesses , the police said . 
  in the area of the station there were about 1,000 travellers on the 1st of january according to the authorities . 
  the acts were committed `` by a large , very drunk swarm of more than 1,000 people . '', 
  that does not mean that all the people [ in the crowd ] are suspects . 
  how many alleged perpetrators were in the thrawl is unknown , said the police president on the 5th of january * ( my translation , done quickly . 
  potential small errors ) . 
  [ die zeit ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2016-01/koeln-silvester-sexuelle-uebergriffe-raub-faq ) estimates i 've seen from elsewhere suggest that it is only approximately 60 individuals within the thrawl that were actually doing these acts . 
  it 's far too early to tell accurately though . 
  but based on the 121 reports of sexual assault in cologne , and the fact that the perpetrators likely harassed more than one woman each , the number of criminals in cologne could well be around 60 . 
  yes , please . 
  let 's all post every instance of a refugee doing something bad ever . 
  [ tagesschau ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/uebergriffe-105.html ) says there there are also 3 suspects being investigated in baden . 
  the tagesschau again claims that there were 121 reports in cologne and 50 in hamburg . 
  [ die welt ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150735341/die-meisten-waren-frisch-eingereiste-asylbewerber.html ) says that most of those identified so far have been ` freshly arrived syrians ' . 
  [ die bild ] ( http://www.bild.de/wa/ll/bild-de/unangemeldet-42925516.bild.html ) has also published a video , which identifies some of the attackers . 
  [ tagesschau ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/uebergriffe-105.html ) says there there are also 3 suspects being investigated in baden . 
  the tagesschau again claims that there were 121 reports in cologne and 50 in hamburg . 
  well , `` i do n't believe you '' is kind of a pointless thing to say , where as `` source ? '', 
  is like `` i do n't believe you , but i am willing to be persuaded if you do something '' . 
  it 's more constructive . 
  you do n't have to believe me . 
  i 've read the source and i find out interesting . 
  whether you believe that i did it or not is irrelevant to me . 
  i asked for the source , and i got it . 
  this makes me happy . 
  i do n't care what anybody else reading the comment thinks . 
  the only point i am trying to impress home to you , is that you and everybody else should look for the original sources , and not just believe blindly what a redditor ( or anybody else ) tells you . 
  they may not be lying deliberately , but people very frequently misremember . 
  i did google it and could n't find it . 
  that 's why i asked for a source . 
  if the source is n't easily available and the redditor does n't provide it , then the information is as good as false . 
  you need to ask for sources . 
  otherwise , you could and often are being wildly misinformed about things . 
  always go back to the source of the information . 
  a lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth has put its trousers on . 
  well , we sort of are in charge . 
  the eu and its member states ( as much as people like to say otherwise ) are democracies , where the people have control . 
  i 've done some work with local party politics and i 'm amazed how much influence the general public actually has on the direct nuts and bolts of the whole thing , at least at a local level . 
  so , i always feel like saying `` my opinion does n't matter '' or `` i 'm not responsible '' is kind of a cop out . 
  your opinion does matter and you are responsible , just like me and just like everyone else . 
  -- with the deporting thing , i 'm a bit more lukewarm . 
  if you are a * legitimate * refugee then that means you are fleeing persecution or war , basically . 
  you 're afraid for your life , usually . 
  so , if you commit a crime i think it is a bit extreme to essentially condemn you to death by sending you back to your country of origin . 
  the punishment must be proportional to the crime , even if you are a refugee . 
  if you 're a refugee , you 're still human . 
  and as such , you should be face proper justice for your actions , and not be disproportionally punished simply because you happen to have come from a war zone . 
  punish the crime ? 
  yes !, 
  but do n't punish unfairly . 
  well there in lies a potential solution !, 
  distribute them properly !, 
  i 've argued for this for a long time . 
  yeah , everyone seems to be making it a religious issue . 
  religion is involved , but i do n't really think it matters .
