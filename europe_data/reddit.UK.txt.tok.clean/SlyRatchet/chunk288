  i was merely commenting on the irony that the best way to solve this crime would be to do something farage is dead set against . 
  i 'm sorry what ? 
  did you read my comment ? 
  it does n't . 
  i 'm saying it should, 
  i did n't write that , but i believe it should say ` incident ' which is what i have corrected it to . 
  they believe they had been deliberately unscrewed ( or at least one of the police man allegedly said to farage immediately after the crash that all four are unlikely to come off by themselves all at the same time ) but deliberately unscrewing somebody 's wheelnuts does n't necessarily mean it 's attempted murder . 
  i mean , many of the pranks that people post to youtube these days are pretty dangerous and could result in death , but i do n't think that death was ever the intention . 
  i do n't have anywhere near enough information to make that sort of judgement though . 
  that 's for the police to do . 
  iirc french police do n't believe this is a murder attempt . 
  nigel farage thinks it is . 
  i read in another source that he was n't bringing the matter forward with the uk police ( who 're likely the ones who can actually do something about this , seeing as it 's unlikely anybody in france is responsible for this ) . 
  i also read that he was being unco\u00f6perative with the french police , but i 'm not sure where i read that so may be speculation . 
  there 's hugely a surprising amount which can be done . 
  people who 're stupid enough to unscrew the bolts on someone 's car are usually stupid enough to leave evidence . 
  and depending on where farage parked his car over the preceding days , it should n't be too difficult to narrow down a set of suspects . 
  i mean , if somebody unscrewed everything , then he ca n't have driven far before the wheels came off . 
  so it 's a small time period . 
  and if he was at the european parliament , his work house or his constituency house , then there was likely coverage for his car , meaning only people who had access to these places could have done it . 
  that , or somebody has actually been following him around , waiting to unscrew the bolts whilst he parks on the street , which means it 'll be even easier to catch them because there 'll be large periods of time for which they have no alibi . 
  all i can gather from this is that farage is either being intimidated by the group not to pursue the matter ( which means we should investigate it ) or the investigation would uncover facts about farage that he does n't want the police to know ( in which case we should also investigate it ) . 
  what i find very strange is that this happened back in october 2015 and farage has no intention of pursuing the matter . 
  something funny 's going on . 
  either way , i think that , regardless of farage 's wishes , the culprit should be found and caught . 
  they could attack somebody else , and that 's without considering the potential for a collision involving other cars on the motorway . 
  incidentally , this would probably be a good opportunity for a european police force to investigate , seeing as it 's almost certain a cross border crime , which i a sure farage would love , 
  i 'm aware of that ( i skimmed the article for the sufficient details beforehand ) . 
  however , you ca n't quote an article , or any one , for that matter , out of context . 
  our rule on editorialising means you , generally speaking , have to use the same title that the linked article uses . 
  or failing that , you have to use what 's in the title , sub title or first paragraph . 
  the ` wenn vier von zehn ... ' section is in the middle of the article . 
  there 's further problems with it as well . 
  the ` vier von zehn ' generally translates to ` four out of [ every ] ten ' so 40 % is n't a direct translation . 
  additionally ` wenn ' usually implies a conditional tense ( i.e. 
  what is being said is n't necessarily true ) . 
  the point is , submission title is supposed to represent what the author of the linked submission ( in this case , faz.net ) intended . 
  messing with their words to change the prioritisation or emphasis is editorialising , and as such , not allowed here . 
  i 've not heard of them and google gave me mixed results . 
  i 've started contacting the european space agency and cern via email and will start phoning them once i get a voip system set up .

  yes , actually . 
  he 's not exactly an inspiring speaker , but he is good at using language to his advantage . 
  if you watch him on the regular prime minister 's question time where he faces up against the labour leader every wednesday , you can see that he is very effective . 
  he always comes across well ( even if he does n't actually answer the question well ) . 
  because of pmqs , most pms and potential pms ca n't get away with being bad orators . 
  gordon brown was just awful at it and lost the general election . 
  so was ed miliband . 
  ian duncan smith was sacked as tory leader before he even fought a general election . 
  all were bad orators and performed horrendously at pmqs . 
  also interesting are the traffic stats [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/about/traffic/ ) / r/de 's and [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/about/traffic/ ) / r/france 's ( and [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/about/traffic/ ) / r/europe 's just for the hell of it ) -- / r/de and / r/france actually have an almost identical amount of unique views on a monthly basis . 
  the only difference is that / r/de is very erratic where as / r/france is almost constant and regular ( apart from the paris november 13/14 ) . 
  / r/de does seem to be on a strong upwards trend , though . 
  it 's more like damned if you do n't and fucked if you do . 
  the consequences of a few job losses and potentially slightly higher heating bills are tiny in comparison to the consequences of allowing emissions to continue rising . 
  this is exactly the kind of short-termist bollocks which is killing our planet . 
  sacrifices have to be made today in order to save the planet tomorrow . 
  we 're actually already working on getting an ama with nigel farage . 
  i 'm pretty sure i 've made comments in / r/europemeta already to that effect . 
  our political opinions have basically no bearing on how we moderate or who we pick for amas . 
  the only reason we 've been done mostly centrist and left-of-centre parties so far is because those were the ones who answered our calls first . 
  i have reached out to ecr and efdd members already but no results as of yet . 
  definitely agree with the sentiment here ( although i 'd say we can have culture * and * politics ) . 
  i 'd appreciate more recommendations for cultural figures/groups who you 'd like to do amas with . 
  before we posted this thread , we were already formulating some sort of plan to get timur vermes who wrote [ * ` er ist wieder da ' * / ` look who 's back ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/look_who%27s_back ) , which is a bestselling ( comedy ) novel in germany at the moment , about if adolf hitler were to wake up in berlin again today ; and also someone who is involved with the production of [ the bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bridge_ ( danish/swedish _ tv_series ) ) which is a hugely successful crime drama , involving a serial murderer who is active in both denmark and sweden ( we saw it was very popular in the ` what is your favourite film from another european country ' ^ [ [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hp7uf/whats_your_country_best_show_which_show_of/ ) , ^ [ 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1xfvu0/whats_your_favourite_film_from_another_european/ ) ] thread on this subreddit and decided to look into it more deeply ) .

  hey hey !, 
  i 'm not being racist towards americans . 
  i 'm being racist towards donald trumps !, 
  but the eu * is * far more homogenous than nato . 
  i mean , nato includes almost every eu state and then a whole load more . 
  nato is essentially more diverse . 
  -- are there differences between eu states on foreign policy issues ? 
  yes , definitely . 
  policy towards russia is the key example ( with germany being more sympathetic to russia and the rest of eastern europe being extremely anti-russia ) . 
  however , are those differences reconcilable ? 
  yes . 
  for instance , on russia , all states want peace with and independence from russia . 
  the question is only a matter of achieving it . 
  this is not necessarily the case for countries like the usa or turkey . 
  there are scenarios where the usa benefits from a crumbling russia in ways that europe does n't . 
  likewise , european policy on islamification and daesh is pretty homogenous . 
  we want to limit the numbers of refugees and limit the amount of islamism in our societies . 
  this does n't really effect the usa ( or canada ) that much because they 're not a focal point for asylum seekers from syria . 
  on the other hand turkey has other interests revolving around kurdistan , which no other eu state shares . 
  -- so nato is quite clearly a much more disparate group than the eu . 
  the fact that the eu is already a very well integrated ( e.g.
