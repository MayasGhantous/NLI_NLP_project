  irish speakers actually make up a sizeable portion of the population there , and the language is spread across the whole country , rather than limited to a small number of selected regions . 
  in the uk , there 's only a handful of communities which you can get by in a given language in , and they are usually very small . 
  in the west of ireland , there 's actually quite a lot of places where you can function and lead a normal life without knowledge of english . 
  it 's very , very , very rare . 
  i went to the next village to buy weed from somebody once , and i had to understand him more through context than what he was actually saying , but that 's a different sort of thing . 
  tell me about it . 
  i 'm still glad i took the subject because i love learning languages , but it does get a bit depressing when all but 3 of the ten people in the class ^ ( ( yes , only ten people do german out of a sixth form of about 200 people ) ^ ) , and i am including myself in as one of the three , are only there because * `` well i had to pick something , and i did alright at my gcse german . 
  '' * i 'm just hoping it 's different at degree level , and that it is different for other languages . 
  i hear spanish is quite popular , whilst german is the least popular of the traditionals . 
  [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornish_language ) indicates that there were at least 20 native speakers way back in 2000 . 
  this has likely increased during the past decade and a half . 
  the celtic revival has been pretty intense with numbers of speakers in those languages rising sharply . 
  i would n't be surprised if by now we have got some cornish communities which speak exclusively cornish . 
  i do n't think that the cornish speaking community will be effecting the outcome of this map , but i think combined with welsh , gaelic and so on , it could be about as significant as non-english speaking immigrants, 
  [ it was revived ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornish_revival ), 
  one of the signers of the petition is an ex-socialist prime minister ; does he/she hold much clout in the political arena these days ? 
  apart from that , it just seems to be the usual crowd who often campaign for this sort of thing but get ignored ( a green mep , and the head of reporters without borders ), 
  i think you missed a `` not '' in your sentence , as i am sure that more than 5 % of the population can speak english . 
  either that or i 'm actually the one percent and never realised . 
  i 'm hoping that if we keep pretending that nobody understands the norn ironders , they 'll eventually just join with the south again , and the problem will be over . 
  you now speak german as well as half of my as-level german peers , who , by the way , are 16 to 17 and have specifically chosen german as one of their four core subjects : /, 
   if you are interested i can spell out the story about how the british took over the local cement factory and made it more efficient than the germans or dutch ever could i 'm interested !, 
  the thing which makes it a constitutional crisis , is that there is no useful precedent . 
  too much has changed between the english civil war and now that such a precedent would maybe get a glance and then be deemed too different . 
  let 's keep in mind that the map says  95 % , which does n't mean that 5 % of the uk do n't speak english , but that < 5 % ie less than 5 % or less then 3,000,000 people speak english . 
  out of that less than 3 million , i think a significant proportion are probably in rural communities with their own regional languages . 
  most who live in rural communities with local languages do speak english , just like most immigrants speak english , but there 's a few that do n't which is what stops the uk from having 100 %, 
  it 's probably got more to do with rural communities that speak non-england languages ( cornwall , wales , shetland , n-ireland ) combined with people who have slipped through the safety nets of society , * combined * with immigration and asylum . 
  probably more specifically , the salisbury doctrine . 
  in the 1940s the leader of the house of lords stated that any law which the commons tries to pass in the lords , which was put in the parties manifesto before that party won election , will be passed by the lords without trouble or delay . 
  and the lords have kept to this doctrine for 60 years , despite there being no written document demanding them to do so . 
  you 'd still get the same potential stand off between the queen refusing to grant royal assent and the commons claiming that royal assent is irrelevant , which is where the constitutional crisis is coming from . 
  i doubt qeii would be happy with her bloodline being passed out of existence , nor would charles . 
  they might accept it and sign the law anyway , but they also might not and create a constitutional crisis . 
  i suppose is this probably a bad time to mention that in the hight of the financial crisis and after scotland elected the snp there was a lot of discussion about the use of sterling verses the euro , and it looked like pretty much every one was ok with letting ireland use the pound of they wanted to . 
  with scotland that 's a different story because their government acts like they have a right to it . 
  just an interesting tit bit !, 
  * viva la royaume de la france !, 
  so what you 're saying , is there 's a chance ? 
  parliamentary sovereignty mostly applies to the primacy of uk parliamentary law . 
  for instance , the uk has no codified constitution that the courts can use to strike down laws , like in the usa ( although some very weak examples of judicial review are in place due interesting ecj rulings and the human rights act ) . 
  the other main manifestation of this , is that no parliament can bind its successor parliament . 
  the really important thing to remember here though , is that parliament is n't just the house of commons and the house of lords , but is also ** arguably ** includes the reigning monarch . 
  every single law in british history as received royal assent . 
  there 's obviously no written document which outlines the powers and responsibilities of difference branches of government . 
  the important thing to remember , is that everybody acknowledges that government should do what the public thinks best . 
  technically we have parliamentary sovereignty ( sovereignty of parliament ) rather than popular sovereignty ( where the population are considered sovereign ) , but at the end of the day conventions and history account for nothing if you stop abiding by the fundamental tenants of democracy . 
  so the nebulous question of whether or not a bill can become law without royal assent becomes irrelevant . 
  i hope this was at least partially enlightening, 
  follow up question : * republics of europe , what would be the process of reinstating/establishing a monarchy in your country and how much support would such an initiative receive ? 
  uk : parliament pass an act . 
  the queen either signs the bill ( ` grants royal assent ' ) into law , abolishing her own position and annulling the requirement for her to ever sign anything into law in the future and everything is hunky dory . 
  * or * she refuses , in which case parliament will claim that ** a ) ** the queen is ignoring the will of the democratically elected government and therefor the people ** b ) ** parliament is the truly sovereign body and therefor has the right to legislate on all matters with or without the queen 's assent ** c ) ** that royal assent is not necessary for a bill to become law in the first place , because it is merely a constitutional convention that has never been written down in any official document and therefor can be ignored or ** d ) ** all of the above . 
  so long as parliament genuinely has the will of a majority of an almost majority of the population behind it , then the monarchy will be abolished without much trouble . 
  the worst that will happen is that a referendum is held and both parties agree to accept its verdict . 
  if the government does not have clear backing from the public then things could become very awkward for everyone involved , and for the status of the whole country , really . 
  it 'd become a full blown and serious constitutional crisis . 
  it 's not like there 'd be a civil war , but pretty much every principle that underpins government ( apart from those enshrined in statute law and maybe common law , which is n't much ) would be in question . 
  as for what the public 's response for a swift and orderly abolishing of the monarchy would be : it would be a mixture of `` oh well . 
  i thought they were alright '' to the other extreme `` glad to see the back of that '' . 
  as you can see , people would be deeply concerned . 
  as for what would happen in the case of the more serious constitutional crisis , well , that really depends on how it plays out , which we ca n't know unless it happens . 
  i thought there was a one year window where the government had to implement the wishes of the people ? 
  so surely it is in a quite forseeable time frame ? 
  yeah , we 're usually worried about our culture being destroyed , rather than our genes mixing . 
  i know in the uk , we do n't care what colour your skin is * if you have a good accent * . 
  on the other hand , if you do n't have a good accent , then you might find yourself being casually discriminated against in a lot of instances , without you realising . 
  i 'm sorry , but i do n't see the racism . 
  i see a typical londoner being rude to a random person who was only asking for directions . 
  it 's a strange response to imply that your friend was being rude , but perhaps he was blocking her path or did n't quite use the words you described . 
  anyway , i 've received similar responses from people in london before . 
  nothing about politeness , but angry gestures , brief shouts , get-out-of-my-way 's and so on . 
  i really think you 're extrapolating something which is n't there in any great quantity . 
  i do n't doubt that london can be a traumatic experience . 
  i know i do not want to live there because it is so busy and can really grind you down if it 's not the sort of thing you enjoy , but then that 's all large cities and that goes for all races of people . 
  let 's hope that both stereotypes are wildly incorrect , 
  are you sure it was because of her skin colour ? 
  i do n't know about you , but i could n't get anybody to speak to me in london and i look about as typical british as its possible to be , with my white skin , blue eyes and brown hair . 
  they 're not very friendly people . 
  personally , i do n't think i would feel comfortable allowing any form of genetic modification in order to solve these problems without a coherent rule for when genetic modification is , and is not acceptable . 
  otherwise it could very easily become a slippery slope . 
  i think these problems should be solved , but we have to do in an appropriate fashion . 
  racism 's no more of a problem here than it is in any other part of the western world . 
  there are some small sections of society which can be quite xenophobic , but that 's true anywhere . 
  you wont have difficulty leading an average life so long as you can speak the native language well , and adhere to its customs . 
  you * certainly * wont be looked down upon for being an american . 
  people might make a joke about it , but they wont think any less of you for it . 
  there 's a lot of people who disagree vehemently with the us government on all lots of different things , but we think it 's * the government * and that you personally played no part in it . 
  even if you really agree with everything the usa does , so long as you are polite about it , nobody will think any less of you . 
  even if racism is a problem , indians or indian-americans are not the people that racism is directed towards . 
  before i explain this , i 'm going to point out that it 's only * the most far-right political parties * which actually paint these sorts of pictures . 
  i know you 've probably heard stories of ukip and the front national getting 25 % and 28 % of the vote in the most recent elections , but please remember that in the elections that these parties usually do well , have about 30 % turnout . 
  they do not have wide support like the headlines will have you believe . 
  but yes , indians were the example of immigration that was used pre 2000 by the far right , similar but not as bad as how mexicans are caricatured in the us , in the uk . 
  now the emphasis is more on poles and gypsies , although the poles i know do n't seem to care at all because they , and nobody else i know , associates with such people . 
  i think you should give yourself a year or so after university to live and work in europe and then come back home for some time with the family . 
  you can enjoy having some personal time with your friends back home after a year apart and contemplate whether you want to take a more permanent plane ride to england , or stick with life in the usa . 
  but then what do you consider a genetic disorder ? 
  surely some people would say being black is a genetic deficiency which is blatantly absurd . 
  aside from the problem of incorrectly classifying a genetic deficiency and accidentally committing a strange form of genocide , there 's also the problem of the distinction between a real deficiency and normality is very blurry .
