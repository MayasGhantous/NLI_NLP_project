  that 's what we 're doing with space exploration at the moment , only we 're just using telescopes and probes . 
  that 's great . 
  we should do more of this . 
  but eventually , if you want to * really * understand what 's going on there ( which we do ) you need to have permanent bases there . 
  they do n't necessarily have to be staffed by humans ( although there are many benefits to that ) but you do need that infrastructure . 
  the first settlements in the new world were ridiculously expensive , and many of them failed . 
  scotland lost 20 % of its national wealth trying to start a settlement in central america , and was a major cause for the union with england in 1707 . 
  those settlements provided very little of benefit in the immediate decades . 
  it took until later generations for them to be useful . 
  and if we want to truly explore space over the lifetime of the human race , then we need to start building that infrastructure . 
  we can make great scientific discoveries down here on earth , but eventually we 're going to need to start going further . 
  even if we do n't use a moon base , we 're going to need to do a test run to figure out * how * to do bases on non-earth bodies . 
  so that 's the real reason behind it . 
  you have to build infrastructure this generation so you can continue to make more science in the next generation . 
   the british are ` special ' in that they are the indigenous people of the nation and whose livelihood 's are therefore of the most interest to the state which represents the nation . 
  what 's so special about being born here first ? 
  lots of impressive work by the european space agency this year , continuing to prove that investments in space exploration and research in astronomy is always worth the costs . 
  i hope they 'll get more funding in future to expand their missions . 
  something which was n't mentioned in this video was that the esa has a new person in charge [ jan w\u00f6rner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johann-dietrich_w%c3%b6rner ) since july of this year ( 2015 ) . 
  this is kind of a big deal because he is super ambitious . 
  this is the guy that said he wants to [ create a base on the friggin moon ! ] ( http://www.zeit.de/2015/47/johann-dietrich-woerner-esa-raumfahrt ) . 
  and this is n't just hyperbole . 
  the russian and european space agencies have already announced that they 're going to [ co-operate on sending landers to the moon ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34504067 ) in order to assess the viability of a base . 
  that 's some pretty serious money and some pretty serious levels of co-operation , and the guy has only been here for a few months !, 
  if w\u00f6rner achieves even a fraction of what he sets out to achieve , and it 's looking like he will , then i think the esa will be a rival for the world 's best space agency before long . 
  also : [ here 's an interview with w\u00f6rner and the former esa director jean-jacques dordain about their ambitions ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/06/19/esa-chiefs-discuss-building-a-base-on-the-moon-and-visiting-mars/ ) . 
  titanic has my favourite political joke/cartoon ever this was done in the immediate aftermath of the charlie hebdo attacks . 
  there was a lot of pressure on political cartoonists to draw pictures of mohammed , so they made [ this ] ( http://www.titanic-magazin.de/fileadmin/_migrated/pics/01-u1-titel-201502-mohammed_03.jpg ) . 
  ` where is mohammed ? ', 
  the mental image of some terrorist somewhere searching the picture to see if mohammed is depicted , is hilarious . 
  i do n't care who the victim in all this is . 
  the point i 'm trying to hammer home is that lying is bad , and you will be caught out on it . 
  do n't say shit which ai n't true . 
   i did n't read every single one of them . 
  he posted like 20 walls of texts in this thread . 
   i read the ones that were in response to me . 
  that 's a lie . 
  the comment where i said i was playing devil 's advocate , something which you said you did n't read , was the first comment by me in this thread . 
   i 'm genuinely not sure which side of the argument i fall on , but i just wanted to make clear that there 's solid reasons for thinking this should be disallowed . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xy4jp/french_politician_christine_boutin_fined_5000/cy8uwbz --  i 've seen him pull this shit in other threads . 
  he has been getting under my nerves for a while now . 
  and here 's me thinking that you all-of-a-sudden lost respect for me . 
  and may i ask , doing * what * for a while now ? 
  making comments which you disagree with ? 
  what ? 
   edit : by arsed to read i meant all his other posts in the thread it was in my ** first ** comment . 
  no one 's expecting you to read all of them , just the ones in this chain . 
   i 'm genuinely not sure which side of the argument i fall on , but i just wanted to make clear that there 's solid reasons for thinking this should be disallowed . 
  what the fuck dude ? 
  you 're willing to apportion or revoke respect ** without even reading all of one comment ** . 
  dude , that 's stupid . 
  i have no respect for you either . 
  if you 're gon na jude someone and then shout about it , at least fucking try and pay attention . 
  i 've no time anymore for your naval gazing opinions . 
  i think i rustled a lot of jimmies today, 
  is n't one of the key tenets of a free and liberal society thy individuals should exercise reason and critical judgement upon all ideals ? 
  nothing is above criticism . 
  if free speech is so great , which is something you ** and i ** ( although i recognise its limitations also ) both believe , then it should be able to stand up to criticism on its own merits . 
  if freedom of speech is so great , then you should invite criticism of it so that it can demonstrate its greatness . 
  if freedom of speech is so great that it is infallible , then we should prove its infanility through argument . 
  my point is , that if you place freedom of speech on a pedestal and say that it ca n't be criticised , then * you * are the one who is truly disrespecting it . 
  you ca n't believe in freedom of speech whilst also believing that freedom of speech is above criticism . 
  those two positions which you seem to hold are mutually exclusive and , yes , it 's also hypocrisy . 
  given all of this , i think you should seriously re-evaluate what respect means to you . 
  for instance , there are many people across the political spectrum whom i have huge respect for , despite my huge differences . 
  for instance a user here called / u/trucidator ( i think that 's the spelling ) is a proud eurosceptic ( whilst i have almost unwavering support for the european project ) . 
  despite this , he is one of the users here whom i most respect , due to his consistent logic , detail and politeness . 
  there 's also / u/savannajeff who is pro-ttip , which i heavily disagree with due to the environmental impacts , as well as workers ' rights concerns . 
  despite this , i find again that his dedication , reasonableness and detail is impressive and this i have heavy respect for them to . 
  respect is worthless if it 's only given those whom you share opinions with . 
  respect must be more blind than this , just like justice . 
  so i would implore you to critically evaluate again both your unquestioning and counter intuitive beliefs in freedom and also your own perceptions of what respect is and who you give it to . 
  you 've lost a lot of respect for me because i 'm undecided on whether there should be limits to freedom of speech ? 
  dude , i made i clear in my first comment that i 'm undecided on the issue and that im basically playing devil 's advocate . 
  ( it 's a sort of cathartic exercise which helps explore the limits and boundaries of the issue ) . 
  so you lose respect for people who even * question * the utility of freedom of speech ? 
  forgive me for being presumptuous , but that seems incredibly close minded to me . 
  if you ca n't respect somebody who does n't 100 % agree with you on a certain issue , maybe you should question yourself as to why you 're so defensive about it . 
  racist term for jews . 
  the offensiveness level is somewhere between calling a french a frog and a black person a nigger or wog . 
  what 's russia 's national dish ? 
  empty, 
  kinda of sad , seeing as i 've up voted several of the people i 'm arguing with . 
  i 'm not so much worried for my comment score but that it will deter other people in the future from providing interest comments . 
  i 'll keep commenting no matter what , but other people actually care about karma . 
  i am actually broadly in favour of wide ranging discussions and exchanges of views . 
  i 'd like if we could do so here more often . 
  seeing as the counter examples are so obvious , why do n't you give me some ? 
  did you see me bashing paedophiles in my comment ? 
  paedophiles did n't choose their sexual preferences , and as such should be helped not hurt . 
  they 're ordinary human beings who are effectively disabled by their own lusts . 
  they have desires which can never be fulfilled . 
  vilifying them achieves nothing except to ostracise them and turn them into sexual predators . 
   people should be legally able to call out cultures/lifestyles that they do not like or support ( and this certainly goes both ways ) you 're saying homosexuality is a life style ? 
  sorry , i did n't realise i choice who i find attractive . 
  i did n't realise that by liking the genders that i like , that i somehow became a member of a culture . 
  it could n't be , that nether i nor anybody else has any choice over who they find attractive, 
  uuhhhh no . 
  what boutin said is a way of trying to make it look like it was n't hate speech , but it is . 
  it 's like saying `` if you 're black then you 're committing a sin , but if you become white then you 're not committing a sin anymore '' .
