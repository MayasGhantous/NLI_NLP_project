  it 's something homosexual people have no control over . 
  so no , you ca n't just apply hate speech to everything . 
  you can call a dog a cat , and some people will , but calling a dog a cat does n't make it one . 
  likewise , calling something which is n't hate speech hate speech does n't make it hate speech . 
  that 's why you have courts and definitions and long pieces of legislation . 
  and lastly : even if we ca n't do something 100 % effectively , you 're saying we should to entirely in the opposite direction and just allow all of it ? 
  like , we ca n't catch all murders without arresting some innocent people , so we should stop arresting guilty people as well because we may arrest one innocent person ? 
  because that 's the argument you 're making . 
  we ca n't stop all hate speech without infringing on some non hate speech ( i do n't think this is true ; paraphrasing you ) therefore we should allow all hate speech . 
  i can see where you 're coming from but i disagree . 
  i think that we should attempt to find a balance and fine tune the system over long periods of time to stamp out hate speech . 
  we can do it and we should . 
  that 's not really the point of free speech . 
  the point of free speech ( according to john stuart mill , at least ) is to create a ` free market if ideas ' where the best ideas naturally rise to the top and the worst to the bottom . 
  the thing is , this only really applies to actually logical arguments , which hate speech is n't . 
  hate speech is usually guided exclusively or largely by emotion rather than logic , so it 's quite easy to cut out those sorts of speeches without effecting the * principles * of freedom of speech . 
  and i think that saying calling for violence is the point where speech becomes action is too simplistic . 
  there 's lots of speech which doesnt directly call for violence but still has actions . 
  for instance , calling for discrimination on a personal level has effects between individuals , even if you 're not explicitly calling for violence . 
  -- for the muslim thing , i do n't know why you 're bringing it up . 
  that 's an equality before the law debate ( rather than a freedom of speech debate ) . 
  obviously we should all be equal before the law . 
  but that 's not the issue here . 
  so let 's not use this as another opportunity to discuss islam . 
  you can do that in almost any other thread , any day of the week . 
  there 's no need to turn every issue into it . 
  well , because of all the things i said after that comment : distinction between speech and action , singling people out for things they ca n't control , hate rather than logic , free speech fundamentalism verses commitment to profiles of free speech, 
   the article imposes on the reader , that every change will be bad/evil/authoritarian . 
  what if opposite will be true ? 
  you keep making dw.de out to be some evil , propagandist outlet . 
  it actually never calls pis authoritarian . 
  all the readers are capable of looking at the facts and making our own minds up . 
   there was n't even any bill to quote from . 
  because there are n't any ( they got only plans for it ) . 
  because parliamentary bills are not published until the latest possible opportunity . 
  virtually all countries do this . 
  it 's to avoid the bills getting attention by giving people less time to learn about them . 
  so yes . 
  they 're just plans . 
  plans that will directly lead to legislation ** this coming january ** . 
  are you admitting that these are bad plans and that they should n't go through with them ? 
  surely , you do n't need to bring up other irrelevant facts of the legislation is good in the first place / s, 
  hmm , i do n't know . 
  publicly calling an integral part of someone 's sexuality ` an abomination ' is pretty hateful . 
  like , should someone be able to say that men or women are an abomination ? 
  what about people with different skin colours ? 
  my point is that your sexuality is part of your identity , like your skin colour and gender . 
  so is it okay to be explicitly hateful towards people for things they ca n't change ? 
  there could certainly be long term negative societal implications based on her words alone . 
  it will change the way individuals approach homosexual individuals and further ostracise homosexual people from wider society . 
  these are negative , quantifiable results of simple speech . 
  the boundary between speech and action is often not as clear cut as you might think . 
  hate speech usually crosses that line between reasoned debate which is hypothetical , and a direct call to action . 
  and doing so is especially unfair when people have no choice on their sexuality , and then must face real world consequences because of what people like this have said i 'm not sure where i stand on it . 
  but i do know that hate speech is different to ordinary speech . 
  spewing bile and hatred is different to explaining a logical argument . 
  this individual could have quite easily pushed whatever policy she wants to push * without * using hateful language to a large section of the population who have no choice in their circumstances . 
  you can retain general freedom of speech without allowing hate speech . 
  you do n't need a dogmatic acceptance of all consuming free speech , so long as you 're true to its general principles : which is the ` free market of ideas ' . 
  i 'm genuinely not sure which side of the argument i fall on , but i just wanted to make clear that there 's solid reasons for thinking this should be disallowed . 
  edit : please do n't down vote based on opinion . 
  check reddiquette . 
  because it 's planning to do huge , authoritaria changes to the media . 
  that 's the story . 
  that 's what the article is about . 
  it 's a report on what is ** happening ** now not what has happened . 
  that 's why it 's an ** article ** but not a book . 
  thanks, 
  that does n't really explain why you 're bringing this up . 
  this just an article , not a book . 
  it 's supposed to give a reasonable picture of what 's happening now , not give an overview of what happened over the last decade . 
  if you want that , read a book and stop expecting articles to be something they 're not, 
  feels like you ca n't really blame syriza for greece 's plight at this point . 
  by the time new democracy , pasok * and * syriza have all had a go at trying to govern the country since the financial crash in 2008 and * non * of them have been able to do much of anything good , it feels like you ca n't really say that any specific one of them is responsible ( except maybe the ones who started it , but the blame game for that goes back decades ) . 
  erm , you 're kind of right , but it 's more because my example is bad . 
  you 're correct that in english we use `` they '' when it 's the subject of the sentence and `` them '' when it 's the objective ( or a dative ) of a sentence . 
  however , that 's not what i was trying to express . 
  as far as i am concerned ` they ' and ` them ' are the same word , but conjugated differently ; the same way ` am ' ` is ' and ` are ' are all the same word ( ` to be ' ) but conjugated depending on whether it 's the first , second or third person ( i , you , it ) . 
  so that 's why i used ` them ' in one example but ` they ' in another . 
  i think they 're the same word . 
  i should n't have done this because it makes the example over complicated . 
  so it 's my fault for any confusion . 
  anyway , your list of examples do further prove the actual point that we 're both trying to make , which is that ` they/them ' can be used k situations where you wish to be gender neutral , as evidenced by re fact that all of your examples are ( quite rightly ) gender neutral . 
  true , although my example could still work . 
  for instance , somebody could say `` my friend gave me this wonderful box of chocolates for christmas ! '', 
  to which i may respond `` they are a nice person '' . 
  this is because the word ` friend ' in english is ungendered . 
  side note : interestingly this problem does n't exist in some other languages , like german , because all nouns are clearly gendered , so that you 're seldom in doubt . 
  for instance , in german the word ` friend ' is either ` freund ' ( masculine ) or ` freundin ' ( feminine ) . 
  so if somebody said ` meine freund ** in ** hat mir eine wundersch\u00f6ne bonboniere gegeben ' then i could reply with ` sie ist eine sehr h\u00f6fliche person ' ( * she * is a nice person ) . 
  i think the fourth if july in the usa was to some degree inspired by guy fawkes night in the uk, 
  no that 's the same . 
  they has two means . 
  one is * third person plural : e.g , `` all of them are nice people '' . 
  this usage is obviously different to ` hen ' * third person singular : eg `` they are a nice person '' . 
  this is synonymous with saying `` he/she is a nice person '' and is also directly synonymous with the definition of ` hen ' in swedish that you gave . 
  i 've got to say , i 'm sure there must be a link between the two celebrations . 
  i mean , 4th if july is the closest thing we have to a national day , except maybe saint george 's day or the queen 's birthday , neither of which are celebrate . 
  do n't worry about it . 
  with these sorts of celebrations , the myth is as important as the fact .
