  i 'm not sure where the individual who this quote originates from stands on the issue . 
  i would imagine that the facilities are n't that separate , which is why this is an issue . 
  they 'll likely be in different wards , but that means that male and female rape victims could likely come into contact with each other . 
  it makes sense to have a greater physical difference , assuming there 's potential psychologic ramifications . 
  i 've got a question : what is actually * at stake * in this election ? 
  like , i know that there is the possibility of either psoe or pp becoming the major governing party ( although probably with support of smaller parties ) but i do n't know what they 're actually planning to do . 
  what could we see * change * because of this election ? 
  my main interests are probably spain 's situation in the eu , ( i.e. 
  do we know how a new government will procedure with the greek debt crisis , and the refugee crisis ? ), 
  and also catalonia . 
  maybe also regarding gibraltar  and , do any of them have serious economic reforms ? 
  i imagine that pp is in favour of the status quo , whilst c 's is in favour of more neo-liberal policies , and psoe would be in favour of * very , very mild * shifts towards more state regulation ? 
  do they want to nationalise anything ? 
  this is all guesswork based on what i see happening in other european countries ( including my own ) so i could be entirely wrong . 
  -- edit : unrelated , but did the leader of the socialists * seriously * only become leader of the party last year ? 
  wow , no wonder he is being accused of superficiality . 
  there 's no way you can get a feel for running an entire political party in such a short amount of time . 
  if you include the full , non editorialised , title of the article * first * then i think we 'd be okay with users providing a short summary as well , so long as it is representative of the article ( non editorialised ) . 
  making definitive rules on editorialising is really difficult as its often subjective . 
  so , so long as you make efforts to be true to the original article then you 'll generally be fine . 
  anyway , glad that you 're making the effort to follow rules . 
  it makes our job so much easier . 
  so i thank you , genuinely  merry christmas sly, 
  yes , but i think the point is that forcing an individual who has been ( potentially repeatedly ) raped to be surrounded by those who are capable of similar things can be psychologically problematic , at a very sensitive time . 
  i can see benefits to keeping men and women who have been recently abused separate . 
  however , i 'm no psychologist so i 'm not decisively coming down on one side or the other . 
  i 'm saying that there may be good reasons for what that person is saying and that we should keep an open mind until the psychologists do give their verdict, 
  i think what martel means is that the bretons see themselves as having a strong celtic heritage , and the republic of ireland is somewhat the role model of a celtic nation . 
  ( the uk , otoh , is much more dominated by anglosaxons ) . 
  so bretagne and bretons often try and emulate ireland . 
  not sure if right place but ... what wines would you recommend ? 
  like , if i wanted to get an authentic experience ( not especially good or bad , just authentic ) of casually enjoying a wine , as you do in france , what would you recommend ? 
  which brand should i import ? 
  what should i drink it with ? 
  do you have to prepare the wine beforehand in anyway ? 
  sincerely , a brit,

  well , actually : if you look back at the uk 's previous referendum on the then european community , the ( labour/s & d ) pm harold wilson won an election on the grounds that he would renegotiate and then hold referendum . 
  what actually happened in that referendum was that he got virtually non of his ` demands ' met ( just like 9 out of 10 of cameron 's ` demands ' have not been met so far ) except for the some pointless exception on imports of cheese ( or some other small product ) from new zealand . 
  despite this , wilson * still * refused to campaig for ` out ' and consequently the ` in ' campaign won , just like cameron is likely going to campaign for ` in ' it 's really 1975 all over again , in a lot of ways . 
  actually , it * is * cameron 's best bet of guaranteeing a victory if he does it sooner rather than later . 
  support of the ` out ' vote has risen steadily over time , as ukip have dominated the airwaves and the disorganised ` in ' campaign has had little ability to protest . 
  additionally , it is a safe bet that there * will * be another headline grabbing eu event some time during next summer . 
  whether that 's another wave of the migration crisis , the eu assuming more power in order to deal with it ( which will be seen as a potential infringement on state sovereignty ) or the greek debt crisis or anything really . 
  it 's best to get the thing sorted out as soon as possible , especially whilst the two ` out ' campaigns are n't really formed and are n't really sure who their leaders are . 
  the daily telegraph 's ( which is one of the uk 's four top broadsheet newspapers , alongside the guardian , the independent and the times ) entire political team has put their names to this article , so i think it carries some weight . 
  cameron himself has explicitly said that he wants it in june , and this would make since , given that he may be afraid that the two ` out ' campaigns will have more of a chance to catch air time of he leaves it longer and there may be a second wave of the migrant crisis this summer , or some other headline grabbing event ( such as the eu accumulating more power/reducing state sovereignty in order to adequately deal with the crisis ) . 
  it would also make sense to not give much warning before the referendum , as this allows cameron to set the stage and keep his adversaries off guard . 
  bear in mind that this is the man who has already held two referendums ( alternative vote referendum 2010 and scottish referendum 2014 ) and won both times . 
  -- edit1 : [ politico.eu corroborates this ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/cameron-wants-a-referendum-soon-membership-eu-brexit-without-kids/ )  the prime minister 's hopes for a quick referendum , possibly in ** june or september 2016 ** ,, 
  polls put it at about 50/50 ( iirc it was about 30 % for in , and 30 % for out , with about 40 % undecided ) . 
  there 's still ** everything ** to play for in this referendum . 
  there 's no room for complacency, 
  interesting . 
  so , why would you say that he 's * not * an idiot ( as you said in a previous comment ) ? 
  these all seem like pretty crazy things to have done and to bekjer . 
  unrelated : but would you say that antidemitism is common amongst polls ? 
  virtually all the poles i 've met so far ( not a lot ) have been the sorts of people that i avoid mentioning my jewish heritage to . 
  it seems interesting that this defence minister has similar views, 
  that 's because life has an anti-pis bias, 
  source ? 
  i do n't think that 's mentioned in the article ( but i could be wrong ), 
  in this comment chain : lots of opinions , not much discussion . 
  either of you have evidence for/against this macierewicz 's competence/idiocy ? 
  i 'd love to know why he ( specifically ) seems so divisive . 
  is he a well known figure ? 
  or is this just because he is a member of the governing pis party , which is very divisive ? 
  yeah , it 's usually a coin toss as to whether the comments section or the actual article will be of higher quality/more information rich . 
  and at least skimming an article will much more easily allow you to detect the bullshit comments . 
  still , there 's so many articles you cant possibly read them all : / so it 's hard to prioritise what is worth reading . 
  i agree with the legislation and everything , but could you expand on that comparison a bit more ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  i read german and french media when i can and usually go to those media when i see german or french speaking countries being reported on in the english speaking press . 
  it basically showed me that ** more than not , english speaking media will significantly misreport news from foreign countries ** . 
  one of the reasons i 'm aiming to be a journalist in a non uk european country is precisely to rectify this imballance , but so long as it exists , you should treat all english reporting of the abroad with heavy suspicion . 
  even supposedly reputable sources like bloomberg * on the front page right now * is being significantly misleading , like this guardian article . 
  i mean , it 's certainly going in a more progressive * direction * ( recently allowing same sex marriage , and abortion iirc ) whilst the uk seems to be regressing ( euroref , planning to water down human rights act , increasing surveillance , cutting green subsidies ) . 
  but i think you 're totally right that overall the uk is still a more progressive place , with an overall more progressive government , than ireland . 
  the links with hard line catholicism are weakening and catholicism itself is becoming less regressive ( making divorce easier ) but that does n't stop catholicism still being very regressive and the societal links with it being extremely strong . 
  it was n't an official nato facility , but it was * for * nato and largely staffed * by * nato . 
  it 's a pretty but slap in the face to all of poland 's partners to just fuck with it , without even warning . 
  plug for / r/europemeta, 
  what that singer said was not merely conservative , it was saying that women should ` belong to someone . ', 
  i do n't care if it 's conservative ; it 's the epitome of misogyny . 
  wait ...
