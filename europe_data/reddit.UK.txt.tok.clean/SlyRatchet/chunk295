  interestingly , [ amnesty international is taking the uk government to court over this violation ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/04/amnesty-international-takes-uk-government-to-european-court-of-human-rights-over-mass-surveillance/ ) . 
  interestingly ... amnesty would not be able to do this if the uk were not a party to the european convention on human rights ( because the echr protects individuals ` right to privacy ' ) . 
  * solidifying anti-terror legislation * having huge cuts to legal aid , so that many individuals are incapable of legally defending themselves in court . 
   in syria and iraq for recent examples of this just for posterity 's sake : almost everything the western powers + russia are doing in syria and iraq is legal . 
  all of the western air strikes against daesh in iraq are legal , because iraq invited us in . 
  turkey is legally allowed to fight daesh because its territory was attacked by daesh and co. . russia is legally allowed to due to the fact assad invited russia to . 
  and the incoming involvement by usa , uk , german and france is legal due to a un resolution which was created and ratified in the aftermath of the paris attacks , which justifies international involvement . 
  it 's not useless . 
  it has no ability to force the one of the five permanent members of the unsc ( usa , russia , china , france and the uk ) to do something they do n't want . 
  that is true . 
  the un is unhelpful in that regard . 
  however , that is far from being ` useless ' . 
  it has many other functions . 
  two primarily stick out to me . 
  * facilitating co-operation and humanitarian actions which are largely ** non-political ** . 
  this is ** huge ** and should itself be broken down into sub categories such as : 1 . 
  health and disease : the [ world health organisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_health_organization ) played a leading roll in ** eradicating [ small box ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smallpox#eradication ) ** and in tackling the ** [ ebola epidemic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ebola_virus_epidemic_in_west_africa ) ** in west africa ( use cmd + f for ` world health organization ' or ` who ' and you 'll find it 's mentioned almost 300 times in that wikipedia article ) . 
  climate change : you know the kyoto agreement as well as the newly finalised paris agreement which are just about the only thing slowing our descent towards a horrific plane crash of environmental catastrophe for life on this planet ? 
  they would not be possible without the un , and are currently administered by the [ united nations framework convention on climate change ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_framework_convention_on_climate_change ) . 
  it ai n't great , but it 's all we got . 
  famine : the [ world food programme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_food_programme ) is a un agency responsible for providing emergency relief in disasters zones and for poorer countries which are having difficulties feeding their populations . 
  the number of lives which have been saved , as well as the quality of life , are difficult to quantify . 
  4 . there 's many more which could be listed , but these are just the most important ones to me . 
  the world bank and international monetary fund and the whole world of interconnected markets is part of the un framework as well , as are regulations on the use of space , and exploration of antarctica , and protection of human rights . 
  * the second major thing i 'd like to bring up , is that the un is actually relatively effective at dealing with political crisis ( like war ) which do not majorly involve the five great powers ( usa , china , russia , france , uk ) and even some conflicts which do . 
  for instance , a recent un resolution which was passed following the paris attacks allows for an international response to fight in syria . 
  this is why a lot of countries , such as france and germany and the uk , are mobilising for heavy involvement in syria * now * rather than before . 
  there 's moral outrage by europeans , yes , but also this un resolution means that waging war in syria against daesh would be * legal * in the eyes of international law . 
  the toppling of gadaffi in libya was similar . 
  the un security council passed a motion allowing the air campaign . 
  interestingly , the iraq war led by the united states + uk was * not * legal in the eyes of international law , and so did not feature large scale involvement from european allies such as france and germany . 
  in the end these become [ peace keeping missions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_nations_peacekeeping_missions ) of which the un facilitates many across the globe today , and many more historically . 
  * the third major point is that the un helps * facilitated * a sense of * det\u00e8nte * ( or , relaxation/de-stressing/entspannung ) between the powerful states . 
  for instance , major treaties such as [ the nuclear non proliferation treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_non-proliferation_of_nuclear_weapons ) which prohibits the creation or advancement of new nuclear weapons technologies is a un treaty , which would likely not have been possible without it , and featured the signatures of all of the five un security council members . 
  same thing with the un [ chemical weapons convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemical_weapons_convention ) . 
  - but to expand on this more generally , i think that having direct lines of communication with * every other nation on earth * has a huge impact on the way states behave . 
  what happened in the second world war was that basically all communication between the allies and the axis powers was routed through switzerland , but this meant that coming to any sort of compromise short of total destruction of one of the competitors was basically impossible . 
  today , delegates are forced too often to actually talk to other nations which tends to lead towards compromise . 
  ( sorry this last point is n't as well flashed out as the others , but is is a * far more * complicated and nuanced pov , so , not as easy to explain in a single paragraph : / ) the reason that you never really hear about this side of the un , this incredible amazing side of the un , is that fighting diseases and feeding the world 's poorest , starving people just does n't generate headlines like `` war in syria ! '', 
  or `` iranian nuclear stockpiles ! '' . 
  negativity sells newspapers and generates website traffic , and it 's easy to sell the narrative that because the war in syria is awful or because russia invaded east ukraine that clearly international co-operation has failed . 
  but that 's not the case . 
  international co-operation is alive and well and accelerating . 
  in 1915 there were * 30 * international organisations in 1945 , but by 1990 there were over 1,000 , and it has likely risen even further since . 
  and what is the lynch pin which makes all of this international co-operation possible ? 
  what is the framework , without which this could not take place ? 
  what is the forum where these agreements are made ? 
  it 's a rhetorical question , but i 'll answer it anyway : the united nations . 
  tl ; dr the united nations is pretty good , because of the world health organisation , the un 's role in alleviating climate change , the un 's role in alleviating famine around the world , amongst other things ; its ability to force the rule of international law in states which are not one of the five members of the unsc ; and also because being in constant communication with each other makes war and animosity more difficult , even for the big five nations . 
  this is a really bad tl ; dr.

  depends at what time you count it . 
  for most of their histories , the uk was obviously the more developed of the two , but leading up to the first world war germany and austria-hungary started industrialising hugely ( although germany 's industrialisation was far more extensive ) to the point where i 'd say german empire + austria hungary was more developed than the british empire , especially if you include german territorial possessions outside europe . 
  but this was an extremely brief period of time . 
  for most of the time before this the uk had far more industrialisation , and after the versailles treaty , ensuing hyperinflation , disillusion of austria hungary , reparations , etc. . . british empire was more developed again after the first world war too, 
  okay ... why is that relevant to * this * conversation ? 
   ... what ? 
  why are you turning this into an opportunity to shit on * `` modern '' * feminism ? 
  / u/mike _ blomkvist said nothing about it . 
  for all you know they could be a misogynist ...

  there was a funny phenomenon in uk political conferences for the various parties a few years ago . 
  labour and the conservatives started competing for who 's audience could get the longest applause . 
  so every year it would get longer and longer . 
  i ca n't remember how long it got before they called it quits, 
  sheffield is about halfway through such a project . 
  all the main traffic roads have led lights + solar panels on them , but not residential roads yet . 
  should be done in a few years . 
  it 's very nice . 
  you can see the stars clearly at night now , where before you were lucky if a single star was visible . 
  and even then it was usually just an airplane . 
  usually when i see british people talking about mmp i just assume they 're talking about the scottish system , which has two separate votes per person ( one national and one local ) . 
  sorry for the confusion !, 
  i also could n't remember the vote numbers for anybody but the conservatives so i just played it vague and said * more than 20 * . 
  thanks for the information - useful, 
  there 's also the german system , where you have one vote for your local mp on a first past the post typed system , but then after all the constituency seats are done , a bunch of mps who are n't connected to constituencies are created to make sure that the votes nationally match the parliamentary seats . 
  so if this was implemented in the uk 2015 election , and everyone voted the same way , you 'd get the same 300 odd conservative mps ( 50 % of the total ) with 37 % of the vote . 
  then , all of the parties that lost out in that election ( especially the greens , ukip and the lib dems ) would get extra seats . 
  so instead of the greens and ukip getting one mp each , they 're more likely to get something like 10 or 20 floating mps without constituencies . 
  apart from that 's not what i said , or believe . 
  what i said was that i am against conscription in principle , for men and women . 
  if i lived in a country with conscription , abolishing it altogether would be quite high on my list . 
  and a partrage in a pear tree, 
  as feminist ... yeah it is progress for gender equality ... but it 's somewhat regressive for society as a whole due to how much of a restriction of freedom it is ( and what 's the point of gender equality if you 're not a free human being ? ) . 
  so yes and no . 
  yes . 
  i am a feminist and am against conscription , which is why i do n't bother arguing for equal conscription . 
  obviously it should be equal . 
  it 's just not something i spent a lot of time talking about , because there 's bigger issues that i spend time on . 
  and for the retirement thing : yes , that should also be equal . 
  sorry to disappoint everyone for not living up to their stereotypes of what questions feminist is, 
  can confirm .
