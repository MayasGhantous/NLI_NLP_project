  we 're basically the illuminati, 
  i 've just been clicking around all the links : it turns out this is based on a specific wording of one of the treaties . 
  it is certainly open to legal challenge in the european court of justice ( which interprets the eu constitution ) . 
  many national diplomats interpreted the treaty as simplifying allowing for frontex to exist like it does to today , as an organisation focused simply in coordinating national border agencies where as the european commission believes that it gives the eu power to implement its own supranational border agency . 
  this is certainly a very interesting development . 
  interested to see where it leads, 
  ummm ... no . 
  every uk politician ever = / = ukip . 
  it may surprise you to know that most people actually dislike ukip, 
  here 's some figures . 
  the total number of deaths in this conflict is estimated to be [ 220,000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_civil_war ) total , including civilians killed by all sides , and soldiers from all sides . 
  additionally , 4 million ( 4,000,000 ) refugees and 7.6 million ( 7,600,000 ) internally displaced people ( i.e. 
  refugees who have not left the country ) . 
  it may be interesting to note , that daesh ( aka isis ) are n't actually the biggest killers in the syrian civil war . 
  assad has that accolade . 
  [ washington post analysis ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/islamic-state-has-killed-many-syrians-but-assads-forces-have-killed-even-more/2015/09/05/b8150d0c-4d85-11e5-80c2-106ea7fb80d4_story.html ) measured that death toll over a period of time , and figured out that  `` between january and july , assad 's military and pro-government militias killed 7,894 people , while the ~ ~ islamic state ~ ~ * daesh * killed 1,131 , according to the syrian network for human rights '' -- the best way to think of this war is * that it 's fascists on the government side ( assad and saddam hussein both followed [ ba'athism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ba%27athism ) , which is a secular arab nationalist ideology which many commentators have compared with the fascism of adolf hitler and benito mussolini ) who are fighting against * violent jihadist [ that 's daesh , who follow the [ wahhabi school of islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabism ) ( which interestingly , so does saudi arabia ... ) ] who are both also fighting * a different group violent jihadist wahhabis [ that 's the [ al nusra front ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-nusra_front ) , who are a branch of al qaeda . 
  yes , * that * al qaeda ] . 
  * and if this three sided war was n't bad enough , you * also * have a regionalist group in the corner of the country fighting for their independence [ that 's [ the kurds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan ) , the same ones who were genocided in iraq under saddam hussein ] . 
  * and finally , ** finally ** , you have the [ free syrian army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_syrian_army ) ... which is basically a hodge bodge of various anti-government , anti-daesh forces , which includes pro-western liberals , but the al nusra front ( violent jihadists ) is * also * a member . 
  add into all this , suddenly you have russia , turkey and the west all joining in , each with their own interests and each disagreeing on what the end goal is and non of whom agree on who the good guys are ( russia thinks assad is the good guy , the west thinks that the free syrian army are the good guys , and turkey thinks that everyone is shit , but the kurds are the shittest of all ) . 
  you 've got ta keep in mind again that a court cases do n't necessarily correlate with the number of crimes . 
  it 's like the number of prosecutions for weed possession in the uk has almost no bearing on how many people illegally smoke and distribute weed . 
  it 's like how jeremy corbyn called for women only carriages to combat uk society being * increasingly * aggressive towards females , in light of the rise in the number of instances of female harassment at train stations ... only there had been * no * rise in the amount of harassment , but instead simply a rise in reporting of it ( which is good , and actually a sign that uk society is taking female harassment more seriously than it was previously ) . 
  -- interpreting statistics is a fine science . 
  you can almost never base it solely off of reported instances . 
  you 'll only ever have part of the picture from the data you have available , and from that data you need to * infer * the rest . 
  ^ ( for those of you who are desperately trying to figure out whether i 'm saying there 's a lot of muslim extremists or not a lot so you can decide whether to down vote me or not , go bugger off . 
  that 's not what i am trying to do . 
  i 'm simply talking about the difficulties in interpreting data , and demonstrating that neither / u/tristag 's nor / u/therufmeistergeneral 's ways of estimating the proportion of extremists in the netherlands is particularly great . ), 
   but you anglos give us enough shit for losing ww2 -  why the double standard ? 
  it may shock you to find out , that not all english people are of one mind . 
  we 're actually a nation of 50 million people , and some of us have our own opinions . 
  -- anyway , i do n't see why you should let a bunch of english nationalists who enjoy over simplifying history determine what french foreign policy is . 
  surely you should base it off of what would achieve french interests , and create the best outcome for humanity , rather than what would make france look good in the eyes of hypocrites abroad . 
  i wonder which is the poorest eu country . 
  my money 's on bulgaria , lithuania or latvia ( in that order ) . 
  you 're right to query the numbers . 
  it 's not an insubstantial amount . 
  the main consumer of european funding into fusion power is the iter project , which is forecast to cost 15 billion euros over it 's 35 year life time ( although estimates have been increased over time ) of which 45 % will come from the european union . 
  this is not including various other projects , such as the wendelstein one , which is the subject of the op . 
  at this point , i would n't want to shut down the iter project because it 's already so far through its construction and i do absolutely acknowledge the longterm value of fusion , and scientific research . 
  the huge scientific loss to future generations would be enormous if we were to cut the project now . 
  alongside this , we also need to more generally increase funding in other forms of research ( such as astronomy , through the european space agency ) . 
  -- fortunately , the green vision has no problems squaring all these circles . 
  the main threat to our planet and the people on it is overconsumption of fossil fuels . 
  there 's two ways to solve this problem a ) switch to similar products which do not burn fossil fuels ( e.g. 
  electric cars instead of petrol cars , solar power instead of coal fired plants ) and/or b ) consume less . 
  obviously we want to do a as much as possible , but rapid technology research , development and implementation can only get us so far given the small time scale we have . 
  but the the solution to b is actually incredibly clever , as it strikes two birds with one stone . 
  if you raise taxes on those luxuries goods which most contribute to climate change , you can both raise money to fund technological research and implementation of renewable technologies * whilst also discouraging excessive use of carbon intensive products * . 
  it 's also especially economically just because most personal carbon emissions in western countries are produced by the top 1 % , the sort of people who work in london but have weekend homes in barcelona that they fly to and from 104 times a year ( 52 weeks a year , one flight there , one flight back per week ) . 
  this means that you can * progressively tax air usage * so that on your first flight for that year , you pay no tax , your second 10 % , third 20 % and so on . 
  so not only would taxes like this reduce emissions * and * fund the research and technological shifts in the rest of society but they would also increase levels of financial equality which has [ numerous social benefits ] ( https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resources/the-spirit-level ) . 
  we really do have the means to achieve all of this without much sacrifice . 
  the only challenge is showing people that it 's possible . 
  i think that point b is a pretty valid point of view ( although you are taking it to an extreme ) . 
  we have a very short amount of time to reduce our emissions to sustainable levels and avoid locking in massive climate change . 
  as for point a , i think that you 're mixing extremist minorities with the moderate whole . 
  i 'm not denying that * some * environmentalists and environmentalist organisations are stupid . 
  some definitely are . 
  but because a stupid person supports something is * not * a good reason to discredit the whole idea . 
  that 's like saying hitler was a vegetarian ergo vegetarians are bad . 
  it does n't follow . 
  moderate environmentalists as well as crazy ones have reservations about spending money on fusion research . 
  focus on the actually reasonable arguments and not the crazies . 
  all it takes is one really good argument to prove that something is worth doing , and i think point b is that argument ( especially in the way i explained it in my above comment ) . 
  because they fled their own country to avoid being killed by daesh ... 
  it 'd be pretty cruel to then send them to exactly the thing they were running from . 
  that 's just kind of insulting ... 
  the green movement is based around the idea of sustainable economic growth . 
  do you think that we can keep producing and exporting more physical products on a planet with finite resources ? 
  do you think that our current levels of consumption are compatible with fighting global climate change ? 
  the obvious answer to both is * no * . 
  there was a window of opportunity between the 1980s and the 2000 's where we * could * have achieved a technical solution to climate change without * any * reduction in living standards , but our levels of global consumption have risen so drastically and our research and implementation of climate friendly technology so limited that this option is no longer available to us without allowing our planet 's temperature to increase to the 2 degrees c where long term global warming would be ` locked in ' . 
  nobody is asking for global suicide . 
  what the green parties say is that the amount of luxuries we have today are excessive , especially when you keep in mind the industrialisation of countries like china ( which is already amongst the world 's largest polluters ) and other developing countries * and * their horrifically poor environmental standards . 
  keeping in mind as well , that their economic boom is based * on exports to europe and the rest of the west * . 
  it 's our consumption which is driving china 's boom and associated mass pollution . 
  that 's one of the main reasons that consumption in the west has to be linked to global climate change , even if european countries produce relatively few emissions themselves . 
  the various green parties * are mixed on the issue . 
  most greens ( especially uk greens , which is my area of expertise ) are fine with fusion power . 
  it 's just that we think it will take far too long to test , develop , manufacture and get to a workable stage . 
  that 's a lot of money and time . 
  on the other hand , renewable sources of energy offer a lot of the benefits ( zero/low carbon emissions , sustainable , reliable ) and can be built ** today ** because ** the technology already exists and has been implemented on a large scale in several countries ( especially germany ) . 
  given that we have such a small and quickly shrinking window of opportunity to deal with the climate crisis , we ca n't afford to wait 20 years for nuclear fusion to be developed and implemented when there are already such good options on the table . 
  every euro spent on fusion is a euro which could be spent on europe 's ailing renewables budget . 
  i 'm not saying fusion is n't amazing . 
  it is . 
  i think we should develop it and implement it over the next century . 
  but in the next 35 years , we need to be implementing renewables across the board . 
  edit : for reference , here 's a [ link to an ama by the green party of england and wales ' energy spokesperson saying their position on fusion and fission ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3r6zq0/ama_with_cllr_andrew_cooper_here_at_1500_gmt_get/cwlmfnd ) * edit : forgive me lord for i hath sinned ... 
  i hath said `` party 's '' when i meant `` parties '', 
   david cameron is pro-eu he 's not really pro-eu . 
  he 's said explicitly several times that he will support the `` out '' campaign if the uk is n't given op outs . 
  that 's not exactly a ringing endorsement of the european project , now is it ? 
  he 's not europhilic or eurosceptic , but euroindifferent . 
  what i would be interested in is how often western aircraft make such incursions into russia , or russian allied airspace . 
  when this comes up , i see a few users saying `` yeah but the west is constantly testing their airspace too '' and i 'd just really like to know the facts on this . 
  -- if both sides are doing it ( in equal quantities ) then maybe there 's hope for a diplomatic solution of some kind to help reach a detente . 
  i agree very much .
