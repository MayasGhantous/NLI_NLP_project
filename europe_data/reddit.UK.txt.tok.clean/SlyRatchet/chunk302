  and obviously hoc usa wins in terms of quantity too . 
  i mean , each episode is high in quality , so more high quality episodes is just a good thing in my opinion . 
  -- all that said , i do enjoy one small aspect of the uk version more than the us version . 
  that is , that the political stuff is more accurate . 
  in the us version , you can kind of * feel * that it was n't written for the us political system . 
  the thing with the primaries in the most recent season is not that well produced in comparison to the rest of the show . 
  that 's because primaries do n't exist in the uk ( or at least , they did n't until very recently ) and so the us writers of hoc had to completely make up their own stuff and it did n't work out especially well ( imo ) . 
  it was n't * bad * but it was n't up to the same high standards as the rest of the show . 
  and the ultimate jewel in the crown for the uk version is to play a king . 
  it could take place in almost no other country and is just very true to the genuine path that such a crisis would play out , and is obviously highly based off of the current members of our royal family ( especially prince charles ) which just makes it all the more fascinating . 
  same thing we 've [ starving out ireland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3rmg5u/an_giant_effigy_of_david_cameron_holding_a_pig/cwpv6uv?context=3 ) . 
  we 've all been there . 
  no point denying it . 
  i watched the english version of house of cards . 
  it 's alright , but it 's got nothing on the american version . 
  it probably would have been amazing if you were watching it at the time when it came out . 
  still , i watched the entire show ( all four seasons , iirc ) so it 's alright  i found the thick of it a bit more ... boring . 
  it just seems like a lot of swearing to me . 
  fun to put on in the background , but i always lost interest if i watched it directly . 
  not exactly a * drama * but ` yes , minister ' is my favourite political tv programme . 
  it 's essentially a comedy programme , but also has a lot of really interesting insights into politics . 
  when i did my a-level i watched this and it actually really helped . 
  it 's also * amazingly * current , in that a lot of the content is still relevant today . 
  like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe ) segment on nuclear weapons . 
  or this one on [ leading questions ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/g0zzjxw4mta/mqdefault.webp ) in surveys . 
  and the best one about [ europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvrn-gkzvyi ), 
  i think that 's just victim blaming . 
  yeah , it is in the company 's interests to artificially lower their tax burden through subsidiary companies based out of luxembourg , ireland , gibraltar , etc. 
  but it does n't * justify * them doing it . 
  it 's still wrong . 
  what 's even more wrong , is deliberately avoiding paying tax in a country and then posting on twitter about how `` all our thoughts and prayers are with our french friends and their families and all the people of france '' . 
  you ca n't be thinking very much of the people of france if you 're simultaneously cheating them out of billions if not tens of billions of euros which could go towards actually helping french people . 
  the whole thing is so hypocritical . 
  you ca n't score points for being thoughtful whilst also enjoying the fruits of tax evasion . 
  care to give me an elevator pitch for why it 's worth watching ? 
  nothing for i am an uncultured swine :( i feel really bad , because i 've not been able to find any or tv shows that i like from germany , austria , france or belgium . 
  and i have n't found any bands i like for them either , except for germany .

  yeah , but that 's what a lot of other pro-choice people i know do . 
  they just refuse to acknowledge that the ` pro-life ' side has any leg to stand on . 
  it 's mostly due to debates about at which trimester a foetus is consider to be a baby , but that is , as you say , just * imagining the issue away * . 
  so , i 'm not really a fan at all of arguing that a foetus is not a baby on one day , but the next day it is ( and therefore you ca n't abort ) . 
  it just does n't make logical or moral sense to me . 
   even as someone that 's pro-choice , i see it as more of a necessary evil than a plainly good thing . 
  i agree with this . 
  i describe myself as a feminist , am heavily pro-choice , but i still do n't * like * abortions . 
  like , if you imagine all the abortions that go on in the uk ( where abortion is legal ) but imagine that instead of them being in the womb , they have already been born , it becomes really hard to stomach . 
  i 'm still pro choice [ mostly because of this argument ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophical_aspects_of_the_abortion_debate#the_bodily_rights_argument ) but not unconditionally . 
  women should definitely be allowed to have abortions , but another part of me will always be sad about that .

  white , snowy , * beautiful * hell in switzerland . 
  good people are always the first to resign out of respect for their office ... to be replaced immediately with somebody who does n't give a shit, 
  nah , danish is trying to clear your throat whilst speaking with a potato in your mouth . 
  actually it is feasible in a pretty short time span of around 5 to 10 years if there is the political will for it . 
  i think you 're underestimating the huge degree of non fossil fuel energy sources available to us . 
  i mean there 's nuclear fission obviously , but also wind , solar , tidal , geothermal . 
  all of these technologies already exist and are in operation in many countries . 
  iirc half of germany 's energy comes from renewable sources . 
  this is n't a fantasy it 's real . 
  likewise , the energy savings initiatives are also already in practice and working effectively . 
  just google passivhaus and you 'll see how great that design is and how it 's already been rolled out across sections of germany and the uk . 
  and electrical cars are already here and they already work . 
  the only problem all of these things face is the powerful lobbying in many of our countries . 
  the oil lobby has made the uk government scrap the feed in tariffs which encourages home and business owners to adopt solar panels . 
  companies like tesla need financial investment to get their recharging grids spread out . 
  passivhaus needs governments to set it 's carbon neutral design as the standard building regulations . 
  non of this is crazy . 
  but all of it is necessary . 
  we can become oil independent if we follow through with this . 
  -- even so , you do n't need to cut off oil usage entirely . 
  just cut off most of it , and you can find the small remaining amount from elsewhere . 
  if we can just abolish most of our oil usage then that 's that , as far as saudi influence is concerned . 
  surely that 's possible ? 
  i do n't see any reason why it 's not, 
  or just reduce the amount of oil we use in the first place ... 
  there 's plenty of ways to do it . 
  we could create an eu wide subsidy for electric cars , increase national and eu wide building regulations to ensure best energy is not wasted ( especially passivhaus standards ) and invest in better public transport ( especially electric transport ) . 
  in one easy motion we 're free of saudi oil dependency and we 're half way to saving the planet from catastrophic climate change . 
  or we could just stop using oil . 
  you know , which we need to do anyway to avoid catastrophic climate change . 
  in one fell swoop swoop we 'd be halfway to saving our planet and be independent of saudi oil !, 
  it 's a no brainer . 
  that 's what makes this so serious !, 
  this is no joke . 
  a castle was blown up in belgium !, 
  did you not hear ? 
  i notice you 're also assimilating into british culture very nicely too . 
  just look at you , talking about * the weather * !,

  i hope the whole community can identify them and give them what they deserve ... 
  stop it . 
  stop - it . 
  this morning , i swear my bedroom was at c1 or bellow . 
  i just have to have the radiator on all the time now , because if you leave it the room becomes unbearable in a couple of hours . 
  i found the top post about the incredibles kind of funny , because it adds a really humourous slant on something i 'm already familiar with . 
  but i agree with you on the rest of it . 
  if i do n't already know original video that it 's referencing then it 's just `` something happens .
