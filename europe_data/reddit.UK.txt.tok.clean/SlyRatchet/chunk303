  it fucking snowed in sheffield . 
  ** snowed !, 
  laugh ? 
  what are you talking about !? 
  this is serious !, 
  just think of the children who were effected ... 
  they 'll probably remember it for literally weeks . 
  pestering their parents the whole time - they 're the real casualty of all this . 
  truly shocking . 
  my opinion of the whole situation has completely changed . 
  are n't pwc supposed to be * really * untrustworthy ? 
  it depends how much emphasis you put on social inclusion . 
  i mean , would you rather be $ 1,000 euros better off , or have a friend that you felt comfortable with and could see regularly ? 
  i could move to norway or sweden , get a job there , and be * materially * far better off than i am in [ south yorkshire ] ( https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/ad_1440375491.jpg ) , in the uk . 
  but i 'm not going to do that , because this is where all my friends and family are , who i can actually interact with . 
  being in relative poverty is essentially the same thing , only you do n't have to move . 
  it just happens to you . 
   taubira is seen as the devil by regular fn voters but i 'm not worrying about normal fn voters . 
  i 'm worried about her expanding support outwards to otherwise moderate voters . 
  all quite true , especially on hollande stealing her thunder . 
  but i still think you 're underestimating the role this gaff may play . 
  it 's true that all politicians have made gaffs like this at some point in their career . 
  but most have not made them at the height of their power , or right as they are in the perfect position to capitalise on a tragedy . 
  for instance , the then prime minister of the uk , gordon brown , was fighting an election campaign in 2010 , which he talked to a typical member of the public who happened to be very racist . 
  he smiled and did n't confront her , but then called her a [ `` bigoted woman '' as soon as he was out of sight , forgetting that he was still mic 'd up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctr8ivwbupe ) . 
  it 's not surprise that he lost that election . 
  it obviously was n't the only factor , but it did seriously damage him . 
  it made him look like a liar in front of the uk 's media just like this instance has made le pen look like a crank in front of france 's . 
  they can get away with making gaffs like this normally , ( like cameron 's [ `` calm down dear '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urwxkpdwg0g ) or [ `` i thought they only hated us . 
  who knew they hated each other even more ? 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxpou0w5oq0 ) ) but at a time when nation 's media is watching , it has damming consequences . 
  very true , but it 's worth noting that being significantly poorer than everyone else in your country is a really debilitating thing though , to the extent where it makes sense to call it a form of poverty . 
  i mean , in the uk basically all forms of socialising require money , like going out for meals , watching a movie , playing a video game . 
  basically everything . 
  what do you do if you 're so much poorer than everyone else that you ca n't participate in society ? 
  there 's nothing you can do . 
  that 's because you 're in relative poverty .

  and there goes most of the support she could have gotten in the way of the paris attacks . 
  if she had simply kept her mouth shut then loads of people would have naturally gravitated towards her in the hope of a simple solution to the problem of islamism . 
  now , she 's painted herself as a crazy far right candidate that ca n't be trusted . 
  france is certainly one of the largest cities i 've ever seen, 
  some other interesting videos from the economist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtwjledeume https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdreh4le7x0, 
  * remind me in 6 hours * * ask if there was beer, 
  thanks for the edit . 
  i was confused too, 
  ooooops sneaky edit, 
  eh , not really . 
  if you read the article you can see that basically nothing happened apart from a couple of parties gaining a point and she couple losing a point . 
  afd was already quite close to being third so it 's not a bit change . 
  -  according to a newspaper report the alternative for germany ( afd ) has reached the third place in the opinion polls for the first time , after the paris attacks . 
  according to `` bild '' newspaper ( german equivalent of the sun ) the right wing , populist party hit 15.5 % in the insa survey - that 's half a percentage point higher than in the previous week . 
  the cdu ( merkels party , epp in europarl ) stopped its recent fall in the polls and achieved 35 % of the vote . 
  that 's one point more than in the previous week . 
   the spd ( social democrats , s&d in europarl ) slipped half a percent to 23.5 % . 
  the left party ( gue in europarl ) lost a percentage point , leaving them with 10 % , like the greens ( european green party in europarl ) , for whom nothing has changed in comparison to the previous week . 
  the fdp ( fast drei prozent/free democratic party , alde in europarl ) lost one point and slipped to 5 % . 
  -- so that 's cdu/csu 35 % ( +1 ) spd 23.5 % ( -0.5 ) afd 10.5 % ( +0.5 ) die linke 10 % ( -1 ) gr\u00fcnen 10 % ( 0 ) fdp 5 % ( -1 ) not really a big shift . 
  the sort of thing you 'd see regularly from week to week anyway edit : sneak edit . 
  accidentally gave one party the wrong number, 
  / u/savannajeff, 
  if you just joined the eu there would n't be this problem !, 
   secular arab nationalism the specific word is probably [ ba'athism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ba%27athism ) . 
  please do n't use google translate, 
  indeed . 
  i was just using those four as examples !, 
  so far , it looks like most of the national subreddits of europe will be participating , 
  it looks like many of the other national subreddits ( / r/de , / r/austria , / r/unitedkingdom , / r/ireland , etc ) are going to be participating in the minute 's blackout too . 
  i think the number is actually still in flux . 
  last time i checked 120 or 128 was the number of confirmed dead , but there are about 80 in dangerous and unstable conditions who may yet die or survive . 
  so the number is still moving , from what i understand . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  you 're still far more likely to be in a plane or car accident than a terrorist incident ( i.e. 
  very very low risk ) . 
  this was a single ( and tragic ) incident , but there is no evidence that it is part of anything wider . 
  this was the apex , the climax . 
  and even then , europe 's a big place . 
  a disaster in paris does n't have much effect on the rest of the continent practically , although emotionally i think it is hard for a lot of us ... 
   i wonder what the consequences will be on intelligence sharing and police cooperation i think the only credible response is to significantly consolidate our domestic intelligence agencies and domestic security services . 
  it 's clear that , despite much being known about this terrorist cell , the authorities were unable to stop them . 
  one of the reasons for the twin towers disaster in the usa in 2001 was this exact same thing . 
  there were several domestic us intelligence services ( cia , fbi , likely the drug enforcement agency the national security agency agency were active and involved then too ) but due to a lack of coordination they were powerless to stop the attack . 
  this resulted in the creation of the department for homeland security , which has collects and oversees the running of all of the other agencies . 
  there needs to be a similar response in europe . 
  we have common borders , a common market and common interests . 
  the eu has most of the hallmarks of a traditional nation state , yet it does n't have that most essential of capabilities : the capability to defend itself . 
  for that , it relies on the member states . 
  what would fits better : 28 random different sets of agencies that do n't cooperate , and each set of agencies controls its own arbitrary patch of land , whilst the terrorists and criminals run between them , ** or ** one set of agencies ( intelligence , policing , border controls , etc ) that look out for the entire area ? 
  politico.eu has a pretty good break down of all the core facts [ here ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/paris-attacks-what-we-know-so-far-terrorism-isis/ ) . 
  core bits that you mentioned re : ** borders **  belgium put its police on high alert saturday , imposing stricter controls on its border with france and boosting police presence at key locations . 
  jan jambon , the interior minister , said authorities were investigating reports that some of the killers may have come from belgium , but that he `` had no confirmation at this point '' . 
  re : ** what 's the french government doing **  hollande has declared a nationwide state of emergency . 
  this gives authorities the right to restrict movement , cancel events , ban public gatherings and `` take all necessary measures '' to control the press . 
  this is unlikely to be the end point of their response , but actually the beginning . 
  hollande 's rhetoric is that of war , and will likely end up with an escalation of the war in syria .
