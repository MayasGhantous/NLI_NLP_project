  obama has already given an offer of unconditional support to the french , which could highly motivate an escalation of the war there . 
  but i stress that at this point in time they 're likely all plotting and formulating a response within the halls of power in france , and later with their international allies . 
  we are unlikely to hear anything until they have had some time to do this . 
  i actually just wrote a paper on the effects of the napoleonic wars on the development of germany !, 
  -  * `` solidarity of our hearts is your church , hate for the french is your religion , and freedom and fatherland are the holy , by which you worship '' * shitty translation , i know , but it shows you to what extent germans * defined themselves by hatred to the french * . 
  like he 's mentioning national unity and hatred for the french as essentially part of the same thing . 
  the purpose of germany practically being to hate french people . 
  how times have change , no ?

  thank you !, 
  i had no idea what any of this actually meant, 
  it 's also worth noting that the square that the brandenburg gate is in is actually called parizerplatz which means ` paris square ' and it was named that after the invasion of berlin by france under the command of napoleon . 
  it really adds perspective if you remember that just 200 years ago this invasion happened , followed obviously by the various others , including the second world war , but now the germans of berlin are happy to come out in solidarity to the french in a square that commemorates a horrific and bloody war between the two nations . 
  time really does heal all wounds . 
  i was talking my relative who lives in brussels a few weeks ago . 
  apparently belgium , and brussels specifically , has one of the largest illegal arms trades in europe . 
  terrorists will buy arms in belgium and then travel there to other major population centres that are less heavily guarded . 
  ( after the charlie hebdo incident , there have been members of the armed forces stationed outside all of the embassies , in addition to the usual police and security detail ) . 
  the train incident which involved three americans and one british man was done on a train from brussels to paris for precisely that reason . 
  we have no idea who they are . 
  the only information is that they 're associated with daesh ( aka isis ) . 
  that does n't tell us anything about the people who did it . 
  they could be migrants or refugees , or they could be french nationals . 
  heck , they could even be ethnic european converts to daesh . 
  the syrian passport is also pretty spurious at this point . 
  all we know is that there is a syrian passport as not who it belongs to , ( there 's even some scepticism about the existence of the passport ) . 
  before we know the actual identity of the attackers we ca n't determine whether this should effect our refugee policy . 
  it would make no sense to stop the flow of refugees , for instance , if all of these attackers are already french citizens . 
  to do what the new polish government is doing is just disgusting political opportunism . 
  let 's let the actually evidence determine our policies , rather than this baseless crap . 
  no idea who perpetrated these attacks yet ... but clearly , no matter what the facts actually are , this supports the line that the polish government was already advocating . 
  how interesting, 
  this was proven to be unrelated . 
  there have been several fires at the camp in recent times, 
  the way to determine whether something should get a tag or not , and if so , which tag , is like this : `` is this an image which would likely have * no * negative consequences if a boss or coworker or other peer ( family member , etc ) saw you viewing it ? 
  if yes , then add a nsfw tag . 
  then ask this `` is this image graphic enough that an individual * who is alone , with no chance of anybody else seeing what they 're looking at * may choose not to view it ? '', 
  if you can categorically say `` no '' then leave it with a nsfw but if the answer is yes then you have to add a nsfl . 
  you always err on the side of caution with these . 
  chocolate fountain anybody ? 
  i actually support doing that . 
  i 'm a big fan of cutting down our use of oil and gas overall , which will make us independent of saudi arabia and therefore capable of combatting its funding of wahhabism across the world . 
  i think that both of our experiences ( i , growing up in majority anglican uk , and you growing up in majority orthodox greece ) shows that christianity is certainly capable of being peaceful . 
  my point is that there are few fundamental differences between islam and christianity , and therefore islam has the possibility of being peaceful . 
  i do n't think that islam ( or even christianity , for that matter ) will ever be truly * liberal * in the sense that i am , but just because something does n't agree with me 100 % does n't mean it should be outlawed . 
  the only modes of thinking i do believe should be outlawed are those that specifically condone disorderly violence , which is only really the wahhabi school . 
  most schools of islam are certainly * regressive * insofar as they are against homosexuality , and believe that women should be subservient to men , but most of those are simply personal believes which they will not act upon personally . 
  so long as their is an assurance that they are will not act upon another human being , then i can not deny them their beliefs or their freedom . 
  and most muslims are certainly capable of that , and therefore deserve their freedom and their beliefs . 
  -- i 'd really like to cite some sources on this , but you 'll understand that it 's 4am and i 'm knackered ... nevermind the livethreads x_x, 
  goddamnit you guys are making me ** hungry **, 
  oh do n't worry . 
  i 've read such quotes . 
  you can find similar ones in christianity about stoning children to death . 
  anyway , the point is that in almost all religions they 've acknowledged somewhat that values change with time and thus look for metaphorical interpretations rather than literal ones , which is what most muslims do . 
  even sunni islam , which advocates a more literal understanding , has many ways of re-interpreting it , most notably through the great variety of arabic dialects which are more like their own languages . 
  that 's why you get such a variety of applications of islam , even within the sunni branch . 
  the words say things , but what they actually * mean * is a lot less clear and open to interpretation . 
   i stickied that name to your username oooo i have information stickied next to my name ? 
  i feel famous , popular even ^ _ ^ do n't worry about it !, 
  i 'm resigned to the fact that it 's out now and that people use it the place it actually came from was that i use my real name when organising amas , and i once made the mistake of dealing with an ama through our shared modmail , and then there was a leak to the rest of reddit ... fortunately i only used my first name . 
  god knows what would have happened had i included my first and last names ... 
  which it does n't , as i have discussed [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sqj61/paris_attacks_discussion_thread/cwzl227 ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sqj61/paris_attacks_discussion_thread/cwzli1k ) . 
  for that small , violent wahhabi branch of islam , i would say that they a ) should not be allowed in our countries and b ) that their influence should be curtailed world wide where possible . 
  i 'm a bit old fashioned in that i do actually believe in universal global values . 
  so i fear that we probably actually agree with each other . 
  my main quibble is just with exactly * who * should be included in this . 
  i think that most of islam is no less archaic than many of our other believes , even some of our secular beliefs and that it would only be a net harm to society to punish these individuals and exclude them from our societies when they would do us no harm . 
   logan it 's never gon na stop being weird when people use my irl name on the internet , is it ? 
  and we should target the few , who 've chosen this path . 
  not the many who have n't . 
  we should n't . 
  if something advocates mass killing , and other evil acts , whether it is an individual or an ideology ( whether that ideology is secularly or religiously motivated ) it should not be allowed to spread . 
  it 's the people who do the acts , but it 's the ideas that drive them . 
  you 've still got it wrong . 
  81 % are always against . 
  8 % say sometimes it 's okay . 
  there 's also a third category of undecided/abstentions who are n't mentioned . 
  so only 8 % of muslims will actually say that sometimes , violence in defence of justified . 
  just 8 percent . 
  not 29 % . 
  not 19 % . 
  not any other number you want to pull out of thin air . 
  it 's eight . 
  we could always just stop using fossil fuels , which we really need to do anyway in order to stop climate change . 
  there 's plenty of parties in european countries you can vote for who have these policies . 
  not really , actually . 
  some of the most ardent islamic terrorists ( never mind non-islamic terrorists like anders breivik ) are white european converts . 
  there 's a few high profile examples , but this was the first one that came up through googling : [ ginger terrorists plots to kill prince charles ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11883225/family-of-ginger-terrorist-who-plotted-to-put-prince-harry-on-throne-praised-for-alerting-police.html ), 
  what about secular ideologies ? 
  yeah , i agree that saudi arabia is a huge problem to moderate islam . 
  it 's actually shocking as well , because a majority of the saudi arabian population are n't even wahhabi - it 's just the royal family that is !, 
  ( and also saudi arabian wahhabis hate daesh too ... ) . 
  i do believe that saudi arabia is actually a bigger threat to international peace than daesh is .
