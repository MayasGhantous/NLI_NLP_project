    81 % say such acts are never justified  is it not bad enough that the other 29 % finds it to be justifiable ? 
  if you 'd have bothered to read the entire quote ( let alone the actual article that you linked me , which i have read ) then you would see that i said this  while fewer than one-in-ten say violence against civilians either is often justified ( 1 % ) or is sometimes justified ( 7 % ) to defend islam so 8 % believe that violence is sometimes justified to defend islam . 
  not 29 % . 
  just 8 . 
  yeah , there are literally millions of them . 
  and islam is a religion of 1.5 billion afaik . 
  so that 's at least 1,000,000 ( or 1x10 ^ 5 ) within 1,000,000,000,000 or ( 1x10 ^ 8 ) . 
  so it 's a drop in the ocean relative to the whole thing . 
  additionally , the thing you 've got to keep in mind about qatar and the united arab emerates , is that they both have tiny populations . 
  they 're almost as small as luxembourg !, 
  i looked at the executive summary of that report . 
  the full thing can be found [ here ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf ) . 
  here 's some things i find interesting . 
  seeing as we 're talking about a terrorist attack  few u.s. muslims voice support for ** suicide bombing ** or other forms of violence against civilians in the name of islam ; ** 81 % say such acts are never justified ** , while fewer than one-in-ten say violence against civilians either is often justified ( 1 % ) or is sometimes justified ( 7 % ) to defend islam . 
  around the world , most muslims also reject suicide bombing and other attacks against civilians . 
  however , substantial minorities in several countries say such acts of violence are at least sometimes justified , including 26 % of muslims in bangladesh , 29 % in egypt , 39 % in afghanistan and 40 % in the palestinian territories . 
  on the issue of integration in a multicultural , western society  overall , the survey finds that ** most muslims see no inherent tension between being religiously devout and living in a modern society ** . 
  nor do they see any conflict between religion and science . 
  many favor democracy over authoritarian rule , believe that humans and other living things have evolved over time and say they ** personally enjoy western movies , music and television ** -- even though most think western popular culture undermines public morality . 
  on extremism within islam  at least ** half of muslims ** in most countries surveyed say they ** are concerned about religious extremist groups ** in their country , including two-thirds or more of muslims in egypt ( 67 % ) , tunisia ( 67 % ) , iraq ( 68 % ) , guinea bissau ( 72 % ) and indonesia ( 78 % ) . 
  on balance , more are worried about islamic extremists than about christian extremists . 
  also , this is from page 22 ( which is the section most of that charts data came from . 
   when muslims around the world say they want sharia to be the law of the land , what role do they envision for religious law in their country ? 
  first , many , but by no means all , supporters of sharia believe ** the law of islam should apply only to muslims ** . 
  there 's a difference between mass immigration and multi-culturalism . 
  immigration is a movement of people from one place to another . 
  multiculturalism is a ( potentially static ) society with multiple different view points and ways of live within it , living in harmony , which exists all throughout europe . 
  i think you 're underestimating the huge diversity of islam . 
  this is what i wrote in a different comment  the ideology is [ wahhabism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabism ) ( also known as salafism ) , which is a sub sect of the [ sunni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sunni_islam ) branch of islam . 
  so it 's subsection of a subsection of a religion . 
   it 's this particular creed which preaches violent jihad ( as opposed to all other forms of jihad , which is about an inner spiritual struggle , rather than an external struggle , let alone a violent external struggle ) . 
  this is based off of a * literal * and * personal * reading of the sacred texts . 
  this focus on literal understandings of the texts is also found in a lot of sects of christianity , too . 
  however , it 's also a tiny school of thought which is also very internally divided . 
  al qaeda and daesh ( also known as isis ) are both followers of wahhabism , they were even originally the same organisation ( daesh was originally simply the iraqi branch of al qaeda ) , yet they hate each other today and have fought against each other . 
  so the creed of wahhabism ( which i agree is incompatible ) is only a tiny , tiny section . 
  there 's whole branches of islam which almost have more in common with entire other religions or even political ideologies than with wahhabism . 
  for instance , there 's the branch of [ shia islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shia_islam ) , which about half of the islamic world subscribes to ( it 's the opposite of sunni islam , which i mentioned earlier ) , and is incredibly moderate and highly compatible with western society edit : thought i 'd mention a book i read a couple of years ago which was helpful in understanding this : [ * what 's left ?

  i would n't call it a culture . 
  it 's more of an ideology , and even then ... 
  the ideology is [ wahhabism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabism ) ( also known as salafism ) , which is a sub sect of the [ sunni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sunni_islam ) branch of islam . 
  so it 's subsection of a subsection of a religion . 
  it 's this particular creed which preaches violent jihad ( as opposed to all other forms of jihad , which is about an inner spiritual struggle , rather than an external struggle , let alone a violent external struggle ) .

  al qaeda and daesh ( also known as isis ) are both followers of wahhabism , they were even originally the same organisation ( daesh was originally simply the iraqi branch of al qaeda ) , yet they hate each other today and have fought against each other . 
  but then you found out much more interesting things , such as that most daesh fighters have not actually read the q'oran , and are instead being preached to . 
  likewise , the 9/11 bombers hardly even mentioned religion when they undertook their actions . 
  it was only afterwards that osama bin laden claimed religious inspiration . 
  so the actual driving force behind this is the political ambitions of the movement 's leaders , not religion . 
  the religion is just a cloak to cover it in . 
  it 's like how the prime minister says allegiance to the queen , even though the pm is the one with all the pm . 
  the queen is religion and the pm is politics . 
  edit : thought i 'd mention a book i read a couple of years ago which was helpful in understanding this : [ * what 's left ?

  people do bad things , religions do n't . 
  the horrors of secular fascism in germany and italy , as with the communist inspired authoritarianism in soviet russia and china are all more damning than the work of any individual sect of a religion . 
  extremism which aims to kill people for such arbitrary reasons is bad , whether it 's religious or secular . 
  there 's no evidence yet as to whether they were simply visitors , immigrants or even french nationals . 
  so at this point it 's impossible to say . 
  wait until tomorrow when we will know more .

  yes . 
  we have implemented a moratorium on the movements of police and other such forces . 
  good idea , yes . 
  we 've sending out warnings to other people and users to remove any mention of police movements whatsoever . 
  i 'm uncertain at what rate they 're being killed . 
  it must be going on fairly slowly because they 're still in there and it 's been over an hour . 
  it 's not certain at this point if any will make it out alive . 
  okay, 
  do you have a report for the masks ?

  disregard comment : misread the comment i replied to . 
  -- fortunately , even if they do have a sniper rifle it probably wo n't do them much good . 
  most terrorists are relatively unskilled at what they do , and a sniper rifle is perhaps the most difficult weapon to use effectively . 
  other terrorists , such as [ the beltway sniper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_allen_muhammad#military_service ) in the usa had experience in the armed forces . 
  most terrorists do not have access to such expertise . 
  even daesh ( aka isis ) has hardly any capabilities with sniper rifles , so even if this person has served with daesh already ( which is completely ** un ** certain at this point ) they 're unlikely to have any experience with sniper rifles . 
  that 's why terrorists like bombs so much . 
  they take almost no expertise and can be deployed widely , cheaply . 
  -- of course it goes without saying that i 'm sorry for the victims , their loved ones and the people of paris . 
  we know next to nothing at this point .
