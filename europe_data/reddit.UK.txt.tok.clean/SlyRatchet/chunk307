  the german education system is far from perfect , but the atmosphere 's `` one side fits all '' style of education is worse in my opinion . 
  everyone should have an equal opportunity and an equal quality of education , but that does not mean that you should give them all * the same education * . 
  it just means that a lot of people are forced to do things they hate and are n't good at and are doomed to fail and feel bad about it . 
  it also completely fails to adequately create a labour force ready for the next generation because everyone is pushed towards academic skills , meanwhile there 's nobody to do the essential jobs like plumming . 
  the german system may not be perfect , but it solves all the problems of english education , and then some, 
  i 'm not saying whether i have a penis or not , but i think the point of the blanket is n't for privacy . 
  people can see what you 're doing even with a blanket . 
  the point is that it 's relaxing and comfy in bed . 
  i mean , that 's why people usually have sex in beds as opposed to desk chairs . 
  i actually really like twitter . 
  whenever a big story comes up i can have all of the various perspectives on the issue * straight from the horses mouth * in * their own words * . 
  i like to use it when i get up in the morning , along with a quick read of the bbc . 
  all the top tweets from the people i follow are near the top . 
  it 's just great to get a concise daily dosage . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  i think that 's also true for most of europe though . 
  i 've been to germany and belgium and sweden and every time it feels like i never left the uk . 
  if it were n't for the different languages i probably would n't be able to tell the difference , and even then the language barrier is small because every one speaks english and all of the languages are so similar anyway . 
  to be fair , whether it was a referendum or not , the independentists still won , because they gained a larger share of the vote than the anti-independentists . 
  the remainder were not fussed one way or the other . 
  if you discount the people who are split , then the independentists simply won . 
   nd eu policies ? 
  out the window . 
  free movement ? 
  out the window !, 
  to be fair , it 's actually completely ambiguous what status a new state which splits off from an eu member would have within the eu . 
  it 's uncertain . 
  however , the only people who can make it known are the current heads of government of the various eu states ( people like david cameron and mario rajoy ) . 
  the heads of government can ask the eu to make a declaration of what it would do in this instance . 
  however , no head of government has done this . 
  this leads me to highly suspect that if they were to ask the eu for a declaration , then the answer would not be in their favour . 
  the truth is more harmful to cameron and rajoy 's desire to keep their countries in tact , than the ambiguity is . 
  the only reason they have for not asking is if they believe that the eu will say that secessionist states do have the right to join the eu . 
  additionally , ex commission president borosso has stated already that if a state does secede from an eu member state , then that state would likely be able to join the eu automatically . 
  so , it is ambiguous , but all the information that we do have available suggests that secessionist states would be allowed to join the eu upon independence automatically . 
  definitely agree . 
  one of our longterm goals is nigel farage and geert wilders , or at least another high ranking ukip member like [ douglas carswell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/douglas_carswell ) ( only ukip member of parliament ) or [ suzanne evans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suzanne_evans ) ( deputy chairperson ) . 
  that said , they seem to be a bit harder to contact than a lot of the other people we 've done so far , so if any body has any contacts they would like to share ( in complete confidence , of course ) then we 'd greatly appreciate . 
  we 're also working on getting a few non-uk politicians , especially from germany ( we happen to have acquired a lot of leads for that country ) but obviously the language barrier makes things harder . 
  -- also a psw : the more polite all of our users are in these amas , the higher the chances are that we 'll be able to get more and better amas in the future . 
  notably notable is it that she 's the uk 's only lib dem/alde mep in the uk , which is by far the most pro-eu party in the uk , but she also shares her constituency with nigel farage himself and three other ukip meps . 
  really strange mix !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_east_england_ ( european_parliament_constituency ), 
  thanks !, 
  i feel as though i 've managed to shorten down my comments so much since i got here !, 
  yes and no . 
  the various member states of the european union are actually a lot more integrated than some other places that we typically consider as countries themselves . 
  -- i 'm gon na use the bench mark of the usa . 
  so the usa as we know it was created in 1789 . 
  for the first several years of its existence it only had 3 federal departments ^ [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_federal_executive_departments ) and it was not until after 50 years of the usa 's existence ( the eu is only about 60 years old ) that it got a fourth department ( the department of the interior ) . 
  so for this whole period there was absolutely no oversight of the various police forces at the nation state level . 
  there was no oversight of economic policy at the nation state level until after the usa had existed for over 100 years . 
  and furthermore there was no oversight of education , environmental nor transport until much later either . 
  now let 's compare this with the european union of today . 
  you can see a list of the various policy areas in which the eu executive has some power ^ [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_pillars_of_the_european_union ) . 
  as you can see it includes things as wide ranging as ** citizenship , education , transport , immigration , healthcare , culture , foreign policy ** . 
  the member states of the european union are extremely well integrated to the point where we are more integrated than the states of the usa were for much of their first decades . 
  -- i am giving you a somewhat simplistic answer here . 
  i 'm simply pointing out a ) that a state is a set of fairly closely integrated government institutions and b ) that we agree the usa is just such a state . 
  therefore if the eu is more closely integrated than the usa was for most of its history , then it follows that the eu is , at least to a significant degree , a state . 
  however , there are also much broader issues coming up . 
  the effects of globalisation are fundamentally changing what it means to be a state . 
  the presence of organisations like nato , and the un , never mind the eu and the european court of human rights , and the increasing economic interdependence mean that states no longer have the ability to act independently like they used to from around 1700 till 1945 . 
  so , we if we really want to answer the question conclusively , we need to ask things like `` what really * is * a state in the 21st century ? '', 
  which is a question deserving of its own thesis , rather than my simple comparison between the eu and other things which we agree are states . 
  still , i think the fact that the eu has reached such a level of integration and ability to act , despite most other states becoming less able to act is somewhat of a testament to the state-like nature of the eu , and a testament to the fact that it is definitely comparable to other nation states of the world today . 
  -- ** tl ; dr : ** the eu is far more integrated today than the usa was for most of its existence , especially in areas of justice , policing , education and healthcare . 
  however , the nature of states in the 21st century has changed significantly due to the effects of globalisations , making direct comparisons difficult . 
  the nature of what a state is is ambiguous . 
  that said , the eu has achieved a significant level of integration to the point where it functions similarly to many other sets of institutions which we agree are states . 
  therefore , it is useful to assume that the eu is a state . 
  i think it 's fair to say though that the city of london did n't grow as much as it would have done , had we been in the eurozone . 
  i mean , british pound sterling is used considerably less in an international context than the euro is . 
  the euro is the world 's second or third reserve currency , even during the hight of the financial crisis , where as the pound falls much further down that list . 
  to be fair , if you look at the world gdp rankings , then he 's kind of right , insofar as there are three main groups . 
  * ** there 's the ( super ) large group of economies with a value of over ten trillion us dollars ** , of which there are only three members : the european union ( 1st , with 18.5 trillion us$ ) , the usa ( 2nd , 17.4 trillion ) and china ( 3rd , with 10.4 trillion ) . 
  this is the group of economies which could arguably be called [ super powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superpower ) in terms of the economic aspect of international relations . 
  * then there 's the middle sized economies of ** between 1 and five trillion us$ ** . 
  can we just take a moment to appreciate that there is no economy in the world with more than five trillion us$ but less then 10 trillion ? 
  that 's actually really significant that there 's a huge gap . 
  there 's a very easily identifiable border between the three large economies and the middle sized economies . 
  there 's only ** 13 middle sized economies ** with japan at the top with 4.8 trillion in value and mexico at the bottom of the list with 1.3 trillion . 
  the uk very snugly fits into this group with its value of 3 trillion . 
  in terms of the uk 's economic size , it belongs definitely within this group , which you could accurately call middle sized . 
  this is the group which could effectively be described as being [ great powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_power ) * then there 's the ** small group ** also known as the ** `` and then everybody else '' ** group . 
  there 's a very quick dive from mexico 's 1.3 trillion us$ into indonesia 's 800 billion . 
  this is the group of nations which could be called [ regional powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regional_power ) in the economic aspect of international relations theory . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** basically , the uk is not a ` mid sized ' economy in the sense that is is in the middle position . 
  it is a middle sized economy in the sense that there are three identifiable groups of economies as being large , world powers , middling powers with some global influence , but not too much , and small powers who have relatively small influence even at a regional level . 
  well , everyone is in it for themselves . 
  it 's just that we 're all better off individually if we all work together towards common goals . 
  we must all stick together otherwise we will all hang separately . 
  that 's somewhat been the intention since the start . 
  the european coal and steel community ( precursor to the modern eu ) was founded in the aftermath of wwii because non of the six founding members ( france , germany , italy , belgium , netherlands and luxembourg ) wanted to experience the devastation of war ever again . 
  ( well , there were also other reasons too - like the holocaust being pretty bad - but these were secondary ) . 
  it was in all the original six 's interests to avoid another war . 
  so they fused their coal and steel industries together to make war not only unthinkable but militarily impossible . 
  not because it was good , but because it was better for everyone that way . 
  the modern eu is just an extension of that . 
  why should we have a common market ?
