  yeah this is somewhat where i fall on the issue . 
  renewables exist today and we are gon na `` lock in '' catastrophic levels of climate change in 2017 if we do n't take drastic action * today * . 
  everything after 2017 is basically `` we fucked up . 
  the house is on fire . 
  we need to stop pouring oil on it ! '', 
  fusion is great , but we need it today , not in 2027 . 
  at all the previous climate summits like kyoto and so on the end date for when we need to stop using coal , oil and other fossil fuels was 2050 ~ ish . 
  that made sense back when those treaties were made in the 90s , but our economies and our consumption as just expanded ridiculously since then . 
  the 2050 deadline is no longer available . 
  at this rate , by 2050 we 'll be flooded by millions of climate refugees who will make this crisis look like a trickle . 
  if it was 1937 and you knew that worls war two would happen within two years , you would n't invest in a spit fighter that would be ready in a decade or two . 
  you 'd want technologies that were ready already . 
  that 's what renewables are . 
  we already have solar power , tidal , geothermal , wind and even bio products . 
  we need to invest whole sale into those on the scale we mobilised to fight the second world war . 
  that 's the crisis we 're in . 
  great to hear !, 
  following in the traditions of portugal . 
  hopefully , more countries will catch on quickly and we can start treating drug addicts like the victims that they are , rather than punishing them for their circumstances . 
  drugs are a health issue , not a crime issue . 
  oh that 's interest . 
  in what other ways would it supposedly help ? 
  not andrew cooper , but here 's some information for those who 're confused ( i know / u/savannajeff is n't and they know their shit ) . 
  ** [ iter : international thermonuclear experimental reactor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iter ) . 
  ** this is a an experimental fusion reactor project which is 45 % funded by the eu and all the experiments are conducted within eu borders . 
  ** what is a fusion reactor ? 
  ** well first you 've got ta know a bit about ** fission ** . 
  currently , all nuclear power plants run on the system of nuclear fission , that is , they * split * atoms and bounce them off each other to create a cascade effect , where each splitting of the atom creates energy . 
  it 's also considered very dangerous , and has led to accidents such as chernobyl , fukushima and three mile island . 
  it is considered dangerous because it is radioactive and unstable . 
  there are also difficulties with dealing with nuclear waste , as the wasted nuclear material remains highly radioactive for a long time . 
  it 's also extremely expensive to build fission reactors for the production of domestic energy , which is why there 's no commercial fission reactor anywhere in the world which has been built using entirely private funds . 
  to the best of my knowledge every nuclear power plant so far has had , at the very least , a large publicly ( i.e. 
  state ) funded subsidy . 
  ** fusion ** is the forcing together of atoms , instead of splitting them . 
  the theory goes that a fusion reactor would only produce water as a waste material , which is non-radioactive , eliminating the need for storage of spent plutonium . 
  the reactors are also non-dangerous and do not have the potential to leak nuclear material into the atmosphere if they break , unlike fission reactors . 
  the downside , is that fusion reactors have been in the research phase for decades and are likely to remain in the research phase for years or decades longer . 
  -- slight bit of analysis here : i think that the real crux as to whether nuclear fusion should be supported is based on the likelihood of getting anything useful out of it in comparison to research in other areas . 
  to what extent could the money invested in renewable energy * manufacture * as well as renewable energy research yield results in comparison to a hypothetical fusion reactor . 
  so , it becomes a question between investing in something which is reasonably certain ( renewables ) and something which is reasonably uncertain ( fusion ) . 
  that 's not to say we should n't invest in research . 
  it is pretty clear at this point in human history that more research and more knowledge is just a good think . 
  however , you have to keep in mind that we only have so many resources to spend on research so it is a question of spending them where the best rewards are ( in terms of the environment ) . 
  i do n't know enough to really adequately make that judgement , though . 
  yes because a ) it 's difficult for them to leave the country for any reason b ) it 's harder for them to buy foreign products c ) the state of the economy as a whole long term is worse because foreign companies are finding it harder to sell abroad . 
  yeah , in the short time the state of the icelandic economy is probably better off for having tighter monetary control , but that 's to some extent at the expense of icelanders ' freedom to travel abroad and participate with the world outside iceland , and in the long term it 'll also probably be bad for the icelandic economy as they remain closed off and isolated economically . 
  i 'm not saying joining the eu would have been a magic bullet . 
  at the time it was basically just two different difficult choices , but i think in the long term the eu route would have been better , especially if they had taken on a reforming role once inside . 
  why are the cop21 talks important ? 
  what are you expecting to happen there ? 
  because they joined in on the syrian civil war almost exclusively to bomb syrian kurdistan , rather than daesh ( isis ) , despite daesh being far more dangerous . 
  ( kurdistan separatists only did a few car bombs , where as daesh is responsible for the worst terrorist attack in turkish history ) . 
  also because , last time i checked , akp does n't support any decentralisation of power , which is basically a `` kurdistan will have no autonomy within turkey whatsoever '' . 
  maybe anti-kurd is a bit strong , but they 're definitely not pro-kurd . 
  interesting , i 've not seen it mentioned much that in the kurdistan region , akp is the second largest party by a significant margin , which is interesting given that they seem to be so anti-kurd . 
  are these votes coming from turks living in turkish-kurdistan or from kurds themselves ? 
   finally : i am much more interested in the political future of the eu . 
  the german people traditionally insisted on our politicans stayingg away from international affairs or a leading role in international politics . 
  after the ( in german eyes ) spectacular failure of the other eu states to step up to the plate when it comes to refugees , i could see that opinion tilting nationally in favour of a german lead role in the eu . 
  me too . 
  i feel as though this was the one aspect of the german national identity that the article did n't pick up on : it 's europeanism . 
  i mean , part of germany 's idea of itself as a post-national nation has been that it completely submerged itself and integrated itself into the european union and whole-heartedly supports it in a way that hardly any other eu state does . 
  this [ documentary by uk journalist/commentator andrew marr about angela merkel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0n9_v7wluw ) is very insightful of her particular views on europe , which i think are somewhat representative of germany more widely : that is , that there is no germany without europe . 
  ( which is funny , because at this stage there is no europe without germany either ) . 
  so it raises questions about what germany will do as the eu is steered through these times of crises , what will germany do to ensure its survival ? 
  where will the eu be taken ? 
  tl ; dr the author seems a little split on exactly what form german nationalism takes , but broadly speaking he claims that there 's two . 
  one is the ` post-national ' or multi-cultural form which they adopted immediately after the holocaust ( or , in the 1960s at least ) . 
  it 's all built in with their complete rejection of the nazi past . 
  however , kundnani ( the author ) basically says that this is more how germans like to think of themselves , rather than what they actually are . 
  in reality , they 've continued to disallow second and even third generation turkish immigrants ( descendants of the gastarbeiter ) from ever obtaining citizenship . 
  and the rise of radical right wing groups like pegida and the almost daily occurrences of arson attacks on asylum centres has somewhat shattered that self perception . 
  the second self-perception the germans have , which kundnani seems to give the impression that the germans are less aware of , is that their nationalism is tied to their economy and their currency . 
  during the reconstruction process after the second world war there was what 's called the economic miracle ( along with germany winning the world cup ) where west germany began to outpace the rest of western europe . 
  the mercedes symbol has become an image more worthy of pride than the german flag itself . 
  but this self perception that germans did n't even realise they had has also been shattered due to the wv scandal on the emissions test . 
  i mean , i was reading a lot of german media when this came out and i just did n't understand the uproar and shock . 
  one of germany 's leading magazines came out with [ this front cover ] ( http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-901471-thumbflex-hogk.jpg ) which as the title `` the suicide '' . 
  it 's only with this context of german economic nationalism that it begins to make sense . 
  so the question in the title ( ` will the soul of post war germany survive ? ' ), 
  is a pretty good question to ask . 
  how are germans going to see themselves in several years time , as a nation ? 
  their post-national/post-racial identity and their identity as a supplier of quality brands have both taken great , big hits at the same time . 
  there 's little to fall back on in terms of national identity . 
  yeah , i was arguing in another thread earlier today that we need to radically increase the resources and jurisdictional powers of the eu 's frontex border agency . 
  i 'm not really a fan of doing it `` like hungary did '' ( in that they closed down their internal borders with other eu/schengen countries ) , but we need a proper borders agency . 
  currently , if someone lodges an asylum bid and fails ( point one ) then the do n't get granted asylum , but they do n't normally get deported either . 
  we need to ensure deportations actually happen for asylum seekers who are ineligible . 
  smuggling networks are not being targeted because that would require delving into libya , and possibly violating their territorial integrity . 
  also , most european countries are not taking refugees direct from the camps around syria , but focusing on those which turn up on their doorstep , which incentivises risky travel across the med . 
  the uk is the only country i know of which takes refugees directly from those camps , and the uk is accepting a pitifully low number of 20,000 over five years . 
  also , the logistical aid we are providing currently is insubstantial . 
  -- we 're sort of halfway to doing a lot of these things , but we 're very limp risted and have n't applied them properly . 
  we need to work together as a european union and implement a continent wide response , rather than 28 different national responses . 
  second comment , because , different topic all together : i would n't call this a * major * victory , not by any stretch . 
  in the [ last election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_general_election,_june_2015 ) several months ago akp got just over 40 % of the vote . 
  and this time again they have got 50 % of the vote . 
  so we 're in the same situation , probably . 
  this situation is n't really good for akp because they 're not going to be able to achieve their main goals , which is changing the constitution with a super-majority to make president erdogan an ` executive president ' ( as opposed to a ceremonial president ) .
