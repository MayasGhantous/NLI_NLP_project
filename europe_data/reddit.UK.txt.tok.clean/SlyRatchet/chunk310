   well this thread is idle . 
  it was literally posted four minutes ago , 
  yes , of course . 
  you think europe will turn into hell on earth because we let shelter some refugees ? 
  to be fair , sweden and denmark do n't have any real oil reserves to speak of , yet they 're actually outpacing norway in terms of zero-carbon energy . 
  so having a big wealth of natural resources is n't essential to following the scandinavian model on fossil fuels . 
   i wonder how many people get killed every year because they get hit by drunk drivers . 
  [ there 's about 30 thousand road deaths per year in the european union ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/statistics/index_en.htm ) according to eurostat . 
  on the other hand [ amnesty international ] ( https://www.amnesty.org.uk/actions/syria-crisis-turn-lights-back-four-years-aleppo?gclid=cmv8uc7t78gcfrctgwodnykk5w ) claims that 200,000 syrians have been killed in the past four years ( so , an average of 50,000 per year ) and * 11 million * ( that 's 11,000,000 ) have been displaced ( that is , they 've become refugees ) . 
  so , i 'd say the situation in syria is just a little bit worse than the situation of road traffic accidents in europe . 
   is there a major movement caring about those people ? 
  yup , actually . 
  [ this ] ( http://think.direct.gov.uk/ ) is the uk 's main agency for increasing road safety . 
  that 's a false dichotomy . 
  you 're making it seem like there 's only two options . 
  that 's not true . 
  there 's many . 
  here 's what i would do : * firstly : send away all migrants who do not have a legitimate reason to flee their country of origin . 
  in practice , this means that we would only accept people from syria , and a few other special individuals who have particular reason to flee . 
  this deals with the economic migrants . 
  * secondly : target all smuggling networks . 
  this means working with the relevant authorities in tunisia , egypt , algeria and turkey . 
  for libya there is no functioning government , so we would have to send in troops ourselves to destroy the smuggling networks . 
  this means arresting individuals and destroying their assets . 
  * third : refugee processing centres in the regions surrounding syria . 
  allow them to apply for asylum to europe from there . 
  we will accept some refugees , but only legitimate cases . 
  however , most refugees will remain in the countries directly bordering syria because * fourth we will increase our financial and logistical aid to the countries bordering syria in the understanding that they will continue to protect and care for the several million refugees who are already there , and a significant portion of any more of the 6 million refugees currently within syria . 
  so there you go . 
  a measured and balanced solution which is very much between both of the extremes you outlined . 
  so , the world is already bad , therefore we should do nothing ? 
  * that 's * ` stupid , blind , self-indulgent ' . 
  just because you did n't do something in the past does n't make it okay to do nothing . 
  it 's bad that people do nothing about the horrific situations they know nothing about , but that 's just ignorance . 
  it 's a whole ` nother level to know something 's bad and be okay with it . 
  and yeah , i 'm all for rational , clear thought . 
  i 'd love some more of that . 
  and rational clear thought is saying that yes , there are a lot of economic migrants . 
  those economic migrants should be turned back . 
  but those refugees who are actually , legitimately fleeing war and persecution should be helped . 
  that is rational thought : being able to treat economic migrants and refugees as two separate groups , without lumping them into this big , ambiguous basket of ` migrants ' . 
   as a result of their poor decisions . 
  you 're okay doing nothing whilst children who had no choice in the matter drown because if circumstances outside of their control ? 
  and you 're okay with legitimate refugees who are fleeing war drowning in the middle of the sea amongst strangers ? 
  you feel no sympathy whatsoever for these human beings ? 
  you think we should do nothing to help them ? 
  because you use your own currency which is backed up by oil and high living standards . 
  if you joined the eurozone , everything would be cheaper , 
  interesting , that would put it equal to or bellow spain , germany , czech republic and norway 's highest points . 
  however , the data in your chart is from late 2014 , where as the data in the image above is from 2012 . 
  which is interesting , which is very strange , because this difference in the data should make london look even more expensive than it really is ( the gb # has rocketed in value against the euro over this period , and house prices in london are also rising hugely year on year ) yet according to all this , london is still a lot cheaper than i would have expected . 
  a lot of the [ protests which preceded the fall of the wall ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wende_und_friedliche_revolution_in_der_ddr#triumph_der_friedlichen_demonstranten ) and the unification of germany were also very peaceful , and make me believe a lot more in humanity . 
  it really marks a change in the times that protests which would have been met with violence decades previously were allowed to continue unabated and succeed in their aims in the late 1980s and 1890s . 
  such an interesting history .

  yeah , i 've always thought that it was a completely logical conclusion that if you 've got a common internal travel area , with a common visa policy then you * need * a common external border . 
  i mean , a border is only as strong as the weakest point in that border . 
  if there 's 28 different national borders agencies , then there 's a lot of different opportunities for those borders to be weak , and you need a common agency shared by all the member states to petrol it and apply uniform standards . 
  this is a pan european problem and requires a pan-european solution . 
  -- i do n't even know why greece would reject this proposal ... 
  it 'd basically be a form of financial assistance to them , as they would no longer need to spend quite as much money border security , which is money they could spend on other things . 
  edit : just did some digging , actually . 
  [ germany already offered greece ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/16/germany-greece-financial-aid-refugee-crisis ) some form of financial assistance to deal with the refugee crisis ( according to merkel 's press secretary ) . 
  i do n't know whether the deal was accepted or not, 
  do you have any source for that ? 
  i 'd to know more, 
  how can they guard the eu 's borders when they have no money ? 
  this is why we need a stronger eu border protection service . 
  the eu has a common travel area inside with no borders , which means it needs a common external border with real muscle . 
  it already exists in the form of the frontex agency but it is radically underfunded and relies heavily on all the national borders agencies . 
  you know that introducing data and introducing opinion are n't mutually exclusive ? 
  you can do both at the same time . 
  yeah , i 'm very open about there being no data for the time immediately before and after merkel 's announcement . 
  that 's actually my main criticism of the comment i replied to , that there is no data to back up his claim . 
  normally i just ask for people to back up their spurious claims , because the onus is on the person making the claim to prove that it 's true , not random observers to prove that it 's false . 
  however in reddit that only leads to downvotes because the burden of proof seems to have been reversed . 
  so i felt obligated to provide some inform to show just how ridiculous that claim was . 
  that the claim ridiculous firstly because there is no data and secondly because a tenfold increase would be several times larger than the bigger than any increase over any period of time within the last ten years . 
  also , this comment was just an excellent opportunity to introduce hard data into the mix . 
  there is a near endless amount of ignorance and misinformation on this topic from all factions that i relish any opportunity to supply statistics , especially when we have an organisation ( eurostat ) which is so good at providing relevant data so , hopefully i 've not lost any respect with you :3 i know i took up the burden of proof when it was n't my position , but i had two very good reasons to do so !, 
  you 've said that you ca n't believe this is getting upvoted . 
  i 'd appreciate knowing what you specifically think is bad about it . 
   now it has been multiplied tenfold . 
  that 's just hyperbolic bs . 
  look , [ here is a graph of asylum applications in the eu from 2004 till 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/0/01/asylum_applications_%28non-eu%29_in_the_eu-28_member_states%2c_2004%e2%80%9314_%28%c2%b9%29_%28thousands%29_yb15_iii.png ) ( the numbers on the side are asylum applications , listed in thousands ) . 
  merkel made her announcement in august 2015 , which was so recent that there is no data for it . 
  however , there is [ this graph ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a1/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_eu-28%2c_january_2014_%e2%80%93_june_2015.png ) also from eurostat , which shows the break down by month ( again , the date after merkel 's announcement is not included , because it is so recent that there is no data ) . 
  i would like to point out that ** nowhere in the past decade has there been a ten fold increase ** . 
  let me repeat that : ** there is no tenfold increase ** .
