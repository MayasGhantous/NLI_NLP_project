  the labour conference was a bit later . 
  this one had a huge amount going on in it . 
  it was the first labour conference with its new leader jeremy corbyn who can be described as a socialist by most definitions of the word . 
  it led to a huge gaff where corbyn and his team attempted to introduce a debate on nuclear disarmament ( corbyn 's radically in favour whilst the right wing of the party is radically against ) but got overruled ( which i did n't even know was possible ) . 
  this made the news for several days . 
  it 's unclear whether this is a victory or not for corbyn . 
  on the one hand it potentially makes him look weak and his party look divided , but on the other hand it did start somewhat of a discussion nationally about the issue ( which was likely the original intent ) whilst avoiding more seriously dividing his party , which would happen if they were to discuss it openly . 
  corbyn 's leadership speech was pretty good , but did n't really contain that much new . 
  just whilst i 'm talking about labour : i attended a talk ( not at conference ) by a former front bench labour mp , dr tristram hunt . 
  he 's radically on the right of the party and even looked as though he was going to run for party leader following the general election . 
  the speech itself was kind of dry and boring ( as you 'd expect from somebody who 's somewhat had the rug pulled out from under his feet quite suddenly ) but i was surprised to find that he was in favour of proportional representation so long as it retains single seat constituencies . 
  he praised the german model on this . 
  it 's extremely surprising to hear this coming from somebody at the front of one of the uk 's two major political parties . 
  typically , all the small parties ( lib dems , greens and even ukip ) support electoral reform whilst the two large parties ( labour and conservatives ) do n't , and want the system to stay as it is because it benefits them . 
  even jeremy corbyn is not particularly supporting electoral reform . 
  yet tristram hunt does . 
  how strange . 
  the conservative party conference was the last one , but i 'd honestly lost interest by this point . 
  all i remember is some silly pictures of [ the chancellor ( george osborne ) ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/multimedia/archive/00989/3c1bf6e6-6d30-11e5-_989750b.jpg ) and the [ home secretary ( theresa may ) ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2015/10/7/1444233192084/0b8ccfa2-d8e1-4c70-bbfa-bb53d7c64454-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&amp;q=85&amp;auto=format&amp;sharp=10&amp;s=20d2e8d2f208b8b65e0128455e5965d6 ) ( or finance minister and secretary of the interior , which is what these jobs are called in most european countries ) with their legs widely splayed in a way which only made them look stupid . 
  there was also a [ caricature of david cameron with the lectern as a pig snout ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cd2fff89480c0b09bb1d90d91fb0d9f3e0dd15b/0_0_650_444/master/650.jpg?w=620&amp;q=85&amp;auto=format&amp;sharp=10&amp;s=6974115d130bf9144ebf1eef2df083b4 ) . 
  apart from that , it was just a lot of behind-the-scenes jostling for who will succeed david cameron is the next prime minister . 
  but that 's all behind doors . 
  i 've only been doing it for a few months now . 
  and when i say `` doing it '' i 've probably only done it once a week or less . 
  the first one or two times you do it , it 's a bit of a mess and it does n't turn out great , but by the third time everything 's fine . 
  just order these basic ingredients and utensils and get started * nori ( seaweed strips ) * sushi rise ( or any east asian type of rice , such as korean or thai ) * mirin ( it 's a sort of rice wine vinegar ) * a frying pan + lid * a rolling mat * random oddments of food ( cucumber , prawn , ham , cream cheese , tuna , salmon , beef , pepper , are all especially good ingredients which are likely to be found in a typical european fridge ) the recipe sounds complicated but is simple after the first try . 
  i 'm adding copious amounts of detail here . 
  if you want to cook it , just follow these bullet points and you 'll make really good sushi . 
  if anything goes wrong , that 's just part of the fun . 
  * get rice ( usually about one cup 's worth ) * put rice in bowl * put water in bowl * use sieve to separate rice from water * repeat the previous two steps about four times * cook the rice ( by adding the rice plus one and a half cups of water to the frying pan - boil until water evaporates ) . 
  * remove cooked rice into a bowl * stir ( or ` fold ' to be precise ) 3 table spoons of mirin into the rice ( or 2 table spoons of mirrin and one of rice wine , if you 're fancy ) * stir ( or fold ) 2 tea spoons of sugar and one tea spoon of salt into the rice * low out your rolling mat * low piece of nori ( seaweed ) on the rolling mat * add rice onto the nori and spread evenly ( it helps if you spread it evenly only on the side closest you though , but that 's just a detail ) * add random oddments of food into the middle of the patch of rice . 
  * tap water ( hot ) water onto the edge of the nori ( like you 're licking a letter to seal it ) * roll the nori ( this is the dangerous part ) * prepare a cup of boiled water * dab knife in boiling water * use knife to cut sushi into segments, 
  it is , but it 's not always prominent enough for you to notice . 
  i live in sheffield which got eu development funds to build an inter city tram . 
  it says it 's done using european money at either end of the tram but i 'd been using the thing to years before i even noticed the sign . 
  and even then it was only because somebody told me it was built with eu funds so i was deliberately looking, 
  i 've been very into making sushi over the past few weeks and i think i 've got it nailed down . 
  i know it 's not european , but i am and i live in europe so here it is . 
  [ here 's the results of my most recent batch ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/sxmyt ) . 
  it 's not the best batch i 've done , but it 's alright . 
  i 'm considering progressing onto more complex stuff but i 'm not sure how to figure out where to learn how to make different types of sushi ( like the back-t-front rice ones or the salmon and rice balls attached together by a small nori belt ) . 
   surely , if the mods are busy you can still talk about something else ? 
  btw : i think the improvement in quality of the front page has equal amounts to do with adding the new mods as it does with the end of summer . 
  with the end of summer we get new news again , for once . 
  in the uk it 's party conference season and all of our parliaments are back in operation . 
  paging / u/dclauzel for a response . 
  how do you feel about a former french vassal rejecting your own cultural superiority ? 
  [ you mean running it corruptly ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal ), 
  the allies in this article include * wolfgang sch\u00e4uble ( finance minister ) . 
  * basically entirety of the csu ( christian social union ) which is essentially the branch of merkel 's party ( the cdu , christian democratic union ) which runs in elections in bavaria . 
  their leader , seehofer , has been strongly against this policy since near the beginning . 
  there 's also much scepticism even from members of the cdu 's government coalition partners , the spd ( social democratic party of germany ) such as * malu dreyer , the governor/first minister of the federal state of reihnland and * thomas oppermann ( no idea who he is ) . 
  also unsaid , is * thomas de maiziere , who is the secretary of the interior ( home secretary ) which is one of the top 4 most powerful offices in the country ( along with finance minister , foreign secretary and chancellor ) . 
  god damnit . 
  how do all these elections keep sneaking up on me ? 
  last week it was catalonia and i had * no idea * that elections were due . 
  now portugal too !, 
  what electoral system are you using in portugal if there are so many scenarios for majority governments without majorities of the votes ? 
  last thing : what are the full names of all these parties ? 
  i want to look them up and see which european political groupings they are constituents of , so i know where they fall broadly on the ideological spectrum ( socialist , social democrat , liberal , green , conservative , nationalist , et al ) . 
  that is ** not ** what the information shows . 
  here 's the key , plus english translation , with my added emphasis . 
  purple : protestant [ evangelical ] , yellow : catholic , ** blue : unaffiliated ( and other religions or no answer ) . 
  ** dark : absolute majority (  50 % ) . 
  light : plurality [ relative majority ] ( 33,3 - 50 % ) blue includes essentially * everything * which is not protestant christianity or catholic christianity . 
  you can see that there exists a significant demographic divide between east and west using this map , but you can not really see what the differences on each side of that divide are , nor the extent of that divide . 
  yes , atheism does have a * much * stronger influence in the east than the former western bundesl\u00e4nder ( federal states ) but this chart does n't prove that . 
  this chart proves nothing about atheism whatsoever . 
  no meaningful information about the presence of atheism can be found using this map . 
  it 's useful for catholicism and protestantism , but nothing else because it groups muslims , hindus , eastern orthodox christianity , and atheism ( as well as similar points of view such as agnosticism and humanism ) * and * all forms of non-organised spirituality into * one huge category * . 
  yes i am . 
  there 's more than one kind of capitalism . 
  would you say that the uk is n't capitalist because it taxes the wealthiest at 40 % and has a national health service ? 
  of course you would n't . 
  the uk is obviously capitalist . 
  just because it 's not 100 % completely libertarian capitalism with no limits does n't mean it 's not capitalism . 
  even china is capitalist . 
  even the uk of 1970s , with its nationalised steel industry and railways was capitalist because fundamentally people were still going around and working for wages . 
  that 's capitalism ; working for wages and working for money . 
  the diversity of different sets of rules within that system is enormous . 
  i 'm just recommending we give our rules a small tweak . 
  it 's nothing we have n't done a million times before and these tweaks are the only way to find the perfect model of capitalism . 
  it 's like trying to find the perfect car , or more topically , the perfect house . 
  there 's so many different varieties - you 've just got to pick one, 
  well , that 's an incredibly complicated question . 
  i wrote out a very long economics focused answer talking about positional goods , and goods which people have a right to ( and goods which are both ) . 
  but i accidentally deleted it ^ :( what i will say is that we already tax savings through inflation of the currency . 
  that is , the central bank ( be that the bank of england , the european central bank or the federal reserve board or any other central bank ) prints money which the government spends . 
  but the more money the central bank prints , the less value your savings have . 
  central banks across the world aim for 2 % inflation per year , which means that each euro in your safety deposit box ( physical euros , that is ) becomes worth 2 % less each . 
  so hard currency is becoming worth less and less all the time through this type of stealth tax . 
  the reasons for this is that if you hide euros under your mattress then they 're not out in the economy creating real value ( as well as financial value ) . 
  but this is where it starts getting complicated : if you put it in a bank account everything works completely different to keeping it under your mattress . 
  if you put money in a bank then they do n't just lock it away . 
  what they do is they spend it out in the world on investments which make the bank more money . 
  banks usually only have a very small amount of the money they 're keeping safe for people available at any one time . 
  so if everyone came and demanded their money at once then they would n't be able to dispense it . 
  so in response to the question `` what 's the difference between forcing people to spend their savings for the greater good and forcing them to use their property for the greater good '' i would answer that the only difference is we do that already with your savings but not with property . 
  i 'm simply saying we should do the same with property as we do with savings .
