  no it does n't . 
  it reduces the financial value . 
  and as i 've already explained , monetary/financial value is of little interest . 
  when you 're making money exclusively off of the speculation ( that is , buying things and waiting for them to increase in monetary value ) you 're not creating anything . 
  you 're not making anybody 's lives any better . 
  you 're just gaming the system . 
  the point of capitalism is to incentivise people to work and to make other people 's lives better ( on exchange for financial reward ) . 
  speculation does n't do any of this . 
  it 's just a drain on other resources . 
  so no real value is being destroyed . 
  only financial value is being reduced . 
  and i have no problem with that . 
  you ca n't let the market determine morals . 
  from what i understand , there 's already things available for all native born germans who are homeless . 
  least that 's what i 've heard . 
  no idea if it 's true . 
  of course . 
  that 's a completely legitimate fear and we should ensure that it does n't happen . 
  ** however ** we should n't let fear of going to far stop us from doing the right thing and making the right decision . 
  it could go too far , but the argument also works in the other direction . 
  we could live in a socialist society and be saying `` we do n't want to introduce private property because it may lead to houses being vacant whilst there are homeless on the streets '' . 
  and they 'd be right to be cautious too , but neither us not these hypothetical socialists should do nothing . 
  we should move towards that proper balance between market regulation and capitalism . 
  neither completely free capitalism not complete anti-capitalism has the answer . 
  it 's in the middle and we should always endeavour to find that perfect equilibrium . 
  you 're right . 
  i got my terms back to front . 
  what i should have said is ` if you 're not using it to ** create real value ** ( but are instead just owning it to wait for its ** price ** to increase ) ** ' the monetary value will increase over time by itself , but no real value will be created . 
  you 'll make money , but all you 've done to do it is buy something and do literally nothing with it . 
  that 's a waste of potential . 
  that 's wasting potential value which could have been created ( i.e. 
  by using the empty building to help run a business or to house people , both of which create real value , even if it 's not necessarily monetary value ) . 
  the terms are deliberately confusing to make one conflate value with worth and visa versa . 
  hope i made myself more clear, 
  that 's such a stupid argument . 
  that 's like saying hitler was a vegetarian therefore being a vegetarian is bad . 
  yeah , communism has n't worked very well either , but i 'm not advocating communism just like vegetarians are n't advocating nazism . 
  just because communist did n't work well does n't mean that you should fly off the handle on the other direction and completely deny that anything it might have done could have been good . 
  the real solution is somewhere in between the estremes . 
   uhm only german ones , they 'd be good . 
  i speak german . 
  if it 's too much bother it 's fine - i 'd just love to read about it in more detail because it 's an issue with a lot of ignorance surrounding it . 
  edit : just thought i 'd thank you as well for the information you 've already provided . 
  well then what you mean is forced purchase . 
  confiscation would be illegal , and also imply that the original owner got zero compensation . 
  the original owner is getting compensation , therefore it is not confiscation . 
  it 's forced purchase . 
  words matter . 
  do n't call something what it 's not, 
   and work while living decently hah , you 're aware there was a huge campaign in the uk for a living wage , because currently many people who work full time jobs do n't earn enough to live decently . 
   alcocholism/drug addiction or chosen lifestyle i just want to point out that addiction is not a chosen life style . 
  i know that 's not what you 're saying , but it just needs to be painted out very clearly that addiction is not a choice . 
  that 's why they do n't call it ` liking drugs ' . 
  they call it addiction because it is not free . 
  you ability to make decisions when you are addicted is severely inpaired . 
  those who have addictions should be treated like all other people with disabilities . 
  they should be helped , not harmed . 
  this is great news . 
  pointless speculation on the property market has caused a lot of problems . 
  humans should have a right to a home . 
  that right is in conflict with a company 's right to speculate on property . 
  the individual should win . 
  unfortunately the rules of capitalism in europe have not allowed this . 
  if the rules of the game are unfair then you should change them, 
  property is a finite and essential resource for the livelihoods of human beings . 
  if one person owns a piece of property that limits the amount of it that other people can have . 
  with produceable items , this does n't matter so much . 
  you can produce theoretically infinite amounts of good , for instance . 
  so if you eat a carrot , that does n't mean that somebody else ca n't have a carrot . 
  so there 's not really a problem with buying up carrots in order to sell them later for a profit ( when demand for carrots has increased ) . 
  with property on the other hand , if one person decides to buy up all the property in the world and just sit on it , without making use of it , then there are people who are being deprived of their ability to have a house because somebody else is just sitting on it doing nothing . 
  that is a failure with the rules of capitalism as we know it today and should definitely be re-written . 
  with stocks and shares it 's different , because those are organisations , rather than physical things ( although they may own physical things ) .

  you 're aware this is actually quite common in western countries ? 
  in the uk they 're called forced purchase orders , but you actually get a pretty good pay out . 
  it 's necessary sometimes to use them if you 've got some huge infrastructure project . 
  for instance , in the uk there 's a proposed project called high speed two which will extent the channel tunnel euro star service all the way up to birmingham and sheffield . 
  it 's going to require a fair few houses and businesses to move . 
  obviously the route should be changed when and where possible , but often it is n't possible , which is when they use forced purchase orders . 
  so it 's not really exclusively a ussr thing . 
  they serve a very distinct purpose around the world , especially in the developed western european countries .

  that 's quite interesting . 
  do you have any links to further reading ? 
  when you actually put it like that it does n't sound so bad .
