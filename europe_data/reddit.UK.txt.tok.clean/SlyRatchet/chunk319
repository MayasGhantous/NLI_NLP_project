  afterwards , from the period 1961 to the 80s there were only about 5,000 individuals who migrated through . 
  that 's not 0 , but it is a huge drop . 
  that said , we have to bear in mind the sorts of things that east germany was actually doing to maintain that . 
  they had to have border guards literally willing to kill people if they approach the border ( and did so , on many occasions ) . 
  the east germans also had mass surveillance and could imprison your families if you were to attempt to escape ( not unlike north korea ) . 
  and all of this is without considering the phenomenal costs of building and maintaining the thing ( remember : one of the major reasons for the collapse of the soviet union and the east bloc was financial ) . 
  it would also naturally incur difficulties for our citizens trying to go the other way ( at least in the instance of the uk , if we want to stop eu migrants coming here , then the eu will be sceptical about letting our citizens go there ) . 
  so the real question is not ` would it work ' but instead ` at what cost , in terms of morality , rights and economics ? 
   original . 
  always find it really interesting that they included the borders of germany from the 1920s and 1930s on there , and refer to k\u00f6nigsberg / kaliningrad as though it 's still part of germany . 
  the thing is , if it was so undemocratically operated , why has n't someone taken the issue to caught ? 
  the organisation has a contract with its members and and obligation to fulfil . 
  if it 's not then surely it can be sued . 
  the same thing happened with the labour party in the uk a few months ago when they were deliberately depriving members of voting ( because the establishment believed them to be pro-corbyn ) . 
  i 'll have a look at the wikileaks files but i 'll take as much direction as i can :p there is a fair few of them , afterall . 
  i 'm curious to see the evidence that she rigged the primaries . 
  i 've seen it often asserted but never actually demonstrated . 
  i think the un is a pretty good compromise between idealism and pragmatism . 
  some states * are * more equal than others . 
  you ca n't deny that . 
  the un has helped bind those states into an international legal system where they allow other states a say . 
  if we abolished the un today i do n't have high hopes of a more egalitarian organisation replacing it . 
  progress can only be gradual . 
  the united nations : specifically , a mixture of the [ general assembly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly ) and the [ un security council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council ) . 
  as you can see from glancing at [ this pdf ] ( http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_anderson_2.pdf ) the process can be quite complex and convoluted . 
  also worth noting that being religious does not preclude being part of the enlightenment . 
  for much of european history , the main driver of scientific advancement have been religious monks . 
  only a handful of the great enlightenment thinkers were atheists , and the overwhelming majority believed and practiced a former of christianity . 
  and what 's more , european culture is also bound in christian values , even if it is not bound in christianity * per se * . 
  so to say that poland/polish culture is not ` european ' because it is strongly catholic is just preposterous . 
  depends how you view international law . 
  you can take the view that law only applies on the states who choose for it to apply to them , or the view that international law is binding regardless . 
  i lean towards the latter , because other wise you end up with situations where one state can commit genocide and say ` but i 'm not breaking international law because i never signed up to the ` genocide is bad ' treaty ! ' . 
  international law should apply everywhere , regardless , especially on issues which effect the whole world ( such as nuclear weapons proliferation , or climate change , or human rights ) . 
  there is a un treaty known as the [ treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_non-proliferation_of_nuclear_weapons ) which bans countries from developing or acquiring nuclear weapons . 
  all countries which already had nuclear weapons by the time the treaty came into force were allowed to keep them ( usa , ussr/russia , uk , france , china ) as it would be near impossible to get them to agree to remove them completely ( not that they have n't tried ) . 
  all states to acquire nuclear weapons after this point are therefore doing so against international law . 
  every country in the world is a signatory to the treaty , except for india , pakistan , israel and south sudan ( and with s sudan , that 's more because they have n't got round to it yet ) . 
  worth noting that in the uk we already have the beginnings of just such a movement . 
  there 's the [ european movement ] ( http://euromove.org.uk/what-we-do/who-we-are/ ) which has existed since winston churchill . 
  there 's also the youth wing [ students for europe/youth for europe ] ( http://studentsforeurope.org/ ) . 
  on the continent i 'm not quite sure if there 's a standard ` pro-europe ' organisation without it being explicitly federalist in nature ( not that there 's anything wrong with being a federalist ) . 
  for instance , there 's [ jef , die junge europ\u00e4ische f\u00f6deralisten ( the young european federalists ) ] ( https://www.jef.de/ ) which is active europe wide . 
  these organisations are all relatively well established ( some more than others ) and i 'd recommend at least getting in touch with them . 
  lots of them already have very good funding and organisational capacity so even if you do n't want to become a part of them directly , they may be able to offer help ( e.g. 
  the jef frequently gives financial help to youth for europe , even though jef is explicitly federalists and yfe is explicitly * not * federalist ) . 
  i was like ` ew , ew , ew , ew , ew ' until the end where you mention that it 's $ 22 to cross all of bulgaria and romania and now i 'm like * frantically googles ` holidays in romania ' * anyone wan na give me a crash course in romanian ? 
  this map does n't seem right but i do n't know enough about the world outside the united kingdom to dispute it . 
  hey !, 
  [ cool guys do n't look at explosions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqz5dbs5zmo ), 
  i think boatymcboatface is the best reason against direct democracy, 
  are they anything like the other green parties around europe ? 
  that 's how it works currently , however there has been some signs from eu leaders that they are willing to bend the rules . 
  which is a good thing . 
  when issues are this important you should n't arbitrarily stick to rules for their own sake if changing them would provide concrete benefits . 
  the eu parliament 's chief brexit negotiator has already said that if scotland votes to leave that it should have automatic eu membership . 
  would have liked more detail on how the eu plans to advance the space industry . 
  but what they do say is encouraging . 
  lots of talk of `` the final frontier '' and cooperation , and that britain will still be contributing to thr esa despite brexit . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it is not on-topic for this subreddit . 
  see [ community rules & guidelines ] ( / r/europe/wiki / community_rules ) . 
  if you have any questions about this removal , please [ contact the mods ] ( / message/compose / ? to = / r/europe & subject = moderation ) . 
   mr. papaconstantinou became the greek finance minister during the greek financial crisis i think you 'll find it 's called the # ** grisis ** # which was followed eventually by the * greferendum * but unlike in britain there was no * grexit *, 
  because a lack of electric cars is n't causing climate change . 
  it 's the presence of c02 emissions which is causing that . 
  and that is caused by non-electric cars . 
  so to stop c02 emissions you need to remove the source , which includes petrol cars . 
  producing more electric cars do n't stop climate change . 
  only using less petrol will . 
  that 's why you have to ban instead of incentivise . 
  incentives cause more of something . 
  bans cause less of it . 
  to be fair , when i learn languages i tend to pick up a phrase book and just read through them . 
  it 's good to do when you 've got some spare time but are too tired to do anything that requires much attention ( like a proper book ) . 
  afterwards , you can sort of half remember the phrases and can repeat them with maybe 70 % accuracy , which is usually good enough . 
  it 's also just useful for learning how particular phrases work ( e.g. 
  i 've learned from looking at op 's image that the word for ` english speaking ' is ` engelstatlge ' , and i can now apply that in all sorts of other dutch sentences ) . 
  i 'd say that sanctions is used so often to refer to economic sanctions and so rarely to anything else that i think the other part of the definition is effectively void now . 
  the language has evolved . 
  may as well think of a better way of phrasing it . 
  easy there donald, 
   i am serj tankian from system of a down . 
  along with other artist friends i have composed a statement and call to action , called justice within armenia , on change.org highlighting necessary democratic reforms in armenia . 
  ** ask me anything except for when system is making another record ** , 
  as someone who knows very little about armenia : why do you feel qualified to publicly push for reform within armenia , and how will this help improve armenia ? 
  maybe , but then pretty much all ex east bloc states started doing that , but then some like moldova , belarus , russia , and ukraine are still doing badly . 
  well someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, 
  personally i am an internationalist/cosmopolitan . 
  i 've got nothing against nationalism most of the time , but when people start supporting their country even when their country is doing bad things , or doing things at the direct expense of the rest of the world ( especially parts of the world which ca n't defend themselves ) , i find it hard to understand how you can be okay with that . 
  surely the most fundamental moral principle is that all people are created equal . 
  all people deserve a good standard of life just as much as anyone else . 
  i 've never heard a satisfactory * moral * explanation for why we should care for people in our own country more than those in other ones . 
  they 're all equal . 
  because sometimes some people 's countries do bad things . 
  i 'd say germans in 1940s should n't support their country , and neither should north koreans today . 
  we should try and achieve the best for people regardless of country . 
  so , tell me more about these commissions . 
  are they like parliamentary committees in the uk , but with more executive powers ? 
  how are positions on these commissions allocated ? 
  ( also , i speak german if you want to write in that , or if there is any specialised german vocabulary which helps explain it ) .
