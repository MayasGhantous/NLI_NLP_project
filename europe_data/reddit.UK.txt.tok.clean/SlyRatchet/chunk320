  they 're run consensually ? 
  how does that work ? 
  this article quotes three separate , elected afd politicians saying that . 
  kill women and children who approach the german border . 
  great policy !, 
  i 'd be up for it . 
  i 'd obviously remove any and all things which could personally identify me and maybe even use a throwaway , but it would be interesting even then . 
  a lot of stuff you did n't realise is different always pops up when you share these sorts of ordinary life things, 
  we say sorry more than the canadians do !, 
  where do you think they got it from ? 
  there 's been countless times when someone has dropped something nearby me and * i * apologised . 
  most british people have similar anecdotes . 
  * you can take our women , you can take our money , you can take our sovereignty , but you can never take our sorries !, 
  it 's mostly symbolic stuff like that , yeah + whenever schools go abroad or city council wants to strengthen relationships with a foreign country , they will tend to choose a sister city . 
  in sheffield we 're twinned with bochum , germany which has a [ big , fuckoff bell ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/nrw,_bochum_-_rathaus,_the_bell.jpg ) in the middle of town . 
  and in sheffield we have a [ tiny bell ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4c/af/dc/filename-057-web-jpg.jpg ) ( this one is on a random patch of wall , almost hidden behind a tree ) , to commemorate their big one . 
  it 's little things like that which kind of make it nice . 
  whenever i 'm back in sheffield i often think of bochum in a way i would n't if it was just another city i happened to visit on a school trip .

  people make a lot out of the differences in policy of the different member states , but i do n't think evidence of disagreement is a fundamental road block . 
  differences of opinion will always occur , even within unitary states . 
  the geographic divide within the uk is huge on issues of nuclear weapons , refugees , and economic policy , yet the uk is still a unitary state ( for the moment ) . 
  not really . 
  the way it works is like a pyramid . 
  specifically , [ this pyramid which illustrated here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vivhv ) all states participate in the bottom of the pyramid ( the eu army ) and therefore benefit from the efficiencies produced by this economy of scale , the ability to operate across the eu 's internal border , the increased overall size of the eu army . 
  all of this saves costs , increases effectiveness , and increases deterrence . 
  these benefits apply whether you 're a small , non-interventionist state like ireland or a large interventionist state like france . 
  if states want to take a more interventionist role in world affairs , then they are free to build on the foundations of the pyramid , but will have to do so at a national level . 
  everyone benefits from this type of european armed forces , whether you 're a small state or a large one . 
  and even the most reluctant eu members acknowledge the necessity of a domestic defence and of deterrence , along with the other pivotal benefits an eu army brings ( such as ensuring that eu members on russia 's border do n't end up like ukraine , and georgia ) . 
  so everyone agrees . 
  everyone benefits . 
  effectiveness is increased without limiting sovereignty . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  people often assume ( incorrectly ) that there can only be * either * an eu army * or * national armies . 
  this leads to the conclusion that all eu member states would need to agree when deploying the military abroad . 
  that is to say , heavily neutral countries like ireland and finland ( who are n't part of nato and tend to be sceptical or opposed to foreign wars ) would be incompatible with countries like the uk and france who are famous for their involvement in the iraq , afghanistan and libyan wars , amongst others . 
  if the existence of an eu army precluded the existence of national armies then this would indeed be a problem . 
  but it is n't so it wo n't . 
  the eu army would existence for instances of self-defence in the same way the eu battle groups do at the moment . 
  it would allow countries like france and ireland to cooperate on those domestic and near-abroad issues . 
  this would allow both countries to benefit as there 's no need for both countries to maintain independent deterrents . 
  that is to say , both nations wo n't need their own battalions of tanks nor fleets of ships . 
  this allows resources to be spared that can either go into other types of spending ( such as welfare or education ) or to a greater degree of specialisation . 
  the saved money could be used in research , counter-terrorism , special forces , greater variation of vehicles and vehicle units . 
  an eu army offers only benefits to the member states and its citizens . 
  she will if people vote !, 
  well , that 's assuming that in 2019 guy verhofstadt is n't their candidate again which he probably will be . 
  there 's a video of it if you follow the link, 
  me too !, 
  war with france is always the correct solution . 
  theresa may was for it , but then back tracked on the idea shortly before the referendum for reasons no one 's quite sure of , as she did so with as little noise as possible . 
  then she brexit happened and was like `` well ... this is embarrassing '' . 
  and here we are today .

  yeah , my only experience of east germany was east berlin , and even then it was n't much . 
  i spend most of my time in germany either in nr/wf , bavaria or austria . 
  not a big fan of the east . 
  the incumbent president is n't standing so i doubt the election will have much effect . 
  i mean , that can be said about almost anything . 
  i mean , surely women wearing bikinis ( as opposed to one piece swim suits or trunks ) is due to social pressures and the objectification of women by western , male dominated society , just as much as women from arab cultures are . 
  and surely choosing your ( secular ) values is also largely through social pressure . 
  do you support liberty because you have arrived at it through pure reason , reading widely ( authors such as js mill ) and also reading and contemplating the counter point of view ( such as that exposed by edmund burke , oakshott , gentile , rosenberg , marx , et al ) ? 
  or do you support liberty because you grew up in a society where values such as freedom of expression and of choice are pervasive ? 
  are you honestly calling the times left wing ? 
  [ they 've supported the tories in almost every election ] ( https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/site_furniture/2010/5/4/1272980216414/party-support-in-general--004.jpg ) ever and the sunday times supported brexit . 
  unless boris johnson and michael gove are now considered `` lieftists '' ? 
  you ca n't just tar anyone you disagree with as a leftist . 
  it 's no better than calling anyone you disagree with a `` racist '' . 
  but that would require actually listening to what people have to say rather than just mud slinging . 
  the burkini was a way for muslim women to go out and participate in french society whilst also adhering to their own freely chosen values . 
  banning the burkini just makes it more difficult for muslim women to go to the beach . 
  the burkini is a liberator , not an oppressor . 
  banning women from wearing a burkini is just as bad as if not worse than forcing women to wear them in the first place . 
  they should be allowed to choose for themselves . 
  there 's a lot of talk about ` jobs which require tertiary qualifications [ degrees ] ' and jobs which do n't , but i 'm not sure it 's that simple . 
  for instance , half of my degree is in political analysis and most politics graduates at my university go on to work straight away as assistants to mps , researchers at think tanks , working for ngos , et al. . 
  there are often people in these organisations who have no degree . 
  i know mps ' assistants who only has gcses . 
  the thing is , those people tend to be older whilst those with degrees bypass the real life experience required because doing a degree provides you with most of that relevant information . 
  so having a degree is often a replacement for getting a decade 's experience elsewhere . 
  it 's like taking a speed boost in mario cart . 
  if you see degrees merely as a `` boost '' up the career ladder ( what particular career that is ) rather than a pre-requisite then the whole idea of ` being in a job that requires a tertiary level qualification ' is defunct . 
  you wan na know the worst thing about the eurozone crisis ? 
  everyone constantly predicting the end of the euro . 
  i would love that !, 
  i need to start reading more german keep progress/avoid regressing . 
  you can leave them as an ordinary comment as i 'm sure there are other non-swiss german speakers that would be interested . 
  germanic studies student here : any swiss or nearby people wan na give input on this ? 
  the first i am hearing about this is from the bbc so i 'd love some links to swiss news on the issue ( neue z\u00fcricher zeitung , usw . ), 
  edit : some excellent information that was pm 'd to my by zero_degree  basically the party svp wants to ban all people entering swiss except for people that do work for swiss people , but refugees would n't be welcome . 
  you can see that on their website http://www.masseneinwanderung.ch/content/argumente/wer-soll-in-die-schweiz-kommen-duerfen.html  here is an article talking about the voting in 2014 http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/svp-initiative-im-aargau-auf-ja-kurs-1.18239183  up to date they seem to not have done anything with the voting , so it is just the opinion of the voting people  also they seem to see their chances to get something out if it diminish , since they did n't do anything in those almost 3 years , and now gb wants to do something similar http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/aktuelle-themen/rasa-il-verlinken-mit-efta-ld.92032  things that could happen , economically http://www.handelszeitung.ch/konjunktur/schweiz/diese-fuenf-folgen-hat-der-brexit-fuer-die-schweiz-1124632  http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/schweiz-folgt-auf-den-brexit-der-schwexit-a-1104255.html what would happen , can they do it ?
