  yeah !, 
  south yorkshire beats west yorkshire 's ass !, 
  definitely agree . 
  i think the worst is yet to come . 
  still , i think it 's worth acknowledging that not all economic data needs to be spun as bad news . 
  there 's nothing really about brexit here so i do n't think there 's much pointing shoe horning it in . 
  as you say , no one is predicting consumer spending to be hit until some time next year . 
  the thing is consumer spending is up compared to * the same period last year * . 
  basically showing that the brexit vote has had no immediate effect on consumer spending, 
  and this is one of the many reasons nato 's 2 % of gdp recommendation is silly . 
  well , he could win if he gets enough support to make it to the second round and le pen is the opponent . 
  the news articles about trump are directly and in many cases explicitly about europe , i.e. 
  the headline reads some [ `` trump 's comments leave some ** european ** leaders worried about the future of nato '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4u1jag/trumps_comments_leave_some_european_leaders/ ) . 
  the word european itself is used in the headline . 
  and in any case , nato is an organisation which european countries make up a majority of the members of . 
  directly mentioning nato or nato 's european member states directly relates to europe . 
  we 're not saying that syria does n't effect europe . 
  that 's something for the commenters to decide . 
  what we are saying is that there is a point where saying `` this effects/relates to europe in someway '' is expanded so broadly that * anything * can be seen to related to/effect europe . 
  people have been arguing that the fact roman and ancient greek buildings are in syria relate it to europe , but that can be said for almost every single country on the planet . 
  likewise , the events in every single country around the world will have an economic or social effect on europe , because we live in globalised times . 
  if we were to include this based on the grounds that it is ` related ' or ` effects ' europe than we would be stretching those two words so far that they could mean anything , and when words could mean anything they mean nothing . 
  so a line has been drawn where those words retain their meaningfulness and including this post would go well past that line where meaningfulness is lost .

  we apologise that it remained on the subreddit for an hour and made it to the front page before we could correct the mistake .

  seeing as it 's unlikely this post is gon na get a huge deal of attention ( if a lot of users start flocking , please message me so i can delete this as the mods do n't want their delicate subs to become overburdened suddenly ) i 'll link to a few . 
  / r/geopolitics and / r/syriancivilwar are perhaps the best places for in depth articles . 
  i 'll admit that i do n't spend a huge deal of time in those places because the content is just too taxing to read often and regularly . 
  may want to have a second look at that translation . 
  ` zug der liebe ' does not mean `` train of love '' but `` move of love '' as in a move in a boardgame . 
  although a [ love train is certainly a fun thought ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr45dmzdjsc ) and oddly quite fitting of a pride event . 
  it is an opinion piece . 
  i do n't think there 's such a thing as objective opinion . 
  additionally , seeing as this is written by a very senior academic , i consider it a good thing that they are putting forward their view strongly . 
   laszlo bruszt is professor of sociology at the scuola normale superiore in florence and at the central european university in budapest . 
  nauro campos is professor of economics at brunel university london , a research fellow at iza-bonn , and a research professor at eth-z\u00fcrich .

  which is interesting , because it means that our improved access to information is actually increasing the effects of terrorism , even though what 's actually being done by terrorists is the same or diminished compared to what it was in previous decades . 
  relevant quote :  `` the idea is that they will go back to syria one day and help with the reconstruction '' of their war-shattered country , von der leyen told the newspaper . 
  i think `` came out for remain '' is a bit strong . 
  in the podcast he admits to having not really thought about it , but that when push comes to shove he leans towards remain . 
  he also says that he is planning on researching it more to come to a real opinion . 
  he also did n't say whether he would actually bother voting or not ( cgpgrey does n't vote , much to the anguish of many people ) . 
  maybe we could give more power to the council and the parliament ? 
  could work if we take the power away from the commission and essentially turn the eu into a prime ministerial system ( rather than a presidential/mixed system ) where the head of eu government sits inside the parliament . 
  but on the other hand also give right of legislative initiative ( right to propose legislation ) to the council and possibly parliament too . 
   cabinet members are also members of parliament , rather than unelected appointees . 
  well , they can also be members of the house of lords , which is a mixture of appointed and hereditary life peers . 
  so , you can just make someone a lord and then make the a minister , all without an election being held . 
  it 's happened before . 
  i think it 's 12 midday , rather than 12 midnight . 
  there 's always ambiguity as to whether midday should be 12pm or 12am . 
  non tariff barriers/divergent regulatory standards . 
  i think i got the catherine bearder ama the same way . 
  just randomly tweeted her and randomly got a positive reply . 
  unless they 're refugees . 
  the actual pretences for using article 7 ( human dignity , freedom , etc. ), 
  do n't matter . 
  there 's no judge who 's going to overrule the european council ( even the european court of justice would n't ) because the council is the supreme legislative body . 
  what matters is that all 27 members agree to vote on article 7 against the uk . 
  that comes down to pure politics . 
  is it in the interests of all member states ? 
  poland and hungary may be difficult , because their governments have tended to be more sympathetic to the uk ( poland and uk 's govts are both part of the ecr faction , and uk and hungary are the only two members to vote against appointing jean-claude juncker as commission president ) and may at some point in the future want to ensure that an exit option is on the table ( especially if the central european countries try and force ever closer union on them , now that the eurosceptic uk is n't there to counter balance it ) . 
  and also just generally the remaining 27 may be reluctant to use it because it 's just never ever been used before . 
  politicians do n't like breaking with conventions unless they need to . 
  well , quite a few major european nations do n't allow dual-nationality , for instance germany does n't allow it except under very rare circumstances and neither does austria . 
  same . 
  i know a lot of people who 've already applied for irish citizenship , and i 'm applying for german citizenship based on my jewish heritage . 
  well , she 's also from the former eastern bloc , which is one of the regions which is being toted for the next secretary general ( two of the key contenders are from bulgaria ) . 
  also , the un is thinking it 's time for a female leader ( of which the two bulgarians are ) . 
  was n't cleared with the mods before hand and does n't come in the form of a text post . 
  if you want to to format a text post and then send it to us privately we 'll consider it , but no guarantee . 
  otherwise , we risk letting this place become a spam happy centre for every ttip , net-neutrality , copy right , or whatever petition imaginable . 
  we have to be very selective with what petitions are allowed otherwise it very quickly degrades . 
  there 's a procedure . 
  use it . 
  the economist was discussing having merkel as the next secretary general of the united nations . 
  interesting prospect . 
  i would n't mind merkel as the next president of the european council or of the commission either .

  my point is that it 's hypothetically possible , not that this was a good way to do it . 
   even then , in this ridiculous case , you 're effectively slowing the services they could be getting - your customers would almost certainly want the bandwidth of that extra cable used , regardless of which service they 're accessing . 
  that 's not really a fair comparison . 
  you 're essentially criminalising companies for investing their earnings . 
  well , it 's not possible in most of europe at the moment , but it 's not inherently impossible . 
  for instance , an internet company could just build new cables alongside existing cables and charge more for use of those than the others . 
  i do n't think it 's unreasonable to write legislation that allows space for new technological developments in the future .
