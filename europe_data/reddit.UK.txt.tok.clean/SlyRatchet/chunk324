  well , if you 're not interested in an actual answer to the question you asked that 's fine too . 
   why are you doing a ama here instead of / r/ukpolitics ? 
  in a word : size . 
  ukpolitics has about 40,000 subscribers where as here there are 770,000 of which the largest contingent are british . 
  the ama has been publicised on the other subreddits . 
  depends what you mean be work with . 
  there will still be cooperation but what matters is the extent . 
  for instance , would the pr\u00fcm convention ( where eu members agree to automatically share all dna data with police forces of other member states immediately ) have happened without the eu ? 
  or what about the european arrest warrant ? 
  we 'd likely still have some intelligence sharing and some use of rendition , but in this era of terrorism , is that really enough to prevent it ? 
  i 'd prefer more . 
  just an fyi : if you want your questions to get answered , you should probably make them ** concise ** . 
  or at least put your question at the top in bold or something with the rest of the text bellow . 
  brevity is a virtue . 
  everyone is very busy today as it is the last day of campaigning . 
  should we tell him that kerry is a vegan , and is the first mp to ever make the case for veganism in the house of commons ? 
  i 'd actually say that ttip and the referendum are heavily linked issues . 
  [ e.g. 
  ] ( http://www.anothereurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ttip-leaflet-for-screen-viewing-page-001.jpg ), 
  why has the pro-remain argument failed to adequately explain how the eu 's economic area works , and what the difference between being a `` member '' of the european economic area means and what having `` access '' to the european economic area means ? 
  -- for those that do n't know : ` access ' means simply that you are allowed to trade with the area without having your imports and exports taxed . 
  it 's the most basic definition of ` free trade ' . 
  trade without tariffs . 
  on the other hand , being a ` member ' means that you eliminate other barriers to trade aside from the tariffs ( taxes ) . 
  essentially , this boils down to divergent consumer , worker and product standards . 
  if the usa decided that all eggs had to be cleaned in order for them to be fit to sell , but the eu/eea decided that eggs had to * not * be cleaned ( because it destroys their natural immune systems ) in order to be sold , then that means that eu-us trade in eggs would basically be non-existent ( and it is non-existent ) . 
  this means that if we want to have truly excellent trade then we need to eliminate these non-tariff barriers to trade . 
  that is why we ca n't simply leave the eu but continue to trade with it like we do today . 
  i mean , we * could * trade with the eea as a non-member but the independent [ institute for fiscal studies estimates that this would cause our economy to be 7 % smaller by the year 2030 ] ( http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/comms/r116.pdf ) , with much worse economic results in the short term . 
  there is no reasonable third-way . 
  it 's either in europe , in the eea , with a burgeoning economy and burgeoning trade or out of europe with a smaller economy , hurting the most vulnerable , isolating us , closing us off from our european family . 
  why has n't the remain campaign explained this ? 
  it 's pretty fundamental . 
  this could have been an opportunity to educate the public but instead we have capitulated to leave 's base arguments and allowed them to win at their own game . 
  which i also do n't get , because the eu allows us to get better trading deals quicker , not worse ones slower . 
  the eu is the world 's largest economy so we can make much bigger demands if anyone else in the world wants access . 
  the uk economy by itself is big , but not in a position where it can go and demand terms from china , india or the usa . 
  it infuriates me that the remain camp have not argued this point . 
  it 's fundamental . 
  brexit * is * about closing yourself off from the world and remain is about staying open . 
   how do i volunteer ? 
  you just did !, 
  [ much like he did in this radio phone-in debate with the labour leadership hopefuls ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrltlmfngvi ), 
  the thing is , if you look at the leave camp in the uk , they 're not simply distrustful of the realisation of the eu on any sort of reasonable grounds like that . 
  they 're terrified of the very * idea * of a unified continent . 
  i 've seen quotes from some of them saying that it should be disbanded completely . 
  but really this sort of thing is secondary to the main reason i describe them as ` phobic ' : because they are scared of other europeans . 
  nigel farage himself has said that he would n't want a romanian family moving in next door . 
  i mean , he appears in front of billboards [ like this ] ( http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8233267.ece/alternates/s615b/16-dec-2016-ukip-leader-nigel-farage.jpg ) . 
  there 's a reason that even moderate , centre-right organisations like the spectator ( longest continuously published magazine in the english language ) have drawn connections between the vote leave campaign and the assassination of jo cox mp . 
  i 'm not necessarily saying that 's the case , but the fact that such connections are being drawn by such people is emblematic of the extent of extremism in this debate . 
  there are logical and sound reasons for wanting to leave the eu . 
  there 's a strong argument to be made that the eu is not democratic enough and that elections of the commission president should be more direct . 
  there are structural flaws in the euro . 
  these are sound eurosceptic arguments . 
  what a lot of the british `` eurosceptic '' group are saying is not eurosceptic in its original sense , but instead europhobic . 
  sorry to keep replying but i just remembered we had an ama with [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gd9t1/i_was_a_member_of_the_european_parliament_for_29/ ) who 's a traditional eurosceptic , in the sense that he 's critical of the project and wants serious reform ( where as now eurosceptic actually means europhobic ) . 
  i mean , just regarding the epp directly , you have to realise that the main place we get speakers from is the european parliament , and federalists make up the overwhelming proportion of people there . 
  if you look at the diagram [ on this page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament ) and not that virtually everyone to the left of ecr is pro-eu if not outright federalist , you can see why it 's a little difficult to get speakers from them just in terms of numbers . 
  not to mention some of them ( farage ) have difficulty with computers , or so i 'm led to believe . 
  about a month ago . 
  i came to help with caroline lucas 's ama . 
  i know * of * many great leave politicians but i do n't know any of them in any personal capacity or have any sort of connection which can provide me with an ` in ' . 
  with richard corbett mep i got my `` in '' because i 'm one of his constituents and since his ama we have a working relationship that i can exploit to get more amas . 
  when i email their office now they recognise my account . 
  but the uk 's eurosceptic , right wing ? 
  i do n't have an ` in ' there . 
  if i call them up i 'm a stranger . 
  they do n't trust me and they do n't trust this `` reddit '' thing . 
  as i said in a different comment , we 've sent out emails and if they respond to us soon then we 'll put one in but it 's unlikely . 
  -- on the upside : we 've been contacted by the [ european people 's party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party ) ( the largest group in the european parliament ) and hopefully we 'll have an ama with one of their members post-referendum . 
  it 's a start !, 
  we sent emails out to the compaign groups that they 're both part of `` vote leave '' and `` grassroots out '' ( or is carswell actually part of vote leave instead ? ), 
  and gotten no or a negative response . 
  there 's no harm in sending out emails to them individually though . 
  i 'll do that right now . 
  if anyone knows or has contacts with any leave politicians then please put them in touch with us . 
  we 're all volunteers over here so we do n't have a lot of time to go around looking for interesting amaers . 
  and the few emails and calls which have been directed at leavers fell on deaf ears . 
  the group campaigning for a ` remain ' vote in britain 's referendum on eu membership have reached out to us in order to do an additional ama before the referendum . 
  we ca n't confirm exactly who it will be as of yet , except that they are considered to be quite senior . 
  keep your eyes peeled tomorrow !, 
  it 's not about fracking being particularly dangerous ( which i assume is you 're `` anti science '' comment ) . 
  it 's about gas being a fossil fuel which is contributing to climate change . 
  additionally , we should n't be investing money in natural gas instead of renewables . 
  renewable energy sources exist today and we have the technology to meet all of our electricity needs * today * . 
  any investment which goes into gas is an investment which should be going into renewables . 
  fracking my be good short term policy , but in the longterm it 's a bad , bad idea . 
  god damnit . 
  i like a lot of things about germany , but their `` putin versteher '' quality ends up being not enough `` verstehen '' and too much appeasement . 
  we 're already dependent on russia for oil . 
  why would we want to be dependent on them for lng too ? 
  better to just avoid it completely . 
  it 's not one person , it 's official ukip material from their local branch in hemel hempsted . 
  ** turks to steal our great british tea **, 
  edinburgh especially is predicted to be perhaps the most pro-eu district in the country . 
  we shall see . 
  and vegan cyclists, 
  got a lot of respect for trucidator . 
  basically the only brexiteer i 've actually had a coherent argument with .
