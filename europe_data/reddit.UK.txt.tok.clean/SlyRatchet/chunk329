  often hipsters using ` instagram ', 
  northern ireland actually voted remain !, 
  ( although not by a huge margin ) . 
  yeah , we 'd advertise big brother contestants ' sex tapes , acquired through phone hacking . 
  pretty significant for a single company, 
  agreed . 
  whilst being at times a somewhat controversial mod on this subreddit , i used to be very coy about my gender for the sake of anonymity . 
  it was interesting seeing the level of angry pms i got when people were n't sure about gender ( and be clearly evasive , which i was , often leads people to assume female ) as opposed to when i later made it clear i am male . 
  i can understand why some people do n't think that sexism is as big as some claim it is , but when people outright deny that male on female sexism exists at all , then i just do n't know what to say . 
  open your eyes !, 
  surprised it 's so high for the uk, 
  wot, 
  if schulz resigns his seat as an mep i think that she should run as the s&d 's candidate for commission president . 
  is vestager an s&d person or an alde person ? 
  if she 's s&d and schulz resigns to run for the german bundestag then s&d should totally make her their spitzenkandidat for the commission .

  that 's just not true . 
  the climate will only seriously start going down hill ( due to passing the ` point of no return ' ) when we reach 2 degrees c above pre-industrial levels . 
  we 're now at 1.6 degrees c above pre-industrial levels . 
  we still can easily solve this , but only if we stop trying to achieve some sort of magic scenario where we solve all our problems through technological innovations . 
  people who believe we can solve this by simply praising the all mighty god of science more are as deluded as the climate change deniers . 
  the only way to solve this is to ** target consumption ** . 
  that means use ** less oil , import fewer products , use less electricity , eat less meat ** and other such acts . 
  and before i hear you say ` but if we do it everyone else will just continue ' : no . 
  if one country ( e.g. 
  the germany ) lowers consumption ( e.g. 
  of easily disposable clothes ) then it impacts the economies of other countries ( e.g. 
  china , which s a huge producer of c02 ) and causes their consumption also to drop . 
  we can stop this , but it will require * radical * action . 
  there 's no need to be defeatist , but there is need for decisive action . 
  the thing is , that 's less important . 
  i think that they 're policies on immigration are fundamentally correct , but what really matters is their environmental stance . 
  what you have to do is show people why it 's important and above other concerns ( or show how most of the concerns people have around immigration like lack of housing , public transport , benefits are actually caused by other things such as privatisation and austerity rather than by migration ) . 
  if you can win those arguments you can win their votes . 
  i 'm not beyond believing people can vote rationally if you put a rational choice in front of them . 
  well , austria just elected the first green head of state , who stands for the same anti-consumerist policies i just outlined , and a poll from a few weeks ago in the uk confirmed that over 20 % of the uk population would consider voting green . 
  they may have their problematic policies , but ever increasing proportions of the electorate are starting to say that saving the planet is a worthwhile issue to spend your vote on . 
  that 's just not true .

  day 674 : they are beginning to accept me as one of their own . 
  soon they will know the truth, 
  such as ? 
  you wot ? 
  finally , someone who social sciences !, 
  this is literally the first lecture stuff in any political analysis course . 
  the polls immediately before the eu referendum were within 5 % ( which is the margin of error for such large populations ) and the trump-hilary polls were even closer ( although it 's worth noting the pollsters did correctly call the us election - hilary won by over 1,000,000 votes but the electoral college 's weird arithmetic handed it to trump ) . 
  polls have been incredibly accurate . 
  they 've just not been 100 % accurate which * no one who who knows anything about polls has ever claimed *, 
  this is the really interesting difference between the environmental movement and the neonationalist movement 's approach to globalisation . 
  both are quite sceptical of globalisation and its benefits , but neonationalists want to turn the clock back whilst environmentalists/deep ecologists want to develop globalisation to make it more sustainable and ethically sound . 
  it can cause some interesting alliances . 
  it 's impossible to change the title . 
  `` for some reason '' i think you mean because they 're the successor to the east german government . 
  the leader of die linke until a couple of years ago was literally east germany 's last prime minister . 
  east germany was heavily aligned with the ussr . 
  you can see how they may have misplaced positivity towards russia, 
  yes . 
  contacting your representative can really make a difference in how they vote . 
  here 's a list of things you can do from least effective to most effective * nothing * write a facebook comment/tweet * email them * call them * turn up in person at their office or a public meeting if you can coordinate this with other people it becomes much more effective . 
  for this particular thing , focus on your meps , but these deals are often also ratified by people at other levels of governance , so call up your mp as well , but focus on mep . 
  to be fair , that 's fairly true in the uk too . 
  london is the only city with an * extensive * underground network . 
  newcastle and glasgow also technically have underground systems , but as far as i 'm aware they both consist of a single trick ( i think newcastle 's goes in a straight line back-and-forth whilst glasgow 's goes in a circle ) . 
  so it 's not like poland 's doing especially bad . 
  even ` developed ' countries can be ridiculously biased towards the capital !, 
  sounds like fallout but in moscow so not sure ... 
  that 's really weird , especially seeing as the reichstag is literally 10 minutes walk down the the road unter den linden from berlin humboldt university ... 
  i guess they must really value their private lives . 
  `` slavonic '' is literally just the british word for `` slavic '' ( which is an american word ) . 
  see this british university 's website which refers to `` russian and ** slavonic ** studies '' . 
  if you look further on the website you can see the slavonic refers to languages like czech and polish . 
  `` slavonic language ** s ** '' as in , croatian , serbian , slovenian , bulgarian , and russian . 
  all languages which are very much alive . 
  not really sure there 'll be many possible candidates ... if you 're being put on the finance department you need to be trusted to implement the governments economic reforms & have the relevant economic expertise to implement those reforms . 
  there 's probably very few people in all of france who fulfil those two criteria ** and ** are fluent mandarin speakers . 
  just flicked to the article to see what you meant . 
  holy shit that carpet looks like an hallucination, 
  has any one else noticed that lickballz has gone quiet on all of his arguments , 
  we tend to take a lot of pride in being stoic . 
  it 's a sort of self image . 
  like that whole `` keep calm and carry on '' poster symbolises . 
  tbh i personally prefer being an emotional country , just so long as we stay behind our english speaking peers ;p, 
  so your 3/5 paragraph long rant basically comes to `` young people are too inexperienced to vote properly '' which is what i said and i said i have sympathy with it . 
  i admit to having much less experience of being a human being than most voters . 
  i 'm only sixteen and will only just be old enough to vote by the next election ( if the government remains stable that is :p ) i admit that i have yet to enter the ` real world ' . 
  however i do n't really buy into this argument of * `` life is shit so we should have a shit voting system '' * i do n't think that 's logical at all .
