  if you count up the gdp of all the nations inside the eu it would have the highest gdp in the world . 
  it 's also a huge giver of development aid . 
  eu states contribute some of the highest rates of development aid so the eu as a whole easily outstrips every other nation on that front . 
  so that 's what the eu could back it up with . 
  sanctions can do an awful lot of damage . 
  just look at iran 's currency . 
  if the asean member states all want that and they 're powerful enough as a single unit and they share enough common institutions and foreign policy , why not ? 
  there 's a very useful supporting argument to what you already said . 
  the un would be far too slow to react to anything internet related . 
  every one knows how fast things on the internet moved and most of us are aware how amazingly slow the un works . 
  i like the us keeping control at the moment because it can react to things quickly as well as being a very ( yes , it is very democratic ) democratic country which 'll listen to its people . 
  i believe it 's some thing to do with the suffix `` lands '' . 
  specifically that suffix being a plural one . 
  if you say `` england '' , it needs no `` the '' because it 's a name . 
  if you say `` netherlands '' you are referring to a group of lands ( or countries ) but it 's a specific group of lands/countries so you add a `` the '' to clarify that it 's not just any `` netherlands '' it is `` the netherlands '' . 
  yeah it 's a little silly because nothing else in the world is called nether or netherland or netherlands , but that 's english for you . 
  it 's also worth looking at why we call `` ukraine '' `` the ukraine '' . 
  it 's linguistically quite interesting . 
  it sounds more shocking that way , but i wish they 'd make it a bit more obvious which they 're talking about . 
  i always thought the opposite . 
  countries which are at the periphery of a map get affected by mercator projection and so look a lot bigger than they really are . 
  for instance , green land is not the size of europe , despite what the map shows . 
  that 's what i heard anyway, 
  it 's obvious that there 's been large scale abandonment of the intended use of the up-vote/down-vote system . 
  this is a public service announcement so that every one can be on the same page about the appropriate use of these features . 
  feel free to discuss the importance or lack there of , of the voting system or any other form of reddiquette . 
  feel free to define what `` your '' bit of europe is . 
  like you might consider your bit to be belgium or it might be the benelux or wollonia . 
  you 're still in the same place , but your area changes . 
  and i 'd love to get your opinion on whatever 's in the news as well as what you think public opinion is . 
  edit : in my defence , the number 3 and the number 4 are very close together on a keyboard . 
  edit 2 : in my defence , getting the date that badly wrong is pretty indefensible . 
  i 'll go and sit in the derp corner and think about what i 've done . 
  edit 3 : expect another one of these in two weeks time !, 
  as the title suggests . 
  state what region of europe you 're in ( can be a country like the uk or a region like bavaria ) and what the big news has been in the past week . 
  sorry i intended to make this earlier but trains and delays . 
  oh , and i can into the proper date this time ( i think ), 
  i know i said this was going to be on sunday , but i got stuck in a different city and it turns out no one was on at 11 pm british time . 
  so i figured i 'd actually make a post at a reasonable time . 
  guidlines : state your region of europe , what various groups ' opinions are , what your opinion is . 
  edit : also , do people want this with a two week interval or one week ( or other ) ? 
  ideally i 'd like it on a sunday , but the amount of time inbetween i 'm not sure . 
  you all know the drill . 
  any news from the passed week ( or even longer , if you like ) would be much appreciated here . 
  be as detailed as you want or as simple as you like . 
  you can give a whole list of stories or just one . 
  all of it is appreciated . 
  is the economy still the big news in greece ? 
  i bet it 'll die down any day now . 
  edit : does any one know how to take the blue take off of my name ? 
  i feel kind of conspicuous . . 
  guidelines : * ** please state what region of europe you are speaking from ** ( france , scotland , scandinavia , catalonia , germany , ect ) , if you have no flag or if your flag is misleading . 
  as otherwise it alienates people who do n't already know something about your region and thus means they 're continue to not know anything or spark an interest . 
  furthermore , we might assume you 're from somewhere you 're not * ** state news that has come from your region ** . 
  otherwise we generally all end up with 50 people all saying the exact same thing . 
  for instance when margaret thatcher died , if everyone had just said what they 're headline story ( ies ) were , it would have all been identical . 
  * go into as much depth as you like . 
  have fun, 
  just generally , what sort of newspapers do you have like `` the sun '' or `` the daily mail '' but in your country/language that other people may not know about . 
  this applies to online or tv things as well , like fox news in america . 
  they do n't have to be the worst , but bad enough in some way to warrant mentioning . 
  i know die bild is pretty bad , but that 's about it . 
  ** tl ; dr any tips , websites or other [ simple ] things to help people decide who to vote for in the 2014 european parliamentary elections ? 
  also , the bnp are bad . 
  ** additional information : for a lot of people voting is just too much of a hassle . 
  both in terms of actually going it in your clothes to the polling station and in terms of * deciding * who to vote for . 
  in my region , there 's a ukip and a bnp * ^ ( british national party , aka british nazi party ) * member of european parliament . 
  the main reason for this is that everyday folk do n't want to go through the effort of voting , and thus do n't . 
  this allows the really ideologically driven people to go out and vote , and those people ( at least where i live ) tend to be a bit extreme which means they 'll usually be bnp . 
  when the time 's a bit closer i 'd like to remind a few of my friends that the european elections are coming up ( nothing pushy . 
  i do n't want them to hate me . 
  just let them know it 's happening ) so as to keep the bnp ( and others ) out of office and help cut off their funding which they get from the eu by having meps . 
  here 's the thing . 
  i 'll probably send my friends an email , but i know it 's a lot of hassle to actually trawl through the huge array of candidates , parties and policies so i 'd like to know if there 's some good , preferably simple , sources of information for people to read up on those who are standing for election in 2014 . 
  there 's am emphasis on simple here so it would be much better if it was all on one website/booklet , but obviously i 'll take whatever i can get . 
  the simpler and easier it is to read through , the greater the likelyhood people actually reading it and thus voting , thus , keeping the bnp out . 
  similar to how has been done with the `` what do you know about ... '' threads . 
  linguists and language learners would find it very beneficial, 
  / u/stuck _ in_the_matrix in / r/theoryofreddit has made a piece of code which will check what other sub-reddits subscribers of a specific sub-reddit have made a certain number of comments in over the past five days .

  there seems to be an implicit agreement that the crimea should be part of ukraine like it is currently and has been since 1954 . 
  however , should it ? 
  * it 's only been part of ukraine for a relatively meagre 60 years and there 's plenty of people who will remember when it was part of russia ( even if that was in soviet times ) . 
  ( historic/conservative arguments are void ) * the ukrainian language is a minority language there , and ukrainians are a minority ethnicity there . 
  ( culturally distinct ) * the * elected * regional government has made moves to separate crimea from the rest of ukraine . 
  ( democratic legitimacy ) it really seems the crimeans have an identity which is very distinct from the rest of ukraine and , if we believe in self-determination , we ought to let crimea make its own way in the world , if it wants to do that . 
  many cities have a sort of inexplicable aura attached to their name . 
  think of paris , saint peter 's burg , london , vienna , rome , athens . 
  they all have this aura attached to their name which singles them out as culturally significant . 
  prague is definitely among these ( it got mentioned by churchill in his iron curtain speech as one of the great cities of europe that is ` now cut off from , isolated behind the curtain ' ) i know all sorts of things about these cities which i can use to explain why they sound like this to me , however i do n't actually know anything about prague . 
  i 'm sure other people feel similar . 
  so , with the interests of becoming more educated about europe and european history in mind , why is prague significant ?
