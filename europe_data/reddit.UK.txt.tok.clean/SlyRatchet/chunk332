  we 've had to remove far too many important and often breaking news stories because the titles look nothing like the ones on the site it links to . 
  this is not just a sub rule , it is part of the site-wide reddiquette ( which you can find linked in the sidebar and at the bottom of every page on reddit ) . 
  here are the rules 1 . 
  racism , as well as xenophobia , homophobia and other forms of bigotry will not be tolerated . 
  personal attacks that add nothing to the conversation will be removed . 
  infographics which are poorly sourced will be removed . 
  the submitter must provide the source in the comments , including a brief explanation if necessary , soon after making the submission . 
  image macros and memes will be removed . 
  please do not spam the subreddit , this includes engaging in a campaign to promote a website , whether your own or someone else 's , and attempting to use the subreddit as a platform for narrow political activism , especially on a contentious issue . 
  in particular , if this involves an attempt to band-wagon the forum , by calling for support from other subreddits or websites . 
  this is a moderated forum , to maintain a civil environment , and a high level of debate . 
  we reserve the right to actively moderate the subreddit as is reasonable , to achieve those aims . 
  in order to maintain a high level of discussion and debate , without regression to easily understandable ` jokes ' which add little to the conversation , comments which consist exclusively or largely of gifs or images shall be removed . 
  there 's also two community guidelines , 1 . we request that users who post non-english articles also post a translation ( even if just a machine translation ) to help the forum engage with the post . 
  however , this is only a request , and posts will not be removed for this reason . 
  2 . please use the upvote/downvote to mark interesting content , rather than agreement/disagreement . 
  we encourage engaging civil criticism instead of downvoting an unpopular opinion . 
  most users most of them time stick to these fine , but it seems that given a rise in the number of people making increasingly large numbers of minor infringements ( especially editorialising and rule 7 ) and that the new year is nearly upon us , we should all just take a couple of moments to familiarise ourself with any changes that might of happened to them since you last read them . 
  doing some research on authoritarianism in iberia , but there 's not a lot of good sources out there which i 've been able to find . 
  do you know any ? 
  i know , i know . 
  this is literally more exciting than the ukraine crisis and charlie hedbo rolled into one !, 
  / r/europe has a nice new shiny set of rules !, 
  just a quick pre-amble to explain why we think this was necessary . 
  we 've had virtually the same set of rules since , well , virtually forever and the sub has groan a huge amount since then . 
  the way we moderate this subreddit has changed to adapt to the new challenges of dealing with almost three hunred thousand readers . 
  as a subreddit gets larger , the chances of it degrading into an / r/adviceanimals-esc mess increase , which is why the need for a more involved mod team increases with size . 
  many of you will have noticed the crackdown on unsourced images recently , which is part of this . 
  we 've also not been very transparent in our modding here . 
  we 've not kept you very onboard with the changes to modding policies . 
  that 's a large reason for updating the rules in the sidebar . 
  we thnk that all users will enjoy themselves more if they are more aware of what is going on behind the scenes , and so hopefully this is a sign that we are very willing to do that . 
  so without further \u00e0 deux , here they are . 
   *** bannable ***  1.1 ** bigotry , hate speech and xenophobia ** of any form ( sexism , racism , homophobia , islamophobia , russophobia , anti-semitism , et al ) are not tolerated here . 
  to provide further clarity , we here is a small list of examples . 
  please use your common sense to interpret this rule . 
   * it is ok to criticise immigration . 
   * it is ok to criticise members of minority groups . 
   * it is not ok to suggest that members of different cultures or races are incapable of cohabiting . 
   * it is not ok to suggest that some races or cultures are inherently better than others . 
   * it is not ok to make pejorative statements about large cultural , national or ethnic groups ** especially when ** these groups are not entered into by choice ( e.g. 
  race , gender , sexuality ) . 
   * additionally , ** holocaust denial ** ( of either the 1915 armenian genocide or the 1941-5 holocaust of the jews , homosexuals , the disabled , jehovah 's witnesses , etc. ), 
  is completely ** un ** acceptable . 
   1.2 ** personal attacks ** that do not add any substance to a conversation will be de-listed [ removed ] . 
  if this continues a ban may be placed . 
   1.3 ** spamming ** is not tolerated here . 
  spam will be removed . 
  if spamming continues despite warnings from moderators , a ban will be given . 
  this applies for spamming of charitable causes too , but please message the mod team about this [ write ' / r/europe ' in the recipient field ] if you have a charitable cause you would like to post about . 
   1.4 we reserve the right to remove any ** bot ** accounts . 
   1.5 ** circumventing a previous ban ** is not allowed . 
  keep this in mind concerning \u00a7 4.2  *** removable ***  2.1 ** info-graphics , images , selfs posts ** and other similar content which makes ( an ) assertion ( s ) but lacks ( a ) source ( s ) will be removed . 
  the original submitter [ op ] should post the source ( if it is not cited in the submission itself ) as soon as possible . 
  if the op receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [ removed ] due to lack of source , they may * still * provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [ unremoved ] . 
  but moderators frequently require hours to respond to such messages . 
   2.2 ** reaction gifs and memes ** are not allowed here . 
   2.3 ** editorialising ** is not acceptable . 
  editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a ( submission ) title . 
  you should , in most cases , use the title on the page you are linking to . 
  however , in the case of youtube , you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an * unpartisan * and * neutral * title if the one the youtube video uses is clearly partisan and bias . 
   2.4 ** unreliable domains ** including but not limited to , blogspot , tumblr , facebook and wordpress will be removed . 
   2.5 mods reserve the right to remove egregiously ** low quality content ** under limited circumstances  2.6 ** content which does not fit with the theme of this subreddit ** and/or is not relevant here shall be removed ( e.g. 
  domestic us politics or economics in argentina )  *** community guidelines ***  3.1 we request that users who post ** non-english articles ** also post a translation ( even if just a machine translation ) to help the forum engage with the post . 
  however , this is only a request , and posts will not be removed for this reason . 
   3.2 please use the ** upvote/downvote ** to mark interesting content , rather than agreement/disagreement . 
  we encourage engaging civil criticism instead of downvoting an unpopular opinion . 
   3.3 please report users that you ** suspect of breaking our rules ** or the reddiquette by using the report button visible bellow each comment or submission and state the rule number which is being broken . 
   *** side notes ***  4.1 this is a moderated forum , to maintain a civil environment , and a high level of debate we reserve the right to actively moderate the subreddit as is reasonable to achieve those aims . 
   4.2 if you have been banned once you are may appeal after one week . 
  keep this in mind regarding rule 1.5  4.3 if a * delisted * [ removed ] thread is still gathering unwanted attention ( especially as a bigoted/xenophobic circle jerk ) it will be `` nuked '' which has the effect of locking the thread down completely . 
   4.4 the reddiquette is part of this subreddit and we will moderate according to it . 
  if you break reddiquette you are effectively breaking our subreddit rules too . 
  if you have not yet read the reddiquette , please read it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/ ) we thank you for your co-operation and look forward to improving this subreddit on all of your behalves . 
  welcome to the / r/europe uk 2015 general election mega thread . 
  -- what 's happening ? 
  a new uk government is going to be voted on today . 
  the voting system being used is first past the post . 
  there are 650 constituents , each electing a single member of parliament . 
  in order to reach an * effective * majority , the parties need 323 , because one party ( sinn fein ) refuse to tape up their seats in parliament , and the speaker and the deputy speaker do n't vote on legislation . 
  -- when are we gon na know who 's `` won '' ? 
  the first constituency which is likely to call its result is sunderland a couple of hours after polls close ( polls closed at 10pm gmt ) . 
  but sunderland is the exception and most of the seats will be announced at 4pm gmt , including most of the big important seats such as david cameron 's , ed miliband 's and most importantly nick clegg 's ( the deputy prime minister and leader of the liberal democrats who may lose his seat ) . 
  some polling stations are n't starting to count until tomorrow morning , and with an election this close * every * seat matters . 
  so we 'll know where all the cards stand at approximately lunch time on friday . 
  this will be followed by coalition negotiations . 
  -- polls : | parties | total votes [ predicted ] | total votes [ confirmed ] | seats [ predicted ] | seats [ confirmed ] | | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | | conservative | 34 % | | 325 | 248 | | labour | 33 % | | 225 | 213 | | liberal democrats | 9 % | | 12 | 6 | | uk independence party | 13 % | | 2 | 1 | | greens | 5 % | | 1 | 0 | | scottish nationalist party | n/a | | 55 | 55 | | other | 7 % | | 22 ( +1 ) | | [ source for votes ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/poll-tracker ) [ source for seat predictions ] ( http://www.may2015.com/category/seat-calculator/ ) -- *** updates *** [ first exit polls out ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82841000/png/_82841623_live.png ) -- live updates : [ bbc ( live blog ) ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/election-2015-32594267 ) [ bbc ( tv ) ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/live/bbcone ) [ reddit live thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/live/uv8ij5qbz3ps ) -- who are the major parties and what are their policies at a glance ** conservatives ** : the uk 's oldest surviging political party . 
  notable figures including winston churchil , margaret thatcher and the current prime minister david cameron . 
  the conservatives ( sometimes known as tories ) have pledged a binding `` in/out '' referendum on the european union in 2017 if they are elected with a majority in parliament . 
  they are also are one of the most heavily in favour of austerity , tax cuts and against government borrowing . 
  the conservative party sits with the [ european conservatives and reformists party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_conservatives_and_reformists ) in the european parliament . 
  preior to 2008 , the british conservative party sat with the [ european people 's party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party ) , which is shared by the french ump ( sarkozy 's party ) , german cdu ( merkel 's party ) and european commission president jean-claude juncker . 
  they left because the epp was too pro-european in their view . 
  possible ** coalition partners ** : liberal democrats , ukip , ulster unionists party . 
  ** labour ** : has been one of the uk 's two main political parties ever since the second world war . 
  notable figures include clement attlee and tony blaire . 
  the current leader is ed miliband . 
  the labour party is against a european referendum and is one of the most pro-europe nationwide parties in the uk . 
  they are campaigning on a platform of reduced cuts and increased government borrowing . 
  they have also pledged to cap price rises on energy bills and rail .
