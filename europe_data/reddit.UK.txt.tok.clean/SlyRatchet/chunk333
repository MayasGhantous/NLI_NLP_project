  commentators have drawn comparisons between ed miliband 's view of britain and modern day germany . 
  the labour party sits with the [ progressive alliance of socialists and democrats ( s&d ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progressive_alliance_of_socialists_and_democrats ) in the european parliament , which is shared by the german social democrats , the french socialist party ( hollande 's party ) and martin schulz ( european parliament president ) . 
  possible ** coalition partners ** : liberal democrats , scottish nationalists , irish social democrats , plaid cymru and the greens . 
  ** liberal democrats ** : the lib dems were created in 1988 by a merger of the uk 's liberal party and the social democratic party . 
  notable figures include wwi british prime minister david lloyd george and modern deputy prime minister nick clegg . 
  nick clegg is the party 's current leader , although he is in danger of losing his seat in sheffield hallam today and therfore losing his leadership of the party . 
  the liberal democrats had not been part of a uk government since the party was created , until 2010 , where they coalitioned with the conservative party . 
  this led to them retracted many of their party 's pledges , most notably pledging to abolish tuition fees , which has tainted the party 's image ever since . 
  they are the uk 's most pro-european party and campaigned on adopting the euro and ditching the pound as late as the 2005 general election . 
  their econmic policies have been described as ` cut less than the conservatives , but borrow less than labour '' . 
  they sit with the [ alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ( alde ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe ) in the european parliament , whose leader is guy verhofstadt . 
  ** ukip ** : the united kingdom indepdence party has shocked the political establishment by going from 3 % of the national vote share in the 2010 election , to a predicted 13 % share in 2015 . 
  their leader is nigel farage . 
  they have pledged that if they are part of a coalition they would demand an in/out referendum on britain 's eu membership be held as soon as possible . 
  they 've pledged more austerity than the conservatives , but would protected the armed forces from cuts . 
  they sit with [ europe of freedom and direct democract ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_of_freedom_and_direct_democracy ) in the european parliament , along with the italian five star movement and the sweden democrats . 
  ukip has claimed they would coalition with either the conservatives or labour if either agrees to a binding referendum . 
  ** greens ** : the green party of england and wales has the typical development of a european green party , becoming a formal political party in the late 1980s . 
  the current leader is natalie bennet ( an australian ) , and the party has one mp ( caroline lucas ) . 
  the party is popular amongst young and first time voters , but is increasingly winning votes from long time members of the labour , who believe the labour party has become too right wing . 
  the party 's core policies are a 60 % top rate of tax ( as opposed to the current 45 % rate ) , an end to austerity and phasing out all coal and nuclear power stations by 2023 . 
  the party also supports a referendum on the eu , despite being pro-eu ( an unusual combination in british politics ) . 
  the party sits with the [ greens european free alliance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_greens%e2%80%93european_free_alliance ) in the european parliament , along with two other uk parties , the scottish nationalists and plaid cymru ( the party of wales ) . 
  most green parties from across europe sit with the gefa , as do the belgian and german pirate parties . 
  ** scottish national party ** : the rise of the scottish nationalists in scotland has been faster and larger than even the ongoing rise of ukip . 
  the party has led a majority government in the scottish parliament since 2011 . 
  since the referendum on scottish independence , many scottish voters who were concerned about voting snp because they did n't want to break up the united kingdom , now feel safe in voting for the snp which has led to the party being predicted to win half of all votes cast in scotland . 
  the party is campaigning on an end to austerity . 
  the snp as well as the scottish generally are seen as being more favourably to the eu than the uk at large . 
  nicola sturgeon , snp leader , has claimed that any referendum on leaving the eu must reach a majority in all four uk constituent countries ( england , scotland , wales and northern ireland ) . 
  the snp sits with sit the green european free alliance in the european parliament , mentioned above in the paragraph on the green party . 
  the semi-finals of eurovision start today . 
  on saturday is the finale we 've been waiting all year for , but if you 're just ca n't wait until then to discuss all of these grand songs in all of their glory , then here 's your place . 
  [ link to live stream here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyucr-sfenc ) and do n't forget that / r/europe has it 's own live irc channel which operates all the time and is currently in eurovision frenzy . 
  [ click here ] ( https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/europe/?settings=dd892af474749b032ba39bb88a8894d9 ) edit : qualifiers are as follows : albania armenia russia romania hungary greece estonia georgia serbia belgium, 
  the best write up on what happened can be found [ here ] ( http://redd.it/3bxduw ) , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/modclub/comments/3bypwq/rmodclub_amageddon_discussion_thread/csqrsaj ) , [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/3byxtg/regarding_todays_reddit_drama/ ) and in many other parts of reddit . 
  we 're not a default or anywhere near the size of giants like / r/iama , we do n't do that many ama 's and the loss of victoria taylor aka / u/chooter did not have any particular impact on this sub . 
  but the larger issues do . 
  for some time now there has been a growing feeling that reddit and its employees have become completely disconnected from the community as a whole , and that there is a growing amount of corporatisation of the site . 
  while reddit pursues ( and abandons ) projects such as redditmade , redditnotes , statements of core values , and somewhat inconsistent policies of removing subreddits on dubious ground and similar , moderators are having to deal with a set of mod tools that are woefully outdated ( and require multiple 3rd party extensions/hacks just to be semi-functional ) , lack of communication on upcoming changes we 'll have to deal with , and in many cases a complete lack of response from the admins on issues only the admins can solve . 
  so , we took the decision to join the protest against the current reddit by making the sub private for a day . 
  long enough to make a point , but not long enough to piss too many users off . 
  we did this because the many of the moderators here and other moderators across reddit are really not happy with the direction the site as a whole is taking , but the admins can not see this precisely because they do not communicate with us . 
  we 're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused our users , but we believe it is more than justified simply because it provided an opportunity to get the admins attention and improve our ability to support the communities we care so much about . 
  we look forward to providing coverage and discussion of the greek referendum and aftermath in the coming days , as well as many other european issues . 
  during the grisis and the greferendum many users of / r/europe came out to say that you 'd like us to try and get an ask me anything ( ama ) with [ former ] greek finance minister yanis varoufakis . 
  we have n't been quite so fortunate ( he is a somewhat big fish , after all ) , but it has motivated us and encouraged us to try and actually get prominent europeans to come to our subreddit and to talk with the community here . 
  this is what i 've been doing over the summer through email and i 'm thrilled to say that i can finally announce what i hope will be the first of many amas in / r/europe , starting with richard corbett , a [ member of the european parliament ( mep ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_of_the_european_parliament ) . 
  he 's one of two yorkshire labour party meps , which is part of the [ s&d bloc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progressive_alliance_of_socialists_and_democrats ) , and is the deputy leader of the labour party meps . 
  he 's also a member of the committee on constitutional affairs and the fisheries committee . 
  you can read more about him at [ his website ] ( http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/about-me/ ) and obviously [ twit at him ] ( https://twitter.com/rcorbettmep?ref_src=twsrc%5egoogle%7ctwcamp%5eserp%7ctwgr%5eauthor ) if you 're into that sort of thing . 
  we 're also in discussions with two other meps about doing an ama , but i 'd love it if we got more . 
  if you have any suggestions for europeans , be they politicians , celebrities , academics or ordinary folks or something else that you 'd like to do an ama with / r/europe then please , send us a pm or comment here or get in touch somehow and we 'll try to make it happen . 
  so get some good questions ready for the 21st of october , but one final word of caution : treat our ama guests with respect . 
  we want to do more amas in the future , after all . 
  let 's make them feel as positive about us as they want us to feel positive about them . 
  it may have come to your attention that / r/europe is somewhat understaffed considering it 's one of the 100 largest subreddits . 
  with that in mind , we 'd like to expand our team to include a wider variety of moderators in terms of their skills , backgrounds , locations and opinions . 
  this thread shall remain open for one week , starting from today and ending on tuesday 8th of september . 
  on 8th of september we will no longer be accepting new applications , but all applications will remain visible for an additional week until tuesday 15th of september . 
  the purpose of this extra week is for the community to provide feedback on the applicants , and also to ask the applicants any further questions they think are relevant . 
  we obviously encourage the applicants to answer as many of these as they can . 
  if you 'd like to raise an issue with/about an applicant , then please do so in a level headed and respectful way . 
  being rude , aggressive , or otherwise disregarding reddiquette will only damage your case . 
  after the 15th of september we will shortly be announcing the new mods . 
  additionally , given our experiences in the recent past , we will not be giving the new mods full permissions straight away . 
  instead , they will be phased in over time according to each new mods individual ability . 
  with all that in mind , we 'd love to see a whole range of applications . 
  if you think you have anything to offer as a moderator , then we encourage you to apply here !, 
  -- please answer these questions . 
  and remember , we 're judging based on the quality of the answers , not on their length . 
  * how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  * how often do you visit / r/europe ?

  explain why good luck !, 
  just a reminder that we 're having an ama with richard corbett mep tomorrow !, 
  if you 've got any questions about the european parliament , any european issues ( ttip , migration crisis , ukraine crisis , eurozone crisis , etc ) then this is an excellent opportunity to ask someone who works with these issues every day . 
  the post will go live from around nine o'clock ( so you can ask questions from then ) but he 'll be answering questions from around 16:00 till 19:00 central european time . 
   ** please remember ** during the ama to treat our guests like just that , a guest . 
  we 're honoured that they 've agreed to come here in front of a huge crowd , a crowd masked by anonymity no less , and they 'll be open to answering any question . 
  that 's something that we should respect and encourage by treating them with respect . 
  you can ask hard questions , but be polite about them . 
  otherwise , the moderators will have to step on , which we really do n't want to do . 
  that 's this monday coming , so get your questions ready !, 
  he 'll be answering questions from 15:00 uk time onwards . 
  twitter : @clrandrewcooper ( and he does use twitter ) website : www.greeningkirklees.blogspot.co.uk -- and do n't forget to give me a message if you 've heard of anybody who even has the slightest possibility of doing an ama . 
  i 'm already chasing up a couple of leads from last time that users pm 'd in , so do n't be shy !,
