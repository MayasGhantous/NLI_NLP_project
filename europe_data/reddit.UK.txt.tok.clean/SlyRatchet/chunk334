  we 're happy to announce that mep catherine bearder will be doing an ama here on / r/europe on the 4th of december !, 
  get your questions ready !, 
  here 's just a little bit of information about the work catherine bearder is doing . 
  -- * [ catherine ] ( http://www.bearder.eu/ ) is the [ liberal democrat ] ( http://www.libdems.org.uk/ ) member of the european parliament for the south east of england and belongs to the liberal group ( [ alde ] ( http://www.alde.eu/ ) ) which has 70 meps from 20 countries . 
  * * as * *** chair of the liberal democrat [ eu referendum campaign ] ( http://www.libdems.org.uk/europe ) *** , * catherine will be playing a key role in the fight to keep britain in the eu . 
  she believes passionately that being in eu makes britain stronger and better able to respond to common challenges like climate change and organised crime , as well as giving people the opportunity to live , work and study all around europe . 
  * * catherine is pushing for a humane and common european response to the * *** refugee crisis *** , * after having [ met with refugees ] ( http://www.bearder.eu/euro_mp_urges_government_to_take_responsibility_for_refugee_crisis_after_seeing_situation_first_hand_in_calais ) firsthand at the camps in calais . 
  she is calling on the uk government to opt in to the * *** eu 's relocation scheme *** * to resettle refugees already in europe and to step up diplomatic efforts to tackle the root causes of the crisis in countries like syria and eritrea . 
  * * air pollution causes 400,000 premature deaths in the eu each year . 
  catherine has been leading negotiations over creating ambitious * *** [ eu air quality targets ] ( http://www.bearder.eu/meps_vote_for_ambitious_eu_air_pollution_limits_including_ammonia_and_methane ) *** * that could have this number , and has has also spoken out against the handling of the * *** volkswagen scandal *** * and the failure of eu national governments to reduce deadly pollution from diesel cars . 
  * * last year catherine established meps 4 wildlife - a cross-party group of meps pushing for an * *** eu action plan to stamp out poaching *** * and the illegal wildlife trade . 
  wildlife trafficking is the fourth biggest illegal trade in the world and is pushing species such as elephants and rhinos to the brink of extinction . 
  catherine wants the eu to step up the fight against this vile trade though tougher sanctions for wildlife traffickers and closer cooperation between police and customs officials around europe . 
  * * catherine will soon be drafting a report on [ human trafficking ] ( http://www.bearder.eu/end_human_trafficking ) as part of her work on the * *** women 's rights committee *** . 
  * there were over 30,000 victims of human trafficking in the eu from 2010-2012 , [ 80 % of whom were women ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20141203sto82703/html/human-trafficking-80-of-victims-in-the-eu-are-women-and-girls ) . 
  catherine will be looking into the implementation of the eu 's anti-trafficking law , which ensures that trafficked people are treated as victims , not as illegal immigrants , and are given the support they need . 
  catherine is active on [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/catherinemep ) and [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/catherinebeardermep/ ) . 
  * -- look forward to seeing you all there in a few weeks ' time !, 
  and remember , if you 've got any other recommendations for future amas , then do n't be afraid to send us a quick message !,

  welcome to the / r/europe megathread for the spanish elections , which will be taking place throughout today . 
  please use this thread to discuss any and everything about spain and its elections , especially stuff that has n't fitted in an ordinary thread so far . 
  it can be as specific or as broad as you like . 
  these threads will get refreshed every six , to twenty four hours depending on the amount of content . 
  [ previous thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xgc3u/spain_votes_tomorrow_to_elect_a_new_parliament/ ) -- ## ** what are the basics ? 
  ** ** what 's the voting system ? 
  ** spain uses , essentially , the same system as in the european parliamentary elections : list proportional representation with the d'hont method , where spain 's various provinces act as the constituencies ( catalonia , basque country , madrid , galicia and so on ) . 
  sparsely populated areas have slightly more members per capita than more densely populated provinces . 
  the threshold for representation is 3 % . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_spain#electoral_process ) ** how long till the polls close and when do we know the result ? 
  ** most polls are open from ** 9:00 cet ( gmt plus 1 ) till 20:00 cet ** ( that 's why we 're posting this thread so early ) on sunday , 20th of december . 
  the vote count will likely start at 21:00 cet . 
  however , the definitive result will not be known until wednesday the 23rd , which is when postal votes are counted . 
  this is when we will know the result definitively . 
  however , the new government will not convene until mid january . 
  the current government , led by partido popular pm rajoy will continue in a caretaker capacity until then .

  -- ## ** predictions ** ## two parties ( pp and psoe ) have dominated spanish politics since the early 1980s and have alternated in government . 
  that seems likely to change tomorrow , with the rise of two newly-formed parties : podemos and ciudadanos . 
  first of all , here 's the latest poll ( published in andorra as opinion polls are not allowed to be published in spain during the week leading up to the election ) : [ poll ] ( http://sondeos.elperiodic.ad/quinto-sondeo.html ) . 
  [ image ] ( http://sondeos.elperiodic.ad/cinque-estimacio2.jpg ) -- ## ** who 's standing for elections and what do ** *** they *** ** stand for ? 
  ** ** partido popular ** ( people 's party ) : conservative , centre-right to right-wing . 
  euro group : european people 's party  the party in government of prime minister mariano rajoy will likely be again the most voted party in tomorrow 's election , but is expected to suffer huge losses ( from 44 % of the vote in 2011 to between 25 % and 30 % this year according to the polls ) . 
  ** psoe - partido socialista obrero espa\u00f1ol ** ( socialist workers ' party of spain ) : social-democratic , centre-left . 
  euro group : socialists and democrats/pan european socialist party  pedro s\u00e1nchez is the new leader of the socialists , who fight to stay relevant and avoid being overtaken by podemos from the left and ciudadanos from the right . 
  ** podemos ** ( we can ) : democratic-socialist , left-wing . 
  euro group : european united left/nordic green alliance  political science professor pablo iglesias has moderated his tone and his proposals in an attempt to win votes from the moderate left and have a chance of becoming prime minister . 
   their calls for social reform and their opposition to austerity measures have resonated with the struggling working-class , but the other parties have warned of a syriza style catastrophe . 
   podemos is the only major party in spain that supports a referendum on catalan sovereignty . 
  ** ciudadanos ** ( citizens ) : liberal , centre . 
  euro group : uncertain  can a 36-year-old called albert , rather than alberto , become the next prime minister of spain ? 
  barcelona-born albert rivera 's poor showings in the debates , coupled with pablo iglesias ' strong performances , have meant ciudadanos has plummetted in the polls and is now a distant fourth . 
   a liberal party in the european sense with a strong unionist stance , ciudadanos appeals to the urban middle-class but struggles to set a foothold in decisive rural areas . 
   rivera stated on friday he would abstain if his party is not the most voted party . 
  many people have interpreted this as meaning they would tacitly support a rajoy re-appointment as prime minister . 
  other parties : ** izquierda unida ** ( united left ) : democratic-socialist , left-wing to far-left . 
  euro group : european united left/nordic green alliance  the historical party of the democratic-socialist left stems from the communist party of spain , and has seen its very existence threatened by the rise of podemos . 
  while their leader alberto garz\u00f3n is charismatic and popular , they 're unlikely to get more than 4-7 seats . 
  ** democr\u00e0cia i llibertat ** ( democracy and freedom , in catalan ) : conservative catalan nationalists . 
   after the catalan elections in september , catalan president artus mas is fighting to get the votes he needs from the far-left pro-independence party cup to get re-elected as president , and thus to push forward his plan to create an independent catalan republic . 
  meanwhile , his party , with the seats it gets from the four catalan provinces , could be decisive in the formation of a new spanish government . 
  ** esquerra republicana de catalunya ** ( republican left of catalonia , in catalan ) : left-wing catalan nationalists . 
   erc united forces with mas to push for catalan independence . 
  they could also be decisive . 
  partido nacionalista vasco ( basque nationalist party ) : conservative basque nationalists . 
  unlike their catalan counterparts , the pnv is not overtly pro-independence . 
  like them , however , their few seats could prove crucial . 
  other regional nationalist parties : amaiur ( basque left-wing nationalists ) , bng ( galician nationalists ) , cc ( canarian regionalists-nationalists ) . 
  -- ## ** possible outcomes ** ## if pp and ciudadanos achieve an absolute majority ( boring option ) : scenario 1 : rajoy will be prime minister with the votes of pp and abstention of ciudadanos . 
  edit : i should have made this clearer : this pressuposes of course that pp garners more mps than the rest of the parties minus ciudadanos . 
  if pp and ciudadanos do not achieve an absolute majority ( interesting option ) : the non-ciudadanos opposition will vote unanimously against rajoy and he will not be able to get enough votes to be appointed prime minister only with his party 's votes . 
  so what next ? 
  scenario 2 : psoe and podemos reach an absolute majority combined , either s\u00e1nchez or iglesias is appointed prime minister in a coalition government or a minority government with parliament support . 
  scenario 3 : psoe and podemos fail to reach an absolute majority , but manage to get s\u00e1nchez or iglesias appointed as prime minister with the votes in favour or ( more likely ) the abstention of minor nationalist parties . 
  scenario 4 : pp and psoe form a grand coalition german style , rajoy is appointed prime minister . 
  unlikely judging by the statements both parties have offered these days . 
  scenario 5 : huge mess . 
  talks fail and no government is formed . 
  the king calls for new elections .
