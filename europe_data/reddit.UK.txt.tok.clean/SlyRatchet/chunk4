  living standards actually dropped in a lot of european countries due to this dependence and because we remained for so long unable to harness economic forces to rebuild , because all those funds were being syphoned off back to america . 
  the british actually had to ration bread in 1947 , which we had n't even had to do during war time . 
  and america took on a * huge * reserve of british pound sterling , which , whenever britain behaved in a non-compliant manner , it would sell on a huge scale , causing the value of the pound to drop , like happened during the suez canal crisis . 
  so forgive me for not waving many american flags about lend-lease or the marshall plan . 
  sure , an injection of money looks like it helps , and it certainly helped in the very , very short term . 
  but in the long term it was an ingenious bit of american foreign policy , because europe has remained subservient ever since and has taken every opportunity to further this achievement [ e.g. 
  [ nuclear development ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manhattan_project#collaboration_with_the_united_kingdom ) ] . 
  it even says that we should participate more in the eu !, 
   ^ ( so let 's stop copying them . 
  let 's stop fawning over them and following them in their fools ' errands around the globe . 
  let 's focus on what we 're good at and aim to be a great , mid-sized liberal country . 
  we do many things well , so lets do them better . 
  let 's copy the good bits of places like sweden and germany , let 's play a full role in europe -- and make europe more british rather than making ourselves more american . 
  the germans and the french would love us to engage properly in the eu , rather than insisting on our role as some imaginary bridge . 
  and , above all , let 's stop trying to dress in the clothes of a country five sizes too big for us . ), 
  i think the telegraph might have been hacked . 
  if you 'd 've actually read the article , you 'd know that the author acknowledges that and makes several of the points you just made . 
   if this sounds like i 'm anti-american , i 'm not . 
  i love many things about america and i 'd quite like to live in new york or san francisco for a few years . 
  but loving america is not the same as being america 's sycophantic yes-man . 
  so , strangely , i have a problem with the way we suck up to the us , not with the way america treats us . 
  it 's exactly what we 'd do in their position . 
  as you can see . 
  it 's not anti-american tripe . 
  it 's pointing out that the british ( and especially their politicians ) have a view of their relationship with america which simply does n't exist , and that we should acknowledge that and create a proper foreign policy relationship , where we * both * know our place . 
  could you gi ' us an example ? 
  can confirm ; love canada . 
  gib clay plz, 
  for the regions of europe one , it might be easier to have a separate thread where people draw it and submit them as comments . 
  we had that a few years ago and it was a lot of fun . 
  and regarding the russian geopolitics one , we should widen that and include a few other aspects like feelings towards america and its military presence in europe , islamic state * et al * in the middle east and maybe the instability and immigration from our north african neighbours . 
  we could ask that sort of question twice , one time regarding the number of eu member states , and another for the level of integration between eu states, 
  i think he means link to / r/europe from the site , rather than posting a link to your site in / r/europe, 
  personally i would n't get * too * bogged down in the european council/european parliament/european commission/european court of justice distinctions and how it all works day to day . 
  just focus on explaining the bits which are relevant for dispelling the myths and eurosceptic arguments . 
  for instance people talk about the eu being undemocratic , but actually there 's the european parliament ( which is directly elected by the people ) which needs to agree to * every * piece of legislation . 
  there 's the council of the european union which is made up of the directly elected heads of government of the eu states . 
  and then there 's the european commission which is recommended by the european council ( directly elected ) and then approved by the european parliament ( directly elected ) . 
  when you keep all this in mind , it actually seems just as democratic as any of the member states themselves . 
  furthermore , when you keep in mind that any change in the treaties ( the constitution ) requires * consensus * ( every single member state agreeing ) it looks very democratic . 
  additionally , most decisions taken by the council of the european union are done using ` ordinary legislative procedures ' which require both a super majority ^ ( ^ ( super majority is a majority [ 50 % +1 ] and then a whole load more percentage points . 
  usually 66.7 % or 75 % ) ) of the eu member states and a super majority of eu population . 
  so it 's actually very democratic . 
  and that is one of the things which should be pointed out on a website like this . 
  in as simple terms and language as is possible . 
  but do n't try and explain the entire eu . 
  there are scholars who have devoted years to trying to do that . 
  it 's actually not that bad of an idea . 
  it is deploying a similar idea to these two sites http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/ http://whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/ which were both inspired by this scene from monty python 's * the life of brian * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exwfh6sgyso the point is , it 's a positive message disguised as a negative one . 
  i guess , but this is n't really a place to make your english that of a native and high level business executive . 
  it would just lead to clutter on the sight and a lot of arguments about grammar which detract from real discussion about things , like the passport in the op . 
  but the thing is , i do n't think it 's incorrect . 
  i think this is one of those bits of grammar which really does n't matter . 
  i 've used this sentence construction before and continue to do so , and i 'm a native speaker . 
  i would n't correct someone over it . 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  how does a passport cover ( even a very nice one ) end up costing that much ? 
  even the british one costs [ 30 quid ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/munkets-eu-european-union-passport/dp/b00hx192j4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1413475400&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=european+union+passport++cover ) and on amazon.de it 's [ $ 40 ] ( http://www.amazon.de/munkets-eu-europ\u00e4ische-reisepass-brieftasche/dp/b00hx192j4/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1413475131&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=eurpaische+reisepass+cover ) . 
  do keep in mind that you 're not seeing a particularly representative sample of any of the aforementioned groups . 
  treat users as suers , not just whatever flag they happen to have near their name . 
  a ) and some uk tories are hugely pro-eu ( e.g. 
  dominic grieve , clarke ) some quite.eurosceptic ( boris johnson ) . 
  some tories are very.isolationist , some are n't . 
  you have a lot of variety within these groups , but there 's also a lot of common ground . 
  there 's a reason the most of them all sat together in the european people 's party in the european parliament for so long . 
  b ) the reason no power has been shifted back to a member state from brussels based on the subsidiarity principle , is because the eu is never given a power that it should n't have in the first place . 
  every single power the eu is given is very.carefully deliberated . 
  i think the fact no power has ever been returned is a sign of how well executed the principle of subsidiarity has been executed, 
  i do n't think the author made any convincing argument for federalism in that entire piece . 
  he just repeatedly said that we need it . 
  not very convincing . 
  then at the end , he just says it would be an asymmetric , ` hold it together ' type anyway , which is basically the same thing we really have , further obscuring the benefits of change . 
  then there 's a random comment about house of lords reform which is n't really articulated upon . 
  so i feel pretty unconvinced . 
  the uk has such a wide variety of nations who all have such a varying amounts of individuality and size that trying to impose a ` clean ' ` neat ' federation system from above will just not work because any thing so clean cut will not be able to take into account all of the differences . 
  additionally it will not be a let to.incorporate changes in nationality at the rapid speeds we currently do . 
  we should keep the uk constitution flexible at this point , and keep it lose . 
  nothing good will come out of some crazy scheme to clean up all the uk 's constitutional problems in one go . 
  yeah , but these days that 's also somewhat true of dublin and paris for the uk . 
  i mean , if dublin suddenly becomes world capital of commerce it 'll still help out the uk economy generally because of trade and economic links and even some common eu expeniture ( uk esa funding and eu aid for economically deprived regions [ cornwall ] are good examples ) . 
  london having an economic boon probably does help slightly more than dublin having one , but they 're both pretty distant . 
  a ) positive punishment does work . 
  b ) it does happen http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cruelty_to_animals#circuses  the use of animals in the circus has been controversial since animal welfare groups have ** documented instances of animal cruelty during the training of performing animals ** . 
  the humane society of the united states has documented multiple cases of abuse and neglect , and cites several reasons for opposing the use of animals in circuses , including confining enclosures , lack of regular veterinary care , abusive training methods and lack of oversight by regulating bodies . 
  animal trainers have argued that some criticism is not based in fact , including beliefs that animals are ` hurt ' by being shouted at , that caging is cruel and common , and the harm caused by the use of *** whips *** , chains or training implements . 
  http://web.archive.org/web/20100507190049/http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/issues_facing_wildlife/circuses/index.html  despite claims to the contrary , trainers often ** use excessive and abusive training methods ** to establish and maintain the control necessary to make animals perform tricks . 
  although positive reinforcement is indeed part of a trainer 's repertoire , it is by no means his or her only tool , and it is not enough to guarantee control of a four-ton elephant in the ring . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/30/animals-circuses-slave-trade-anne-elephant  treated as if they were equipment , animals who are forced to travel and perform in circuses are routinely deprived of proper care and become sick , listless and depressed . 
  many develop neurotic behaviour from the stress and abuse and die far short of their expected lifespan . 
  they spend the vast majority of their lives crammed into transport cages or boxcars and are hauled around from one venue to the next . 
  uk laws require that animals be given a good quality of life . 
  but the rigours of ** transport , cruel training techniques ** and other stresses of circus life make that impossible . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/anne-elephant-owner-guilty-suffering?guni=article:in%20body%20link  on one occasion 69-year-old roberts could also be seen apparently aiming a kick at the animal , known as anne, 
  it 's actually not hard to train animals this way at all . 
  that 's why beating animals to teach them is so widely practiced . 
  it 's a kind of operant conditioning called `` positive punishment '' ( the positive stands for ` active ' rather than `` good/nice '' ) . 
  people use mild forms of positive punishment ( or occasionally negative reinforcement ) to train house pets , but it is much more severe for work animals , and * much * more severe still for working animals in the 1940s . 
  it 's not unheard of for such animals to die as a result of positive punishment . 
  i think doing this to a bear , or a dog is just as extreme as doing it to a child . 
  cruelty is cruelty , no matter who to .
