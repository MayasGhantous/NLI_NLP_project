  i see what you 're saying , and you have illustrated quite well that over saturation could fast become a problem , however , whilst at current levels 10-30 countries could quickly become 50 to 150 news items , these items currently are only one sentence long which makes the entire thread very short . 
  there 's significant scope to give people more freedom . 
  for instance , you could make it mandatory to have a leading sentence which is emboldened and bullet pointed , then followed by a paragraph of context , if the author so chooses . 
  readers can decide whether they want to waste their time with the additional paragraphs or not . 
  the freedom lays with the readers and writers who are the real content creators here . 
  you could also prescribe a rating system , where by each author must rank the articles they link to in order of relevance , so if someone provides 20 links , you know which 5 of them to read if you only want to read five . 
  anyway , it 's really your sub i just think that it would be improved if you had a less prescriptive approach towards content . 
  the rules serve a good purpose , but they need not be so intense and they have a lot of scope to allow freedom whilst achieving their prime function . 
  i do n't know about you , but i like discussing things more than once a year ... often multiple times a year , in fact . 
  sometimes i even like to discuss things every two or three months if it 's interesting . 
  if people want to have a discussion about discourse and quality control every month , what 's to say we should stop it ? 
  if this thread is anything to go by , it seems as though 4 months is pretty optimal given all the great discussion which has taken place . 
  and inadvertently made the interest rates on mortgages rise , undoing any benefit he might have caused to those under financial pressure . 
  it does seem a little restrictive to make people only do a maximum of five points , and only one sentence explaining them . 
  if this thread is anything to go by , people should have ** a lot ** more space than that . 
  you 've got a whole thread to work with , and reddit has no character limit . 
  let people have some creative freedom otherwise no issue is going to have adequate depth . 
  you learn next to nothing by reading solely headlines . 
  just for the sake of keeping the / r/europe about europe , rather than becoming hugely america centric like the rest of reddit/the internet , i think the general policy is not to have american news round ups . 
  we usually get all of that from the rest of reddit anyway , or our national newspapers or broadcasters . 
  to be fair , the uk system , despite being relatively unique ( based on this whole thread ) seems to be one of the only ones which is fraud ( / absenteeism ) proof which is very nice . 
  yeah , a lot of the good journalism across europe is tied up with the ukraine crisis and it is an excellent example of all sorts of national and international phenomena . 
  however , there 's also a lot of space to discuss and view this issues without the ukraine element . 
  i 'm sure you 'll be able to go to the megathread to view everything in a ukraine centric manner , whilst everybody can return to the main page to get a more general understanding of news , discussion et cetera . 
  i know i 'm very tired of reading about the russia-eu situation ** only ** through the ukraine crisis . 
  sure it 's important , but there are still other aspects to the relationship, 
  if you 're referring to the ` what happened in your country this week ' threads which take place on sundays , there 's likely no reason why they ca n't continue and have this as a regular sticky . 
  if they ca n't have two posts stickied simultaneously ( which there must be a way around ) then we can simply have ukraine 6 days of the week and sunday news on sundays , like how national newspapers have one edition everyday ( e.g. 
  the guardian , the daily telegraph ) of the week and on sunday have a special edition ( e.g. 
  sunday telegraph , the observer ), 
  that was four months ago , over a quarter of a year ago . 
  i do n't think we need a moratorium on meta-discussions of the same topic that lasts for months . 
  he does take an almost continually negative stance , and usually a very contrarian one to boot . 
  it 's frequently put provocatively , but whilst i think his/her intentions are often to russle some jimmies , he/she does sometimes make some pretty legitimate points , and sometimes better than anybody else in the thread . 
  so i kind of find it hard to call him/her a troll because sometimes , periodically , he/she does really contribute . 
  i think this actual comment he/she has made is quite good , if a tiny bit alarmist . 
  you know that little warm feeling you occasionally get inside when something very nice happen ? 
  i feel it  i 'm a sixth form student , which is equates to being somewhere between a university student and a secondary school pupil ( i like to think it 's more like university than school , but i am biased ) . 
  and i study history , politics , philosophy , german and outside of sixth form i do french and economics as a hobby , in between reddit sessions . 
  i do n't know too much about communcation studies , but from the introduction on wikipedia , it sounds like i 'll have covered with a fair few of the things it covers . 
  you 've hit upon a very good point about what genuinely is a bad comment and how do you measure this . 
  it 's interesting to hear your experiences on the matter . 
  whilst i have no final conclusion to offer myself , i think there may be hope yet for an actual way of classifying comments and grading them . 
  i would look to the grading method used on a2 and as level mark schemes in the uk . 
  http://www.aqa.org.uk/exams-administration/exams-guidance/find-past-papers-and-mark-schemes this is a helpful website for looking up mark schemes . 
  i recommend the government and politics as level marks schemes as that subject matter is broadly similar to much of what is discussed here . 
  there was also [ this large spreadsheet ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/assets/fallaciesposterhigherres.jpg ) ( [ different link ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/poster ) ) i saw a while ago which i think provides a somewhat good guideline as to what sort of comments are not meaningful . 
  i 'm not sure whether one could turn all of this into a coherent set of rules . 
  i know that the as aqa mark schemes have to be interpreted somewhat liberally but i have hope that a working set of rules could be established , though it would be significantly more difficult to apply these rules to a lot of the cultural content we have on this sub but i hold out hope for that too . 
  edit : added better link to the philosophical fallacies image . 
  the first was unreadable . 
  you can see why some subs have a ban on using image macros . 
  the hasty response with quick return on attention invested quickly drowns out any meaningful content . 
  to sound a bit old and nostalgic , it 's similar to what happened after films and television were introduced . 
  film media predominated over print media and people stopped reading anywhere near the amount they used to . 
  that 's fine and everything , but film is not a complete substitute for literature . 
  there are things which can be expressed in even a short book that a film or tv series would fail miserably to express . 
  obviously television does have its advantages over literature and image macros do have their benefits over long form written content , but the thing is non of these are substitutes for the others and the newest , most attention grabbing forms often steal the spot light from all the others and become substitutes . 
  does tend to lean very left wing , be anti-conservative and anti-politician in general . 
  you can understand why people espouse these views , but i 've sometimes tried to say things which are kind of right wingish or kind of pro-conservative ( neither of these things are all bad ) and it was very difficult to do . 
  you have to be very ontop of your arguments and not be offensive in anyway in order to avoid being downvoted , where as in * any * other subject you 'll get so much more lenience and at the end of the day you 'll never get as good a ratio as if i was saying something which is anti-conservative or left wing and to say it worse . 
  stormfront and other such groups go through phases of attacking specific subs , but they usually pass or the mods adapt and solve the problem . 
  i give it a week , absolute tops and things will be back to normal . 
  it does n't help that there 's an issue in the news currently which runs right on that faultline about where islam belongs in our society which inflames everybody . 
  that 's not what reddiquette is for . 
  rediquette is simple * etiquette * and is not punishable for not adhering to . 
  if you [ look at the reddiquette page ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) you can see that it is merely advisable that you behave according to it . 
   reddiquette is an informal expression of the values of many redditors , as written by redditors themselves . 
  please abide by it the best you can . 
  furthermore , in the same page , you can see that the reddiquette advises you use the up and down vote buttons basically based on whether a comment adheres to the rediquette or not  ** vote ** . 
  if you think something contributes to conversation , upvote it . 
  if you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community , downvote it . 
  ( obviously a lot of the rediquette rules also correspond with / r/europe community rules which happen to be punishable by the mods , but most of it falls under the catagory of the upvoting and downvoting rather than flagging and modding . ), 
  i liked the ukraine crisis threads that we used to have , especially the one 's where the op periodically updated the information at the top of the thread so it was up to date . 
   this always happens when subreddits become large . 
  conductive reasoning . 
  just because something has always been a certain way is not prove that it always will , and certainly not that it always should . 
  it 's not inevitable that this sub or any sub will significantly decline with numbers . 
  through trial and error in other subs we can learn how to deal with this and counter act it . 
  we should take a pro-active approach to deteriorating content, 
  i generally agree with the majority view on this sub ( being pro eu , anti-russia , favouring less us involvement in europe , ect ) but find it hard not to acknowledge that one exists here . 
  just pointing out that those arguing for or against something have a personal connection is nothing more than an ad homonym attack and almost irrelevant to discussion . 
  it in no way discredits the view being expressed . 
  those who are victims of something are just as legitimate in speaking of those grievances as someone who has not been effected . 
   i would love for a concerted campaign of moderation to try to return us to the good old days \u2122 but i detect an unwillingness to either trade popularity for quality or simply to put the work into managing the place closely on a day to day basis . 
  i 'd be behind more heavy moderation . 
  the problem is we need a consistent set of rules and these do n't usually mesh well with a news orientated sub or a sub with wide ranging discussion topics . 
  it works very well on / r/askhistorians where the subject matter and purpose of the sub is clear , but that 's not the case with / r/europe . 
  however , i would definitely be behind greater moderating if we could produce a good code of conduct for them and us plebs . 
  as for the problems of unwillingness , i 'm sure it 's either seasonal ( a lot of the mods are young so have exams and therefor will be back ) or can be solved by having more manpower , so long as there is a clear command structure in the hierarchy of this sub . 
  i know a majority of people on this sub ( as is the case with all subs ) probably would n't make good moderators for all sorts of reasons , but there are definitely enough who would be able to do a job like moderating long term , with the little thanks simply for the sake of increasing the longevity of a site they like . 
  so , we can dream !, 
   it is interesting how `` acceptable views '' can shift wildly depending on what current events are going on . 
  this goes for r/worldnews as well and other similar subreddits , not just r/europe . 
  it makes me wonder if people are really that fickle or if something else is at work . 
  i have a hypothesis on this . 
  it goes beyond reddit and to public opinion in general . 
  you can see in opinion polling that the any given nation 's political opinions change by whole percentage points from week to week based on current events . 
  it 's not like those few percent which goes from one week to pro us and the next week to anti-us ( or any other subject matter ) are the same people . 
  the people who 're arguing loudly and , generally , downvoting have made up their minds firmly and have for quite a while .
