  it 's like saying spain runs the eu because one of the eu commissioners is from spain , or that the uk government is liberal democrat because the lib dems have 50 out of the 360 government seats . 
  there 's a tiny slither of truth in there but for all intents and purposes it 's just a lie and a more obvious lie than most . 
  i take it tthat both of these polls were conducted by the two newspapers ( tageschau und die spiegel ) * directly * and were n't making a particular effort to survey a representative cross-section of society ? 
  it 's worth noting the wealth which political organisations have to try and influence people . 
  for instance the two big political parties in the uk get a few million pounds just from donations . 
  imagine how much money you could raise if you corruptionofy it out of government funds , and you are from a large country . 
  i do n't imagine that these guys are demanding an awful lot of money , so it 'd be pretty insubstantial to pay for them to try and influence western media in this way . 
  tits , but really they can be anything you want them to be at depending on circumstance . 
  such is the beauty of the english language . 
  make sure to learn some words of the common folk too , to balance it out . 
  so for every time you point out the room 's zeitgeist or explain your feeling of fernweh , add in a comment about how great some girl 's baps are , just to balance it . 
  trust me . 
  oh yes you 're right . 
  way down with / u/rastabrother 's comment who asked if there were any nationalist parties which did n't subscribe to conservative or nationalist ideology , but i kind of bleeped that out and assumed he 'd / she 'd said ` far right parties ' instead of just ` nationalist parties ' . 
  yeah , the snp are * definitely * nationalists . 
  all 's good !, 
  sorry for the confusion !, 
  i second that . 
  i remember specifically looking it up to jog my memory when i got back from my most recent outing , because it just so accurately describes the feeling . 
  yeah , if you 're ** left ** of the tories it 's kind of hard to be far ** right ** . 
  i 'm sorry , are you claiming that the snp are a far right party or are n't you ? 
  i think something may have become misinterpreted . 
  they 'd definitely become aligned with one sect or another , but at least they 'd still behave like ordinary politicians should and , you know , sit in parliaments and do the jobs they were elected to do . 
   the scottish national party * snp * far right i really do n't think there 's much of an argument that the snp are far right . 
   dat sense of shame you feel on someone else 's behalf when ( s ) he really screwed up like fremdsch\u00e4men in german ? 
  i suppose i 'm thinking of anti-communism in the older sense , for instance wanting to persecute communists the same way that anti-semites wanted ( want ) to persecute jews . 
  i thought they only advocated the leaving of the european union and eurozone and stopped short of gassing jews and creating a fourth reich , like some of the other far right movements do ? 
  i did n't say they were moderate , just * more * moderate . 
  would n't that be the fourth reich ? 
  it 'd be really interest to see some of the more moderate right wing parties on this , like ukip and alternativ f\u00fcr deutschland ( afd ), 
  i ca n't quite believe that * serious * anti-semitism and anti-communism is still a thing in the modern world . 
  i can understand being anti-israel , but full on anti-semtic like and before the 1930s ? 
  * sigh * slash * groan *, 
  personally i 'd keep nationalism and conservatism in . 
  just because it 's a common cornerstone of far right ideology does n't mean it is n't very interesting !, 
  as a politics student though , i think it 's worth drawing a distinction between ` conservative ' and ` fascist ' . 
  there are genuinely some fascist parties out there in eastern europe and whilst it might look like super conservatism with a whole load of other ingredients thrown in , it is in fact an entirely different creature . 
  for instance , the fascism espoused by mussolini , gentile , hitler and rosenberg could appear to be conservative because both italian and nazi fascism appealed to the past ( in germany to the teutonic knights and in italian to the roman empire ) but conservatism usually denotes maintaining the status quo , where as the fascist movements maintain that radical change in the direction of the past or to correct the mis-directions of history . 
  a lot of the far right movements do n't advocate a maintainance of the status quo ( like conservatism ) but advocate radical change inspired by the past ( which is more akin to fascism ) . 
  which i think is silly because you really ought to have constitutional checks on even directly elected bodies to avoid them acting outside the interests of the electorate . 
  for instance , there 's a constitutional check on the uk 's elected chamber of parliament which stops them from creating an act of parliament prolonging the time until an election ( it can be done , but requires the bill go through the house of lords , and the house of commons ca n't wait a year and pass it anyway like other bills ) . 
  the european union is inspired by the horrors of wwii which arguably began when the nazis stopped using the reichstag to pass legislation and instead used hitler 's office ( which needed only the consent of hitler himself ) . 
  there need to be constitutional checks to ensure certain decisions ca n't be made without super majorities or consent from other parts of the establishment ( e.g. 
  house of lords or a constitutional court ) . 
  another example comes from john stuart mill and his idea of the tyranny of the majority where by he claimed that a majority could do just as much wrong to a minority as a minority of one ( a dictator ) could do to a majority of everyone else . 
  this is why you need s some sort of bill of rights , even in democratic countries . 
  to avoid the majority persecuting innocent minorities, 
  that sounds quite fun - off to sporcle !, 
  really ? 
  did you guys not learned about the french revolution ? 
  the romans ? 
  the egyptians ? 
  the enlightenment ? 
  the renaissance ? 
  the catholic-protestant split ? 
  the scramble for africa ? 
  any of that ? 
  would they be able to point out the different german l\u00e4nder , canadian provinces , russia oblasts ? 
  no because l\u00e4nder / provinces/states = / = countries . 
  i could get maybe a quarter or a third of them though but this just because of i like geography rather than anything else . 
  never once have i used that word genuinely . 
  never once have i met anybody who has used that word genuinely . 
  i study tudor history and am surrounded by people who study tudor history so i have somewhat greater reason to use and come across this term than most , yet it still has n't happened . 
  it 's those archaic grammar rules which made english and britain great !, 
  if you do n't believe we should strive to maintain he greatest language on earth , then you do n't think english is good enough !, 
  vote farage 2014 . 
  i thought `` sollen '' translates to `` shall '' rather than `` should '' . 
  as in `` we * shall * do it '' . 
  a combination of both `` should '' ( implying a sense of right and wrong ) and `` will '' . 
  and i thought `` sollten '' meant `` should '' as `` sollten '' is used in the conditional . 
  `` du solltst ihm hilfen , wenn du nach berlin gehst '' as opposed to `` du sollst ihm hilfen , * weil * du in berlin bist '' i could have this completely the wrong way around though . 
  plot twist : the robots are actually helping us by giving us a noticeable group to consider ` other ' and therefor unite in opposition to , therefor preventing a break down in society over the next most obvious division , therefor preventing large scale civil war . 
  thanks chav bots !, 
  merci beaucoup, 
  i 'm glad we could have this little chat, 
  yes ? 
  i mean , c ? 
  it 's hardly a new dividing line . 
  it 's been there since 2004 . 
  yeah that 's what i was going to say . 
  you could kind of argue that it was russia pulling the strings in ukraine which led to yanukovych and co being so bad that the people rose up against him and then he put the army on the people but that 's kind of a spurious case to make . 
  yanukovych was chiefly responsible for those deaths , then the snipers/berkut themselves and then maybe russian influence . 
  and i think you for it !, 
  ( am i doing it right ? ), 
  but in that case is n't the map kind of wrong as it stipulates the crimea is merely within russia 's ` sphere of influence ' rather than within russia properly ? 
  additional question : is the polish newspaper suggesting that this is a * new * pact and that obama has somehow accepted that ukraine is within russia 's sphere of influence ? 
  that sounds like an absolutely stupid conclusion to be making at this point . 
  translation ? 
  the key is kind of important ... 
  you get the southern counties and we get the even more northernly ones ? 
  the european union has an image problem right ? 
  why do n't we turn ni into a european territory like saarland in the 1940s and say that a ` european authority ' needs to solve the problem . 
  the eu gets a chance to look good ( maybe ) and neither the uk or ireland has to do much !, 
  so , who here is going to be watching it ? 
  * and * bbc news . 
  it 's unsurprising that both of them would do it . 
  there 's [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvipsy_sbfg ) . 
  it 's not perfect and personally i prefer a good book on the topic , but it has most of the fundamentals pretty well covered , even if it is done a bit jarringly . 
  what happened with the first farage clegg debate , which was online available for viewing online and listening on radio , is that bbc news hooked up a stream so that people could watch it on tv . 
  i reckon they 'll do the same for this .
