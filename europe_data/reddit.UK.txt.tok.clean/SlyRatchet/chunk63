  i take that back !, 
  the vatican city !, 
  waaaaait a minute ... 
  / r/nordicunion, 
  i have always felt as though this could be a really good union . 
  we 're both english speaking , tea and beer drinking , fish and chip eating , common good hearted folk . 
  if the british had n't messed everything up so badly in the past , maybe we could contemplate union today , legally . 
  but not now that so many tensions have been raised . 
  it 's a shame . 
  whenever i talk to an irish folk i feel like i 'm talking to a slightly more friendly version of one of my own countrymen . 
  same attitudes to everything and the same appreciation for the same things . 
  maybe next century . 
  note that i say `` visible '' opinion and not just `` present '' . 
  i do n't consider it adequate to have some `` dissenting '' opinion downvoted to oblivion at the bottom of the page . 
  if the content gets upvoted to a visible level * consistently * ( which it does here ) then i consider it to not be a circlejerk . 
  i do n't see how this definition could be unsatisfactory or how / r/europe could qualify for being a cirlejerk whilst this remains the definition . 
  what would you prefer ? 
  nobody 's saying she should n't have a fair trial . 
  we 're just very insulted that a us court is claiming jurisdiction over a european country . 
  it 's not the american courts job to preside over eu and austrian law . 
  it 's for austrian and european courts to do that . 
  so why is n't this happening in a european or austrian court ? 
  that 's what we find so insulting . 
  because saying `` this is just a place filled with people who usually have the same opinion , but there are also people who will consistently contradict the status quo to ensure that a somewhat decent dialog is obtained '' is ' t a very harsh insult . 
  if that 's the definition of circlejerk than i 'm pleased to inform you that / europe is a proud circlejerk !, 
  seriously , a circlejerk infers that opinion goes around in a circle which is n't the case if there is dissenting opinion . 
  having that dissenting opinion forces people to read it and consider their vantage point without simply being washed a long with the current . 
  if you can have visible dissenting opinion and still be a ` circlejerk ' or ` eco chamber ' then i do n't see why it 's such an insult to be one . 
   i do n't think you 'd get ** much ** dissenting opinion  you 'd have ** a lot ** of people agreeing you 'd have a majority , yes , but there 'd be no consensus . 
  / r/europe definitely has majority opinions , but it also has a whole load of dissenting opinions who 'll be willing to debate it in almost every thread . 
  this is about the definition of circlejerk and the definition of eco chamber . 
  to be either one of those you need an absence of visible dissenting opinion . 
  there is plenty of that here and it is , therefor , not an eco chamber or a circlejerk . 
  you can list all about how the * majoritarian * opinion is that of a more heavily integrated europe , or that the * majoritarian * opinions that western europe is subjectively better than the usa , or even the * majoritarian * opinion that austerity is bad , and i will agree with you strongly that a majority of / r/europe will agree . 
  but as soon as you say that there is no opposing opinion then i have to disagree . 
  it 's a diverse sub and you ca n't get consensus on anything . 
  ahhhh , the similarities between dutch and german always astound me . 
  sometimes when i see it written down i swear that dutch is more like high german the high german is to swiss german . 
  if i can tick a few other languages off my bucket list i 'll have to get dutch on there eventually . 
  it 's only a circlejerk when it 's an eco chamber with no dissenting opinion or no visible dissenting opinion . 
  / r/europe ca n't agree on anything . 
  if you put any issue forward i guarantee you there 'll be a sizeable group on either side vehemently disagreeing with each other . 
  will one group often be bigger than the other at any one random time ? 
  yes , usually . 
  is it a circlejerk ? 
  god no . 
  / u/shoryukenist is a good example of a non-majority opinion being represented and being quite visible . 
  if you ask a eurofederate whether / r/europe is pro european federalism they 'll tell you it 's vehemently against it , and if you ask someone in / r/unitedkingdom whether / r/europe is for european federalism they 'll tell you the exact opposite to the eurofederate . 
  it 's very easy to scape goat and pigeon-hole a whole community , but it rarely holds up to any scrutiny . 
  i 'd argue that that quote is more logically unsound than it claims the position it is critiquing is . 
  all it 's doing is saying that the same set of principle , of which the writer is criticising , could be applied to other areas of life and that when those principles * are * applied to other areas of life it seems silly to our sensibilities and is therefor illogical because it * seems wrong * . 
  i 'm not a fan of discerning that things are wrong on such ` prima facie ' grounds . 
  what the position i outlined in previous comments is part of a much larger view of human nature . 
  it 's somewhere in between ` soft ' and ` hard determinism ' . 
  whereby the notion of human freewill is quite intensely questioned . 
  your body is something intensely personal as are certain parts of your emotions . 
  you have a right to a private life just as you have a right not to have your body violated just as you have a right to eat , to a family , to clean water , and all the other things laid down in the eu and un declarations on human rights . 
  non of our other rights are infringed by having our freedom limited in such economic ways , but our right to not have our body violated . 
  what i 'm trying to say is not so much that it 's a slippery slope but that there 's effectively no difference between someone putting a gun to your head or your mother 's head and telling you to do something and economic circumstances making you do something . 
  they 're effectively the same thing . 
  they 're both coercion . 
  these are the only grounds in my opinion on which prostitution should be banned on . 
  i 'm not completely decided on the issue , but i think there 's certainly an argument that nobody ever decides to sell their body freely . 
  your body is yours and yours alone . 
  it takes some serious coercion for you to be put into a position where you think it necessary to sell yourself in that way . 
  i 'm not talking about physical intimidation . 
  i 'm talking about financial hard ship . 
  people prostituting themselves to pay for university . 
  it 's not an unheard ( prostituting yourself to get through ni ) of practice and it 's something i think we should strive to abolish . 
  it 's all very well to say that people should and are not forced to do anything they do n't want to , but the idea of what `` force '' is , does n't hold up to close scrutiny . 
  are you forced to do something if you 're poor , your family is starving and a man says he 'll kill you if you do n't do the thing ? 
  yes you 're being forced . 
  what if you 're family 's not starving , but the angry man will still kill you ? 
  you 're probably being forced . 
  what if the man just suggests that he 'll kill you ? 
  are being forced ? 
  what if there 's no man but your family is starving ? 
  no * person * is forcing you . 
  are you still being forced ? 
  what if you 're in relative poverty eg you can live just fine but you do n't enjoy certain standards of living that we expect in europe such as a 24/7 heated house , cooked food and broadband ? 
  are you being forced into doing something then , just because you 're standards of living would be so low if you did n't do the thing ? 
  i 'm not suggesting i have the answer to any of these questions , but it should be clear that you can interpret some of them as being forced , some of them not so much and some of them in the middle . 
  what should be clear is that there is definitely an element of force in * all of them * . 
  whether that element is non-negligible is a matter for debate . 
  i 'm gon na be boring and use the [ british coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_united_kingdom.svg ) but ** wait ** , there are good reasons . 
  edit : here 's a [ jpeg ] ( http://www.bryanrawlings.com/pics/5ft-royal-no-helmet-special-500.jpg ) the symbolism in it is pretty fascinating . 
  see the lion and the unicorn ( btw , yeah , our coat of arms has a unicorn on it ) . 
  the lion is the national animal of england and the unicorn is the national animal of scotland . 
  the crowns which both animals wear ( on the lions head and the unicorn 's neck ) represent the presence of the monarchy . 
  the phrase at the bottom `` dieu et mon droite '' is french , despite the de facto official language being english , it 's an interesting nod to the history of french in england and the uk . 
  it means `` god and my right '' , which is just as ambiguous in french as it is in english . 
  it 's meant to be something the king or queen would say . 
  it 's the national motto , not that any british person knows that . 
  the harp on the bottom left segment of the shield in the middle presents ireland , which is odd given that most of ireland has n't been part of england for around a hundred years . 
  i just really love the intense symbolism in the crest and the huge amount of history behind it . 
  would you say the absence of sunshine could be a culture shock though ? 
  if the answer is yes , then it 's only logical that an excess of sunlight is just as shocking . 
  i know i 'd find it hard to imagine living in a warm country . 
  the asshole thing is just big city syndrome . 
  i was in manchester once and in a big shop on one of the main streets .
