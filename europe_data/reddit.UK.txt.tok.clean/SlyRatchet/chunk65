  that 's the pinnacle point i was trying to make and i think it fits in quite well with what you 're trying to say . 
  i do n't think you 're being a dick , but i also do n't think you can `` correct '' what i said in the normal manner in which the word is used . 
  to correct something implies that you are an objective voice of higher reasoning capable of making definitive statements about a subject . 
  no offence , but i do n't think you are on this subject . 
  you 've put forward some good arguments ( which i 'll reply to later ) but there still only a different way of viewing the same information and non of it is objectively true or worthy of being called a `` correction '' . 
  you 're simply discussing the issue , but you 're not proving to me anything . 
  by all means , discuss to your heart 's content and i 'll never think you 're being a dick because of it , but please do n't see what you 're doing as `` correcting '' people . 
  i think it 's apparent in one of the other responses that some of the things you 've said are just as debetable os what i 've said . 
  until you prove that you are literally god and therefor capable of a higher level of reasoning and a certain level of omnipotence then i do n't think you can `` correct '' other people in the manner you want to . 
  i think the ideals american stood on in the 18th century were that of person freedom , more than of a lack of state interference . 
  for them they were essentially the same thing , but now we know that 's a na\u00efve view . 
  i think that if that , for these ideas , freedom from the state is simply a means to the ends of reaching a greater level of freedom and therefor , if the state could be relied on to enhance and not hinder freedom , than it is very much in line with these ideals . 
  it 's a good show and when i do watch it i feel very up to date , i just do n't watch it very often because my opinion of broadcast news is very low in general and i feel more comfortable with text . 
  there 's a live feed on its website , but i do n't think it runs on any tv stations . 
  there 's also the daily politics show ( or whatever it 's called ) which does a round up of eu news every week or something . 
  i think the founding fathers would probably have a heart attack when the found out the senate was directly elected and both houses of congress had women and black people in it . 
  it 's either that that would kill them , or that the usa has the most expensive army in the world , let alone an army at all . 
  or maybe they 'd be wondering what all these gosh darn nosy automobile things are . 
  the founding fathers were exceptional for their time , as would be the ancient greeks , but their philosophies and opinions are both heavily dated and would n't actually be worth much today . 
  sometimes i think continental europe is more dedicated to the ideals america was founded on than america is . 
  let 's not forget that most of the justification for the us 's birth came from european philosophers like john locke ( a scots-man/briton , iirc ) . 
  one of the main principles that the usa kept up the majority of its existence was to not have a permanent standing army and not to interfere in the rest of the worlds ' affairs . 
  that steams to pretty much be most of continental ( so not britain ) europe 's stance . 
  leave the rest of the world to do its own thing and do n't spend too much on on military power projection . 
  only three eu countries spend more than 2 % of their gdp on defence ( france , greece and the uk ) and that 's dwarfed compared to the usa 's 5 % of gdp . 
  we 're not saints but our more pragmatic rather than ideological approach to most of the values the us follows seems to have worked out pretty well so far . 
  we have good democracies which are being continually reformed and improved , which is juxtaposed to the us 's rigid model which has hardly been changed in decades ( that 's a compliment as well as a criticism ) . 
  we generally do n't allow free speech on such ideological grounds as to let the westborro baptist 's church or koran/bible burning , but this can be argued against by questioning whether or not burning something is a meaningful act of speech . 
  the same way pornography does n't fall under the protection of freedom of expression because it 's not really expression in normal way we think of it . 
  it works out better to have these minor limitations on free speech so that the broader principle is protected , without free speech becoming a chafing problem . 
  we also take a more pragmatic approach with state interference . 
  instead of seeing all state intervention as essentially a restriction of freedom ( taxation , workers ' rights , environmental restrictions ) , we see state intervention in people 's lives as an enhancement of freedom . 
  whilst there 's nothing stopping a disabled woman from glasgow from attending university or having a job and therefor she 's technically `` free to go to university or have a job '' there are ` effective ' restrictions on her ability to do those things . 
  the state needs to step in to either enable her to do these things ( making universities fit ramps , for instance ) . 
  our governments do n't just go willy nilly into people 's lives ( mostly ) . 
  the intervention we take is usually justified under the grounds of promoting further freedom ( john stuart mill started arguing for this kind of progressive liberalism towards the end of his life ) . 
  i could do this for a long time , but you get what i 'm trying to say . 
  i 'm pleased with some of our collective ideals and our pragmatic attitudes towards them . 
  i look forward to seeing us improve in future . 
  * to the scary topless man riding a horse *, 
  at least china 's moving forward in many ways , economic liberalisation and slight improvements to their human rights record in recent years , for instance . 
  however russia recently seems to have taken several steps backwards with intent to move forwards . 
  we should boycott those who move backwards and allow some leeway on those who are bad but make progress . 
  as someone studying a similar topic , could you point me in the direction of the information which brought you to the `` 50 % under funded '' figure ? 
  that would be extremely useful to bring up in a debate , 
  yes i boevw there should be less australians . 
  there should be less of everyone , otherwise it 's unsustainable . 
  i think that europe 's slow depopulation is a force for good, 
  if europeans were to slowly die out then we should allow it to happen . 
  there 's too many people on this earth and until we get space colonies ( seriously , europe should totally lead in space colonisation ) we really should n't be incentivising increasing the human population . 
  it 's full to bursting point already . 
  european culture will live on as the rest of humanity survives . 
  we 've made quite an impact on world history so i doubt we 'll be forgotten . 
  we can pass on our culture and history to those who are not like us genetically . 
  i do n't think that we should force people not to have kids , it 's your right to have children if you so desire , but i think those who willing choose not to are doing humanity a valuable favour by not contributing to all the problems caused by a huge human population . 
  it 's called [ afro-eurasia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afro-eurasia ) . 
  the uk is second to top ? 
  huh ? 
  funnily enough that 's actually kind of what ` grand coalition ' means in german . 
  in german `` gro\u00dfe / grosse '' means `` big '' and `` grand '' and a few other synonyms at the same time . 
  for instance ` alexander the great '' is ` alexander der gro\u00dfe ' and ` grand coalition ' is ` gro\u00dfkaolition / gro\u00dfe kaolition ' . 
  i do n't think it 's so sinister as that . 
  it 's more like house of lords reform . 
  everybody wants the path of a seceding member state to be more clear and everybody wants the house of lords to be reformed . 
  however nobody can agree on how to reform the house of lords and nobody can agree on how a seceding member state should be treated . 
  it 's in almost nobody 's interests for things to be uncertain ( even the spanish government ) but practical hurdles hinder the process of determining such things . 
  the places where it already comes from , only we 'll have to pay , on the whole , 3billion less because of savings made by halting all the duplication of resources and capabilities . 
  or we could restructure it to make countries which are n't france and the uk pay more of their fair share , but it will only ever cost less than it already does . 
  from my experience , whilst polls might say people are no longer in favour of war and that they would not condone war/foreign intervention if ( specific set of ) circumstances came to be , those opinions will change dramatically as soon as such a situation arises . 
  we feel very safe now that it 's been several years since the death of osama , over a decade since the twin towers fell and over twenty years since the soviet union dissolved . 
  what 's there to worry about ? 
  in this position of relative security we can all have a nice long think about war and armies and defence spending and morality , but when the international stage becomes tense again and people start feeling threatened then all that talk of morality and defence cuts will change to ` do whatever it takes to make me safe again ' . 
  it 's completely understandable . 
  there was a lot of opposition to iraq as it happened , but it 's almost universally considered a bad thing now that it passed , mostly because we 're not scared of saddam anymore and we know that the evidence for going in was fault . 
  we ( the pulbic ) did n't know that at the time and therefor felt threatened and therefor felt invasion was necessary . 
  additionally before the twin towers felt people thought that intervening in foreign affairs was pretty unnecessary and maybe even morally wrong . 
  the ussr was gone , what 's there to be scared of ? 
  nothing , that is until something happens as it did in 2001 . 
  tl ; dr : people feel differently when they 're threatened, 
  could you elaborate on why it 's terrible ? 
  the whole purpose of reddit is to debate , not to idealy state opinions , 
  eastern europe is n't as well developed as western europe , therefor its all been a failure ? 
  disagree . 
  eastern europe has made huge strides whilst part of the eu and continues to do so . 
  poland is predicted to overtake the uk in a matter of decades in terms of gdp and eastern european states are much more democratic than they were largely because of the eu . 
  are eastern european states as democratic as some of the western european states ? 
  i really do n't know . 
  some eastern european countries like estonia are probably a lot more democratic , but even if you look at the ones who 've reformed less , they 're still kilometres better than where they were and that 's how i measure success . 
  i measure success with improvement . 
  was there improvement ? 
  yes . 
  then it was and is a success and is continuing to be a success so we should do more of it . 
  i highly doubt the americans do n't already know where snowden is . 
  he 's meet with meps and journalists already and if they we 're to believe what snowden is telling us , they could have easily tracked those people on their way to see him , if they have n't found and started intercepting his personal messages already . 
   die kanzlei verschickte in dieser woche ** mehrere hundert abmahnungen ** an internetsurfer `` the chancellery sent ** several hundred warnings ** away at internet surfers this week . '', 
  absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . 
  just because david cameron has not displayed all his skills does not mean they are n't there . 
  i dare you to find a recording of merkel speaking english , despite being quite able in the language . 
  it 's part of the conservative ideology to see society as smattered with different kinds of people all in a hierarchy . 
  translators have an important roll in that hierarchy and we need people to fill that roll .
