  so now that romania has eu membership ( with some restrictions which will hopefully be lifted soon ) and nato membership , that makes moldova the top item on the agendum ? 
  why would being employed mean that you ca n't get employment in the future ? 
  are there laws in belgium restricting you from leaving your job under certain circumstances ? 
  surely you 'll be able to court potential new employers whilst being underemployed and if one of those employers decides to take you then you can leave your current place of work for something which is more in line with what you 're qualified for . 
  eg : you can leave a job if you do n't like it in order to get a better job . 
  whilst that is a frightening prospect which i share , i 'd rather be underemployed and worried about fresh blood competing with me in the future than being * unemployed * and still having the same fears . 
  at least in the first example i am actually making a basic income but with fears of the future , but in the second example i have all the same fears but not even a basic income . 
  i want to know what ducrozet means by `` accommodation '' . 
  it 's a rather vague term . 
  i 'd rather been in a job i 'm over qualified for than not have a job . 
  willing employment is better than unwanted unemployment . 
  ach , i reached for the word `` when she was pm '' and got `` when she was alive '' instead : / brain malfunction, 
  british person ; can agree . 
  the less said about thatcher the better chance you have of not stepping on people 's toes . 
  just vaguely agree with whatever the people you 're talking to are saying about her . 
  i have absolutely no opinion because i was n't a live when she was pm and yet people my own age will still get angry at me if i even suggest that they might not be the villain/saint they see her as . 
  edit : i did n't live through her premiership, 
  blair tried to do that by giving all the different scotland , wales and ni their own assemblies ( which he did ) and the various regions of england their own ( which , when put to referendum , failed ) . 
  the people of england did n't want to decentralisation , apparently : /, 
  8 out of 13 , but i could only spell 6 out of 13 correctly :( i kept calling the northwest territories the `` northern territories '' and fuck the spelling of sasketchuan . 
  i fucking suck at naming counties . 
  i can do south yorkshire ( where i live ) , cornwall and devon and maybe a in the essex/norfolk region , but after that i have no clue . 
  i can do 80 % of us states and every single country in europe but i just ca n't learn the counties . 
  i 've just never wanted to or had any reason to, 
  you know there 's no state called `` new england '' ? 
  it 's just a collective term for all the states north/east of new york . 
  it 's like the term ` west coast ' or ` the south ' or ` mid west ' . 
   the british media ( especially the bbc ) has been tying itself in knots trying to make out that the ridiculous william hague was the central figure in this . 
  has it ? 
  i was reading i the other day and it had a special column dedicate to her role in the affair . 
  hague was n't mentioned apart from in the caption of the picture , a picture which featured john kerry and baroness ashton hugging with hague somewhere in the background . 
  mind blown i memorised them anyway , but i did n't know that there was such a simply way . 
  [ but the government always tells the press everything !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diuqixt5qe4&amp;t=19m30 ), 
  i 've just spent about five minutes trying to find a gif which encapsulates my surprise at reading that headline . 
  no gif quite articulates my sudden mixture of happy surprise and respect . 
  hopefully this will work and hopefully she still gets released in the end . 
  whilst russia would only be proportionally as big as germany in the early days , germany was n't quite so exceptionally big back then . 
  where as russia would be big without equal which is my problem . 
  it would be much more united in terms of getting its eu policy accepted than all the other small countries . 
  you 'd need almost the entire rest of the eu to agree on something together to counter what russia wants . 
  i 'm not sure what you meant about the councillors . 
  whilst this ended up being quite an extensive piece of writing , i 'd like to point out that it 's not comprehensive . 
  if others read the linked article i 'm sure you 'll find other things worth talking about . 
  the canadian historians would probably find a wider variety of opinions useful . 
  if they reformed * heavily * with regards to human rights , democracy , corruption , economics , and so on . 
  basically all the normal eu candidates have to do . 
  ** but there is a more fundamental issue : ** is russia too large ? 
  germany is currently the largest eu state in terms of population , with 80 million inhabitants , followed by france and the uk with about 60 million . 
  russia , on the other hand , has a population of 140 * million * . 
  almost double germany 's population . 
  that would increase the eu 's population by over 20 % ( eu pop : 500 million ) . 
  i 'm not sure the eu would be able to cope with such a large member state . 
  russia would probably have to be broken up into smaller chunks in order for it to not absolutely dominate eu policy decisions . 
  this is n't a tyranny of the majority problem either . 
  i 'm talking about a huge member state being represented by one figure head at the council of ministers and probably with huge numbers of meps in the eu parliament ready to back him up . 
  that will allow the leader of russia to manipulate eu policy more than their population would allow by itself . 
  there 's a multiplier effect when something is so large . 
  additionally it does highlight some other problems in that a tiny eu state like luxembourg or malta with about half a million people would be able to veto certain issues , even if the 140 * million * russians approved of it . 
  aj , yeah you 're right . 
  i 'll read through and try to pick out some analyses of the situation which i think disagree with  earlier this year , the european union ( eu ) welcomed croatia as the 28th member state , a decision which caused ** some degree of controversy ** . 
  while some commentators claimed that the eu had already overstretched its boundaries , many politicians in the european community remain convinced that expanding the eu and signing european economic agreements is the optimal choice for the continent 's prosperity . 
  i 'm curious as to what this controversy was . 
  from what i understand the goal of eu expansion , especially with regards to croatia , is fairy well established and entrenched among the european political class . 
  it was fairly unanimously accepted and celebrated rather than discussed . 
   if any institution has begun to stagnate , though , it 's the eu . 
  to be sure , the people of greece or portugal are not on the road to prosperity and modernization that bildt describes . 
  while eu membership and various agreements have worked for some areas , there are salient ** problems within the eu that require attention ** . 
  turkey has benefited to some degree by the eu customs union , but to claim that the entire country and its people have experienced the relatively newfound wealth is misleading . 
  the same could be said for romania and bulgaria . 
  the objective for the eu is integration and universal prosperity , but in praxis , however , ** wealth remains unevenly distributed ** . 
  to what degree is integration and prosperity possible for a country on the periphery like the ukraine ? 
  as for problems within the european union . 
  there 's no reason why integration and reform ca n't take place concurrently . 
  considering the almost geological time scale in which reform and integration takes place , it would almost be silly not to do them concurrently . 
  it 's taken croatia many years to be at a level at which it can join the eu and ukraine is n't signing an association agreement to join the eu , simply to become more closely integrated into the eu economy . 
  so ukraine it will be many years until ukraine is able to fulfil the association agreements it would have signed at the summit in vilnius , and then it would have taken many years longer , assuming both the eu and ukraine want ukraine to be an eu member , for ukraine to actually be of a standard where it could join the eu . 
  wealth remaining unevenly spread is n't such an important issue . 
  it 's an important issue when considering capitalism as a whole and considering the merits of various kinds of capitalism , but we 're mostly in agreement about what kind of capitalism we want to aspire to . 
  relatively open markets but with a little bit of social welfare . 
  additionally the criticism of wealth within eu states being unevenly spread is kind of dwarfed when you look at how badly wealth is concentrated within russia and former soviet union states . 
  as for whether integration for a peripheral country is possible or not . 
  well that 's kind of simple as well . 
  it works best for countries at the periphery , poland and the baltic states being prime examples . 
   the commentary on eu expansion is emblematic of broader international relations discussions in which scholars use and apply paradigms and frameworks . 
  generalizations and patterns about european growth versus stagnation are applied to what is ultimately an extremely disparate series of states and nations that comprise the eu and european economic community . 
  in short , what worked for country `` x '' will work for country `` z. '' this is highly problematic as it fails to consider regional disparities and local challenges to stability and integration . 
  each state offers variegated challenges to integration . 
  whilst this is true , to an extent , one of the main arguments in father of a more centralised europe is that we 're all pretty similar anyway , together as europeans . 
  whilst each state does offer different problems , this is also reflected in the association agreements being tailored to each individual state . 
  the eu does n't apply a one-size-fits-all method . 
  it is altered to help accommodate . 
  you do have to be of a good enough standard to enter , but , the talks are * bi * lateral . 
  it 's a negotiation and not a command . 
   that the eu hopes to complete agreements with the ukraine when there are clearly signs of systemic problems , namely corruption , emphasizes the importance the eu places on economics over human rights or socio-economic equality . 
  the ukrainian parliament refused to allow imprisoned opposition leader yulia tymoshenko to leave jail for medical treatment . 
  the eu and other states have accused the current president of holding former prime minister tymoshenko in prison after an obviously corrupt and partisan trial . 
  this corruption , however , represented just a minor hurdle for the eu in trade talks . 
  personally i just disagree with your interpretation of this , which , i think , is what you were more looking for . 
  the wrongful imprisonment of tymoshenko has been a major issue for the eu , so much so , in fact , that the eu probably would not have signed the agreement had tymoshenko not been released .
