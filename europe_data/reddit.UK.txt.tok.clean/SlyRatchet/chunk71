  half of the actual content is just a rehash of the same old issues : high speed 2 which would extent the track the trains from the channel tunnel run on all the way to birmingham and then sheffield and manchester , the big six energy companies and their excessive electricity prices , the royal baby and prince philip 's ( the queen 's husband ) ailing health . 
  british gibraltar keeps coming up too . 
  why do all the papers have a daily circulation ? 
  surely it would be better just to have one addition per week which covers all the important news rather than a different one everyday which covers a bunch of pointless stuff . 
  i thought that 's what the weekend additions would do , but no . 
  they just fill that with a lot of commentaries by high profile figures and travel magazines and tv magazines . 
  the actual newspaper bit of it is just the same bit you can buy any other day of the week . 
  nah , it 's spelled like this  university, 
   plus bosnia is the most important country in the whole umm ... bosnia and herzegovina !, 
  finally something bosnia and herzegovina can be proud of :p, 
  i dare say !, 
  what sort of an undignified reproach as that ! ... 
  oh who are we kidding ... our electoral system is even worse than the americans , and we 've got the two party system disease almost as bad :( we even have a chamber of parliament filled with 100 or so ** hereditary ** members !, 
  i ca n't believe we saddled most former british empire countries with the same westminster system . 
  poor fellers . 
  that 's even worse than the anti-homosexual laws we left them with . 
  different parts of the uk have wildly different views on the role of the uk army and the actions it has and would take . 
  just look at the debate on nuclear weapons , and that 's without even considering the arguments on conventional forces or iraq ( both during and after the event ) . 
  anyway , we seem to run a fairly efficient army that most people are * fairly * happy with despite these differences in opinion . 
  the uk gov would like a word with your school about their views on britain, 
  ex-post means exactly the same thing as crosspost . 
  the term ex-post is in common usage throughout reddit , arguably more than crosspost http://www.reddit.com/search?q=ex-post, 
  it 's not just that the top 0.5 % have the most influence , they can also leave as many did when fran\u00e7ois hollande was introducing his new rich tax . 
  that , and they can also evade or avoid it tax . 
  rights generally in china have n't been very well respected even before free trade . 
  it would be just as disingenuous to claim that china has poor workers ' rights because of free trade than it would be to claim , as geert wilders did in the linked article , that free trade is the reason norway is doing well , when in fact the real reason is oil . 
  what new east vs west drama ? 
  i only know of the old east vs west drama, 
  other prospective eu member states might see it as setting a precedent , and then when we do n't treat them the same way they will cry `` hypocrisy '' and unfortunately they 'll probably be right . 
  but this is international relations . 
  this is about achieving goals , not about being fair . 
  there 's actually a danger that ukraine will go somewhere else , but that fear just is n't there with the balkan countries or turkey which , in future , will allow us to be much more solid with our demands . 
  there 's still a chance that ukraine will be allowed to sign the agreement without freeing tymoshenko . 
  i mean , does the european union really think it that important that they would let ukraine go back into the russian sphere of influence just because they have n't yet released tymoshenko . 
  do n't get me wrong , they definitely should and it 's very important that they do sp as soon as possible , but it 's not worth putting ukraine in the russian sphere over this . 
  ensuring that ukraine continues democratising and progressing is very important and not worth halting just because ukraine has n't done it fast enough . 
  i think the european diplomats will go along with this line of thinking . 
  come on guys , you do n't need to downvote people just because their view is different to yours . 
  yeah i like the idea of joining the euro , but i 'm not gon na downvote people who hold opposing points of view . 
  but he will if you start drinking protein shakes and doing bench presses until you become arnold schwarzenegger . 
  this is a very good point i want to address  but , that said , while the european union does have a larger economy , it also has a less integrated and stable political structure . 
  this was highlighted with greece , where the possibility of one country pulling out cast doubts on the entire euro , and fears that the entire currency itself would collapse . 
  that type of thing simply would n't happen with the usd , even if worse came to worse , the usd would survive , even if in a mangled , horrid form , and i think that gives it a little more security . 
   for the euro to overcome the usd as the world 's reserve currency , i believe that the european union has to integrate further , national countries would need to give up a little more sovereignty and the union would have to stop acting like a nation in name only . 
  the e.u. 
  's legislature and executive would need to be given more legitimacy , and more power ( which would require , as i mentioned before , european nations giving up more sovereignty ) . 
  and all of this , of course , would probably need to be done with getting britain fully-committed to the e.u. 
  & dropping the pound for the euro , and all e.u. 
  countries agreeing on a common , united foreign policy ( and militarily as well , mali the perfect example ) . 
  whilst the eurozone debt crisis brought to attention a lot of the problems with the euro as an idea in its then current form , the very fact that it survived will probably quell any fears in the future because of the way it survived . 
  the richer countries just bailed out the poorer ones in what is similar to a transfer union . 
  this is a component of most nation states like the us . 
  everyone puts money into the big pot and then the pot gets divided up in terms of who needs it most . 
  for instance texas puts in a lot of money into the us ' pot and gets little back whilst mississippi puts little in and gets a lot out because mississippi is the one that needs . 
  the analogy is the same for german and greece . 
  the reason this financial crisis was so scary was because it was something completely new . 
  it tested things which had never been tested before . 
  it did n't undermine the usd or any other currency in the same way because we 'd already seen that the usd and other currencies had gone through the same hurdles and passed easily , as the euro has proven it can and will do . 
  additionally , this [ ` bank supervisor ' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19999998 ) is still in the process of being constructed and once completed will exemplify exactly the kind of sacrifice of sovereignty you 've just said needs to be conceded . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** so i think the hurdle of needing to concede national sovereignty and the hurdle of the eu/euro 's future stability and longevity have actually already been solved or will be solved soon ( i 'm waiting for the banking supervisor to actually be finished before i call it completely solved ) . 
  does anybody think that maybe if this free trade agreement with the us were to go through , that , perhaps , the european union , under the leadership of the european commission , would actually have the upper hand and ability to dictate terms to the us once inside . 
  i mean , the gdp of the european union is larger than the usa 's by a trillion us$ . 
  that lead is worth two belgiums , or two polands , or the netherlands and portugal combined . 
  that 's quite a substantial lead , and whilst the us economy is growing at a slightly faster rate , the eu makes up for that partially by accepting a new member worth several hundred billion euros every so often . 
  so the power balance is unlikely to change in the near future . 
  so what about it ? 
  surely this would allow us to have some serious leverage over the usa in a way no other government does . 
  yeah yuan , yen and icelandic kr\u00f3ner are just in a league of their own . 
  tbf there 's a lot of things which could make the us$ lose its status as international reserve currency in the next couple of decades . 
  there 's obviously the chinese yuan , but also some risk from , surprisingly , the euro . 
  if the euro makes it through the crisis and continues to incorporate other eu members into it , as appears to be the case given the recent move by latvia ( or is it lithuania ? ), 
  to adopt the euro . 
  assuming that the euro makes it through the crisis , which now is almost a certainty , it 's going to end up being more important internationally than it already is . 
  the economy of the european union is already bigger than the us economy by a trillion dollars . 
  eg , we could remove all of poland and belgium and still be in the lead . 
  additionally , the european union is going to continue accepting more member states which will eventually become eurozone member states as well . 
  oh * and * the european central bank is n't devaluing the euro in the same way that the bank of england and america are doing , so it 's going to continuing gaining value relative to other currencies . 
  i can dream ca n't i !, 
  the main thing i find surprising about this is how little an individual dollar is worth compared to a euro or pound .

  when one makes a comment , it is not as if they have the decision to make a constructive of point or a joke and to do one necessitates not doing the other . 
  most of the time when one makes a joke , they had and would n't have had any intention or motivation to make an insightful point , just like those who made insightful points probably had no intention or motivation to make a joke . 
  surely more content is better than less content , especially with reddit 's voting system , which allows for uninteresting material to be deprioritised , so as not to clutter and overwhelm readers . 
  ergo , nothing is lost by jokes being made instead of constructive argument and being upset by the creation of more content which will interest or entertain more people is not something worth being upset by and instead should be enjoyed , for more content leads to a better world . 
  was that a constructive enough point ? 
  :p i guess it was n't on the subject you wanted , but i thought you were making a joke in the first place anyway , so did n't see much harm in continuing the joke . 
   if he 's preaching austerity why would he get rid of a gold throne ? 
  that makes no sense when it 's probably an antique . 
  you could complain about the food , staff and other costs but the gold throne ? 
  come on ... - senior member of the conservative party, 
  this is only assuming that this universal unconditional minimum wage was so high that there was no financial incentive for people to work . 
  however this is not the case . 
  it 's simply a * minimum * wage which all will receive . 
  enough to feed yourself and clothe yourself but little more . 
  enough to obtain a basic standard of life that is expected in the 1st world . 
  if you wanted further luxuries you 'd have to work for them . 
  if a universal unconditional minimum wage was installed it would be no great difference to the current system in most eu countries . 
  if you are out of work in the uk you get # 5 a week job seekers allowance and further benefits on top where eligible . 
  you just have to fill out * loads * of paper work for it and deal with loads of bureaucracy . 
  so this minimum wage is only really streamlining the benefits which you are already entitled to and guarantee the standards of living we already have .
