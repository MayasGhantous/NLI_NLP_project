  i mean , the collective opinion in many places 100 years ago was that gay people should have their private parts chemically removed . 
  that was part of the reason alan turing c. 1945 committed suicide . 
  additionally many people in the uk think that the proportion of the uk that is muslin is roughly ten times bigger than it actually is . 
  anyway , i do n't place much value in people 's opinions compared to hard evidence . 
  though i do accept there might be problems with the census . 
  it would be nice to hear what those problems are and why it might be underestimating the ` true ' number . 
  do you have a source for the ` second most imprisoned nationality ' statistic ? 
  if all those statistics are accurate then it must be understood that the chances of each individual roma being a criminal is quite high relative to other ethnic groups . 
  however , the number of roma people who enter the uk in the near or even far future wont be very high . 
  romania and bulgaria have been in the eu for over five years . 
  them joining schengen wont be any huge change even if they wont be easily turned away at the uk-schengen border because they have n't been getting turned away at the romania-schengen border either . 
  even if the uk was a member of schengen , it wont mean that any great change will happen because there is so much space for the roma to spread out into . 
  there 's a whole continent and 28 different countries . 
  they 're not gon na decide that `` this island right here is * juuuust right * . 
  the absolute worst thing i predict happening from a uk perspective is that over the next * several * years the number of roma people doubles . 
  which wont be much of a problem . 
  would i rather it not double ? 
  sure , whatever . 
  is the benefit of letting romanians travel freely throughout the schengen area a worthy price to pay ? 
  of course . 
  depends on whether or not amish children have a chance to integrate into normal society should they choose to and whether or not they have a decent quality of life there . 
  plus whether or not there is a cycle of criminality . 
  if they amish children are ** n't ** brought up to be criminals ( stealing , fraud type of crimes ) and are given an education then i do n't really see why they should be separated . 
  the way the communities tend to be quite insular bothers me , but i do n't know to what extent this is true . 
  so long as they know they can leave and that there is a world outside of their community then i guess i 'm ok with it . 
  the support system for kids without parents is , admittedly , pretty awful in most places , but would you rather be in a care system like that with * some kind of a future * a head of you or trapped in a life of squaller and crime with your genetic family . 
  additionally you 've got to take into account wider society . 
  we all benefit from sending children to school and to education because they become educated and contributing members of society with valuable skills to make use of . 
  every one benefits from being surrounded by people like that . 
  we do n't just send children to school so they can benefit . 
  we send them to school so that we can have better lives also . 
  so if you flip that around , if kids do n't go to school then they can easily become a drain on society , stealing from others . 
  so that 's an extra element to add into the equation , would giving that child a chance to have a decent future + the benefit society has from that child not becoming a thief or worse , before enough to justify taking the child away from its family ? 
  personally i err on the side of separating the child from its parents . 
  for everyone 's sake as well as the child . 
  everyone deserves an equal chance in in life . 
   with the border controls soon to fall the uk will have more of them to deal with do n't count on it . 
  there 's not that many roma people in romania ( [ ~ 600,000 according to the 2011 romania census ] ( http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rezultate-definitive-rpl_2011.pdf ) ) and bulgaria ( [ ~ 300,000 according to the 2011 bulgarian census ] ( http://www.nsi.bg/census2011/pdocs2/census2011final_en.pdf ) ) and there 's plenty of other eu countries between them and the united kingdom . 
  furthermore , the uk is not part of schengen and * is an island * so the roma will need to actually state there reasons for coming to the uk at which point they 'll probably be turned away . 
  just to put that into perspective a little , the uk has a net immigration of about 200,000 every year ( [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11094468 ) ) . 
  so unless about a quarter of bulgaria * and * romania 's roma population upsticks and moved to the uk * all the in the same year * , then you 're probably not going to feel much difference . 
  there 's plenty of other places for romania and bulgaria 's roma population to head to . 
  even if the entirety of their roma left for other eu countries , there would only be a few thousand arriving in each eu country . 
  insignificant in the scheme of things . 
  the eu on the whole will be benefitted by allowing the roma to ` rome ' freely a long with all other bulgarian and romanian citizens . 
  i think there 's a difference between roma , the culture ; and roma , the ethnicity/race . 
  i have absolutely no problem with people who are ethnically romani , which sounds like the people you have in finland . 
  it 's people who subscribe to the romani culture who are a problem . 
  as a culture it 's just objectively bad . 
  there 's nothing wrong with them as human beings , just the culture the 've adopted . 
  from the sounds of it , roma in finland do n't have the culture because they 've stuck around in one place long enough to get a job . 
  if they actually did have the culture then they 'd mostly just steal instead of actually working for wages . 
  i think this is actually very useful because the finnish roma prove that there 's little to nothing inherently bad about being ethnically a roma . 
  it 's all to do with the culture and the upbringing , not the eugenics . 
  could n't you confiscate the children on the grounds that they are n't giving their children a proper education and/or quality of life ? 
  i mean , from my perspective that is exactly what 's happening . 
  i 'm absolutely fine with home education ( i was home educated ) but i think that most roma children who are `` home educated '' are n't actually given an education in any traditional sense . 
  they are being hurt by their family and never given the option to integrate into society and for that reason the parents are unfit to be parents and , therefor , should n't be allowed to look after kids . 
  and onwards to eu membership !, 
  that is quite a lot , but somehow i was expecting there to be more . 
  there 's non with australia and almost non in asia apart from jordan , israel , turkey . 
  any opinions on this ? 
  good ? 
  bad ? 
  bit of both ? ... 
  anything ? 
  it 's interesting that anti-europe parties are the most pan-european political idea out there right now . 
  reminds me of the bnp , the uk 's resident far right nationalist party . 
  they 're fucking crazy and stupid , but they 're not pro war . 
  not at all . 
  well it 's very important to the economy of strasbourg and if any french president ever allowed it to be lost then they would probably be vilified in the eyes of those who live in strasbourg . 
  so any french president who does that would have to be pretty confident that strasbourg 's vote does n't matter in the next election * and * all the french nationalists in the country who would see it as a lost in terms of economics and national pride . 
  one of the most realistic proposals for making france accept the parliament having one seat in brussels , was to give the french some other important european institution . 
  cern and the esa are already stationed in france but the eu court has also been mentioned . 
  it 's one possibility . 
  unless i god a call from heisenberg ten minutes previously , yes . 
  always . 
  i never knew central europe had so many ports . 
  czechia , hungary and maybe austria have a port + one near/in switzerland . 
  on another note , someone can be prime minister of belgium on nine different occasions ? 
  how does that work ? 
   ** remember ** : please state your country when you reply . 
   especially if you have weird flair . 
  or no flair . 
  or an eu flag . 
  i think belgium , luxembourg and switzerland are grey because they have such a complicated situation that it would simply be confusing to display them on the map . 
  all three countries are at least tri-lingual and in some cases quadrolingual . 
  you could argue it 's unfair , but i would argue that it would be impossible to make a meaningful map which accommodates switzerland , beligium and luxembourg . 
  even having finland included is a step to far imo . 
  surely you 've had experience of various people being indifferent to the nsa , gchq and the spying ? 
  loads of people are indifferent and many people actually go so far as to that think snowden and manning should be executed . 
  if you read the american press you 'll see evidence of this . 
  you might not agree with it , but the nsa is n't necessarily without popular support . 
  furthermore , whilst a specific issue might not have full democratic support , the government and the actions of government as a whole do . 
  for instance a majority of people disagree with cameron/obama over certain issues , but a majority of people support the government as a whole . 
  a company , on the other hand , does n't even have to do that . 
  the way i 've often described bavaria to my english friends is that it 's the scotland of germany and switzerland is the scotland gone independent/republic of ireland of germany . 
  would you say this is accurate ? 
  i mean , for bavaria , it 's a region with a very distinct dialect ( more distinct than other republic of germany dialects ) like scotland , and has a slightly different political landscape compared to the rest of the country ( bavaria has its own branch of the cdu and scotland has only one tory mp but loads of snp mps ) . 
  additionally glasgow is one of the uk 's largest cities just like m\u00fcnchen is in germany .
