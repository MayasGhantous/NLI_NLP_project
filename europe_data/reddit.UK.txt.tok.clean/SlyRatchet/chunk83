  the eu 's no longer just about economics . 
  you have to have shared values and eu member states are ( mostly ) much more liberal . 
  many would say the values of islam are incompatible with modern western democratic values . 
  and i would agree . 
  ** secondly ** there 's commitment to fulfilling the eu 's membership criteria . 
  turkey has stopped even trying to fulfil it . 
  if you stop fulfilling the membership criteria , you 're definitely not going to be let in . 
  ok the eu has n't been very helpful either but that does n't absolve turkey of severe negligence . 
  if you do n't fulfil the membership criteria then you 're not getting in . 
  ** thirdly ** there 's the stupid issue of geography . 
  i do n't personally care whether you 're in europe or not so long as you 're culturally and politically similar enough . 
  i 'd allow us states to enter so long as they fulfil the criteria . 
  but this is an issue for some people with regards to turkey 's membership but this would definitely not be an issue for ukraine which is firmly inside europe . 
  ** fourth ** the republic of northern cyprus . 
  need i say more ? 
  so long as northern cyprus is there people will think that nc is simply a turkish puppet state which is occupying eu territory . 
  i 'm uncertain who is right and wrong in this issue but as it stands eu heads of state , specifically the greek and republic of cyprus ' heads of state/government see turkey as supporting a state which is occupying eu territory and that simply does not stand . 
  the us would n't allow texas to inter its union if texas was concurrently invading half of oklahoma . 
  ukraine , obviously , has no such issue . 
  so that 's for problems which turkey has , right off the bat , that ukraine does n't . 
  there 's probably also more i 'm forgetting . 
  as you can see , turkey has * a lot * of problems regarding its membership to the eu . 
  ukraine definitely has some , but they 're not nearly this numerous or this problematic . 
  hey , it 's something . 
  would i like snowden to get asylum ? 
  yes . 
  will he ? 
  would i like him to at least get some recognition ? 
  yes . 
  it 's ridiculous that snowden is not capable of getting asylum in the eu , but oh well . 
  that 's the situation we have . 
  it 's good that he 's at least being recognised . 
  the first step to fixing a problem is recognising their is a problem . 
  hopefully if snowden gets this prize heads of state and various electorates will start realising that there is a problem and that this problem should be fixed . 
  whilst i would love this , i think a lot of non british would n't enjoy it anywhere near as much as someone who grew up in england . 
  why the downvotes ? 
  it 's a legitimate guess . 
  belarus is potentially the only country where op 's last point is true . 
  ok i think belarus was n't invaded during wwi or two but there 's no need to downvote . 
  one of the benelux ? 
  they were all invaded during wwi and wwii where as a lot of the eastern countries were invaded before the second world war began or are bigger than romania ( poland ) . 
  furthermore , op mentions `` i am a country of forests and lowlands with a mountainous region . '' . 
  well they do n't call them the low countries for nothing and the netherlands does one area with mountains in the far south . 
  so my bet is on the netherlands . 
  everything outside london . 
  i knew there were a few small deserts in spain , but poland ? 
  that 's a new one . 
   2 ) now recognised as being detrimental to the speed of recovery in post war europe and used as a tool to give the us the ability to put bases in europe . 
  ** ended half a century ago **, 
  hmm , ok , reasonable , there 's half a point here  in addition to the fact that most european countries programs are subsidized by america , and would simply be untenable in america . 
  ok fuck it . 
  i 'm out . 
  you almost had me . 
  i was this close to agreeing with you . 
  did n't switzerland accidentally invade them recently ( 2012/13 ? ), 
  during a training exercise . 
  troops accidentally ventured off course and found themselves in lichtenstein . 
  then promptly retreated, 
  good man . 
  i just ca n't bring myself to part with / r/todayilearned though, 
  kind of off topic , but what does `` dae '' mean ? 
  it 's a response to increasing numbers people ( europeans , american and otherwise ) being overly positive about european in an often assholish way . 
  there 's quite a few people around who 'll tell you how great scandinavia is , or german societal values or the british healthcare system or french food and so on and they do it in a very annoying way . 
  combine this with reddit having a lot of ( american ) people who wo n't hesitate to criticise obama or the us administration and then you see that a lot of americans can feel as though they and their country is constantly being criticised and they see europeans as doing it and therefor retaliate verbally and textually . 
  *** basically : *** some people post `` lol , america sucks '' memes and crap all over reddit because , hey , sometimes the american government does stupid shit . 
  then some people will mention how great * various * european models of democracy , welfare , foreign policy and culture . 
  then the americans who do n't particularly enjoy criticising america feel got at and make memes and and stuff which says `` america good , europe bad '' . 
  people then up vote , et cetera , because they 're tired of all the other anti america , pro europe stuff . 
  i do n't take it personally . 
  i 'd also feel pretty similar to how they feel if europe and america were swapped around . 
  they 're a race and people use that to stereotype them . 
  racism . 
  if it was broader you could use the term xenophobia or something , but the a lot of the anti-roma stuff is kind of basically racism, 
  what are the arguments against fracking ? 
  i 've never really followed it and maybe it 's time to start . 
  well there is solar and hydro and wind power . 
  each european country as enough of these to become sustainable with the right technology , infrastructure and investment . 
  some countries can focus on one source such as solar energy in southern european countries whilst others could focus on two or three like the united kingdom ( wind , water ) or germany ( hydro , wind , solar ) would . 
  some countries might not be capable of being completely self sufficient , but that 's part of the role the eu tries to play with things like the common agricultural policy ( cap ) . 
  the point of the cap is to make europe self sufficient in terms of food production . 
  basically , so that we '' ll never need worry about europe starving because of the situation abroad changing . 
  the same thing would be true with energy . 
  some countries like the uk have a surplus of renewable resources which can then be sold to the rest of europe . 
  it took my one and a half * months * until i happened upon the link to that site . 
  would your experience on / r/mapporn be * in anyway * diminished by there being discussion threads * as well as * normal maps ? 
  loads of people 's experiences of the subreddit would be dramatically increased by allowing discussion threads , including myself . 
  do you want to trawl through wikipedia to enjoy one or two half decent maps or would you like to go to a subreddit and have it all there ? 
  i feel the same way and i always feel the same away about questions regarding maps , both historical and technical . 
  i 'd like to ask you how yuo expect me to ask the question in comments ? 
  do you expect me to just go into a thread and start asking random users `` hey , do you know anything about turning a4 sheets of paper into one large pictures , by any chance ? ... 
  ok , well thanks for responding '' - rinse and repeat . 
  i just think that nobody would lose * anything * if / r/mapporn allowed discussion threads or other content and that loads of people would gain a great deal by allowing discussion threads . 
  therefore , allowing discussion threads is a really good idea . 
  would you lose anything ? 
  would i gain something ? 
  yes . 
  heck , you might even find that you like discussion threads . 
  / rant / / r/mapporn * is * a very specialised subreddit . 
  people who love maps do n't just love them for looking at . 
  they love * understanding * .
