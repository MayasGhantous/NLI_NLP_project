  it 's kind of a message as to what can be achieved if you take the peaceful route instead of the aggressive route . 
  now that is a convincing and logical argument . 
  the spanish government is cutting funding for its healthcare system which is reducing the level of service available ( longer wait times & fewer less skilled workers ) and making patients have to pay the cost which they often do n't . 
  you would n't happen to have any english sources for how much the health budget has been cut ? 
  that would be invaluable , but the argument is still strong without . 
  so we 've established that austerity is probably the cause of lower life expectancy , but now the question because `` is it better than the alternatives ? '' . 
  for me i can only see one alternative which is for the state to continue in the fashion that it was pre-2008 but then we would just end up in the same situation we are in now only worse . 
  the government would eventually run out of money because tax revenue would shrink . 
  then government debt becomes relevant and multiplies the how bad the situation is by halting its lending to spain which means the spanish government would have even less money than it does currently and would have to lay off even more workers and make even deeper cuts than it is currently because it literally does not have the money to pay for it . 
  and ultimately we end up in an even worse situation than we are now . 
  global warming is a new phenomenon . 
  mobile phones are also a new phenomenon . 
  therefor , i conclude that mobile phones caused global warming . 
  ok obviously i 'm not claiming that but i am trying to illustrate what a non sequitur is . 
  ie a conclusion or statement that does not necessarily follow from the previous argument or statement . 
  it 's very easy for a newspaper to say `` look , austerity is happening in spain and the life expectancy has dropped . 
  there must be a connection ! '' . 
  i 'm not saying that mobile phones definitely are not causing global warming or that austerity is n't causing lower life expectancy in spain , but i am saying that you should be sceptical of the evidence . 
  my main beef with the claim in the headline is that it says ' ** austerity ** causes lower life expectancy ' and not ' ** recessions ** cause lower life expectancy ' . 
  oh and i 'd also keep in mind that the title has been editorialised heavily . 
   spain 's life expectancy falls by between two and three months for the first time ever ( in recorded history , that is . 
  austerity at work is wonderful , the poor were living too much it seems ) - op ***  a reduction in life expectancy has never happened before in spain , except in 1998 when a brief drop for women from 82 years to 81 years and six months occurred , although the male life expectancy of 74 years and six months was not affected.-thinkspain . com and this is thinkspain 's actual headline  spain 's life expectancy falls by between two and three months for the first time ever it does a decent job at explaining the relationship between recession and and life expectancy and that recession is the ultimate term . 
  it even says this explicitly `` added money worries , stress and unemployment which may lead to retirees being forced to feed and house their adult children , together with pension and healthcare funding cuts , among other ** recession ** - related problems , are leading to a lesser quality of mental and physical health across the board , says the ine . 
  most of europe 's way of dealing with the recession is to have austerity . 
  by that logic , austerity is actually helping raise life expectancy by putting an end to the problem . 
  the * real * argument here should be whether or not it does that . 
  not misleading headlines . 
  make the argument , do n't just use non sequiturs and misleading headlines . 
  it 's also worth noting that you can change another parameter directly .

  thanks , it 's been fixed, 
  interestingly this is how they do it in [ wales ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/road_signs_in_wales ) . 
  i 've never heard anyone complain , but then welsh nationalism is n't extremely pervasive or strong compared to that of various other regions around europe like scotland , catalonia , sicily and maybe south tyrol . 
  would be interested to hear how some other regions treat this dual language typed situation . 
  just to add some perspective [ this chart ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10613201 ) shows how much the uk economy has grown or contracted in each quarter of the year since 1990 ] . 
  and [ this chart ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00115 ) displays the growth rate of various european ( plus japan and usa ) countries and the eu 27 , eu 28 averages but on * yearly * basis instead of quarter yearly basis . 
  if the oecd 's prediction is correct , that would make us one of the fastest growing eu economies in 2013 . 
  romania , lithuania , latvia and estonia are the only which i can see that are * predicted * to have a higher growth rate than the uk 's 1.5 % . 
  according to eurostat anyway . 
  sweden does come up equal to us though and most non eu countries on the list come up ahead in terms of the estimates and if you look at the some of the countries which were in recession during 2008 on the list they made equally impressive recoveries ( finland went from -8.5 % to +3.4 % , for instance ) . 
  i think his is a really good * optional * thing . 
  maybe post it in the description of the thread when it comes around with a little message saying it would be awesome for people to use . 
  but the overall discussion should be in text format because this is reddit and text based discussions is what it is built for and what it does well . 
  not to mention all the inherent problems with having a audio based discussion such as people being in environments where they need to be quiet like work or people not having microphones . 
  if people start using this more then that 's fantastic , but if they do n't and they contribute via text that 's also fantastic . 
  it 's in two continents . 
  the fact that russia is also an asian country does not cancel out it being european . 
  spain is in two continents as well . 
  the bit of it which is in africa does n't cancel out it being european . 
  russia is arguably much more european than asian given that the overwhelming majority of its population is on the european continent . 
  the anthem of the european union http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fba8ptx0fve ( the full song is much better with the build up and everything , but you get the idea ), 
  this was pretty much my feeling too . 
  i 've never found watching sports particularly interesting but my whole family turned out to watch the opening ceremony and it was quite good . 
  i always found myself watching a couple of the events because i had nothing better to do and being proud about our medal tally . 
  it was a lot more than i was expecting . 
  the golden letter box thing was great as well ( but then i do live in sheffield , so i would say that ) . 
  and i also do n't think there 'll be any long lasting effects apart from maybe some investment in infrastructure . 
  the olympics came and went and they 're a nice memory and something to be proud of . 
  they wont propel us to even greater heights . 
  i 'm glad we had them and i 'd be happy to ` waste ' some of our tax money on it in future because i enjoyed it that much . 
  for countries who are n't so affluent at the moment , i 'd probably feel differently . 
  but we were doing ok economically and continued to do so . 
  oh fair enough, 
   you 'll often find american ( ** with a lot of exceptions ** ) ... 
  what i 'm wondering is why he stole two other people 's remote controls . 
  what the fuck is he going to do with a tv in someone else 's house ? 
  ^ `` controls ^ 2 ^ others '', 
  i think my problem with american city blocks as opposed to barcelona 's is that with barcelona a lot more care seems to have gone into each building and a lot of care has gone into making sure the building 's all look good together with a coherent style . 
  on top of this most european cities are extremely densely build with small and often winding roads in american cities each building can often end up looking a bit cheap . 
  that 's not to say they are cheap , but plasterboard housing instead of brick is n't a great style and the monuments of glass look good as free standing structures but they do n't look so good as part of a collective whole . 
  you 'll often find american ( with a lot of exceptions ) have great big highways and huge green lawns which give the place quite an empty feel compared to european counter parts . 
  that 's my analysis anyway . 
  i 'm no expert and it mind just be blind nationalism , but if i had to try and put my finger on it , that 's where i would put my fingers . 
  it was already posted there . 
  this is probably a cross post from there, 
  their job requires that they make conclusions based on decisive evidence . 
  that alone puts them above your average politician . 
  additionally they 've probably not been corrupted and retain their financial independence so probably will remain that way . 
  well it 's at least more likely that 's the case than for a career politician . 
  `` every little helps '' - tesco, 
  just out of curiosity , where did the 10 % figure come from ? 
  then do n't come here ? 
  that 's my response to the sun anyway . 
  eh , most anti-immigration people are n't so much against immigration because of bnp-ish reasons like `` ooh they 're coming here and destroying our culture '' or whatever . 
  they 're worried about jobs . 
  they 're not actually racists they just feel like the system is being gamed by other people and is thus making the system even worse for them and their families . 
  usually little englanders also are n't actually worried about themselves but about their children who 're entering the job market and/or having difficulties . 
  tl ; dr those guys are n't nearly as bad as you might think . 
  it 's not got a lot to do with race , ( but it might ) . 
  you do realise that i never said that i think we should invade syria ? 
  you 'll notice i took pretty much no political stance . 
  all i said were the reasons for chemical weapons being treated the way they are treated .
