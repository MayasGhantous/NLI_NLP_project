  however , in continental europe , these projects were usually built over time . ], 
  in the us , it is quite apparent that you have the means to do it , given spending on foreign wars under the ruse of ` securing american interests ' . 
  why is helping the poor not seen as a better way of serving american interests ? 
  in european countries , that is exactly how it is seen , which is why we spend more on healthcare as a proportion of gdp than on defence ( to which the us government continually berates us for , not that we care/listen ) . 
  so there 's definitely reasons why the us is generally against socialised healthcare , but if the us had the same mind set as europeans , or to an extent canadians , then those reasons would seem insignificant . 
  i think * ostensibly * americans and canadians are very similar , but then germans , brits , francs , spaniards , and poles are all * ostensibly * very different , but polling has actually indicated that culturally our attitudes towards things are quite similar . 
  i think it 's the same situation with canada and america , where a lot of the superficial stuff is similar , but underneath you 're both quite different . 
  the elephant in the room is healthcare . 
  from what i understand , ` obamacare ' is seen as extremely controversial , is facing legal challenges and does n't even come close to the kind of stuff that most european countries and canada have . 
  in the eu and canada obamacare would be seen as an * addition * to whatever social legislation is already in place , rather than a centre piece . 
  this is because canada follows the form of liberalism ( nb : pretty much all members of the western world follow * some * form of liberalism ) that most european states follow , which is ` progressive ' or ` social liberalism ' which attempts to enhance individuals ' freedom by ensuring that all people have access to education and are never forced into anything * by economic forces * . 
  in america , they tends to follow the ` laissez faires ' , ` classical liberal ' model whereby most forms of government intervention are seen as restrictions on individual liberty ( e.g. 
  taxation ) . 
  and this is furthered in other areas which have less to do with canada 's social liberalism , such as foreign military interventions ( notably refusing to participate in iraq in 2003 , similar to most europeans excluding the uk ) and foreign policy ( canada having full relations with cuba , despite strong american resistance ) . 
  canada is also members of several organisations which help maintain and develop links with her european allies , notably la francophonie and the commonwealth . 
  canada even helps fund a small portion of the european space agency 's budget . 
  so , despite both america and canada being stereotyped as large , and geographically diverse countries which enjoy hunting , shooting , watching a game of hockey or ` football ' and eating some deliciously greasy foods , there 's more fundamental and underlying differences which ( i think ) are the ones that actually matter and it 's these differences between the usa and canada which do n't exist between canada and the eu , or at least in far smaller quantities . 
  that 's why canada would make a good addition to the european union , but the usa would not . 
  xenophobia in hong kong ? 
  i know they have their streaks , but everything i 've read seems to suggest they are just as tolerant as most europeans . 
  they 're also extremely open to immigration , but then i 'm only comparing that to south east asia , rather than europe . 
  even so , something could be worked out to control desire for immigration , such as housing regulations . 
  additionally , we could always start a war with china and get some of that sweet sweet land & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
   plus a return ticket is super expensive . 
  all the more reason for them to join the eu and help fund our space programme ( which , btw [ is the third best funded in the world already and arguably second or first ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_government_space_agencies#budgets ) if you include the funding and capabilities of other national organisations which run a long side it like uksa , fsp , gac ), 
  eu is the definitely the largest economy , but not by much . 
  with the eu 's poor growth statistics in mind , we 'll actually be over taken by the us again in a couple of years , assuming china does n't overtake us first ( which it already has , by if measured using ppp ) . 
  but then hopefully we 'll win that accolade back through market reforms , the economic boom which will take place when the labour reforms ( esp . 
  in southern europe ) kick in and potentially through incorporation of new member states ( although it 's unlikely that we 'll get any new members in the next five years , because junker anounced a moratorium on enlargement , but we 'll probably still be making progress on getting other states up to eu standards whilst he 's in office ) . 
  ** anyway ** so the difference between the us and eu in terms of gdp size is not enough to seriously reorientate canada just because we passed a trade deal . 
  it would take more of a political will for something like that to happen . 
  yes we do . 
  the queen always goes out to watch the match when chelsea 's playing and usually gets so hammered that she invites the ` ole stadium back to her place . 
  fortunately she 's got a house big enough , otherwise shed have had to embarrass herself and turn a few of them away at the door by now . 
  nice lass is our lizzy . 
  whenever i 'm talking to a german about the stereotypes of their country they will always tell me , without fail ( so far ) , that they are untrue . 
  they will tell me how they do n't unquestioningly obey the red light/ample man , the trains are n't that punctual , germans are not hard working , germans are not attentive drivers . 
  but then whenever you tell them about how things work in other countries for comparison they 'll respond by saying that that country is somehow an outlayer and that somehow the rest of the world is better than them and refuse to accept that their train/work ethic/driving/whatever just is * relatively * good . 
  all of this further proves the german stereotypes of mild pessimism and perfectionism, 
  maybe it 's like a batman and joker thing ? 
  they both need each other . 
  for those wondering , as i was , ` chomage ' means ` unemployment ' . 
  yeah , salmond 's more like a saint or a prophet over there , rather than a full on god . 
  or at least he was . 
  the place seems to be quite filled with pretty reconciliatory posts now , which are looking forward to devolution rather than crying . 
   this concept of responsibility connected to political culture is foreign to me . 
  here , even a prison sentence is not enough to keep them out of the parliament . 
  do n't your heads of political parties usually stand down if they lose an important election referendum ? 
  i know here in the uk it is a tradition/convention in all the political parties to have the party leader stand down if they lose a general election , because that candidate is seen to ` have had their chance ' and they should ` make way for a new approach ' ( and because their parties ' will usually force them out if they do n't resign ) . 
  is this not the case elsewhere in europe ? 
  it 's very rare for former westminster heavy weights to do much of anything of political interest after their time in westminster has ended . 
  i mean , normally uk prime ministers get a default lordship and spend the rest of their days being quite and enjoying a nice life . 
  blair and brown are a bit special , in that blair went off to start some weird consulting company and become a sort of envoy for the middle east to an international organisation and brown decided to remain an mp . 
  most pms before that ( major and thatcher , for instance ) became lords . 
  additionally , most of the mps who * do n't * become pms often like to stick around in the house of commons and do their political duties their . 
  tony benn is a great example because hs joined in the 1960s and stayed remained an mp ( apart from a brief period where he was forced to be a lord ) until he died . 
  dennis skinner is the same . 
  i think both of these people also used to have pretty senior ministerial roles , but did n't mind being back bench mps either . 
  so if you 've had a senior role in the uk government but you want to continue your political career , you 're likely to want to continue that career at westminster as a backbencher or as a lord . 
  ** however ** the times are very much changing . 
  the scottish parliament has only been around for ten years and is attracting a lot of prestige and soon will attract even more power . 
  additionally , the eu is also looking increasingly enticing to former * even current * heads of government . 
  i mean , blair actually tried to get herman van rompuy 's ( soon to be tusk 's ) job as the head of the european council . 
  and poland 's current prime minister has given up his job as pm to become the president of the european council . 
  additionally , van rompuy was also a former prime minister ( of belgium ) and the incoming european commission chief ( junker ) is the former prime minister of luxembourg . 
  the soon to be replaced commission president ( borroso ) also used to be prime minister of portugal and iirc he actually gave up that job ( after serving only two years ) to become commission president . 
  so there 's certainly an appetite among increasingly large and influential european states for their leaders to give up their current jobs in favour of an ostensible ` promotion ' to a senior european union position ( tusk 's party [ civic platform ] got a big surge in support when their pm accepted his new role ) . 
  and this is not strictly limited to continental europeans . 
  catherine ashton was a member of the house of lords put was appointed by blair to become the european union 's effective foreigner secretary . 
  so i think we could see a lot more senior british politicians , especially next time a labour ( who are significantly more pro-europe than the tories ) government gets into power . 
  however , i think interest in scotland from politicians who 've had a good run in westminster will be more limited . 
  we will still see more interest in scotland by influential current politicians , but it wont attract ` experience ' politicians in the same way other institutions , like the eu do and do increasingly . 
  but it 's a great time to be a live !, 
  if only to watch as the nature of the various european democracies evolve and how ` european democracy ' and politics at large evolves . 
  he could become an ` elder statesman ' like brown has . 
  we could use a few more of those . 
  merci beaucoup , 
  maybe, 
  can we get a source on this ? 
   but i 'm not talking about 3rd world hell holes here i do n't know about anyone else here , but ever since they started only taking the bins away every * two * weeks instead of one , it 's been like living in the third world !, 
  * grumble grumble * who knows what they 'll do next ? 
  yes , virtually everyone speaks english , especially if you go to a touristy area . 
  i actually surprised myself by * not * being surprised by russia . 
  i can totally understand why a lot of people would want to visit there . 
  it has a very long and interesting history and a very distinct culture , even compared to other european nations . 
  the architecture is also wonderfully varied . 
  it also does conjure up somewhat of a romantic vision , i think . 
  i mean , when i think of russia i think of putin , crimea and homophobia , but i also think of how pretty the kremlin is , how awesome leningrad looks , i think of how alien cyrillic looks , the tzars , october revolution , pulling strings in the cuban missile crisis and all of these mysterious events . 
  it 's not hard to conjure up a romantic image of russia . 
  do n't be so hard on belgium . 
  there 's that peeing baby thing . 
  but , to be a smidgen more serious , ( though only a smidgen ) there are a lot of really great tourist attractions in the lowlands which i think would put them on par with all of the other great tourist areas . 
  i mean , bruxelles and amsterdam are absolutely * gorgeous * !, 
  they 're not just quite nice looking , but they are some of the most architecturally pleasing cities i know of . 
  and the funky borders are an attraction in and of themselves . 
  and let 's not forget that luxembourg is literally a un world heritage site ( but then , so is bath , so maybe i 'm overstating things ? ) . 
  i also think the food is actually pretty incredible too . 
  there 's an excellent mix between the german 's culture of gianormous portions of delicious meats and breads but also the slightly more minimalist french styles . 
  the belgian frites/pommes and waffles are great examples of this , in my opinion . 
  this all goes without addressing the elephant in the room that is the netherlands ' drugs policy .
