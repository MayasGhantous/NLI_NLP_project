  so really what i 'm doing here is combing two lists . 
  one list is about more traditional ideas of beauty . 
  that 's the list with athens , paris and rome . 
  and then there 's the other list which is a lot less about being polished and more about being industrious but in a stylish and cool way . 
  personally i feel edinburgh does that better than paris does what it does . 
  well the [ human development index ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) says otherwise . 
  as does the [ gini coefficient ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:gini_retouched_legend.gif ) when it is combined with [ gdp per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:bnp_perhoofd_2012.png ), 
   russian language used more widely than ukrainian i 'm not sure this is correct . 
  according to the 2001 census , 67.5 percent of the population declared ukrainian as their native language and 29.6 percent declared russian . 
  [ source ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20080105092304/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/ ), 
  i think entering the eu is n't the end of the reforming process . 
  countries can still reform after they 've joined , and often that sort of thing plays well with the electorate which means reforms will continue . 
  i mean , once you 're in the eu the government becomes a lot more comparable to other countries . 
  croatia , for example , is now compared to germany in terms of democracy and so on . 
  of course this does n't always play particularly well with the electorate , as italy and spain have demonstrated . 
  other issues seem to take precedent . 
  it would be rather nice if the eu had an organisation for exposing corruption or something . 
  you know , it has all the appropriate equipment : courts , civil servants , law which supersedes national law , money , an ability to persecute member states . 
  it 's the kind of thing they 'd be good at , and it might even help with the eu 's image problem . 
  reminds me of the 30 million gypsies which will move to the uk from romania and bulgaria if they ever join schengen . 
  you know , more people than actually live in those countries combined . 
  just in case anyone has n't read the article here 's something important  copenhagen - ** when voters head to the polls ** to elect denmark 's 13 meps in may next year ** they may also be asked to ** *** delete *** ** two danish eu treaty opt-outs ** and to approve the kingdom 's participation in the european patent court in a referendum . 
   the leader of the liberal party and former danish prime minister , lars lokke rasmussen , ** will propose ** in a speech on monday ( 12 august ) in norway ** that the danes should remove opt-outs ** on eu defence and justice co-operation that were introduced almost 20 years ago the eu referendum is ** not ** about whether denmark should be in the eu or not . 
  the referendum is about whether denmark should integrate further , or not . 
  i 'm only pointing this out because i know a lot of people only read headlines and then head straight to the thread . 
  on this occasion it could lead to getting * massively * the wrong idea . 
  i think they do believe in self determination , they just think that territorial integrity trumps it . 
  whenever i hear about prince philip being in hospital or prince harry going to afghanistan , it still never makes it feel like the royals actually live in the same world as me . 
  it always very unextraordinary . 
  but this feels different . 
  this feels very unplanned , very unprepared for and unforeseen . 
  if beatrix or elizabeth were to die now , it would n't be particularly surprising . 
  it would be sad but it would n't be shocking . 
  having an elder die is something that we 'll all have to experience . 
  but having your 44 year old son die ? 
  or your 44 year old brother ? 
  to have him go on holiday one day and be in a coma the next ? 
  that 's something that most families in the netherlands or most other western countries will never have to experience . 
  it makes you realise that we 're all mortals ; that even royals can have some of the worst tragedies happen to them . 
  even if you 're a celebrity or a prince you could still find yourself in a coma with your lifespan cut in half and your family left to grieve the loss . 
  it makes you realise that they must be human too . 
  and they must live in the same world as me . 
  not in some parallel universe of endless luxury and padded corners . 
  i suppose this is how people who are old enough to remember diana must feel . 
  a touch\u00e9 . 
  i tend to lump overseas territories mentally into one group which is not protected by nato but then forget that a couple of uk territories are in europe . 
  it 's kind of a simple mistake to make, 
  it should be noted that that clause was included specifically to stop france and the united kingdom from using nato to defend their colonies . 
  obviously the falklands , gibraltar and the rest of the overseas territories and dep\u00e1rtments are the remnants of that and so are the exact thing that clause/article is trying to ensure nato is n't forced to protect . 
  it 's an interesting situation . 
  just thought i should expand your list on further . 
  a ukiper might also think that the eu restricts economic growth in certain ways and also restricts our freedoms . 
  for instance they would argue that the eu dictates that we must accept economic migrants from all over europe and not accept other kinds of migrants from other areas which we might want to . 
  and is therefor a restriction on our freedom . 
  additionally they argue that to protect the free market we 're not allowed to pursue more favourable trade deals with other , developing , countries because that would affect the common market as a whole in a negative way but not the united kingdom , specifically , in a negative way . 
  so that 's bad for freedom and economic growth also . 
  personally i think these arguments do n't amount to much because the benefits of being in the european union and losing such freedoms far outweigh having these freedoms . 
  last thing @ggow , thanks for portraying eurosceptic views . 
  even if they 're not your personal views it 's good that they are being aired . 
  usually this place can end up being a bit na\u00efve about the ukip position and just assume it 's bad without understanding . 
  both sides should be understood . 
  i like to think that the pro europe side of the debate can win without having to resort misunderstanding the facts . 
  so yeah , thanks for doing that . 
  i 'm not so sure it would have such a difference though . 
  if i was to distill your comment down to two points they would be * adds balance to what is a mostly english country and * would make secession seem more feasible . 
  for the first one i do n't think it would make much difference because england already makes up 50 million of the uk 's sixty million population . 
  that 's 83 percent of the total population . 
  if scotland left then there would be about 55 million people in the uk but it would n't change much . 
  wales , scotland and ni already are make up a minority of the uk population and scotland leaving would n't change that . 
  the labour and lib dems would have to become a bit more right wing , yes , but it still would n't change that much and i think people would quickly get used to it . 
  sure they would n't be quite as happy , but the difference is negligible . 
  secondly i , as for part of the uk becoming independent and that proving that it can be done , i think that 's not really something which needs to be proved . 
  we need only look at the republic of ireland to see how it might turn out and realise that it went alright . 
  could be better , could be worse . 
  i 'm not trying to undermine your points completely . 
  you 've definitely got a point . 
  it would spur welsh nationalism and perhaps calls for independence , but i think that if we look at it historically that not much which is new would actually happen . 
  it would be a predominantly english country before and after and there have been parts of the uk which seceded before . 
  it 's nothing particularly new . 
  it would n't be some new catalyst for change . 
  it would be a nudge for independence movements . 
  but it would n't be a shove . 
  i 'd love to see one of our politicians do that . 
  it seems like a great way to have a civil conversation about party political issues . 
  you know , everyone remains civil and it 's a conversation mostly driven by the passengers ' interests rather than one side trying to ram an opinion down your throat like you see on tv . 
  well , this is assuming that our politicians do it as well as this guy did . 
  it 'd be nice if they at least tried something like it though, 
  there is some ambiguity about whether we 'd be able to work abroad though . 
  we 'd definitely be able to go as tourists very easily , like we can in 170 other countries , but there is some uncertainty about whether we would be able to work in the eu without a work permit . 
  i mean , we ca n't just turn up and work on arrival in those other 170 countries you mentioned , but we can turn up and be tourists . 
  i was reading the ukip website a few days ago and it said something * like * this `` eu nationals who have been working in the uk for more than 7 years without a work permit will be able to apply to stay in the uk '' . 
  from that you can deduce that europeans who 've not been working in the uk for 7 years will be forced to return home and that these actions would be reciprocated by the european union . 
  but this is simply party policy and has the potential to change . 
  iirc switzerland is part of the schengen area but not part of the free trade area which means thats there 's no border protection and people can move freely into switzerland as tourists , but they ca n't work or settle down or anything like that . 
  the only way i see that counter argument working is if the people living on gibraltar and the falklands are first generation colonists , which they are not . 
  the over whelming majority of people who live on the falklands and gibraltar were born there and so were there parents . 
  why should they have to move ? 
  why should they have to fall under the jurisdiction of a government they do n't want ? 
  you can go on all day about who it 's unfair on spain , but does it really hurt spain so much ? 
  i mean , they 've had no jurisdiction over this area for hundreds of years .
