  the people who live their have been british for hundreds of years . 
  surely it would be more unfair on the people who were born there , grew up there and who live there than it would be to spain to deny them ownership of same thing . 
  the exact same goes for argentina . 
  does spain or argentina have any real right to these places ? 
  think about it , what good reason is there ? 
  the people who live there do n't want it . 
  but people somewhere else so that there opinion does n't matter . 
  surely that 's a more colonial point of view ? 
  what happened in the past happened in the past . 
  the damage is done and the people who live there , live there . 
  you ca n't make all the spanish people who moved to mexico and argentina move back now . 
  the argentines and mexicans who lived there now played no part in the colonisation of those places . 
  it 's their home now . 
  they grew up there . 
  it would be unfair on the mexicans and the argentinians to move them now because they never did anything wrong apart from have the lack of foresight to be born in land that used to belong to someone else . 
  you can rely on spain or argentina to bring up the falklands/gibraltar issue on a regular basis . 
  all the guys at whitehall have to do is figure out how frequently they bring it up and then schedule deployers also on a regular basis . 
  that way , you can usually rely on a destroyer to be heading into the area whenever either of them brings up the issue . 
  i 'm all for the uk to reduce its defence spending , but this is certainly one of the benefits of having high defence spending . 
   i was actually thinking of trying to set-up some ama 's myself i was wondering what sort of people you had in mind ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  we seldom get any `` coloniser guilt '' stuff in the british media . 
  if anything it 's depicted quite favourably . 
  i mean , most people acknowledge that it was n't exactly a good thing but nobody really feels bad about it . 
  it 's just interesting that france would take a severely different tone . 
  i 've never heard this phrase before . 
  i 'm going to try to make it catch on in the hope that britain becomes more european . 
  and because it 's a really good word , obviously . 
  well [ this thing ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/barcelona_iglesia_sagrada_familia.jpg ) immediately came to mind . 
  or / r/de , it 's not a germany specific sub but does have a much larger following and might be receptive to this sort of thing . 
  what city ? 
  maybe we can think of something, 
  if it had n't been in rijeka , it would only have been somewhere else, 
   why on earth have i not been to aberdeen just think on it . 
  we all know why . 
  i thought the titanic was belfast ? 
  as a fellow sheffielder , you 're forgetting our other great gift to the world , nick clegg . 
  how you fix it is very much a matter of personal preference . 
  in fact the entire process of tea making is something which every one thinks they are doing the right way and will disagree vehemently when some one implies that any other way is better/just as good . 
  personally i put in my tea bag and two sugar ( cubes are the norm in my house ) , then hot water , and then milk , then squeeze the tea bag and drink . 
  however the rest of my family have no sugar or , when they 're feeling frivolous , one sugar . 
  but some of my mother 's friends take theirs with no milk or sugar . 
  and then there 's all the different kinds of tea . 
  i go for just plain old boring tea like the own brand stuff * of a nice supermarket * . 
  but lots of other people will go for things like decaffeinated or herbal teas or ones with fancy names . 
  earl grey is apparently a very popular kind , but i have n't tried it myself . 
  i think that the way the rest of my family does it is the most common way to do it ( normal-ish tea bag , milk , no sugar ) but anyway is ok really . 
  we wont judge you , so long as you acknowledge that the host 's way of doing tea is obviously superior , but he or she will almost certainly accommodate your preference . 
  i had no idea that tea was this complex before i started writing . 
  it 's pretty funny how much long the german language version of the currywurst page is http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/currywurst, 
  to those who 're saying `` yes '' what do you plan to ask him ? 
  hmm , there 's roast dinners and the like , but that 's about it . 
  it 's just pretty boring . 
  every real kind of food which we do is done somewhere else , but better . 
  so we adopted their ways of doing it . 
  that 's why chicken tikka masala is the country 's most popular dish . 
  it 's just better than what we could do . 
  so i guess fish and chips is pretty much the only real thing which lasted in terms of filling food that you might have for a meal . 
  it 's not so much about them being popular it 's more about them being consistently enjoyed everywhere . 
  most of the time most people are kind of indifferent to fish and chips , me included . 
  but sometimes you just really really want fish and chips and they are the only thing which will hit the post just right . 
  at that moment they are simply delicious and deserve every bit of hype they get . 
  i 'm not sure how much hype they get abroad . 
  it probably a lot more hype than they get here . 
  but however much hype that is , they deserve it for those few moments where they just hit the spot . 
  you 'd be surprised how much good food america has . 
  i mean , i put a good amount of time into thinking about all the various british foods and got at about four different things . 
  i doubt you 'll be able to find something which * every * american eats just like it 'd be impossible to find something which every european eats but you 'd be able to find it on at least a state level and maybe even a regional level ( east coast , west coast , mid-central , south , ect ) . 
  to be fair , i would put a ** good ** burger as a good american food . 
  my brother and sister have been to the states and the american burgers are just better . 
  as is a lot of the other food like fried chicken and pancakes . 
  on top of that there 's surely foods like apple pie and various thanks givings typed foods . 
  basically , yeah , you have good food . 
  it might not be healthy , but do n't try and say it 's not tasty . 
  potatoes ? 
  i mean , so long as they 're growing ok ... ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  [ how could i forget ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/0462c731144c20a3ea923012e6b49d3b/tumblr_mqmztxxppp1rzwv55o1_500.png ), 
  [ exhibit a ] ( http://www.fishandchipsplymouth.co.uk/communities/6/004/010/964/386/images/4575366028.jpg ) . 
  the sort of thing you might treat yourself to every few weeks . 
  not quite everyday typed food and not quite special occasion food either . 
  it 's somewhere in between . 
  [ exhibit b ] ( http://blackgirlsguidetoweightloss.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/white-pasta.jpg ) and [ exhibit b. 2 ] ( http://jonoandjules.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/blue-cheese-pasta.jpg ) but it seldom looks anywhere near as appetising as this . 
  it 's more of a eat at home because you ca n't be bothered to cook anything more exotic , typed food . 
  [ exhibit c ] ( http://www.wyndhamgrandlondon.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/best-curry-brick-lane-wyndham-grand.jpg ) now this is definitely special occasion food . 
  you can have it delivered or eat out . 
  either is completely appropriate and quite lovely . 
  interestingly , all of these meals can be either vegetarian or carnivorous . 
  both ways are quite tasty . 
  i went to the netherlands once . 
  the most dutch food i found the entire time was in a belgian waffle shop . 
  to be fair the british houses are usually * a bit * nicer than that, 
  you ai n't seen nothing yet, 
  do you even have a visa which will let you work ? 
  earlier is probably better . 
  the thread will stay active well into the day and usually until people start going to bed , so if you start it later in the day you 're just depriving people in eastern europe of some time they could potentially spend on the thread . 
  when when i was the one who regularly started the thread i aimed for 10 am gmt/bst, 
  the only thing i 'm saying is the opposite of what you said and nothing more . 
   right but the comparison is n't really fair . 
  we worked hard to achieve this . 
  i think all civilisations worked hard to achieve what they achieved , but the europeans weren the first to industrialise and the first to invent the maxim machine gun and thus all of the hard work the other civilisations have put in over the years was wiped out .
