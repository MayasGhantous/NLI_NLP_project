  do n't just say `` you 're wrong . '', 
  and then move on . 
  all it does is make you look like an insulting twazzak and make the person you said it too feel got at because that 's exactly what you did . 
  you can have your condescending opinion , but you at least need to explain yourself . 
  say something constructive . 
  it 's even worse when people use the bloody meme a long with it . 
  / rant end, 
  i love that this is probably going to become one of the main pro eu arguments . 
  it 's just so hilariously mundane compared to all the other arguments . 
  i mean , euroskeptics are always going on about `` national sovereignty !, 
  it 's a state 's right to decide its own affairs ! '', 
  and eurofederalists talk about `` if we stand united we can retain a prominent place in world affairs and stand up to the likes of china and america ! '', 
  but the argument that 's probably really going to make people go one way or the other is `` who 's fault is it that you can travel to spain , finland and greece without having to pay any extra at all for your mobile data , text messaging and calling ? '', 
  it 's always bread and butter arguments which make people vote one way or the other . 
  you can argue about the inherent problems with a currency union or the boom and bust nature of globalised capitalism until the tides roll in , but when it comes down to it bread and butter is what matters to people . 
  it 's the mundane but practical that decides it . 
  you mean like a cartel ? 
   lukashenko , although deemed a dictator , says a lot of right things . 
  have no idea how awful or good he actually is . 
  awesome moustache . 
  you do n't have to be left wing to be a dictator . 
  in fact dictators can be anywhere on the political spectrum , but they tend to be either on the extreme left ( stalin , mao ) or extreme right ( hitler and other fascists ) . 
  a more precise definition of the word `` dictator '' for those interested , as defined by the oxford american dictionary . 
   `` a ruler with total power over a country , typically one who has obtained power by force . '', 
  on top of that * generally * dictators have acquired their power through force and have no democratic legitimacy . 
  this is part of the reasons for their being other useful terms like autocrat . 
  at the time this video was released there was only one former yugoslav country in the eu and there was little prospect of any others joining in the near future and the economist 's main focus is on eu matters . 
  should it be that way ? 
  well that 's another question but that seems to be where their priorities are . 
  this coming from the president of the country which benefits greatly from the eu 's more wasteful facets like the strasbourg parliament or cap and has continually blocked treaty change . 
  heck france actually pays stupid money to the uk to avoid cap reform so that france can get even more stupid money because of it . 
  uhg . 
  herein lays a problem . 
  yeah i love the idea and personally i agree that getting a train to china would be awesome , but it 's just not economically viable . 
  it would be a lot cooler as an experience to take a train to beijing from moscow , but not that many people would make the trip because most people going to beijing are doing it for business reasons and therefor need to take the cheapest and quickest route which would be by air . 
  even a lot of tourists would probably opt for air because it would be cheaper and would rather spend time in the country rather than on the train . 
  there 's just too little benefit from making this sort of a train link . 
  however , they are definitely exciting . 
  personally i do prefer the gibraltar tunnel/bridge though or the siberian bridge idea . 
  it 's unlikely that snowden will get the peace prize this year because nominations normally beed to be made by [ february ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nobel_peace_prize#nomination_and_selection ) and snowden make his leak roughly on [ 20 may ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_snowden#media_disclosures ) . 
  so he probably wont get it this year ( though they might make an exception , which is unlikely ) but this means there 's nothing stopping him from getting it next year . 
  btw the nobel peace prize winner is announced on the 10th of december . 
  the thing is , would you want to ride a train for 25 hours or 7 hours 40 minutes by plane ( not including check in ) ? 
  even with check in times i 'd probably go with the plane . 
  it 's a real challenge to make trains competitive against planes over long distances . 
  even over relatively short distances like glasgow to london planes can be both more cost efficient and time efficient ( note `` can '' , does n't mean they actually are ) . 
  i think the highspeed train line would be more for tourism and transporting people rather than transporting freight . 
  ok , you probably would n't travel the whole way to china from hamburg by train , but you might travel part of the way . 
  personally i 'd prefer local high speed projects to be finished first though . 
  and then maybe make some other highspeed projects and finish those too . 
  and then in the year 2177 we can build some europe to china high speed link . 
  maybe . 
   2nd generation immigrants count as native britons do n't they ? 
  some of the more right wing parts of british politics would argue with you about that . 
   `` bloated and incredibly wasteful '' . 
  i would ask you for sources . 
  i very much doubt this is true . 
  the eu commission , dislike it as much as you want , works with top-educated people . 
  they do n't just take anyone . 
  compared to many national civil administrations it 's elitist and lean . 
  just thought i 'd provide some statistics . 
  the eu has a ~ 30,000 civil servants compared to the uk 's ~ 500,000 civil servants . 
  the eu budget makes up about 1 % of the gdp where as national budgets are all in the region of 40 % to 60 % of gdp . 
  imo this leads to the eu trying to get a lot more bang for its buck ( or euro ) than national governments and it does a relatively good job at this . 
  however there are a couple of examples which eurosceptics will pick on such as the strasbourg parliament and the common agricultural policy . 
  the problem with these is that national governments are ** much ** more wasteful than this and the only reason we know about it is because of a eurosceptic press . 
  look , i put too much emphasis into that sentence and not enough ambiguity . 
  i did n't intend it as `` germany ** is ** changing its ways '' but rather `` germany is possibly , maybe changing its ways and we should accept the possibility that that is maybe what is happening and not judge until we know '' . 
  it 's too early to tell either way . 
  it 's not like all governments are the same . 
  obama , and cameron and merkel all have their own three strikes . 
  i 'd say obama 's used at least one of them . 
  i do n't assign my chances to `` the system '' . 
  it 's not like the chances given to market thatcher 's government are counted towards david cameron 's . 
  how many chances have you given them so far ? 
  i 'd say obama 's down one strike ( so far ) and bush is down two . 
  one for iraq ( along with t. blair ) and one for continuing the prism . 
  i 'm not sure how long prism has been going on for and to what extent . 
  all governments which participated get some of a strike depending on how much they knew and how much they were involved . 
  uk prime ministers definitely come under fire for this but not so much merkel . 
  there could be things we do n't know yet , but it seems like this may have been mostly going on without direct oversight from the german government . 
  but i have n't read all the facts and all the facts are n't available . 
  ( keep in mind * facts * and not speculation or hypothesise ) . 
  so basically , a government would need to be pretty bad for me to lose all respect in them . 
  most people are somewhat keyed into american news as well . 
  who is n't ? 
  so they 'll have some idea what 's going on in the usa as regards this sort of stuff . 
  sure it does n't get posted here , but when my weekly porn magazine ( big british b * tches ) gets delivered it does n't say anything about who the prime minister of the united kingdom is , but i 'm fairly sure every one who reads that magazine knows who the prime minister is . 
  ok some of them might not , but those people a minority and if the magazine was more high brow i 'd expect the people reading it to be at least slightly more intelligent as well as more aware of things which the magazine does not talk about . 
  let 's give them a chance to prove that they 're trying to do something good before we start criticising them for doing nothing , eh ? 
  it 's probably because the pictures kept showing heads of state like nicolas sarkozy who is n't a member of parliament . 
  additionally all the pictures showed the highest ranking member of government like angela merkel and david cameron instead of normal mps with base salaries . 
  well yeah , but now germany 's trying to stop doing it . 
  if germany was a person i would say `` turning your life around and changing your ways is n't hypocrisy . '' . 
  i mean , is n't this `` change '' rather than `` hypocrisy '' . 
  would n't hypocrisy be if germany was criticising the us and britain whilst still maintaining its spying where as what germany * seems * to be doing here is stopping the spying . 
  or am i missing something ? 
  to be honest i 'm not fully sure what the treaty in the article actually means and whether or not that 's the key to stopping the us and uk from being able to spy on germans or whether it 's just being made out that way . 
  edit : regarding this phrase `` well yeah , but now germany 's trying to stop doing it . 
  '' : look , i put too much emphasis into that sentence and not enough ambiguity .
