i think most if not all people will agree that medical circumcision is fine . 
  people who try to attack campaigns against child abuse as `` islamophobic '' ( a word which meaning does n't exist ) deserve to fuck off and die of cancer . 
  religion means nothing compared to a child 's welfare . 
  74 % of denmark are anti-child abuse . 
  calling them antisemitic means that the holocaust was a good thing . 
  you ca n't have both . 
  the point is if we 're fearing people are going to take use risky illegal methods and outlets to circumcise their child it 'll end up mutilating it . 
  now if we ban female genital mutilation , that 'll do just the same and drive it underground , by this logic . 
  both male and female genital mutilation should be banned as they 're both pointless , unnatural and require things like lube to masturbate . 
  it 's disgusting to force this on kids . 
  the only medical benefits are for those with tight , defective foreskins who could n't tug anyway or have sex . 
  urgh i fucking hate the `` easier to clean '' nonsense . 
  you pull back the skin , you rinse it , you rub shower gel on and rinse again . 
  it should only be allowed in cases where it is happening to a consenting adult and to children with tight , already defective foreskins . 
  i expect the muslims will threaten to blow places up . 
  i hope no-one is scared into submission by them . 
  i wish we stepped into the ukraine conflict and fucked over the rebels and russians in there . 
  i 'm just saying it 's incredibly hypocritical to single out a peaceful religion like christianity as opposed to ignoring the homophobia of a religion which will bomb you if you criticise it and one which people are still being murdered in first world countries for criticising . 
  pretty much all churches are fine with gay people as well , whereas this is one guy and the fact that it needs setting up says it all . 
  oh so now religious zealots should n't be fought against and marginalised . 
  oh well , better chase that christian couple for merely having an opinion on homosexuality but not discriminate based on it . 
  oh right so christian intolerance is wrong , but muslim intolerance is fine ? 
  yeh it 's not as if there 's a limit on an infrastructure 's resources . 
  great , now let 's put some on a mosque next ... 
  i bet ` asylum seekers ' in that calais ghetto camp did this . 
  it 's quite surprising , considering what putin 's done to it 's people over this conflict . 
  it 's effectively put sanctions on itself , kicking out foreign business , threats of stopping fuel exports . 
  do n't they want money ? 
  it 's literally free money , you just send buyers the fuel and allow the business to give you money to set up shop on your land to then give you more money . 
  why ? 
  i mean i do n't think we should get rid of the imperial measurement we use , i.e. 
  miles in terms of cars , pounds and stone for weighing oneself , pint for certain drinks like milk or beer , but metric works better for everything else . 
  i heard one of the characteristics was merely ` russian speakers ' . 
  good luck with invading a nato country , dickhead . 
  we have overseas territories as does france , spain and the netherlands , our foreign policy would revolve around the eu protecting these islands and the trade routes around them . 
  i 'm sure the eu would also like a piece of britain 's antarctic pie . 
  does that mean you use proportional representation or similar voting systems ? 
  percentage of votes for parties is close to proportional to the representatives in parliament ? 
  they 're often universally characterised as unpleasant , aggressive , gangster , anti-social , uncivilised and try to talk like what they believe to be ` hip ' , often in a forcefully unnatural way . 
  it would have to be adopting uk plugs or the uk wo n't agree to it . 
  it 's good to have the grounding function . 
  i guess but i think it 's more likely to be about to have sex then have someone change their mind and get raped than someone who would n't normally be in a position about to have sex . 
  not saying it does n't happen though . 
  a lot of pubs in my area let customers use free wifi , so that just ruins it for them . 
  well i guess that 's the last time i let anyone use my computer , in case they search for cp or something . 
  i 'm fairly sure they say `` god '' in scotland . 
  unless you 're suggesting they ever spoke galic in the south ... 
  but then ... what 's with that border emphasising they speak welsh in a small segment of england ? 
  would n't brythonic apply everywhere south of edinburgh ? 
  i remember when i paid for a coach to take me to my ski resort and he took me over the german border ( as a shortcut ) . 
  i guess i was trafficked too . 
  but then you can argue the eu , or schengen , has replaced the previous concept of nation state or that there 's a binary transition between each individual eu member state and the eu being the nation state as a whole . 
  it 's not like there is no nation state at all . 
  in theory , you should n't be able to just walk into europe ... 
   we need to pick a side in order to stabilize the region . 
  brace yourselves , `` but the side you 're siding with , to create stability , used chemical weapons , therefore you 're fascist nazis and corrupt and evil '' is coming . 
  those are situations where between a couple , one of them does n't want it and the other forces them to . 
  assuming only men rape . 
  this is wonderful news . 
  they do that to the british isles all the time . 
  but it says `` or '' over it ... oh wait there 's a tiny smidgen of a different colour to indicate predominant galic speakers ? 
  i did not zoom in . 
  for what ? 
  doombar and korev ? 
  it does , people have previously tried to say `` britain '' means only great britain to try and distance themselves but also to try to invalidate northern irish residents who are british . 
  of course not , but we all know it 's because of the `` we have nothing to do with british '' attitude rather than merely disagreeing with a long established name of a geographic area . 
  it will be like the snp wanting to rename great britain if scotland gets independent . 
  i do n't recognise you , does n't mean you 're not real . 
   or is opposed to economic migrants when the country is the worst economic performer in europe ? 
  i 'm not against this particular sentiment but the kkk is known as a hate group and should n't really be connected to anyone who is critical of immigration systems . 
  i think calling something `` how to drink in a british pub '' and use london as a case study is a little bit ... unrepresentative . 
  brace yourselves `` ireland is not in the british isles '' is coming . 
   there is no table services . 
  every pub that does food has table service . 
  where sells only drinks and has table service ? 
  that 's not a general southern thing , it 's just some shitty expensive place . 
  my local pub does guest ales for # 2.50 . 
  some other place might do it for # 3.30 . 
  til ireland does n't use `` gold '' at all . 
  ** hates foreigners ** ** dresses up as american kkk **, 
  i do n't think you 're in the position to make threats . 
  no-doubt if i share this on facebook some cunt will say it 's not true . 
  you should 've said `` they 'd have had '' . 
  no-one says `` of '' like that . 
  he should 've said `` they 'd 've '' as a double contraction of `` they would have '' . 
  that 's so racist , the way they judge by skin colour / s, 
  wars with spain and france ? 
  fuck all impact on them . 
  has he just culturally appropriated something from my people ? 
  i 'm triggered now . 
  i think it 's from series 3 when some politician keeps doing press releases outside his house because of various repetitive scandals . 
  ends with `` needless to say that is the end of the matter '' . 
  it 's usually like `` i tripped and landed on a dildo that 's not mine or anyone in the house '' etc. 
  but is n't he also just repeating what someone else says and that someone else has evidence of dc putting his willy in a dead pig 's mouth ? 
  so how does this work then ? 
  do they just get away with saying this while the anon with the picture remains anon while not saying anything nor providing the proof ? 
   basically , the burden of proof is on the defendant ( the person said to have made the accusation ) . 
  well then it 's kind of odd the guy would write about it in his cameron book if he did n't have a picture as well . 
  i do think the fact that he has written it despite out libel laws does suggest it 's true because it would be pointless to lie about this when everyone knows how our libel laws are . 
   but i would n't if it set a precedent for terrorists & others to manipulate my entire nation under it 's direction i agree it was small minded and ignorant of anything .
