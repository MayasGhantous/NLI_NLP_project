  i was n't aware driving down the cost of labour was progressive . 
  it 's used on tonnes of things . 
  it definitely was branded co-op when i was younger but everywhere now i see `` the co-operative '' , even in adverts that 's what the narrator will say . 
  ... we did this in gb too ... 
  tbh i 'd prefer it if it was represented by an english flag rather than a british one . 
  asian : `` fuck it , it comes from our landmass , not yours '' . 
  maybe they should 've put an irish flag next to english language translations , to represent that it 's the most spoken language . 
  it 's bizarre , some famous people you hear of say their mother was of `` english , irish , scottish and dutch ancestry '' or something . 
  i guess spain or italy would be `` the third country '' . 
  i dunno if we 'll all end up saying `` let me qwant that for you ... '', 
  it was invented here . 
  a very old british tradition . 
  that 's brave . 
  i half expected them to just force islam on the entire population . 
  as an eu-sceptic i actually support ending roaming charges . 
  although literally fuck the eu if carriers start charging more . 
  the point is when that 21 year sentence is finished , he is reviewed and put away again for another 21 year sentence . 
  let 's hope they veto whatever visas merkel is illegally trying to hand out . 
  are we sure it was n't because they were , you know , nomadic and mostly known for causing crime and being allowed to just invade people 's land while the police does fuck all ? 
  yeah it 's their ethnicity what caused it , nothing to do with being travellers . 
  the dark ages are the undocumented period between the fall of the roman empire and the rise of the anglo-saxons ( england ) . 
   so we can expect feminists to start championing men 's right to equal pay right ? 
  remember , offence is only taken and not given . 
  was that their overall mission ? 
  was there another reason they were called in ? 
  even prince william is n't technically called `` prince william '' . 
  sorry , i mean they are n't protecting gay rights . 
  although i 'm sure that reggie yates documentary about homophobia in russia had police stopping gay people holding signs with pro-homosexual messages . 
  i do n't care if someone says `` the holocaust did n't happen '' usually it 's someone being edgy and it gets a laugh . 
  i even like the cheeky ways people would say it , so i 'd start with typing `` the holocaust '' into chat of some game or whatever and someone will reply with `` what , the thing which did n't happen ? '', 
  actual holocaust denial is more to do with anti-semitic ideology trying to blame the jews for some conspiracy to control the world and to feel sympathy etc. 
  but i find it amusing to interpret holocaust denial as something you can actively do several times a day , like `` i do n't deny the holocaust today '' or whatever . 
  it reminds me of [ pat condell 's blasphemy challenge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8pcecgwkei ) where he describes denying the holy spirit . 
  i guess in the case of a politician they need to recognise their country 's historical crimes . 
  you could . 
  you just had loads of checkpoints and searches by the army once the british army were called into protect catholics . 
  so ... he 's saying turkey 's islam is about terrorism , rape and murder ? 
  [ because if you did a 360 ... ] ( https://youtu.be/aicf1qdyxhm?t=26s ), 
   so norway has to almost endorse russia to be able to send people back there ... russia is n't persecuting anyone apart from perhaps homosexuals and there 's a fat chance norway will be allowing in millions of `` homosexual '' refugees . 
   ` do n't listen to quitters ' wow , thats , like , the best argument ever, 
  i read it with mr plinkett 's voice . 
  whoa there !, 
  just because someone 's a nazi does n't mean they hate blacks . 
  i guess it 's half a country now , eh ? 
   that 's pretty much the only thing foreigners remember about denmark what about [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=danish+women&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=699&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmi5lezl7e7yaivyl0ach2gfgz0#tbm=isch&amp;q=hot+danish+women ) ? 
  well it 's not like we can just nip over the border into the next country for a bit of shopping . 
  even the booze cruises to france took up an entire day especially the further away from kent you are . 
  we are simply used to staying in our own country other than on holiday . 
   britain has always adopted a policy of `` our island '' and `` the mainland '' as separate entities . 
  are n't they ? 
  what 's the point of either government if they 're not separate ? 
  should n't he put `` scrap ttip '' in there too ? 
   there 's already been found that many immigrants with darker skin tones experience vitamin-d deficiency because of our winters and prevalence to seasonal depression as a consequence . 
  oh so that 's your plan ? 
  claim you have `` saved '' so many people then have them all commit suicide once winter hits ? 
  only a sith deals in absolutes . 
  we do stone for weighing people , feet and inches for measuring people 's height and we want our beers served by the pint . 
  well there 's loads of muhammeds in muslim countries . 
  our little baltic buddies !, 
  \\ #killallstudentunions, 
  i did n't go to a russell one , probably would n't be on the radar for any `` politicians '' . 
  harassment against women . 
   student 's unions in the uk are all fucking terrible . 
  i would n't say all are , i do n't recall the one at my uni making stupid racist comments like this or having some racist/sexist agenda . 
   is n't that just scotland though ? 
  is there a criteria ? 
  implying we are n't norse ? 
  fucking baltics were removed from the op 's picture because it suited the agenda , so i 'd imagine finnish people would get classed as russian or something stupid , by that logic . 
   the uk 's northern europe now ? 
  seems to change every day . 
  we are further north than denmark , so is denmark not northern europe now ? 
  oh no , i guess we 'll have to introduce gender quotas ... oh wait ... you only do it when it 's women who are under-represented ... and only for middle class jobs ... 
  apologies for one of our british families dumping the corpse of their daughter they killed and somehow made money off publicising it as a mystery disappearance . 
  i 'm almost certain he 's judging them by their skin colour . 
  [ i can just imagine turkey 's face while having finger on the launch button ] ( http://cdn.meme.am/images/300x/12846163.jpg ), 
  til every single spaniard fucked off after teaching mayans spanish . 
  no-one 's forcing gay people into becoming priests . 
  sheep street, 
   also it 's labelled `` england '' why stop there ? 
  why not call it `` devon '' or `` exeter '' ? 
  you realise you turned the english ( and british in general ) one upside down right ? 
  so called liberals acting like real nazis . 
  hey , i guess fuck all women for not being muslims . 
  everyone 's still talking about 9/11 but no-one remembers anders ... well i guess whenever someone wants to name a white terrorist . 
  fuck me , danish women are so attractive . 
  i would 've lolled if it was lower than in 1988 . 
   he does n't care if people fact check him . 
  i guess facts trigger him as well . 
  i guess that 's chicken sausage or something right ? 
  or halal pork ? 
   before starting that kind of war . 
  [ preferably starting this kind of war ] ( https://youtu.be/ulpgwvc08ki?t=35s ), 
  germanic stronk . 
  we 're further north than mainland denmark but we do n't count as northern europe ? 
  i have a feeling they wont be having any brackwurst . 
  rip armenian empire . 
   masters of icanography ? 
  they repurposed an ancient symbol of peace . 
  they did n't invent shit . 
  masters of plagiarism more like .
