good , we ca n't have credibility in fighting tax havens around the world if we tolerate those that are on our own territory . 
  there are quite a few things the us should apply that logic to . 
  i do n't ask questions , i just masturbate . 
  is porn on vk banned as well ? 
  that 's basically my primary source for high-quality porn that would be struck down by the studios on us websites because of copyright . 
  i actually have a friend from uni that speaks fluent german and decided to move there while we still have free movement of people in order to get citizenship after a few years . 
   why are there people choosing to live in shanty towns in calais ? 
  the number of migrants in calais is the equivalent of a rounding error , a note in the margin of a thousand pages book . 
  the calais situation is completely overblown by british media that make it look like half of the middle-east is trying to enter the tunnel . 
  in the context of the migrant crisis , very few of them want to go to the uk . 
  because in this particular decade-old case they could n't rebuild their lives in the first place . 
  also , from what i 've read , these dutch somalis are the kind of migrants you want in your country . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/1479533/frustrated-somalis-flee-holland-for-the-freedom-of-britain.html  dutch rules make it hard for new arrivals to work for the first five years , yet migrants are resented if they live off state handouts . 
   `` we do n't want to depend on social benefits . 
  we 're a business-oriented people , but here the rules and red tape make it a nightmare to start anything . 
  you have to have a certificate just to clean houses . 
  in britain it 's so much easier if you want to set up a restaurant or a shop , '', 
  so years after they arrived into a new country more generous than the uk , once they rebuilt their lives , started learning the language , they will decide to start anew and move to the uk ? 
  why would they do that ? 
  they 've shown flexibility towards us for decades . 
  you ca n't be surprised that it does n't continue eternally . 
   we do n't have control over whether than person can enter and live in the uk or not . 
  and we ** chose ** not to control those people . 
  which is still having control over our borders . 
  it 's a choice made by a sovereign country . 
  well yeah . 
  you gave me money to buy my bread . 
  but if you want your money back you 'll also have to give me my bread back . 
  what is it with you people not understanding basic concepts ? 
  i 'm just trying to understand why you 're blaming on the eu something we , as a sovereign country , chose for ourselves . 
  it looks like you do n't understand what having control over something means in the first place . 
  i can open it , i can close it . 
  i have control over it . 
  just because i choose to open the jar does n't mean i do n't have control over it . 
  it 's the exact opposite , me choosing to open the jar is the purest example of the control that i have over the jar . 
   we do n't have full control of our borders as long as there is freedom of movement within the eu you did n't get the point , did you ? 
  i 'll repeat myself : we have full control of our borders , we just chose to let them open for some countries in exchange for a very lucrative access to their market . 
  which part do you not understand ? 
  you 're telling me that we are in schengen and that we 're absolutely not building a wall in calais ? 
  we have full control of our borders , we just ** chose ** to let them open for some countries in exchange for a very lucrative access to their market . 
  of course it was . 
  but even then the migrants they worry about are the eastern europeans , not the syrians . 
  the uk membership to the eu had no link with the migrant crisis in the first place since we 're not in schengen . 
  leave or stay , there will still be migrants in calais . 
  that 's one of the most idiotically superficial analysis of the vote i 've seen yet . 
  good job . 
  if you 're actually interested in knowing why people voted leave , here 's a good read . 
  we want bread and the baker wants us to pay for that bread . 
  big deal . 
  we chose to go down , and you 're coming with us . 
  an island so nice they named it thrice . 
  although immigration was a big topic , the main reason people vote leave was a false sense of lack of sovereignty rooted deep in their mind through decades of brussels-bashing by newspapers like the daily mail or the express . 
  the absurd myths that the uk is being outvoted every time , that 80 % of our laws are not decided by us , etc is what drove the vote to leave . 
  that 's only if you only read the headline . 
  the guardian strategically omitted a very important word . 
  people are not being denied surgery , they 're being denied ** elective ** surgery . 
  a surgery that is n't based on a medical emergency . 
  they wo n't deny surgery to an obese man that is having a heart attack , they will deny him cosmetic surgery , like gastric bands for example . 
  it 's neither unethical nor illegal . 
  i do n't think they 're being fooled . 
  they 're perfectly aware of who putin is but just do n't care because they think there is more important than the rule of law ( same phenomenon with trump or duterte in the philippines ), 
  both narratives are compatible . 
  the uk is doing fine because nothing has really happened ** yet ** . 
  it 's like taking a pill and expecting to have immediate effects . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  but that this is perfectly normal and easily predicted by someone with high-school level of economic knowledge . 
  currency crashes -  boost in exports . 
  it 's does n't cause narrative problems for anyone , as much as you 'd like it . 
   than before brexit brexit is not happening until at least 2 years , what are you going on about ? 
  also , of course you do n't break the momentum of the best performing country on the continent within a month , that 's not what 's been predicted when talking about the consequences of the vote . 
  and finally :  however , chris williamson , chief business economist at financial data provider ihs markit , said the bounceback was mostly the result of a `` huge policy response '' from the bank of england and the treasury . 
   `` you ca n't say that everyone who was ringing the alarm bells over brexit was scare mongering because really it was the warnings that triggered those strong policy actions , '' he said . 
  just the fact that you do n't have the euro and can leave whenever you want proves that anything the uk got into was the uk 's choice and absolutely not forced on them . 
  stop using the eu as a scapegoat for your national problems . 
  that 's just playing with words . 
  they still want access to the single market and ** hope ** that they do n't have to pay in if they negotiate . 
  wishes is no reality . 
   i 'll also have you know the uk along with germany are the biggest net contributors to the european budget that 's true  ( glad that wo n't be the case anymore ) that 's not true . 
  if you want trade , you have to pay in the budget and accept the regulations without a say in them , like norway is doing . 
  you guys managed to lose sovereignty . 
  trade is part of the european project . 
  what you want is to reap the benefits without giving anything back . 
  also , the uk would not be able to be part of a federal eu without the euro in the first place ( federalism will come through a common fiscal policy added to the current monetary policy ) . 
  the whole `` uk will be absorbed into a superstate '' is just fearmongering . 
  something le pen voters love to point out  https://youtu.be/kbhpsexy72y?t=34s - `` he has a nose that becomes more and more . . prominent '' - `` yes , yes . 
  it signs a bit his . . origins '', 
   cocaine smuggling that was the best part . 
  investigating him just because he used to be a customer of a private jet company that was later used to commit a crime . 
  french justice really fucked up with that one . 
  he was criticised for doing too much and being too nervous ( nickname : the hyper-president ) . 
  hollande for doing too little and being too limp ( nickname : [ flanby ] ( http://www.encollowen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/flamby.gif ) ) . 
  sometimes you wonder what people really want . 
  well , now it 's either him or jupp\u00e9 . 
  and at least he never had a giant effigy of himself burned at the stake in the street . 
  not really since he already did 5 years and the world did n't end . 
  good point . 
  second part still true thought . 
  many may despise european federalism , but this is the best example to show how much we would dominate if we were to be a single entity . 
  this is only olympic medals , but economically it 's the same podium . 
  russia thinks so too .
