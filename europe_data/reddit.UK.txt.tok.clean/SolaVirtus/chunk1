i imagine that people who know nothing about britain assume it 's like america . 
  1 point from ireland , 0 from aus . 
  time to rebuild the empire , they 've clearly lost their way . 
  it was , first time we 've dropped below 60 % since the end of the first world war though . 
  we 're yet to drop below 60 % for general elections i think , we 're not perfect , but 60 % is bloody low for such a big issue . 
  we suck at it , the music is mostly terrible , but it 's all good fun at the end of the day . 
  terry wogan was a much better host than graham norton though , graham is still good though ( although how odd is it that our two most well known eurovision commentators are irish ? ), 
  fair point , still found it interesting though , seems like it would be safer to leave the borders as they were . 
  did the guardian just recognise russian sovereignty over crimea ? 
  besides the point , the snp will put a second referendum in their manifesto if scotland is dragged out of the eu after voting to stay . 
  the uk exiting is probably the only thing that could cause a second referendum , and i think they 'd be very likely to leave us in that case . 
  true , but surely getting rid of it all together is n't a way to solve that problem . 
  you make a fair point , but his descriptions were part of his content , and if op ca n't take a little criticism he should n't post anything . 
  we pick the shiniest turd , but none of those shiny turds will ever deliver a way to not pick a turd . 
  to be fair , he 's being pretty aggressive right back , there 's an overall feel of `` you want some of ** my ** hard-earned money ? 
  work for it '' from op . 
  easy to be against taxes when your family owns an expensive business . 
  #  saying the inheritance tax only helps fat cats, 
  certainly , but it 's not a fault of the people , it 's a fault of the system keeping them politically ignorant , britain could be a direct democracy , but it would take 20 years of preparation . 
  it 's more the reason he stated , be against inheritance tax if you want to , but do n't say it benefits the fat cats when they 're the only ones who are hurt by it . 
  then he revealed his family business would be affected , his family are fat cats . 
  i think it 's more that he claimed inheritance tax is just a way for the fat cats to make money , but only the fat cats are fat enough to have to pay inheritance tax . 
  then he revealed his family would be affected , op is a fat cat . 
  who was extremely elitist . 
  to be fair , the tories would probably be considered left-wing in america, 
  no worries , have a nice day . 
  it 's in london . 
  rule britannia . 
  european empire ... i may have been playing too much civ, 
   a ** large ** country that speak the same language as you, 
  we had a lot of things standing in our way , 70 years ago we were tearing ourselves apart and the soviets were taking an eastern chunk for themselves , which they held for the majority of the last century . 
  today ? 
  a war in western europe is simply unthinkable , eastern european nations are being welcomed into the fold , if we told our great-grandfathers that , they 'd be skeptical at best , and horrified by the idea at worse . 
  we have a long way to go , but for a continent that used to be constantly at war with itself , the future looks bright . 
  britain is n't the only eu member that has it 's oppositions , it may seem that way as we 're a large country that speak the same language as you , not something you can say about any of the other countries , you 'll likely notice our euro skeptics more than you would france 's . 
  anyway , to answer your question : stronger ? 
  no , losing a large economy , a powerful military , and an easy door for american alliance and private investment would not strengthen the eu . 
  the `` great european project '' surely needs all major european nations to ever be considered complete , losing the uk would push that back . 
  more streamlined ? 
  yes , almost certainly , although a dissenting voice is n't always a bad thing . 
  in the uk , we have a handful of socialist and communist parties , but the biggest is the trade unionist and socialist coalition [ ( tusc ) ] ( http://www.tusc.org.uk/ ) , the [ green party ] ( https://www.greenparty.org.uk/ ) are quite left-wing for a mostly centre-right country . 
  in terms of groups , [ unite against fascism ] ( http://uaf.org.uk/ ) is the first that comes to mind . 
  there are probably some smaller regional organisations , but we have a bigger problem with the far right when it comes to activist groups . 
  on a purely aesthetic level , surely ireland should be united . 
  also , it looks like pretty much all the changes are in eastern europe , why ? 
  probably the act of union between england and scotland, 
  the opposite end , [ john o ' groats ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_o%27_groats ) is much nicer , if you 're after hiking , the scottish highlands are close enough . 
  [ merci , france ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/609/815/941.png ), 
  labour hoping for a minority labour government with support from the snp on a vote by vote basis , this will make labour a bit more left wing , but allow the rest of the house to downvote any talk of abolishing trident or starting hs2 in scotland . 
  true , but people far smarter than us would likely be the ones making those decisions . 
  not saying it would be easy or perfectly balanced , but the federalism argument is mostly a democratic one by the looks of it , and it 's unfair to england to treat it as a single member in a theoretical british federation . 
  i do n't doubt they 'd avoid as much as possible , the point it would be avoidance , not exclusion . 
  the royals have private property , this would remain theirs in a republic ( although they 'd no longer be exempt from inheritance tax ) buckingham palace is part of the crown estate , which belongs to the crown , not the windsors . 
  i know , yet the monarchists think we 'd go bankrupt in a week without a privileged family living in them . 
  every . 
  time . 
   the crown estate belongs to the reigning monarch ` in right of the crown ' , that is , it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign , by virtue of their accession to the throne . 
  but it is not the private property of the monarch - it can not be sold by the monarch , nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch . 
  http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/faqs/#whoownsthecrownestate the windsor family do not own the crown estate , so his entire argument is flawed . 
  obviously the magical tourism argument is thrown in there , but : a ) the only measurable tourist attraction affected by the current royals , royal residences , do quite poorly in terms of attraction b ) he provides no actual evidence that tourists think the monarchy is magical , nicely ignores that americans likely visit due to the shared language and he adds the uk 's complete tourist revenue to the `` income '' pile . 
  c ) mentions that tourists hate palaces in republics , but the louve and many former palances destroy every royal residence we have in visitor numbers . 
  it 's an insultingly bad argument for monarchism , yet people keep falling for it because it 's presented nicely . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'd love for the uk to go federal , so long as england is split into regions that coincide roughly with the population of scotland , so we 're 15 fairly equal regions instead of 3 small ones and 1 huge one . 
   uk a majority would be 3/4 i 've heard nothing like that from the snp , whenever it 's mentioned they say that every nation must vote in favour to leave ( that 'd benefit me as i do n't want us to leave , but i still do n't think it 's democratic that a northern irish no vote would be 30 times more important than an english yes vote ), 
  i think it 's already something like that , but the tours only run for a few weeks out of the year and barely scratch the surface of the actual palace if i recall correctly . 
  i 'd rather we stop thinking in terms of england as one entity , that 's led to london being the centre of the uk and other regions being neglected , i 'd prefer england to become a country in ceremony only , sharing a nationality you put on a form , a flag and sports teams . 
  a single english parliament would probably only take funding from the welsh , scottish and northern irish governments , this would be proportionate to the population difference and fair , but would strengthen the already growing nationalist movements . 
  basically , i 'd prefer 15 fairly equal parliaments than 3 tiny ones and 1 close to the size of westminster . 
  no reason why we should n't take population into account if we were to start drafting a federal britain , is n't gon na happen anytime soon though . 
  you 're right , english domination is the main reason why we need not a single english parliament , but around 10 to balance the regions with wales , scotland and northern ireland . 
  sadly , there is little call for federalism in england , makes little sense considering we 're the only home nation without devolved rule at this point . 
  it really disturbs me that the snp think it 's democratic to allow under a million northern irish people to keep the rest of the uk in the eu , even if there was a landslide vote to leave . 
  and i say that as someone in favour of the eu . 
  as a british republican , that 's generally the core of the opposition to the monarchy . 
  money wise , we 'd make a lot more tourist money if we could open up buckingham palace for full tours all year around . 
  everyone but the monarchy must pay inheritance tax, 
  i have to disagree , i 'm all for referendums , but not on this , imagine if men voted on women 's right to vote , or whites voted on the abolition of slavery ? 
  voting on equality means the fate of the minority is in the hands of a majority . 
  but let 's just agree to disagree , i 'm still happy that ireland is close to marriage equality . 
  yes , i get it , my point is bragging about being the first to have a referendum on it when you 're only having one because you 're * required * to do so instead of just making a law is silly . 
  it is . 
  although i do n't think civil rights for minority groups are things everyone should vote on . 
  i retract my statement although it 's still a little silly to brag about being the first country to have a referendum on it though when it 's far from being the first country to leagalise it . 
  most countries did n't need a referendum . 
  still though , hats off to ireland for having one , i 'm pleasantly surprised that it 's happening . 
  kinda reminds me of games on civilisation where you settle a in a long line so the enemy ca n't get though and grab the territory you 'll eventually claim . 
  it would take literally every german soldier for the nazis to stand a chance at defending their homeland on a permanent basis , leaving the western front undefended . 
  nazi germany was never going to win that war . 
   the referendum took literally decades to finally come around , probably because it look literally decades for independence and a party that supporting it to become popular  then the central government made false promises to win it . 
  welcome to politics , lets not act like the yes politicians did n't lie as well . 
   it did n't take long until a majority of scots polled regretted not seceding . 
  source  a permanent and massive majority of mps being from england . 
  i 'm sure that has nothing to do with england having a massively larger population than the other home nations  also , conquering land and replacing the natives/colonizing it ( northern ireland ) is also indicative of an empire . 
  saying that the current residents/colonists support union is kind of dishonest because the original residents were mostly kicked out . 
  ireland was an english colony , no argument there . 
  but hundreds of years passing since the original residents being kicked out kinda means the land belongs to those who live there , or do you support the ceding of the falklands to argentina or ignoring the democratic voices of those who are n't 100 % celtic britons ? 
  they fly in our airspace every now and again, 
  what kind of empire gives its colonies seats in the national government , a devolved government and a referendum on independence if they ask for it ? 
  sikhs and hindus do n't even feel `` foreign '' to me . 
  it literally says that on the crown estate 's own website .
