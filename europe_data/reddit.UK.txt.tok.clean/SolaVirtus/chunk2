  but , yeah , sure , `` opinion '', 
  [ the royals do n't own the crown estate ] ( http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/faqs/#whoownsthecrownestate ) so this entire video is based on a fallacy . 
  oh certainly , just sometimes it 's anti-putin position can appear as anti-russian, 
  i 'm sure any problems the uk has had with russia are nothing compared to most of eastern europe , so i have nothing to add . 
  i just wanted to say i respect you for pursuing this knowledge , especially on an often fairly anti-russian sub . 
  french is beautiful and seductive germany is authoritative and stoic spanish is passionate and caring italian is artistic and energetic eastern european languages are sexy german, 
  most european countries are historically christian , so they think christians would integrate better with their population . 
  churchill said what he needed to say to prepare the population for war , i 'm happy british imperialism is practically dead and we 're becoming more religiously diverse and agnostic . 
  the most important thing they were fighting for was mentioned though , `` our own british life and the long continuity of our institutions '' , that 's the important thing , britain remained free and was not subject to nazi rule . 
  also , he was certainly a product of his time , `` keep england white '' etc. , he was a great wartime leader , but many of the things he stood for were abhorrent . 
  [ `` never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_britain ) this might be a surprising choice for the former largest empire in the world , but personally i take the most pride in the home front during the second world war . 
  despite a seemingly impossible situation and tons of peace offers , we never entered into even a temporary truce with the nazis . 
  obviously we had a lot of help during this time , but leading a coalition of nations into an air victory despite being outnumbered and refusing to surrender despite horrific civilian air raids is something i admire , i take pride in my grandparents ' and great grandparents ' generations . 
  i 'd be half tempted to support that to be honest , alex `` you 'll give us a currency union or else '' salmond and nicola `` the uk can only leave the eu with scotland 's permission '' sturgeon have done more than enough to sour me on scottish politics . 
  more so than french or spanish ? 
  well , it may be nice to move somewhere one day , but i 'm not sure where . 
  it 's a bit more than just travel , i just want to learn a second language , and thought that i may as well learn the second most useful one i can , always good to have a plan b if english fails . 
  travelling europe , and then maybe parts of africa and the americas ( scandinavia is high on that list ) i 'll also be learning at least a bit of french as my girlfriends ' grandmother is french , so it would be nice to talk to her in her native tongue when i meet her next year . 
  thanks , i know i can get by with english , but would like to avoid being the rude no-effort tourist my country is famous for . 
  it was a pretty common claim on / r/scotland for a while , i do n't think it 's something you can blame on the english . 
  shame really , i was believing it until they said the bbc would say `` mall '', 
  traitor - snp, 
  we 'd never do that to tea !, 
  what kind of savages do you think we are ? 
  a true brit . 
  aww , look at america with his widdle ice creams , that comic always warms my heart . 
  with dna test results for paternity of canada . 
  i do n't think you should use `` undemocratic '' if you 're using it to say someone is worse than the queen ... 
  we can hope . 
  but for as long as the tories are able to keep people convinced that labour caused the crash and the snp are evil boogeymen , i think they stand a pretty good chance at winning in 2020 . 
  actually , there has been call for it to change for a while , the lib dems delivered an av referendum ( which was held without enough time for decent debates , but a shit load of anti-propaganda to be delivered ) even the bloody snp want political reform , and they were the greatest benefiters of fptp . 
  i do n't like ukip , but i want to live in a more democratic country . 
  every parliament in the uk except for westminster uses something fairer than fptp , even the tories elect their leader under av . 
  3rd party by popular vote , if our voting system was fairer they 'd be in a great place to become a coalition partner in 2020 . 
  hardly rekt when the tories only got 37 % and labour 30 %, 
  honestly , i would n't say it 's because of propaganda , hitler ran on a campaign of `` versailles was inherently unfair and overly cruel to germany '' and he was n't exactly wrong . 
  historians dismiss all other forms of nazi propaganda , so i would n't say they were taken in by one form of propaganda and none other . 
  you 're right in saying it was too late , although the uk and france did n't let germany break the treaty because they disagreed with it , they did it because they were powerless to stop them and terrified of another great war . 
  we are , but we could keep going back , you could blame bismarck for even uniting germany in the first place , hence why shifting the direct blame for ww2 away from the nazis can be a little useless . 
   not that german revisionism again historians around the world are in general agreement that versailles basically crippled germany and is what led to the rampant nationalism that allowed the rise of hitler . 
   the assasination in sarajevo was not the real cause of the war it was certainly one of them , but this is why i 'm saying when you want to play the `` but who is * actually * to blame '' game you could go back a very long time and down many different paths . 
  well , that 's a very deep hole to go down , directly , germany . 
  indirectly , britain , france and the entire league of nations for appeasing hitler , the ussr for giving them political support . 
  the leaders of the first world war for such harsh terms in the treaty of versailles . 
  as ww1 caused ww2 , should we blame austria-hungary for declaring war on serbia or the murderers of franz ferdinand ? 
  or blame germany giving their support to austria-hungary ? 
  it 's an incredibly detailed question that there is no one clear answer to , that 's why generally germany is blamed , even if the reasons for nazism 's rise and ideology can be explained in hindsight . 
  i 'm well aware of what the soviets did and how aware of their actions they were , as i said , i 'm not defending them , just saying that they were n't the direct cause of ww2 . 
  germany would have attacked poland with or without the soviets , the only thing they needed was a guarentee the red army would n't walk across the new border , which they got . 
  the soviets attacking as well was helpful , but not essential to them . 
  so germany would have invaded regardless , which means britain and france would have declared war regardless , so germany started ww2 . 
  for poland the war would have started regardless of which border it was on , but had britain and france continued with appeasement , it would n't have became a * world * war . 
   what about the soviet expansion ? 
  not on their doorstep , the uk and france were n't ready to deal with germany , yet alone the ussr , it was n't the most noble of acts , but they focused on the immediate threat to them rather than taking on two expansionist countries . 
  germany was well aware they 'd soon share a border with the ussr ( or was aiming to , i suppose ) hence the non-aggression pact . 
  i 'm not saying the ussr are blameless , but the majority of blame for the war starting rests on the nazis . 
   an art or a science a mixture of the two , an artisan craft . 
  the queen is n't * really * a leader in the way putin is though . 
  so long as they had the non-aggression pact , almost certainly . 
  although germany had proven itself to be the bigger threat to britain and france , so it was their expansion they cared about and what started the war , not soviet . 
   but how then can you ` leave reu ' if reu is eu without uk ? 
  reu can also mean `` the ** rest ** of the ** eu ** ''  also it is amusing that the british have invented a phrase for `` everyone but us '' in this context a natural occurrence when discussing leaving a union , ruk became an `` everyone but us '' phrase in scotland in the run up to the independence referendum . 
  if belgium had a referendum coming up , they 'd probably have an `` everyone but us '' term as well , it just makes discussion quicker . 
  ukip - officially more popular on / r/unitedkingdom than in reality . 
  generally the way with all geographical subs , if / r/unitedkingdom was an accurate representation the result of the election would have been a labour/green coalition . 
  22nd highest population with 5th highest gdp . 
  hardly a superpower and certainly stronger within europe , but to call us tiny is a little silly . 
  the snp want scotland to remain in the eu , surely if ukip are hypocrites , so are the snp ? 
  i doubt they 'd purposefully exclude them , just focus on getting the south american teams first . 
  well , i 'd agree we have many similarities , but i just meant that on average , most british people i meet have a pretty good opinion of germans . 
  we like you , you and the french are wankers , but you 're * our * wankers . 
  because she 's only turkish when it comes to explaining why she ca n't be racist . 
  i imagine when it comes to civil rights she 's rather happy to be british . 
  holy shit , the queen is smiling ? 
  `` scotland will leave the union ! '', 
  is being thrown out as a common argument from the remain side , i 'm not so sure they will , but if scotland votes to remain and the overall uk votes to leave , the snp will almost certainly put a promise for another referendum into their manifesto and almost certainly be elected on it . 
  scotland would leave the eu along with the rest of the uk , no nation in the uk has an opt out of a uk decision . 
  we 'll have the second scottish independence referendum , if it was held a week after the uk voted to leave i 'd put money on them narrowly voting to leave the uk , but if the pm is smart he 'll make them wait until a year or two after we leave the eu ( could just say the government needs to focus on eu negotiations and that the last one was too recent to try and put it off until after 2020 ) the greater the amount of time between the uk votes for brexit and scotland has indyref2 , the greater the odds of scotland staying in the uk are , with the sky not falling outside of the eu and scotland getting a fishing industry again , the snp would have a hard time keeping up the `` we were dragged out and that 's terrible '' rhetoric for that long . 
  basically , this vote could cause another scottish independence vote , but i do n't think the outcome of that second vote is as easy to predict as remain campaigners would like . 
  nope , never been there and only spoken to argentinians online or ones who came over , thanks for your reply , you 're certainly more likely to be right than i am ( about argentine opinion that is ) , have a good day . 
  really ? 
  most argentinians i 've spoken to have said that , from our perspective we do n't see why you 'd still care , surely their referendum essentialy makes continued claims pointless ? 
  he 's clearly just being an edgelord and thinks we 're the 51st state or something . 
  the general consensus over here is that none of you really care and that your government just uses it as a distraction every now and again . 
  true , shamelessly stole that one from him . 
  yes , although they 've been fine for a while , whenever they demanded the falklands we just ignored them , kinda like a child throwing a tantrum in public . 
  although jeremy corbyn 's ( leader of labour , the opposition party ) stated he supported something vague like `` dialogue '' or maybe it was shared sovereignty on the falklands , which is commonly used as criticism against him , so we do still care , we just do n't think argentina are a threat to them anymore . 
  thank you for doing your bit for the special relationship . 
  an american and a russian are sat at a bar , talking about the difference in their systems . 
  the american says `` in my country , i am free to walk up to the president and tell him i do n't like the way he 's running the us '' the russian says `` i can do that too , i am free to walk up to the general secretary and tell him i do n't like the way the president is running the us '', 
  oh , in that case then , definitely the big eu nations , trying to outdo the continentals is in our blood in every area except football , where we 're lucky to outdo wales . 
  i completely agree , it would be unfair on both sides for us to remain , you 'd keep expecting us to integrate further and we 'd keep resisting while resenting freedom of movement . 
  they 'll be a bit of an economic sneeze on both sides , likely worse for us in the short term , but i think relations will improve , you guys can get on with integrating and we 'll ( hopefully ) become a bit more internationalist than we can be in the eu . 
  i like to think we do n't have any rivals anymore , we live in peaceful times . 
  france and argentina can both fuck off though , naturally . 
  i just want to thank you for the sentiment , there are so many stories of people from tons of countries telling us to stay in , it 's nice to see someone from the eu respecting that this is our decision . 
  we 're probably never going to want closer integration though , that 's why i 'll be voting to leave , we 'll make better neighbours than housemates . 
  you guys actually liking us would be weird . 
  we 're quite happy with the frogs/roast beefs love/hate thing we have . 
  well , england , scotland , wales and northern ireland , sure we fight , but what family does n't .
