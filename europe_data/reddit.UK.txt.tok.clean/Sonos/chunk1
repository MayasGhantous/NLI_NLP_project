i would . 
  they need 2 % of gdp to be spent on defence to be eligible to join nato . 
  cant find the source atm , at work , it was definitely something to do with stopping the scottish mp 's from voting in the 2015 general election . 
  first past the post means that - yes it will . 
  labour loses seats . 
  cry everytiem, 
  you also get a say in uk politics till then . 
  except a bill is being rushed through in the event of yes to ban that . 
  which they will , because communism . 
  1066 was a norman . 
  not french . 
  you do n't get a say america . 
  you euros are awful salty . 
  then we agree to disagree . 
  til : scots still feel like subjugated slaves . 
  then we agree to disagree . 
  til : scots still feel like subjugated slaves . 
   call an election oh man i really doubt that . 
  and the uk breaking up ? 
  do n't see it happening what so ever , our cultures are so tightly intertwined . 
  everyone sees it as * easy * since the referendum . 
  but it 's really , * really * not . 
  yep , guess its just semantics at this stage . 
  no , hes still the pm , and will be till a new leader is decided . 
  ~ 9th sept. 
   boris et al most of the conservative goverment are/were sympathetic to the eu , most wanting to remain . 
  lib dems and scots have no power in stopping or having the final say , it 's all up to the conservatives . 
  just like how ukip has no power . 
  that 's good then . 
   team brexit there is no team brexit anymore . 
  it 's the uk government . 
  that last one was non binding , it wouldnt have applied - and could be redacted at any point by the eu . 
  thats weird . 
  holyrood has no foreign policy remit , so she could get in trouble for this . 
  ontop of that , this goes against what jcj said about no negotiations before article 50 . 
  its not going to happen . 
  they will never join . 
  spain will fight it to the death . 
  scotland is not a wealthy nation , they mostly subsiside from the rest of the uk . 
  i ca n't see it happening . 
  well , he could defect to the tories . 
  he 's not in power . 
  so i do n't get whats wrong here . 
  what a historic day . 
  my god that man child is insufferable . 
  you pay tax for me ? 
  that 's a new one . 
  you seem really really salty . 
  that case looks awfully like a bomb ...

  thats not the line i was expecting in reply . 
  triggered . 
  never thought i 'd die side by side with an american . 
  i was pretty on the fence about voting remain or for voting leave . 
  so i did n't do either . 
  so i do not fall into the category of * nationalist skin heads * or * lousy unrepentant rural shits * or * dickheads * thank you very much . 
  what do they have to be repentant for ? 
  you seem abit salty ? 
  we brits are fellow * europeans * as well you know . 
  i 'm not celebrating anything . 
  merely pointing out an inconvenient truth . 
  i am , however , enjoying the downvotes . 
  the iron price !, 
  eu finances are * fucked * . 
  sorry , france and germany your bill is going up !, 
  edit : downvoters - ah so soothing .

   sadly . 
  lol . 
  the one that loses the labour party all of the popularity in the polls !, 
   corbyn is anti eu , and has been for most of his life . 
  the uk paid for those things if you take them off our bill we pay to the eu . 
  given that we are a net contributor . 
  [ enjoy your budget shortfall . 
  ] ( https://i1.wp.com/order-order.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/eu-%c2%a3250-miillion.png?w=540&amp;ssl=1 ) everything after us on that list , put together , doesnt even cover half of what we paid in . 
  except they dont . 
  they are all terrified of who is going to foot the bill after we leave . 
  [ then you 've not been paying attention ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft4_fefew78 ), 
  the uk is leaving the single market .
