they see what 's written in the daily mail and the sun and about how many immigrants are ` flooding our borders ' and make an opinion about the entire eu based on that . 
  [ 250,000 immigrants every year ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2014/sty-net-migration.html ), 
  hopefully we will soon be out . 
  it oversaw the investment as a regulatory body . 
  hpc is being invested in by private corporations such as edf energy , and also the british government . 
  the eu is not funding hpc . 
  fair enough . 
  i just qualified what i said . 
  a subsidy denotes charity to make up the numbers . 
  hpc is an investment , and a money making scheme . 
  any news coverage of hinkley point c. 
  hinkley point c is a private financial investment , not from the eu , and the british taxpayer is paying extortionate rates because of it . 
  wales is an odd one . 
  i personally think if immigration is a concern to a population then they should be allowed to say so without being bullied . 
  but wales is not exactly a magnet for immigration is it ? 
  i thought some parts of wales were the poorest in the uk ? 
  i see . 
  thanks for your detailed answer . 
  how so ? 
  400k actually , for all 100 . 
  and they 're no longer fighting , they 've fled and if you think isis is having them back after that then you 've not been reading the news . 
  they 're just bumming around turkey doing nothing in particular . 
  i have no problem abandoning these bandits to their fate . 
  not to us . 
   there will be no russian invasion , stop believing the fearmongers people said that about ukraine . 
  ok , well put it this way . 
  at least their kleptocrats do n't openly and brazenly hold political office and dictate policy to other foreign sovereign nations , who did not elect them . 
  there is no excuse to have unelected officials in the eu . 
  talking about the usa is trying to deflect the issue . 
  the eu political establishment is rotten and unjustifiable in its existence . 
  nothing makes a uk exit ( and other nations ) from the eu more of a certainty . 
  if you think our * completely unelected * leaders are n't corrupt then i have some snake oil to sell you . 
  yeah no thanks mate . 
  do n't you tory me boy !, 
  i 'll give you such a torying in a minute young man !, 
  seems like more of a political move to me but fair enough . 
  of the netherlands ? 
  whats the difference pre-1900 ? 
  well so do england and france , and germany and france . 
  french is easily the single biggest influence on english as our nobility were always shagging one another . 
  fair enough . 
  they were n't french though , as in the kingdom of france . 
  the repeatedly battled and raided the frankish kingdoms below them . 
  well , if we 're counting the normans then yeah . 
  but the normans were more just vikings that invaded france , then invaded england from france . 
  france . 
  did i at any point say there were n't ? 
  what on earth are you on about . 
  i am not a practicing christian , nor am i a ugandan ... 
  the circumstances are , that immigrants and second generation immigrants have cultural qualities from wherever they came from . 
  in majority muslim countries , this usually translates to non-existent gay rights , horrendous women 's right , a warlike disposition , sympathy for terrorism , and rampant anti-semitism and racism . 
  these are cultural traits which exist particularly ( though not exclusively ) among young , second generation immigrant men from muslim majority countries . 
  these traits must die . 
  and they must be killed by the islamic community themselves . 
  any help we can give the moderate islamic community to do this , we must give . 
   so what we have a problem with is a gang culture then , yes ? 
  rather than make it a race or religious thing lets look at the other circumstances as well . 
  it is especially predominant in the muslim community . 
  i want to give the moderate muslims as much influence and help as i possibly can to help them stamp out these attitudes from their community . 
   the problem i have with your analysis is that it is a huge over simplification . 
  surely you are the over-simplifying if you are saying its `` just a problem with gang culture '' ? 
  it is a hugely nuanced issue regarding the place of muslims in a predominantly non-islamic society , and the culture death felt by many second generation immigrants . 
  pretending it is unrelated to a religious group is just stupid and wrong . 
   so serial rapists commit more sexual attacks than the average person ? 
  the point im making is that statistics are unreliable . 
  obviously , a qualitative critique is far more reliable . 
  oh they are . 
  in fact that is the point i was trying to make . 
  in reality , accurate analysis of uk islamic culture must be far more qualitative . 
  statistics may be bent to suit anybody 's agenda . 
  `` there are three kinds of lie : lies , damned lies , and statistics '' - mark twain, 
  yes they do . 
  if i saw young white people espousing racist opinions i ( and virtually any other person ) would take it upon themselves to stamp them out . 
  i have a responsibility to maintain the culture i am a part of . 
  you 're not wrong , i just do n't know point are you trying to make ? 
  * italics *, 
  this is so good . 
  top marks . 
  ask , and ye shall receive : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gcvpb/english_right_wing_activists_have_a_new_uniform/ckhws00, 
   all the muslims i 've met ( or apparently people who claim to be muslims but are n't ) are some of the kindest , most inclusive people i 've met i 'm quite sure they are . 
   in 2011 there were 2.7 million muslims in the uk . 
  if 1400 incidents occurred 1400 attacks on children were perpetrated by a single gang in rotherham . 
   the number of people in ` islamic rape gangs ' ( who , if you look in the koran , are nothing like ` model muslims ' ) is incredibly minute . 
  it 's still far too large . 
  let 's rally with moderate muslims and create an atmosphere of condemnation against anybody with these kinds of stone age barbaric opinions !, 
   you 'll make more friends in the statistical fanclub if you demonstrate whether these numbers are extraordinary . 
  64.1 people in the uk - [ ons ] ( http://ons.gov.uk/ons/taxonomy/index.html?nscl=population ) 21,493 child victims of sexual violence in the uk 2011/12 - [ nspcc ] ( http://www.nspcc.org.uk/inform/research/findings/howsafe/how-safe-2013_wda95178.html#findings ) this means the average person rapes 0.00033530421 children in one year . 
  this means that statistically ( and unrealistically ) one in 3000 people will sexually attack a child attack per year . 
  to divide the total number of rapes in the rotherham scandal ( 1,400 ) by the number of men ( 5 ) over the number of years ( 16 ) we get this : ( 1,400 / 5 ) / 16 = 17.5 children per year per person . 
  17.5 / 0.00033530421 = 52191.4 so each person in the rotherham rape gang committed ** 52091.4 % ** more sexual attacks on children in one year , than the average uk citizen . 
  ** do n't choose political fashion , over doing what is right . 
   and given the huge number of muslims in the uk , i very much doubt it 's all of them , or even a sizeable minority this is a pretty naive thing to say . 
  we are talking about a sustained campaign of sexual violence towards 1,400 children , including plying them with illegal and dangerous drugs . 
  this was then covered up by the political establishment who did not want to `` appear racist '' ( what pathetic worms of people would let even one young girl be raped rather than appear racist , i do not know . ), 
  these attitudes and practices do not spring up out of a vacuum . 
  within islam there is a high plateau of unnacceptable opinion on people of other races , religions , and sexual orientations , from which extremism easily launches . 
  i think it 's very important to draw a line between moderates and extremists . 
  i have no issue whatsoever with different cultures with more conservative opinions that my own influencing politics and opinion . 
  but when those opinions regard white people / non-muslims as `` kuffar '' which if we are being honest is an extremely derogitory term on a par with `` abeed '' and probably just short of `` n **** r '' ; and who advocate female genital mutilation , and regard raping vulnerable young girls as `` boys being boys '' well then they can be regarded as polyps on society who we would do well to be rid of . 
  the guy in the video actually says `` muslamic rape gangs '' in a drunken idiotic slur .
