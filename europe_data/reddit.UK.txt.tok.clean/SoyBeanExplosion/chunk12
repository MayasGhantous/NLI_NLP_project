  i think for most people it 's literally just a matter of not being aware of the facts of the matter , and that 's not necessarily their fault , because the industry makes a concerted effort to restrict access to this information through things like ag-gag laws . 
  other times they 're aware that if they did a bit of research they 'd probably have to stop eating meat , but they really like the convenience and taste , and consequently never go and do it . 
  either way , i do n't think that makes them idiots or unintelligent at all . 
  hahaha , oh man , you sure got me !, 
  what an original joke !, 
  nothing gets by you does it ? 
  idiots often sound intelligent to other idiots . 
   i do n't give a shit about animal welfare . 
  this is a cognitive failure to respond in the appropriate way to the relevant facts and reasons such as their relevantly similar capacity to suffer ( physically , mentally , emotionally ) and basic moral commitments such as the impermissibility of inflicting unnecessary suffering . 
  so part of this is going to come down to what it is we think actually makes it wrong to kill a human being . 
  if we imagine a hypothetical person - bob - who 's not actually engaged in * any * particularly forward-thinking activity ( they 're not planning or feeling excited about the next day etc. 
  ) , and just about their next meal or next fuck ( actually , i can think of several people i know like that ... ) , - even if those were the only two things he had ever done - we 'd still think it would be immoral to kill them , even if it was done in their sleep with a bolt-gun , right ? 
  ( if you disagree with that intuition then what i say next probably wo n't have much hold with you ) i think a fairly plausible account of what * makes * this wrong is that we can expect that bob will have a future of value to him . 
  as long as i do n't go and kill him , he 'll probably go on and live a fairly good life by his own standards - he 'll enjoy his life of meals and fucks quite a bit . 
  by killing him , even in his sleep , i 'm depriving him of his future . 
  in terms of the most relevant species to what we 're actually talking about here , it 's been demonstrated that pigs are [ highly social and reallyintelligent ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/15/are-pigs-intelligent_n_7585582.html ) , or in other words that that they 're `` intelligent , emotional , and cognitively complex '' ( [ psychology today ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201506/pigs-are-intelligent-emotional-and-cognitively-complex ) ) . 
  cows are also intelligent creatures ( [ huffington post ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cows-are-way-smarter-than-you-thought_us_55b631ede4b0224d8832b382 ) ) , have [ * highly * complex , rich emotional lives ] ( https://www.wired.com/2014/06/the-emotional-lives-of-dairy-cows/ ) , and [ according to jonathan balcolme ph.d in psychology today ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-inner-lives-animals/201008/it-s-time-magazine-respect-cows ) , `` it 's time to respect cows '' . 
  when we look beyond our own species , we can actually see many of the behaviours you mention , but also many beyond them . 
  they feel happiness , fear and love ( in fact there 's some good evidence they experience [ the same range of emotions we can ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-mysteries-love/201402/can-animals-love ) , and some are even capable of [ maintaining friendships ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229700-400-friendship-do-animals-have-friends-too/ ) , even [ across species ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/wild_things/2013/11/29/animal_friendships_cross_species_relationships_in_captivity_and_the_wild.html ) in some cases ) . 
  and in fact many species * do * demonstrate fairly extensive future planning . 
  short bit on that [ here ] ( http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/can-other-animals-plan-ahead ) , and there 's a longer piece on how other apes plan ahead like us [ here ] ( http://www.livescience.com/2620-humans-apes-plan.html ) * and * how they can use sign language to communicate thoughts and desires ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_ape_language#primate_use_of_sign_language ) ) . 
  given that many other species exhibit these capacities to varying degrees , it might also be worth thinking about how you feel about human beings who are n't able to plan extensively about the future , particularly due to mental and learning disabilities which limit their mental faculties quite significantly . 
  would it really be okay to kill them in their sleep with a bolt-gun ? 
  in an abstract ` it comes from dead animals ' way , sure . 
  but they know almost nothing at all about the conditions in which those animals were raised or slaughtered . 
  i already won the argument when he responded to rational arguments with `` i do n't care '' . 
  after that point has been reached , further discussion is pointless , because they 've already admitted they are n't approaching it from a position of reason but from a position of emotion and prejudice . 
  i might as well poke a little fun at him at that point . 
  sorry if i hurt the very delicate fee-fees of meat-eaters in this thread . 
  ah okay , so you 're just not very intelligent , thanks for clearing that one up . 
  by the way , that 's not actually how the false-equivalence fallacy is used . 
  good effort though . 
  [ is-ought fallacy ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/naturalistic_fallacy ) . 
  ' [ lions do it ] ( http://www.godfist.com/vegansidekick/guide.php#a15 ) ' is not a moral justification . 
  nature is not a moral role model . 
  we 're humans , we 're rational and capable of realising that killing and raping are wrong . 
  ah that 's a shame . 
  well frankly , if all you do is cut down on the amount of meat you consume you 're still making a positive difference . 
  i would definitely recommend doing a little bit of searching and reading on those subreddits though , because i 'm sure there 'll be others from prague with suggestions . 
  there might be some really nice little restaurants and shops you have n't found yet !, 
  meat * is * tasty !, 
  i do n't know anyone who went veggie because we hated the taste of meat haha, 
  you seriously think that outweighs the factors just listed above ( which , btw , significantly understated the levels of suffering it causes ) ? 
  either you 're an idiot or a psychopath . 
  i do n't know where you live , but in the uk i 've had absolutely zero trouble being vegetarian . 
  i 've never been to a restaurant , cafe , pub , or grocery store that did n't serve vegetarian meals and food . 
  i 've had trouble in some parts of the continent though - rural france and spain have been tricky , but my experience in berlin and vienna was very positive . 
  it might be worth searching those subreddits to see if there are resources or other people from your country , i 'm sure they 'll have advice and suggestions . 
  exactly . 
  this is why in a number of american states there are ` ag-gag ' laws ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ag-gag ) ) which prohibit `` the act of undercover filming or photography of activity on farms without the consent of their owner -- particularly targeting whistleblowers of animal rights abuses at these facilities . '', 
  these businesses have guilty consciences . 
  because the truth is that this abuse is widespread , and even among the ` nicest ' farms all the animals eventually meet a grisly end , and if people found about this - either through undercover filming , or through cctv recordings - people would probably stop buying their products . 
  it numbs you . 
  it 's why if you talk to any farmer about the animals they rear , they always tell you that the trick is to refuse to form an emotional bond with the animals before the slaughter . 
  you have to see the animals as objects . 
  those bonds naturally form because these animals - cows , pigs , etc. 
  - have emotional lives and form relationships . 
  they have social circles , they recognise individuals , form attachments , feel emotions such as fear and happiness as vividly as we do . 
  if you acknowledge those and bond then it obviously makes it much more difficult to fire a bolt-gun into their skull or slit their throat , because it would * almost * be as if you were doing something immoral . 
  i think this user [ linked it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65321o/the_netherlands_government_is_considering_placing/dg7b0jl/ ) . 
  i have n't watched it though , i already refrain from most animal products including meat , i do n't need further trauma to convince me of a position i already hold . 
  if i raise you with the explicit intention of eating you , give you a good life and then kill you painlessly in your sleep , is that morally okay ? 
  please take the opportunity you 've got here to look into vegetarian and vegan alternatives . 
  there are so many resources out there , even if you just have a look around at / r/vegetarian , / r/vegetarianism , and / r/vegan . 
  i did it myself overnight three years ago and i have n't looked back since . 
  if you have any questions or concerns please either pm me or use those subs . 
  unfortunately that probably wo n't work , a lot of these meat-eaters are conditioned into a kind of psychopathy . 
  they 're genuinely numb to the suffering and violence . 
  it 's moments like these that i actually begin to understand the [ ecofeminist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecofeminism ) movement . 
  [ tax the bankers the bonuses to 100 % it 's disgusting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3tuqrbimvo ), 
  valletta is definitely worth seeing , though i do n't know how the refugee crisis has affected it since i visited . 
  it 's an absolutely beautiful city . 
  [ the upper barrakka gardens ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=upper+barrakka+gardens&amp;num=20&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewisjrws35_tahuracakhfj3b_kq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950 ) are one of my favourite places in the world . 
  lots of interesting history and museums , beautiful architecture , stunning views , great restaurants . 
  the doctors know more than you . 
  i wonder what sort of welcome they 'll get ... 
  good to see . 
  it 's plain corruption and should be dealt with . 
  they need to be made examples of . 
  afaik osaka has the highest crime rate in japan , but has a lower crime rate than any city in the us . 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  ( get it ... ? 
  because ... sheep ... 
  i 'll let myself out ... ), 
  you said ` fuck you ' to me and called me a ` racist piece of shit ' . 
  you 're lucky i 'm even dignifying you with a response . 
  if you act like a child you will be treated as such . 
   there was no independent greek country it was ottomon , so by saying the greeks having ownership rights just because they are greek means that you claim is based on heritage . 
  they were * made * when greece was ... greece . 
  well , athens , sparta city states etc. 
  it was the * permit * that was gained ( extremely dubiously , they woefully understated what they were taking ) while greece was ruled by the ottomans . 
   the last people with a legal claim or a claim not based on heritage are dead . 
  any greek has a legal claim . 
  whether it has a possibility to be successful should they ever try to exercise that claim in court is another matter . 
  the fact that the people who built them are dead is n't very important . 
   i would be pissed but my grandson would have no claim on big ben . 
  he absolutely would imo , and that 's where we 're going to have to agree to disagree . 
   is wrong and racist . 
  you keep using that word , i do not think you know what it means . 
  to base a claim on the fact that it rightfully belongs to a particular people because they created it is not racist at all .
