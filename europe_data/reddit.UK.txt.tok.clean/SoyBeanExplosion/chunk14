  they refuse to apply for asylum in france . 
  and then they go on fucking hunger strikes and demand that the british government take responsibility for their situation as if it * was n't * entirely of their own making . 
   it 's mostly made to standardize things . 
  which is another flaw in the eu . 
  a relentless desires to standardise , standardise , standardise . 
  the one solution does not necessarily work for all the different countries of the eu . 
  we 're already seeing that with the southern mediterranean countries . 
  the eu has no appreciation at all for the different situations and needs and problems in different eu countries . 
  the only thing i was ever taught about it was the prague spring . 
  at no point did he try to justify this attack . 
  all of the studies i saw on that link estimate reasonably * at most * between 2-5 % , and even then they all admit it 's hugely difficult to work out what 's a genuine false rape accusation and what 's an accusation that just does n't go forward to court . 
  it 's not one where it 's easy to work out what 's a lie and what 's just not provable . 
  i mention the cps because a ) that seems to be the most recent one with a decent paragraph on it and b ) it 's most relevant to me as a brit . 
  british home office say at most 8 % , fbi say 2 % . 
  all of the ones that estimate significantly higher specifically have the flaws in their methodologies pointed out . 
   not all that tiny from that very same link here 's the paragraph from the cps :  a report by the crown prosecution service ( cps ) examined rape allegations in england and wales over a 17-month period between january 2011 and may 2012 . 
  it showed that in 35 cases authorities prosecuted a person for making a false allegation , while they brought 5,651 prosecutions for rape . 
  keir starmer , the head of the cps , said that the `` mere fact that someone did not pursue a complaint or retracted it , is not of itself evidence that it was false '' and that it is a `` misplaced belief '' that false accusations of rape are commonplace . 
  [ 9 ] he added that the report also showed that a significant number of false allegations of rape ( and domestic violence ) `` involved young , often vulnerable people . 
  about half of the cases involved people aged 21 years old and under , and some involved people with mental health difficulties . 
  in some cases , the person alleged to have made the false report had undoubtedly been the victim of some kind of offence , even if not the one that he or she had reported . '', 
  this is bullshit mate . 
  stop it . 
  a tiny , tiny minority . 
  we should not be basing how we approach rape around them . 
  they wanted to massively reduce foreign aid by something like [ 75 % ] ( http://www.ukip.org/ukip_has_reaffirmed_its_commitment_to_cutting_the_foreign_aid_budget_by_9_billion ), 
  well the difference is that across europe we 've actually managed to take guns out of circulation . 
  that 's the * only * reason other gun control measures work . 
  australia had to do the same thing , they had a * huge * process to deal with that . 
  the problem the us has is that it has an incredibly porous southern border with mexico , meaning a steady flow of illegal guns kept in constant circulation . 
  so the gun control debate in the us is actually linked on a fundamental level with immigration reform . 
  it 's amazing . 
  it feels vibrant and alive and * things are happening here * , but the public transport is amazing , the architecture is beautiful , the history and culture are deep , the linguistic variety makes it easy to spend time there even if you do n't speak much german , and from what i understand the property prices are n't all that bad either . 
  it 's like a big city minus the things that i almost always hate about big cities . 
  i usually prefer small towns and villages , coming from one myself , but vienna is one of only two or three exceptions to me . 
  i 've been to salzburg and it was mixed for me . 
  i 've been to the area around neumarkt-am-wallersee some 7 or 8 times , love that area . 
  salzburg was mixed though - unlike the parts of vienna i stayed in , salzburg felt like much more of an economically diverse city - that is to say , i often walked through downtrodden and grim areas i felt unsafe in . 
  i 'm sure vienna has parts like that , i think i got a glimpse of it near the river , but all the parts i saw were lovely . 
  oh ok , so we put the entire burden on hungary and greece and italy to deal with asylum , while those of us conveniently not near the actual crisis can just pretend nothing is happening, 
  if i could choose to live in any country in the world i would probably pick austria , vienna in particular . 
  no one is calling for an end to all immigration . 
  also , many of them get mistaken for muslims all the time . 
  this was actually a huge problem just after 9/11 , sikhs getting blamed or attacked as part of the backlash against muslims . 
   the patent system is broken but has worked reasonably well in the face of a need for some kind of return on r&d investment in a capitalist society . 
  and without some kind of return calculation , then there is no system for choosing the correct r&d investments and to reward those that make the right decisions . 
  but we 're not arguing about the effectiveness of the patent system . 
  the original argument was that capitalism is the only economic system capable of harnessing human potential for innovation . 
  my point which you seem to accept is that even within capitalism , we have to suspend markets and competition almost indefinitely as a prerequisite for having innovation . 
  people say that competition breeds innovation but we have to grant monopolies in order to get innovation . 
  and this is n't a tiny point that people out there has figured out a response to : the issue of patents is an * enormous * issue for libertarians and anarcho-capitalists for this very reason , though of course they believe they 've figured it all out . 
  i actually recently saw a very interesting explanation of how capitalism stifles innovation . 
  i ca n't remember the link , it was an old reddit comment i stumbled upon while using the search system . 
  but i 'll try and explain what he said : for a given entrepreneur considering dedicating himself to creating some innovative new product , they make a risk/reward calculation : what risks am i taking , and how likely is this to pay off for me ? 
  and what 's the pay-off ? 
  is it worth it ? 
  the truth is that under a truly free market , * there is no incentive * to innovate . 
  why bother ? 
  anything you create will be quickly reverse-engineered and made cheaper by companies who did n't have to dedicate all their resources to actually inventing it in the first place . 
  the entire risk is placed on that one actor while all the possible rewards are spread around everyone else . 
  in terms of risk/reward , there 's no pay-off in an actual free market . 
  how our current economic system tries to fix this internal contradiction is by granting a temporary market monopoly in the form of a patent . 
  it temporarily * suspends * the very system this innovation is supposed to justify so that this innovation can actually come about . 
  monopolies also lead to inefficient markets . 
  and on top of that , governments * have * to subsidise basic scientific research which has only long-term benefits to spread out the development costs , because again there 's no short-term benefits which capitalism focuses on and what benefits there are are dispersed among everyone , not just for those who actually achieved that innovation . 
  so i think it 's interesting that capitalism and markets/competition are considered to be the only system capable of truly harnessing human innovation , but that very system * has * to be suspended in order for innovation to actually be allowed to flourish . 
  truth is we 'd get a lot further if we worked together . 
  there 's a very interesting essay in ` blue labour : forging a new politics ' entitled ` civil economy : blue labour 's alternative to capitalism ' by adrian pabst , and i 'll just quote it because i have the book in front of me and i think people might find it thought-provoking . 
  it 's only a short passage . 
   the second element that binds together the civil economy tradition with cst [ catholic social thought ] is the balance between competition and cooperation . 
  instead of purely individualist and competitive contract that characterises capitalism , the market economy has a price mechanism that operates to a degree cooperatively as well as competitively . 
  so , for example , it is not assumed that you would always charge the highest possible price that the market would tolerate . 
  you might lower that price to help your neighbour because you did not want to destroy your neighbour and it would not even make * economic * sense to do so . 
  now even tough-minded economists are rediscovering this idea that so-called ` shared value ' makes much more economic sense than maximising profit and supplementing capitalism with exercises in ` corporate social responsibility ' that are little more than window-dressing . 
  as pope benedict xvi put it so succinctly in * caritas in veritate * , ` in * commercial relationships * the * principle of gratuitousness * and the logic of gift as an expression of fraternity can and must * find their place within normal economic activity * . 
  this is a human demand at the present time , but it is also demanded by economic logic ' . 
  the entire essay is a rather fascinating read , though this is all a huge detour from the actual article haha, 
  awwww, 
  yeah because that 's * all * that 's going on in syria . 
  just a bunch of free-riders . 
  turkey i 'm not so sure about , particularly in the southern border region . 
  not because it 's not suitable to live in but because the turkish government are stretched thin and they just are n't able to protect and look after the refugees as they should or would like to be able to . 
  but certainly by the time you 've reached denmark you 've really got no excuse at all . 
  okay . 
  pretty much a case study in how * not * to do immigration and integration . 
  [ over a dozen grenade attacks ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/09/uk-sweden-grenades-idukkcn0qe09f20150809 ) over the last year , [ car bombs ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/310757-sweden-malmo-blasts-crime/ ) , a massive and terrifying rise in antisemitic harrassment and hate-crimes mainly by muslims that the un watch consider `` extremely serious '' ( [ cbc ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/anti-semitism-in-malm\u00f6-reveals-flaws-in-swedish-immigration-system-1.3080484 ) , [ haaretz ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.667887 ) , [ the local ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20150311/obama-team-in-sweden-to-study-anti-semitism ) , [ npr ] ( http://www.npr.org/2015/01/26/381647473/journalist-documents-anti-semitism-in-a-swedish-city ) , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden#antisemitism ) ) back in 2008 there were huge riots , and the 2013 riots that started in stockholm spread to it as well . 
  the city essentially has no integration , it just has enclaves of minorities and immigrants stuck in the poverty trap where crime and violence gestate . 
  it 's a microcosm of sweden 's broader failings when it comes to their immigration system . 
  nah , she 'll offer everyone a place and then force countries who never agreed to this in the first place to take them . 
   but we can fix that i hope for your sake you can . 
  we do n't want malm\u00f6 writ large . 
  or they 're two different photos of two different victims . 
  i wish people would n't treat this issue as though it were a simple ethical issue with easy , black-and-white answers . 
  it 's like how people ca n't seem to understand why some people who believe that abortion is murder might want the law to reflect that . 
  there are a number of huge issues at play here , from whether doctors have the right to refuse to take a life , their duty of care , whether opening this pathway up will mean that patients who are expensive to take care of are pressured into the more cost-effective treatment of euthanasia , to other issues around guardianship/who can make decisions on the patients ' behalf , etc. 
  you can have opinions on all of these things , but please do n't pretend it 's a simple issue and that you 've got it all worked out and that everyone who disagrees with you is unethical , an idiot , or a zealot . 
   which is more moral or ethical ? 
  keep someone in some semi-vegetative state where the said person knows he/she will be in pain 24/7 and will crap him/herself 3 times a day without being able to do anything about it ? 
  you 're approaching the issue from a utilitarian perspective though . 
  not everyone believes that the ethical justification for an act is derived solely from it 's consequences .
