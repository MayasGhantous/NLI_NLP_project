  the point of representative democracy is that the representatives are supposed to represent the * interests * of that community , and that requires a judgement call sometimes . 
  i 'd like to see more of what you guys are doing in this thread : your own language followed by an english translation . 
  ultimately in communities like this there * does * need to be a common language and english is the best choice for it , but at the same time it 'd be nice to see more of the linguistic variety in europe on this subreddit . 
  easy choice for them if they 're forced to make it . 
  france are n't that important in the grand scheme of things . 
  it 's not that it 's incompatible . 
  the fact that the problem has grown to the extent that a ban is being considered is supposed to show that the model is n't working as well as hoped . 
   `` we are a left-wing government . 
  if we have to choose between a default to the imf or a default to our own people , it is a no-brainer , '' said a senior official . 
  massive respect to syriza for that . 
  the worst thing that could happen is for syriza to abandon its promises to the greek people as that would lead to the golden dawn winning power . 
  right , it 's about having a balance and that 's not something that has easy answers that can be condensed into upvoteable soundbites . 
  we want politicians to come from a variety of backgrounds , so to do that we need to be able to pay them such that those who are poorer are not disadvantaged by taking on this role . 
  but you 're right , we also do n't want to pay them too much because otherwise it attracts the wrong sort of people . 
  it 's just one of those things countries need to keep returning to , looking at the evidence , and improving as time goes on . 
  i really do n't know where i stand on this guy . 
  it 's hard to tell what he believes or whether his policies are good or bad . 
  the accusation against this ` jobs bill ' is that it reduces workers rights - but might it be the case that workers have too much power at the moment ? 
  italy is not very competitive on the international market at the moment . 
  it could be that doing business in italy is just not as cost-effective as elsewhere . 
  the eu act with no morality or compassion towards greece . 
  they fuck greece 's people over by forcing failed austerity measures on them that destroy their economy and force millions of greeks into the streets , cause suicide rates to rise by 35 % , unemployment to hit almost 30 % , youth unemployment over 60 % , and force hundreds of thousands of greeks into poverty . 
  then the eu acts all shocked and offended when greece turns to countries who appear to * actually * be willing to help them . 
  the entire eu plan for greece is `` it puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again . '', 
  `` either you voluntarily destroy your economy and sacrifice the most vulnerable in your society or we allow your entire country to collapse . 
  do n't attempt to stand up to us . '', 
  i 'm on my phone but see if you can find anything by richard wolff on the mondragon corporation , the biggest co-op in spain . 
  he 's a marxist professor in the us but his main concern is bringing democracy into the economy via the promotion of workers owning and having democratic control over their businesses . 
  except that simply is n't true , the greek government have made sweeping cuts to their budget every year since the crisis , to the point where they 're now running a yearly budget surplus . 
  yeah , believing one 's opinion is right is literally islamism, 
   if le fn had a fresh face as their leader , i think they would have done better than bringing all the baggage that comes with a `` le pen '' last name . 
  i do n't agree . 
  marine le pen has been a very , very effective leader for the fn . 
  i find it hard to imagine they could have found a better one . 
  in the uk it 's pretty well-known that [ immigrants contribute more in taxes than they receive in social services ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24813467 ) . 
  they `` go '' to sweden because sweden are the only ones in the eu pulling their weight . 
  these people do need help but most countries in the eu , including the uk , do not play our part in helping them . 
  sweden does which is why they have more asylum seekers . 
  [ mfw people living in one of the most highly-developed countries on the planet , where all their material needs are met and with plentiful access to the education and training necessary to advance their station in life complain that life is `` hopeless '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/il3wipv.gifv ), 
  as i 've come to expect , a thread full of people refusing to believe the evidence that crimea could * possibly * want to be part of russia . 
  58 % of them are ethnic russians and 77 % consider russian to be their native language , only about 10 % consider ukrainian to be . 
  terrible idea . 
  reminds me of this story : [ ` russian man shot in quarrel over immanuel kant 's philosophy ' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-man-shot-in-quarrel-over-immanuel-kants-philosophy-8820327.html ), 
  the empire never ended , we just got smarter and revised our tactics ... 
   if you support this you must support the uk leaving the eu okay, 
  the hypocrisy is unbelievable . 
  when it comes to greece there 's total strictness on all debts , but when the spotlight is turned on you lot suddenly you all want to have a big philosophical discussion about how long it takes before you might be able to get away with not paying your debts . 
  no , but it 's a pretty big way of saying `` go fuck yourselves '', 
  it 's not about the baseline rate , it 's about the change and the cause of it . 
  maybe not but i do n't think many germans on this subreddit are being very fair to greeks and their outlook either . 
  germans are very happy with the eu 's economic policies which benefit them while disadvantaging greece , so when greece fails it 's very easy for them to swan around wagging their fingers at the greeks . 
  were their tax-collection , corruption , and over-spending problems ? 
  yes , of course , and the greeks have done a really rather marvelous job of reforming their system since then - [ more than any other country in the eu ] ( http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/reforms-bloody-reforms.html ) , actually , including portugal , spain , and ireland - and have long been running a budget surplus . 
  but the economy is collapsing because of the austerity being enforced on them . 
   right after their elections , they claimed that their politics would be one that was aimed at benefitting all europeans while solving this crisis . 
  their narrative was that the true problem was not the behaviour of the majority of greeks or germans but their failed tax system , immoral behaviour of the wealthy few and ** a crisis-policy directed at bailing out banks instead of helping the common european citizen . 
  ** it 's the same now though . 
  that 's still what they 're saying , and it 's still what they 're trying to tackle , * particularly * that last bit which i bolded - that 's the crux of the issue , but germany and the rest of western europe are unwilling to come to the table on the issue of loans and debt repayment . 
   what we have now is a greek government threatening to confiscate private property for perceived un-claimed debts of world war fucking two . 
  i do not think they really understand how god damn offensive this is to us , especially to those of us who would have whole-heartedly supported them in any policies which helped greece and its citizens . 
  i 'll still support these policies if they 're sensible , even against my own government and many of my compatriots . 
  but what they have done right now is alienating just about everyone . 
  maybe it is offensive , but the german government were n't willing to co-operate in the first place so from the greek perspective they were simply looking for some leverage to try and get germany to co-operate . 
  same reason why earlier today they made the point that they do n't think the eu realise what would happen if greece just let the immigrants flood into europe , especially as the eu have done absolutely sweet fuck-all to help greece or italy deal with that problem . 
  maybe it is alienating , but when your gdp has fallen by 25 % , your unemployment rising by the same amount , suicide rising 30 % , with almost 6-7 million greeks living at or below the poverty line , * yeah you do whatever it takes to try and put an end to this . 
  it 's completely one-sided . 
  look at any of the popular comments in the current threads discussing greece [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ynn0x/greece_warns_that_it_may_begin_confiscating/ ) , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ynlm1/greek_govt_to_confiscate_goethe_institute/ ) , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2yol0h/anger_at_greeces_threat_to_unleash_wave_of/ ) , or especially [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2yo6ok/dear_fellow_europeans_what_do_you_think_of_the/ ) where we * really * get / r/europe 's opinion on greece . 
  the opinion is very clear : greeks must continue to die in the streets until the debt is repaid . 
  if they can not repay the debt then they will be given more loans and more austerity until they can . 
  this challenges the dominant narrative on / r/europe , which is why the link is at 8 points with 30 votes in total and only 2 comments . 
  nobody here wants to hear that maybe varoufakis is right , that maybe austerity is n't the best way forward , that * maybe * if they want to get * any * of their money back then forcing greece into bankruptcy and a default are n't great ideas : they just want their pre-existing prejudices reinforced . 
  greeks = bad and they need to be punished until they are no longer bad . 
  it continues to pay back its debts by having its economy destroyed or it gets the hose again . 
  dangerous move sticking up for greece on / r/europe , expect downvotes . 
  it was austerity . 
  corruption did n't help , but there 's a causal link between the austerity and deteriorating conditions in greece . 
  try to tell a person dying in the streets of athens that `` it 's okay , at least you 're not in somalia ! '', 
  2.5 million greeks are living below the poverty line , another 3.8 mil are at real risk of falling below it ( and if these cuts continue then they * will * fall below it ) , and child poverty has risen from 23 % in 2008 to 40.5 % in 2014 . 
  homelessness was over 20,000 in 2013 , with 9,000 in athens alone , and has only gotten worse since . 
  greece has more people living below the poverty line than any other country in the eurozone . 
  this is not a laughing matter , and it is not hyperbole . 
  germany 's disastrous economic policies are killing greek people who had nothing to do with the corrupt officials and tax-dodging elites . 
  this is not just wage cuts and higher taxes , people are literally dying on the streets because of these policies . 
  it 's a pipe dream at best , a dystopia at worst . 
  the alternative to what syriza is asking for is that millions of greeks will be pushed into poverty and death . 
  greece 's economy will eventually go bankrupt as long as merkel has her way and they 'll have to default while part of the eu , which will decimate the eurozone . 
  it 's in our own interests to help greece . 
  what syriza want is really very reasonable . 
  they want to write off a proportion of the debt ( which will never be paid back anyway ) and renegotiate the terms on which the rest is paid back - they 've been running a budget surplus for years now , getting public spending under control is no longer an issue in greece.the issue is that * as a result * of the austerity policies foisted upon greece their gdp has shrunk by 25 % , unemployment has risen by 25 % , and suicide has risen by 30 % . 
  do you * honestly * think you 're going to get your money back at this rate ? 
  really ? 
  because you wo n't . 
  if the eu refuse to budge then greece will default , it 's simply a matter of time . 
  oh and then golden dawn will grow in popularity . 
  the concept of a far-right party growing after economic turmoil and a perceived sense of injustice is something i would expect germans to be very sensitive to . 
  the only way greece will start to be able to fix the mess caused by the troika 's unworkable policies is if their economy can grow again and they can look after their citizens properly , and that ca n't happen without a renegotiation of the terms . 
  and if you can honestly listen to tsipras and the other leaders of syriza , and look at the policies they want to implement , and tell me that they want to repeat past mistakes then i really do n't know what to tell you other than that you 're simply prejudiced against greeks . 
  and now they need to be punished for electing representative who lied to them and stole from them ? 
  germany is the one destroying greece . 
  i 'm getting really sick of the villifcation of greece in germany .
