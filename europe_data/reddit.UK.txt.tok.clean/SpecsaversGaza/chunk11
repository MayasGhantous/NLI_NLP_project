  `` fortress europa '' , `` bloc of doom '' or even `` your name here '' ? 
  it could also mean 95.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 % . 
  3,999,999 non-german speakers seem like a lot , perhaps their first tongue is shared with many here ; pedantry . 
  4 million non-german speakers seems a lot though . 
  95 % for germany ? 
  how so ? 
  it 's a farce . 
  that the eu is solely and uniquely responsible for peace across europe . 
  a.k.a we prefer to do all our corruption via london in english ... 
  that 's quite waffly . 
  no not at all . 
  you 're totally misrepresenting what i 've actually said to rather lazily haul out some cliches . 
  so it 's a highlight , of a debatable point , rather than a `` promotion of peace '' ? 
  so this peace in europe for decades thanks to the eu is a myth ? 
  that 's just saying it 's a goal . 
  i 'm asking how flying that flag promotes peace , and gaining downvotes rather than an answer . 
  can anyone actually give an answer ? 
  serious , if contrarian , question ... 
  specifically who are `` we '' ? 
  i 'm beginning to think we need an entry test for this subreddit . 
  he 's naive if he believes the power lies with the political establishment . 
  i believe that 's his plan . 
  monica bellucci 's bedroom , pref . 
  when cassel is n't home ... 
  that 's quite awful . 
  possibly the low point of all this wwi cobblers , but there 's plenty of time for it to get worse . 
  try this : http://hola.org/, 
  i 'm supporting the protestors . 
  why post this here ? 
  going to share similar posters from other european nations ? 
  it 's no weirder than claiming a flag as a symbol of 100 % peace over decades across a continent when it 's not the case . 
  because it failed to deliver peace during the yugoslav wars . 
  my misunderstanding on your flag point , apologies . 
  i know of the council of europe . 
  there 's still an argument that when chruchill wrote and spoke of a united europe he meant mainland europe and not the uk , but i 'm not sure how true that might be and it 's a tangent . 
  well not 100 % peaceful rather proves my point . 
  to be honest i do n't think rating them does anything but look inhumane , at worst , and something not so harsh at best . 
  i find flag draped sentiment disagreeable , and wanted to show how the idea of a piece of cloth having delivered peace was incorrect , which you do agree with so it 's me and you against the world !, 
   good points but i still suggest it 's borne of the people prior to any input from the politicos . 
  the people were n't going to go through that again , it 's our collective humanity in force , which organisations can only weakly reflect , while claiming as much responsibility for it , and rather shamefully , as they can . 
  solid and thoughtful response , thanks . 
  it 's an irritant we share ... 
  yes , they are willing messengers . 
  ahhh well you 're rewriting the myth , which is commonly '' ... delivered peace in europe for 60 years ... '' , although i do prefer '' ... unfortunately the eu could n't help ... '' it 's more honest . 
  it 's in europe , these are all our countires are they not ? 
  nederlands , and often better than many of our compatriots . 
  you 're letting biased media with an agenda not only flavour your opinion so easily but also taint a nation in it 's entirity ? 
  stephen ambrose suggested how the two world wars might well become known as the european civil war so you 'll get no disagreement from me on that nor a taste for war . 
  it 's the replacement of nationalist myths , typically flag based , for a federalist myth based on a flag . 
  it 's supposedly a more agreeable myth , but not for me . 
  the yugoslav wars did happen , however inconvenient , and ukraine is n't doing too grandly , and just about every eu member state was part of isaf . 
  the reason why there 's little taste for fighting in the rest of europe is down just to the people , not governments . 
  even if our governments tried to get us to fight each other we simply would n't do it , we 'd refuse due largely to the wars last century but also becuase we socialise amongst ourselves and we quite like each other . 
  the credit for this is misplaced in a piece of cloth or a government , it 's due to the people . 
  that 's an acknowledgement rather than a promotion . 
  what about the yugoslav wars or even ukraine ? 
  well this is the `` torygraph '' after all they thrive on putting the `` ghastly foreigner in his place '' , not least when supporting the tories in their pr stunts to claim back ukip voters . 
  i do wonder how far they might want to push this ... would they insist russia flew the hammer and sickle , or even germany the flag of the third reich at ww2 commemorations ? 
  no it 's not , that 's the same self serving myth making which the politico 's use these commemorations for . 
  always easy to forget yugoslavia of course ... and deployments with isaf . 
  what short memories folk have . 
  citizens of ex-yugoslavia might disagree . 
  it 's like a mirror image of the daily mail , only `` progressive '' . 
  ... or even remind british hand-wringers of the yugoslav wars and financial chaos in countries like greece . 
  it 's not supposed to be about either though is it ? 
  the clue is in the date ... 
  how is flying that flag promoting peace ? 
  quite , but it is pandering to a religious clique in it 's extremism . 
  it 's disturbing to see a british court supporting any religious nonsense . 
  it 's also a dreadful waste of bacon . 
  but they did n't . 
  that 's a fallacious argument . 
  he ca n't prove it though can he ? 
  does the infant claim expenses ? 
  let 's not forget all the other taxes , property , v.a.t. , duty on alcohol , etc. 
  that 's a long way for a german to drive for prostitutes though ... 
  maybe they count the illegal immigrants too ? 
  poland - ten points . 
  why have you editorialised the headline from `` economist says european jews overreacting to anti-semitism '' ? 
  were n't various parties talking about reform to challenge the growth of the anti-eu vote ? 
  having a federalist in charge is not the way to meet that challenge . 
  shooting foreigners , esp . 
  those from third world countries . 
  have n't the heart for it . 
  quite . 
  i think it does matter so we can see the facts , otherwise it 's little more than a guess . 
  i 'd already seen the herald story and that does n't have them either . 
  i do think if they have paperwork they should share it so we can see for ourselves . 
  that said this is just the wonderful world of politics , i imagine the snp try similar , they 'd be fools if they did n't . 
  are there any actual sources for this story ? 
  by force ? 
  what with guns , artillery and all that ? 
  i 'd have thought these veterans were too damn old . 
  they do n't claim asylum in the first eu country they enter . 
  apologies , i misunderstood you . 
  because it 's on the way home from the pub . 
   best iskender can be found in bursa or istanbul problem being how that is n't on the way home from the pub . 
  no worries , it 's an interesting subject which deserves thought and a fair number of words . 
   but what they mean , at least to me , is putting ones own self interest , and perhaps sense of self preservation , a primal instinct , aside , for what you view as the greater good . 
  then is is as true of the axis as the allies surely ?
