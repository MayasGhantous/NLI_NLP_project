  if they want to send a skilled bomb maker , unknown to the security services , they 'll take great care to see he arrives safely as he 's both important and worth a great deal to them . 
  there 's plenty of available history about terrorist groups , have a look at folk like the raf/baader-meinhof , black september organization or ira , they 've had members travel internationally and never in such a haphazard or dangerous manner . 
  it 's risk enough to do it as is , why would they add more risks to it ? 
  the most regular efforts for folk to hide amongst refugees have been efforts to evade capture following defeat , most famously many nazi war criminals , when there has been no other choice . 
  this entire isis posing as refugees ideas has two basic foundations : the main one is fear-mongering from the far-right . 
  they do n't like muslims and would like for everyone else not to like muslims either , often for political gain , so suggest that muslims are terrorist savages bent on destroying our culture and people . 
  the lesser one stems from cameron 's visit to lebanon in spetember when the lebanese education minister elias bou saab claimed he had a `` gut-feeling '' that as many as two per cent of refugees could be ` radicals ' . 
  where this was reasonably reported it was also mentioned how this was speculation and he had no evidence to support such a claim . 
  here 's it 's reported well : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-refugee-agency-slams-claims-that-1-in-50-syrians-fleeing-conflict-are-members-of-isis-10502860.html ... and here too : http://metro.co.uk/2015/09/15/lebanon-minister-has-gut-feeling-one-in-50-syrian-refugees-could-be-isis-terrorists-5391888/ . . and here what it 's been mutated to in a bid to sell more papers : http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/officials-warn-20000-isis-jihadis-6443516 now if there really were 20,000 daesh in those camps it would be safe to expect some attacks within lebanon , but there have n't been any . 
  when daesh massed on lebanon 's border to attack hezbollah back in june those 20,000 could have attacked from within lebanon and they would have routed hezbollah , not least by weight of numbers as the fighting around ras baalbek did n't involve much more than a couple of thousand on both sides combined . 
  instead daesh suffered big losses and their local `` emir '' was killed . 
  there 's a great danger of doing daesh 's job for them if we 're going to start to fear muslims , or a percentage of muslims , or refugees , or a fraction of refugees for being fifth columnists because daesh have claimed that in their propaganda . 
  . . and i 've just remembered that danish intelligence did indeed make a statement about this : http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/jihadists-not-detected-on-refugee-routes-to-eu-danish-intelligence-1.2361779 good riddance to the dogs !, 
   * edits for spelling, 
  what 's the branch of italian cooking called something like `` cucina blanco '' ? 
  magical . 
  the kurds have claimed isis numbers higher than anyone else : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/war-with-isis-islamic-militants-have-army-of-200000-claims-kurdish-leader-9863418.html the intelligence agencies do n't really talk to the public , it 's not really their thing , so it 's no surprise we have n't heard anything from them . 
  i expect there 's been a few heavy reports landing on government desks though . 
  mi5 spends around 65 % of it 's budget on international terrorism , and 15 % on northern ireland ( out of around # 1,883 m ) so they 're obviously doing something but it 's impossible , for obvious reasons , to know what and how effective they are at stopping attacks . 
  failure tends to attract more publicity and success often ca n't be too widely or completely broadcast if it 's part of an ongoing campaign . 
  it 's a certainty that more terrorist attacks will be planned but whether they might happen is anyone 's guess . 
  those who would harm us will use any method available but i think there 's as much danger possible from someone landing totally legally at heathrow as someone coming illegally . 
  seriously if you had highly motivated and reasonably trained jihadists set to do some vital mission would you risk them on a rickety boat , or ending up stuck in a refugee centre ? 
  i 'd want to guarantee them arriving safely and thus increasing their chances of doing what they 're sent to do . 
  out of all of this crisis i thik the biggest danger is the most underreported element , the people smugglers . 
  they 've build a criminal industry worth billions , treat the displaced people appallingly , sometimes deliberately capsizing boats , and yet barely get a mention . 
  who ? 
  who ? 
  brother why not start a thread for dead ` uns ? 
  that is quite stunning imagery , reminds me of hr giger . 
  well let 's hope so , to me it did sound grim . 
  yep . 
  is n't it a bit chilly over the next six months for camping ? 
  that 's an agreeable development is n't it ? 
  yes a whole nation is feebled-minded by being from that very nation . 
  are you from / r/european ? 
  that 's appalling , what the hell did they think they 're doing ffs . 
  mutti would look much better in purdah . 
  no typically they delete them . 
  `` hippies dead , hipsters next . '', 
  why would you house refugees in fire stations ? 
  if the father 's name is n't on the relevant birth certificate you 're very unlikely to trace him . 
  is it too late to ask the grandparent what their name was ? 
  we could do with a new owner of essex , it could only get better . 
  although a red jagged line looks impressive i do n't think the med can be seen as a fortification , and it does n't seem to be stopping folk crossing it . 
  i 'd be impressed if there were photos of these fortifications . 
  i doubt there are any . 
  oh you norwegians and your civilised way of doing things . 
  i 'd be careful waving the h-word around mate . 
  the best of luck to the workers . 
   downright violence is unacceptable and should be met with downright violence . 
  ftfy, 
  thanks for the info . 
  part of me thinks it 's a shame because of their historical value , but a larger part of me understands why - even though i never had to live under soviet control . 
  congratulations one and all . 
   `` canada is basicaly europe on another continent . '', 
  i prefer to think of it as the mexico of the north . 
  so they have gone then ? 
  this might give you a rough idea : http://en.immostreet.com/france/metz-4837482/sale/apartment#querydata=search_type%3d3,5,10,12%26property_type_id%3d1%26sort%3d0%26sort02%3d0%26place_id%3d4837482%26page%3d0%26precedent_page%3d, 
  i 'm perfectly serious and thanks for the gold . 
  as / u/danskjack suggests it may have a greater value . 
  to reassure you here 's some examples of french prices using that way of doing things : https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/05/bb/a9/05bba972db4f5852f1d13d1fae9811f2.jpg http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ndgwwdy0ma==/z/4tgaaoswf1dumqki/$_35.jpg less seriously i believe the french adopted this purely to confuse the english . 
  it 's quite usual for mainland europe to use a '' . '', 
  where others might use a '' , '' and vice versa . 
  so 95.000 euro is ninety-five thousand and 152.500,00 is one hundred and fifty-two thousand and five hundred . 
  lend me a fifty ? 
  everyone knows they should go in recycling . 
  a pearl of a nation !, 
  that 's shameful , you do n't claim the high ground by crawling under a rock . 
  yes but each and every dollar poland spends is far more aggressive ... 
  country : uk favourite neighbour : english channel least favourite neighbour : north sea, 
  you really should give us some more information , like your career , age , and whether you have any family ties to any of the eu states . 
  but you do n't look a day over 21 . , 
  you 're not the only one fella ... , 
  no , i really do n't care . 
  it 's still happening , i 'm just across the water from calais and go there regularly . 
  very little has changed i assure you . 
  just the other day some poor soul was found dead by the channel tunnel entrance . 
  eg : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34399729 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-what-life-is-really-like-inside-the-jungle-in-calais-a6674256.html http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34388412, 
  i do n't believe it has especially slowed , and it 's been ongoing for over a decade . 
  the main disruption to travel across the channel was , as it most often is , industrial action . 
  with the gendarmerie trying to police that it made the usual policing concerning displaced folk a lot thinner . 
  the main joy of the calais situation for the media was just how simple it is to cover , a london based hack can be there in around three hours even if they take the ferry , they can do their story , have a great lunch in the town , pick up some cheap tobacco and booze and be home in time for dinner . 
   also , that area there has had ceaseless in-fighting for thousands of years . 
  well europes like that ... 
  they 'll have to find it on a map first . 
  so long as daesh do n't form a cricket team ... 
  it went on holiday . 
  i do n't share your taste for predicting who might join , but it 's not just the euro though is it ? 
  http://www.the-eu-and-me.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/diagram-eu-org.jpg which of the states in that diagram are in or out , and to which fraction ? 
  i 'm not sure the next european debt crisis will show stability . 
  but the brits would , so ... 
   you are half-out now . 
  that a myth , and a popular one , but little more . 
  there are plenty of member states not fully in , and it works fine . 
  imposition or compulsion towards any of them to do anything they choose not too is n't the way forward . 
  any planned negotiation after a referendum is playing into the hands of the `` out '' camp . 
  dave wants to be seen to negotiate to boost the `` in '' campaign . 
  whether he actually negotiates anything of substance does n't matter . 
  you lucky lucky b. . .
