  [ it says here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_refugee_population ) that the uk has 139,519 refugees in its population , which equals 319 natives per refugee . 
  the netherlands has 74,598 refugees in its population , which equals 222 natives per refugee . 
  they 're both extraordinary numbers , but they 're nothing compared to germany , which has 571,685 refugees . 
  i 'm sure the netherlands is suffering , but it does n't have any problems that are n't just as prominent elsewhere . 
  i do n't think it 's a competition to decide which country is doing the worst . 
  they 're all a mess right now , anyway . 
  your source claims that the population density of netherlands was 442 in 1990 . 
  i have n't found any other websites with those numbers , so i doubt their veracity . 
  either way , the low countries and england , as well as many other countries in western europe are suffering greatly from population density issues . 
  that , we can agree on . 
  population density of uk = 225/km2 population density of england = 413/km2, 
  it 's quite hard to find statistics specifically england , because you usually see the uk . 
  the other three countries offset the results . 
  over 1/5 of the uk live in london , so it 's the main culprit , but liverpool , manchester and birmingham are also very dense places . 
  the netherlands and belgium are behind england in terms of population density . 
  but yes , they 're both suffering from the same population difficulties . 
  england is the most densely populated country in the eu apart from malta . 
  we 're struggling to hold our own country together . 
  there 's very little we can spare . 
  lesbos is actually where the word lesbians comes from . 
  in fact , i believe they once tried to sue all the lesbians in the world for stealing their word . 
  or something . 
  after this week , i have a hunger for drama . 
  euro drama is even jucier than reddit drama . 
  plus , it would be incredible to see a greek exit . 
  that 's history , right there . 
  it 's one of the few reasons i wanted scotland to leave the uk . 
  we do n't live through as many big historical moments now as people used to . 
  so they were badly cleaned in britain . 
  but the ones ( like half of them ) that are all broken up got that way in greece . 
  any more ? 
  have we damaged them before ? 
  i do n't understand why people want more land for their countries . 
  why ? 
  what do you get out of it ? 
  we 'll have to dry our tears by violently rubbing our faces all over the elgin marbles . 
  then why are some of the world 's most famous chefs british ? 
  rome will always be amazing architecturally , culturally and historically . 
  people really seem to love paris ... until they go to paris . 
  you say that like it 's out of the ordinary, 
  according to the [ global terrorism index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_terrorism_index ) , the us has a higher level of terrorist activity than ireland , belgium , netherlands , denmark , france , spain , portugal , germany , italy , austria and switzerland . 
  in fact , the only country in western europe with a higher terrorism index than the us is the uk . 
  and in the last decade , the uk has had one islamist attack , being woolwich ( 22 may 2013 ) , whereas the us has 8 , listed here : san bernardino ( 2 december 2015 ) , garland ( 3 may 2015 ) , new york ( 23 october 2014 ) , herat ( 13 september 2013 ) , boston ( 15 april 2013 ) , benghazi ( 11 september 2012 ) , fort hood ( 5 november 2009 ) , little rock ( 1 june 2009 ) ,, 
  i could n't find any comparable information for europe , but i did find a wiki of [ intentional homicide by country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#by_country ) , and this includes the us states . 
  vermont has a homicide rate of 1.3 , and hawaii sits at 2.1 . 
  of the 28 eu member states , 19 are below vermont in homicide , and 23 are below hawaii . 
  so basically , ** they 're not safer than europe . 
  ** and keep in mind that vermont and hawaii are some of the safest states in the country . 
  do you have any statistics to support the claim that vermont and hawaii are safer than europe ? 
  also the part where literally every comment chain in / r/worldnews is turned into a conversation about the us . 
  it 's not much better , but here , at least most of the people in the discussion are * actually * relevant to the discussion . 
  ... but it 's worldnews ... 
  i do n't really see it as an attack on england , but i would still expect british people and authorities to give all the support they could . 
  it 's still colossally safer than travelling in the us , at any rate, 
  the uk does not want to invade ireland and has no reason to do so . 
  both governments are satisfied with their current borders and for the most part , the people of northern ireland and rep. ireland are happy with the borders . 
  why would they change ? 
  well there 's no rules saying the european union has to be a union of separate countries . 
  and you 're probably right , if it became a country , it would probably be gradual rather than all at once , so the eu would probably keep its name . 
  i prefer the name `` european federation '' nowadays , including the words `` united '' and `` states '' together in a country name leaves a bad taste . 
  i can only assume they were discussing the highly anticipated eurovision 2016, 
  that 's awful . 
  is it a stereotype that british people whine about stereotypes ? 
  i thought everyone did that . 
  especially irish people , about whom stereotypes are not often complementary . 
  maybe . 
  but the uk-europe views in the video are based on contemporary political stances , whereas the others are all based on old stereotypes , so i think they 're guaranteed to be more divisive . 
  1:23 - british , and i do n't think it 's very accurate . 
  the `` how the uk views continental europe '' one is a more divided view than the others ( lots of us actually like europe ) , but most of them are very correct . 
  looks vaguely like dale from [ the hobbit ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/b/b5/naamloos.png/revision/latest?cb=20130706141650 ), 
  mel gibson will be the death of us all, 
  all the filthier with you in it , my dear , 
  british - eu - world, 
  i do n't know what it is with people thinking the scottish as a whole want to leave , and that we forced them to stay . 
  they chose to stay . 
  that said , i expect things might not go the same if they voted again , after all of cameron 's bullshit in the last year . 
  i like our flag , our history , our healthcare , our tea and our queen . 
  i do not like our government . 
  i take pride in bring british and english but i would n't call myself patriotic , because that 's a bit too much for me . 
  i 've always seen unquestioning patriotism as crass . 
  / r/worldnews is dark and full of terrors ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ americans, 
  you 're the online equivalent of the guy who holds up a *** `` the world will end tomorrow '' *** sign every single day and then says `` i told you so '' when it finally happens . 
  she 's messed up a lot in immigration , but in many areas of her work , she 's still very accomplished . 
  cold is a relative term , i think . 
  my computer wants to correct menorca to menorah ? 
  menorca was the first place i ever visited outside of england . 
  it holds a very special place in my heart , and it 's such a beautiful place . 
  though i did n't actually know it was an island in the middle of the mediterranean until a decade later . 
  i had thought it was literally * right * next to spain . 
  that was a revelation . 
  this fiasco has made it quite clear that paying attention to petitions is barely a formality to the mps . 
  they do n't care . 
  i do n't see why i 'm obligated to approve of america 's actions . 
  i do n't always disagree with them , but i often do , and i give my reasons for doing so . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  and frankly , it 's expected for me to condemn most of america 's actions , because my values contrast heavily with american ones . 
  and i 'm on a site where most posts relate in some way to america , so those opinions are going to come up often , especially since i like talking about sociological and political things , where america tends to come up a lot . 
  even on / r/europe , apparently . 
  when i find something i want to talk about that is n't related to america , i talk about it . 
  i also comment on books and europe and things i find funny .
