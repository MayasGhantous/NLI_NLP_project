  i want the eu to be a federal country ( despite my country voting to leave it ) , but i accept that even a european federation may be impossible because of the differences . 
  hell , many countries within the eu are struggling to hold themselves together , such as the uk , spain and belgium , because even at that level , the differences can be too significant . 
  i see a european federation as possible and beneficial because most european countries have a lot in common , despite their differences , and are already heavily integrated , and they are more powerful together than individually . 
  but a global union of countries is just too much . 
  and often , countries have the most conflicted histories with their closest cultural neighbours . 
  china , taiwan , japan and korea would never accept a shared sovereign . 
  turkey and greece would never accept it . 
  palestine , israel , jordan , saudi arabia and iran would never accept it . 
  there 's too much bad blood there . 
  unless we meet a pantheon of alien races like in mass effect , and the earth suddenly becomes a lot smaller . 
  but that 's very unlikely . 
  i do n't geberally buy anything made in the us , but i suppose i would make an effort to boycot them if trump abandons the paris accord . 
  but it 's more important to boycott american brands than american made products , which woulf be more difficult . 
  i do n't know what 's legal and illegal in america . 
  seriously though , do you prefer czechia/czechian or czech republic or czech or what ? 
  this one confuses me . 
  i 've heard french people called franks , but usually only by older people . 
  i 'm british and i usually hear ` british person ' or ` brit ' , almost never ` briton ' . 
  i have no idea what parliament is doing most of the time so this is n't out of the ordinary . 
  * the * high court , i suppose . 
  or at least , in the uk . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37704117 ) some more information on that whole thing if you 're interested . 
  i suppose the us equivalent might be the supreme court , but i do n't know enough about either court to say for sure . 
  not at all . 
  during times of war , the cabinet is afforded much more power to act immediately and independently . 
  in times of peace , most things have to pass through the houses of commons and lords . 
  in fact , we saw this recently . 
  theresa may wants to activate article 50 , which will take the uk out of europe , without putting it to a parliamentary vote , because she knows parliament would oppose it . 
  so it 's been taken to the high court and it will set a precedent on how much power the pm has to act on her own . 
  [ more information here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-british_union#world_war_ii_.281940.29 ), 
  it 's roots are steeped in religion , but as you say , the us did a remarkable job of leaching out all of the tradition and replacing it with commercialisation . 
  yes , but it 's gradually been ruined by american commercialisation . 
  there 's a huge amount of tradition in the uk surrounding halloween , considering it started here , but almost all of it has been lost or distorted in some way . 
  following the loss of the battle of france , the uk almost combined with france into a single country . 
  it was supported by de gaulle , churchill and reynaud . 
  the two countries would share citizenship , foreign trade , currency , war cabinet and military command . 
  the final declaration went like so * ` france and great britain shall no longer be two nations , but one franco-british union . 
  the constitution of the union will provide for joint organs of defence , foreign , financial and economic policies . 
  every citizen of france will enjoy immediately citizenship of great britain , every british subject will become a citizen of france . 
  ' * however , many french leaders were suspicious , that this was a british attempt to steal their colonies and turn france into a dominion . 
  the french cabinet ended up opposing the idea and formed a new government on the evening of the ratification , and the new government asked germany for an armistice . 
  i come from shrewsbury , which functioned in the medieval era as a market town between wales and england .

  it 's good to * us * , being me and the people immediately surrounding me . 
  i ca n't speak for the northerners . 
  where i am , there have been no floods and rainfall has , if anything , lessened . 
  for the time being , climate change is being good to us . 
  summers have become very hot and winter has ceased to exist . 
  of course , that 's not great for the flora and fauna here , and it will probably take a nosedive for us very soon , because our weather is so strongly affected by the gulf and jet streams . 
  is n't tetra pak incredibly harmful to the environment ? 
  it 's uncommon to see bagged milk here , but i understand the mentality behind it . 
  there are many ways in which it 's more convenient , more eco friendly , easier to transport , etc. 
  most milk here comes in [ plastic bottles ] ( https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/elib_6360138.jpg ) , but you can also get it in cartons . 
  though it 's worth noting that cartons pretty much always have a cap , never without . 
  i 'd recommend aberdeen or inverness over glasgow personally . 
  but edinburgh is incredible . 
  london and paris . 
  if there was a third , i would throw in rome . 
  australia . 
  i 'd say canada but it 's a bit close to the us for my tastes . 
  like those pricks who get their crisps at waitrose . 
  i live 10km or so from the border between england and wales , if that counts ? 
  the official powers remain from a time when they could actually be used . 
  no one 's removed them , out of respect for the queen , out of respect for tradition and history , and because it 's redundant to remove powers which are never used anyway . 
  but as the queen never uses her powers , it would be a dramatic event for her to try , and it 's believed that neither the government , nor the public , would be very happy with it at all . 
  it would force the national debate of even having a monarchy , and would at least result in those powers being taken away . 
  if she tried too hard to force anything , it would end the monarchy as well . 
  tl : dr she has powers , but trying to use them would probably end the monarchy . 
  it 's because they 're all so old . 
  any house built in the last few decades will have double glazing . 
  some have heated bathrooms . 
  i still miss it . 
  you ca n't find it anywhere in the uk, 
  i always thought the generic ` coffee ' of the uk is a flat white ? 
  really ? 
  i always found the coffee in america was weak as shit . 
  that 's what the uk , germany and france are for . 
  i 'm from the uk and carpeted bathrooms are completely new to me . 
  that 's why most of the world does n't use it . 
  that 's a very good point . 
  in terms of soft power , i ca n't think of anyone on earth with more . 
  but as you say , she has a long list of impressive official powers , and using them would end her monarchy . 
  now that we 've had the brexit referendum , i doubt i even need to say it . 
  the huge cultural divide between young and old was one of the most defining factors of the vote , as well as the anger that followed . 
  young people in this country are usually ( i know there are always outliers ) very different politically than their parents , not just in a left-right stance , but also when it comes to how they identify on a national , continental or global scale . 
  you will usually find that most people under 25 in this country identify heavily with europe , and the eu , and many will call themselves global citizens . 
  over 65s , by contrast , are very strongly english in an almost primitively territorial way . 
  under 25s usually vilify war , infringements of privacy and strict rules on identity , whereas over 65s are often open to the idea of foreign intervention , believe that security trumps privacy in most respects , and adopt a very traditionalist view of most things . 
  under 25s are generally very collectivist , and therefore support things like the nhs , welfare , council housing , humanitarian aid , etc , whereas over 65s tend to adopt a more individualistic culture . 
  i could go on and on and on . 
  basically whatever view the old adopt , the young usually hold the exact opposite . 
  regardless , the differences have sort of boiled beneath the surface for a decade or so now , but as they were largely benign , there was no massive upheaval . 
  however with the brexit vote , which divided the country right through the middle , we 're seeing big problems start to appear . 
  because the brexit vote is a huge change and it 's one the younger generations lost . 
  yes , most of south america is western . 
  that 's the main problem with terms like ` the west ' or ` first world ' . 
  yes . 
  to me , poland and romania are as western as canada and france . 
  but the real problem is that terms like ` western ' or ` first world ' are an outdated relic of the cold war . 
  i imagine that every country with a large english speaking population has their own variations on it .
