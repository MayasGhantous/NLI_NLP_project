  we spent a month learning about a man who died in a bog and half a year on st lucia , a.k.a the least significant country on earth . 
  maybe in your school it was , but it is n't usually ignored . 
  [ it 's in shropshire , almost on the border with wales . 
  ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@52.7055334,-2.7554483,15.5z ) in fact , it used to be a trading town between england and wales . 
  a river loops around the town , and the westernmost bridge is called ` welsh bridge ' and the easternmost bridge is called ` english bridge ' because they were used so predominantly for trade . 
  thank you !, 
  i live in a tiny town which is less than 2km from end to end , but inexplicably [ has ] ( http://www.castlewales.com/shrwsbry.jpg ) [ three ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/01/69/39/1693941_8f48253e.jpg ) [ castle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/shrewsbury_station.jpg ) [ looking ] ( http://www.originalshrewsbury.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/75.jpg ) [ buildings ] ( http://www.starbirthassignment.com/images/shrewsbury/img_1349.jpg ) [ and ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/shrewsburyabbey.jpg ) [ a ] ( http://www.virtual-shropshire.co.uk/highsheriffshropshire-archive/bm~pix/st-alkmunds-church~s400x400.jpg ) [ dozen ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/00/54/2005456_5bdee600.jpg ) [ churches ] ( http://www.sfhs.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/shrewsbury,%20holy%20trinity%2001.preview.jpg ) [ and ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/71/44/2714437_11808eaa.jpg ) [ cathedrals ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/04/17/33/4173386_cf587955.jpg ) [ and ] ( https://www.eatonmanorevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/english_bridge_1000x1000.jpg ) [ over ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/00/48/2004882_941b7970.jpg ) [ four ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/photos/08/78/087893_24f311b2.jpg ) [ bridges ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/kingsland_toll_bridge,_shrewsbury_-_geograph.org.uk_-_118327.jpg ) . 
  it 's a weird place . 
  i live in the working class bit of an upper class town in the uk . 
  [ most of it is very pretty . 
  the uk is very cheap right now , i 'm sure . 
  i personally desperately hope that either article 50 will not be enacted or another vote will take place , but if we 're stuck this way , it 's nice to know there may be a way off this sinking ship . 
  so you 're saying if i move to an eu country now , before article 50 is enacted , i will not have to leave ? 
  but i imagine you 're going to get a skewed response here . 
  there are probably more pro-europe brits in / r/askeurope than anti-europe brits . 
  if anything , scots are more free than the english , because they can vote on english laws , but we ca n't vote on theirs . 
  scotland is a country . 
  it 's just not an independent sovereign . 
  and the majority of scots are happy to keep it that way . 
  you 're free to call it england if you like , but you would be wrong , and people will not think highly of your intelligence . 
  the uk is a mix of germanic , romance , celtic and nordic influences . 
  i would say the english language is very romance based , though it does n't have masculine and feminine words , but our culture as a whole is based more on germanic origins . 
  i fully support a european federation, 
  10 for everyone !, 
  i love all european countries . 
  they all have negatives , but that 's what gives them personality . 
  they also all have wonderful people , cultures , languages , histories , architecture , wildlife and scenery !, 
  there are some british people who say britain is not culturally european . 
  they 're incorrect . 
  i consider myself english , i consider myself british , and i consider myself european . 
  probably rowling . 
  that 's a pretty lazy answer , but still ... 
  i would n't complain if the eu became a federation , personally . 
  i trust the eu government more than i trust the uk government . 
  i just want it to end, 
  two stereotypes that i find odd - that british people have bad teeth , since we actually have some of the best dental health in the world , and that british people have bad food . 
  admittedly , we do have bad food , but we also have lots of good food !, 
  of mice and men ( hated it ) the woman in black ( hated it with the burning passion of a thousand suns ) holes ( loved it ) macbeth ( hated it ) jekyll and hyde ( hated it ) i was not a fan of classics . 
  as a 13-15 year old , i would have preferred to read books aimed at 13-15 year olds . 
  that 's why i liked holes , and none of the others . 
  i 've never read to kill a mockingbird . 
  i actually bought it and have it on a shelf in my room , waiting to be read . 
  but i have a * lot * of books to get through . 
  i 'll reach it eventually . 
  as you can probably gather from this list , it 's well known in europe , but not considered even remotely as important as it is in the us . 
  i disagree . 
  i do n't hate americans , i hate * some * americans . 
  a tiny minority . 
  the sort of people you see being posted on / r/shitamericasays . 
  but many people , including myself , hate the us government for their corruption , hypocrisy , spying and what is often seen as warmongering . 
  what books are they ... ? 
  i 'm curious about those books ... 
  on my shelf next to me , i have oscar wilde ( irish ) , dickens ( english ) , arthur conan doyle ( english ) , jules verne ( french ) , jane austen ( english ) , grimm brothers ( german ) , bram stoker ( irish ) , h.g wells ( english ) and lewis carroll ( english ) . 
  obviously , i 'm biased towards having more english-written books because i 'm an english speaker . 
  i do n't think i 've read anything american from before 1900 . 
  i only know about poe from south park , and i 've heard of mark twain , but i have no idea what he wrote . 
  in fact , i barely recognise any of the authors on [ this list ] ( http://www.literaryhistory.com/19thc/19th_century_american.htm ) , and i myself am an author . 
  i think it 's fair to say that literature from the americas did n't really gain any popularity in europe before the beginning of the 20th century . 
  books like * of mice and men * , * to kill a mockingbird * , * great gatsby * , * catcher in the rye * , and * slaughterhouse 5 * are well known here , and i 've read a couple of them . 
  but while there are american books from the 20th century that gained popularity in europe , most of them are from the 70s onwards . 
  american literature only became omnipresent in europe in the 90s . 
  looking around my room , i can see at least 36 american authors from the last few decades , which is even to , if not higher than the number of european authors i have from the same period . 
  but once again , i 'm biased towards books written in my native language , so by ` european authors ' , i really mean ` british and irish authors ' . 
  the [ uk has dozens of accents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyyt2jmvpak ) . 
  [ as in , probably more accents than are in the entire us , but in an area smaller than california . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ugpfsp2t6k ) [ our accents tend to be associated with either location , ethnicity or class . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dabo_dcidpm ) the ` default ' accent found all over the uk is considered a link to the middle class , called ` received pronunciation ' . 
  the accent associated with more upper class people is called ` higher received pronunciation ' and is seen as overly posh or aristocratic . 
  many people do n't like it . 
  however , hrp is actually location-based and suggests nothing whatsoever about class . 
  it 's just that the locations in which it is spoken are usually higher class locations . 
  but you will find working class people who speak hrp and rich people who do not . 
  our ethnicity-based accents have a key difference with those in america - they tend to only appear in first generation immigrants . 
  as in , if you moved here from india , you will have an indian accent , but your children will probably have a regular british accent , based on where you live . 
  there is an african accent , an indian accent , a chinese accent , etc , but there is no black accent or hispanic accent . 
  as i 've already said , location-based accents are the most prominent . 
  and they differ immensely , to the point where someone from devon might find someone from inverness impossible to understand . 
  however , locations carry their own reputations and these are reflected on the speakers of their accents . 
  e.g birmingham is considered to be quite an ugly , grubby city , so the brummie accent is stigmatised as less attractive . 
  but north wales and edinburgh are considered to be really nice , historic and beautiful places , and so their accents are seen as very attractive . 
  [ this map ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/r/53/accent%20map4.png ) is by no means comprehensive , but you can get an idea . 
  in this way , class and location converge . 
  areas with lots of working class people tend to be less appealing , so they have worse reputations , so their accents are more stigmatised . 
  this is why you might consider somewhere like birmingham to be a working class accent , even though it is n't . 
  there is also a kind of vernacular that many ` chavvy ' people have . 
  this is heavily associated with the uneducated , unemployed style of person from the working class , and is seen across the uk , in all areas and ethnicities . 
  it 's kinda like aave i guess , but linked to class rather than race . 
  if you remember the meme a while back about ` cheeky nandos with the lads ' and ` the archbishop of banterbury ' , that was making fun of what many brits consider to be ` chavvy ' language . 
  do n't forget the humble jam roly poly, 
  the idea that the us would have higher standards is news to me . 
  i care about the results of big states like ny , but i do n't need my front page clogged up all day , every day . 
  sure , but i 'm sure you know that 's not what i was inferring . 
  but the netherlands are a germanic country . 
  i wo n't pretend to have put a colossal amount of thought into the comment . 
  and i 'm also not an expert on pretty much anything south east of germany . 
  so you 're probably right . 
  i can imagine a scandinavian union ( sweden , finland , norway , denmark , iceland ) , a baltic union ( estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , possibly belarus ) , a romantic union ( france , italy , spain , belgium , possibly portugal ) and a germanic union ( germany , uk , netherlands , czech rep , austria ) and maybe a mediterranean union ( italy , greece , portugal , spain , malta , france , cyprus , etc ), 
  love the concept . 
  hate the name . 
  you 're right .
