wilfully ignoring `` the rules '' is like having magical powers !, 
  my mates often ask how i make friends so easily and it 's because i actually * talk * to people, 
  with two tap systems , you 're supposed to put the plug in and mix the water in the basin . 
  we do have `` modern '' taps in a lot of places , but you ca n't drink water from bathroom sinks . 
   i use ad blockers too but ca n't believe the entitlement in this thread . 
  this . 
  i pirate and i use ad blockers . 
  i adopt the attitude that i 'm getting away with something that i should n't be able to , rather than that i 'm entitled to it . 
  not saying that either of those are in the same category as stealing , but it all reminds me of a row i got in about shoplifting - i knew a guy who claimed it was a radical act and undermining capitalism and blah blah blah entitlement of the proletariat to the results of the exploitation of labour . 
  i was like , no lol , if you manage to steal a bottle of champagne from tesco 's it 's impressive but it 's still stealing . 
  yeah , you see it with every group of people . 
  royal families , aristocrats , puritans , catholic clergy , communists ... they set out their moral values for the peasants who do n't know any better , and then carry on as before . 
  to quote philomena cunk  it 's kind of exciting to think that in 40 years time , footage of this will be getting played with ominous music in the background and here i am , getting to watch it in real time !, 
  this is what i think . 
  they 've already removed [ the plaque ] ( http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/images/images_streets/inscriptions/central/rhodes_kingedwardst.jpg ) , so i figure it 'd be apt to put up a new plaque talking about how he was a white supremacist who wanted to bring the world under english/anglo-saxon rule , and was responsible for a lot of exploitation in africa , the creation of rhodesia and the subjugation and murder of countless black people . 
  the obvious implication is that if the statue of cecil rhodes must be taken down because he was bad , then statues of bad people need to be taken down ... and that 's most of the old statues in london because surprise surprise the victorians liked colonialists . 
  in fact his defense was that the rhodes scholarship was created through the exploitation of his ancestors , so he 's really taking * his * money . 
  i 'm not entirely sure how your first paragraph relates to my post about how we should make a small adjustment to help out religious people . 
  as it is , easter holiday jump about all over the place , so why not shuffle exams on the off chance they fall during ramadan ? 
  i mean , i do n't think it 's really fair to say `` if you want to do well , just disregard your religion '' . 
  religious observance is important to religious people , plus it 's school kids - they do n't necessarily get that much of a say in the matter because their parents make the rules ( i remember trying to tell my mum i did n't want to go to church on sunday anymore when i was 16 and the drama that wrought ) . 
  well , great lent does n't require you to fast completely . 
  you have to abstain from some things , but you can still eat and drink . 
  meanwhile during ramadan you ca n't eat or drink during daylight hours ( which is when exams are ! ), 
  i got really confused and assumed he was talking about the notting hill carnival . 
  i was like , shit , and i always eat goat patties when i go to that . 
  going without meat for 40 days is not going to do anything . 
  going vegetarian is perfectly fine as long as you eat a balanced diet ( and eating meat does n't necessarily preclude you from taking supplements if you 're not getting a balanced diet anyway ) . 
  you 're probably thinking of vegans , who can be ok without supplements but may struggle to get everything they need ( especially b12 as iirc the only vegan sources of it are kimchi and sauerkraut ), 
  and it 's in eurovision !, 
  ( australia is also apparently in europe ), 
  the french are stereotyped as eating frogs ' legs , to the point where a slang term for french people is frogs . 
  it 's mostly a reference to [ london fog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pea_soup_fog ) . 
  london was historically a very `` foggy '' city because of a thick noxious smog from millions of coal fires being burned at once . 
  my dad remembers being unable to see his outstretched hand during the worst one . 
  so in popular culture london was continually referenced as being foggy , even though clean air acts and [ making london a smoke free zone ] ( https://www.gov.uk/smoke-control-area-rules ) basically eradicated the fogs by the 60s . 
  [ not to mention the ever-increasing price of freddos ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/08/this-is-how-much-a-freddo-will-cost-by-2030/ ) . 
  it 's also probably worth pointing out that while london is known to be a very foggy city , [ it actually has n't been exceptionally foggy since the 60s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pea_soup_fog ) , when coal fires were banned . 
  that 's not to say [ the air in london is any cleaner now , though ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/london-breaches-air-pollution-limit-for-the-whole-of-2016-in-just-over-seven-days-a6811616.html ) . 
   has the euro stolen from your mortgage ? 
   will the poles devalue property prices ? 
   are immigrants ripping off british sovereignty ? 
  are basically the opposite of reality and yet could all be headlines . 
  meanwhile  is cancer giving the middle class cancer ? 
  is far too accurate for a daily mail headline . 
  perhaps they are referring to the fact that boris is the foreign secretary ? 
  the worst of it is when you 're in a pub and some local genius starts explaining how wonderful brexit is . 
  bring up people you know feeling intimidated , scared or even being assaulted and you 're `` fearmongering '' . 
  bring up the drop in the pound ( not the specific massive drop and shoot up , but the trend ) and it 's `` fearmongering '' . 
  bring up your friends losing jobs because brexit has pulled the rug out from british scientists being funded by horizon 2020 and it 's `` fearmongering '' . 
  bring up the potential implications of a hard brexit and it 's `` fearmongering '' . . 
  suggest anything other than a hard brexit and you 're `` anti-democratic '' , because that 's what the people want , yeah ? 
  it does my head in . 
  the nation 's burying its head in the sand and going `` oh , everything will be ok ! '', 
  the level of crime . 
  it 's not just angle grinders , it 's any sort of abrasive disk like disc sanders too . 
  in practice i imagine it 'd be a lot of `` should you wear eye protection ? '', 
  `` should you try and stop the angle driver with your hands  '' `` should you lick the angle grinder while it 's on ? '', 
  the requirement 's pretty much there to stop someone getting randomly handed a grinder and told to go to town without knowing anything about it . 
  most people would get the idea but just like how a food hygiene cert hammers home `` do n't rub raw chicken breasts all over that salad '' it also teaches `` if you 're keeping food warm make sure you keep internal temperatures above this level '' . 
  the usual deciding factors in hate attacks are volume and class . 
  i remember hearing a bloke talking about his grandma 's experience of racism when she first moved to the uk from uganda . 
  the neighbours were generally friendly and she 'd get stopped in the street and complemented on how beautiful and exotic her sari / choli was . 
  by the 70s she 'd deliberately stopped wearing traditional clothing because local yobbos would throw rocks . 
  likewise while the working classes are no more racist than anyone else in britain ( tbh i 've often found working class people are a lot more pragmatic about that sort of thing ) , they 're more likely to be physical about any racism they do have . 
  the upper classes are tremendously racist but they 'd be more likely to bring that up to their political friends than start a fist fight . 
  so if the immigrants are more well off , then they 're probably not going to be living around or socialising in the same places that people who 'd beat them up would be . 
  iirc it 's the hsg 17 abrasive wheels safety cert . 
  you can do a course online in 4 hours and get the certificate ( it 's like # 20 ) . 
  i think it 's mostly for insurance purposes . 
  he 's probably referring to the tensions in the east end a few years back . 
  there was a rise in homophobic hate crimes by a third from 2009 to 2013 , a `` muslim patrol '' , a spate of `` gay free zone - fear allah '' stickers and then there was an accusation that the previous mayor of tower hamlets , lutfur rahman , was deliberately trying to squeeze out non-muslims by selling off all the pubs that tower hamlet owned ( and leased to landlords ) to property developers and deny licenses ( he supposedly had links to the islamic forum of europe which supposedly was a hate group ) . 
  plus the east london mosque had some homophobic speakers . 
  of course that 's all pretty much died down and the east london mosque worked together with rainbow hamlets to help out with east london pride . 
  i do n't think any of that was representative but it 's still fresh in people 's minds . 
   you could n't just be british and none of these it 's not uncommon for people to identify as purely british and nothing else . 
  you 'll hear some english people describe themselves as `` british '' and not really consider themselves english at all , in much the same way that they 'd be more comfortable with a union jack over a st. george 's cross - there 's a negative association with specifically celebrating england vs. celebrating the uk . 
  this is also why scottish and welsh people tend to favour defining via their country rather than `` british '' , because british and english have become kinda linked in that regard . 
  if you want to get technical then the only people in the uk who are n't british are northern irish , who are not on the island of great britain . 
  i imagine the line comes somewhere around hurting people . 
  choosing to wear a burqa does n't hurt anyone . 
  i am aware that many women who wear a burqa do not get to choose , however it is not officially being banned on those grounds . 
  in a scenario where we could make food out of inert particles , the real breakthrough would be that technology rather than 3d printing . 
  i 'm trying to imagine what foods could be made of smaller inert particles . 
  well yeah , the ability to create food from a couple of inert materials would be revolutionary . 
  you 'd still have to load the ingredients into the 3d printer , and those ingredients would still go off . 
  you 'd basically have made a bread machine , except for whatever you put in the machine , like [ this pizza vending machine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4_c1bmt-r8 ) . 
  so it would n't really eliminate food waste , transportation etc. 
  and it 'd probably be a nightmare to clean ... plus it 'd only be able to make foods that were capable of being 3d printed . 
  a robot chef would genuinely be more feasible and useful . 
  [ wikipedia calls it a `` terrorist handbook '' he downloaded from the internet , but either way it 's not hard for a layperson to find out how to make bombs and then purchase all the necessary stuff . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_copeland ) typically the issue would-be bombers face is that they 're not very good at making bombs - which is why the divs who tried to bomb the tube after 7/7 [ were n't very successful ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_july_2005_london_bombings ) - not that they do n't know how to make bombs . 
  the london nailbombings were made from fireworks , nails and an alarm clock via the anarchist cookbook downloaded from the internet . 
  if you 're suicide bombing then you do n't really need a timing element . 
  right , but you ca n't just retire to australia , there 's [ specific visa requirements tied to wealth ] ( http://www.expatinfodesk.com/expat-guide/retiring-abroad/best-places/australia-as-a-retirement-destination/ ) , and there 's no concessions made if you have children who live in australia . 
  spanish hospitals are cheap if you 're [ covered under their terms ] ( http://www.expatica.com/es/healthcare/getting-healthcare-in-spain_101467.html ) , otherwise they 're not cheap at all . 
  pensioners sometimes have to deal with stuff like falling and breaking a hip , or having a stroke - how exactly are they going to manage to fly back to the uk to deal with that ? 
  and spain might not be specifically pushing to expel them . 
  but if they lose the eu right of residence , then they no longer have a right to stay there , so they 'd be expelled as they no longer have a right to stay there . 
   we should of course respect the democratic decision of spain .
