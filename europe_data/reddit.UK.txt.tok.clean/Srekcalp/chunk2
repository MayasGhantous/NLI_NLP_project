   maybe you need to stop imaging me as hitler maybe ? 
  you 're obsessed with hitler , do you have a victim complex ? 
  was n't the first line of my first comment :  obviously today russia is not like nazi germany , also you may note , throughout our discourse i have avoided referring to russia as * you ( russia ) * . 
  and i believe i would 've have debated with you exactly the same whether you had been russian , english or norwegian . 
  well obviously russia is n't treating them well enough , they 're suppressing their right to protest and assembly and intimidating their leaders . 
  your approach to diplomacy is terrible , you ca n't intimidate someone into loving you and you ca n't argue with someone 's feelings . 
  you can only try and change the way they feel about you . 
  maybe your stern unreceptive position , which is likely also the stern unreceptive position of the russian government , is why the tatars feel scared of you --  hating you . 
  from the way you 're talking , i would not like to be a tatar in a territory annexed by you , you do n't sound like a very flexible or tolerant leader at all . 
  i do n't think the tatars care about the actual deportations , you 're right - they happened seventy years ago . 
  i think they are more worried because this is an event they commemorated annually and this russian repression of it is representative of how the russian government intends to treat them while they live under russian rule . 
  stalin deported the tatars as a form of collective punishment , as a warning to everyone else . 
  he knowingly killed people loyal to him and those who were completely innocent . 
   i do n't see why tatars have to hate russia . 
  do they really though , maybe they 're just trying acknowledge their history . 
  you 're right israel does n't hate germany , but it would if germany tried to stop it from commemorating the holocaust . 
   modern-day russia treats the tatars in its own borders better than ukraine treated theirs . 
  wow , you need to lay off the kool-aid bro . 
  here 's a crazy thought : * ` maybe modern-day russia still does n't treat them well enough ' * . 
  your defence is basically , well they treat you slightly better than this other group of assholes so you should allow them to push you around and suppress you . 
  obviously today russia is not like nazi germany , but stalin and hitler were indentical . 
  the only thing stalin did n't have , was hitler 's gas chambers . 
  stalin also played with ethnic purity by deporting the kimleks , the kulaks to siberia thus condemning them to death . 
  he probably would 've killed more , had he had the fuel and ammunition to spare . 
  heck he even '' [ punish-deported ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_crimean_tatars ) '' the entire crimean tatar race , killing nearly half of them off . 
  this is why people are still angry today . 
  but we do n't care about it in the west , because we do n't have kulaks here . 
  nor does deportation provide the shocking imagery the holocaust does . 
  that 's if there was any left anyway , russia won ww2 so they were able to erase their worse crimes and stifle them to this day . 
  bro , i love polandball , one only has to mutter `` treaty of tri ... '' and it 's a shit storm . 
  my favourite part of watching romanians and hungarians argue is they take that mutha back in time , like all the way back to genghis khan and the mongal invasion , stuff that was like 1000 years ago !? 
  i 'm pretty sure you/they could argue about who stole which part of the primordial soup from the other , 
  when does the argument with the romanians over transylvania start , did i miss it ? 
  that blob of blue on top of that yellow map - rage inducing non ? 
  let 's break out the beak tanks and crush the flat footed scum, 
  seems like a chill guy, 
   uk independence now ha , nice try `` an independence from europe '' party , the `` soni '' of political parties . 
  yeah i think you 're right mate , if you ca n't make a tactical vote , you can at least vote for the guys opposing them, 
  although i believe the entire uk is shifting to the right , more concerning is ukips unification of the uk 's traditionally diffused racists and nationalists under a legitimate banner of acceptable `` anti-immagrant '' . 
  when i used this [ site ] ( https://www.myvote2014.eu/en/your-vote/cast-vote ) , my current views did actually coincide most with lib dems . 
  that said , although i care about how my country is represented in the european union , i care more about opposing ukip on any level . 
  so for those of us , who only care about stopping ukip , how should we vote tactically ? 
  would voting for ukip 's [ biggest opponent ] ( http://goo.gl/i6a7bi ) , labour , be the best strategy ? 
  i know it 's not a [ first-past-the-post ] ( http://www.europarl.org.uk/en/european_elections/the_voting_system.html ) system , so is there anyway we can vote tactically at all ? 
  and maybe donetsk too, 
  wow , thank you , i never knew this . 
  i 've never used '' \u00c9ire '' , but if i was asked i would 've thought an irishman would 've been offended , if offended at all , by my use of `` ireland '' as it is the english name . 
  out of curiosity how would an englishman pronounce '' \u00c9ire '' ? 
  except the advert is only in ukrainian, 
  you mean the left ? 
  but you do n't want stereotypes !? 
  well i 've only met one bulgarian ( two if you count her daughter ) and she 's probably one of the best nursing assistants i 've ever seen . 
  my wife is romanian , and i study the region often . 
  but i do n't know much about bulgarians , i just consider it as a another generic slav country . 
  that said , my fellow countrymen ( uk ) probably could n't even tell you where it is . 
  they 'd probably only hear of bulgaria when the bulgarian/romanian immigrant worker issue comes up .

  typical old europe question, 
  i like comparing [ 11 and 12 ] ( http://imgur.com/one2uwq ), 
  that is an astute observation my main man . 
  good link too, 
  ha no , but i realise now it 's going to be impossible to convince you that i 'm not an alcoholic on probation also , hats off for using `` alcohol enthusiast '' , sounds much more positive than `` alcoholic '' . 
  it 's '' [ per mille ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/permille ) '' , it means 1/10 of the value . 
  fuck knows why my phone only has this icon , i probably downloaded some odd language pack that changed it . 
  my god damn phone only has the '' \u2030 '' icon . 
  anyway i meant without suggestions for actual physical changes , your post is just effectively a plea for europeans to be nicer to each other . 
  that 's europe , the continent that 's been famously killing each other since the dawn of time . 
  i 've just about had enough of you kuerbelopians strutting your stuff around here . 
  logic of post : 100 \u2030 effectiveness of post : 0 \u2030, 
  russia idea of rich is how many statues of lenin you have, 
  yeah true , i wonder if they 'll just seek an even greater presence in transnistria . 
  i do n't understand why the russians do n't do as the americans , for example : korea , the americans wanted a military base there , so they basically made south korea rich . 
  if the russians made transnistria rich , i 'm sure more moldovans would want to `` switch sides '' . 
  what do you think ? 
  moldova is so poor at the moment though , would it benefit the russians ? 
  probably kazakhstan , because who gives a shit about kazakhstan ? 
  i 'd much rather have the trifle than rape someone , i guess we 'll never have anything in common with soviet conscripts of wwii, 
   against stalin 's will , stalin condoned raping , even though he officially forbid it  does djilas , who is himself a writer , not know what human suffering and the human heart are ? 
  ca n't he understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometers through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle ? 
  stalin, 
   i love france so much that i would have every town and village of it be mine henry v, 
   the us has no interest in ( russia ) since we have ** very little economic or geographic relations ** ( with them ) . 
   [ the us does n't give a damn about russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkjxfjfcrca ), 
  bro , you do not understand . 
  you 're the only one talking about ukraine here . 
  the thread asks how we feel about having a us military presence in our country . 
  i 've never liked it , in fact [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/1tok3o/thoughts_on_us_military_bases_in_yourother/cea3n8a ) a post i made about it before the ukraine crisis even started . 
  my answer is n't topical , and the current events in ukraine have nothing to do with my answer to this thread . 
  who said anything about ukraine ? 
   russia invading ukraine is first and foremost a problem for europe ... ** at the moment . 
  ** russia and america have been measuring cocks and escalating tensions with each other for the last 70 years , and they 'll probably keep doing it for the next 70 years . 
  i 'm worried that we 're just a staging post for an american war with russia . 
  so while the russians and americans are sitting back , sipping mojitos and measuring their cocks , we 'll be getting bombed to shit . 
  me too mate :(, 
  sorry , i hold nothing in higher regard than a human life . 
  so i would say if facing death and with no alternative , better to run home than die on a pavement . 
  it 's not a popular opinion and it 's not romantic , but killing people over political ideals is fucking dumb ( i mean that for both sides ) and is fair description of every european war . 
  if there is a war , how many will die , how long will it last , what will it achieve ? 
  ten years from now , when the war is over and everything is back to normal , will it have been worth it ? 
  i agree the protesters need protecting from the police , but would the army attempt the clear the protesters ?
