  uk revokes malta 's george cross , gives to san marino, 
  and remember , the bastards did n't throw any points our way either, 
  lol , what most europeans do n't understand about being a true british eurovision fan is that we 're all genuinely stoked we did n't come last or get zero points . 
  i think we should get rid of that jury voting and make it 100 % televoting, 
  do n't the swiss have some fucked democracy system that stopped women being able to vote until the 70 's ? 
  something to do with lots of red tape ? 
  and chaplin moustache, 
  bravo , yuu are good romanian comrade, 
  erghh , we do n't even want a united states of america, 
  ` om nom nom , see , nom , bloody foreigners , best of british , om nom , learn english ', 
  is the dinosaurs face that of a politicians too ? 
  holy shit , i think i recognise your user name , are you a mod on wikipedia milhist ? 
  lol never heard of slim , why 's he your boi ? 
  romanticized yes , but it is still factual that medieval knights were ransomed . 
  and that would not try to escape until their ransom was paid . 
  many were allowed to leave such as the above example , and returned . 
  if the did n't , they risked forfeiting their honour , honour in medieval times had real , literal value . 
  this feels like a great time to bring up american idiots such as general pershing . 
  who sacrificed 3,500 of his men attacking german territory , despite it being armistice day and despite knowing the germans would surrender hours later and that his men could 've just marched over and taken the same territory without a shot being fired . 
  this is how america treats it 's soldiers . 
  reminds me very much of medieval times, 
  that 's some language you got there netherlands, 
  imi pare bine ... but as i said there is no european policy to take everyone in , and the links you provide do not state this . 
  the line has already been drawn , this is simply a discussion of whether we should move it further forward . 
  perhaps we should , but if we do , we should better fund the measures we already have in place . 
  i ca n't think of any border agency that has n't complained of under-funding , under-staffing , delays in red tape etc. 
  we do n't need to invent new solutions to this problem , such as concentration camps and anti-immigrant campaigns . 
  does being romanian mean this is not your problem then ? 
  it 's a european issue . 
  some might consider romania as one of the gateways to the eu . 
  other anti-migrants in this thread may hold their grudges particularly because of a class of immigrant that comes from within romania . 
  i do n't think we should be doing anything to make our country less desirable . 
  i 'm reminded of the [ plan ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9830428/dont-come-here-its-not-very-nice-ministers-plan-campaign-to-put-off-romanians-and-bulgarians-migrants.html ) for the uk to produce an anti-uk ad campaign . 
  what makes this especially odd , is that just one year prior we had a massive pro-uk campaign for the 2012 olympics , encouraging people to come to the uk . 
  this logic is counter-intuitive , like when drunk jeff goldblum suggests trashing the earth , so the aliens wo n't want it . 
  i 'll grant the current system is n't great . 
  but it is far better than the dangerous precedents set by establishing concentration camps or an atmosphere of hostility towards immigrants . 
  you seem to be trying to communicate with me earnestly , so i 've tried to do the same with you . 
  but when you say ` european policy of taking everyone in ' it 's seems emotive and unfactual . 
  can you link me to the ` policy ' that 's says european will ` take everyone in ' ? 
  just means i 'm saying something worth while , you should try it . 
  oh well if we 're just playing make-believe then ... ' i too propose the eu should build a perfect concentration camp , that is so nice , people actually refuse to leave . 
  i also think we should build a european colony on mars . 
  and that we should ban all nuclear weapons . 
  and work even harder on a cure for cancer . ', 
  does a camp such as this exist anywhere than in your imagination ? 
  please provide a source . 
  that just means your easily offended . 
  easily offended people are the worst . 
  so as long as there is n't nazis and gas chambers , concentration camps are ok places ? 
  you sound entitled and uneducated . 
  nope , even regular non-nazi concentration camps are terrible places . 
  lawless with inadequate healthcare facilities , unsanitary , poor amenities for children , corrupt and a deprivation of civil liberties . 
  but you 'd know all this , if you read the rest of the article you linked to . 
  ca n't believe i have to actually explain that concentration camps are a bad thing ( for anyone except the jailers that is ) . 
   a shitty place like a concentration camp ? 
  you know you 've gone too far when a german is telling you : ` steady on , that 's a bit extreme is n't it ' :p you ever heard of ` jewish quotas ' ? 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_quota shockingly interesting to see how prevalent it was, 
  op is essentially saying : ` you know how you can stop illegal immigrants ; concentration camps ', 
  so where did they put them then ? 
  the gypsies will never be able to integrate into romanian culture , because romanians will never accept them . 
  romanian citizenship is acquired at birth . 
  [ romanian nationality law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_nationality_law ), 
  yeah it 's hard to sympathise with one race , while they 're acting like nazis to another . 
  and if a gypsy has romanian citizenship and a romanian passport what are they then my little iron guard ? 
  the national mood is impressively pessimistic, 
  can you link to the post that caused you to tag him as that ? 
  wow , doing this is a headfuck . 
  reading a comment is like : * i strongly agree with this * oh , hmm , no i really do n't agree with that * oh my god , yes !, 
  are you reading my mind ? 
  i agree with you so much i think we 're soul mates . 
  * oh god no !, 
  what the fuck no !, 
  that 's horrible and you 're horrible . 
  erm mtv ? 
  it 's called a coast guard , they guard your coast . 
  also helps if it 's not staffed entirely by drunk corrupt buffoons . 
  rules of engagement , if they engage you , run away . 
  yeah french is surrendering . 
  italians is incompetence . 
  yeah i ca n't stand multi-lingual people . 
  i could learn a second language too , but it feels much easier to find ways to nullify their accomplishments instead . 
  you 're alright sausage x, 
  do n't forgot that we also essentially laid the ground work for ww2 . 
  the reddit user srekcalp is british and therefore finds the royal family [ incapable of error ] ( http://chrisspivey.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/hitler1.jpg ) .

  but only after the gutsy captain threatened to ram the fucking country ), 
  the reddit user srekcalp does not condone the actions of any 13th century english king . 
  my bad . 
  just trying to keep spreading the word on the holocaust in romania . 
  a surprisingly large number of romanians do n't know about it . 
  edit : or refuse to acknowledge it, 
  [ for the next time a romanian makes you feel bad about the holocaust ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32882g/an_image_gallery_of_the_flamboyant_romanian_mayor/cq95j5r ), 
  just for your future reference mate , romania totally did ` have a holocaust ' . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/04/romania.asp ) the yad vashem profile on romania . 
  romania had concentration camps and pogroms and killed between 380,000 -- 400,000 jews during the holocaust . 
  uk here , everyone else learn my language and customs so it 's easier for me to order your food . 
  what do you mean you all hate me ? 
  it 's just common sense , do n't unprovokedly invade sovereign nations , bomb the shit out of them and expect the populace to love you,
