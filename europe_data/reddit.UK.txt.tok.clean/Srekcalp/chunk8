  the gap is a 52 year period that ( like you said ) includes ww2 and the cold war . 
  not to mention europe underwent dramatic changes in the 20th century . 
  this chart would be better if it displayed gnp every decade , until present day . 
  passport covers : seriously , what 's the fucking point ? 
  you have to take them out of the holder when you use them at the airport . 
  that 's the only time you have use your passport . 
  getting in on the ground floor, 
  what 's ` wales ' ? 
  gura tigani !, 
  the only person british intelligence have successfully assassinated was princess diana, 
  i 'm sure when the time comes , we 'll follow you into the hornet 's nest, 
  no , romanians are on the emergency exits as soon as the wheels start to touch the run way . 
  they already texted their ride on the descent , so that they can driving alongside the plane as it lands, 
  of course it does, 
  tell me again how the combined forces of europe are meant to be a credible deterrent to russian invasion ? 
  googles `` angels\u00e4chsisch '' , first result german wikipedia . 
  clicks link , instantly sees article for '' [ anglosph\u00e4re ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/angels%c3%a4chsisch ) '' . 
  this is the type of user we 're talking about right ? 
  when retards refer to people with origins or ancestors in the british isles as anglo-saxons . 
  the anglo-saxons were a race of people who lived in just england and were conquered nearly a thousand years ago . 
  on the subject of ` good luck ' , how popular is the word * bafta * ? 
  i heard it used in a dub of toy story 3 , but whenever i use it i seem to get blank looks like i have n't been understood . 
  when you tell a friend ` good luck ' before an interview or something , how do you say it ? 
  i came to this conclusion after looking more into nuclear conflict , there 's a lot about people do n't understand . 
  obviously london would be the primary target in the event of an attack . 
  i 'd thoroughly recommend watching the 1984 film ' [ threads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/threads ) ' for an understanding of how delicate society actually is and how easily overrun our emergency services can be . 
  or as fellow londoner , take a road trip the excellent [ kelvedon hatch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kelvedon_hatch_secret_nuclear_bunker ) and you 'll see that even the government did n't plan to stay in the london in the event of an emergency . 
  re ; food . 
  although there are large stockpiles of food in london there is a large supply of hungry people . 
  no food is actually produced in london , it is brought in - one of the ` governors ' of iraq shortly after the americans occupied it , lt. col. david couvillon , stated : `` a city is only nine meals away from anarchy '' . 
  i should 've expanded , so the reality of these threats only became apparent to me in adulthood . 
  as a londoner it 's obvious moving away from the city is one of the first most beneficial solutions . 
  i can quit my job and move sure , but am i going to leave my family and loved ones behind ? 
  there 's no right answer to that , now i have a wife who also has family and loved ones and we have a house . 
  so the longer you leave it , the harder it gets . 
  i often daydream about this but the fact is being a proper ` prepper ' is a full-time lifestyle choice that requires money and living in the correct location . 
  most of us do n't have the correct resources in place to convert to this lifestyle , if we did it would likely hamper our efforts to survive in our current non-dystopian world . 
  i used to be concerned about super coronal mass ejections ( cme ) such as 1859 's [ carrington event ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_storm_of_1859 ) which are cyclical and would have the effect of a global emp . 
  the us actually assembled an 'em p commission ' to investigate and advise on the effects of an emp . 
  their [ reports ] ( http://www.empcommission.org/reports.php ) draw on comparable historic incidents and give glum insight into how quickly society would crumble . 
  an interesting read . 
  care to expand upon that ? 
   this is still nowhere on the level of the us though . 
  [ ... yet ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150704131012/https:/twitter.com/poppylegion/status/396308596461273088 ), 
  although it 's already being used as a political tool to denounce anyone who does n't observe it , which was always its intended goal . 
  not romanian but think vlad the impaler might fit the criteria . 
  to the rest of the world he 's just the gruesome inspiration for dracula , brutally impaling women and children . 
  in romania , vlad \u021aepe\u0219 is a national hero who resisted the ottoman empire and only impaled his enemies and corrupt politicians . 
  yes but you put the plug in first , so i 'd wager it 's actually slightly less wasteful than a tap that runs straight into the drain while your lathering your hands . 
  * come and have a go if you think you 're hard enough !, 
  `` pe aici nu se trece '' ( you shall not pass ) allegedly from the battle of m\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti . 
  / r/rachelriley, 
  ` cromwell ' is a good film that covers the civil war . 
  bonus : ` the white queen ' tv series covers the war of the roses . 
  hey , watch your french buddy !, 
  so , one of those questions that 's not actually a question ? 
  thanks ... 
  i 'm english and feel exactly the same way , but if we ever get a say in changing it : i 'm voting for '' [ beside the seaside ] ( https://youtu.be/l-0bprqqqf8 ) '', 
  you just reminded me of brexit related sub some guy created to cash in on the karma post referendum . 
  after a couple of months he got sick of it and tried to ban sarcasm , banning brits from sarcasm . 
  / u/skuld / u/britishenglishpolice why do you just lock the sub and redirect it to / r/unitedkingdom ? 
  the top post currently is literally just a woman 's fanny . 
  the country that gave the world the magna carta , / r/england is a fucking spam filled graveyard, 
  typical klingons , they 'll never accept you . 
  yes , incredibly so , you check out / r/shitamericanssay , it 's one of the classic clich\u00e9s there . 
  in fact , it comes up so often that it probably does n't even get upvoted anymore , but check out the sidebar for classics . 
  fucking hell , the moment i clicked that link i got that annoying jingle from their [ latest advert ] ( https://youtu.be/inw_gcncogcin ) in my head . 
  fucking / r/hailcorporate , fuck coke , fuck their brainwashing , coca-cola invented fanta just so they could sell it to the nazis during ww2, 
  the falkland islands article is titled ' * islas malvinas * ' on the spanish language wikipedia . 
  https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/islas_malvinas this is the politically charged name the argentines use to refer to the islands due to their claim over them and not a literal spanish translation . 
  an austrian lecturing us on how a nation 's leader can have an * impact * on other european countries ... trust me dude , we know !, 
  hold on , let me just check my history book for `` controversial political figures of germany ... '', 
  what 's the weather like in chad ? 
  why are you asking this question ? 
  of course not !, 
  you 're the one true descendents of the roman empire , ca n't speak for the rest of the rabble though . 
  i 'm gon na take a shot in the dark here : have you ever been to europe ? 
  but you have `` eastern european ancestry '' !, 
  no worries , after brexit my country 's planning on how it can knock america back off the top pedestal for * `` stupidest thing a populace willingly does to itself . 
   uh , besides being the first country to write protection for same-sex marriages into the constitution by popular vote you mean ? 
  ah yes , you 're right , i was getting gay rights confused with abortions . 
  ireland : fine to be gay , just not a woman who wants to be in control of her body . 
  sorry , my bad . 
   schools in ireland and the u.k. wo n't give me eu tuition rates how come ? 
  obviously the uk is about to implode re : the eu , and ~ ~ ireland does n't have a great track record with homosexuality ~ ~ . 
  but not having to learn another language would be huge help . 
  edit : ireland was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage on a national level by popular vote, 
  still the king of the pop , but also probably a paedophile , definitely a weirdo . 
  managed to make music so good that it brainwashed an entire planet into overlooking an inconvenient truth . 
  your girlfriend left you for an irish guy . 
  it 's because scotland does n't exist , it was destroyed by an explosion at that same whiskey distillery in 1872 and what we think is `` scotland '' is actually a collectively shared aftershock resonating in our minds . 
  uk , england . 
  american accents , unfortunately not . 
  irish accents seem to get everyone frothing at the gusset ( myself included ) .
