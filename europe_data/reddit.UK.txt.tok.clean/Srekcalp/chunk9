  when you drive into my town you 'll see people dressed as nazis and ww2 tommy 's outside our local pub ... which is nice . 
  since armed forces day was invented in 2009 we have a lot more military hardware parades , you can see hundreds of videos on youtube . 
  it 's a bit like remembrance day , but without the inconvenience of solemnity . 
  just to clarify , i believe ` child molester ' is the term for paedophiles who 've committed a crime . 
  technically a paedophile can seek treatment before they commit a crime and never offend . 
  bet he 's glad to have the balaclava now, 
  oh ok , i think i know why . 
  i was here the day this sub was setup , i think i did it then . 
  i presume if you set a custom flair when it 's available it keeps it locked in . 
  i believe paging users like this only works with a maximum of three username . 
  edit : also , arent flairs customizable on this sub ? 
  mine appears to be, 
  for the same reason as [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/pdfgd_qyhdo?t=1m38s ) . 
  i know , they 're awesome right, 
  they 've got nothing on the ' [ angel summoner and bmx bandit ] ( https://youtu.be/zfumpytyrjw ) ', 
  there is a ' [ captain britain ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/7/78/brian_braddock_\\ ( earth-616 \\ ) _ revolutionary_war . jpg/revision/latest ? cb = 20131206070421 ) ' and in true british fashion he 's a cheap emulation of the american original . 
  edit : although there was a comic called ' [ superman : true brit ] ( https://aw1x.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/superman_true_brit.jpg ) ' , i ca n't remember many of the gags other than what is on wikipedia . 
  he accidentally impales a guy with a cricket bat who survives and becomes ` bat-man ' , with the bat still sticking out of his chest . 
  yes , yes , come to england and view the majesty of ... the midlands, 
  bait thread, 
  thread about religion only has 6 upvotes , but has 60 comments ... this can only end well, 
  the eu referendum and the sharp rise in racist hate crimes . 
  if you 're expecting an earnest answer that 'd be impossible , because it 'd be as stupid as me trying to hold you to account for every anecdotal infringement caused by italian tourists . 
  fortunately you obviously were n't expecting an earnest answer and this is just nationalist rant reddit drama you 're trying to provoke . 
  me neither , if there is one , i suspect it 's a one-way unreciprocated one, 
  yeah , you 'd think they 'd be more interested in giving statehood to organised unincorporated territories such as puerto rico , so that the millions of american citizens who live there can finally get some of that democratic representation that america has been spreading around the world . 
  that 's the problem ... 
   some people call the british inselaffen ( island monkeys ) , i 'm not sure why , though . 
  there is no real rivalry going on beyond calling them names , as far as i 'm aware of . 
  from reddit i was surprised to learn that while germany is our main football rival , that germany does n't even consider us rivals , and has a rivalry with holland instead . 
  which ties in brilliantly with a ) the pompous british opinion of itself on the world stage b ) just how shit the english football team really is . 
   unisex facilities are common in many public spaces like train stations really ? 
  i have never personally witnessed anything like this , anywhere , ever . 
  op , regarding the image you posted - i get that same reaction from romanians . 
  they say `` why ? 
  you should learn italian/spanish or french instead '' . 
  i 've always suspected it 's because * their * language . 
  and as anglo-romanian relations are pretty acrimonious at the moment , they do n't want * us * learning * their * language . 
  that said , the romanians on / r/romania and especially / r/romanian have been bloody helpful , in fact probably all the romanians i 've met online have had the same response as the russians/koreans/spanish in your example . 
  it only seems to be the ones i 've met in real life that do n't like it , irregardless of if you 're meeting them in romania or the uk . 
  they 'll find something else to fear monger about . 
  no political party has ever said : * our objectives have been met now , we resign * . 
  [ unsuccessful troll is unsuccessful ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/413ss2/bill_aiming_to_ban_child_marriages_shot_down_in/cyzm3cg ) , go home people . 
  or if you still want to have a laugh , take a look at the [ last guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/3qmivp/will_i_be_safe_in_europe/cwkge2x ) who tried it ( and much better imo ) . 
  that was fucking hilarious . 
  awesome , thanks for replying . 
  does grizzlyblake91 have any travel plans for the future ? 
  are you still in the military ? 
  if there was one piece of advice you could give the users of / r/askeurope , that you 've learned from your time in the military , what would it be ? 
  [ update ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/3qmivp/will_i_be_safe_in_europe/cwkge2x ), 
  [ found it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/24m17e/weaponspersonal_defense_while_backpacking_xpost/ ) , sort of . 
  op deleted the original / r/askeurope post , but fortunately reposted it in / r/backpacking . 
  i ca n't find the original , but he alludes to it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/24m17e/weaponspersonal_defense_while_backpacking_xpost/ch8quc6 ) . 
  the askeurope post was largely derided with comments like `` please do n't come '' and people talking the piss out of his `` active duty navy military police '' and `` i 'm trained to be aware of my surroundings '' comments . 
  this backpacking thread kind of adds to the comedy though , as you can once the demographic returns to an american majority the comments are generally `` i do n't see what the problem is , seems a sensible question '' lol . 
  edit : [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/24m46l/american_wants_to_know_what_weapons_he_can_bring/ ) the / r/shitamericanssay post about it and the [ original ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/24m1ji/weaponsself_defense_while_solo_backpacking_across/ ), 
  i tried to find it on mobile last night , but could n't . 
  i will find it for you brother !, 
  you 're lelcome, 
  someone [ here ] ( http://reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/3qmr0x/a_white_american_christian_wants_to_know_if_its/cwgnptg ) worked out she 'd even be safe if she went in a time machine and visited nazi germany , as even by nazi standards she 'd only be a quarter jewish thus still be eligible for german citizenship . 
  the only antisemitic person i can detect is op . 
  going on about fucking `` jewish facial features '' and talking about being 1/4 jewish . 
  like who the fuck would know or care ? 
  does anyone remember that thread started by that american guy who was going to backpack through europe and wanted to know what weapons he could bring ? 
  this reminds me a lot of that , i kind of wish op would stay in america . 
  do n't worry op , when you visit , at the very least , you 'll be treated better than the way blacks , mexicans and native americans are treated in america . 
  edit : nice try op , but i screenshotted that shit : http://i.imgur.com/4o37wx8.png edit 2 : armed american backpacker post .

  ha ha !, 
  i do n't know much , did n't prominent greek-americans pressure the u.s to get involved and thus influence the united nations ? 
  does n't seem very fair . 
  who gives a fuck what they call their country , north korea is the ** democratic ** people 's republic of korea , a lie , but we still call them it . 
  this is so true . 
  i live next door to a rental , the former english tenants spent the day smashing up the shed by throwing rocks at it . 
  the next tenants were romanian , he fixed it up it himself ( although in classic romanian style , kitchen lino on the roof ) out of his own pocket . 
  i remember telling him the landlord is supposed to make/pay for the repairs , but he told me that the landlord had refused . 
  the tenant fixed it anyway - very eastern european logic , if something is broken you fix it, 
  is there a milan subreddit ? 
  try there edit : / r/milan is private . 
  i 'd recommend trying / r/italy , as / r/askitaly is dead . 
  also are n't there travelling subs , for stuff like backpacking , they might have some answers, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/international/greece-to-set-up-some-sort-of-tax-system-2015022495671 ), 
  all the while he 's getting choke-fucked by china, 
  these morons want the commonwealth back , and believe that we have genuine ` special relationship ' with america who will oook after us and somehow this will all work out economically , despite the fact we 're fucking miles away from any other anglo countries . 
  british weather is a state of mind, 
  had an ex like that , used to call her screnglish . 
  on her first trip to scotland , upon leaving edinburgh airport , a dismal march morning , she said some shit like ' i feel like i 'm home ' lol, 
  sorry man, 
  i read a guide book before i went to amsterdam saying the same thing . 
  basically , although smoking weed is legal , the dutch do n't exactly relish a bunch of fucked up brits monging up the place . 
  so after i smoked in cafe i got super paranoid ( of course ) , worrying that every dutch person i encountered would know i was high ( they probably did ) and would be offended . 
  netherlands right ? 
  in europe we do n't give a shit how you style your hair . 
  welcome . 
  spain might have opposed/obstained . 
  they have catalonia which wants to secede , if spain support scotland it would be de-facto support for catalonia, 
  thanks, 
  brit here , holland would be a preference or any of the scandinavian countries . 
  edit : fix, 
  much smaller morsels for mother russia to digest,
