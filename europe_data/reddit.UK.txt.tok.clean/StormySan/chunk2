  indeed . 
  the version i know had them yell `` ale ! '', 
  and `` whiskey ! '', 
  respectively . 
  then the irishman tripped as he was getting onto the slide and yelled `` shit ! '', 
  shut it yoo schlaaaaaaag, 
  i was thinking more of the germans that i 've met than any national stereotypes , 
  as i was writing that comment i was thinking `` like germany ... '' seriously , you guys are * fun * drunks . 
  nice idea . 
  i 'll give it a few days to get enough data posted here and see if i can knock something together . 
  ** edit : ** have discovered [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aoonojl.jpg ) , though am unsure of its provenance . 
  one of the best in the thread here, 
  nice , had n't seen these before !, 
  grew up in essex . 
  can confirm this is true . 
  we have many jokes with the irish being portrayed as a bit stupid . 
  curiously , i 've learned most of them via irish friends . 
  an irishman walks into a pub , goes up to the bar and says to the barman , `` i 'll have 5 shots of whiskey please patrick '' . 
  the barman replies , `` well surely seamus , it sounds like you be celebrating something ? '', 
  `` to be sure , i 'm celebrating my first blowjob '' . 
  `` that 's brilliant seamus !, 
  have another one on me ! '', 
  `` thank you but no , patrick . 
  i 'm thinking , if 5 shots does n't get rid of the taste then 6 wo n't either . '', 
  ^ ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ good ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ names , ^ ^ ^ me . 
  we have the exact same jokes , but with the irish as the targets . 
  eg : what do you do if an irishman throws a grenade at you ? 
  take out the pin and throw it back . 
  what do you do if an irishman throws a pin at you ? 
  run for it , he 's got a grenade !, 
  [ scandinavia and the world ] ( http://satwcomic.com/ ) has some amazing comics on national stereotypes . 
  [ a personal favourite ] ( http://satwcomic.com/art/what-a-nice-everything.jpg ) . 
  because yes , we put * so * much tat in our gardens . 
  christ , it 's always us that have the batshit crazy drunks : / why ca n't we produce more amiable , fun & friendly drunks ? 
  so what exactly is `` freeriding '' referring to ? 
  edit : the silence is deafening . 
  all countries receive funds back in various ways . 
  wiki 's [ article on the eu 's funding ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_statistics#eu_budget ) takes into account things like the uk 's rebates . 
  even with these factored in , the uk is still one of the biggest net contributors to the eu budget . 
  second only to germany , in fact . 
  and equally vilified . 
  oh indeed !, 
  you guys are more about the netherlands , right ? 
  you 've humiliated us more than enough times for you to rightfully not give a damn about us  though i was very pleased when you last hosted the world cup to see most of our supporters switch to supporting you guys when we went out . 
  good to see that aforementioned idiocy is dying out . 
  exactly . 
  calling the match `` emotionally charged '' is an understatement . 
  also went a long way into why argentina were so unrepentant about it , and treated maradona like a hero . 
  england has particular rivalries with germany & argentina when it comes to football . 
  some of the beef with germany is a bit of an idiotic hangover of wwii . 
  but from 1970 to 2000 , england lost [ every single competitive match ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/england%e2%80%93germany_football_rivalry#comparison_of_england_and_germany_in_major_international_tournaments ) they had against germany , and since then they 've won most of them . 
  they wiped the floor with us . 
  argentina , well , we 've never forgiven them for the [ `` hand of god '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argentina_v_england_\\ ( 1986_fifa_world_cup_quarter-final \\ ) # .22 hand_of_god .22 _ goal ) incident , though there were earlier incidents . 
  and then brutally fucked them up the arse . 
  i do n't believe anyone was suggesting otherwise . 
  we now have far fewer balaclavas and far fewer bombs . 
  see , it worked . 
  i 'll concede that - we definitely do still have issues , but it 's certainly a vast improvement over what it used to be . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/rangers-fans-jailed-after-manchester-898127 ) , [ we ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22140395 ) [ never ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-22143572 ) [ have ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/apr/02/newsstory.sport7 ) [ riots ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5219906.stm ) [ now ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8221451.stm ),

   since you 're a brit and probably like farage thank you for that wonderful tarring with your all-purpose brush . 
  for the record , i consider most of his policies and attitudes to be quite odious , but as you seem to have fairly set preconceived notions of what we 're all like than there seems to be little more point to trying to have a sane discussion . 
  it 's just a comparison - one could equally say we 're not france or germany when using examples of why to integrate more . 
  the point is that arguing that a country will be poorer for not being a part of the eu falls down as other countries do so successfully . 
  it 's working well for switzerland so far . 
  and norway . 
  dutch feels like halfway between german and english to me . 
  plus that sing-song accent is just great fun , 
  if it 's a fair vote by genuine representatives of the region 's populace , then no , i see no issue with it at all . 
  still rather concerned at how russia had troops seize the region before it occurred , of course . 
  half the time i think it 's purely down to our politician 's egos !, 
  but we do have one of the highest gdp and population of all the countries in the eu behind only germany and france , and the biggest military budget in the eu . 
  france is the only other country in the eu with nuclear weaponry . 
   notice one recurring trend oh indeed : / our politicians just love using these as points to spin on . 
  irrational pride sparked . 
  good on you , sirs and ladies of science . 
  christ yes , i remember this . 
  when i was a young lad i played in a youth football team that had an exchange scheme with a german side - every other year our u/13 side would go visit them for a week , and vice versa the following year . 
  parents and immediate family also often went along , of course , and were hosted by a family of the other team . 
  i stayed with one of my teammates whilst my mother and baby sister stayed with another family . 
  the lady my mother stayed with was lovely , but did n't speak particularly wonderful english . 
  still better than my mother 's german , but i digress . 
  one morning , my mother walked out into the kitchen , with my sister in her arms , to be greeted by this lady preparing breakfast whilst singing along to [ chubby brown - alice ( nsfw !, 
  ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhbrq3j-lei ) that was playing on the * radio * . 
  midway through singing she notices my mother , with my sister , misinterprets her shocked expression and cheerily asks , `` oh , you know this song ? '', 
  ** tl ; dr they do n't censor english swear words on the radio in other countries **, 
  100 % of the uk live on an island . 
  it 's just that 3 % live on the corner of an island that is mostly another country . 
  that actually makes it even sweeter . 
  technically it 's an [ exempt charity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_mary,_university_of_london#organisation_and_administration ) , apparently . 
  possibly why they 're trying to get away with this bollocks . 
  alas , this is nothing to do with the government so those laws would n't be involved anyway, 
  utterly , utterly shameful that they 're allowing this to take place . 
  the university is under no compulsion to allow it whatsoever , yet they 're just going along with it . 
  thank you for the clarification and expansion . 
  look , i 'm not about to start laying out the workings of your own government for you . 
  if the thought is bothering you that much , go and educate yourself .
