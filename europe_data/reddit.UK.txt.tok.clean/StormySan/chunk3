  except that the parliament had already passed into law that they must be bound by eu laws . 
  and all of these suggestions would fit so nicely on the image as well !, 
  that i do like, 
  you do n't tend to get invited over specifically for a cuppa these days , they 're more incidental to someone being over for whatever other reason . 
  a cup of tea comes into its own when you have something you 're working on or mulling over - it helps the work to go smoother . 
  you could probably add in a bicycle for the netherlands . 
  i certainly do n't see obamacare as a good solution , but it 's still a hell of a lot better than what it is patching up . 
  a single step in the right direction is still better than standing still . 
   if you are able to get a work/residence visa to the us , you likely have a job where healthcare is n't going to be a problem to me , it is n't about a purely personal perspective . 
  i would n't want to live in a country where those who hit rock bottom , through no fault of their own , then get shafted because they ca n't afford a hospital bill . 
  that 's inhuman . 
  `` i do n't believe if ideas are tenacious it means that they 're worthy '' hell , i 'm no activist , and i 'm definitely no vegetarian , but i still think it 's a hangover from a far older , barbaric time . 
  but people cling on to it claiming it 's `` culture '' and `` tradition '' , despite the fact that it 's outright cruel . 
  i did feel sorry for the scots getting blanket labelled as english, 
  major props to caunes for the jacket & cardigan , he looked and sounded like he should have been on a british panel show . 
  a badger could give you a nasty nip ...

  it 's not sunday though , are you mad ? 
  you ca n't just eat a sunday roast on a thursday !, 
  you crazy yanks ... 
  care to elaborate why ? 
  have you seen what we look like after a weekend of boozing ? 
  it 's a matter of popular hilarity here that the [ bnp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_national_party ) , our own home-grown nationalist party , featured a spitfire in one of their anti-immigration posters . 
  that spitfire [ turned out to be from the polish squadron ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/4935429/bnp-uses-polish-spitfire-in-anti-immigration-poster.html )  seriously , you guys kicked fucking arse man . 
  considering that 58.66 % of people voted , even if 100 % voted it would still have been a majority . 
  i 'm not sure how you can conflate that with the falklands though . 
  they have completely autonomous governance . 
  well , there was a referendum in northern ireland in 1973 where 98.9 % of voters stated they wanted to remain a part of the uk . 
  as such i 'd hardly call it `` occupy '' as they wish to remain british . 
  whether there should have been a need for such a vote in the first place is a darker question , of course . 
  i very sadly agree with you . 
  unfortunately ( as i 'm sure it is with most countries ) we have a number of xenophobic prats that control a lot of our media . 
  the moment we play germany in any form of sports the tabloids are plastered with war references . 
  i prefer to view it as that we fought the nazis in wwii , rather than the germans . 
  i 've known many germans and visited a few times and always loved it . 
  germans and brits are far more similar than most people ever know . 
  drinking competitions can be a hazardous challenge for both parties . 
  that said , i 've been pleased to see improvements . 
  when you last hosted the world cup there was some great camaraderie going on , and when we crashed out to portugal most fans abroad happily started rooting for germany , 
  meh , i 've never liked the phrase personally . 
  i know there was a lot of post-war rivalry still going on , but in my mind i equate the 1966 world cup victory as one over germany , and world war ii as a victory over the nazis . 
  very good point indeed , something i 'd overlooked despite it being the centrepiece of the olympics opening ceremony last year . 
  once you start researching the troubles , you swiftly realise there 's still a lot of bad we 've done in the world within living memory . 
  there were certainly some things you can be proud of during that though !, 
  [ oskar schindler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oskar_schindler ) was german , for instance . 
  change takes time to effect , particularly when the church as an institution is so ingrained in society . 
  still , as a symbolic gesture , it was a powerful one , bringing comfort to many who had been adversely affected by the church 's deeds . 
  you kidding ? 
  i did a mental `` fuck yeah '' to ireland when i read about it on the news . 
  i wish more national leaders had the backbone to call shit like that out . 
  technically , [ it still does n't ] ( http://what-if.xkcd.com/48/ ) . 
  still , having studied some of the things we did , eg : in india , at school , i ca n't help but feel disdain for people who still take pride in it . 
  we 've shat on most countries in the world over the years : /, 
  eh , that 's not something to be that proud of . 
  we had a [ war with china ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opium_wars ) to keep supplies coming as we were shipping opium over there and they wanted us to stop . 
  that we once ruled over most of the planet . 
  conveniently , most people * now forget the numerous atrocities we committed in order to get to that position . 
  also , our roles in both world wars . 
  a lonely island holding off the nazis for years until we could push back . 
  * edit : when i say `` most people '' , i 'm referring to my fellow brits, 
  that 's literally the opposite timeline of what op 's source says . 
  oh i 'm certainly not excusing the man nor saying it could have been handled differently , merely suggesting that the guy who did get shot got a nice batch of karma . 
  so they were banging on his doors & windows yelling at him to come out for a fight . 
  and he fired at the ground to try and scare them off , and one of them was accidentally hit ? 
  can understand that the police would n't have much latitude with turning a blind eye on this one , but damn , that 's asking for it . 
  not too far off , awesome , 
  i 'd guess at `` hc-odd-ver-dom '' . 
  leading ` g 's in dutch seem to generally be back-of-the-throat noises . 
  that ... is beautiful . 
  i must remember this . 
  i think frankeh means more that no-one would use `` bloody wanker '' in this situation . 
  `` bloody wanker '' is for someone who has been a bit foolish or annoying . 
  `` fucking wanker '' is for far more egregious deeds , such as this . 
  trying to encourage a pun thread ? 
  that 's just peachy . 
  indeed - i was definitely expecting to see the netherlands ranked ahead of us here . 
  still , nice to see the uk coming out scoring well on something like this , 
  so should we take everything the golden dawn say as being indicative of all greeks ? 
  tried that . 
  they complimented me . 
  in english . 
  the only complaint i could ever have about the netherlands is how many people default to english . 
  i want to practise my dutch , damnit !, 
  stop being so accommodating by speaking my language !, 
  you must have only been introduced to very cheap and nasty pat\u00e9 then . 
  it 's delicious stuff . 
  sorry about that . 
  we do try and stop them from heading to the mainland , but there 's only so many we can hold back at once . 
   yeah , enforcing legal contracts is oppression !, 
  right guys ?? 
  not meaning to invoke godwin 's law , but everything hitler did was legal due to laws he passed . 
  does that mean it was n't oppression ? 
  yup , i would n't argue with any of these depictions . 
  it 's a portuguese man o ' war . 
  gave me a good chuckle . 
  we 're trying !, 
  chinese is the most widely spoken language in the world . 
  spanish is next . 
  english is third . 
  i was n't meaning to comment on this specific situation , merely to refute your point that we never have a right to violence .
