  sweden is one of those countries , fyi . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-defense_ ( sweden ) no , a fight wo n't fix a car , but that is n't what i said . 
   all i know is there 's no way i would resort to violence in a situation like that ok ? 
  many people * are * willing to resort to violence , and in many countries a violent response to some situations is perfectly acceptable . 
  anyone saying that one side or another `` can not lose '' is lying to themselves . 
  it is in no way a foregone conclusion already . 
   that is schizophrenic behavior . 
  you 're anthropomorphising an entire continent . 
  in reality , * some * people want germany to be leaders , some * other * people yell that their nazis , and * other people again * do n't feel either of these positions . 
  europe does n't need a psychiatrist . 
  it is just filled with people with different views . 
  that 's not inherently a bad thing . 
  he 's said that he will not be campaigning for an exit . 
  we had some [ crazy dresses ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6pfafv5.jpg ) over the years . 
  look at how damn many pearls and gems are all over that thing . 
   in black mirror it ends a prime ministers career . 
  quite the opposite , actually . 
  the public 's opinion of him is actually raised . 
  damn this has turned into food porn , my god i 'm hungry . 
  and people take the piss out of british food , hah, 
  we 're big fans of croissants for breakfast as well , but nothing quite beats a plate covered in greasy , fried , oil-dripping pig meats and blood , with all the trimmings . 
  are you even reading his comment ? 
  he literally says '' * especially america * '' should be doing this . 
  we have experience in using islands as prisons . 
  we ended up creating australia . 
  you really want another australia ? 
  i meant that the royals being involved in the current round of scandals is n't a thing , and diana being killed due to knowledge of it is so out there that it 's comical . 
   but the conspiracy part is that this involves members of the royal family ( mountbatten ) and that maybe , diana 's death is a result of her knowing too much and being a loose cannon . 
  where the hell did that come from ? 
  first time i 've heard it . 
  you . 
  i like you . 
  a german ? 
  making a joke ? 
  in / r/europe ? 
  i mean , if that 's their tradition then fair enough , but damn if that does n't scream out `` tacky hillbilly redneck '' to me to have the seals on there . 
  money laundering and similar enterprises . 
   mom ? 
  if you were in a german `` scheisse '' video , you ... you 'd tell me , right ? 
  that 's vile slander . 
  though we 're all impressed you 've now got internet connections in your vardos , 
  seriously , if they 're not overcooked then they 're pretty tasty . 
  just miniature cabbages basically . 
   no one died because of this accident . 
  pretty sure there were a [ fair few deaths ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deaths_due_to_the_chernobyl_disaster ) because of this accident . 
  because our country gives various benefits to people couples who are married . 
  it 's not the same as any other relationship - it 's also a legal contract . 
  yup , you guys kicked some major arse . 
  it 's still a point of amusement here that a few years ago , one of our loony far-right parties produced a `` battle for britain '' anti-immigration poster featuring a spitfire . 
  the spitfire in question [ happened to be from a polish squadron ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/4935429/bnp-uses-polish-spitfire-in-anti-immigration-poster.html ) . 
  that , and anyone who has read up about the [ battle of wizna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_wizna ) ca n't have anything but respect for the polish forces . 
   i think the language barrier with europe deceives most people into thinking that we 're more culturally different than we are . 
  absolutely . 
  head to a bar in germany and you will very quickly feel right at home . 
  i would heartily recommend fantasia on british sea songs by sir henry wood . 
  a traditional part of the last night of the proms each year , it 's at the same time pompous yet frivolous , serious and fun . 
  i like to think it sums us up pretty well . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuxbrek5n9g - 4:27 for the traditionally raucous jack 's the lad , and 11:53 for the iconic rule britannia, 
  the current curriculum requires having some basic foreign language abilities at key stage 2 ( years 3-6 ) , but certainly not from the age of 5 . 
  true , but a kettle has featured in every british tank since 1945 , before we had rations in this style . 
  and then you 're in the perfect situation to retaliate against whatever heathen is interrupting a good brew, 
  i quite like that all of our tanks have tea making facilities on board . 
  possibly that it 's not really relevant ? 
  it 's like saying it 's a european town surrounded by european territory - factual , but does n't really add anything . 
  the two definitions are not mutually exclusive . 
  well , you had to get your inspiration from * somewhere *, 
  yup . 
  any silly stories about massacres or death camps are probably just a case of boys being boys . 
  fak you !, 
  taiwan numba too !, 
  there 's always one ... 
  is this some form of false-flag operation by the leave campaign ? 
  why before if you 'll wash them again immediately afterwards ? 
  you know the word `` discrimination '' has been in the dictionary long before the word `` racism '' was , right ? 
  crazy weather we 're having lately !, 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-29004253  so has qatar funded islamic state ? 
  directly , the answer is no . 
  indirectly , a combination of shoddy policy and naivety has led to qatar-funded weapons and money making their way into the hands of is . 
  it 's the eu equivalent of article 5 , essentially . 
  the rest of the replies to that tweet appear to be alleging that those are old images , not from this strike . 
  well , [ wiggins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bradley_wiggins ) ? 
  but he 's hardly in anyone 's bad books as op suggests . 
  since when was he `` disgraced '' ? 
  honestly , i do n't see a way at this moment that some form of increased warfare is n't inevitable . 
  words ca n't begin to express our feelings tonight . 
  all our thoughts are with france . 
  what an horrific , terrible night . 
  yup , and they 're paying hundreds of millions in interest each year now due to the imf loan they then needed to take . 
  caveat : heavy rounding applied , not intended as an actual professional financial analysis . 
  i am not an economist . 
  rbs was bailed out for ~ [ # 45bil ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/rbs-sale-fred-goodwin-bailout-years-of-losses ) uk 's gdp is ~ [ # 1.9 tril ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_kingdom ) scotland 's gnp is ~ [ # 157bil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_scotland ) bearing in mind there may be differences of opinion over the methodology of some of these figures , but taking them as an example , bailing out rbs cost the uk ~ 2 % of its gdp . 
  if scotland had bailed them out by themselves , it would have cost them ~ 28 % of their gdp . 
  that 's a damn gigantic difference . 
  you produced one of the greatest military geniuses in history , stop whining !, 
  honestly , what i 've written just scratches the surface of some of the shit he got up to . 
  [ christopher lee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christopher_lee ) . 
  a decorated veteran of wwii , who was a part of what would later form the sas . 
  much of his service records are still sealed and classified . 
  he went on to be an iconic image in the film world , initially starring in many hammer horror titles the title role in a series of dracula films . 
  he was a trained fencer and performed his own stunts through most of his career , which went on to include blockbusters such as the lord of the rings , star wars , james bond , and a laundry list of major hollywood titles .
