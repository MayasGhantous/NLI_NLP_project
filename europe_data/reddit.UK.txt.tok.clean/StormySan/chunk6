  proctor !, 
  humans are natural . 
  humans made technology . 
  therefore , technology is natural !, 
  that 's what the [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right-_and_left-hand_traffic ) says , but you 're right , it means 35 % of countries . 
  cross-referencing [ this list of populations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population ) and [ this list of left/right driving ] ( http://www.worldstandards.eu/cars/list-of-left-driving-countries/ ) gives a total left-side driving population of nearer to 24 % of the world 's population . 
   most of the city center is intact new buildings were built afterwards , but it 's been over 50 years since the blitz , we did n't just leave it as rubble . 
  the centre of london had plenty of bombing occur too , and lost many famous & historic buildings . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_demolished_buildings_and_structures_in_london not to say that we had it worse than germany as , well , they ended up being invaded and a lot of retaliation went into the bombing campaigns . 
  but it was far , * far * from `` mostly ok '' . 
   london was mostly ok london had the everliving crap bombed out of it . 
  over a million homes were damaged or demolished by the blitz in london alone . 
  russia invaded finland during wwii . 
  there were hundreds of thousands of casualties from that invasion alone . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war  norway norway was invaded & occupied by germany . 
  portugal remained officially neutral through the war and emerged not only physically intact but a fair bit wealthier as they could trade with both sides . 
  especially notable considering that , despite their official stance , they provided tacit help to the allies through the war . 
  seems to be predominantly peaceful so far , thankfully . 
  we 're 4th on per capita golds . 
  which is still pretty nice . 
  new zealand take 1st , latvia 2nd , netherlands 3rd . 
  similar situation for brum tbh  though very little need to head down to big smoke . 
  says the man in wales ... 
  that one confuses me as well - malta are a member of the commonwealth . 
  the m6 does n't reach the south , thus is considered irrelevant . 
   it has more people that 's kinda the definition of what a second city is . 
  it was very close here - 50.4 % for leave . 
  it 's easy to visit a city and manage to miss the best bits  i moved to birmingham 10 years ago ; it was rough around the edges a lot but still had a lot of greenery . 
  it 's seen gigantic levels of investment over recent years though , and the tech sector here is thriving . 
  if you find yourself this way again , stop by / r/brum and check the [ wiki page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/brum/wiki/guide ) we have for visitors , it has a good few tips on things to see and places to go !, 
  a mightily snobby video , but it does have a point . 
  most of the rest of the country 's perceptions of brum seem to lag about 20 years behind where it 's actually at . 
  fantastic place to be these days . 
  this is n't a new thing . 
  various tourist groups have been pulling this crap for decades . 
  it 's more the burning of the towels that is a new retaliation . 
  google translate of the article :  after makarska , guidance and tisnog , municipalities via also met with the problem of crowded beaches , which individuals are trying to figure out a way to place `` book '' leaving towels overnight on the beach or in turn returns at dawn . 
  some villagers revolted by such procedures , but they burned towels , writes portal our \u0160kolji . 
   the worst situation is the most famous and most popular prije\u0161koj jaz beach , where the municipality two years ago set a deck chair . 
  but from the early morning , there is no room because they were all occupied by those who think they are entitled to it because the day before on `` his '' hammock left a towel . 
   the situation is similar to the beaches of preko to ugljan . 
  some of them loungers are tied with chains , and the locals are already twice , according to the municipality over , took matters into their own hands and picked up dozens of towels and set them on fire . 
   `` every day we get calls of disgruntled locals and guests . 
  on some beaches can not find a place even when there is almost no one . 
  we have to stop this , and in line with our decision on communal order , municipal utilities stewards began early in the morning by removing the `` reservation '' to the beach , and the owners of my things may come to the municipal building . 
   in this way we keep and their things , because we do not want to go away or being burned again . 
  as much as this bother some people , must understand that this is public land , the line has to know , and even more appreciated . 
  the public area must be accessible to everyone , `` he stressed the mayor of charles novoselic . 
  repeating the same point over and over is not a valid counterargument . 
  they are n't going for a swim . 
  they 're putting their towels down the night before , expecting that it means they have the right to the spot when the sun 's up the next day . 
  it 's on the frontpage of the bbc website - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36880758, 
  they 're going to have to try a lot harder to get on to our level , 
   they 're one of the big nordics one of ? 
  they 're * the * biggest nordic nation . 
  nearly twice the population of the next biggest . 
  rtfa . 
  they are involved in a number of monopolistic business practices . 
  it 's an effective monopoly , rather than a pure one . 
  google 's hold on the market is firm enough that competitors can not make inroads . 
  people equate searching with google , hence why people use the term `` googling '' instead of `` searching '' . 
  much the same as with microsoft 's censure over internet explorer - they did n't have a pure monopoly in that there were other browser options available , but they had an effective monopoly in people thinking ie = * the * internet browser that it was more than enough for them to be fined over it and forced to loosen their push of ie to windows users . 
  neither analogy is perfect , but as it was a non-binding referendum i 'd suggest it 's closer to my example than yours . 
  this is more like the family of the wife all telling her she should get a divorce , and the husband knows they have told her , but she has n't said anything to the husband over it yet . 
  it 's only controversial amongst certain niche groups of cyclists . 
  most cyclists in the uk either do n't care ( about road safety & road laws in general ) , or would n't leave home without one . 
   the self centeredness of english media i mean i know our media is a pile of tripe , but i 'm pretty sure this is american ... 
  he believes in homeopathy , promotes bullshit detox products , and has actually lobbied politicians to get `` alternative medicine '' funded on the nhs . 
  i was cycling from land 's end to john o'groats at the time of the referendum . 
  i saw a lot of signs across the country , for both sides . 
  the earth literally exploding would have less impact on britain 's economy . 
  i think part of it is less what the eu has done , and more what london has done . 
  a tremendous amount of uk policy is london-centric . 
  london really does not reflect the rest of the country . 
  scotland has retorted to this with strongly nationalistic politics , and sees the eu as an ally against london . 
  northern ireland politics are damn complex but at the risk of dumbing things down , there 's a broadly similar situation .
