well , yeah , it does actually . 
  you 're enabling the exploitation of other people , because the only way big corporations will stop is if the public wo n't stand for it and vote with their wallets . 
  you 're practically encouraging it . 
  but by your attitude towards mrs thatcher ; i guess `` it 's just good business '' to you . 
  or if your family were in the mining trade . 
  my family moved from sheffield to the south after she tore through the area like a tornado . 
  i do think we need more housing here . 
  preferably in the form of new towns rather than high rises . 
  i 'm a supporter of the eu as well . 
  the majority of this area though are older people who blame the eu for everything from immigrants to potholes to bad weather . 
  therefore it 's rather tough for the government to actually build here . 
  they 'll build over up north or in croydon instead where the labour voters are . 
  exactly . 
  the extreme victorian decadence of chelsea , westminster , kensington and knightsbridge ; the `` rough around the edges '' feel of soho , shoreditch and camden , the suburban charm of the outer regions , the striking futuristic towers of the city , all in one place . 
  not to mention the blend of cultures and traditions that the guy above clearly does n't like ; if you want something , you can find it in london , we have the whole world here . 
  all that would go in place of more soulless tower blocks . 
  you try telling that to the people around here . 
  they will shout about the devaluation of their houses , blame it on immigrants and threaten to vote ukip if the government builds here , so the north will take the brunt of the new construction even though this is the area that needs it . 
  to be fair , i 'm surprised reigate made it to 2015 without being swallowed by the lovecraftian behemoth that is greater london . 
  liquid & amp ; envy in redhill is being demolished to make way for luxury flats though , so i think this may the year . 
  as someone who used to live in the shadow of stuttgart 21 ; ugh . 
  or 1980 , when thatcher got elected , depending upon who you speak to . 
  whilst i agree to an extent , all of the things that make london the unique city it is would be promptly demolished though . 
  soho , camden , shoreditch , etc would be gone , to make way for more tower blocks . 
  as for new towns in the south east , the south east ( aside from brighton and hove ) is full of people who prop up the conservative party and are at a risk of moving to ukip , and generally are `` nimby '' about it all ( i live in reigate , i can just imagine how it would go down here ) . 
  not in a million years are they going to risk that when they could build over the north or shout about immigrants instead . 
  it 's a big festival in bad canstatt . 
  [ here 's the website for it . 
  ] ( http://cannstatter-volksfest.de/en/landing-page/ ) its one of the biggest in germany . 
  do n't forget the volksfest in stuttgart !, 
  i remember liechtenstein had one , on the outskirts of vaduz . 
  i wonder how many they have per million . 
  i expect it 's similar to andorra . 
  interestingly enough you could pay with euros or francs , but the prices were horrendous so we just went to the supermarket . 
  i never signed up . 
  my best friend knows i 'm a lib dem. , though . 
  my bets are on that he signed me up , along with the ukip mailing list , and some rather `` interesting '' dating sites . 
  this is why you lock your computer when your best friend is around . 
  do people other than daily mail readers say `` eussr '' ? 
  even ukip do n't say that . 
  as older people are more likely to vote conservative , the government is more likely to do whatever they want and bollocks to the rest . 
  due to the small minority this government got ( 3 mps i believe ) they are also more likely to be sympathetic to ukip voters , and doing whatever it is that ukip voters would want in order to try to bring them back ( as they will be easier to pull ukip voters towards the centre rather than pulling lib dems , labour and greens to the right ) . 
  the media in the uk , particularly rupert murdoch 's `` the sun '' has done a good job of breeding this fear within the working class of a `` beast '' called `` immigration '' that will destroy your jobs * and * benefits simultaneously , whilst the government and rich people * only * work in your best interests . 
  they had it prepared at least a month in advance , probably . 
  corbyn was the favourite for a while . 
  i was surprised it took so long to come through . 
  i 'm on the conservative party mailing list for some reason . 
  well , the sun , daily mail , telegraph and express will be running these materials solidly for the next 5 years . 
  helena fischer , the source of our sore throats and the enforcement of noise regulations at oktoberfest last year , is russian . 
  another one to add to the list for germany . 
  i know you keep finding them , i got held up [ by this one in leipzig last year ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20140612/wwii-bomb-exploded-in-leipzig-germany ) . 
  that was american though ; at least when we wanted to kill each other we were generally more successful at it . 
  a lot of british people , particularly older people and working class people according to the polls want to get rid of it entirely rather than change it . 
  when you guys build stuff you build it to last , at least . 
  you guys built some [ very pretty cars ] ( http://images.gizmag.com/inline/auction-1938-mercedes-benz-540k-special-roadster-nawrocki-79@2x.jpg ) back then as well . 
  pity they 're so horrendously expensive nowadays . 
  its the telegraph , they 'll be actively trying to derail chances of the uk staying in . 
  they went downmarket into daily mail territory a while back ; sources are n't necessary to print a story ( which is what it often is ) any more . 
  come one , come all , see clacton on sea , and experience life in the 1950s !, 
  experience being told to `` fuck off back where you came from '' by a pensioner , despite being born only just down the road from them !, 
  experience the cultural wonders of fish and chips , pie and chips , ham and chips , or chips and chips ( and none of that evil foreign shit ) !, 
  live a life dictated to you by the express !, 
  be told about how `` we won a war '' !, 
  clacton has it all !, 
  they would n't integrate . 
  they 'd build fences and spend all day reading the express , complaining about foreigners . 
  there 's some logistical issues ; kent and sussex would likely crash into france , east anglia into denmark , and clacton on sea into the netherlands . 
  marine le pen and the fn . 
  i do n't see it happening . 
  we have a deficit to plug , do n't you know ? 
  `` all in this together '' and all that . 
  it 's interesting is n't it . 
  they stand the most to lose , and yet they 're the areas that the most eurosceptic people live . 
  it started in leeds and would have been down to numerous factors , but let 's blame immigration as that 's the flavour of the month . 
  have you considered sending a job application to the express ? 
  yup . 
  [ nigel farage bankrolled the campaign to force a referendum . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/06/eurocrats-investigate-deal-backed-by-nigel-farage-behind-dutch-r/ ), 
  our hausmeister at university in germany was called herr zorn ( literally : mr grumpy ) ; it was the most fitting name he could have had . 
  why ca n't we have smoking rooms with seperate ventilation systems and an `` airlock '' corridor between the smoking room and the rest of the club ? 
  you see that a lot in germany . 
  [ you sure about that ? 
  ] ( https://www.gov.uk/guidance/civil-service-fast-stream-summer-diversity-internship-programme ) and i 'm what you would probably refer to as a `` pro-eu lefty '' . 
  [ farage tried to warn us !, 
  ] ( http://news.bfnn.co.uk/britain-sinking-under-weight-of-immigrants/ ), 
  only ukip can save us ( by causing food prices to go up ) !, 
  so that we can blame the eu for port talbot closing , silly . 
  i used to live in reutlingen , and my best friend lives a short walk away from storzingen . 
  i used to pass this regularly . 
  it 's even more beautiful [ in the snow . 
  ] ( http://drscdn.500px.org/photo/99158697/m=2048/9840cdc098bfdaf4620ecb11eeccb4f3 ), 
  our local one likes trump , pegida , etc. 
  he 's an `` isolated incident '' waiting to happen . 
  great work !, 
  i hope you get to visit more cities and make more designs . 
  i like these more than the current ones ... 
  yeah but he 's appealing to the sort of demographic in the uk that does n't believe that . 
  our local ukip representative wants to invite trump to the city as he 's `` a true hero '' . 
  says it all really . 
  ah , on that one , many people down here ( i 'm from surrey ) said `` i wish we could declare independence from scotland .
