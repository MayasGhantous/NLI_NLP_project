  i 've had enough of their constant whining and holding us back . 
  all they do is complain , even though they have it better than anyone else . '', 
  the exact same view is held by some of the uk . 
  [ here 's some satire ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/international/rest-of-europe-wants-referendum-on-britain-2014011482542 ) and [ here is a comical german view . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zih3l3xpjhy ), 
  from what i can gather from my friends in other eu countries , it 's everyone else saying `` you made your bed , mr farage and friends , now lie in it . 
  you wanted to be totally on your own , well here you go . '', 
  and you probably would have found a resounding `` yes '' . 
  there 's quite a bit of exceptionalism here . 
  this is pretty much why , whenever i go to the rest of europe , i pretend to be german ( helps that i speak the language and am a 1.85 m blond ) . 
  brits have the worst reputation by far around the continent for being drunk and disorderly . 
  as for my town ( london ) ; our worst tourists ? 
  the british again . 
  you never see the french or whoever starting a fight outside a nightclub . 
  it 's benefited me greatly and i love it . 
  i 'll be pissed if i 'm forced out of it . 
  i live just outside of kent , the homeland of nigel farage , and i agree with the above completely . 
  i think germany . 
  we have similar mindsets , and apart from about 20 years of the last century , we have been allies for far longer with germany and prussia before it , over our mutual dislike of france . 
  our language is closely related to german , our eating and drinking habits are pretty similar ( there is n't a war on ; nobody in england boils meat and vegetables any more ) and we go to the same places on holiday . 
  thats the one . 
  gaze upon the glory that is [ port talbot . 
  ] ( http://i4.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article1871542.ece/alternates/s615b/port-talbot-275909481.jpg ), 
  [ the house of soviets in kaliningrad ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/dom_sovetov.jpg ) will always win in russia for me . 
  yup , my hometown was cheaply rebuilt with `` temporary '' buildings after the war . 
  they 're still standing . 
  [ one got listed as a `` stunning example of brutalism '' ] ( https://municipaldreams.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/civic-centre-and-council-house-c-plymouth-man1.jpg ) because the council wanted to demolish it . 
  but i want to stay !, 
  i 'm more european than `` british '' for starters , i speak 3 european languages and am learning a fourth , i work across borders already and i want to move to italy when i 'm old . 
  out of question , could the eu do * anything * that would not make you want to leave ? 
  you seem to be one of the biggest proponents of brexit on reddit , so i 'm curious . 
  maidenhead has taken zero ? 
  co-incidentally the mp for maidenhead is theresa may . 
  they could stick them in some towns up in the north where there are literally whole streets sitting empty , but then that would mean the government would have to start investing outside of london and getting businesses to do the same . 
  they could also build more styles of property than `` luxury apartments '' that sell for more than # 1m , or admit that # 400k is not a `` starter home '' . 
  my folks moved out of london , sold their 1.5 bed flat and bought a detached house in the south west . 
  they were able to do that as they 're lucky enough to be in jobs that also exist outside of london . 
  the british housing market and employment markets are completely fucked . 
  but it 's easier to blame immigration than to actually fix the fact that london has become a black hole . 
  you obviously havent walked into a corner shop and seen the mail , express and sun out on display in the last couple of weeks . 
  they 're nothing * but * about immigration . 
  [ yup . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsdgpuduacw ), 
  this is even more trashy than [ the american version . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nujzxr_5gqe ), 
  shh , do n't give the colonials reasons to feel good about themselves . 
  i would n't say that . 
  when people realise that the express was lying and the eu * was n't * the cause of everything wrong in the country , who are they going to blame ? 
  farage ? 
  themselves ? 
  the stagnation of the economy and what that means in real terms will mean people will want back in . 
  question is then if the rest of the eu is willing to let in a new member who just whines at everything and demands special treatment ? 
  i imagine there are , but its the part of europe i havent been to yet , so i 'd like to go for something new . 
  i 'd say probably norway or sweden the most as i 've done southern and eastern europe . 
  i 've never been to russia either which would be very interesting . 
  i do n't know for the least . 
  all the countries i never want to set foot in are outside europe . 
  saudi arabia ? 
  pretty much . 
  at uni as soon as it went over about 30 in the summer the jeans / shorts were off in the house . 
  the irony being that in britain at least , the ones who are the most proud of the colonial past , tend to be the ones who fear immigrants the most . 
  i think it 's a play on no matter what it is ; `` if it 's good the eu must be trying to hold it back , and if it 's bad the eu is responsible - source nigel farage and the daily mail '', 
  i hate to say it but it 'll probably be a leave vote . 
  the printed media has deluded people into thinking that leaving will stop the refugee crisis , and ukip have only fuelled the fire . 
  and yet they all listen to farage , a privately educated metals trader turned politician . 
  hardly the `` man of the people '' . 
  i 'm near the border with kent . 
  folks across the border could not care less about the economic consequences , so long as it means less immigration . 
  they wo n't want to be in the eea . 
  the eea has freedom of movement , which i think we can all agree is the primary fear of ukip voters . 
  nothing that allows freedom of movement would be accepted by the uk if it votes out . 
  get in line , frankfurt and paris are already at the front of the queue to carve up the banking sector . 
  you 'll even hear it being played in the clubs , albeit in a more modern version . 
  my local nightclubs are proof that this one is n't followed at all . 
  basically , you can get in if you 're not an asshole , and you can get drinks if you 're not an asshole . 
  rest is good to go . 
  followed by the scene where he remarks that at the fall of the ussr , a lot of weapons `` went missing '' due to generals and other military figures not being paid and finding out their pensions were worth nothing . 
  i 'm actually ashamed to share a nationality with someone so toxic as you . 
  being from near kent , i 'm saddened to be aware that you 're not alone in this attitude . 
  no , you the ukip voters did n't want to let them in . 
  as you 're all so `` christian '' , can you think of a seasonally-appropriate story , today on christmas day , about a middle eastern family desperately seeking refuge in the cold night , only for some heartless `` i 'm alright so fuck you '' bastard to say `` nope . 
  we 're full . '', 
  and slam the door shut rather than be a human being and do everything within their power to help those who are desperately in need ? 
  ah we have a few of them . 
  about 4 million at the last count . 
  it 's quite depressing really . 
  they think that co-operation with our neighbours rather than isolation and division is somehow a * bad * thing . 
  no you 're right . 
  dave is n't letting refugees in . 
  he 's bombing syria , making more of them . 
  then leaving greece , italy and others to clean up the mess because he needs to look `` tough on immigration '' for the ukip voters . 
  i 'm on my phone , so i 'm going to assume that the individual trying to cause division and bring up immigration is a compatriot of mine ? 
  godfrey bloom , roger helmer , nigel farage ; ukip have many to offer in this department . 
  the only conservative who really stands up to this level is boris . 
  we would say lapland ; not sure how many know that lapland is in finland though . 
  as the site of many battles , and now where the european parliament is located , it pretty much is . 
  i was quite impressed with how highly the uk rates cameron . 
  you 're right . 
  they were running with that since the eu became a thing . 
  the daily mail as well , which is interesting as in the 1930s they supported the idea of a united europe under german rule ...
