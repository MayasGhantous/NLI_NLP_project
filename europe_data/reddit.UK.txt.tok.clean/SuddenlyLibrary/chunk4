  yup . 
  i know my county ( surrey ) , the ones around it , and a few others like devon , somerset , wiltshire , cornwall , norfolk , suffolk and yorkshire . 
  the rest i would struggle to put on the map . 
  ah come now , unless you 're from the uk or usa you must be able to speak at least two languages , simply because you 're talking in english right now . 
  i 'm from the uk . 
  i speak fluent french and a reasonable standard of german ; enough to hold a conversation . 
  i also know basic italian . 
  i want to learn russian next . 
  we have pretty high internet coverage . 
  chances are one or two of them will discover reddit eventually . 
  my favourite phrase in polish is `` nie m\u00f3j cyrk , nie moje ma\u0142py '' , literally `` not my circus , not my monkey '' , meaning `` not my problem '' . 
  i wish i could say i 'm surprised . 
  i was at least expecting some questions to do with the structure in there ... generally the only things a lot of people here know about the eu are whatever farage and the daily mail tells them about it . 
  here is [ taikatalvi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qlmp3l0jjc ) by nightwish ( finland ) . 
  in english it means `` the magic of winter '' . 
  whilst the composer was american , if there were ever a depressing , bleak piece of music to go with the harshness of a ( northern / central ) european winter , it would for me have to be [ the main theme from schindler 's list ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0oxe2voq6i ) . 
  oxbridge , lse , imperial , warwick , durham , st andrews and ucl . 
  beyond that i find it hard to justify # 9k per year . 
  well i am nothing if not a true european . 
  i have boxers with the designs of 100 $ and 500 $ notes on them . 
  they go well with the union jack socks . 
  my concern is that if i am living in another eu state at the time of the referendum , as is currently the intent , i 'm screwed . 
  also about 2 million brits live in other eu states , that 's quite a lot . 
  farage seems to like to avoid the topic of them . 
  it just makes me sad that because of the fear and hatred that the printed media and certain politicians have incited within certain demographics of the population , i may have to change my citizenship if i want any promotion prospects . 
  i could end up needing a visa to visit the town i was born in because of this . 
  does n't it seem wrong to you that someone may have to cast off an important part of them in order to maintain their lifestyle , due to the fear of others ? 
  and what of uk citizens who live abroad ? 
  or is it just `` fuck them '' ? 
  i can believe it . 
  it was n't long before suzanne evans ( as a more palatable face than farage ) was out blaming it on the eu and immigration . 
  same with our dear friends the mail and express . 
  nah , more likely a litre of paulaner hefeweizen that did n't do well on the journey . 
  `` the eu causes cancer '' is their dream headline . 
  in england it has to be rugby . 
  not sure what would come after that . 
  along with the festkultur . 
  needs a sign for # 15 beer or # 5 `` bratwurst '' in there somewhere . 
  would n't be london without rip off prices . 
  i personally would have dropped london and put either munich , heidelberg or rothenburg ob der tauber in its place . 
  all of them are much nicer than what is basically a `` german '' market with heavily overpriced beer and very expensive `` bratwurst '' . 
  i 'm quite a fan of the market in esslingen as well , it has a properly medieval feel . 
  yeah , on bbc4 i think . 
  the prime minister is fair , the mps however are a little overdoing it considering they get 10 % ish pay rises whilst the rest of us are lucky to get 2 % . 
  the rise of anti-immigration parties , that speech by theresa may , and immigration being called the `` top concern '' of a huge section of the population suggests that this is changing , however . 
  with the uk 's working conditions for doctors going down the drain , combined with the general dislike of foreigners the country is going through , that could quite easily change . 
  on a related note , the salary for an mp is # 74,000 per year plus expenses . 
  select committee chairs are on # 89,025 . 
  a cabinet minister is on # 134,565 per year . 
  the prime minister is on # 142,500 . 
  the speaker is on # 150,236 . 
  france : les revenants sweden : wallander . 
  germany : stromberg . 
  i also watched `` unsere m\u00fcttern , unsere v\u00e4tern '' when it was on . 
  my mum watches don matteo ( italy ) and tatort ( germany ) as well . 
  soko is also her type of show but she has n't started on that one yet . 
  it would never happen . 
  some of the commonwealth nations ( particularly australia ) are even more tetchy about freedom of movement than the uk . 
  the thatcher government made it so that companies can strongarm you into opting out yourself , but only in certain industries i believe . 
  [ dave wants to abolish it entirely asap , though . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11732668/david-cameron-working-time-directive-eu-referendum.html ) the brexit lot see its abolishment as a `` victory for the working man '' ... god i hate the attitude in this country sometimes . 
  `` live to work '' rather than `` work to live '' . 
  a common breakfast for me . 
  lavazza , gauloises ; i thank you . 
  nah , rt is quite popular amongst the british far right , as well . 
  we 'll be a bit darker once dave gets his tax credits cuts through . 
  because there is so much shit about the eu that the british tabloids make up . 
  the daily mail , daily express and sun are particularly guilty of this . 
  tabloid journalism has given the eu a free pass ? 
  are you * sure * you 're from the uk ? 
  try picking up the daily mail , daily express , daily star , telegraph , or sun . 
  actually , just read the headlines so you do n't give any of them money . 
  the eu is the biggest scapegoat going ; it even was when ed miliband was around . 
  preu\u00dfen , bayern , w\u00fcrttemberg , etc do n't have the friendliest of histories . 
  the fact it took until the 1800s to unify them speaks a lot about their differences . 
  same goes for italy . 
  i think he 's referring to the fact that it is traditionally england , in particular the south eastern county of kent , that is where the hardline eurosceptics are generally found , as opposed to scotland or wales . 
  i can see why they 're doing it , but only time will tell if it makes it any better . 
  we jail hungarians for them , though . 
  maybe a big prisoner swap ? 
  or a big trade of the invoices ? 
  we had `` black sites '' along with the cia in poland and morocco before , i believe it was . 
  we should just open one in a remote part of north wales . 
  yup , my 91 year old grandma thinks her children 's generation is the most selfish , ungrateful generation to ever walk this earth , in britain at least . 
  `` we went through a war to give them everything . 
  they 've spent their lives taking it away from everyone who comes after them '', 
  agreed . 
  however as i 'm british by passport , i need to decide quickly before the ability to decide is taken away from me via brexit . 
  we are with you , our brothers and sisters from across the channel . 
  moved to the uk again from germany . 
  the tea tastes so much better but the beer tastes so much worse here . 
  also , uk bureaucracy is not nearly as bad as i remember it being before germany . 
  still not sure if i want to be in the uk or germany in the long term ... 
  he 'd probably rather she compared herself to farage than him . 
  why not ? 
  she pushes for the same thing you want after all ; an end to the eu for her country . 
  in this country it 's true , that `` the greatest generation gave birth to the worst generation '' . 
  those who lived through wwii fought in the 1940s and 50s to give their children everything , who have since spent their lives trying to take all of that away from their children . 
  who has n't shown up to a dissection class extremely hungover / still drunk ? 
  i know i have !,
