  the whole `` criticizing the country is treason '' is a very standard far right view . 
  `` criticising the county is treason '' is a pretty far right view , but is n't held by many people . 
  however , `` it 's kind of obvious that they are n't supporting nationalism '' is not the same as being ashamed of the their nationality due to our imperialist history , which our current few generations had literally nothing to do with . 
  downvoted for stating factual information , never change r/europe . 
  just because when people talk about america and they mean the usa , does n't make it factually correct to say that america = usa , because it does not . 
  in the same way that just because people talk about europe and they mean the eu , does n't make it factually correct to say that europe = eu . 
  whilst the guy you 're talking you 're talking to is spouting shite elsewhere in this thread , he is indeed correct that the british abolished slavery long before the usa . 
  well there are 44 official countries in europe , whilst only 28 ( soon to be 27 obviously ) are in the eu . 
  that suggests that europe most certainly not is the eu . 
  my point was not that it 's ok because others have done it before , it was alluding to u/chinese _ bedbugs point that your judgement of the imperial usa is a little heavy handed considering all that preceded it . 
  in my opinion , the british empire is by far the most genocidal to have ever existed and that us imperialism in the 20th/21st centuries is relatively benign in comparison . 
  ( again , not saying for one second that it makes imperialism in any form acceptable ; it 's not . 
  just feel you 're judging too harshly compared to previous empires ) . 
   the us is a genodical empire . 
  can you name an empire that was n't genocidal though ? 
  ours was , the spanish was , the german was , the french was etc. 
  of all the large empires in human history , you could probably count on one hand which ones were n't genocidal in one form or another . 
  that 's light hearted banter most of the time , you see it during our sporting events during the rugby and cricket . 
  it 's all in good fun , nothing really malicious . 
   state education in the uk is shit . 
  [ well england is ranked 11th in the world education rankings as of a few months ago , which is higher than every single european country bar ireland ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38131731 ) . 
  we also have [ 5 universities in the world 's top 25 ranked schools ] ( https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats ) . 
  it 's been better in previous years , but hardly ` shit ' . 
   all uk citizens should be hoping for their country 's success . 
  judging by your flair , you 're not a uk citizen , so his comment does n't apply to your interests . 
  it might be the case that the big trading powers will get deals skewed in their favour , but it wo n't be the case that the uk will just get shafted and sit there and take it . 
  trade deals are supposed to be mutually beneficial , it is n't about winning and losing ( although i admit that the usa , china and the eu would likely get deals slightly more in their favour ) . 
  [ we were ranked number one in the world for the past few years in terms of ` soft ' ] ( http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/ranking/ ) ( i.e. 
  diplomatic , non-military power ) , and we 've only dropped down to number 2 in the world even after we 've left the eu . 
  that does n't count for nothing . 
  we 're not going to be some isolated ` little englander ' island left to rot , we 'll still have some ( if slightly diminished ) say on the world stage . 
  why are you talking in such vague terms ? 
  it would help if you define the threat . 
  protection from what , may i ask ? 
  we can protect ourselves from most threats as a sovereign nation state provided we co-operate with our neighbours and worldwide counterparts . 
  we do n't need political interference from brussels to be able to protect ourselves . 
  when including the uk , the 28 member states of the eu have vast differences in culture , economics , social standards and political affiliations . 
  trying to solve issues from brussels which affect ~ 500 million people will always mean that at a provincial/county level , certain places are overlooked . 
  i agree with you from an economic standpoint ; the single market/eea is absolutely a good thing and it sucks that we 're having to leave that . 
  but the political union is way too early to be tried . 
  when humanity has figured more shit out in the future , when there is more food to go around , much less crime/violence etc. 
  then there will be much less need for borders . 
  but we are a long way away from all 28 member states being so economically prosperous that it is possible to run a supra-national political organisation without horrendous teething problems or functional issues further down the line . 
  it had an effect on some , but not the majority . 
  the biggest reason is simple , giving up sovereignty to a supra-national organisation is not desirable . 
  people just like nation-state democracy for the time being ; in the future , humanity will likely move towards federal super states , but that time is not now . 
  even though immigration was a big topic , there are still tons of different reasons to want to vote to leave and tons of reason to want to remain . 
  stop painting such broad brush strokes about groups of people . 
  a ) we have n't yet left the european union , and wo n't until march 2019 at the earliest . 
  b ) it 's still more than possible to get a visa to european countries in future for a short time , or if you intend to move long-term , then you should be granted the privilege of moving to your future host country based on the merits of the skill-set you can bring to contribute to their society , not simply based on the country you were born in . 
  concern about immigration = / = xenophobia . 
   the public were uncritical and had a xenophobic bias ugh . 
  so tired of this crap being spewed . 
  yes , there are xenophobes on the vote leave side , but it 's a minority of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave . 
  there were myriad reasons to vote leave which were not bigoted , racist or xenophobic . 
  17.4 million people are not all entrenched in their hatred of johnny foreigner , they just reject the political ideology of a supra-national organisation . 
  what is so difficult to grasp about that ? 
  it 's not ; it is an extension of the original point i made in this thread [ about interpretation of religious texts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5pg3k6/pope_draws_parallels_between_populism_in_europe/dcr331q/?context=3 ) . 
  i have never referenced immigration once myself in this thread , so you have misunderstood my point . 
  but i 'm not talking about them in the west , i 'm talking about them in the middle east , where sharia law is often the law of the land ( or if it 's not , the [ vast majority of people in most of those countries wish it to be so ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/ ) ) . 
  in those instances , they absolutely do have power . 
  you 're talking about it from your/the european perspective , i 'm talking about the issue with it from a global perspective . 
  edit : just to clarify , i 'm an atheist and am not particularly fond of christians either , but they are much better world-wide than muslims when it comes to interpretation of holy texts . 
  a huge proportion of the people that voted leave ( and even a few who voted remain ) want immigration reform . 
  it was pretty much the number one topic debated in our country , so yes , many of my countryman share that opinion . 
  yes , they are pretty bad if you measure things compared to how secular europe is , but if you compare the religious interpretation of the bible in the usa ** in the 21st century ** to the religious interpretation of the quran in the middle east ** in the 21st century ** , it is a clear false equivalency . 
  there are religiously motivated acts of violence still happening in the usa , sure , but they are not at the same frequency or magnitude of those occurring in the middle east . 
  i 'm ideologically opposed to freedom of movement of people , not because i want to fully prevent people from coming here , but i believe that it discriminates against people from outside of the eu . 
  i believe everyone should be allowed to come here on their own merits with respect to the skill-sets they bring to contribute to our society , but not simply because they were born in one of the other 27 eu member states . 
  preferential treatment in that instance is wrong , and i would prefer an australian points-style system to be implemented as i feel it is fairer to prospective immigrants of countries from outside the eu . 
  we 're all aware that immigration is a net benefit to our society and that we want it to continue , but it 's not bigoted or xenophobic to principally reject the idea of the freedom of movement of people , especially considering that is how the countries on all of the other 4 ( inhabited ) continents still operate . 
  i realise that the window may be closing soon , but whilst we still have freedom of movement , is it not possible for you to think about maybe emigrating to one of the 27 member states ? 
  i realised that is a huge decision to take in life , to just up sticks and move to another country , but if i viewed myself as european first then british second and my values were more in-line with the rights endowed by brussels rather than westminster , it should be something you should give a bit of consideration to , no ? 
  i 'm sure that if people moved to the continent in time , part of an eu-uk deal will surely be to allow british expats across europe to retain their eu-citizenship . 
  well that 's fair enough , but just know that it was n't our intention to unleash such negative emotion , it 's just a side effect of wishing to put our country 's interests above that of the eu 's ( i realise that sounds selfish , but we 've always been the oddball of europe ) . 
   you ca n't just say `` well we think that the organization that you like so much and that you already closely identify with is rubbish and we want nothing to do with it '' and expect that europhillic people will say `` that 's ok , we can still be best buddies '' . 
  maybe not best buddies in this instance , but countries that have strong diplomatic ties in the 21st century should at least attempt to be grown-up and civil towards one another ; people across the world have strong political differences of opinion all the time , but we just have to take them in stride . 
  my bad for the assumption . 
  did i ever say that you had to shut up ? 
  you 're fully entitled to go on making the argument for your side , as is right in a 21st century democracy . 
  we do n't want teresa may to circumvent democracy , it is right that parliament should have a say on such a huge issue , but i feel that , regardless of personal views , an mp should vote on the issue in the way that the majority of their constituents voted as we live in a representative democracy . 
  and westminster must take its share of blame in the issues we face today , but most people have an ideological difference with a supranational organisation such as this which takes away our sovereignty , not a practical difference . 
  edit : mate , for future reference , the downvote button is not for comments that you simply disagree with , but for those comments that do n't in any way contribute to a discussion . 
  maybe keep that in mind next time you hover over it for a simple difference of opinion . 
  hence why i said from our perspective , not from the eu 's . 
  we 're just too ideologically different on many issues , which is why we 'd always be requesting further concessions . 
  we 've never been on board with ever-closer-union , we wanted nothing to do with the eurozone and there are many regulations imposed on us ( for example the common fisheries policy ) which our industries are completely against . 
  us leaving is a good thing for you in the long run , in the sense that you 'll now be able to politically integrate further without any resistance from the pesky brits . 
  we still love europe , just not the political project the eu has become . 
  i do n't see why people conflate our rejection of this as contempt for europeans as people . 
  and you can hope all you wish for something to derail it , but that just makes me think you 're the type of person who would hold a vote repeatedly until you get the outcome you wish for . 
  at some point ( even if there were admittedly a fair few lies thrown around on the vote leave side ( and to a lesser extent the remain side ) ) a democratic vote on which all people were aware of the terms of victory before the vote , will need to be respected . 
  i 'm sorry , but even the most ardent remainers in the brexit campaign realised that from our perspective , the eu needs some serious reforming ( hence the complete rejection of the deal david cameron got from brussels before he set the referendum date ) . 
  it 's not so much contempt as the rejection of the necessity of a supranational organisation which is too political for our liking , not the disliking of any one european country or europeans as people . 
  most religious texts are equally bat-shit crazy and dangerous , but the reason that muslims are scrutinised the most in this day and age is because they are usually from middle eastern societies which choose to interpret the quran too literally . 
  the reason that christians , for example , get less flak , is because in the western world , they are more often than not living in secular societies where they are essentially cherry-picking the best/most peaceful parts of the bible to follow because they realise that some of the more dangerous teachings actually clash with modern secular values . 
  islam has a problem with this still , and needs a reformation ( in the same way that christianity did following the dark ages ) before it can be welcomed fully into the western world in the 21st century . 
  i 'm ideologically opposed to a supranational organisation having a central government making decisions on certain policy issues for multiple countries that have huge cultural and political differences . 
  i wo n't deny that the eu has been very good in many instances ( workers rights have definitely improved , for example ) , but overall i feel that i 'm not able to hold brussels to account with my vote for an mep to the same level that i 'm able to hold westminster to account with my vote for my local mp . 
  i also think that the eu started out with good intentions in terms of economic policies , but now that it is a highly political organisation , i feel it 's just best if we go our separate ways .
