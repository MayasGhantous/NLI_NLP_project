  his legacy is clouded by the iraq war, 
  more redditors than people in real life . 
  i get the impression that cannabis can cure all the ills of the world and improve the economy overnight overlooking any negatives, 
  i dunno , the pro-cannabis group is also very annoying, 
  it may be growing but for whom ? 
  or who is reaping the most benefit . 
  it 's not the working class , the poor , the sick , the asylum seekers , the unemployed after all . 
  this growth should be used to ease austerity and maintain a safety net for all but i guess that 's too leftist for our politicians who seem to do very well out of being corporate shills, 
  the other third must be from the uk, 
  i wonder how it was worked out . 
  i am not for a moment surprised by the result though, 
  i would be hesitant to call austerity indiscriminate - the richest in society and those capable of influencing governments have done just fine . 
  i can only speak for the uk but imo the tories have used the economy as a smokescreen for ideological cuts, 
  i can only speak for myself and my acquaintances but it was the media blowing it out of proportion . 
  you have to remember both events happened in silly season, 
  asda in general and lidl for cold meats, 
  except the best and brightest are only there because they exploit others . 
  whether overtly by having servants etc or indirectly by infrastructure and other mundane things . 
  did n't the republicans fail to mention that it 's businesses trying to earn even more profit that gives the mexicans a reason to come, 
   it would be a god send if it was true . 
  it would pretty much destroy any reason to get involved although if the rhetoric is to believed they should go after the rebels who used it . 
  ca n't see it happening though, 
  yup . 
  we 're sabre rattling for much the same reason as spain : to distract from woes at home, 
  per 1,000 people is the important part . 
  because america has a large population it 'll have a lower rate per 1000 people than sweden who have a small population, 
  that does n't matter to the anti eu lot here . 
  `` europe = bad '' except for spanish weather , polish labour and cheap fags/booze it 's really frustrating, 
  certainly so . 
  another one is they 'll simply redefine unemployment to reduce the figures, 
  total annihilation then, 
  i suspect it 's also being overblown by british media for much the same reason, 
  sounds familiar . 
  is your press also anti eu as a matter of course ? 
  ** birmingham ** * heavy metal * cadbury 's * spaghetti junction * birth of the ( association ) football league, 
  it does n't do that much but , like the article , it 's a symbolic gesture . 
  bankers arguably caused this crash yet are still living the life of riley whilst we all pay for it personally i am in favour of a maximum ratio ( say 25:1 ) of the highest earner to the lowest in an organisation ( pro-rata for part time employees ) . so if the lowest person is paid # 10,000 pa the highest can earn no more than # 250,000 pa, 
   with those numbers in mind , statistically , is better to just not apply the maths does n't lie but often you still have to apply either through desperation or to keep any unemployment benefits . 
  i applied for a number of jobs knowing i would never get it in a month of sundays, 
  all they have to do is ask at sign-up : * do you want to block any of the following groups of sites ? 
  * it should be up to the user to change this state of affairs and if we 're talking about contracts i think isps should have to pay a pro-rata fee if their service goes down more than ( a cumulative ) 5 % of time in any rolling 4 week period, 
  ** edit : changed 2c to further distinguish it from 2a ** it 's pretty sad but it 's pretty much true . 
  a lot of people will just not be lucky enough . 
  as a rough guess a process could be as follows . 
  a human need not see the application until step 7 . corrections welcome  1 . 
  the initial application is almost certainly going to be online 2 . 
  i suspect there will be a character/personality test of some sort which will weed out a number of applicants -- the sort where you have * if it 's a busy day and you 're about to go on a break when someone asks for help , what do you do ? 
  take your break * * b. 
  help the customer * * c. find a colleague and get them to help the customer * 3 . 
  keyword filtering in any section in almost any free text box . 
  spelling and grammar errors 5 . 
  possible filtering based on previous employment , qualifications etc ( i 'm not sure if the system would know if a certain box was n't filled in ) 6 . 
  leaving any section blank or tricks on the form ( eg a fake submit form button but with a small notice saying do n't press this one ) 7 . 
  filtering by area , if an applicant 's postcode ( or the italian equivalent ) is too far away it can be discarded 8 . 
  some sort of mass open day which is mandatory to attend 9 . 
  pre-employment training 10 . 
  interview day 11 . 
  * second * interview 12 . 
  hired, 
  i would rather have a monarch than an elected head of state who 'd be vulnerable to political pressures and electioneering . 
  a monarch provides continuity and seems to be useful in foreign affairs as a representative of the country rather than the party . 
  can anyone say that joe bloggs has the chance to become a high level politician ? 
  thought not . 
  cameron is the epitome of the tory old boys club and because of a link between party and candidate joe bloggs wo n't become president of course we do n't need a head of state at all , the pm could fill it but would you really want cameron as head of state ? 
  few earning under # 30k would i would be interested in how germany 's system works in reality, 
  / r/polandball, 
  as a brit we only tend to compare with the usa which makes it seem expensive . 
  no mention is made of any other country except when it 's done explicitly . 
  i guess it 's human nature to be jealous of those better off, 
  i disagree if only because i think the country would be better if the main parties were n't all but indistinguishable . 
  the left needs the right to balance it and vice versa . 
  i dislike tory policy but labour are no different . 
  i suspect the roles are reversed for yourself ** tl ; dr balance is good imo **, 
  so it 's still below april 's forecast of 1 % . 
  bet that is forgotten by the chancellor who must have hoped we 'd forgotten . 
  oh silly me , it 's * labour 's * fault growth was cut in april / s, 
  there are a number of us who are in favour of the eu and the echr - you just do n't get to hear our voices . 
  i 'd rather take brussels ' protection than westminster 's , especially since we have no political left thanks to fptp and labour moving right, 
  cameron is full of shit . 
  always has been, 
  very badly except the bbc and guardian ( both centre-left ) . 
  that 's not to say there is a paucity of news but it 's mostly anti-europe and how the continent meddles in our affairs - never for the better edit : for example i first found about the floods in germany by reading * deutsche welle *, 
   we have n't been bale to make any progress over the years ... intentional or just a funny typo, 
  bribery if the rumours are to believed, 
  time to cart all that stuff over the bridge, 
  beating ireland , germany and france, 
  hashtag winner, 
  did n't qualify ? 
  boo , giving france a vote, 
  denmark have got this sewn up now but it 's certainly been closer than usual, 
  graham is really taking the piss out of this comms link, 
  thank you ireland , kinda feel bad not giving you anything now !, 
  lena is still fit i see . 
  the sky looks very light in tallinn for what must be about 1am in the morning, 
  thank you malta . 
  now you 'd better not give ireland anything . 
  beating the french would be a nice bonus too, 
  the guy in the green room keeps saying hashtag at the end of every other sentence whereby normal people would just say the sentence . 
  we 're taking the piss lol, 
  muchas gracias espanol ( and apologies if i butchered your language ),
