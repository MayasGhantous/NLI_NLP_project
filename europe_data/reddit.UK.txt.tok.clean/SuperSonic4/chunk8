  winter time . 
  i 'd much rather have light mornings than evenings, 
  i 'm from the midlands  . 
  whether that is north or south to you is a matter of endless discussions in / r/britishproblems, 
  it does but i find anything above 18 to be too hot so the highs of 25/30 in kent are better avoided, 
  yep . 
  cool and wet is my idea of a nice summer . 
  granted england is too warm in the summer so ireland may be the same, 
  republic of ireland . 
  english speaking , great weather and plenty of good tea to be had . 
  instant messaging would be great . 
  xmpp is a nice protocol but the people i speak to refuse to not use facebook leaving me with the decision to talk to nobody or use the messenger, 
  [ black sabbath ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yr5xhcieg ) by black sabbath . 
  the uk is disappointing me i must admit . 
  9/12 is kinda embarrassing . 
  i suck at reading comprehension, 
  i can only speak for the uk but what you describe is what we 'd call francophilic . 
  francophone is someone who speaks french, 
  there 's a reason it 's known as the * torygraph *, 
  cameron is just trying to look tough for may 's election . 
  talk about this has been ongoing for months with nothing happening, 
  ireland : potatoes otherwise it 's the wet because water is, 
  is the red scare cool again now ? 
  or is it just being sent out again lest the people realise there are alternatives to the current model ? 
  had the article suggested museums to commemorate those victims of authoritarian governments of both left and right i 'd be more sympathetic . 
  why not have a museum for the victims of capitalism ? 
  hyperbole i know but it 's still responsible for deaths ( even if the dwp refuses to admit some of the latest victims ), 
  after being sued by grown up children for posting pictures online . 
  oh yes it 's also only * could * . 
  but then i swear the torygraph is stepping up it 's campaign to paint europe in a negative light . 
  as it happens i 'd have no problem with such a law . 
  a right to privacy is universal and does not come with an age limit . 
  baby pictures are only there for parents to brag anyway - it 's hardly in the child 's interests, 
  have sweden changed their name to captain obvious ? 
  it 's clear to anyone who wishes to see it, 
  as in conspiracy theories ? 
  probably the queen having something to do with princess diana 's death, 
  until it reaches an equilibrium on both sides of the boundary . 
  such is diffusion . 
  it 's the same physical principle as why a fart stops smelling after a while, 
  costs money , wo n't happen . 
  no , it 's eurosceptic year, 
  but all poles are in the uk . 
  the papers surely would n't mislead would they ? 
  it really is . 
  just give it a quick read this morning, 
  i 'm saying that there are more right wing outlets than left and just because we have [ a fair number of both does n't make our media balanced ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_to_moderation ) additionally , those outlets which are popular have a greater control over the information that is broadcast . 
  the cost of a free press is , ironically , censorship - but by newspaper editors rather the government . 
  the effect has lessened considerably with the internet, 
  the sun is still pretty right wing . 
  the metro is basically daily mail lite . 
  the top 10 in 2014 are below , bold are right wing and italic left wing . 
  ones i 'm not sure of are not formatted . 
  this is all imo of course ** daily mail ** * daily mirror * ** daily telegraph ** * the guardian * ** metro ** ** the sun ** the independent daily express ** london evening standard ** ** the times ** daily record the scotsman edit : source http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/nrs-daily-mail-most-popular-uk-newspaper-print-and-online-23m-readers-month-0, 
  in the same way 10 men are sitting on one end of a see saw and 3 men of equal mass are sitting on the other is balanced, 
  it 's becoming more and more hateful . 
  less is more, 
  i never said it was probable , just possible . 
  i do n't believe it 'll happen, 
  thank you for that well thought out rebuttal, 
  oh it 's possible alright . 
  rock up in the dead of night with some troops , grab him and fly him in a secret plane to the usa and once he 's there they can do what they like . 
  once the story breaks what can people do ? 
  might makes right in this world, 
  never said i was . 
  it was a light hearted question, 
  now , who 's not heard of any of their country 's tracks lol ? 
  me for one, 
  princess diana 2 . 
  house prices, 
  they make it sound like the whole damn organisation is corrupt, 
  jordan were willing to sign a non torture treaty long before they did but may wanted to sully the hra so denied it, 
  are n't we merely allowing entry rather than inviting him over ? 
  also if he calls us communist that means we can seize his land for the people / s edit : forgot my / s tag as i thought i was in / r/uk, 
  yes . 
  even with the varied nomenclature of the uk, 
  not much . 
  it 's the right 's attempt to scaremonger, 
  there 's still a decent amount of slack in the economy but the political will is n't there to do so, 
  it 's long been accepted but the right are going all out to further discredit the left, 
  that 's the poisonous influence religion can have, 
  it 's very dark for a few minutes before 1400, 
  i 'd be interested to know how many proponents of this would be somehow ineligible for conscription themselves edit : seems the answer is low and i learnt something new . 
  here in the uk the voices which appear to call loudest for national service would be ineligible, 
  alas poor yorick , i knew him and used him to buy a pint, 
  the queen is awesome . 
  speaks with gravitas and dignity david cameron however is a smug prick who always blames the opposition, 
  the availability of tea . 
  you can get it everywhere and some hotels put kettles in the rooms so you can make your own tea, 
  it 's probably true , the media does n't need any help, 
  i know a number of the coastal states but the ones in the middle are largely a mystery . 
  on mobile so ca n't really fill it in at the moment, 
  it also fits the definition of a parasite, 
  unlike millennia of fighting over which god is the right one . 
  silly me , they were fought for * other * reasons were n't they, 
  they can try but it wo n't happen . 
  would n't surprise me if this was just a sop to the * think of the children * crowd . 
  social media are n't exactly going to make it hard to register , just the tick box saying you 're over 16 . 
  which ties into the main aim of politics : to get , and then keep , yourself in power at almost any cost,
