  labour , the liberal democrats , the snp , and the greens are all also pro-eu . 
  that leaves ukip , who are very much marmite , and the minority of tory euroscpetics against basically every other significant political party in the uk . 
  the media and pro-eu parties will scaremonger to no end . 
  we saw how they 'll act during the scottish independence referendum . 
  how , with every other party and the majority of the media up against them , will ukip and a couple dozen tory mps convince a majority of people to leave ? 
  they ca n't . 
  soft power , woo !, 
  he 's ukip 's best asset , and there 's a referendum campaign coming up , of course ukip want him to remain as leader . 
  does n't stop the fact that farage did offer his resignation as promised . 
  just to point out before the usual anti-farage circle jerk , he followed through on his promise to resign and did so . 
  the ukip nec then rejected his resignation , despite farage clearly wanting some time away . 
  you could tell from his reaction and face after losing the thanet south election that he was relieved to be able to take some time out with his family . 
  he did n't ` stand and get re-elected ' , he resigned and then the party refused to accept the resignation . 
  as someone who would vote out , i can say with near certainty that we 'd vote to stay in . 
  cameron will get a few minor concessions which he 'll then pretend amounts to a massive re-negotiation to the electorate who 'll then vote to stay in . 
  once the media starts scaremongering , and all the major parties except for ukip club together to campaign for an in vote it 'll be extremely unlikely that the no vote succeeds . 
  he 's resigned , but basically said that he 'll stand in the leadership election to be held in september after having a nice holiday . 
  4 million votes and 1 mp . 
  the snp got 1.5 million votes and 56 mps . 
  fptp is the worst . 
  i agree with their policies and the horrendous treatment they receive by the media and their opponents made it all the more satisfying, 
  you 're right , he was n't a banker . 
  they wo n't send people back , just stop anyone else from entering unless they had a visa . 
  what are these mystical jobs that are at risk from eu withdrawal ? 
  even the guy who wrote that report about the 3 million jobs being st risk admits it was a load of tripe . 
  is trade going to stop just because we are n't in a political union with someone ? 
  of course it is n't . 
  do explain . 
  nobody wants a party who 's goal is to break up the kingdom to be in government . 
  if scotland insist o voting for a party who make outrageous demands like scrapping trident then i 'm glad miliband has ruled out a deal with them . 
  sturgeon has said that she 'd never prop up a tory government . 
  that means the snp would have to vote for miliband 's budgets and queens speeches anyway or risk another election and the tories getting into government . 
  i think that 's what miliband is relying on , he can have a minority government with snp support based not on a deal , but on the snp trying to keep the tories out . 
  and this is why there would be a free trade deal between the uk and the eu . 
  that 's the point ... 
  i 'd just like to take this moment to point out that farage was the first party leader to say that we owed a duty of care to libyan refugess given our actions , and that he was wholly in favour of offering asylum to a number of them . 
  * free prescriptions * free tuition fees , which extend to other eu citizens but not the english * more money spent per head than any other nation of the uk yeah , life must be so tough for you poor scots . 
  oh look , a scot with a chip on his shoulder . 
  who 'd have thought it ? 
  handsome as fuck . 
  nah , the greens genuinely are irrelevant . 
  they 'll be lucky to keep their one mp . 
  absolutely disgusting behaviour . 
  i do n't care what your opinion of farage is , you do n't swarm around him and his young children while he 's out enjoying a quiet meal and act like animals jumping on his bonnet etc. 
  i 'd take someone fiddling their expenses or making a stupid comment over the paedophiles/paedophile enablers and war criminals in the other parties . 
  the argument that ukip somehow has more bad eggs , or that theirs people are worse than the other parties , is ridiculous . 
  no , we 're just confident in our ability to negotiate a simple free trade deal . 
  if mexico and switzerland can do it then the uk certainly can . 
  ukip do n't want to stay in the eea . 
  i 'd much rather have this than free movement within the eu . 
  these are all highly developed nations with very similar culture , and the same language . 
  i would n't count on it . 
  this , the tories are ** hugely ** divided on europe as well . 
  maybe he 's going to advocate the position gordon brown did the other day and tell us that true british nationalism is wanting your country to become a region of a european super-state , and that if you disagree you 're in favour of the uk becoming north korea . 
  still waiting on you justfying this . 
  how she can think this will help the leave cause i 've no idea . 
  yeah it 's really not having the effect the remain camp thought it would . 
  the latest eu poll has leave ahead by 3 points despite cameron just sending out his propaganda leaflet to every household in the country . 
  i do n't think you understand how polling works . 
  oh look , someone incapable of drawing the distinction between ` europe ' and the eu . 
  maybe you should be banned on the grounds of sheer idiocy ? 
  i do n't think the uk needs economic advice from the rest of europe . 
  being ` european ' is not reliant on being a member of the eu . 
  not wanting to be in a political union with the rest of europe does not equate to ignoring it . 
  this has still got another reading to go before it 's passed and becomes law . 
  labour and the snp abstained and are putting forth amendments that they demand they get else they 'll vote against it at the next reading . 
  if they did then there 's a chance the opposition benches could get enough tory rebels to reject the bill . 
  if not it 's down to the lords to reject it . 
  once the campaigns get going those numbers would shift . 
  remain was far and away ahead before the brexit campaign 's started , now leave is ahead by up to 9 points in some polls . 
  harvard lawyer ca n't find europe on a map . 
  got it . 
  obvious bollocks , nowhere else in the world is free movement a requirement for free trade . 
   german chancellor angela merkel has blamed european nations for `` unilaterally '' shutting the balkan route for migrants . 
  made me laugh , considering merkel 's decision to unilaterally invite the whole of africa to europe . 
  exactly . 
  he can say it all he wants , he 's wrong . 
  agreed . 
  we do have a constitution . 
  erm cameron is quite obviously in favour of staying in the eu . 
  this is all just theatrics to make people believe his pathetic renegotiation is somehow substantial . 
  at the cost of social cohesion . 
  it might be , but pretending a remain vote will result in anything other than that is delusional . 
  how dare someone have opposing views to my own !, 
  he 's not wrong , every single thing the remain side comes out with is blatant scaremongering . 
  it 's not even subtle . 
  you might not , but plenty of your countrymen do . 
  it 's deliberate , the remain side are attempting to paint leaving as turning our backs on the continent and becoming isolated , when in fact it 's merely a rejection of the political institutions and the uk would still co-operate , trade , and be friendly with europe if it did leave . 
  if you take a look at the ` britain stronger in europe ' campaign 's website you 'll be hard pressed to find the term ` european union ' used on there ; when last i looked there was just the word ` europe ' plastered everywhere . 
  very good summation . 
  rand paul , but obviously that 's not going to happen . 
  where did i use the word ugly ? 
  i did n't even post in the other thread you simpleton . 
  what 's your point ? 
  pointing out how bitter op is being making this thread because he got his feelings hurt by the one about eastern european architecture does n't mean i condone anti-homeless people practices . 
  why are you so bitter ? 
  it 's not going to happen , even if some on this sub are obsessed with the idea of it . 
  the countries of europe are too different with competing interests , and you 'll never get the people of them to willingly surrender more and more sovereignty to a european superstate ; the eu could n't even get the constitutional treaty passed . 
  already you see anti-eu sentiment rising across the continent , you ca n't carry on taking power from people against the will of significant portions of the population .
