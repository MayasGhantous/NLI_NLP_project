  oh , that 's just my leg falling off . 
   putin out medvedev in medvedev out putin in in out in out shake it all about you do the autocraty-kokie and you turn around . 
  and that 's what it 's all about !, 
  that 's a really catchy song even if i do n't know if the video is sarcastic or serious :p, 
   while they enjoy free health care and other social benefits . 
  ` free ' . 
  it 's not free , we do n't have insane levels of tax for no reason . 
  it 's only free to those who do n't pay into the system . 
  i dont get it :(, 
  or pac-man with lockjaw .

  to be honest i 'd prefer james cameron to david . 
  james cameron would speed up our fossil fuel use , meaning that the uk will be underwater from global warming faster . 
  we all have to see the bottom of the ocean . 
  also blue skin is mandatory . 
  when your ideology is more important than keeping your citizens fed , you have a bit of a problem . 
  got ta be pragmatic . 
  left - right liberal - conservative nationalist - internationalist atheistic - theocratic luddite - transhumanist cake - pie cats - dogs, 
  what does language have to do with this ? 
  i 'm talking about everything . 
  it is . 
  cameron is a tool and anyone who thinks he is actually standing up for us brits from the ` big bad scary eu ) is fooling themselves . 
  he is very much pro eu , despite what he says . 
  he ca n't realistically change anything and is trying to appease euroskeptics and it 's not working . 
  take that faroese !, 
  who needs to use knives and boats when you can just explode them/s, 
  lol what . 
  turkey is n't exactly hyper wealthy . 
  money has to be poured into jordan to sustain what they have . 
  so the eu requires authoritarian intervention because the eu states wo n't agree with each other ? 
   but you wo n't find countries ceding power to the eu . 
  if votes from everywhere count equally the german or french voter bloc is also massively more powerful than for example the czech one . 
  honestly it does n't even matter anyway . 
  it 's not like the meps make the laws . 
  they only vote on them . 
  if it was more of a parliament structure where elected officials made and changed the laws , i 'd more likely want to stay in the eu . 
  the parliament is almost like a puppet show , masquerading as a democratic system . 
  whereas in reality the commission which is n't elected by the people makes the laws . 
  am i the only one who prefers little pockets of different cultures co-existing rather than this bland monogamous blend with no personality ? 
  i want countries to retain their ` nativeness ' . 
  i do n't object to immigration assuming it 's sensible , but i 'd rather the world be diverse and co-operative rather than a big mush of everything . 
  gib alaska to canada , it hurts to look at a political map otherwise :( then it will be cold , dark and full of apologising alcoholics . 
  greenland needs to build a wall to stop those damn americans comin ' over here and stealing our ... uhh ... seals ? 
  like iberia ? 
  2016 english : hey guys , wan na go swimming ?!, 
  i do n't know what the average salary is in germany , but yeah , that 's a crap load of money . 
  it 's relative . 
  compare the uk to other countries in the world . 
  we 're one of the most densely populated . 
  and just because we can fit more people in , does n't mean we should . 
  honestly i have no idea . 
  stealing our bloody beach towels . 
  bloody ^ germans ^ get ^ your ^ own ^ bloody ^ towels ^ you ^ towel ^ stealing ^ towel ^ thiefs ^ eu ^ dictators ^ arrrghghghgh, 
  full of people who do n't know how to use a toilet . 
  online : whatever pops up on reddit , also nrk . 
  offline : sky news , nhk for asia affairs and whatever papers people have left on the train . 
  we all want europe to flourish . 
  the eu is preventing that . 
  i 've met 30 year olds who did n't even know what the leaders of the main 2 parties were . 
  honestly if they 're going to be that ignorant on the topic what 's the point of hearing their opinions ? 
  what i would like to see if we leave is some of the other euroskeptic countries leaving too , with the rest devoted to the eu project go forward to federalise . 
  well maybe outside of london . 
  the south east where i live is one giant grey clusterfudge . 
  thanks man . 
  australia , new zealand , canada or if i had to stay in europe norway , denmark or portugal . 
  i suspect lots of brits would pick the first three . 
  i hope our population stagnates or slowly decreases . 
  i think we 've hit our peak in england . 
  i do n't want to see it become just a giant concrete jungle . 
  do n't worry norway , they 're just jelly of your fjords , 
  thank you , 
  he upset the pug :(, 
  yeah , i plataeued last christmas , for about 4 months . 
  overeating at xmas knocked me out of my routine and i gained a kg back , but still on track now  obviously the more weight you have the faster it comes off . 
  cheers . 
  it helps when you stop drinking 4 cans of coke and eating 2 packs of crisps and half a pack of hob nobs a day . 
  that 's literally a good 1500-2000 calories in itself . 
  i was biiig . 
  i 'm still a bit chubby now , but i 'm about 5kg off of my optimal bmi/weight goal . 
  * dreams of ukausnz union *, 
  [ yes , lets .

  no , you and / u/executivemonkey have similar names . 
  [ y-yeah it 's okay , d-don ' t worry ; ~ ; . 
  ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4075/4915797196_9e0ee933dd_b.jpg ), 
  suburban londoner ( sorta kent but not really ) here . 
  it 's not super-americanised , but we 've adopted quite a few ` americanisations ' and brands . 
  subways , quiznos , drive-thrus , people driving 4x4s even though you live in the middle of a very compact city , american media , american ` malls ' ( though it 's not an uncommon thing on the continent either ) are a few things i can think of . 
  i do think the uk is more similar to the other anglophone nations like canada or australia and new zealand moreso than america . 
  very similar name to / u/thenaughtymonkey x-files music time ? 
  can you not :( lost 45kg over the last 3 years , can i be more european now ? 
  i 'll stop buying starbucks , i swear . 
  we 're gun build a wahl !, 
  actually , in 3016 i will be advocating for pluto-venusian independence from the ever undemocratic galactic union . 
  yeah but just look at our shiny white hats !, 
  see : national bolshevism . 
  nationalism can pretty much be attached at any political philosophy aside from anarchism i 'd imagine . 
  even then anarchism is just without state , the identity of a peoples is still there . 
  hehe , i 'll consider it but it looks really intimidating :d . 
  ah i 've considered it but i dont know how to play .
