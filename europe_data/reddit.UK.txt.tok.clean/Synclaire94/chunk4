  thanks for claiming muslims are their own ethnic group again . 
  calling people racist wo n't make their opinions change . 
  throw waffles at them . 
  `` oh she 's removing the flag on palestine ? 
  it 's refreshing to see a muslim who actually - oh . 
   .  '' hey at least she left our flag alone . 
  as someone who voted for ukip in the eu elections , they 'll be a minor party if we leave . 
  it 'll just go back to tory/lab . 
  it 's been going on for over a thousand years now . 
  if you saw the crowds many of them were foreigners . 
  most brits do n't give a shit what that commoner pumps out . 
  plus people caring about them does n't have anything to do with their lack of power . 
   we 're not looking forward to the prospect of beng governed by kippers and eurosceptic tories , i can assure you . 
  you wo n't be ? 
  which ca n't do anything realistically . 
  [ laughs in european ], 
  why is brussels 's muslim population so high compared to other european capitals ? 
  also ... why do they seem to ` ghettoise ' themselves ? 
  either way , we 've had a lot of time to prepare for all this . 
  trouble has been brewing for a while . 
  does your beard have a moustache also ? 
  but nah , you 'll be fine . 
  yeah reminded me of that quote . 
  can blair please just fuck off already ? 
  i can smell your ego and terrorism breeding from here . 
  the audacity of the man . 
  if that 's true , that is literally chamberlain level of appeasement . 
  well we need to start buying oil elsewhere first . 
  norway , canada and russia ( yes even russia ) and start sanctioning saudi arabia . 
  so is being in a plane crash . 
  still worried a bit about flying though . 
  what did it say ? 
  you mean little netherlands ? 
  they happily fund wahabbi mosques on our continent though . 
  ca n't wait for the oil to run out so the wealthy medieval state just crumbles . 
  they just end up radicallising more people in prison . 
  you 'll eat those waffles and you 'll enjoy them !, 
  yeah with raisins and or currents  i just put butter on mine .

  https://millgreenmuseum.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/hot-cross-bun.jpg hot cross buns !!!, 
  yummy spiced bun we eat here in the anglosphere . 
  usually around easter . 
  i have some downstairs and it looks like an english flag , 
  ` do n't let your memes be dreams laddie ' there ? 
  :( i do n't hate the scots ... much !, 
  well that was br\u00fctal . 
  do i ? 
  i remember pratts bottom because i used to drive past it alot when i was younger :p stuck in my brain lol, 
  you forgot [ pratts bottom ( even if it is a village ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pratt%27s_bottom ), 
  norway , denmark , finland , beesti , uk , iceland , faroese and swiss flags are best . 
  most tricolours suck imo . 
  god save the flag . 
  deutschland kannot into nordics ? 
  but vi kan into poland !, 
  hue hue hue . 
  beesti has an awesome flag . 
  it 's a tricolor but it 's got unique colours . 
  is that the ` splattered in blood , let me take off my belt ' one ? 
  ours is the opposite really . 
  like some hot cross bun malarkey, 
  we 're making plans for nigel ? 
  is / u/executivemonkey human or a / r/shitamericanssay bot ? 
  find out next week !, 
  i like the swiss flag . 
   i actually think the usa flag is too cluttered and obnoxious ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  sexiest nordic flag, 
  scotland should join in with a tartan pattern, 
  polish is more common in wales than welsh . 
  what 's void diagonal ? 
  and what does more castel mean ? 
  i think the entire french riviera was nice . 
  to be fair though i ca n't really think of some underrated places in france . 
  same goes for the uk . 
  everyone thinks the uk is just london . 
  london and paris both suck imo . 
  yay !, 
  why did you move to finland ? 
  i do n't mind . 
  as long as you guys rebuild doggerland too . 
  you guys can replace sweden in eurovision this year . 
  you 're probably more european / s, 
  soros as in george soros ? 
  people keep talking about him . 
  how does he relate to all this ? 
   there are however 55 areas of sweden indentified as especially problematic . 
   problematic . 
  oh i hate this word for what it covers up . 
  america still has very strict immigration laws . 
  can i have a virgin sacrifice ? 
  america is an immigrant nation . 
  germany , sweden and norway are not . 
  i should become self employed !, 
  it probably is outdated , but i 've never seen coke sell for more than # 3 at non-events . 
   just tourist prices ? 
  yeah you got ripped off :( sorry xd many fancy cocktail bars here cost an arm and a leg too .
