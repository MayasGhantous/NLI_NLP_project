  i 've seen videos of migrants in schools beating up finns : /, 
  i did n't answer your second post because you accused me of something i did n't say . 
  but to answer it anyway , i have no fucking idea , i 'm not polish . 
   lol you really think talking about abortion can have the same effect on you/your career in poland as opposing mass/muslim immigration in western europe ? 
  tell me where i said that . 
  i said that being openly in support about lgbt right could get you persecuted . 
  you guys constitutionally banned same-sex marriages after all . 
   currently there 's decades long queues for housing in cities in sweden and i thought it was bad in the uk o.o does finland have such a socialised system as the rest of the nordics ? 
  [ i am sorry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqkzestq0wo ), 
  going to norway because you get taxed too much seems kinda illogical . 
  is n't norway just or even more expensive ? 
  it wo n't stop raining . 
  give us california . 
  or halvsies on texas . 
  you 're staying on uncle marx 's wild ride . 
  or the thrilling conclusion to the trilogy ` mein kampfy chair '' . 
  with real pop up and feely pages . 
  apparently it 's a semi incoherent rant about jews and stuff . 
  try talking openly about abortions or lgbt rights and see how far that 'll get you . 
  1939-45 thats why / s, 
  do you think you or i could xpost this to / r/videos ? 
  might be cool to get more non-european opinions , 
  something something non-country . 
  is it 21 year old or 21 , yo !, 
  we 'll never know . 
  nz too i suppose . 
  similar to the uk but not too similar . 
  can canada , aus and nz come too ? 
  whats summer ? 
  can it ? 
  o.o i thought morocco was one of the more ` liberal ' islamic nations . 
  finnish and estonian people just divide like cells one night in the middle of winter in a forest somewhere . 
  seeking asylum from what exactly though ? 
  have you heard him speak recently ? 
  he is far less extreme than he used to be . 
  til morocco is a warzone, 
  ... i thought russia 's economy was in shambles due to the oil prices and sanctions ? 
  so i decided to google [ fittja out of interest ... ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/45ed0dcfd869a7d4e2fa985b65c6ae89.png ), 
  now that 's what i call ` progressive ' !, 
  unrelated but you have the most polish looking name i 've ever seen . 
  get with the british lexicon , plonker  . 
  moreso than turkey is imo . 
  but it 's not really that european in the western european or southern european sense . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ ^ turkey ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ you, 
  but portugal has this thing called sunlight . 
  it 's not that but the fact that the only argument people can seem to make against these parties is that `` they 've nazis '', 
  sure why not \u2661 < 3 hug, 
   nazi-era measure topkek . 
  they 'll get their cash back when they go home . 
  america worst child . 
  not like aus , nz and canada . 
  south africa ? 
  seems an odd connection . 
  i might be wrong , but i was under the assumption from what i 've seen that quebec french and french french hate each other xd, 
  rationing ? 
   lol topkek what are the circus oh georgia your butt language is funny . 
  \u00de\u00f8p\u0137\u0259\u0137, 
  \u016e w\u00f8\u00fe m8, 
  p\u0151\u0142\u012b \u00a7 h \u012f\u015b w\u0259\u0131\u0155\u0111 . 
  why are you suspiciously calm ? 
  i was n't talking specifically about the eu . 
  what does that have to do with living on an island ? 
  whats so special about june 15 2025 ? 
  i 'll be disappointed if any uk euroskeptics are being fooled by cameron into thinking he is anything but pro-eu . 
  they have a point though , i agree to either fully committing or leaving . 
  i ca n't stand this in out in out shake it all about ` pick n ' mix ' relationship we have with the eu . 
  it annoys us and it 's clearly annoying to the eu . 
  shh , do n't tell anyone bulgaria or you 'll be a part of our new empire , 
  sweden needs to chill out . 
  i think it is honorable taking in genuine refugees , but it seems ideology is is overtaking practicality and it will only cause more issues not only socially but economically unless they step back and assess the situation they are putting themselves in . 
  well i honestly do think the idea of an island mentality is a real thing . 
  growing up on an island compared to a continental country or landlocked country i think subconsciously forms quite a lot of your opinions . 
  was n't there a knife attack in sweden at a school last year as well ? 
  not again : /, 
  buildable . 
  all i have to say is that greece is having to deal with problems one after the other : / . 
  what a crappy situation they are in . 
  no wonder they are still in the middle ages / s, 
  i love him . 
  apparently i live in a feminising region . 
  does that mean it 's getting more females over time or something ? 
  these terms are really stupid . 
  i 'm yet to find a left leaning party with strict immigration controls and is n't afraid to be patriotic ... 
  well , clearly . 
  interesting . 
  i do n't think it 'll turn out quite like that though . 
  the establishment are still very pro-islam . 
  redistribution of labour betwixt eu member states and redistribution of state wealth through eu contributions and funding is pretty left wing to someone like my dad . 
   illegal immigrant ? 
  enjoy your life in a refugee center in botswana , until you tell us what 's your country of origin . 
  aus does that with illegals on nauru . 
  issue is there is some human rights convention that stops us doing that . 
  but australia does it - and to be honest when we have fucking saudi arabia on that council you know it 's a bit of a joke . 
  pretty morbid but i guess he makes his point . 
  well you clearly have a nuanced view on this . 
  i just hope more people can think the way you and i do . 
  i remember reading about how you guys use an analogy about lack of roads to describe lack of funding/corruption etc. 
  you 've got egypt . 
  that 's got like ... 80 million people in it ? 
  do n't you guys have some road meme about romanian economics ?
