i 'm one of them . 
  the recent issues have also made some lgbt people join supposed far right parties . 
  they call it an agenda . 
  most people call it national ebb and flow of peoples and cultures , business and industry . 
  why are they so surprised ? 
  they 're not even anarchists . 
  90 % of them are just dumb students who think some shops opening is somehow destroying our culture ( even though most of these guys dont live in the places where gentrification is happening ), 
  til that right wing populists are now far right . 
  well if you get a bunch of veneers and crowns and bleachings done then yes , they 're fake . 
  :3 = but you are walruses . 
  at least they look real unlike the american piano teeth . 
  i 'm not talking about terrorists . 
  find me an entire mosque community that does n't dislike lgbt people or giving women equal rights . 
  `` love for all hatred for none '' haha . . ha ... yeah no . 
  because most women do n't go around claiming random men raped them . 
  heck it could be 90 % and people will still moan . 
  when in doubt , hate the government , not it 's people . 
  that 's how i tend to do things . 
  yeah but taxis :(, 
  til irish people are made out of rubber, 
   i always love it when british people call americans fat with a haughty sense of superiority it 's more of a stereotype more than anything . 
  though you do see stay-puft americans in those motorised wheelchairs which is pathetic lol . 
   and in my personal experience anyway , having lived in both , britain is far fatter than the united states , though my experience is limited to merseyside and the surrounding area . 
  the more northern you go the fatter people get . 
  all your malnourished immigrants seems to work in your favour when it comes to obesity ratings . 
  if you looked like that you 'd be very very ill . 
  something something potato-based insult, 
  always believe in your soulll you have the power to know you indestructible always beleiiive iiin, 
  i think ireland needs some more colonisation . 
  middle class students who vote what their parents told em . 
  you 're just jelly . 
  do n't listen to him beesti . 
  you can understand hsinnif ? 
  oh goodness i misread your comment i first replied to , sorry !, 
  ... social democrats are not ** far ** left . 
  i do n't agree with shooting people either . 
  but if it was out of sufficient self defence then it is just imo . 
  refugees are fine , greedy economic migrants are not . 
  stop storming fences then . 
  why would you continue to smoke even if it was harmless anyway ? 
  i fucking hated smoking as a smoker ( cost , smell , etc ) and still hate it as an ex smoker . 
  one of the main proponents of far-leftism is anti-capitalism . 
  iirc rosengard was kinda shutdown and got merged with another district . 
  not sure if it 's still as bad as it used to be though . 
  the state wo n't let me have five wives and tax me on my neckbeard :( ( muh ethics !, 
  she 's brought another man home . 
  thousands of them infact . 
  you know its the good stuff . 
  i do , people who feel the need to get completely drunk out of their minds just to have a good time dont :d, 
  if you think / u/pingupingu is envious that he/she is n't waking up covered in puke shit and piss with your phone and your wallet missing , you need to raise your expectations . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6grvjys-ap4&amp;index=1&amp; :d, 
  quick !, 
  maybe it has beer in it !, 
  that might explain to some extent hungary 's current policy on migrants :p, 
  ** [ tutting intensifies ] **, 
  indeed . 
  it 's good to talk to someone at least . 
  i see a medical psychotherapist once a month , though it 's not exactly getting anywhere , he seems to just to regurgitate what i say , though i 've only seen him three times . 
  i pay for the privilege too , he 's considered one of the best in the west for my type of mental illness , but thankfully i can afford the fees . 
  i think if you have access to such weapons ( like a policeperson would have for example ) guns are probably the most surefire way to go about suicide with pretty much a 0 % failure rate compared to overdosing . 
  but yeah , suicide sucks . 
  been suicidal for a number of years , it 's always morbid thinking about what the ` best ' way to off yourself would be . 
  looks like the tag has been removed ? 
  is the post back up ? 
  no idea : s, 
   a polish/indian person is n't more subhuman than a british person . 
  o_o basically no one in the euroscepticism crowd here want to leave the eu on a racial basis . 
   hopefully somewhere in the far future we will not be separated by artificial borders . 
  i agree with you , but currently it 's a bit of a pipedream . 
  we do n't live in a utopia where every place is up to the standard of first world nations . 
  nope . 
  i do miss him though as lib dem leader , he was a better speaker than farron is . 
  ... how is this ` low quality ' ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idhc85tlpnq ) fucked me up for a few weeks as a kid . 
  animatronics really creep me out . 
  fuck that lion : <, 
  that might be a little forward . 
  we need to let them vote to ask them if that is okay first . 
  apple ? 
  i do \u00f3_\u00f3, 
  most people do n't take tumblrsexualities seriously . 
  some of us women like other women too , so it evens out , 
  in their minds sure , not everyone elses though, 
  yeah  i 've put them on my reading list . 
  maybe i 'll get round to it one day :d, 
  i want her on a poster in my room . 
  can you go into more detail ? 
  always wanted to know why sweden is the way it is now . 
  indeed . 
  the beauty of democracy . 
  if lots of people share your opinions , you can make it happen . 
  i 'll check it out . 
  looks a bit factual for me though . 
  aww yiss . 
  yeah . 
  edinburgh is pretty pretty . 
  i used to smoke malboros . 
  is this some vague reference ? 
  i think so too  she makes really good strawberry cheesecake . 
  we can just counterfeit them !,
