  well it 's not like they were going to put illustrations of homeless people smoking outside of greggs in them . 
  i mean sure , compared to say someone trying to move to australia from somalia , but as you said it should be easier i suppose . 
  i need to arrange for a holiday to australia for say a month i thinks . 
  in australia i 've been particularly looking at perth , and for canada vancouver or elsewhere in bc . 
  my only issues is going to be actually getting in to these countries . 
  i have n't read much on immigration to aus/can but i hear it 's a pain in the ass ( much like getting into the us ) i wish we had a free movement of peoples for the commonwealth :( would move abroad in a heartbeat . 
  i honestly do n't mind if aus ' politics are a bit more right wing ( i mean they 're not exactly fascist ) and in terms of anti-environmental ideas , that might change once abbot 's party is n't in charge any more . 
  i just want to go somewhere that is n't ... crowded to hell . 
  the uk ( at least where i live in the south ) is just concrete and more concrete . 
  i hate it . 
  i want to be able to be able to travel to the beach ( and i proper beach at that ) and just have a good time . 
  even if it is n't permanent , australia seems like a really nice place for british expats , same with canada . 
  australia/canada i 'm looking at . 
  seconded . 
  i live in kent and i shudder at the thought about having to travel into the city . 
  i have to on the fourth :( and the tube ... oh god the tube . 
  i go to portugal , germany or japan , clean , new , efficient , on time and fairly cheap transit . 
  the tube literally makes you sneeze up soot . 
  it 's god awful . 
  i just feel like having 20 showers in a row after using it . 
  for what it 's worth , i think the uk has a ` proud ' and incredibly rich history and we have been undeniably influential on the world , but it is not one that i have contributed to , so me being proud of it seems illogical . 
  in terms of the modern , i have no idea what we 're doing . 
  what do we want ? 
  are we european proper ? 
  are we little america ? 
  are we non of the above ? 
  unfortunately i can find far more negatives about the uk than i can positives . 
  i do n't associate with my home country at all and it 's quite upsetting to me that i feel almost stateless in terms of association . 
  i feel like i was born to be an expat . 
  i wonder if he was ever bullied by a minority in school . 
  that is a crime to facial hair . 
  oh , sorry for getting them mixed up :(, 
  skinheads are violent , why am i not surprised , 
  do n't mess it up \u00f3_\u00f3, 
  actually the pope is a satanic deathlord ready to doom us all, 
  86 % aww yiss . 
  he 's snooping lower and lower :(, 
  well that was rather silly was n't it kitty ? 
  which ? 
  muh socioeconomic factors, 
  i am rational with my vote , hence not using the compass to judge who i vote for , i think you misread me . 
  do n't forget it 's pretty green , and even if nuclear disasters are pretty epic in damage , more people probably die from coal fired power station pollutants than nuclear energy . 
  but green party and logic are polar opposites . 
  do n't you love us scotland ? 
  the rest are protesting a nuclear power station . 
  lots of working class people do n't , heck i know two self employed plumbers who voted tory and another who voted ukip . 
  labour has n't represented the workers since before blair . 
  do n't forget [ zoltan istvan 's transhumanist ] ( http://www.transhumanistparty.org/zoltanistvan.html ) party , who i would vote for if i was an american , 
   their political position is `` sitting and facing forward '' . 
  i love this as a break down of british politics by a brit . 
  they all suck . 
  as for the lib dems , i have no idea where they are going moving forward , possibly heading the pro-eu side on the referendum in 2016 , as ukip is probably going to lead the anti-eu bloc . 
  i 've done the political compass , always landed in the soft-left libertarian bloc , but i would be more inclined to vote for ukip than i would for green . 
  ( not that i would ever vote for either :( ), 
  well in that case i 'd probably recommending trying to find another story on the subject on a different media outlet and compare it to rt. 
  i usually read three or so newspapers/websites/etc for uk/eu news , one left , one right and one center ( ish ) and then make up my own mind on how i should feel about it :p, 
  would n't want to loose one of them :(, 
  rt maybe biased , but it did happen . 
  i wonder what the keys represent . 
  lol, 
  just because it 's from rt does n't mean the blasts did n't happen . 
  what about nude nu ` swedes ? 
  you can easily remove the np . 
  from a link and vote , and if you use a reddit app on mobile like alien blue , np . 
  does n't even work and you can vote normally . 
  their race has nothing to do with it .

  hey !, 
  northern ireland sucks too !, 
  in terms of a proper discussion on it we do n't seem to have , rather we have the `` romanians eat puppies '' scaremongering you 'd see from the daily mail and the like . 
  the former is what we need . 
  there is only one german country ? 
  it 's what hilter always wanted . 
  bnp still going ? 
  i think it 's just a small part of it all , immigration is such a delicate topic lots of media outlets and politicians dare touch it . 
  wanting to discuss immigration ( a very important topic facing europe currently ) makes me a fascist ? 
  it belongs in the megathread ! 11 / s, 
  this whole situation is really starting to piss people ( well , me ) off . 
  illegal migrants , striking workers setting fire to things , truck drivers delayed for days at a time in the uk trying to go through calais , eurostar considering suing uk and french govs for loss of profits , truck drivers having to act as the police because all the police seem to be doing is pulling illegals out from carriages ... why are they not been relocated , sent back home or at the very least put into temporary accommodation so they are n't just aimlessly running around the port like it 's a fucking joke ? 
  videos from calais make it out to just be a game of cat and mouse , with french authorities seemingly doing the bare minimum . 
  where the fuck is the eu in all this ? 
  if this is supposed to be an ` we 're all in this together ' about the migrant crisis , what are they doing ? 
  detroit went bankrupt due to a failing automotive industry did n't it ? 
  i mean , you 're comparing a city to a country , greece is in the situation it is in now because it is a serial debtor , joined an currency union that it was n't suited for and takes loans out to pay other loans . 
  we 're actually not european we 're uhh ... atlanticist ... us and iceland ... islands are different / s, 
   all we need is for enough old people to die . 
  it 's interesting how lots of things wrong in the world are connected to old farts with old values in positions in power , 
  / r/whataboutamerica, 
  yes , name calling will surely make people you disagree with go away . 
  keep fighting the good fight / s, 
  eesti is beesti, 
  it 's just bants kavos . 
  the little red car is adorably triumphant < 3, 
  probably healthier though and helped me quit , 
  and krone !, 
  we love you < 3, 
  how to break the eurozone in one sentence . 
  i hope it is n't arson . 
  annoyed with the current financial situation your country is in ? 
  i do n't blame you , but do n't start burning things !,
