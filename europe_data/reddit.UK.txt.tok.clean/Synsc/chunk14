  we 're different !, 
   soon enough it 's a crime to be a straight man . 
  damn it guys , he 's figured out our homosex agenda !, 
  you guys have every right to joke about it ^ ^, 
  oh humanity , we 're a fucking embarrassment are n't we ? 
   please , do not be racist and islamophobe . 
  do n't endorse the oppression women or the lgbt and then we can start talking . 
  edit : why the fuck is it non-muslims problem to sort out the issue islam has ? 
  change is only ever going to come from inside . 
  1994 quarter life crisis not being in a quarter life crisis, 
  and i 'm sure the right wing could say that about the left wing . 
  truth is people ca n't just shut down a decent debate between political philosophies by calling them shit and racists . 
  debate with your political opponents , do n't just call people names . 
  well obviously the millions who voted ukip here in the uk and the others who vote euroskeptic parties within europe seem to disagree with you . 
   ( do n't pull that rayleigh-scattering shit on me btw , that 's not the point . ), 
  so what is the point then ? 
  oof , even as a non-kipper i think that 's a bit harsh . 
  probably surnames ? 
  suuure , that 's what a swedish person would say !, 
  i mean it 's hard for me not to sound arrogant ( since i 'm from the uk and english is my native tongue ) but ... 
  this is an american website , the main language here is english , this subreddit uses english . 
  i do n't mind people doing the bilingual thing in comments ( i actually find it kinda interesting ) but yes , english should be put first just for simplicities sake . 
  edit : downvoted for trying to make things easier for people . 
  right . 
  gib doggerland, 
  thats what irritates me the most . 
  when you 're talking with someone and they bring their phone out . 
  either way it 's a problem . 
  phones are amazing but when they start interfering with rl then its a problem . 
  your housemates have a bit of a problem then :p, 
  yup the continent is going to just disappear into the sea, 
  and hilariously snide . 
  i 'm sure most of us do n't have lives revolving around social media, 
  at least we did better than the germans . 
  and we beat them in the woman 's world cup , so we 've got that going for us !, 
  colonies with a side order of freedom cheese ^ ^ ^ ^ tm, 
  because we can !, 
   also , all cheese in the us are definitely kraft singles . 
  yep . 
  no ignorance there . 
  i totally was n't being serious either . 
  you obviously have n't spent much time here in the uk then , because if you did you 'd realise we really do n't take ourselves seriously enough to warrant such a response < 3 just do n't tell me you consider your cheese actual cheese and not yellow slabs of arse , 
  / u/chieftah for best op 2015 . 
  you 're svalcome . 
   prepare your orifices for mass quantities of maple syrup . 
  i think i saw a porno of that once . 
  mock our sunday roasts and we may have to colonise you , 
  press 123 for free euros, 
  we can hear the hon hon hon from across the channel . 
  do n't you mean slovakia ? 
  must be the money face man coming to help the greek people . 
  they 're is they are . 
  their is ownership . 
  do n't tell me how to speak my own language , especially if you ca n't even do it properly yourself . 
  `` persecution of muslims '' mate . 
  i 'm a lesbian and i think i 'll be the one getting persecuted by muslims in a few decades . 
  thats why i 'm ironically voting more right than i used to be , because i have fears in that regard and no one but the right wants to pay attention to me . 
  the mainstream has failed them , and anyone who votes for the far right/left . 
  if you want people to stay moderate pay attention to what their saying rather than taking their vote for granted . 
  the eu and how it operates is a world away from the average european, 
  could n't expect anything different from a scot , 
  read their manifesto ? 
  like ukip the media tells us they 're racist so we do n't bother to think for ourselves / s, 
  london really is a different beast entirely than the rest of the country . 
  oh my god , i just realised that i 'm actually supportive of those dirty nazis !, 
  better vote for a party that 'll just import more nazis instead !, 
  i did n't say christian did i ? 
  not i did n't say christians . 
  people always go ` yeah well what about christians ? ', 
  terrorism in the name of jesus is just as stupid, 
  i never claimed they are good . 
  i want us to stop messing about in countries that have nothing to do with us in the same way i do n't want religious twats killing people or oppressing people . 
  masks do n't oppress women . 
  if there was a significant risk from a higher chance of ` mask wearing ' and ` terrorism ' then i 'm sure they would be banned . 
  also , if masks were banned , should we ban welding face gear ? 
  hence why there is no laws opposing it here . 
  easier to identify people , harder to conceal things , banning straight up public displays of oppression which should offend anyone that believes women should have the same rights as men . 
  any that 's happened in europe on the same scale as islam ? 
  any jewish or christian isis 's ? 
  thats horrible of course , but its not in the name of religion now is it ? 
  it has absolutely got to do with your point lol . 
  if i said ' i fucking love cheesecake ' then you might have a reason to say that . 
  i 've been banned for comments taken out of context here :(, 
  its a tiny minority of nutcases and reddit thinks every uni student is like this and they blow everything out of proportion . 
  i do n't see any buddhists or jews shooting up concerts and blowing themselves up . 
  edit : in europe, 
  this is just east asia propaganda !, 
  airstrip one is the best !, 
  * in the skyyy *, 
   the swedish and finnish has the same layout , except we do n't use those filthy \u00d8 \u00c6 letters . 
  heretic . 
   there are far more attractive women than men in those photos . 
  which is good if you are a man  i take it you 're a straight dude then . 
   fatties everywhere here , amazed we have n't sunk beneath the waves . 
  i like to think of it like this . 
  in the shitty town i live in it is full of fuglies . 
  which means for average 5-6/10 looking girl i get bumped up into a 8/10 . 
  oooh typical german with your ** rules ** and ** regulations ** on the queens english mate, 
  rawr . 
  i do like american accents though , probably because for us they are foreign :p,
