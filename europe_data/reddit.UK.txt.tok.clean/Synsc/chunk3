  why do people keep using eu and europe interchangeability . 
  do n't worry , the media will go to full blown panic and hysteria mode in the coming months up to the referendum and we 'll be scared into staying in . 
  does n't really affect me personally , since i 'm planning on emigrating in the coming years , 
  not his asshole silly , just a fucking one . 
  there are mistakes then there are colossal fuck ups . 
  you guys are more european than turkey or azerbaijan could ever be . 
  could that title be any more guardian lol, 
  you 're about 100 years too late, 
  and me not that kind of orc, 
  british is a political construct . 
  by nationality and culture yes , but not ethnically . 
  \u014d_\u014d i 'll pretend you did n't say that !, 
  i think they need to be realistic . 
  i do n't blame them for being idealistic , but life is n't black and white and you ca n't then approach it with black and white politics . 
  uganda is n't in nato either , uganda is safe . 
  what about ukraine ? 
  they lost their nukes . 
  look what happened to them . 
  i just think his global isolationism is n't that good . 
  how would n't they do shit ? 
  warheads is enough to wipe out the entire continent . 
  / r/uk is such a circlejerk right now . 
  it 's always been intensely left . 
   let 's be honest ; in a nuclear war , trident would n't do shit nuclear bombs are a deterrent , not a weapon . 
  the main goal of actually having trident is to prevent anyone who is n't a complete idiot from attacking us . 
  leaving nato plus ridding trident completely is just really foolish , especially since corbyn is a fan of russia . 
  leaving nato and scrapping trident is basically saying to the international community `` hey , i 'm defenceless , come occupy me '', 
  you ca n't just print money and expect it to maintain it 's value . 
  if it did we would just print money to pay off the debt . 
  time to start giving out some opium then , 
  you iberians can keep your hair . 
  i 'll take all the smooth guys . 
  i like comrades glorious peoples traktor . 
  i find it funny . 
  `` i 'm a turkish nationalist but i live in germany ... because germany is better than turkey ? '', 
  i do n't follow the logic . 
  sidebar , works on desktop only, 
  to je sramota :( well you could move there if you can afford to/find a job there :p, 
  oh how convenient , 
  we still prefer to move to aus than america though ^ ^, 
  why croatia ? 
  seems like quite a random place to go to . 
  ( \u0e07 \u0360 \u00b0 \u035f\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) \u0e07 beat those krauts again 3-0 3-0 !, 
  d'aww . 
  30 mbps in the rural ? 
  i live in london suburbia and 30 is my max . 
  my nan in yorkshire does n't even have wifi . 
  thanks , 
  even though uruguay is one of the best southern american countries . 
  did n't he mod like 200 subreddits ? 
  i doubt powermods actually contribute that often . 
   is the conversation volume here representative of the conversation volume outside the internet ? 
  probably not . 
  lots of the stuff i read here if said at the workplace for example and people would be out of their jobs . 
  i do n't remember any mods being removed , but they do definitely seem less active than they used to be . 
  itt : people both on the left and right loosing their collective shit . 
  cuddle not clubble :(, 
  thats two steps away from 88 !?!, 
  you nazi asdifkjasdklfjsklad, 
  i did n't vote for it . 
  http://www.migrantsrights.org.uk/files/publications/migrant_voters_2015_paper.pdf page 10 . 
  it 's not ` conspiracy gullibility ' its pure fact that immigrants will vote for pro-immigration ( who tend to be almost always left wing ) parties . 
  europe does not equal the eu . 
  yup . 
  the last week or so has been oh so very weird . 
  but it was so subtle, 
  yay !, 
  the terrible warzone in central europe . 
  i know , but do n't shoot the messenger . 
  in fact since i posted this my opinion of him went down dramatically because of a trans-hate video he made . 
   then there 's conspiracy bullshit like leftist governments inviting immigrants so they get more votes it makes sense though , does n't it ? 
  here in the uk at least most of not all immigrants will vote for left wing parties . 
  the bigger the immigrant population , the bigger the vote share , even if leftist governments/parties do n't do it on purpose , modern left parties/governments are pro mass immigration . 
  at least it 'll be a pretty ruin once their oil runs out . 
  ashens pls, 
  [ oh america , our hilarious brother  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnartufggts ), 
  historically poland has been pretty badass militarily though , 
  oh fine , puppy eyes . 
  i 'll take it back , as long as you get a flair : ' 3, 
  if you think everyone but you is an asshole , most likely you 're the asshole , 
  the uk can come too ? 
  ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ nordic ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ swear, 
  you heartless * xenophobic * monster, 
  they are escaping the warzone that is central europe / s, 
  some pretty weird balls . 
  at least europe 's penis ( scandinavia ) is bigger than america 's ( florida ), 
  leave little suomi alone :(, 
  for me my concern is n't so much an economic one , it 's a social/cultural one . 
  importing hundreds of thousands of people who have a completely different way of life to us is n't a good thing . 
  france , this is why we always pick you last in team selection :(, 
  ah that 's interesting food for thought , thank you . 
  i just keep seeing around reddit of people who say ` some mods are trying to push x agenda ! ', 
  etc etc and did n't really know what to make of it . 
  good !, 
  it 's just like when i see moderators of like 200 odd subs ( not you ) i just think that it 's a gang of people who just get moderation status and not do anything . 
  like power users or something . 
  lol, 
  mum * what is this americanised english ? 
  do you would now ? 
  i do n't know how you can mod 24 subreddits and work full time at the same time .
