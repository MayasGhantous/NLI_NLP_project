  if you lived here you 'd know people are n't just dying in the streets . 
  i think he 's seen downton abbey and has never been to bradford . 
  i do n't even know any more , i 'm just acting stereotypically . 
  i just think we should be focusing on our own people rather than tackling the world 's problems first . 
  you 're the one calling me a xenophobe , i never said the uk should n't take loads of refugees , i just said germany has a tendency to boss everyone around . 
  but camerons right , you ca n't just keep taking refugees . 
  maybe if our politicians did n't bomb the living fuck out of their countries , there would n't be so many . 
  i 'm english , what do you think ? 
  the only employment i can control is my own , but that does n't explain why our unemployment rates are still above 5 % . 
  seriously ? 
  the uk is one of the most multicultural countries on this planet . 
  most people here have no qualms with refugees . 
  it 's the economic migrants that we 're upset about . 
  we have n't got the jobs to give . 
  and germany calling out of xenophobia , fucking classic . 
  people seem to forget it was germany that brought europe into war arguably twice , failed both times and was probably the most racist place in europe for a good part of 20 years , and now germany has the audacity to try and boss the continent again from its tower of morals ? 
  germany is the one country that appears to be bossing the rest of the eu around when it comes to making them take refugees . 
  not only that , germany is encouraging more to come by accepting every syrian . 
  i do n't know much about georgia . 
  you guys have a famous female chess player with the best voice ever https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp8j4vfiiwu, 
  d'aww . 
  under the english channel no doubt ? 
  why ? 
  saying `` the borderland ( s ) '' as a country name seems pretty insulting :p, 
  you did n't answer my question, 
  yes that must explain why it appears 80 % of them are working age men . 
  where the fuck are the elderly , women , children ? 
  even then its not exactly racist . 
  ; ~ ; b-but - : c, 
  satire . 
  it would help if op 's decide to find media in a non-english language that they offer a translation or english source too . 
  i do n't mind people using their native tongue , but for ease of access it helps . 
  for fuck sake . 
  literally no one here cares what race they are . 
  people dislike their faith , which does not fit with our western values and its what partly causes all the violence in their countries . 
  calling people racist does n't make them so . 
  i just do n't want islam ( the religion that hangs gays and treats women like walking vaginas ) in my continent . 
  entitled in the sense that they are demanded free travel . 
  he said sharia does n't exist here when it clearly does . 
  it 's highly relevant . 
  maximum overgrumble, 
  the entitlement is real . 
  i 'm surprised eurostar has n't sued someone yet for loss of profits . 
  also looking at your history , you seem to have a real issue with europeans . 
  sorry about that mate , if we annoy you so much why do n't you fuck off out of our subreddits ? 
  you 're calling europeans hypocrites when it comes to racism ? 
  blacks in america twice as likely to be shot by cops http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32740523 `` african americans now constitute nearly 1 million of the total 2.3 million incarcerated population african americans are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of whites together , african american and hispanics comprised 58 % of all prisoners in 2008 , even though african americans and hispanics make up approximately one quarter of the us population '' http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet, 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  who wanted to go into these wars ? 
  our politicians and elite . 
  who suffers ? 
  the people . 
   mainly the ones who throw away their documents , so they ca n't be deported well that 's a flawed system . 
  it 's to do with culture , not skin colour . 
  if anything you 're tracist for assuming we mean colour . 
  considering the biggest immigrant population in australia is brits and the fact that you have so many people from these nations going to other of these nations its kinda dumb it does n't exist . 
  i mean even i plan to immigrate to either canada or aus eventually . 
   what ? 
  there is n't ?!, 
  i had no idea !, 
  not sure if you 're being sarcastic or genuinely did n't know that . 
  [ they hinted at the idea a bit ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/free-movement-between-canada-u-k-australia-and-new-zealand-unlikely-1.3001945 ) but nope , does n't exist :( yet  , 
  do n't ruin my dreams :( ^ ^ ^ gib ^ ^ ^ free ^ ^ ^ movement ^ ^ ^ between ^ ^ ^ uk/aus/nz / canada ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ riot ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  ~ ~ greece was n't financially capable for being allowed in the eurozone to begin with - greece 's fault ~ ~ ~ ~ the eu accepted them anyway - eu 's fault ~ ~ ~ ~ greek economy fucks up - greece 's fault ~ ~ ~ ~ eu pours money into greece - ?? 
  ? ~ ~ ~ ~ greece starts taking loans to pay off the interest of the previous loans - greece 's fault ~ ~ bleh point is , the eu should n't have accepted them into the eurozone to start with , and then when they started getting problems the party that was voted in based on ` not taking shit from the eu anymore ' goes and gets another bailout , now making greece a debt slave to the eu . 
  basically , everyone fucked up and politicians are stupid . 
   europe do n't leave us as victims for smugglers so it 's our fault you decided to give them your money in the first place ? 
   because we are not living in socialism . 
  it 's not the duty of the government to provide the working population with housing . 
  most of europe is under some form of social democracy . 
  public housing is not socialism . 
  providing someone new residence before you knock their home down is n't socialism , it 's decency . 
  you tend to hear about people being kicked out of their homes with no alternative in places like china , where the communist party ( by name , only ) literally do n't give a shit about their population . 
   nobody is making people homeless by the way . 
  these people will find new flats elsewhere . 
  be it in the same city or somewhere else . 
  if you have literally no money , you ca n't find ` new flats somewhere ' . 
  i do n't see how you ca n't understand that some people are dirt poor . 
  literally zilch in their bank accounts after paying for food and other essentials . 
  if they could afford to find ` new flats somewhere ' they probably would have moved prior to destruction . 
   we also did not have people living in buildings supposed to be demolished . 
  so why did n't your government pay for new housing for these people ? 
  you ca n't just make people homeless . 
  he looks like he 'd rather be wrestling bears topless . 
   i guess it 's because to get there as a woman they had to be absolutely exceptional people already . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  in an area where you are disadvantaged , you will tend to do better than your privileged peers who do n't have to work so hard to ` prove ' themselves . 
  [ yeah , sharia totally does n't exist in europe / s ] ( http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-qa-sharia-law-uk/18486 ) islam in this form needs to fuck off and die . 
  everywhere . 
   nobody forces these people to live there . 
  considering in another comment you mentioned how you 've [ never been in a position with minimum wage ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3j82go/if_we_rescued_the_banks_we_can_save_refugees/cunbj5a?context=3 ) , i take it you really do n't know what it is like being poor . 
  being dirt poor forces you to live there . 
  lots of people ca n't just get up and move . 
  you mean the eu acting as loan sharks against greece and greece stupidly accepting it ? 
   theres still a long way before the eu can give us orders on what to do . 
  uhh , that 's basically the eu 's job . 
  trust me it 's frustrating for lots of us brits too :p, 
  no one really knows . 
  probably more for staying in right now at least . 
  it 's annoying though .
