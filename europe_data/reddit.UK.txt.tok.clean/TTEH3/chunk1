i assume you 'll be voting for independence . 
  what do you think the outcome will be ? 
  but only one country i can see ( ireland ) imports predominantly from the uk . 
  you 're a dumb comparison . 
  i have to agree , for the most part . 
  our food is less lah-de-dah and more big , hearty meals designed to fill you up . 
  pasties ( really popular in the south west - pastry packed with beef , potato , and swede/onion ) were designed for working cornish miners who needed a quick , filling meal . 
  same goes for things like the full english breakfast etc. 
  semantics . 
  we 're `` countries within a country '' , but that 's confusing . 
  when someone says `` scotland/england/wales / ni is n't a country '' , you know what they mean . 
  agreed . 
  it depends a lot on where you are . 
  you 'll see more over-cautious parents in london and larger cities than you would where i am , the south west , and other parts of the country . 
  i 'm from a fairly large family and while all of my siblings who have kids are good parents , none of them prevent their child from being a child . 
  this is n't new . 
  the ` marokkanenprobleem ' is n't new . 
  true to a degree , but for every person who mollycoddles their child and is terrified of every stranger being a paedo , there are 10 people who do n't and are n't . 
  the tabloids certainly love scaremongering stories , but media circuses about paedophiles are not unique to these islands . 
  he referenced this in one of his speeches . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18354459 rather funny . 
   because the word is forte . 
  pronounced the same as in fort knox . 
  nl ca n't into relevance , 
  are they ? 
  kosovo is a state . 
  out of interest : what exactly about that was flemish ? 
  just a little correction : it 's * a european * , not * an european * , because european is pronounced with a * y * sound , so it gets * a * not * an * . 
  that does n't seem like a problem to me . 
  but i think the entire map ought to be blue , and that criminal defamation is a joke . 
  yes , but it 's a ** lot ** harder to argue than in court , than it is in most european or commonwealth countries , because first amendment . 
  no , that 's why you take them to court for a civil wrong . 
  fuck yes , exeter . 
  maybe i will . 
  maybe i 'll go make my own reddit , with blackjack . 
  and hookers . 
  i hate how reddit uses op to mean the parent comment in a thread . 
  for posts , not comments . 
  posts . 
  nowhere else on the internet does this . 
  grinds my gears . 
  it 's as different as it could be . 
  finland * was * sweden & ndash ; an integral part of the country , for 500 + years . 
  india was never considered to be part of britain in any similar sense , only part of the empire . 
  finland was once an integral part of sweden , whereas india was never a part of britain -- just under british rule as part of the empire . 
  cornish is undergoing a revival . 
  the numbers look bad if you do n't read them in context ( i.e. 
  they 've increased , in the last 50 years ) . 
  i 'm glad the uk is still at 60 % , and +3 too . 
  it 's nice that people have n't completely lost faith in us . 
  i think you hit the nail on the head . 
  people expect more from the uk , just as we do from other european countries . 
  people see the direction may is leading our country in , and ( rightly , imo ) dislike her for that . 
  we all know what to expect from russia , on the other hand , so there 's less surprise . 
  imo/e , mitterand was rather well-respected in the uk . 
  he supported the uk during the falklands war , for example , disallowing sales of french weaponry to argentina , allowing the uk to use french ports , etc. , despite facing [ opposition ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17256975 ) for this at home . 
  how are people not understanding this ? 
  you realise you quoted something that agrees with what he said , right ? 
  it was n't really pr , but i think it 's nicer for dutch people to think of it as invading and occupying the uk , as opposed to the historical reality of a welcome coup . 
  lol 'd . 
  as if that had anything to do with it . 
  make one for the us and the soviet union . 
  or modern-day venezuela and some freer south american state . 
  ooh , or syria and jordan . 
  * this is what / r/europe actually believe *, 
  nor me , but this thread seems to be a `` hey guys look at how awful the uk is '' one , so i 'll be quiet . 
   tomfromlondon london . 
  there 's your problem . 
  boom boom boom boom *** boom ***, 
  the uk invented vulgar and crude political drawings . 
  it 's our thing . 
  everything bad = eu . 
  competition is pretty good , though coverage is poorer in some rural areas . 
  my town of about 10,000 people has 11 isps available , and 32 plans . 
  prices ranging from # 17.99 / mo for 17mbps down and 2mbps up , to # 42.99 for 76mbps down and 10mbps up . 
  all but two of those plans are unlimited , though i only know for sure that bt and talktalk 's plans are `` actually '' unlimited . 
  i pay # 26/mo for 52mbps/10mbps for bt infinity ( fibre ) , which is unlimited and [ does n't traffic shape/manage ] ( http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/119325-bt-infinity-now-totally-unlimited ) . 
  there 's a group called the [ broadband stakeholder group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/broadband_stakeholder_group ) which a forum between isps and the uk government . 
  all large and medium isps are members of the bsg , and [ all major ] ( http://telecoms.com/382622/all-uk-isps-now-committed-to-bsgs-open-internet-code/ ) isps agreed to the `` open internet code '' the bsg put forward , which promotes net neutrality . 
  it 's not the * best * agreement , for example it does n't forbid isps from zero-rating , but it 's nice to see actual sensible self-regulation . 
  virgin media are n't violating their own agreement , as i said in my reply above :  `` zero-rating a service as part of a pay monthly plan does n't violate the eu 's rules [ or ] * the voluntary agreement * . '', 
  is that a shame ? 
  sure . 
  i personally do n't think net neutrality necessitates forbidding zero-rating , but if you read up on the agreement you 'll see uk isps are in favour of net neutrality . 
  they have n't even voiced opposition to regulations , which is saying something . 
   `` net neutrality is a load of bollocks '' - virgin media ceo . 
  the personal opinion , from 2008 , of a man who left virgin media 4 years ago . 
   https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548910/virgin-media-zero-rating-uk-europe yes , they are . 
  zero-rating a service as part of a pay monthly plan does n't violate the eu 's rules , the voluntary agreement , or the `` understanding '' between isps and the uk gov ' t ( basically part of the agreement ) . 
  it 's unfortunate , but it 's something only virgin media do currently . 
   they do n't gie a fuck about net neutrality and have been very open about it . 
  [ ee , virgin media and vodafone are last of the uk 's major internet service providers to sign up to open internet code of practice ] ( http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240238396/ee-virgin-media-and-vodafone-sign-net-neutrality-pledge ) [ all uk isps now committed to bsg 's open internet code ] ( http://telecoms.com/382622/all-uk-isps-now-committed-to-bsgs-open-internet-code/ )  * this means that all the major uk isps operating across both fixed and mobile networks have now signed up to the code , which commits them to provide full and open internet access products with no blocked services ; provide greater transparency in instances where certain classes of legal content , applications and services are unavailable on a product ; and re-affirms that unreasonable traffic management practices will not be used to target and degrade the services of a competitor . 
  *  * providers will be able to raise potential cases of targeted and negative discrimination with isps , which , if not satisfactorily resolved , can be lodged with the broadband stakeholder group ( bsg ) for referral to ofcom and the government . 
  *  * ofcom said the code provides an `` effective self-regulatory model '' that fulfils a `` key part of government policy on net neutrality '' .

  i think you 're confused .
