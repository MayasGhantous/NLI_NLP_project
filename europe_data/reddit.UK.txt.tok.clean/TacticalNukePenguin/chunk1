a bit of knowledge along with the older generation of daily mail readers popping their clogs and we 'll be on our way !, 
  in an ** ideal ** world , for me , i 'd like to see the eu more integrated . 
  i know there are many arguments against it , but i think that a full federal model would make the eu stronger overall . 
  so bring fiscal control into the european parliament . 
  i 'm not sure exactly how i 'd go about making the transition from national governments to federal governments , but that 's the direction that i 'd like to go . 
  get to a point where the decisions of one state are n't bringing down all of the other states , and where companies ca n't get massive trade bonuses in one country because they 've got their head office in a country that has different corporate laws . 
  i think countries like the uk and denmark should be given the choice to either become full members or leave the union . 
  i 'd like for both of them to go all in , but on a domestic level i know there 'd be wide spread opposition to that ( as i 'm sure there would be to my federalisation ideal ) . 
  really i 'd want an all in union . 
  federal states that can do their own thing , but a central government ( that does n't necessarily have its fingers in everyone 's pies ) to give a strong back bone . 
  ** realistically ** , i expect very little to have changed . 
  a few more member states ( bulgaria , ukraine , etc. 
  ) , but the uk ( or ruk depending on how the referendum goes in scotland ) and denmark will still stand apart . 
  i imagine there will be a bit of a shift to the right for quite a lot of member states . 
  maybe not by much , but a shift , probably in retaliation to continued immigration and to the middle east , israel , north africa , etc. 
  countries like greece , spain , portugal , i can see them shifting a bit further to the right than countries who are n't still struggling from the recession . 
  there will still be conflicting objectives for each nation . 
  germany will still be a power house moving towards green energy . 
  spain will still be struggling with high unemployment . 
  if scotland gets independence from the uk , i imaging there will be bigger pushes from other areas wanting to separate from larger countries ... 
  who were they polling for this ? 
  the leaders of each country and they had to have their arms wide open to say that they 're `` thhhhhiiiiiiis happy !, 
   if the french celebrity who announces the points speaks french instead of english like the rest of europe i 'm just going to down a pint because this is really annoying . 
  better than some of the stuff that 's getting pretty high scores : /, 
  and ukraine as well ? 
  not even romania ? 
  well i know what all of my friends and family are getting for chrismas this year then . 
  stephanie mayer , in her new series to be released next week , and the sequel following the day after . 
  really ? 
  i think romania is going to get some sneaky votes for being ridiculous . 
  well that should be easy . 
  we use eurovision kind of like the `` make a wish '' foundation , it 's cheaper than sending them anywhere in the uk . 
  was that hodor at the start ? 
  how do you think i ended up with them ?!, 
  it 's the one weekend a year the ex is adamant that i have them . 
  for the children . 
  although with that amount of beer , i 'm not sure i should be responsible for the kids tonight ... 
  i 'm not sure which would kill you first .

  hardcore drinkers rules : drink every time you see a butterfly . 
  well there 's one i wo n't have to drink for . 
  ( uk ) edit : i may have to eat my own words, 
  i 'm terrible at football console games so i 've been doing this for years !, 
  i think it was a bit more tactical from cameron . 
  i just hope that [ this ] ( http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/people-are-really-really-hoping-this-theory-about-david-cameron-and-brexit-is-true--bjhqbql0vz ) is closer to the truth than the concept that britain will actually leave the eu at all . 
  that 's one of the best analogies i 've seen so far . 
  do you have a source for this at all ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36515213 ) article , the majority were n't english , but they were the only nationality to have been arrested . 
  oh , there 's cabbage in british cuisine too . 
  oh shit , i 've really not been paying enough attention to the countries !, 
  did you miss yodel it !, 
  wales !, 
  from a village close to cardiff, 
  probably australia to be honest . 
  and then if the spiders , sharks , crocs and snakes got to me , i could always vote for canada the following year . 
  what a load of bull . 
  theresa may is an incompetent blaggard who should have been kicked out of the cabinet when she made her first faux pas , or even her twenty first - . -, 
  there 's also a market for the daily mail but that does n't make it a good thing , 
  indian mother , but born and raised in the uk i believe, 
  i never said they were musicians . 
  at best they 're irritating for money , and whenever they 're on tv there is a collective groan that stretches from john o'groats to lands end . 
  i blame his lack of being a sexy dancing woman . 
  he 's not the most entertaining to watch , but when i first heard the song on the radio i was quite impressed . 
  next up , worldvision !, 
  where you can vote for the country you want citizenship for . 
  we used to , back in the day when you had to send a pigeon and hope that it got to the polls in time . 
  just put forward an act singing in french and no one would know !, 
  to be fair , even without knowing the country , i think just having some sexy folks on stage really helps . 
  if people had just listened to engelbert and not seen him , we 'd 've done better than we did . 
  he 's just not someone you can look at and vote for at the same time . 
  i fucking hate jedward and i think i speak for musicians all across the uk . 
   edit3 : nooo , damn you denmark . 
  atleast we are beating the brits ooops . 
  well considering some of the acts we 've sent forwards over the past 10 years ... we may as well have not entered . 
  i think one of the rules for the uk is that we ca n't put forward anyone who 's got a big record deal so muse would be out of the question :(, 
  i 'm not even sure if people would recognise that as a minimum speed limit sign as it is . 
  it would probably be a case of update the laws , make that the new system for new drivers , and then ease the rest of us onto it ... 
  bring it on . 
  it will take decades to fit in everywhere , but as kids are taught solely in metric , things will change . 
  dual signs for roads , at first it will have to be clear with mph/kph after the relevant number , or simply have red ringed speed limits as mph and blue for kph , eventually phasing out the red ringed mph signs a few years down the line ... no doubt people will be a bit peeved about it , but it 's an unnecessary barrier to the continent . 
  it would also help to boost public spending to make the changes and hopefully improve our economy ... 
  i liked it there . 
  even though the lights went out twice whilst there . 
  we had a good time though . 
  up until driving to kiev and the police were complete dicks the whole way . 
  stopped 10 times in one day and in the end i pulled some strings with the embassy in kiev so was picked up by an embassy car 50miles out of kiev to get us into town - . - but it pays to know the right people , 
  sure the centre is nice enough but the suburbs ... there 's a cobbled highway out of there !, 
  we stayed at the grand because we could n't find our hostel xd but there was an ace restaurant that was in the basement with a suite of armour in the doorway :p, 
  interesting name for the subreddit , 
  maybe posting r/travel :d, 
  i guess it could be pest with all the tall tenements ( as in the east side of budapest ) but i ca n't be certain . 
  at first i was thinking possibly ukraine but it does n't look hilly enough for kiev and that 's only got one or two beautiful parts . 
  actually , check the op 's username , he 's ukrainian so i would guess that it is ukraine . 
  i 've only been to a couple of cities in ukraine and have a lot of bad memories between them :p, 
  look at how well germany is doing compared to italy and france ... i know who i 'd side with on this one . 
  at first i was expecting a pizza or something like that , but good call :d,
