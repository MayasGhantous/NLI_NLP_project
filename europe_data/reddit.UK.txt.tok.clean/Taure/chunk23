  in the past , if you conquered an area you did it for the land and natural resources . 
  as destructive as war was , the land was still there afterwards . 
  this does n't work for modern economies . 
  you ca n't annex innovation or legal systems and war tends to destroy infrastructure . 
  the act of war would destroy the very thing you envied about the country you are invading . 
  more than anything else , it is the shift of economies away from primary and secondary industry which has eliminated war between western nations . 
  he said national sovereignty is incompatible with eu wide democracy , not supranational sovereignty . 
  economic interdependency existed before the eu and would have continued to develop without the eu . 
  the eu accelerated it , but it did n't create it out of nothing . 
  the costs of war between large western nations would have been absurdly high with or without the eu . 
  essentially : france wanted a nuclear powered carrier , uk did n't . 
  low resolution , but here 's a photo of the naval review at the queen 's coronation : http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02236/fleet_2236926a.jpg, 
  i 'm a europhile but i 've never been able to get behind the argument that the eu prevents wars . 
  does anyone really think that the eu nations would have gone to war with each other in the last 60 years if not for the eu ? 
  wars in western europe have not occurred simply because of the huge costs involved for little benefit . 
  principal armament : the cheerleader effect . 
  relative to denmark 's size , that is n't such a small navy . 
  make sure to note the numbers next to each picture denoting how many ships of that class denmark has . 
  the nuclear thing i do n't mind so much . 
  a nuclear aircraft carrier is still limited by the logistical needs of the non-nuclear ships in the carrier group , so having a nuclear powered carrier does n't really bring any logistical benefits in practice . 
  and it 's a lot more expensive . 
  the really irritating thing is that they changed from catobar to stovl to save a relatively small amount of money . 
  that means lower sortie rates , no ability to operate interchangeably with us carriers , and the use of the inferior f-35b ( compared to the f-35c ) . 
   behavior that 's constantly exhibited by the side you claim your vote is swinging towards . 
  except it is n't . 
  the eurosceptics make a lot of bad economic arguments , and often terribly unrealistic predictions , but at least they respect their opponents . 
  i 've never once seen a eurosceptic imply that certain groups of people are not entitled to have political opinions simply by virtue of the fact that those opinions differ from their own . 
   i hate to break the obvious to you : but if you let your vote on something so important be influenced by people venting frustration on reddit , you do n't really care about the quality of arguments in the first place . 
  i did say * slowly * eroding . 
  and the attitude of the people of europe towards britain is far from irrelevant . 
  there 's no point being in a union with a group of people who hate you . 
   cons :   having to listen to euroskeptics bitch and moan . 
  you missed a con : - attempts to silence perfectly legitimate political views via the use of emotive , dismissive language . 
  seriously , this attitude on the sub is slowly eroding my resolve to vote `` stay '' . 
  i 've yet to see the eurosceptics make a convincing argument ... but the anti-eurosceptics are beginning to do their work for them . 
  you realise that the church of scientology planned and executed a moderately successful infiltration of the us government ? 
  many of scientology 's early leadership was convicted of criminal offences in relation to it . 
  ** pros ** - access to the single market which is a significant boost to economic growth ( larger `` domestic '' market , harmonisation of standards , pan-european specialisation , more fdi , more investment opportunities ) . 
  - freedom of labour bringing many productive , educated people of working age with european values to the uk . 
  - ability to negotiate as part as a powerful bloc in international trade deals . 
  - certain parts of eu regulation such as the working time directive . 
  - vehicle for cooperation of green energy/climate change . 
  - dutch women . 
  and polish women . 
  and spanish women . 
  and french women . 
  women . 
  ** cons ** - single market is incomplete in a way that disadvantages britain relative to other eu nations ( freedom of labour and goods is more or less complete , freedom of services and capital are still underdeveloped ) . 
  - ez nations sometimes try to use eu regulations to sabotage britain for their own gain . 
  examples : ecb euro clearing house regulations ( struck down as illegal by the ecj ) , financial transactions tax , bonus caps for banking industry only . 
  - democratic deficit and general constitutional spaghetti , often due to eu expansion being in response to crises instead of carefully planned . 
  - weak ability to deal with crises . 
  - most eu nations do not pull their weight on military spending . 
  - tendency of the competition commission to use anti-trust investigations as a vehicle of protectionism , often to limit the implementation of technological advances that come from foreign firms . 
  - ecj that places achievement of the eu 's goals above the rule of law . 
  - rest of eu is significantly more socialist than the uk and tends to enact regulations accordingly . 
  ( though this list has more cons than pros , that does n't mean the eu is a net negative . 
  you also have to think of the weighting each point has . ), 
  except ... it 's not a tax . 
  it 's a charge for using a service ( roads ) . 
  also happened when i took the eurostar . 
  it seems likely that even then , the netherlands and germany had some kind of arrangement for reduced border checks . 
  every time i 've left the uk i 've had my passport checked , whether i was travelling to eu countries ( including france ) or non-eu . 
  i 'm not sure the treaty would be relevant any more , since the comments made by this minister basically amount to saying that he 'd throw the treaty away . 
  not sure that france has a leg to stand on here . 
  standard international practice is for passports to be checked when leaving a country . 
  if france stops checking passports of people travelling to the uk , the inevitable response is that the uk stops checking passports of people travelling to france . 
  no one wants that . 
  everyone loses . 
  bbc at 1:17 and denmark at 4:41 are suspiciously similar . 
  i think looking at the foreign born population is slightly misleading . 
  i mean , the uk has a 13 % foreign born population too , but there 's so many differences between the us and the uk . 
  a lot of the usa 's diversity and racial tensions come from a historical legacy that the uk lacks . 
  the eu can barely even agree to an extremely mild set of sanctions on russia . 
  and yet you think the eu would place a complete economic sanction on the uk ? 
  lol . 
  i think it 's still a bit early to be passing any judgment on the euro one way or another . 
  it is n't even 2 decades old yet . 
  in the long run ( i.e. 
  by 2100 ) , one suspects that britain will wish it could have joined . 
   it has counter balanced the french desire for ever closer union , the same thing that produced the euro this is probably the most harmful misconception in the eu right now . 
  historically , the uk has not opposed greater union . 
  it has been one of the major drivers towards strengthening the eu . 
  it 's just that the uk 's focus has always been on expanding and deepening the single market rather than political union . 
  it was the uk that basically wrote the single european act , which more or less made the single market a reality . 
  and the uk was one of the main champions of expanding the single market in 2004 . 
  brexit aside , this continues to the present day , with the uk being the main voice calling for the eu to make real progress on services and capital markets union ( to which the eu is legally committed just as much as free movement of goods and labour ) . 
  think about that for a bit . 
  then think about your flair . 
  free movement is not the same thing as `` borderless '' . 
  free movement means i have the legal right to enter your country . 
  borderless means no passport control . 
  you can still have free movement with a border , e.g. 
  the uk border with france . 
  french people need passport/id to enter the uk , but they have the legal right to enter . 
  the uk can not deny any eu citizen entry . 
  membership of eea means you have to accept free movement - i.e. 
  eu citizens have the legal right to enter your country . 
  membership of schengen means you remove your borders - i.e. 
  people can enter your country without showing passport/id .
