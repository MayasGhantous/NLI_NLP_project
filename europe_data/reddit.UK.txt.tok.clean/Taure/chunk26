  we never opted out from the entire charter , just title iv of the charter . 
  that 's what blair etc all said we had an opt-out from . 
  further , it 's not a full opt-out . 
  we 're still signatories of the charter , it 's just that the rights are non-justiciable . 
   if sigmar gabriel and the negotiators are really so convinced of the benefits of ttip , why do n't they just make the text available to everyone online ? 
  this seems to be the fundamental point of disagreement i have with the anti-ttip crowd . 
  the deal is not yet negotiated . 
  it 's common practice in international negotiations - indeed any negotiation - not to distribute draft agreements which are subject to change . 
  there are good reasons for this : it can negatively affect your negotiating strength , it can create false expectations , it can undermine your authority as negotiator . 
  and since none of it is agreed , it 's also pointless . 
  there 's no utility in seeing something that is subject to change , because any opinion you reach about it must be equally subject to change . 
  i 'm neither pro-ttip or anti-ttip . 
  at this stage , no one who is reasonable should be either . 
  ttip does not yet exist . 
  when the agreement is finalised , it will be published , and at that time we can all come to an opinion about it . 
  i just do n't understand the desire of certain sections of society to come to a premature opinion on it . 
  it reeks of bad faith : they 're keen to disagree with it so they look for any reason to do so . 
  and as for democracy , well , a democracy has such a thing as separation of powers . 
  it is not undemocratic to deny the legislature executive powers . 
  i 'm pro-eu ... the only way i would vote to leave is if someone like this got his hands on the eu . 
  the eu already has worrying tendencies to stifle innovation and growth in the name of `` consumer protection '' , often just an excuse to punish american businesses for doing better than european ones . 
  but in the long run protectionist measures will damage european business just as much as they hurt the successful american businesses that the eu is trying to undermine . 
   the uk will want more opt-outs and special treatment in the future . 
  people like to invoke `` opt-outs ! '', 
  like a kind of magic spell from harry potter , as if the mere word were enough to demonstrate british intransigence , but let 's consider each in turn . 
  euro opt-out . 
  only exists because we made a good faith attempt to join the euro and it completely crashed our economy . 
  we did n't start with the aim of opting out , it 's just that the euro proved impossible for the uk to join . 
  schengen agreement . 
  originally not even an eu agreement , but rather an extra-eu agreement that was later incorporated into the eu legal framework . 
  the uk joining would be pointless anyway as the large body of water between us and the continent makes seamless border crossing impossible . 
  further , the uk is able to fulfil all eu requirements regarding freedom of movement without being a party to the agreement . 
  title iv of the eu charter of fundamental rights . 
  the uk has signed up for all the parts of the charter that cover rights as traditionally understood . 
  title iv essentially amounts to a socialist manifesto and as such goes way beyond the eu 's normal area of competence . 
  it does n't just make rights , it effectively dictates national policy on a number of areas that in turn require national taxation . 
  the eu is traditionally unable to levy any kind of direct tax without unanimity . 
  cap rebate . 
  not really an opt-out but brought up often . 
  the cap is an eu system created almost entirely to benefit france . 
  it is n't really a legitimate use of the eu 's powers which are supposed to be used to benefit european aims not national ones . 
  since it is a policy created out of national interest , an opt-out made out of national interest seems only just . 
  area of freedom , security and justice . 
  goes way beyond the eu 's competency as the regulator of a single market and economic union . 
  not a core part of the eu 's mission by any measure . 
  and let 's not forget that the uk is far from the only country to opt-out . 
  when the eu was expanded to eastern europe , the uk , ireland and sweden were the only member states not to negotiate opt-outs from the freedom of movement . 
  further , germany is the only eu member state that maintains that its own national law has priority over eu law . 
  that 's a pretty major opt-out , even if it does n't appear on any list of opt-outs . 
  the point is that when you add more people , you increase the demand for goods and services . 
  population growth increases both the supply of labour and the demand for labour . 
  the size of the transfers do n't really compare . 
  fiscal transfers in the us are the equivalent of the eu funding greece 's national debt , no questions asked , no strings attached . 
  and that 's just one state . 
  the us has multiple greeces , all of which the federal government funds . 
  you do n't have to take him as an authority . 
  anyone who has read even a small amount about economics will know for themselves that what he says in that clip is true . 
  well , india did n't use a model of export led growth and the head of its central bank has made several speeches about how the period of export led growth is now at an end ( basically because there is n't enough demand in the world to allow any more countries to get rich by increasing supply ) . 
  let 's say you have two countries , each of which makes the same two products . 
  we 'll call these two countries itaaly and coloombia . 
  and we 'll call the products hookers and blow . 
  each country needs the following number of hours to produce each good . 
  ** itaaly ** blow : 90 hours hookers 80 hours ** coloombia ** blow : 100 hours hookers : 120 hours as you can see , itaaly had an absolute advantage in both products , in that it can produce each product for less . 
  if each country just consumes that which it produces domestically , then itaaly needs to spend 170 hours working to afford one of each product , whereas coloombia needs 220 hours . 
  now let 's imagine what happens if they specialise . 
  itaaly is more efficient at producing hookers than blow . 
  coloombia is more efficient at producing blow than hookers . 
  so let 's imagine each country just produces that which it is best at . 
  itaaly spends 160 hours producing two hookers . 
  coloombia spends 200 hours producing two batches of blow . 
  now let 's say they trade their surplus products so that they have one hooker and one batch of blow each . 
  they now have the same as they would have had as if they had produced the goods domestically , only itaaly has worked 10 hours less and coloombia has worked 20 hours less to get it . 
  so by specialising in that which they are best at and trading for what they lack , both countries gain : they get the same for less ( or , from another angle , if you keep the amount of work fixed , then they get more for the same amount of work ) . 
  so even where one country has an advantage over another country in every area , it still profits them to specialise in that which they do best and import what they lack . 
  countries do n't get rich by low skilled , low wage labour outsourced to them from rich countries . 
  it can lead to a certain amount of growth but it has an ultimate ceiling . 
  this is why china is now trying to reorient their economy towards greater domestic consumption . 
  to be truly rich ( at a per capita level ) , china needs to do more than just manufacture the west 's products . 
  basically everything i know about the history of the eu is from the first section ( 7 chapters ) of european union law by chalmers , davies and monti . 
  it 's a relatively expensive book and not really appropriate to buy unless you 're interested in eu law , but if you have access to a university library it would be worth taking a look . 
  it 's one of two standard textbooks on eu law so it 's likely they 'd have it . 
  for keeping up to date with current developments , politico.eu is great . 
  the majority of people are n't making national economic policy . 
  at that level the idea of money , debt , credit etc all becomes increasing abstract and bears little relation to anything a household deals with . 
  many people try to understand national economic policy through an analogy to household finance . 
  this is an error . 
  varoufakis delivered a great slap-down to this effect : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yznwdcesn90, 
   a higher amount of money is used to buy the same amount of goods , so the price goes up sooner or later . 
  except like you said above , we have n't seen any inflation . 
  this is largely because qe invests in financial assets to increase liquidity rather than giving money directly to `` the people '' to act as demand stimulus . 
   yeah serioisly it feels like economic policy has been completely divorced from the world of common sense . 
  not sure why you would think common sense has much to tell you about proper economic policy . 
  yup . 
  but a natural birth can tear the tissue separating the vagina and anus . 
  it 's an understandable decision xd, 
   when it 's already got a declining population and record low unemployment that 's precisely what it should be doing . 
   instead i come here to read comments from germans telling me that they see no difference between romania and egypt . 
  if that 's the fucking case then why do we have a free-trade and free movement of people with you ? 
  if there is no difference in your minds then i want out so i can impose import tax like egypt . 
  a single market is not a promise to make giant fiscal transfers .
