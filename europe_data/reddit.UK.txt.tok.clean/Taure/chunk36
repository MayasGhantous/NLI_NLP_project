  the british people are quite capable of disliking the eu but voting to remain a part of it as the lesser of two evils . 
  that 's certainly my position . 
  we saw it with the scottish independence referendum , and we 'll see it again with the eu referendum : in the face of uncertainty , especially financial uncertainty , brits vote for the status quo . 
   ** osborne seeks two-tier europe enshrined in law **  george osborne , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , will on tuesday set out for the first time the uk 's demands for eu treaty change to protect its economy , taxpayers and the city of london in a two-speed europe . 
   after months of diplomatic shadow boxing , mr osborne will use a speech in berlin to set out in detail how britain wants a new eu settlement to enshrine the rights of non-eurozone countries in the 28-member club . 
   in exchange for these protections , mr osborne will signal that britain will not stand in the way if the 19-member eurozone decides to press ahead with closer integration . 
   `` quite frankly , the british people do not want to be part of an ever closer union , '' the chancellor will tell a business audience . 
  `` i believe it is this that is the cause of some of the strains between britain and our european partners . ''  mr osborne will call for `` principles embedded in eu law and binding on eu institutions '' to govern a two-tier europe , with an integrated eurozone surrounded by a looser group of countries using their own currencies . 
   his speech represents the moment when britain 's eu renegotiation gets serious , as david cameron 's government forces the pace ahead of a crucial summit in brussels next month . 
   speaking at the annual conference of the bdi business group in berlin , mr osborne will set out for the first time a list of specific demands britain wants addressed before it holds a referendum on leaving the eu . 
   mr osborne will say that the new rules must enshrine the `` integrity of the european single market '' and ensure that it is not distorted by eurozone countries rigging the rules in their favour . 
   the treaty changes would include `` the recognition that the eu has more than one currency and we should not discriminate against any business on the basis of the currency [ area ] in which they reside '' . 
   that clause is specifically aimed at protecting british financial groups from protectionist measures by the eurozone , and to ensure that london will retain its position as the principal centre for european finance . 
   mr osborne will add : `` we must never let taxpayers in countries that are not in the euro bear the cost for supporting countries in the eurozone . ''  the proposals could be enshrined in a postdated treaty -- to be wrapped into the eu treaties at a date after the british referendum -- although other european countries are certain to ask what they will receive in return . 
   mr osborne 's response is that once britain 's position in the eu single market is protected , london will then stand aside and allow other eurozone countries to press ahead with closer economic and financial integration . 
   other european capitals will seek reassurance that mr osborne 's plan does not represent special treatment for britain or -- particularly -- for the city of london . 
  britain is also seeking an `` emergency brake '' mechanism to protect the economic interests of non-euro countries , a proposal revealed last week by the financial times . 
  well , it 's already been determined from the distribution of the wreckage that it disintegrated in the air , not when it hit the ground . 
  and the altitude of the plane is also known , and is high enough that it was out of the range of the type of ground-to-air rockets that militia in the area possess . 
  that really limits the possibilities . 
  that 's not the line . 
  he said britain does not want an `` ever closer union '' . 
  there 's a big difference between the two . 
  in many ways , britain does want a closer union - it 's britain that 's campaigning hardest for european capital markets union , for example . 
  what britain is against is an eu that considers itself on a kind of predestined path towards federal statehood . 
  well , the money part is broadly true xd, 
  we generally do it at formal balls , galas , races , that sort of thing . 
  society events . 
  you 'll always be introduced by a mutual acquaintance . 
  it 's considered rude to go up to someone you do n't know and introduce yourself . 
  very forward . 
  so a mutual acquaintance will play matchmaker and introduce two people he knows . 
  the woman will curtsey to the man and the man will kiss her hand and then they will dance for a bit , if it 's a ball , or go on a walk together , or exchange witticisms at the dinner table . 
  then the woman will go home and sigh to herself and say `` oh mr darcy '' while thinking about all his money . 
  janan ganesh is as british as anyone . 
  that 's not the same thing though - it 's the difference between agnosticism and atheism . 
  i 'm saying the eu is free to determine its own form by political negotiation and compromise involving all member states and democratic mechanisms . 
  it has no predetermined end state , but that does n't mean it ca n't change in the future . 
  just that any such change is the result of future political negotiations , not some kind of natural road for the eu to follow . 
  barring the possibility of future change goes a step further than what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm pretty sure he was making a joke :p, 
  that 's some pretty dodgy reasoning . 
  a people is not the same as a state , and there are many forms of union other than federations . 
  and denmark and sweden . 
  `` ever closer union '' can be interpreted in many different ways . 
  it can refer to a union of peoples in increased solidarity , not political union . 
  this is something of a [ myth ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-13-984_en.htm ) : http://europa.eu/rapid/exploit/2013/10/ip/en/i13_984.eni/pictures/100000000000061200000361d79132cb.jpg the uk complies with eu law more than france and to the same level as germany . 
  the uk has a different vision for the eu than some other eu member states , but that 's completely legitimate . 
  the eu has no natural destination or nature . 
  further integration is not predetermined or preordained . 
  plus , if you want to talk about `` preferential-ism '' , let 's talk about the cap . 
  agreed . 
  but ideally he would be deported rather than flayed . 
  ** if this is perfidy , it works for britain ** janan ganesh * nothing has brought out the uk 's talent for half measures like the european project * meant to wound , `` perfidious albion '' sometimes feels like a backhanded compliment . 
  the world can see that britain has done well out of its reluctance to commit to anything . 
  it never fell for socialism , fascism or any absolute belief system . 
  its empire outgrew others by putting material interests over a mission to spread britishness , whatever that is . 
  the malleable constitution , the tepid anglicanism : these are the raw materials of an envied stability . 
  nothing has brought out britain 's talent for half measures like the european project . 
  we were absent at the creation , then we joined , then we voted on whether to leave , then we conceived the single market , then we dodged the single currency , then we pushed the eu 's borders to the east and complained about the consequences , and now we are trying to revise the terms of our membership before voting again on whether to leave . 
  this is perfidy , and it works . 
  britain is a richer , more liberal economy than it was in 1973 , when it entered the european economic community . 
  this can only mean that europe has been good for the country -- or not so bad as to hold it back in a serious way . 
  there is no third possibility . 
  at some point , it will dawn on eurosceptics who talk up the success of modern britain that they are inadvertently making the case for the status quo . 
  and it will dawn on zealots for integration that britain 's commitment-phobia , maddening as it must be for them , has saved it from continental follies . 
  we have our own currency and , for the most part , our own labour laws . 
  britain 's economic performance of late owes something to these freedoms . 
  they were negotiated by governments that , at the time , were patronised for their lack of european vision . 
  vision is the enemy . 
  for half a century britain has been muddling through and for half a century its interests have been served tolerably well . 
  both sides of the debate expect too much from the coming referendum . 
  it will not be an existential or even a very historic event . 
  it will not `` settle '' anything . 
  if we vote to leave , we will not really leave . 
  a bargain will be brokered that preserves some british access to the european market in exchange for some duty to observe european laws -- a version of the swiss and norwegian compromises . 
  over time , this diminished form of membership will start thickening out again as exporters ask for access to new sectors of the single market and regulations are borne as the price . 
  meanwhile , european court of justice rulings on britain 's status will pile up , and they will tend to bind us in to the club making it harder for us to stand apart . 
  one day , we will wake up and realise we have something tantamount to eu membership . 
  then we will get on with our lives . 
  even the leavers deny that a vote for them is necessarily a vote for total exit . 
  some cite the norwegian and swiss examples favourably . 
  if that is their opening position , you can imagine the watery mush it will turn into over the course of the campaign . 
  and if we vote to stay , we will never become a truly european nation anyway . 
  even if david cameron achieves the square root of nought in his renegotiation of membership , britain is already estranged from the eu core by its currency . 
  this will not change under his or any conceivable premiership , especially if the eurozone integrates into something resembling a state for the sake of its own survival . 
  at that point , britain would have but one purpose in the eu : to prevent laws applicable to all members being decided by the currency bloc , especially those affecting our financial services sector . 
  the remainers should not overstate their case : a vote to stay is a vote for decades of loveless , defensive diplomacy on europe 's sidelines . 
  if that is the burden that comes with participation in the world 's largest single market , voters will grudgingly live with it . 
  there is no clean answer to the conundrum of britain and europe . 
  because the referendum pits true-believing europeans , who think the question is something as airy as `` what kind of country should britain be ? '' , against fervent sceptics , who see 1973 as a historic wrong to be avenged , nobody makes the case for fudge . 
  but fudge works . 
  fudge is the british way . 
  fudge is how britain ended up with the best but not the worst of the european project . 
  and fudge is what will emerge at the end of mr cameron 's great democratic exercise , whenever it comes and whatever the official result . 
  the referendum is not a fork in the road . 
  it is a roundabout with no exits . 
  i think this would be a doomed project from the start . 
  the more integrated group would inevitably use their greater power to disadvantage the lesser integrated group so as to enrich themselves . 
  this is exactly why cameron is seeking protections for the uk 's financial sector as part of the renegotiation - the eurozone has already made several attempts at passing legislation to force business out of london and into the eurozone , and this would only increase with further ez integration .
