  fuck you farage . 
  it would be endlessly hilarious if the uk voted to remain and france voted to leave a few years later . 
  the uk does not have a national id system . 
  i quite liked the fish in newspaper one . 
  but yeah the rest was kinda random . 
  while i do believe brexit will lead to capital flight , this is n't it . 
  https://next.ft.com/content/f26cd946-2cd5-11e6-bf8d-26294ad519fc  ** capital is not fleeing britain because of brexit **  chris giles  7 june 2016  the words `` capital flight '' legitimately strike fear into people , officials and governments . 
  if people are rushing for the exit , banks collapse , the currency plunges and legitimate business can cease as everyone does the rational thing and joins the queue . 
   there is no doubt that brexit risks capital flight from the uk . 
  sky news on tuesday said it had uncovered evidence that `` investors are shifting billions of pounds out of british assets in light of the eu referendum '' . 
  the evidence came from the an obscure part of the bank of england 's monthly banking statistics , which showed almost # 60bn in `` external and foreign currency flows '' in march . 
   the remain camp immediately jumped on the statistics like flies landing on excrement . 
  george osborne , chancellor , put out a press statement , saying : `` financial markets are telling us what all the evidence shows : that britain will be permanently poorer if we vote to leave the eu and the single market . 
  there will be less investment in britain and that means fewer jobs and lower living standards . 
  if we vote to leave , what we are seeing now is just a taste of things to come . ''  while mr osborne 's last statement about market turmoil in the event of a brexit vote is likely to be true , the evidence to date for rampant capital flight from britain or its banks is feeble . 
  one problem is that the data creating all the excitement are volatile . 
  the # 60bn decline in march was not repeated in april ( a # 6bn decline ) , so it is more a blip than a gathering storm . 
   more importantly , other equally obscure boe data from the same release sheds light on what is really going on . 
  in tables showing the activities of british banks outside normal deposit-taking and lending , in march there was a # 60bn fall in sterling liabilities and a # 42bn rise in foreign currency liabilities . 
   in other words , the apparently large flows mostly reflected the clients of british banks taking out insurance against a large drop in sterling . 
   there was no overall drop in deposits in uk banks in march , but a # 10bn rise . 
  if capital was fleeing the uk , we would see the opposite , as we did in greece last year . 
  people appear to be happy with money in british banks , but do n't necessarily want as much exposure to sterling at a volatile time . 
   so , there is nothing much to worry about yet . 
  i say `` yet '' because capital flight is a risk after a vote to leave . 
  i hope you realise what you 've done .

   no evidence ? 
  when 's the last time a mass groping like this occurred ? 
  that is not evidence . 
  it 's anecdote . 
  what the media chooses to report and not report is rarely guided by statistical significance . 
  but for what it 's worth , there is an increasing body of evidence that large numbers of sexual assaults occur at music festivals and other similar events , and have done for some time .

  evidence would be a statistical study that was conducted with scientific rigour i.e. 
  attempting to isolate different causes . 
  for example , poverty is commonly a major factor in criminality and refugees are generally poor . 
  so you would expect a higher rate of criminality in refugees than in the general population because of that . 
  but that does n't mean that being a refugee or being a muslim makes you more likely to commit crime . 
  it just reinforces the well established point that poverty leads to higher crime rates . 
  so a rigorous scientific study would attempt to isolate the effects of poverty . 
  that is far from the only factor you would need to isolate to prove that it was islam and not something else that was causing a higher rate of criminality . 
  ultimately the best study would probably be one comparing crime rates of muslim and non-muslim refugees from similar regions and ethnicities . 
  that 's because you 've learnt american english . 
  in british english it 's more common to use `` middle-eastern '' ( or `` arab '' , often incorrectly ) for people from the middle-east , `` asian '' for people from south asia , and `` oriental '' for china . 
  people generally have no clue what they 're talking about here . 
  merkel did nothing to allow more refugees into europe . 
  what she did was allow more refugees who were * already in europe * into germany by suspending the dublin regulation in germany ( which states that refugees must seek asylum in the first safe country they reach ) . 
  the point is that if a statement is true or reasonable , it remains so regardless who is making it . 
  logic does not depend on the identity of the speaker . 
  the fact that you considered the identity of the speaker relevant shows that it was you , not me , who wished to `` deflect '' the discussion away from the substantive point and towards an empty rhetorical point . 
  the substantive point is this : in any population there are criminals . 
  there are plenty of rapists and sexual assaults among the native uk population . 
  one would expect this to be the same in the population of migrants also . 
  it would be extraordinarily strange if there were no criminals amongst the migrants . 
  but : a. i have seen no evidence that there is a higher rate of criminality among migrants than among natives of comparable socio-economic status . 
  in any case , the vast majority of migrants are not criminals while still being muslim . 
  c. given these , it 's hard to justify any argument that says that islam is the sufficient cause of criminality . 
  if islam were the sufficient cause , then every muslim should be committing crimes . 
  since they are not , we must conclude that being a muslim is in itself insufficient to make a person commit criminal acts . 
  other factors must also be present . 
  it seems to expose your bias more than mine that you considered that question worth asking . 
   a lot of islam has a problem with integrating into western culture that does n't seem to be the take-away message here . 
  europe has accepted hundreds of thousands of migrants and the vast majority of them are following our laws . 
  but i guess `` 400,000 migrants do n't do anything wrong '' is n't really newsworthy compared to `` 100 migrants are terrible people '' . 
  london gets bashed a lot on reddit . 
  great to see something positive about it . 
  from the eu guide to errors in english-use :  ** anglo-saxon **  * explanation *  in english , the term ` anglo-saxon ' is generally used to describe ` a member of any of the west germanic tribes ( angles , saxons , and jutes ) that settled in britain from the 5th century ad ' . 
  also , particularly in america , it is used to denominate white people , usually of the protestant faith ( ` wasps ' ) , thus excluding large swathes of the population of that country . 
  it follows that there is no such thing as an anglo-saxon country , or , as in the example below , an anglo-saxon agency or anglo-saxon capitalism . 
  furthermore , the anglo-saxon language ceased to exist in the 12th century ( i am ill-informed about brussels , but the last known speaker in luxembourg was st willibrord , 658-73919 ) . 
  this term is particularly inapplicable ( and , i gather , irritating for those concerned ) when used to describe the irish , scots and welsh , who partly base their national identities on not being anglo-saxons , and verges on the ridiculous when used to include west indians . 
   * example *  ` the anglo-saxon group of agencies reflect ( sic ) the previous dominance of anglo-saxon capitalism which was not disrupted by two world wars and the specific operational issues relating to asian economies . '  * alternatives *  ` english-speaking ' when referring to the countries or the people , ` british ' and ` american ' ( ` australian ' or whatever ) when referring to agencies , capitalism etc. 
  the term may , however , be used if you are talking about something like the ( presumed ) ` anglo-saxon conspiracy ' and you will often find it used ironically in this way in the british press ( usually in inverted commas ) . 
  however , it has negative connotations and should be avoided . 
   we 're talking direct systemic violence towards anyone who will ever try do you have any evidence for this ? 
  the substance of your point stands regardless . 
  a sharia court can only have effect by virtue of a contract which states that disputes will be heard by a sharia tribunal . 
  any contract made with someone under 18 is voidable and therefore so is the tribunal 's authority . 
  the problem is n't the law , the problem is monitoring so that the legal rights which already exist are being enforced . 
  which is already the case . 
  all arbitration decisions can be appealed to the courts for `` serious irregularity '' under the arbitration act . 
  a decision contrary to the equality act and the human rights act would be unlawful and therefore certainly a serious irregularity . 
  the legal framework is already in place to prevent the abuse of sharia tribunals . 
  the problem which needs fixing is the lack of awareness of that legal framework . 
  i imagine the vast majority of women who receive an adverse decision in a sharia tribunal think to consult a solicitor . 
  fyi , on the terminology front , mediation is technically not the same thing as arbitration . 
  an arbitrator makes a binding decision whereas a mediator merely assists settlement talks . 
  all arbitration decisions can be appealed to the court system , so if the arbitrator came to a decision that was in conflict with uk law then the courts would strike it down . 
  in which case it 's fortunate that all arbitration decisions can be appealed to the court system if there 's a serious irregularity including a breach of the equality act or the human rights act , both of which ban discrimination .
