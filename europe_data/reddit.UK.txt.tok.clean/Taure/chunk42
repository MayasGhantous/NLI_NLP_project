  they 're two sides of the same coin : in both of them , one party is suggesting that it can retain all of its benefits without taking on any responsibilities . 
   if the uk owe 40 billions to the eu and decide to just not pay , all your assets around the world will be seized and you will be declared persona non-grata in all institutions ( wto , imf , nato ) and wo n't be able to do any business with anyone and nobody will lend you any money . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  the uk does not owe 40 or 60 billion euros to the eu in the sense of normal debt . 
  there are no issued financial instruments for the uk to default on . 
  the uk is part of an international project and have made commitments to that project which are conditional on our continued membership . 
  a uk that has exited the eu refusing to pay the eu is not an event of default any more than the united states would be considered in default if the eu suddenly declared that they owed them money . 
  unless a government has issued a financial instrument acknowledging their debt under the law of contract , that government owes money to no one . 
  like i say , the legal basis for those are the eu treaties , which the uk can leave unilaterally at any time ( being a sovereign state ) . 
  if the eu wants the uk to do otherwise , it has to offer something . 
  saying that the uk 's obligations to the eu survive exit is just as absurd as the claim that the uk would continue to have eu rights after exit . 
  the only benefits and obligations that survive are those that are negotiated to do so . 
  budget obligations are obligations that arise out of the eu treaties . 
  if you leave the treaty and the union , you no longer have any obligations , just as you no longer have any benefits . 
  the eu can ask the uk for as much money as it likes , but it would be no different from asking any other non-eu state for money . 
  there 's no legal basis for it . 
  if the eu wants 60 billion euros from the uk and compliance with various rules besides , it is going to have to offer something in exchange . 
  the eu position on this is just as laughable as johnson 's `` have my cake and eat it '' position . 
   production , surely ? 
  gdp measures production . 
  gdp measures total production , or total income , or total expenditures , which come out the same . 
   for me germany and austria are clearly central european countries . 
  portugal on the other hand is the westermost european country ... `` western europe '' is typically used with socio-economic meaning as well as geographical . 
   i 'm from the netherlands , and a reputable in-house public television pollster found last year that 48 % of people here favour leaving the european union entirely , so it does n't really compute that we 'd be so trusting of the european union and its motives . 
  there are many reasons other than trust which contribute to the desire to remain an eu member . 
  otherwise greece would have left already . 
  the belief that you are more prosperous in the eu than outside it , for example , does not really require any significant trust of eu institutions or politicians . 
  merely a belief in free trade . 
  monarchs are still around for the same reason we do n't knock down the tower of london to make room for offices : national heritage . 
   when pesticides and fertilizers have to be ` natural ' , it mainly means that they are less effective and need to be used more . 
  they also lack specificity so end up killing a load of `` innocent '' wildlife as well . 
  just another example of greek economic mismanagement / s, 
   cartograms just look terrible i raise you these : http://imgur.com/a/eyz8u, 
  hdi is n't very good at distinguishing between advanced economies though . 
  once you reach a certain level of political stability/safety/public health/education , it really is what stuff you can buy which determines any further increases in your quality of life . 
  you can , however , inherit intellectual property :p, 
  the other problem is that manufacturing is an industry particularly apt for automation ( even more than it already is ) and so relying on it as a source of employment is not a great idea and only going to get worse . 
  title says `` detained by navy '' , article refers to `` naval authorities '' . 
  yet not one mention anywhere of * which navy * performed this action . 
  what a shitshow of an article . 
  it 's not about the cities ' economic strength in general ( which would be measured by gdp ) bur rather the extent to which the global economy depends on them . 
  that is mostly a matter of business and professional services including banking and finance , because it 's a measure of those industries which facilitate the operation of others around the globe . 
   our current agreement is essentially being ripped up , and , unless we 're going to join one of the pre-existing agreements ( eea or efta ) , we will have start discussing all things from scratch , because we 're forming a third-country trade deal with the eu . 
  this was the uk proposal that the eu rejected . 
  the eu does not want to treat the uk as a third country negotiating from scratch . 
  the whole justification for the `` exit bill '' is that it 's impossible to just pretend that the uk is the same as any other third country . 
  i 'm not sure why one would judge by ceta . 
  there 's an obvious disanaology between the uk and canada : the uk will be going from a position of greater market access to less , whereas canada was going from less market access to more . 
  that means that in the uk 's case you just have to selectively cancel previous standards and keep the ones in place that you still want . 
  it 's not obsolete because of the prevalence of asymmetrical warfare , it 's obsolete because beyond-visual-range combat is the norm in modern air warfare . 
   beside allies , who can take down eurofighter ? 
  russia , china , anyone who buys their planes , plus anyone with a ground-to-air missile . 
   it can go to bombing missions without fear of being taken down . 
  there 's a reason why the tornado not the eurofighter is currently deployed in syria and iraq . 
  the eurofighter is not a bomber , it is an air superiority fighter . 
  it is currently undergoing upgrades to enable it to have better air-to-ground capabilities but this is far from complete ( and also , as far as i 'm aware , a unilateral british project , not something that is being introduced across the whole eurofighter range ) . 
   does it really need stealth technology which is already probably obsolete ? 
  yes . 
  stealth technology is not meant to make you invisible , it 's about avoiding good missile lock for as long as possible . 
  the trick is to have your enemy in the range of your weapons before you 're in their range . 
  if you have to dogfight , you 're doing it wrong . 
  current stealth technologies on e.g. 
  f-22 and f-35 are very good at that . 
  or , you know , build a plane that people want to buy rather than one built for a type of combat that is mostly obsolete ( dogfighting ) . 
  more like gordon brown selling the uk 's gold at the bottom of the market . 
  the timing of the eu referendum coincided with a time of ongoing european economic malaise and a migrant crisis . 
  both those are now passing . 
  this is why fundamental changes to constitutions should not be based on one-off referenda . 
  people end up making long term decisions based on transitory factors . 
  neither , just trying to get people to appreciate the ways it resembles a tax more than a loan . 
  do n't think of it as a loan , think of it as a 30 year 9 % tax on income over # 21,000 . 
  the vast majority of people will have their debt forgiven before they repay so that 's what it amounts to . 
  ** how britain and france 's economies match up ** * the two economies are more similar than partisans of the frogs and les rosbifs may think * emmanuel macron and theresa may may be preparing to take their countries down very different paths , but on one issue they sound remarkably similar . 
  both the passionately pro-european french president and the prime minister intent on the uk 's exit from the eu have doubled down on their economic claims -- or , to be precise , the same economic claim . 
  `` today we are the fifth economic power in the world , '' mr macron proclaimed in a presidential debate last month . 
  that may be news to mrs may , who boasted in last month 's conservative manifesto that '' we are already the fifth-largest economy in the world '' . 
  who is right , mrs may or mr macron ? 
  as the two countries go to the polls this week -- with the uk general election on thursday and the first-round vote for france 's national assembly on sunday -- how do their economies compare in terms of performance and prospects ? 
  and who should be cheering : the frogs or les rosbifs ? 
  ** economic might ** when the likes of mr macron and mrs may lay claim to the fifth position in the global league table of economic power , they are talking about gross domestic product measured at current exchange rates . 
  http://i.imgur.com/dloicvj.png for 40 years , france and britain have been very close on this measure . 
  which country leads on this count is usually determined not by fundamentals but by fluctuations in the strength of the pound against the euro or franc ( before 1999 ) . 
  on the basis of the latest international monetary fund forecast for 2017 , britain is marginally ahead , but a 1.5 per cent fall in sterling -- less than the slide over the past month -- would reverse the positions . 
  this measure of gdp is not a good representation of how much economies produce ; economists and international organisations prefer to compare economies at an exchange rate based on what money in each country can buy . 
  on such a basis , known as purchasing power parity , or ppp , the uk again comes out slightly ahead , by 2.5 per cent , but both britain and france are overtaken by india , russia , indonesia and brazil , putting them in ninth and tenth places respectively . 
  ** living standards ** people 's living standards are measured not by total gdp but by gdp per head which , given the similar size of the british and french populations , is also very close ( at ppp exchange rates ) at $ 42,481 in the uk and $ 42,314 in france last year , according to the imf . 
  the oecd has compiled a more illuminating measure that concentrates on how much people actually have to spend . 
  this suggests france is very much in the lead on living standards , with average household disposable income in 2013 of $ 29,759 , compared with britain at $ 26,687 . 
  http://i.imgur.com/fpn9uyl.png since inequality in britain is significantly higher than in france , most people 's living standards will be higher in france than the uk , but the richest people are likely to be better off in britain . 
  ** labour markets ** britain likes to think of the french labour market as sclerotic , weighed down by rules such as a 35-hour week and restrictions on firing . 
  there is little doubt that greater uk labour market flexibility has produced higher employment . 
  according to oecd figures , the uk 's employment rate of 73.7 per cent at the end of 2016 compared with france 's level of only 64.1 per cent . 
  http://i.imgur.com/tx7zwna.png unemployment is also considerably lower in the uk than in france . 
  the latest comparable eurostat figures show the jobless rate at 4.4 per cent in the uk , against 9.5 per cent in france . 
  ** productivity ** how many people are employed matters for economic performance . 
  but their productivity is just as important . 
  http://i.imgur.com/vma4thx.png the output produced by an average french worker is much higher than that of a british worker . 
  in fact , a typical french person needs to work only monday to thursday to produce as much as a british person who is working monday to friday . 
  ** foreign direct investment ** britain likes to boast that , as the conservative manifesto put it , the uk is `` the biggest recipient of foreign investment in europe '' -- supposedly an indicator of the strength of the economy . 
  http://i.imgur.com/grdfx2t.png according to the oecd 's latest authoritative figures , mrs may 's party need not have confined their claim to europe .
