  the uk was the world 's favourite location for foreign investment in the fourth quarter of 2016 . 
  but , as the oecd also noted , fdi is a measure of money flows , not foreign companies moving to a location and building a factory or setting up an office . 
  the uk 's strong position in 2016 was heavily influenced by the $ 100bn anheuser-busch inbev acquisition of sabmiller late in 2016 and other purchases of uk-based companies in the wake of the brexit vote . 
  some such acquisitions were prompted by the fall in the pound , which lowered the price of british assets to foreigners . 
  the uk is not always ahead on measures of fdi , but that has been the norm in recent years . 
  ** industrial structure ** the conventional wisdom is that france and britain have very different economies , with france dominated by agriculture and industry and britain 's post-industrial economy much more reliant on services . 
  http://i.imgur.com/yy4tn4i.png but the similarities between the two countries dwarf the differences . 
  in both cases , the services sector produces nearly 80 per cent of output -- the highest level in the oecd ( apart from tiny luxembourg ) . 
  these days neither britain nor france secures much of its income from agriculture , forestry or fishing . 
  still , the finance sector is more important for the uk economy , representing 7 per cent of output against 4 per cent in france . 
  conversely , the sector made up by public administration , health and education is bigger in france , at 23 per cent compared with 18 per cent in the uk . 
  ** recent performance ** in the past decade , france had a shallower recession and a slower recovery than the uk . 
  since the peak of the previous boom at the start of 2008 , the uk economy has performed better , growing 3.6 per cent more in total . 
  but this difference is small . 
  http://i.imgur.com/xuuy0g3.png real wages have grown faster in france and the uk 's performance is flattered by rapid population growth . 
  with higher unemployment , france has more potential to maintain its recovery than has the uk . 
   i 'm not sold that it requires more police funding to arrest someone on `` jihadi next door '' if they did in fact admit to something illegal there . 
  the point is that they have n't done anything illegal yet so you ca n't just arrest them . 
  you need police resources to monitor them to prevent an attack if they do indeed end up planning one . 
   this is what some of us have been saying for ages . 
   most here would down-vote since nato was all that was needed . 
  the joined-up procurement point is an obvious one ... until one gets into the nitty gritty of any such cooperation . 
  the problem is of course that military spending is also big business . 
  every eu member state wants to protect its own military-industrial infrastructure . 
  any unified procurement strategy would have winners and losers at the national level and would amount to significant fiscal transfers . 
   this coming from the country that has never done anything for nato the usa * is * nato . 
  the whole of europe combined could n't even project as much power as a single one of the usa 's ten carrier groups . 
  in a week where it emerged that the uk police had intelligence on a potential terrorist but lacked the resources to act on the reports , thus failing to avert a terrorist attack , it 's rather strange to see a lack of police resources endorsed through this colour scheme . 
  you have a very strange approach to the idea of wealth . 
  nothing really has any kind of intrinsic value . 
  the universe does n't care about your shoes and games . 
  the only place to look for the origin of wealth is humanity ourselves : if people want something , it is valuable . 
  if you have lots of valuable things , you 're wealthy . 
  there 's no fundamental difference between the value of a machine that makes shoes , the value of the financing of that machine that allows you to buy it , or the value of the insurance that means the risk of buying the machine is low enough to make it worth it . 
  they 're all things shoe-makers want , and thus they have value by virtue of the fact that they are in demand . 
  it is n't , but an excessive surplus can indicate a lack of strength of demand/consumption in your domestic economy , which makes your economic performance extremely reliant on exports . 
  it can also signify that you 're under-investing in the domestic economy/hoarding too much currency as savings . 
  remember that ultimately money is a medium of exchange to acquire goods and services . 
  it 's the means by which we as society organise labour . 
  sitting on large amounts of savings may sound like a good idea from the individual standpoint , but it 's actually quite inefficient if it 's excessive at the national level . 
  it represents labour failing to be utilised , potential investment that is not being made . 
  just think about it in terms of what is actually happening : germans are spending all their time making valuable goods and sending them away from germany . 
  in exchange they receive numbers in their bank accounts which they keep there rather than using to acquire goods and services for themselves . 
  who 's the real winner in that equation ? 
  there 's also the fact that within the eu it can lead to large imbalances due to there being a monetary union without fiscal transfers . 
   with us out , europe can finally crack on with the military and economic integration we brits have been blocking for decades . 
  even massive federalists like juncker have acknowledged that the people of europe in general have no appetite for `` more europe '' right now . 
  i do n't think anyone is contesting the accepted historical fact that the uk 's naval supremacy was what protected it . 
  capitalism is not synonymous with fiscal restraint . 
  no links as such to hand , but `` inflation is responsible for worst effects of the bengal famine '' is a theory that was proposed by the famous indian economist amartya sen , so if you google him you should find his works on that topic . 
  of course the british , as the ruling power , still hold ultimate responsibility for their failure to address the effects of that inflation . 
  it 's just a more sophisticated analysis of the way in which the british are responsible . 
  well , it 's a bit more complex than that . 
  for example , during the irish potato famine , the uk government spent approximately # 11 billion ( adjusted for inflation ) on importing food from the usa to feed ireland . 
  similarly , during the bengal famine , although the british continued to export food from india , there still remained more than enough food in india to feed everyone . 
  the problem was distribution : each indian state was hoarding their food and the raj was unable or unwilling to force them to share . 
  so very little of the surplus made it to bengal . 
  that was combined with inflation that meant that even though food was available , the poor could not afford it . 
   borrowing too much because they were spending too much alternatively , they were borrowing too much because they were n't taxing enough ( or more to the point , not receiving the taxes they were owed ) . 
  my problem with the question is that i feel that `` moral '' and `` not immoral '' are not the same . 
  i would say that i am completely indifferent to both homosexual and heterosexual behaviour : i do n't think they 're wrong ( they 're not immoral ) , but nor do i think they 're virtuous ( they 're not moral ) . 
  i do n't have any interest in making moral judgments about the sex lives of other people . 
  so i put 3 . 
  it 's not that * i 'm * amoral . 
  it 's that consensual sexual behaviour is amoral . 
  do n't understand why we do n't do it ourselves : we 'd build up our nuclear expertise , we 'd keep the money in the uk economy , and we 'd likely build to a higher quality with respect to safety standards . 
  it 's called political geography for a reason . 
  you ca n't ignore the politics . 
  in which case , he should have said le tour eiffel , not `` the '' . 
  this is false at least for chile . 
  chile holds a strict position of neutrality . 
  all government documents have to have dual reference : the islands are referred to as `` falklands/malvinas '' . 
  on top of that chile has a close relationship with the uk that would , i think , tip them in uk favour if it came to it . 
  back during the falklands war , chile allowed uk to use their radar systems . 
  the only time uk ships were sunk was when those systems were down for maintenance . 
  every language has its difficult parts . 
  spanish has a rather precise vocabulary that can be hard to get the hang of ( ser vs. estar , por vs. para ) , and some difficult grammar ( subjunctive , reflexives ) . 
  on the other hand , the pronunciation is easy . 
  norwegian is the reverse ( for someone who speaks english as their first language ) . 
  the grammar is super-simple and extremely similar to english . 
  but the pronunciation is really difficult . 
  norwegian is actually a two toned language . 
  i 'm not entirely sure how relevant what they 're called in portuguese is to what they 're called in english . 
  this sounds a lot more expensive than the current costs of illegal immigrants . 
  a cure worse than the disease . 
  okay , politics and law nerds . 
  this is your hour . 
  you 've been given the chance to rewrite the eu constitution from scratch . 
  how will you arrange things ? 
  reminder : please keep it realistic . 
  you have to try to keep people happy . 
  no renaming the eu the roman empire and reopening the colosseum . 
  my own attempt in the comments . 
  you can assume that they will take the message seriously . 
  everyone talks as if a default is tantamount to grexit , but i do n't see how it is that one directly and necessarily leads to the other . 
  economists/political scientists , please chip in . 
  and let 's not forget the prequels focusing on greece 's accession to the euro ... no doubt to include a trade dispute . 
  one major argument for further eu federalisation , or even a `` united states of europe '' ( use ) , is that a unified europe would have greater `` global clout '' . 
  i myself have used this argument many times , and each time it has been met with people nodding along as if i 'm saying something substantial . 
  i confess , i always feel the guilt of intellectual dishonesty when i use this argument .
