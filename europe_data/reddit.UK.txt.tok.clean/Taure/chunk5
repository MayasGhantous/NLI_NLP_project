  people are so used to converting currency without a second thought that it 's easy to forget that the currency has to come from somewhere , and when you 're talking billions of dollars , this can be a major problem . 
  in the past , russia has had a supply of dollars coming into the country from their exports of oil , on which the entire russian economy is dependent . 
  with the dramatic crash in the price of oil , russia suddenly has a lot fewer dollars entering the country that before . 
  this has been compounded by persistent and significant devaluation of the russia rouble which make dollars more expensive to buy on international currency exchange markets . 
  as a result of these factors , russia has been gouging its foreign exchange reserves to pay their debt . 
  russia 's reserves have [ fallen ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11328974/russia-faces-perfect-storm-as-reserves-vanish-and-derivates-flash-default-warnings.html ) from $ 511bn at the start of 2014 to $ 388bn at the start of 2015 , and they 've kept falling since january . 
  when those reserves run out , russia is going to have severe problems paying their debts . 
  we did come up with our own name for the country . 
  it 's `` holland '' . 
  apparently we 're not allowed to use it , so i think it 's up to the person forbidding its use to create a suitable replacement . 
  two answers that i have found unsatisfactory in the past : ** military power ** the argument goes that a unified european military would be significantly more powerful than the current eu militaries , plural . 
  there is no doubt some truth in this . 
  a unified european military would benefit from significant economies of scale that individual european nations lack . 
  the number of ships , fighter jets etc. 
  a nation buys is often dictated by price per unit , and the more you buy of a single unit , the lower the price per unit . 
  if all europe was buying a single air superiority fighter , a single destroyer , a single frigate , then the price per unit would drop . 
  further , development costs would be dramatically cut as britain , france , and germany would n't be separately investing in the development of redundant technologies . 
  all these savings would mean more `` bang per buck '' . 
  however , the use of `` military power '' as an answer to the question of clout is a problem , for several reasons : - it 's not clear by what mechanism a larger , more powerful military makes a nation more prosperous . 
  what would a use with a powerful military be doing in the world right now , that the eu is not , which would make europeans richer ? 
  - a powerful military only leads to greater `` global clout '' if its capabilities are matched by a will to act . 
  given the diverse and strong views within europe about the appropriate use of military force ( consider iraq ) , and even the possession of nuclear weapons , it 's not clear if a more powerful european military would actually yield any actions . 
  in short , it 's easy to get carried away with the financial savings of unification and underestimate the practical problems of running a single military of a federal state with strong regional asymmetries . 
  - more bang per buck only goes so far in making your military more powerful . 
  eventually you do actually have to spend the money , and europe 's defence spending is incredibly low . 
  it 's unlikely that in practice the savings would be used to expand europe 's military . 
  the more likely result of lower unit costs would simply be reductions in military budgets to maintain the same forces with less money . 
  ** bargaining power ** this argument goes that a use would have the ability to use its `` global clout '' to achieve better terms for europe in international treaties and international commercial agreements . 
  the example often used is that it would prevent the russians from turning off the gas . 
  there are some problems with this : - it 's not at all clear what a use has in collective bargaining than the eu lacks . 
  the eu already negotiates a unified position via the european commission , so it 's not like the current situation is diplomatic chaos . 
  - it 's not clear by what mechanism this `` increased clout '' works . 
  why , exactly , is russia not going to turn off the gas on a use , if it would on the eu ? 
  if it 's the threat of military force , see the above , especially europe 's significant reluctance to use military power , and the obvious problem of the russian nuclear deterrent . 
  if it 's the threat of economic sanctions , what economic sanctions could the use put on russia that the eu ca n't ( or has n't ) ? 
  from the latin germania . 
  you guys are going to have to come up with a shorter , less awkward name than `` the netherlands '' if you want people to stop calling you holland :p, 
  to be fair , it 's common to refer to places by using the name of a small but significant place within that area . 
  germany is often referred to simply as `` berlin '' . 
  a parent 's obligation to their child is ongoing , not a one-time decision . 
  a man can walk away from a pregnant woman and only be abandoning a foetus , sure , but no one pays child maintenance to a foetus . 
  once the child is born , both parents have an obligation to support it . 
  there is no way to discharge yourself of that responsibility , neither for the mother or the father . 
  it does n't matter that the baby was a foetus at the time the father walked away , because his obligation continues all the way up to age 18 . 
  saying the father abandons the child does not assume that the foetus is a child . 
  once the child is born , it 's definitely a child , and neither the father nor the mother can abandon it . 
  the definition of the foetus is irrelevant . 
  it 's the born child that the father is abandoning , not the foetus . 
  if the child is n't born , then the issue does n't arise . 
   i do n't think the eu can be currently described as a federation . 
  there is no single army or unified foreign policy . 
  those are n't necessary conditions of being a federation . 
  fifa is a federation . 
  hell , they 're not even necessary conditions of being a nation state : costa rica does n't have an army at all ; the national guards of the usa are under state command . 
  the eu is a group of separate entities which have come together and formed a group with its own leadership and rules , in which the individual members sacrifice some of their independence in favour of the collective authority . 
  that 's a federation . 
  regardless , none of this matters . 
  the question clearly thinks the eu is a federation , because it says `` further develop '' . 
  so it does n't really matter whether we think the eu is a federation , since the question implies it is . 
   as for the majority , it is a clear majority of those who would vote in a referendum at this time . 
  it would have been a plurality if the `` no opinion '' people also voted for `` no opinion '' in the referendum . 
  but that is usually not offered as an alternative on the ballot paper . 
  firstly , the idea that the `` no opinion '' people would n't vote is n't very realistic . 
  secondly , arbitrarily restricting the sample so that you can describe a non-majority as a majority is the worst kind of statistical manipulation . 
   and the question is `` further develop into a federation of nation states '' , which clearly means that a federal europe is the end result . 
  i disagree . 
  the eu is already a federation of member states , as exhibited by the word `` further '' . 
  the question simply asks if you would be in favour of any further integration . 
   it is a significant majority of those in favour over those who oppose it that 's not what the word `` majority '' means . 
  there is a majority in favour in 7 member states , and a ** plurality ** in favour in a further 11 . 
  the idea of `` financial abortion '' is absurd . 
  there is no legal right for parents to abandon their children . 
  not only is it massively open to abuse -- there 's nothing to stop men who ** do ** want kids waiving the right and getting the best of both worlds , by getting a kid but no financial responsibility -- it 's also sexist . 
  a woman can not financially abort a kid . 
  she is by default responsible for taking care of it if the man disappears . 
  further , the policy would result in child poverty on a massive scale . 
  abortion is n't a legal right that one has . 
  it 's a medical procedure that one can elect to have . 
  parents do not have a legal right to abandon their children , and that 's not what abortion is . 
  a woman can choose to have an abortion not because she has a legal right to abandon her kids , but because she has a legal right to have medical procedures done to her body . 
  the equivalent male right is not a right to abandon his kid , but a right to have medical procedures done to his body . 
  which he can have . 
  it just wo n't do anything about the pregnancy . 
  not mentioned : how every other country in the world did exactly the same thing . 
  that does n't follow . 
  yes , each individual should use contraception if they do n't want a kid . 
  but if they do end up having a kid , the use or non-use of contraception is now irrelevant to your rights . 
  wearing a condom is a practical way to safeguard yourself , not some kind of legal defence . 
  the fact of the matter is that a foetus is a part of the woman 's body , no different to her kidney or liver . 
  if a woman wants to donate her kidney , a man ca n't stop her from doing so and make her keep it . 
  if she does n't want to donate her kidney , a man ca n't compel her to do so . 
  it 's her body . 
  imagine a german president of europe slapping high taxes on financial transactions and using the money to subsidise car manufacturing . 
  it 's only `` us '' so long as it 's something positive that people want to claim ownership of . 
  discuss invading iraq and suddenly it 's `` them '' again . 
  what ? 
  only 7 states out of 28 have a majority in favour of more federalisation . 
  also the question is vague . 
  it says `` further develop '' , implying simply going further down the federalisation path the eu is already on . 
  it does n't say `` become a united states of europe '' , which is what everyone seems to interpret the results of approving .
