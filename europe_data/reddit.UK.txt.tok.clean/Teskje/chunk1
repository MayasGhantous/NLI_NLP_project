i was born and live in england , but i 'm in love with norway . 
  it 's my future home if y' all will accept me \u2764, 
  a lot of brits have irish grandparents/great grand parents so we get a lot of irish influence in our culture . 
  it 's definitely celebrated by a lot of people here in the uk, 
  not sure . 
  it has been heavily americanised , so is in the mainstream of all western cultures . 
  i celebrate it just because my grandparents are irish and they celebrate it . 
  also , it 's another excuse to have a good time . 
  * if you insist ... *, 
  haha , you 've got that right !, 
  only 7 cups ? 
  he 'll get there eventually . 
  wow . 
  strange to see how my city looked back in 1927 . 
  very interesting .

  the moment we have been waiting for ... 
  i 'm very aware . 
  however that 's the only explanation i can offer . 
  i wonder how turkey would react if greece did to turkey what turkey did to russia . 
  could it be the city of london and then normal london ? 
  john le carr\u00e9 with a hint of george orwell, 
  i hope it does n't either . 
  but honestly it 's already begun , hopefully it does n't escalate in a `` race to the bottom '' . 
  i think trading under wto rules is probably the realistic scenario here . 
  now castile ara gone . 
  * everyone loses * ** putin intensifies **, 
  `` when we are among the 27 [ countries within the eu , not including the uk ] , the hardliners are more numerous than it appears . 
  i can not quote a country in particular at the moment . 
  we will see it at the beginning of the negotiation , '' giro said in an interview with the guardian . 
  he added : `` we are hearing more and more that there are people -- economic interests -- who are thinking they can inherit some economic position , thinking that they can take away from the uk some of the position of the city of london . 
  not italy , of course , because we are not in that position . 
  and this will be an economic war . 
  let 's say an economic cold war , and we are not in favour of it . '' the statement followed remarks this month by the british prime minister , theresa may , in which she said the uk was prepared for a `` hard brexit '' if she could not negotiate a reasonable agreement with the eu over britain 's departure . 
  she said attempts by other eu countries to wreak vengeance on the uk would be an `` act of calamitous self-harm '' because the uk in turn would be prepared to radically cut taxes to attract businesses . 
  that is disgusting . 
  of course everyone has different opinions . 
  but for the majority of british people and certainly for the majority of the government people do n't want the eu to fall or fail . 
  they just do n't want to be a member of it . 
  why does n't ireland have any data ? 
  not wanting to be a member of a political/economic union is quite different than wanting it to fall . 
  * `` about 900,000 british citizens are living in other european union countries -- fewer than the previous widely quoted estimate of 1.2 million , according to research by the office of national statistics . 
  '' * 900,000 brits is still a hell of a lot . 
  the uk government and british people do n't want the eu to fall . 
  well , no prime minister is elected , that 's not how the government works . 
  they 're appointed by the queen ( and she basically appoints the winning party 's leader , but hypothetically she could appoint anyone ) cameron was n't elected either . 
  that 's not the problem . 
  the problem is just may pushing brexit through illegitimate means, 
  if the supreme court ruled the other way it would totally undermine our parliamentary sovereignty . 
  i fully expect parliament to vote in favour of brexit . 
  absolutely , this is a great thing . 
  theresa may is not a dictator , she must respect the system we have in place and parliament must vote . 
  i honestly very much doubt that parliament will vote against brexit , and if they do , i think there will be very violent and severe consequences . 
  the vote to leave was n't legally binding , though . 
  so they potentially could go against the will of the people . 
  good . 
  you got me, 
  me too , united we stand , divided we fall . 
  people apply this to the uk , i wish they applied it to the eu , but oh well : /, 
  fortunately ( or unfortunately ) i do n't think we 're going to get brexception . 
  scotland is unlikely to leave the uk and orkney is extremely unlikely to leave scotland . 
  yeah , true . 
  maybe because i live in england , but i thought these issues were way behind us in the past . 
  it 's not something anyone wants to ressurect , hopefully this case of terrorism remains isolated and the northern irish can live in peace . 
  or niall , not sure his name . 
  haha , love that the uk has 1d and ireland just has liam, 
  * continues, 
  `` this attack on the life of an officer is a stark reminder of the determination on the part of terrorists to murder and maim police officers . 
  `` they believe that by causing great grief to a family they are somehow advancing their warped and outdated plan . 
  the wider community will be outraged by this attack on one of their police officers . 
  `` the police serve the entire community and wounding one individual is an attack on the entire community . '', 
  * `` the attack comes as northern ireland prepares for fresh elections after the collapse of powersharing . 
  so , the united states , australia and nz want free trade deals with the uk . 
  how long do we think these will these take to negotiate ? 
  please stop embarrassing your fellow countrymen , thanks . 
  why is business in france so difficult ? 
  i also blame the brits . . oh wait :(, 
  r/vexillology will like this, 
  conspiracy theorists are gon na have a field day, 
  i do n't doubt it . 
  article 50 will be triggered in march , then it will take two years to leave . 
  nope . 
  the headline of the article is now `` theresa may indicates uk will leave single market '' . 
  when i posted this story it was `` theresa may says uk will leave the eu single market '' . 
  not sure how i can prove it , but i 'm willing to bet there is a redditor who could ( please do ) . 
   and / u/teskje altered the headline of the ft article to suit the narrative as well ... even ft says `` indicates uk will leave '' . 
  it 's open to interpretation but in no way shape or form did she confirm or essentially confirm anything ( typical may style ) actually , i copied and pasted the headline of the article when i posted it , it has since been changed . 
  i 'm not trying to suit any narrative ... 
  article 50 will be triggered in march . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm quite anxious about the whole thing . 
  hopefully brexit can be positive for both the uk and eu nations , but i 'm pretty sure only negative things will come from this ( at least for the uk ) . 
  one thing i find concerning is that many people voted for brexit with the expectation that the uk would have access to the single market . 
  this whole thing is just one big mess . 
  screenshots of the article : https://imgur.com/gallery/rijef, 
  i 'm sure that 'd be perceived positively . 
  nobody believes her to be bluffing ... 
  i wanted to remain , but i 'm somewhat optimistic for a post-brexit britain . 
  i 'm half nervous and half excited to see how things will progress for both the uk and eu . 
  out of curiosity , what part of the uk are you from ?
