this guy was only 3 shades less dodgy than berlusconi, 
  if scotland does n't separate from the shambles of uk government more fool them . 
  i just went through the first page of your post history and feel there is little point discussing with you . 
  sorry , cya later, 
  yeah they 're such a vicious problem the average homicide rate across europe is 4 times lower than america . 
  read that wiki page again . 
  63 percent non-hispanic white or european american 196,817,552 63.7 % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_united_states, 
  lolz  in this book , steyn argues that `` much of what we loosely call the western world will not survive the twenty-first century , and much of it will effectively disappear within our lifetimes , including many if not most european countries . 
  '' [ 2 ] the declining populations in european countries coupled with both the increasingly high birth rates of muslim countries and the increased muslim immigration into european nations will , according to steyn , lead to the end of modern european culture . 
  meanwhile by 2050 over a third of the us will be hispanic and blacks will be the majority demographic . 
  no offence but that book sounds like some redneck motherfucker who does n't appear to be aware that even `` multi cultural '' countries like the uk are still 91 percent ethnically white british whilst the us is only 60 percent so not only is he a fear mongering racist he 's also wrong . 
  the biggest upheaval of culture in the 21st century will appear in north america not europe . 
  and even then it wo n't be a particularly bad cultural upheaval for n.america - it 'll just be more south american influenced . 
  edit : sorry gentlemen i forgot we were just here for the wank circle . 
  carry on . 
  how are they successful ? 
  their current strategy is a hail to industry and corporate worship . 
  their current economic success is at odds with stagnant german wages and rising german poverty . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/07/germany-not-profiting-eurozone-export-boom meanwhile the us treasury criticised german export policy in exporting poverty to the southern eu states . 
  no one is winning from their economic strategy except big business . 
  well my government started withdrawing their passports and drone striking them in syria, 
  . . or they 'll collect money me or you wo n't see in a lifetime for virtual cows on facebook, 
  there 's a german market that comes to my city every year and every december we spend most weekends watching this old german guy with an impressive moustache sing us english/italian/german christmas songs whilst playing the accordion to a dodgy back track whilst drinking some mulled wine or mulled cider or german wheat beer and eating a wurst hotdog . 
  feelsgoodman, 
  once a gyppo , always a gyppo, 
  our economy is supposedly doing well http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/food-poverty-in-uk-has-reached-level-of-public-health-emergency-warn-experts-8981051.html, 
  ah fair point . 
  bloody americanisation, 
  they 'll be saying that when we run austerity through them so hard they 'll dream of days in the soviet union, 
  the ability to sell natural resources to china and/or america, 
  i do n't even live in england anymore and i 'm about as patriotic as ... something not very patriotic . 
  i really could care less where the uk comes, 
  lol no you 're wrong . 
  those islands are self governed and independant of the uk in everything but tradition . 
  what 's funny is for the uk to change the crown 's dependancies laws we 'd have to usurp or coup their democratically elected government which frankly is a weird proposition from an irishman, 
  you mean the islands that have their own devolved government and are n't part of the uk by any meaningful form beyond military protection ? 
  or the eu could publish consistent tax laws across all nation states . . 
  preach brother they are trying to put a certain amount of import on whether its an americans rights have been violated and if not - fuck them, 
  ... because its the most deregulated , tax free evasive state in the world !, 
  * wash your questionably routed money through our banks and not pay a penny in tax !, 
  when drone technology is sophisticated enough they wo n't even need a manned army that will ever have to leave the united states borders . 
  then they 'll be able to shovel x factor down their fat stupid faces whilst men in new york commit genocide abroad as their day job with impunity . 
  i 'd agree if it was n't for the disgusting farming tactics america uses . 
  food inc is worth a watch, 
  the euro needs to be disbanded as an utter failure, 
  you might want to paint it like that but that 's not the whole picture . 
  our farmers would not be able to compete with gestation cell 'd pigs or corn fed cows . 
  it 'd likely put our farmers out of business and swamp our markets with shit . 
  there 's a reason beef and lamb in the states and canada is labelled `` grass fed '' and priced at a premium, 
  well yeah i hope so . 
  i hope this deal falls flat on its arse . 
  but those gestation cells are one point of contention in an example of many . 
  the fact american farmers can use a practice outlawed by the eu means guess which pork ends up being the cheapest in our supermarkets ? 
  the one created from ( moral ethics aside ) the cheapest means possible obviously this point is one of many issues that will result in what godzilla185 described as super markets `` being flooded with garbage '' . 
  i love it when they refer to `` non-americans '' in their news when referencing torture or drone strikes and by love it i actually mean it makes me want to grip every living american by the lapels and vomit into their face, 
  lol the us still allows gestation cells for pigs which were outlawed in the eu years ago, 
  because we remained divided . 
  we did n't federalise into a united states of europe and as a result the us has been able to pick us apart at each turn, 
  ah he 's right oceania was actually the americas , british isles and australasia europe became eurasia merging with russia https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/1984_fictitious_world_map_v2_quad.svg, 
   what happened to the press in the uk ? 
  the bar to journalism used to be school drop outs that showed themselves as decent journalists . 
  as time has gone on - to even get into the industry you needed a degree and to be able to work as an intern for a significant amount of time ( a year ) . 
  now that bar is in place guess what sort of people can afford to get into journalism ? 
  guess what sort of people are completely priced out of entering journalism ? 
  all the heads of the current bbc very likely went to same university as a significant amount of politicans oxford uni https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord_patten_of_barnes oxford uni https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tony_hall,_baron_hall_of_birkenhead oxford uni https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danny_cohen_%28television_executive%29 cambridge uni https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_harding_%28journalist%29 was in government but now director for bbc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_purnell cambridge uni , was in government but now a non-executive director for the bbc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiona_reynolds tl : dr the bbc is nothing but a mouth piece of public relations for the government and do n't think for a second they do n't have an agenda . 
  got to give another nod to that orwell guy who predicted the eventual nation state of * oceania * forming from northern america and western europe which the tpp basically does . 
  this `` free trade '' deal ( another nod to orwells `` doublethink '' and `` newspeak '' as it 's not even a free trade deal . 
  in fact it 's the opposite and is basically protectionism for big corporations . 
  this is a free trade deal in the same way the `` patriot act '' affords americans more civil rights or the way the `` war on terror '' can be concluded in any tangible fashion ) will be the worst thing to happen to both americans and europeans . 
   this mechanism could threaten almost any means by which governments might seek to defend their citizens or protect the natural world . 
  already it is being used by mining companies to sue governments trying to keep them out of protected areas ; by banks fighting financial regulation ; by a nuclear company contesting germany 's decision to switch off atomic power . 
  after a big political fight we 've now been promised plain packaging for cigarettes . 
  but it could be nixed by an offshore arbitration panel . 
  the tobacco company philip morris is currently suing australia through the same mechanism in another treaty . 
  canada did the same and is currently sat on the un human rights watch list, 
  do n't trust them - we 're all using european operating systems on home servers for file sharing  ( debian/opensuse ), 
  either it does n't happen and that 's good or it does and politics in my country swings violently to the right, 
  he 's implying immigration from romania and bulgaria is a non issue . 
  given the fact polish migrants have been an issue of social contention where poland is looked upon as either good or indifferent i assure you this will be a massive point of contention and social unrest for the right who think all romanians travel by horse and cart and steal blonde children, 
  and what ? 
  well if you need me to spell it : out the door to poland opened at a time when the uk was doing very well economically and brits have been reasonably hostile to eastern europeans if you kept an idea on tabloid headlines or popular opinion during that time . 
  the doors are opening again on the back of 5 years of austerity , an economy being inflated by a housing bubble which has seen houses and rent rise to [ astronomical levels as well inflation year on year ] ( http://www.rateinflation.com/inflation-rate/uk-historical-inflation-rate ) for [ 5 years in an economy where people have n't seen pay rises since 2008 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/18/hidden-poor-years-without-pay-rises ) , where graduates are dancing in interviews for a job at currys and [ where the rise of zero hour contracts \\ ( people with absolutely no job security \\ ) ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/apr/02/rise-staff-zero-hour-contracts ) has risen from 11 percent in 2002 to 23 percent in 2011 . 
  if the uk see 's levels of polish immigration in this economy our political balance will shift violently right, 
  perhaps so but then if what you say is true then / u/crusader _ pearson is still wrong, 
  sorry mate but our gov estimated 6k polish would come and 600,000 came in the first year . 
  not true . 
  my mate had to wear one for a fraud conviction . 
  no way most people i know love france and dream of a house in the south, 
   there are two different types of unemployment benefits . 
  unemployment benefit 1 is available for people who have been working in germany for the last 12 months at the same job . 
  you will have to register for this benefit no less than 3 months before finishing your job . 
  ha , germany do n't allow migrants to claim unless they 've worked at least a year, 
  yeah but your world reknown is zero . 
  when anybody talks about the us outside of the us they talk about california and new york and are aware enough to have heard of texas and know to avoid it, 
  i agree . 
  not sure what you 're getting at ? 
  very true but accents and languages are more unique and obvious identifiers as to which social cultural clique you are currently in . 
  lol my friend - i think you 'll find that is literally the definition of culture my friend . 
   the ideas , customs , and social behaviour of a particular people or society : and if you follow the logical arguement by having a more diverse cultures in shorter km squared you indeed have more diversity you 're back at proving my point, 
  lol - well they 'd be speaking welsh in wales with welsh road signs and generally a lot of their reading material in welsh .
