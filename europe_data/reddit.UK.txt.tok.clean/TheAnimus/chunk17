  the thai police did n't give two shits , i 've no idea what happened as i promptly ran away very fast , they claimed to not find anyone there . 
  but that 's a good example of when you do n't want someone to have a good weapon as i have , in this case it 's a very young teenager against a mid twenties guy who was double his height and weight . 
  what i am meaning is the mugger has the upper hand . 
  they choose the moment of attack . 
  if you allow me to have a better weapon , odds are you allow them to have a better one . 
  in a civilised first world society , i think relying on any citizen to use force is not a good idea . 
  i also worry that improving access to such weapons will benefit those who have nefarious intents , rather than the honest people . 
  ie guns in america . 
   this is simply intellectually dishonest , sometimes its useful and sometimes it is n't its as simple as that . 
  sure what 's the data for this ? 
  iirc most thefts in london are distraction/pickpocket thefts . 
  so a weapon is not going to help . 
  so we 're on to the small number that use threat of force . 
  my argument which i 'm not sure where the data would come from , is that in a threat of force situation the idea that people would be calm , rational and prepared enough to use a weapon is the minority . 
  we do know the best advice is to simply give up whatever they ask for , rather this is what the met tell you to do . 
   which voids the need for tools . 
  its simply not true and i 'm bored of the argument framed in such a way . 
  that 's not what i am saying at all , i 'm saying that an improved tool will also be used by the mugger , who is the one is the advantageous position , as they are the one choosing the confrontation . 
  i 'm not some pacifist , i was a member of a gun club when i was in the states and i enjoy pistol shooting , hell i spent 4 figures on that hobby . 
  i 'm aware of how weapons can be a force equaliser . 
  i just ca n't invision a situation were it would be of better benefit to ** me ** than the ** premeditated aggressor ** . 
  i 'd be really interested on good data on the matter if you have anything . 
  otherwise it 's only my personal experiences ( anecdotes ) that shape my views . 
  the thing is the spray costs little to be used , so in the case of this friend he was ` ambushed ' sprayed in the face before he knew what happened he 'd had his bag stolen and his phone / wallet removed from his pockets as he was kicked to the pavement . 
  violent muggings are quite common in some parts of thailand sadly . 
  the few bucks for a spray is worth it for the faster mugging . 
  in the uk it 's far more common that someone threatens with a knife , rather than stabs you outright . 
  if someone threatens you with a knife , it 's unlikely you 'll have chance to pull out a cs spray , remove the safety tab , think which way the wind is and use it correctly without getting stabbed . 
  if someone pulls out a cs spray on you , odds are it 's ready to go , so you ca n't pull out yours and deploy it properly in time . 
  so i see lower cost sprays as only helping those doing the muggings . 
  i guess for rape and such it might be different , but i 've never experienced any of those , so ca n't comment . 
  hell i rather stupidly prevented a knife mugging by clubbing the small child with my camera as he ordered me to remove it from my person , it was in a position of height above him and i 'm strong enough to try to crack his skull , this is not what should happen . 
  if someone tries to mug you , they are going to win , unless you are really prepared which is unlikely and frankly a warzone style , not a world i want to live in . 
  i dunno , i like the fact it 's expensive and harder to get hold of here in london . 
  for instance i 'd rather be mugged by the threat of a knife than by someone coming unannounced spraying cs in my face which was how an acquaintance managed to lose an ipad in thailand . 
  the question is are safer with prohibition on such weapons , given that the only time i 've been successfully mugged ( well pick pocketed ) i was very drunk , so drunk , that i would have been unable to correctly use such spray , i kind of have to think yes , prohibition on weapons is a good thing . 
  are you saying my solution for every problem , exterminating the entire population of the planet is n't a perfect one ? 
  it solves the issue mentioned in the specification . 
  [ if we 've waited long enough to make jokes about it ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcrghe5p2ek ), 
  i dunno the fuckwits at my students union , even if somehow they found themselves granted emergency powers ruling germany would n't be able to manage to arrange a pissup in poland , let alone an invasion . 
  the blitzkrieg probably would n't happen due to concerns around pollution in the arden , instead they 'd storm the maginot line under the cover of daylight with giant foam jazz hands , because [ guns make loud noises ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32032291/students-swap-clapping-for-jazz-hands-at-nus-event ), 
  pfft guns work really well at preventing gun crime , at least that 's what my texan friend told me . 
  why not end sexisim by using sexisim . 
  all you need to do is kill all the males and the problem will be solved in a generation , no sexisim left . 
  wow they got a better photographer !, 
   why on earth do they want to go from norway to uk ? 
  because our food is better, 
  it 's a shame in the uk we 've lost some , the problem is the land you need for an airport is special , it needs to be flat , have a prevailing wind and not with a flight path over something bad ( towers , power stations , etc ) . 
  this is comparatively rare in the uk we 're not completely flat like nl , but we also have a bit of a problem , the planning regulations allow aerodromes to be turned into say housing or industrial estates with minimal effort compared to say farmland . 
  as a result you get companies that buy the aerodrome under the guise of it being an airport , run it into the ground and replace it with housing at great profit . 
  when you consider that say the ppp is about 3 times greater in finland than say serbia , you 've got to them remember that many people earn maybe 350eur a month before tax in some parts of the world . 
  scale that crudely up with that factor of difference in ppp and you 've got a very tempting reason . 
  let 's say that it 's the same as living in finland on 1000eur a month very roughly , so yeah that 's going to be a big temptation to someone . 
   they 're not supposed to but they can , but this was a one way street and a narrow one that ca n't fit both a car and a cyclist side by side sounds like a perfect time for the council to use some of their cycle route money and put up maybe one sign indicating a contraflow cycle path :(, 
  there are externalities of having homeless alcoholic beggars in your society too . 
  this is less about racism , and more about general pragmatism . 
  in london such begging crime is disproportionately carried out by a specific group of migrants . 
  [ this is a relatively unbiased fact check blog on such inflamatory topic ] ( http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-romanian-crimewave/18207 ) i do n't want an increase in crime on my doorstep , yes that 's selfish , but it 's how i and many other people feel . 
  i 'd rather we focus what limited resources we make available on our on domestic homeless which include a number of very vulnerable people as well as the * care in the community * cases . 
  so given the statistics , i am not in favour of completely unrestricted migration . 
  it 's also a difficult topic because for someone like me , who is a very wealthy highly educated type , i 've mixed only with the best and the brightest , my life has been greatly enriched . 
  meanwhile , at the other end of things we 've got people who are moving here to work illegally , below minimum let alone living wages . 
  this puts a large downwards pressure on wages , people living in crammed dormitory environments because sending back 300 eur a month is a good wage . 
  we do n't have a shortage of such labour in london , it 's exploitation pure and simple . 
   getting annoyed by sleeping beggars and everything :( i used to work in this firm that had an incredible ` office manager ' that title does n't do her justice . 
  whatever was needed , she made happen quickly and efficiently . 
  think graduate from one of the top universities , a polyglot who spoke a dozen languages . 
  the only bad thing about her was that she was into crossfit , and fucking let you know about this . 
  one of her duties involved opening up the office , this office is in mayfair , one of the most expensive parts of london . 
  an eastern european tramp had taken up residence near the service door , took umbrage at being woken from his slumber at 6:30 am and attacked her . 
  she speaks most slavic languages , tried to reason with him but no . 
  she understood the first insult he threw at her , it was n't pretty and then to be met with violence ... 
  this changed her , her spirit for trying new things in life , her outgoing personality became withdrawn . 
  the physical scars can heal quickly but those mental ones ran deep , for her the world changed that day . 
  but sure , it 's not a problem for you at all is it , so it should never be for anyone else . 
  [ let 's get it on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-ct_gks80 ), 
   since when did newspapers write articles on something so insubstantial ? 
  think how many news sources covered that video of the racist hateful rant . 
  that was clearly a nutter too . 
  newspapers cover nutters . 
  ah because no one who earns 300 eur a month in serbia would be at all upset at some of the recent ` issues ' regarding say refugees right ? 
  they would be nothing but sympathetic to the greek complaining that their pension has fallen to only twice what they earn ? 
  anyone who thinks like that is a brigadier ? 
  i do n't agree with a lot of their views but i think i get why they have them . 
  look for me immigration and most of the eu things have been great , really good . 
  in the last decade i 've had many friends and a couple of lovers that i would otherwise have not . 
  i 've met some incredibly smart individuals whom i 've had the privilege of working with . 
  the nature of my work means my wages are not depressed by the increase of labour , if anything it allows me to do more as i stand on the shoulders of these giants . 
  i have the money the opportunity to learn about their culture their heritage experience their food their drinks . 
  but if you think i would tell the cleaner who has just had their wage cut ( sole trader ! ), 
  and is earning about half the recommended london living wage that he should n't be upset for the increased competition that is putting downwards pressure on his earnings , that he is n't allowed to complain about free movement ? 
  of course not . 
  also in fairness to germany , they had swallowed the whole east germany too . 
  that was no small endeavor . 
  why is / r/uk so left wing then ? 
  it 's definitely become very hostile to any view that is n't * print more money , consequences never happen , everything is keynesian , read this nobel prize winning economists rant * lately . 
  i 'd say it 's quite simple , the uk has done quite well the last few years , unemployment has fallen . 
  we have n't had any real crisis that brings out the sort of strong right sentiment . 
  as a result the view of many people is why are n't we helping the more vulnerable people . 
  meanwhile , many in europe have had concerns such as greece 's scandalous accounting , significant problems with migration and so that will drive people to be more ` right ' wing in general .
