they were all mirror journalists ? 
  this looks pretty similar to mine , which is an unremarkable mid-sized english town too . 
  huh . 
  interesting, 
  unless i 'm missing something , there 's nothing about native speakers though . . so it would n't stop them having conversations in english . 
  the last native cornish speaker died about 250 years ago , though . 
  wish my parents would see that - ` you only got 65 % in that module ? 
  you need to work harder '  _ , 
  yeah , but it 's also full of londoners who sit arouns smoking drugs all day with the music blaring . 
  dear immigrants , please stop being hardcore religious conservatives or we will kick you out . 
  please make an effort to learn our language and make an effort to contribute to society or we will kick you out . 
  there , done . 
  banks are full of nice , white , european people with money and jobs . 
   i dont want another mass slaughter how about we just have this ? 
   you accuse everybody who is against islam to be like hitler [ citation fucking needed ], 
  http://puu.sh/jo0cl/4641d56d8d.png great , good to see you 're an actual neo-nazi . 
  oops , guess i 'm wrong . 
  time for krystallnacht round 2 then !, 
  i 've linked a whole bunch of articles i ripped straight off googling for ` why is diversity beneficial ' on the other side of this comment chain . 
  there is a downside to diversity , therefore diversity is never beneficial and is always bad . 
  great to see you 've made perfectly logical jumps here . 
  diversity ** is ** good . 
  diversity ** does ** have its downsides . 
  hitler was a pretty cool guy . 
  and then i suppose yes , i was dismissing his points because they are , for lack of a better word , incredibly close-minded . 
  okay then .

  and i did n't dismiss his argument , i just commented on it . 
  well then , it 's clearly because you 're a neonazi / s i 'm not denying that this sub is full of idiots insulting everyone who disagrees with their opinion , but there 's a lot of ` edit : why the downvotes ? ', 
  this sounds creepily like something hitler would say . 
  i 've seen plenty of people disagreeing with mass immigration and being treated as perfectly reasonable people . 
  the people who are treated as neo-nazis are doing a ** lot ** more than ` disagreeing ' with mass immigration . 
  the issue with so many people who are even slightly pro-immigration being treated as lefty scum is , imho , a bigger one . 
  12,200,000 french couples had sex in a castle and died ? 
  is n't that most of the population ? 
  mods are awake . 
   til migrants are guilty of any crime ftfy more . 
  both sides have valid reasons - whichever side has more valid reasons is personal viewpoint - but they 've used absolutely none of them . 
  i think everyone agrees with you , it 's just a very vocal minority ( i hope it 's a minority , at least ) who feel the need to use it to push a xenophobic or religion-fueled agenda . 
  then why are you talking about neonazis if you understand that far-right does not necessarily equates with neonazism ? 
  neonazis are racist . 
  racism is a symptom . 
  supposedly the only cause of racism worth mentioning is eu policy . 
  therefore , it 's likely neonazis are fueled , mostly , by eu policy . 
  this is stupid . 
   neo-nazis are maybe a couple of pourcent of any country 's population they are pretty much irrelevant politically . 
  even at 1 % that 's 100x , potentially more , than refugees - who are apparently super politically important . 
  i just give up - ` refugees who are different to us will never integrate and racism is caused by eu immigration policy ' is just plain dumb . 
  do you really not understand the concept of strawmanning ? 
  first it was ` different cultures lead to no integration ' and now it 's ` lots of people lead to no integration ' . 
   if you think far right people are all neonazis nobody mentioned ` all far-right people ' . 
  i said neo-nazis and solely neo-nazis . 
  fairly sure their racism is not caused by eu policy , and they probably share cause with a lot of other people with racist beliefs . 
   except i never said anything about getting rid of other races , did i ? 
  so all racism is caused by illegal immigrants ? 
  i 'm fairly sure ( just * fairly * sure , not like it 's totally sensible or anything ) we had racism before illegal immigration was a thing . 
   if a refugee is among thousands of his compatriots he will have the option to not give a fuck and just live exactly like he did at home , however backward it could be . 
  you 've now thrown a totally different point into the works . 
   cause of racism is for the most part the retarded lack of real european policy when it comes to illegal immigration . 
  yeah , sure . 
  i 'm absolutely sure the the neonazi idiots everywhere are campaigning for change in eu immigration policy . 
   how is stopping people illegally entering your country racism ? 
  your argument : if we just get rid of other races , we can stop racism !, 
  bit like saying ` we can stop homophobia by deporting the gays ' . 
  clearly the survey says something else . 
   people will get from their religion what they want and what they need . 
  people who are radical muslims would almost certainly be radical christians , hindus , buddhists , whatever if they were a different religion . 
  i do n't think that - even if certain dogma leans to a more bigoted view - it 's then fair to say ` well i do n't like you because your religion because it has bad people in ' . 
  which seems to be the common viewpoint . 
   the more they differ from us culturally , the less they are motivated to integrate bit of a jump there . 
  i can imagine someone 's willingness to integrate is a lot more dependent on what kind of person they are . 
  see : british expats in spain . 
   you can not just say `` racism is bad and we should fight it '' racism is bad and we should fight it . 
  does n't matter whether that 's fighting the cause or fighting racism itself . 
   the day european nations actually get together and agree on a plan to stop unchecked immigration and send back those that are not deemed compatible with our values will be the day racism figures start decreasing again . 
  they kind of are ... and if you mean ` the day we just build even bigger walls ' then of course racism figures will decrease , because that kind of racism will be considered normal . 
  the article has no data on that . 
  it just says 50 % of people chose not ` completely heterosexual ' . 
  fairly sure that the data in another article on the same survey shows it 's about 70-80 % either completely or strongly heterosexual . 
   first eu country planning to  these do n't work good to see there 's plenty of proof of this . 
  well , better go shoot them all then . 
   but i do have a problem with more orthodox , strict muslims . 
  so it 's not religion , it 's the people following that religion . 
  and i think most people would agree with that , but instead they decide that everyone of the same religion is the problem . 
  they 're middle class african male children coming to steal your jobs , steal your welfare , rape all the women and convert the country to islam and enact sharia law . 
  clearly, 
  claim they are everyone else 's problem , we 're better than them , and they do n't belong here because there are other countries they can go to . 
  do n't actually do anything about it though . 
  fine , you go draw muhammad and distribute it , i 'll tell isis where your house is , and then you can continue drawing him . 
  and ? 
   brittains for basically everything they have done in the last few hundred years ? 
  we did nothing wrong , it was everyone else who did stuff wrong . 
   what really needs to happen is a reform of the british welfare system not a renegotiation of the eu treaties . 
  you mean our country 's policy is most of the problem , not the eu ? 
  who would 've guessed !, 
  thanks . 
  i was under the impression they were - we should have limitations on free movement into the country , but no limitations on free movement out of the country and things . 
  i know , which is why i said tories . 
  primarily all this cherry-picking ( ` we want a better deal for britain which nobody else can have ' , e.g. 
  free movement , echr and whatnot ) and also the recent things like if the british public vote to stay in , they 'd force another referendum until we leave .
