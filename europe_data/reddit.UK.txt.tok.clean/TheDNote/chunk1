is n't vodka made with potatoes ? 
  might be the lack of vodka,

  a bit late, 
  or germany or france , you know those two thriving economic powers in the eurozone, 
  cold war, 
  i voted lib dems just because the greens are way to ... green , i do n't care if they do n't get any seats , as long as i got my say . 
  no ... the lib dems are like a slightly less green , green party . 
  i personnally voted lib dems in the eu because i looked through green policies and i saw `` anti nuclear '' and just said to myself `` well the lib dems are bassically a better green party now '', 
  are n't msot things these days automated ? 
  i bet someone is already coding this into their accounting software to declare things automatically for you . 
  the usa managed it . 
  albeit by a different path . 
  the new ukrainian government wants to be closer to the eu and inside the eu sphere of influence , therefore the eu `` must '' do something about these dastardly russians, 
  what an excellant idea, 
  i 'm saying that based upon the world health organisation rating, 
  if we look at the western european nations they do , the ones that do n't are places like romania , baltic states etc. 
  i see , well i think the fact he lives in the uk would skew his opinion about whether or not he 'd move out from his imagined `` home '' country to the uk . 
  just because he would does n't mean they would , imigration is good for the econamy upto a point , i highly doubt we are even close to this point , as far as i 'm concerned we should join with the schlegan area and be gone with all this bullshit about people comming here from europe to steal our jobs . 
  also only 500,000-ish immigrate into the uk every year out of which only around 70,000 are from the eu in fact we have more people comming from commonwealth countries than the eu , if anything should n't we block them from comming in ? 
  also can you guess the most common reason for people comming to the uk ? 
  it 's education , people are comming here and throwing money at us to educate them . 
  if it were such a problem then we would n't give a damn about the eu we would be looking elsewhere for the immigration issues .

  lib dem are the most federal and pro eu , maybe look at the green party ? 
  try this , check the candidates . 
  i 'm a bit confused , why to mainland countries require different policies than our island country ? 
  but will they ... will they really ... 
  are n't they using obama 's pr guy ? 
  and quite a few wish to stay including a majority of buissnesses . 
  whats the differance in policey between them and lib dems ? 
  '' bu ... but islands are different ! '', 
  i personnally dislike this anti-eu nonsense and will probably vote lib-dem just because they are the only pro-eu poeple out there except for green , and i 'm not sure on thier policies . 
  from authoritarian right to authoritarian left , your just as bad as the facists, 
  how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  2-3 hours a day how often do you visit / r/europe [ 2 ] ? 
  everyday , though rarely post . 
  what country are you normally resident in ? 
  united kingdom ( wales ) do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  german , very basic ( gf speaks to high level ) what interests you about europe ? 
  it 's buildings and history . 
  what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe [ 3 ] ? 
  i enjoy the cultural sharing and really enjoy all the images from cities and towns that gets posted , i also like that you 'll get a lot of different views on a news story . 
  not a huge fan of the prevalence of uk news being upvoted all the time nor the slight left leaning opinions , however that 's not really a problem with the subreddit and more with reddits comments section . 
  do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  i moderated a small forum for a mod called project reality . 
  why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  i enjoy power !!!!, 
  i actually just enjoy giving a helping hand when i can to something i enjoy . 
  why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  i enjoy helping people . 
  do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  i did an a-level in maths which included a statistics module and i 'm currently doing a chemistry degree ( 2nd year now ) so i will have a fairly good idea on how statistics works . 
  no idea about datamining and bots though . 
  what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  a megathread requires a lot of organisation but as mentioned in part 5 comments the thread is to broad of a topic to cover . 
  it should have been a mega thread that was used only to link to new stories and discussions regarding immgiration rather than a centre for disscussion . 
  is there a way to make comments on a thread approval only ? 
  or maybe stop people from commenting and update the thread when the stories come up . 
  i think the thread was good because it compiled information into one place . 
  what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i have university to concentrate on . 
  would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  a horse sized duck , ay least i could out manovre it and not get swarmed by 1000 bity horses . 
  what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why . 
  important , europe is an important union at least ecnomically and militarily , i love my cats and they are important to me , teachers are vital to the future of children and the world . 
  people die all the time . 
  if they werent on boats to begin with then they wouldnt die so easy, 
  yeah but if their competition does n't then it should even out, 
   that is not what idealized means . 
  the `` ideal '' version of something is vastly different than a cheap , misrepresented one made for mass public consumption i meant idealized in the eyes of the afd or people outside of their culture . 
   they are denying it is german . 
  its not hard to get really . 
  and i 'm saying it still looks german , it 's not hard to get really . 
   i 'd speak against it too . 
  fair enough but does n't mean it would n't look greek to me if that 's how i imagined greeks in the past looked . 
   it does n't mean we are progressive self-hating cultural marxists who hate the white race and its proud traditions , it is n't even political , its just an issue of dumb stereotyping . 
  did n't say that , i said you seem to refuse to accept cultural history or even if it is rather idealised cultural history , and that makes me think you are ashamed of it , because i ca n't see any other reason  not an attempt at an honest german cultural representation per fucking se yeah i know ... but it still looks german , denying it looks german is dumb . 
  hohoho , good one , i suppose everyone who isnt communist will just play along with this stateless situation . 
  `` guys this is how people view our culture , stop telling us how you see our culture '' `` yeah but this is how people think about your traditional culture '' `` yeah but its not how we actually are '' `` but thats still how we see it , and we think that looks german to us '' just makes me think your ashamed of the image, 
   the picture is bad because it has ** nothing ** to do with germans . 
  it 's how people view your culture and your recent-ish history and what people looked like pre-world wars and maybe a bit after down south . 
   if you take out the kid with the lederhosen it could be a generic western family . 
  did n't even notice the boy was wearing lederhosen and i thought they were german , especially the mans face , the dog and the girls pigtails , they look very german . 
  you may have this view of america because of the fair size of the german population that moved there and thus brought their culture with them , which was then reflected in advertising and american films and culture . 
   thats why its an effective caricature . 
  its not even german . 
  i would n't call it a caricature , the features are n't over exaggerated it 's not like say this : http://imgur.com/yasv0x2 or http://imgur.com/eflx23t it 's like saying heidi ( the cartoon ) is a caricature of german life , it 's not , it 's a stereotype if anything . 
   its shows generic conservatism , everything was better in the past ** crap ** . 
  maybe some things were better in the past , just because your being progressive does n't mean everything you do is right , i mean we only have to look at sweden to see how to much progressiveness in a short period of time is not healthy for society or a country . 
   its ** mindless backwardness ** condensed into a picture , with a generic `` its german '' sticker in the shape of lederhosen slapped on top of it . 
  it appeals to unreflected conservatives and the general desire for ** backwardness ** . 
  your implying that looking to the past for ideas of how to run a country is bad , just because we used to do sometihng and do n't currently does n't mean it was bad . 
  the romans used to have baths and sewer systems and aqueducts as well as much scientific progress which was abandoned fairly quickly in europe after the fall of the western empire , does that mean the pagans and great migrators that came after were somehow doing everything better just because they were further along a timeline ? 
  certainly not and ignoring potentially healthy life outlooks and views on life is an ignorant position to take , i suggest you embrace open mindedness like the old left used to . 
  since when did the left become scared of conservatives ? 
  was it when they started saying realistic things for once ?
