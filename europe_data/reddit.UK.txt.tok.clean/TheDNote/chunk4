  need to build up the salt reserves when the demand rises when brexit turns out better than expected, 
  this seems like a sensible proposition . 
  looks like he will win by a country mile , serbia joining the right wing rise in europe ? 
  or is this just a normal right winger ? 
  suppose the french liberated themselves . 
  face it , if the uk had not held out , the americans would n't have gotten involved in europe and we would have been ussr states . 
  the eu is not europe as much as many on here would like to say otherwise . 
  no need to counter an argument that 's so retarded i 'm not sure if it 's satire or not . 
  i think this is the most delusional comment i 've seen today , thanks for the giggle . 
  you are deluded, 
  good tourist spot me thinks , also a good cheeky beachhead to re-invade in 50 years * tips tophat *, 
  anyone want to short rbs with me in 2017/2018 ? 
  love this guy, 
  i think we need a great beautiful wall on our southern boarder, 
  that is a fair enough complaint , i 'm sure in the coming years labour and the lib dems will get their act together and be able to compete with the conservatives . 
  true but if scotland leaves ; england , wales and ni will have more revenue to spend on it 's own people , you can take scotland if you want to fund her . 
  pretty big if . 
  addressing your second point : https://fullfact.org/scotland/tax-and-spending-scotland/ it appears as though scotland would likely be in a similar position to the uk currently if it left , with a similar debt to gdp ratio and requiring tax increases or a reduction in spending according to the ifs . 
   assuming again that scotland continues with the uk government 's cuts , if receipts from oil and gas follow the trend forecast by the office for budget responsibility - which project a decline in revenues - scotland could end up with a deficit of -2.9 % of gdp in 2018-19 . 
  this would again be weaker than the uk 's estimated surplus of 0.2 % of gdp in this scenario , for the same year . 
  this article is from 2013-2014 and much has changed since then budget wise in the uk , but the overall story of `` scotland would need to reduce it 's current spending '' is still there . 
  all the military jobs are pretty easy to point to , i doubt scotland will have a military and will do what ireland does and rely on the uk . 
  also id like to point out the fact that scotland can not keep going at its current deficit and would likely have to cut some services, 
  because scotland already has lower unemployment and the uk provides a lot of government jobs to scotland as well as that uk is a much bigger market than scotland . 
  people will either move to europe or the uk to do business . 
  the uk wasnt on life support in the eu though ? 
  very unlikely . 
  if anything more scots will move south for jobs, 
  your describing pretty much anyone from anywhere, 
  as long as it does n't become like http://www.politifact.com/ and is more along the lines of https://fullfact.org/, 
  is n't that because they define rape differently ? 
  they call them ghettos, 
  for example the usa is less urbanised than sweden 80 % vs. 85 % which i 'm sure would have an effect on these statistics . 
  there are vastly different areas of america that have different laws concerning guns , healthcare and education as well as workers rights . 
  it 's like comparing the whole of germany with berlin , just just a bad comparison in general . 
  comparing the eu to the usa would be a better comparison . 
  there are some places in america that have extremely high crime rates, 
  implying only sun readers think iran is a major threat to peace in the world ? 
  shit canada whats wrong !, 
  how many societies never change ? 
  can confirm , my parents voted remain and i 'm pissed . 
  the generation gap exists in every society no matter what . 
  what does this have to do with how effectively it prevented the movement of east germans to west germany via berlin ? 
  did n't work, 
  source ? 
  which party is that ? 
  your comments reflect a large disdain for the far right wing but you seem pretty trigger happy to place anyone critical of the eu or even a likely libertarian into the category of far right wing/neo nazi . 
  sorted his profile by controversial and did n't see anything that bad on the first few pages , i have n't seen a single post in his history to something like / r/altright . 
  i 'm not sure where you got the idea he was a neo-nazi , although it seems to come from the fact he does n't like immigration and likes guns . 
  which seems to be more right wing than anything extreme right . 
  in which case i suggest you stop using the word `` nazi '' since you clearly do not know the weight of the words you are using . 
  plus most of his posts on switzerland appear to have a positive vote count . 
  lets compare his `` crazy statements '' with yours shall we ? 
   but they were fascists / far right wingers . 
  but obviously people in a far right wing sub like / r/europe do n't want to hear that ... https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4c5lrt/brussels_attacks_police_clash_with_fascists_at/d1fd5uv/?context=10000  it seems like to may brexit means xenophobia  economics . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/56akl7/what_does_brexit_mean/d8hp7qk/?context=3   the vast , vast majority of people who voted for brexit are decent , caring people who had legitimate concerns that  that 's complete bullshit and the opposite of what polls showed . 
  people voted for brexit to hurt others , they voted `` against the elite '' , `` against london '' , `` against foreigners '' . 
   we need to stop the apologist nonsense that brexit supporters are good people and that xenophobia was n't a main factors . 
  the fact that you basically are n't allowed to call out xenophobia anymore is exactly the reason why we see those hate crimes . 
  xenophobia has become a mainstream view and you are n't allowed to criticise that . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/51q3ev/lasting_rise_in_hate_crime_after_eu_referendum/d7e1pie/?context=3 i think we now know who is the crazy extremist , it appears you need to get out of your left wing echo chamber, 
  alt-right care less about terrorism and more about crime statistics and focus a lot on rape , child abuse and woman 's rights . 
  this is attracting many followers especially husbands and more traditional style people . 
  smart phones did n't come out in 2015 though , , has there been a significant rise since smart phones became popular in pickpocketing , if so that 'd be interesting . 
  what if we said they were like a black breed of horse ? 
  i already know german and it 's not very useful apart from having super secret talks with by gf about other people and being able to somewhat understand one or two german youtubers . 
  i already understood the german society kinda and it did n't really expand my knowledge much . 
  it 'll help much more once i move there in a few years however . 
  if anything it 's the girls who are most likely to know a foreign language . 
  good luck . 
  though tbf there are so many european languages you 'd have to be pretty unlucky . 
  tbf why learn another language , many of these nations learning languages are learning english . 
  if you are in britain you do n't learn a language unless you want to live or work abroad or you want to specialise as a linguist . 
  fucking trolled this entire thread, 
  wow that attitude is completely different to the one here . 
  i had to convince my girlfriend to buy a hoise woth me rather thab rent our entire lives . 
  really interesting . 
  btw it looks like the returns in romania on rent are similar to the uk . 
  that 's not a bad return for investment . 
  fair enough then . 
  how much would it cost to rent a place like that ? 
  found the complete opposite , their clothes have lasted me ages and have always been a good quality , fit and style . 
  stop virtue signaling for karma . 
  implying that by sensoring bots you would n't be sensoring humans ? 
  sounds a bit naive, 
  free speech isnot high mindedness it is vital to human progress . 
  silencing opinions you disagree with is wrong and there is very little you could say too convince me or many others otherwise . 
  you want european trump ? 
  do n't speak too soon . 
  i thought we were talking about the usa ? ... 
  lol, 
  people love to hate on the usa because its not perfectly fitting their idea of a great nation . 
  every nation on earth listens to their music , and watches their films , follows their dress codes and have similar fashion . 
  their sports are worldwidely watched their elections are taken note of worldwide . 
  you could barely say that about any other nation . 
  well they appear to be doing better than most of europe https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp, 
  who will be remembered in 500 years . 
  the us presidents or swedens prime ministers ? 
  they are the most culturally influential and economically influential as well . 
  it was .
