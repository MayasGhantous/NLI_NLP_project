  samara ? 
  of the top of my head . 
  if not bricks , then for propaganda/control reasons . 
  oh no , i completly understand what you 're saying and i have this hilarious image of a russian homosexual walking up to the sign and just thinking `` wow , how about that ! '', 
  what scares/upsets me is that the mere mention of these is supposed to be fearmongering/bad . 
  i do n't . 
  it highlights how homophobia is so implanted in peoples minds in russia . 
  i hope not . 
  hopefully if there is , they will have no reason to nuke north yorkshire . 
  on second thoughts , nuke north yorkshire and i can take a long holiday in the bahamas . 
  sadly this is just a myth and has no historical basis or fact :(, 
  because it was settled by dutch colonists ? 
  does n't mean that there was a greater amount of dutch immigrants . 
  exactly . 
  researching certain topics or going on websites that cite links/sources often gets them banned for ` pornography ' . 
  winged hussars ... against tanks . 
  edit : wow this post was unpopular . 
  and the nose sniffing, 
  have you seen a single media article about terrorism in the last 14 years ? 
  you know they learn both languages ... ? 
  i think its the classes . 
  i took french for about 8 years and i can just about say `` please '' and `` thank you '' . 
  meanwhile , i took spanish for about 3 years and can get around just fine in barcelona . 
  jordan had like 2 million refugees at the moment . 
  yeah why is racist pseudo science getting up voted, 
  i know i was just making a joke . 
  so sikhs are behind is ? 
  i knew it !, 
  conservatives are pro migrants anyway . 
  id say they 're more neoliberal in view . 
  my guide at auschwitz made it very clear the town was oswiecim , i guess she did n't want it to be known for the german crimes . 
  as they say about the bombs ... 
  hoping to dear god i can catch a plane to toronto next morning instead of staying in ... slough . 
  yes , feels that they are scared of brown men with beards, 
  while you 're being over the top it is a little frustrating seeing people blame the horrible things on their leadership only . 
  are you referring to ttip ? 
  `` zick-zacky '' is that how you say it in germany ? 
  in the uk we say `` zig zaggy '' . 
  tbh i do n't see why this is a problem , i do n't want people googling my name and finding information about me . 
  there is a huge difference between south yorkshire and north yorkshire accents too !, 
  except [ one ] ( https://therationalpessimist.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/imf-revisions-to-greek-gdp-growth-jpeg1.jpg ) can [ easily ] ( http://www.acting-man.com/blog/media/2011/05/gdp-growth-greece1.png ) see that there is [ significant ] ( http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/images/imf_oct10_figure_3.jpg ) change after 2011 , when your graph stops . 
  why are you using an image from 2011 rather than 2014/5 ? 
  seems a little misleading to me . 
  how long can we not dance or have fun until they stop grieving then ? 
  what ? 
  did you mean to reply to someone else ? 
  i was just backing your point that watson is a scumbag . 
  that very same james watson who thinks that blacks are less intelligent than whites , that very same james watson who discovered the double helix . 
  tell that to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014, 
  at the time of commenting [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/390p5l/over_2000000_europeans_have_now_signed_the/crzf869 ) was the top comment . 
  but you 're not doing anything to disagree with him ... ttip is a free trade agreement . 
  it is n't ** the ** free trade agreement asked in the survey , because there was no specific agreement mentioned in the survey . 
  you 're creating a false dichotomy . 
  is this thread being brigaded , or has / r/europe suddenly decided it loves ttip now ? 
  redditors do n't like getting told they 're racist, 
  well , seeing the recent post about constantinople/istanbul ... 
  is he saying the que bit ? 
  i absolutely adore simplicimuss . 
  it 's great for all sorts of insight into the world , or at least the german one , of the time . 
  turkey is practically a first world country . 
  other than some rural parts the quality of life is fine . 
  would n't that be blocked under german censorship law anyway ? 
  it 's only shrinking in central europe because they are n't getting migrants . 
  if we were to cut off all migration then we would be in negative population growth , i believe . 
  it annoys me too . 
  so does polish anti-migration sentiment . 
  we 've taken in millions of yours , how would poland react if germany and the uk expelled poles ? 
  there were major differences between the two , it is not like 1984 where they 're one and the same . 
   how many times in history has this been true https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_kingdom_general_elections 19 times since 1945 , 12 times since the representation of the people act . 
  no i prefer a stable and functioning state system over being owned by someone else . 
  it 's a real power fantasy , neoliberalism . 
  in their minds , they 're the ones who own the big banks and companies . 
  but they 'd rather throw away their vote to a big company , than say , help make society a better place . 
  no , it 's called democracy . 
  if the government fails we vote a new one in . 
  whereas in libertarian land you do n't get a vote , you get a company and a contract . 
  you 'll forgive me if i prefer parliamentary democracy to selling off our state to china and apple . 
  nothing says freedom like junior doctors striking and the snoopers charter, 
  god i hate libertarians . 
  the nhs is slowly starving , our military is underfunded and the disabled are getting screwed over , but `` muh taxes !!!!, 
  i ca n't imagine this happening to pm cameron . 
  politics is n't some magical blank slate where one ideology is pure and reason based . 
  if there was we would have reached utopia in ancient greece . 
  actually it 's a very simple tactic . 
  do something in the name of free speech 2 . 
  stop doing it when others complain/you face repercussions 3 . 
  claim you are being censored/harassed/etc . 
  that 's some roman shit, 
   give monthly 500 pln each month for rising kids except demographically this is really stupid . 
  as europe moves towards both austerity and an ageing demographic , no matter what efforts poland takes they will slowly advanced forwards demographically . 
  increasing the population so that they have a greater workforce in 10 ~ years , but then having to pay the additional education , child care , health and so on costs ( and do n't mention pensions ) is an unsustainable policy . 
  immigration in germany and the uk have allowed this problem to generally be avoided as eu laws allow certain benefits to be denied , allowing the social security net to hold up . 
  but to suddenly increase the birth rates would be chaos to any country - see russia and half of africa . 
  i like it on mobile !, 
  you heard of a little thing called the troubles mate ? 
  me and my family were there last month so unless some big shit went down i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  edit : here today to see the bronte museum . 
  still no sign of verbal attacks yet . 
  so tory + ? 
  you know i 've seen this mentioned a lot but only after reading your last bit i realised the effect that these discussions can have .
