  they could probably roflstomp all over europe and asia together but an invasion of the us just is n't a possibility . 
  yeah , in arabic there 's a phrase that translates as ` tomorrow in the apricot ' which roughly means ` when hell freezes over ' . 
  some phrases just do n't make any sense when translated into other languages . 
  it would probably be `` live up to their stereotype '' . 
  no problem , i 'm just despairing about the state of my nation . 
  this genuinely makes me sad . 
  umm ... 
  i was refering to the article that / u/lolkac posted above . 
  i was n't talking about putin . 
  i understand perfectly well how he came to power . 
  read the article , it 's excellent \\ ^ ^, 
  how did that man ever become a councilor ... 
  i mean , people must have noticed something off about him , but they decided to vote for him anyway ? 
  greece is n't in a position to negotiate the rules . 
  the only leverage greece had was the threat of going bankrupt and fucking up the eurozone . 
  that only works so long as the potential damage a grexit would cause is greater than the damaged greece is perceived as causing . 
  right now that balance is tipping the other way . 
  its happening again !, 
  quick , clear the shelves of irish milk and somebody alert the queen !, 
  your original comment mentioned decades of peace for europe , i just thought i would point out lots of european nations have been fighting along side america for the past decade . 
  here is thought , britain suffered economically by maintaining its empire in the 1920s and 1930s . 
  if we had begun withdrawing from empire at that stage we could have had a longer , more profitable and better thought out decline from power . 
  the stage at which the cost of hegemony outweighs the benefits is the point at which you should start giving it up . 
  cricket old boy !, 
  we gave them trains and cricket , the greatest gifts one nation can give to another . 
  the uk has lost more than 600 soldiers fight with america since 2001 . 
  we have fought with the us for over a decade and suffered terrorist attacks on our country as a direct result . 
  we pulled our weight and we can spend our money however we choose . 
  if the us decides it wants to spend billions every year on maintaining their military that is their call . 
  if you object to that then deal with it yourself within your own country instead of scapegoating europe . 
  neither of these points address the fact taht there are literally thousands of israel born palestinians that are denied citizenship , a citizenship that ** any ** jew anywhere in the world can claim , because of their ethnicity . 
  nor does it address the fact that this same group is often driven out of their homes in order to make way for jewish settlers or for the fact that these people can at anytime be deported from their country of birth and forced into gaza without money , housing or any other form of support . 
  there are plenty of palestinians who were born and raised in what is now israel who are refused citizenship , the right to vote and even the right to a home . 
  they have to justify every two years why they should be allowed to continue to live in israel . 
  they could deal with that without even engaging with palestine . 
  apartheid system aside . 
  greece has to maintain a 4 % budget surplus , that is including the money they get from the troika , in other words other countries . 
  that and the spending restrictions are the parts that seem to stick most in syriza 's throat . 
  but they do n't really have a choice over it . 
  they have next to no ability to raise funds , other than through treasury bills which are an insanely expensive way of funding a deficit . 
  austerity for greece , is n't . 
  it is greece as a country living closer but still not within its means . 
  its entire budget exists on sufferance . 
  the internals of the eu need to be solid before it can have an army . 
  fiscal union first , followed by united foreign policy , then some form of political union and only then may you have your shiny explosive toys to play with . 
   how is it respecting the law when they are basically plotting a coup ? 
  those that are plotting some kind of violent coup are breaking the law . 
  those that want to establish some form of theocracy democratically are welcome to try . 
  they are operating within the law , their aims are n't mine and as i said before i will fight tooth and nail against them but they are welcome to try . 
  this may come as a surprise to you but disagreeing with you is not the same thing as treason . 
   you 're biased because you 're his friend true enough , let me alter that to i do not believe all irish people to be a threat . 
  nor do i hold all the irish responsible for the actions of the ira and pira . 
   french secularity ( french : la\u00efcit\u00e9 , pronounced [ laisite ] ) is the absence of religious involvement in government affairs as well as absence of government involvement in religious affairs . 
  you are arguing for government intervention in religious affairs in direct contravention of la\u00efcit\u00e9 . 
   claiming the remedies are racist i have n't called your views racist . 
  islam is n't a race . 
  i have n't demanded that france adopts anything . 
  i do n't much care if the fn gets elected . 
   lots of people break the law without being gettig kicked out . 
  going to jail is being removed from society . 
  that is the whole point of prison it is exile from society . 
  and here is some food for thought : first they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew . 
  then they came for the communists and i did not speak out because i was not a communist . 
  then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist . 
  then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me . 
  all of these are examples of ways in which the holy book does n't matter . 
  none of these texts are obeyed by christians these days i 'm not even sure how often some of these were obeyed during the middle ages . 
  people will obey their holy book when it suits them and ignore it when it does n't . 
  as far as the ottoman empire is concerned here are some quotes i found in the wikipedia article you posted :  in the ottoman imperial system , even though there existed an hegemonic power of muslim control over the non-muslim populations , non-muslim communities had been granted state recognition and protection in the islamic tradition . 
   under the millet system , non-muslim people were considered subjects of the empire , but were not subject to the muslim faith or muslim law . 
  the orthodox millet , for instance , was still officially legally subject to justinian 's code , which had been in effect in the byzantine empire for 900 years . 
  i do not smoke joints when writing comments and i do not imagine you as hitler . 
  i made the point that the nazi 's used the same logic as you to justify the mass slaughter of civilians but i never accused you of being a nazi . 
  my point seems to have flown over your head so i will reiterate it . 
  what the holy books says does not matter . 
  people use ideology as a means to achieve their own ends if they do n't want to act in a violent fashion they will interpret their ideology as one of peace . 
  if they do wish to be violent they will turn it into one of war . 
  just look at buddhism its about as peaceful a religion as you can get but in myanmar they 're using it as an excuse to engage in widespread racial violence . 
  if you want proof just look at attitudes towards religion in the ottoman empire . 
  there were n't forced conversions , there was little in the way of religious violence and discrimination was minimal . 
  the ottomans wanted to use islam as building block of empire and so they disregarded all the kill the kaffar stuff and focused on the respect the peoples of the book section instead . 
  i hope i have adequately explained my point this time . 
  respect for the law is n't a value , it is a compulsory part of being a member of a state . 
  you can not be part of a state if you do not respect that states laws . 
  this applies to every kind of state even theocratic ones . 
  those that want to create a theocratic state may well have different fundamental values to me but so long as they respect the law they are entitled to hold those different values and even act on them . 
  you had a whole bit about how christianity endorsed this notion of turning the other cheek etc. 
  i did n't bring up christianity you did . 
  i am not trying to derail the subject .

  not as impressive as some of the others here but it 's pretty aesthetically pleasing : [ 1 ] ( http://www.google.co.il/imgres?imgurl=http://paradiseintheworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/durham-castle.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.4gress.com/sights/entry/101126.html&amp;h=854&amp;w=1280&amp;tbnid=bnr93oi2qazqkm:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=nuowlwv02mqc8m&amp;ei=fzh7vj_tk4ukygoj94cadq&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0cduqmygfmau ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.google.co.il/imgres?imgurl=http://photodb.schreder.com/mediadb/project/projectsreference/monuments-and-facades-durham-castle-durham-united-kingdom-neos-led-schreder-0054_n30-006.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.schreder.com/gbu-en/projects/pages/durhamcastle.aspx&amp;h=440&amp;w=675&amp;tbnid=yr72qofkthhwlm:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=td-bxztk4s5bhm&amp;ei=fzh7vj_tk4ukygoj94cadq&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0cgkqmygvmc8 ) its also still used as a college by durham university so students live in it and it has a bar in the basement . 
  also there is [ this ] ( http://www.google.co.il/imgres?imgurl=https://sweffling.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dscn1564.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://sweffling.wordpress.com/tag/durhan-university/&amp;h=2736&amp;w=3648&amp;tbnid=s6dh9qivsbwzam:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=ap7spylckq5dsm&amp;ei=tpl7vo_hmqa7ygo14ylwbg&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0cb4qmygwmby4za ) view from the front door which is n't too shoddy . 
  i 've always loved craigievar . 
  the scots baronial style is just gorgeous and it 's a great place to spend an afternoon . 
  i did n't say anything about giving up freedoms and the closest i came to saying i wanted to stop offending them was that ** forcing ** someone to view cartoons that mock their religion is unhelpful . 
  but sure you go right ahead and straw-man the shit out my argument . 
  i have no intention of giving up freedoms to islam and if an islamic party is ever entered in an election in britain i will fight against them tooth and nail but i will accept their right to exist and argue whatever it is they are arguing . 
  hell i will even defend their right to say whatever it is they want to say . 
  also there you go again with that collective responsibility again :  the only people behaving like tyrants are muslims i 've said this to you before but i 'll say it again , blaming the majority for the actions of the few is the same logic that causes genocides and also , seeing as you brought it up the same logic used by the wehrmacht when they executed thousands of innocent french people for the actions of the resistance . 
  my point is that a person can use any ideology they want to endorse their violence .
