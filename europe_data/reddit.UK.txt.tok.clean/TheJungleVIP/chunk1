after a hard day voting ukip i like to spend my evenings drinking so much great british ale ^ ^ tm that i shit some imperial measurement of explosive diarrhoea onto a pile of european phrase books before wiping my arse with a picture of charles de gaulle . 
  - an average british person , according to / r/europe, 
  ... a couple months ago, 
  as long as you keep importing tyskie i do n't give a fuck what you do, 
  bloody poles coming over here and stealing our bigotry, 
  i 've always said the eu needs more gerry adams, 
  is the idea of france leaving euro seriously suggested by anyone ? 
  genuine question , by the way . 
  nobody is arguing that hamas are completely innocent , but that israel 's retaliation has been extremely disproportionate and , more importantly , very indiscriminate in it 's targets . 
  also , thanks to the endless stream of support from the west , israel has military technology decades ahead of the palestinians and far more of it so it 's pretty unfair to make out like this is something even approaching a fair fight . 
  can you expand on what you mean by blackmailing ? 
  also , why does condemning israel mean the same thing as submitting `` to a campaign of warfare by a genocidal terrorist organization that is hamas '' ? 
  we 'll grab our ready meals and prosthetic limbs and fight for our freedom !, 
  yes 2014 !, 
  parachutes for all !, 
   england :  glaswegian ** sit fucking down **, 
  it 's nothing new , every day on / r/europe are sensationalist non-stories that get people all angry about the stubborn , belligerent uk government and the knuckle dragging misinformed racists that elected them . 
  so what if he did ? 
  you know we do n't walk around all say talking about how much we hate the eu , right ? 
  this is reported on constantly because anti eu sentiment in the uk/anti uk sentiment in the eu is one of cheapest click bait topics someone can post , so lets not make out that we are these perpetually irritated disney villains . 
  `` fucking casuals '' -- santa claus, 
  because that shit ai n't gon na stir itself, 
  not that i necessarily agree with it , but the argument is that we should be fast tracked into the eu since so many ( if not all ) of the qualifying criteria are already met since we are already a member ( albeit as part of the larger uk ), 
  this makes me feel a little better . 
  this sub is sometimes not above condemning the uk because of the likes of ukip so it 's nice to be reminded everywhere has the crazies . 
  ** hitler ** there . 
  i said it . 
  can we get on with our day now please ? 
  that 'd make a good tv show, 
   fries * squeezes stress ball *, 
  javascript as you may know is a programming language . 
  now most programming languages have things called libraries which you can think of as basically being ready made tools for developers . 
  if i 'm programming a bathroom i might want to use the `` water pump '' library , of if i 'm making an app for a phone there might be a library that lets me use the camera in my app . 
  jquery is one such library for the javascript programming language :-) as for relevance ? 
  fucked if i know . 
  he mad, 
  just fuckin ' try it , sunshine . 
  u mad bro ? 
  aww shucks ... 
  it all makes sense now, 
  `` shut the door behind you , then wipe the handle . '', 
  oh just like straight people do ? 
   god forbid you even dare look sideways and a person who might be gay and you 're suddenly automatically the worst person in the world i do n't even understand what this means . 
  do you mean you are uncomfortable around someone who you think might be gay ? 
  if so then suck it up and quit your bitching . 
  it 's your problem , not societies . 
  the guy is a wanker , i 'll give you that , but he did n't do what the link says he did . 
  it is a complete misrepresentation . 
  if you must be condescending to the uk at least do it because of things that have actually happened . 
  apparently the entire uk is represented by something that one guy never actually said in the first place . 
  got it . 
  victory through obscurity !, 
  : winbros fist :, 
  this is n't a school though . 
  this is a seminar attended by adults voluntarily . 
  it is n't solely attended by people of one religious belief , so why should they bend to his demands ? 
  also those schools splitting for religious reasons do n't excuse this situation , all that proves is that those schools are just as backward as this guy . 
  do n't be so obtuse , this is in no way similar to all boy/girl schools . 
  it is all about the intent . 
  sex specific schools are split for educational reasons . 
  what are this guys reasons ? 
  but in this case listening to what they have to say would involve submitting , at least to some degree , to their insanity just so you could be in the room . 
  if i have to be seen taking part in that to hear his opinion then he take whatever he has to say and shove it up his arse . 
  why did you feel the need to go there ? 
  my comment could have been written by someone from literally anywhere else in the uk , but obviously i 'm just some snp shill . 
  touch\u00e9 !, 
  seriously though i do apologise , it 's of course wrong to refer to regions as single entities . 
  edited my previous comment . 
   it shows that brits still have n't overcome the enormous loss of signifance of their country in the last century . 
  til everyone in the uk is nigel farage, 
  thank you . 
  it really irritates me when people from outside the uk think that we are all spoken for by middle england and the south east . 
  edit : can this be considered for the world 's most ironic comment award ? 
  this is so embarrassing, 
  we 'd just deep fry the bastards . 
  with fucking pleasure . 
  tunnocks for pudding !, 
  but she 's smiling !, 
  ** she is obviously happy no more questions **, 
  the man proposing this is a well renowned fuck wit . 
  this has as much chance of happening as nuclear weapons being sold in supermarkets . 
  i disagree with the pro-uk side but that 's not what downvotes are for . 
  one does what one can :d, 
  we 've had an snp government since 2007 ... 
  do you honestly think they do n't realise that ? 
  is that why it produces all that black liquid ? 
  hey it took me ages to realise and i 'm neither american nor stoned, 
  no need to be a jackass about it . 
  so what you 're saying is , the uk is rorschach ? 
  if there was a currency of just germany , the netherlands and scandinavia you could probably convince the uk to join it too . 
  more like `` i 'm gon na do it ! ... ... actually nah maybe not ... . you try '', 
  how original . 
  nobody tell him about the tax dodging radioactive greek pensioners . 
  are they actively trying to kill it or what ? 
  gaelic here is in the very low numbers . 
  i was recently talking to my friend in the outer hebrides who said although most people can speak gaelic out there very few of them do . 
  also the enthusiasm for gaelic medium education is apparently much stronger on the mainland than it is in the hebrides . 
  i do love the sound of the language . 
  it 's like the swedish chef in a kilt . 
  well * someone * has to wind up the french , if anybody wants to take a shift we could do with a break,
