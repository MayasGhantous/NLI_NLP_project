  because he did n't want to . 
   europe is a region , not a continent . 
  asia is also a region . 
  it forms eurasia along with europe . 
  clarkson punched a producer . 
  i liked top gear but he deserved to get fired . 
  he only has himself to blame . 
  besides , him , hammond and may will have a new show . 
   so someone like him who is middle aged ? 
  maybe but you can answer my other question . 
   he is old so someone like him who is middle aged ? 
   i doubt he too would know where research money should go . 
  why would n't he know where the research money should go ? 
  he seems have a lot of interest in science . 
  would you prefer if someone like george coyne was made the minister for science ? 
  it 's better than margaret thatcher . 
  come on our girls . 
  wait , on second thought . 
   if only the uk could also join the euro at least you can dream about it . 
   you just kept replying . 
  because you replied to my comment . 
   and apparently down voting me . 
  i did n't downvote you . 
  yes . 
  i know there are a lot of websites but just looking through some of them will tell you plenty of things that you can do . 
  go to / r/travel if you want to individual experiences . 
  / r/europe is n't the place . 
  google lists websites that can . 
  you have n't told us what you 're interested in so how can we recommend places .

  i 've never heard anyone use canicule . 
  that 's not an english word but you can use canicular . 
  ah right . 
  thanks . 
  i knew he said queen but what does veult mean ? 
  what ? 
  there 's only flights to luton and stanstead so you would have to go into london and get a bus or train to cardiff . 
  the bus will be the cheapest . 
  i think d\u00fcsseldorf is near to dortmund . 
  flybe have a direct flight to cardiff from there and bmi regional have a flight to bristol . 
  have you been there ? 
  plane . 
  you could fly to cardiff or bristol . 
  where are you staying in germany ? 
  you sired with flynn ? 
  you shaved tim ?

  you heard him . 
  i do n't know . 
  bloody aussies . 
  okay . 
  it was hot in london yesterday . 
   need # 500k of salary to live in london . 
  no you fucking do n't . 
  my parents do n't earn anywhere near that amount of money and they can live in london . 
   secondly these friends all live very comfortable lives . 
  regular ski trips , michelin-starred restaurants , frequent use of taxis , babysitters used at least once a week -- these are all a given . 
  but they all have budgets , manage their finances pretty carefully , and bitch about the cost of living . 
    live in houses worth # 4m + . 
     use private schools . 
       # 15k groceries . 
  they can fuck off and stop complaining . 
  it 's shocking . 
  and yet so many irish people still choose to emigrate to the u.k. why is that ? 
  and it was a joke regarding your civil war . 
  but you still did n't win the actual war . 
  and you did a good job with your independence . 
   but the trend of massive immigration ended a while back but the u.s still has a lot of immigrants from mexico . 
   finally , mexico is not part of central america well it 's all north america then . 
  that 's not surprising considering it is close to central america . 
  i 'd probably be upset . 
  but that 's how a democracy works . 
  lets say 55 % of scots voted for independence . 
  that would leave 45 % of scots who do n't want to leave . 
  but they to accept it . 
  yes , if they the majority of the population of that part wanted to . 
  i would n't mind if scotland left the u.k. 
   cornwall they can leave if they want to . 
  the election is over now , david . 
  i would n't call it huge anymore . 
  that was back in 2004 . 
  ireland is short as well . 
  the irish is \u00c9ire . 
  i was n't paying enough attention . 
  i put reykjavik since i consider iceland a european country . 
  edit : it was continental europe . 
  i put italy and it said that was the correct answer . 
  and the pitcairn islands . 
  yes , that british overseas territory that most people in the u.k have never heard of . 
  google translate comes up with this : * really ? 
  you know where this hole is ? 
  i can assure you that in france we are all looking for him on the cards . 
  * so they must be translating themselves . 
  well a water salute is n't a serbian custom . 
  they want to leave the eu . 
  donegal airport . 
  i 'd buy him a pint but they are paying for their own drinks after that .
