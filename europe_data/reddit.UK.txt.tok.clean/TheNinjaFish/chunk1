`` oh no , we 're not islamophobic , we just do n't think europe can cope ! '', 
  yes , if the laws are highly xenophobic , then expecting everyone to follow these laws can be seen as racist . 
  i do n't think that `` stormfront is organizing a takeover of / r/europe '' , but this sub has gotten ridiculously racist recently . 
   we will not stand for the fucking signs being removed [ ... ] what 's this big fucking joke ? 
  this had to have been on purpose . 
  that might have been the case in eastern europe , but here in the west the pro-refugee demonstrations today were massive . 
  the snp and scottish greens are left wing and want independence . 
  the right wing parties ( including labour who were n't exactly super left wing under miliband ) are the ones that want to stay . 
   the ** vast majority ** of the immigrants do n't want to live in the sparsely populated rural areas . 
  that article was about around thirty people wanting to live in a city eight months ago . 
  * [ citation needed ] *, 
  jfc what is up with all this blatant xenophobia happening on this sub all of a sudden ? 
  if you read [ the report ] ( http://www.ln-online.de/lokales/luebeck/puttgarden-faehr-und-zugverkehr-unterbrochen ) where this claim comes from , it clearly says :  `` die fl\u00fcchtlinge veranstalteten auf dem bahnhof eine art sitzblockade , weil sie weiter nach schweden ** zu ihren familien reisen wollen . 
  ** '' the refugees held at the station a kind of sit-in because they want to travel to sweden ** to their families . 
  ** these people had their families travel to sweden and they want to stay with them . 
  this is n't being ungrateful , or asking for too much , this is simply asking to be with family . 
  well , people living in big cities tend to be less racist/xenophobic . 
  in the uk , the highest concentration of ukip votes came from more remote areas with low levels of diversity . 
  i think it 's fair to say that people who live in an actual multicultural society are more accepting of it than people who have only heard of multiculturalism from the news . 
  if they 're experts , that means they have extensively researched the effects of migration and we should listen to them . 
  it 's like not believing in evolution because you do n't want to listen to biologists because you think your own experiences outweigh their research . 
  ` well , i 've seen apes around today therefore i think evolution is n't real ' , if you listen to biologists you 'll know that they 've explained everything . 
  same goes with experts on migration . 
  i 'm not saying not to invest in their economy , maybe my comment was worded badly . 
  i just do n't agree with the daily mail exploiting the situation for a ` cheap getaway ' . 
  yeah who cares about being a decent human being with empathy when you can maximise profits ? 
  nice counter argument . 
  i provided solid statistics and data to show you that the higher percentage of bme people in prisons is down to institutionalised racism , you linked me to a xenophobic subreddit and an article that supported my views . 
  i think that strict immigration policies and straight-up fear mongering in the media does way more harm than good . 
  it gives islamist fighters more reasons to hate the west and perpetuates a very ` us-vs-them ' mentality . 
  saying that french-born french citizens are n't really french because of their parents results in immigrants not feeling welcome , making it harder for them to settle in and adapt to different cultures . 
  it 's this type of racist rhetoric and marginalisation that drives people to extremism in the first place . 
  holy shit . 
  this is more than just the casual racism you see on reddit , this is straight up fascism . 
  there 's a difference between actual crime committed and people sentenced . 
  the simple fact is that black people are far more likely to be arrested for a crime that would usually result in a white person being let off with a warning . 
  drug use statistics are [ pretty much equal between different races ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2377408/ ) , yet black people are 27 % more likely to be arrested for drug use than white people , and asians are [ 41 % more likely ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/nov/25/ethnic-variations-jail-sentences-study ) . 
  1 ) i do n't think you know what hypocrite means . 
  2 ) maybe , * just maybe * , this statistic can be attributed to systematic marginalisation and institutionalised racism , the article that you linked talks about this :  [ equality and human rights commission found that young black and asian citizens were six times as likely to be stopped as white citizens , noting the figure had remained `` stubbornly high '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24902389 ) -  former home office official mike hough , now associate director at the [ institute for criminal policy research ] ( http://www.icpr.org.uk/ ) , also believes that the most likely explanation is `` differential treatment '' of young ethnic minority suspects by both police and prosecutors . 
  * `` someone more likely to be stopped and searched would be more at risk of arrest or warning , which would put them further down the road to formal proceedings if they were re-arrested , and so on , '' * hough explains . 
  it seems like you did n't even read the article . 
   black offenders presented before a sentencing judge , for example , are ** 44 % more likely to be given custodial sentences for driving offences than white people , 37 % more likely for public order offences or possession of a weapon , and 27 % more likely for drug possession . 
  ** meanwhile , asian offenders are 19 % more likely to be given custodial sentences for shoplifting , and 41 % more likely for drug offences . 
  3 ) did you seriously post a link to / r/european ? 
  a subreddit where [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3b5mc4/my_danish_friends_class/ ) is current sitting at number five on the front page ? 
  [ * skyrocketing * ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a8/recorded_crime%2c_eu-28%2c_2002%e2%80%9312_%281%29_%28millions%29_yb14.png )  source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:recorded_crime,_eu-28,_2002%e2%80%9312_ ( 1 ) _ ( millions ) _ yb14.png [ * it truly is the end of days * ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22275280 ) [ * it 's political correctness gone mad * ] ( http://www.cato.org/blog/majority-americans-misperceive-crime-trends ) [ * europe 's gone to shit ever since mass immigration * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) [ * who do they think they are * ] ( https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/crime-statistics/international_statistics_on_crime_and_justice.pdf ) ( warning : massive pdf ), 
  it 's almost like the only way to solve this is to * gasp * not be an islamophobe . 
   french citizens born in paris so yes , homegrown, 
  when you say ` muslim ' , most people immediately jump to ` arab ' . 
  in fact , i would guess many people assume that all arabs are also muslims . 
  they 're the ones that people usually discriminate against and marginalise , hence racism . 
  either way , you can call it islamophobia or racism , if the crux of the argument that you 're not being racist hinges on the fact that muslims are n't technically a race , then you 're probably being racist . 
  there 's practically no risk whatsoever , the media plays this way out of proportion . 
  there is absolutely no need to carry a gun with you ` in case of terrorists ' . 
  i 'm not saying that terrorist attacks are n't awful acts , they are , when they happen . 
  the risk of you being the victim of a terrorist attack anywhere in europe is so incredibly negligible that there 's no point worrying too much about it on a daily basis . 
  again , how is that apologetic to terrorists ? 
  how was his comment in any way apologetic to terrorists ? 
  it really depends on where in the uk you 're talking about . 
  i 'm not sure how it is in scotland but in london you find a lot of second and third generation immigrants speaking their family 's language at home and english everywhere else . 
  i just went there and saw [ this ] ( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/european/comments/345wz3/ukip_offers_christians_who_object_to_gay_marriage/cqrjv7t ) . 
  from what i can see so far it 's full of islamophobic , racist , anti-semitic , homophobes . 
  what ? 
  you 've never heard of a cigarette tree before ? 
   premise 3 : the majority of irregular migrants entering europe are people who consider themselves muslim . 
  people fail to realise that the refugees ( the ones that call themselves muslim ) are ** fleeing from isis ** because they 're trying to kill them . 
  the people who carry out these attacks ( the ones from premise 2 ) call themselves muslim whilst simultaneously murdering other muslims . 
  the us left because the vietnamese beat them , they were able to keep their government and go more or less back to normal . 
  in iraq , the us left because they managed to topple the government . 
  when they left the region they left a power vacuum which is where this all stems from . 
  huh ? 
   david graduated oxford in 1988 and would 've supposedly fucked a pig in what . . 1978 . 
  ah yes , taking part in a university club 's initiation ten years before graduating university , seven years before even joining university , when you 're 12 . 
  if this did happen , it most likely happened sometime between 1985 and 1988 , and i 'd assume they 'd have cameras to capture people 's initiations . 
   it was literally made by somebody who hates him someone who had extremely close ties to the conservative party , a literal tory lord . 
  a former close friend claimed he saw a photo of cameron sticking it into a dead pig 's head . 
   people keep posting about this definition and that definition , but really the definitions are actually pretty simple and well established in society . 
  racism is prejudice , discrimination , hate , etc. 
  based on race . 
  institutional racism is racism done on the institutional level through policies or how policies are enforced . 
  yeah , there 's the commonly held definition , and using that definition you could say that women of colour can be sexist/racist . 
  but there 's also the academic definition , used by sociologists when discussing gender politics and race , which means spreading institutionalised racism/sexism against an oppressed group . 
   if someone is capable of getting into an executive position in an institution today than they are capable of perpetrating institutional racism today . 
  it does n't matter if that executive is male , female , gay , straight , trans , black , asian , white , etc. 
  if they are capable of influencing policies then they are capable of influencing policies . 
  when people say that women of colour ca n't be sexist/racist , they mean that they ca n't be racist against white people , or sexist against men . 
  they are more than capable of perpetuating their own oppression , but they ca n't add to the systematic oppression against white men because there is none to start with . 
   i mean this thread is about a specific women who twitted #killallwhitemen and tried to use her officer position to take away rights from white men . 
  she wanted to create a safe space for women of colour , she was n't ` taking away rights from white men ' . 
  now , this policy could be seen as discriminatory , and that 's technically right , it discriminates against people because of their race and gender . 
  but here we see the issue with calling this behaviour racist or sexist ; her policies were a * reaction * to institutionalised racism and sexism , a reaction to a culture where women of colour are n't regarded , are n't given as much interest as white men . 
  calling these policies racist or sexist implies that it is just as bad as segregation , or just as bad as institutionalised racism or sexism , but they 're not ( arguably ) , they 're a reaction to it , a means to get people to experience less racism and sexism . 
  no one thinks that , 99 % of posts on / r/tumblrinaction ( which is where i 'm guessing you got this information ) is satire . 
   to say women or minorities are incapable of institutional racism is to say they are flat out incapable of gaining any sort of power in any sort of institution . 
  which is a rather insulting view of the capabilities of women and minorities . 
  it 's not saying that at all , it simply means that they do n't hold significant power in our society at the moment . 
  no where does the idea that oppressed groups ca n't perpetuate institutional oppression imply that they can not ever gain power , it just means that discrimination against oppressors does n't perpetuate systematic oppression . 
  the main issue here is how you define ` racism ' and ` sexism ' . 
  if you take it simply to mean ` discrimination based off of race or sex ' then yeah , people of colour can be racist and women can be sexist . 
  however , if you take the sociological definition of ` perpetuating institutionalised/systematic oppression against oppressed races/sexes ' then no , they ca n't be racist or sexist , because there is no systematic oppression against white men .
