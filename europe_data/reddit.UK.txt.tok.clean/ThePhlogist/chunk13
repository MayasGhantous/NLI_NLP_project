  some intern clearly could n't be bothered this morning . 
   still subjected to passport checks in london while i 'm all in favour of the conservatives shutting the fuck up and joining schengen , passport control especially for eu citizens takes about 30 seconds or less . 
  it 's not something you should need to be giving the poor immigration official a hard time for . 
  take a chill pill . 
  i thought he meant sweet as in cute and cuddly ... i get way to into data ... . ^ ^ / r/dataisbeautiful, 
  fore example , [ programs like these ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32wocblw_a ), 
  soooo 2002 . 
  now now . 
  this is all on purpose ; the gulf stream will soon be disturbed by global warming and northern europe will become like northern canada and you lot are all un-prepared . 
  our women are just fattening up for the perpetual winter soon to come . 
  our men have stopped giving a shit too because girls will have to cross icy tundra to find a new partner so in reality the nearest girl to you has little choice but to fuck you and only you for years to come . 
  i 'm just going to grab the hottest girl i can when i feel it fall below -10 and wait for the ice age to set in . 
  calm down . 
  it 's fake news . 
  i honestly would not have batted an eyelid if it had been true . 
  we do have some shitty obesity stats and i would not be surprised if that led to poor health generally not just attractiveness . 
  most of the people i know are sporty and healthy but the numbers do n't lie . 
  hang on . 
  they spelt ` czech ' right but still made the mistake ? 
  i 've been a fan for a few years now . 
  the man 's a legend and you should indeed be proud . 
  got to love guy . 
  he 's a good speaker . 
  kind of surprised uk police files are not already shared tbh . 
  they passed a law recently to allow private companies to offer to do the work of running hospitals for the nhs for a price = to or better than the nhs . 
  the system itself will never charge it 's just the people who you actually talk to work for a private company not the government . 
  the worry is that private companies will try to cut costs the government would not cut meaning they save money and make profit but the service suffers . 
  there was never any question of charging for it . 
  that was [ the point of his reforms ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8560528/nhs-reforms-health-service-must-change-to-remain-free-to-all-warns-david-cameron.html ) to save money to allow it to stay free ... if you believe him . 
  the uk 's unemployment rate is [ better than many others ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:unemployment_rates,_seasonally_adjusted,_february_2013.png&amp;filetimestamp=20130402080742 ) in the eurozone . 
  your unlikely to find better work prospects in another country if you ca n't find them in your own . 
  also what 's your problem with healthcare ? 
  the uk system is totally free with no need for insurance at any level . 
  which system do you think would serve you better and why ? 
  noise on the streets is illegal in france after 22:00 iirc . 
  makes me want to move . 
  they should make it illegal to make noise between 6 in the evening and 12 noon imo . 
  does swedish law have such a thing as private nuisance ? 
  if so people can sue under that for the disturbance . 
  if such a right of action does exist then i 'm guessing there is no-one around who would want to sue hence the police decided it was ok . 
  why are you saying that ? 
  you must be a terrorist !, 
  raise the drawbridge !, 
  i would consider throwing in the towel if i could live somewhere with barbecue places lining the streets , maybe texas provided i could avoid [ actual texans ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_296w/2010-2019/washingtonpost/2012/01/28/outlook/advance/images/2012-01-17t191223z_01_jey919_rtridsp_3_usa-campaign-perry-32183.jpg?uuid=nb8jrelqeeg6les1wwnstw ) . 
  i hear austin is fairly cool . 
  i 've lived there 2 years now and ca n't imagine living anywhere else . 
  i just got back from holiday en france and got that ` home sweet home ' feeling when i got back . 
  different people like different things i guess . 
  it clearly not for everyone but it 's for me . 
   less intrusive eu environmental law i do n't think that would be true . 
  germany 's electricity already comes largely from renewable sources . 
  the only reason germany might not be too concerned about green laws is because they already have those laws in place nationally . 
   young , two humped animal ?? 
  [ that species of camel has one hump . 
  the euro is only a problem while there is a crisis . 
  when you need flexibility the euro ca n't give it to you . 
  obvious as a flaw that is fatal or at least fatal until we have a banking union but if the eurozone improved tomorrow most of the euro 's problems would go away which means there is a danger that when this crisis eventually blows over people might just forget about the problems . 
  looks like they 'll be buying a new hard drive . 
  yeah . 
  yeah , i liked that . 
  well played . 
  iirc this is a textbook breach of european law and already decided by the [ angonese case ] ( http://www.biicl.org/files/1839_c-281-98.pdf ) . 
  you ca n't oraganise your qualifications system so as to exclude people purely based on where they 're from . 
  but then there may be more to this story than is obvious . 
  sky is partly owned by rupert murdock . 
  could you post the link here if you do repost ? 
  i 'd be interested in their responses . 
  while i mostly agree with you , saying something is ` probably ' true then drawing a sweeping conclusion is almost always a bad idea . 
  that 's how people end up making huge leaps in their heads and start believing unjustifiable things . 
  it 's not a very intelligent way of thinking . 
  depends what you mean by ` your own interests ' . 
  no sane person want 's a terrorist state in north africa least of all the malian people . 
  our interests align . 
  i ca n't blame them to be honest . 
  there 's nothing wrong with public debate but hollande and merkel have every right to send a message to cameron that they wo n't play his fake eurosceptic game . 
  then again if they just gave a little bit and gave him enough credibility in europe to win back eurosceptic voters rather than them deserting to a genuine eurosceptic party they could wait it out until the next election when labour will come in and probably be a lot more co-operative . 
  british politics may be pretty guttural but it 's their problem too , just like all our political landscapes are each other 's problems . 
  if we 're a union it does mean engaging at least somewhat in each others domestic politics even if it is childish . 
  [ i hope you 've all seen this one . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5qwkewo4bc ), 
  [ yes , it was on qi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4opfga8uj4c#t=183s ), 
  boom !, 
  work the body , left hook , upper cut !, 
  i was hoping this would be some positive economic news ... i 've been deceived . 
  well while it obviously has a lot to do with business relations with saudi arabia it 's probably also to do with the fact that saudi has an authority and a head of state in the normal manner . 
  the taliban was basically a rebel group that found itself in control of a country and those sort of rogue nations with no political pressures on their leadership is a bit scary . 
  non-the-less the us went to afghanistan to get osama bin laden and stayed because they kept getting shot at . 
  afghanistan does not have any oil afaik so the two are not overly comparable . 
  iraq is also different in that saddam had committed crimes against humanity where as saudi has not . 
  the business aspect is one parallel with iraq however . 
  msnbc is the only vaguely left wing media source in tv and most papers are less biased than news outlets but all are right wing economically and most right wing in their news . 
  the nation and mother jones are the only widely read left wing publication i have come across regularly ( not being from the us myself ) . 
  afghanistan - yes , the taliban were sheltering people who had arguably committed an act of war against the us and the regime itself was an affront to the civilised world anyway and was guilty of various human rights abuses . 
  iraq - i do n't know . 
  there 's no doubt that the case for war based on wmd etc was bogus and wishful thinking . 
  but they were wishing to fix the mistake they made in the 90 's which was not to get rid of saddam then and there when he had invaded kuwait and after he had committed genocide against the kurds and invaded iran . 
  [ here is a description ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr1x3zv6x5y ) of how he gained power and it 's telling ; the guy was [ a sadistic killer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_saddam_hussein's_iraq ) and leaving him in power only allowed him to become more radical after the war and to treat rebellions ( encouraged but crucially unsupported by the us ) with brutal torture and the [ us was criticised for not intervening ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_iraq#u.s._non-intervention_controversy ) at that point . 
  then they intervene and get called war-hungry etc. 
  you have to accept that iraq is better off now he is gone . 
  i think an intervention could have been justified purely on humanitarianism and crimes against humanity but clearly gwb et al did n't think so and they felt they needed to concoct a new story from very sketchy evidence instead .
