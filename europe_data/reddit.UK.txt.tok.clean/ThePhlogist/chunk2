  an economic crash is not going to affect someone who is not part of the economic system . 
  people who are not part of the economic system often do not have access to education , prophylactics nor do they even know if their one child will survive to adulthood so they have more . 
  you ca n't really compare the two situations . 
  your ignorant comment aside , he was talking about germans specifically who have access to birth control . 
  that must be john oliver . 
  he does a podcast with another comedian in the uk and it 's a running joke on the podcast that the only thing belgians eat is waffles and the only commodity traded on the belgium stock exchange is waffle batter etc etc. 
  [ here 's an example . 
  start at 21:40 ] ( http://www.gamesplusone.com/thebugle/thebugle148.mp3 ), 
   think the daily mail i ca n't express how happy i am that the daily mail has become a synonym for poor journalism on reddit . 
  i 'm mostly happy because it 's true and they need to get some consequences for the shit they write . 
  judging by the headline ( which admittedly was translated from slovakian ) i think this was a tabloid sensationalist paper . 
   total mockery live on the air like you 've never seen !, 
  please . 
  this just feels like bullshit ` news ' that 's just aimed at making people angry . 
  we need some slovakians in here to confirm . 
  the eu need to talk to russia , surely , of it wa n't to deal with the situation . 
  i hear this a lot : europe needs to defend it 's neighbourhood . 
  what is our neighbourhood ? 
  the eu ? 
  the eu + the rest of the eastern bloc ? 
  the eu + eastern block + the balkans ? 
  what about the middle east ? 
  or north africa ? 
  frankly i do n't see it as our responsibility to have any interest in the middle east or africa unless they pose a direct threat through terrorism . 
  i can see the argument for defending the eastern bloc or the balkans but an attack from russia would be catastrophic for russia and they would gain very little they do n't already have through soft power . 
  even if the worst came to the worst europe 's military spending combined is much more than russia 's and defence would not be as big a problem as this author makes out . 
  on the naval front the uk will have two aircraft carriers when they 're built and a fleet of new jets to put on them . 
  france has one , italy has two and spain ... has decommissioned it 's carrier ... but still russia has only one compared to our 5 . 
  i ca n't think of any power in the atlantic that could threaten europe 's trade routes . 
  piracy is also being combated very successfully by european ships . 
  besides you do n't need a huge standing army to deal with low level terrorism which is our most likely threat . 
  the french army are disarming rebels in the car with 1600 guys . 
  they defended mali with a few thousand also . 
  libya was done with no ground troops what so ever . 
  if iraq and afghanistan has taught us anything it 's that sometimes large scale military occupations raise more problems than they solve . 
  maintaining small highly trained armies will suffice for all of europe 's needs . 
  intelligence , logistics and air support are things that could be shared . 
  they are all tasks that do n't put lives in very much risk and thus countries are more willing to it for each other . 
  we already see this happening today . 
  europe can afford the reduction in militaries in defence of ourselves . 
  if nato wants the uk or whoever to project military power across the globe we should leave it because it would not be in our best interests . 
  ** tl ; dr ** europe faces very few threats and those it does have could be defeated with small highly trained armies and co-operation on transport , intelligence etc. 
  nato can suck a dick . 
  edit : spelyng, 
  it is and was also in a less precarious economic position . 
  whereas greece had a national debt of 169 % / gdp but the uk is on about half that . 
  greece is still in recession where as the uk is exceeding growth forecasts . 
  the uk can afford to be a little more restrained in it 's timetabling . 
  george osborne says he 'll have the economy in budget surplus by 2015/16 . 
  whether you believe him is another matter . 
  and it 's been called off as a result . 
  took me until 2 minutes until the end to realise they might have included russia . 
  we understood your aspersions the first time . 
  some of those are surprisingly accurate ( 80-90 % ) . 
  i doubt too many people from western europe would be able to get estonia , lithuania and latvia in order . 
  that 's always what gets me . 
  you need to put an 's ' after the seconds number when you add a time for the video to start . 
  i wonder what david cameron mp circa 2009 would have thought about 2013 david cameron . 
  i guess [ ` nick clegg looking sad ' would be one . 
  ] ( http://nickclegglookingsad.tumblr.com/ ) nick clegg is our deputy prime minister if anyone was wondering ... and he 's not very well liked . 
  banks fund the extra industry in the uk . 
  traders specifically might benefit but he rest if the financial industry will lose out . 
  the uk is not a small guy , he 's quite large but he 's just the wrong guy . 
  merkel is in a very good negotiating position with cameron in a way she possibly is not with obama . 
  cameron needs her co-operation as his next election campaign will focus around getting reform in the eu to limit law making power . 
  if he ca n't get any reforms from merkel he will have to admit defeat and may lose the referendum he has promised uk businesses he will win . 
  all she needs to say is that if gchq get the fuck out of germany then maybe they can organised a little good pr for cameron . 
  google it . 
  a book could be written on that question alone : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20448450 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/what-if-britain-left-the-eu-7904469.html http://www.ibtimes.com/brexit-if-britain-quits-eu-what-then-1106522 http://www.grant-thornton.co.uk/en/thinking/fd-intelligence/issues/what-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu--the-business-impact/ ** pdf download ** [ here is a parliamentary research paper on the subject ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0cegqfjac&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.parliament.uk%2fbriefing-papers%2frp13-42.pdf&amp;ei=gpr3uorfnubr7abnvycwda&amp;usg=afqjcnfefawo9gjb9vbjz27al9kkdr5fhq&amp;sig2=jyws_lsjudza8m9p1mytlq&amp;bvm=bv.55819444,d.zgu ) . 
  and here 's a good summary quote :  as to whether uk citizens would benefit from leaving the eu , this would depend on how the uk government of the day filled the policy gaps left by withdrawal from the eu . 
  in some areas , the environment , for example , where the uk is bound by other international agreements , much of the content of eu law would probably remain . 
  in others , it might be expedient for the uk to retain the substance of eu law , or for the government to remove eu obligations from uk statutes . 
   ...  although the eu treaty provides in article 50 for a member state to withdraw from the eu , an eu-exit would not be straightforward and would involve complex and probably lengthy negotiations over the uk 's future relations with the eu . 
  the extent to which uk and other eu citizens might have vested rights stemming from the uk 's eu membership would have to be addressed . 
   the uk might seek to rejoin the european free trade area ( efta ) and remain in the european economic area ( eea ) in order to benefit from the single market . 
  ** this would mean a continuation of free movement of people , capital , goods and services . 
  ** alternatively , it might decide to go it alone like switzerland ( which is in efta , but not the eea ) and negotiate bilateral agreements with the eu on a case-by-case basis . 
  whatever the arrangement , there is likely to be a trade-off between the level of access to the single market , and freedom from eu product regulations , social and employment legislation , and budgetary contributions . 
   the uk , through its eu membership , is party to many treaties with third countries , mainly , but not entirely , concerning trade . 
  these would need to be renegotiated to take account of uk withdrawal . 
  there would be specific repercussions for scotland ( complicated by uncertainty over whether it remains part of the uk ) , wales and northern ireland , particularly with regard to eu regional funding . 
   the implications of a uk withdrawal would be greater in areas such as agriculture , trade and employment than they would in , say , education or culture . 
  the future financing of the eu has been planned on the basis of continuing uk membership and there would almost certainly be long and complicated negotiations to settle the financial account between the uk and the eu . 
  the overall economic impact of the uk withdrawing from the eu is difficult to predict . 
  this is partly because many of ** the costs and benefits of membership are subjective , diffuse or intangible ** , and partly because a host of assumptions must be made about the terms on which the uk would depart the eu , and how the government would fill the policy vacuum left in areas where the eu currently has competence . 
  the emphasis is mine . 
  i would advise reading as much of this paper as you can because it 's very detailed and considers a lot of other research . 
  edit : alternatively [ here is a copy of the entire treaty on the functioning on the european union ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0cc4qfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2feur-lex.europa.eu%2flexuriserv%2flexuriserv.do%3furi%3doj%3ac%3a2010%3a083%3a0047%3a0200%3aen%3apdf&amp;ei=7ft3uumnns-qhqfhpydicw&amp;usg=afqjcnhl2migqycwfrb55z-50ogpxddadw&amp;sig2=kpvgb-ikvhda3_pr8et71g&amp;bvm=bv.55819444,d.zg4 ) . 
  in 150 pages you will know exactly how the eu is run and what powers it has and you can decide that for yourself . 
  his voters are all older people with no friends outside of britain and who do n't leave the country . 
  nothing he says makes any sense for young people and he just seems so keen to alienate them all the more . 
  support is not wafer thin among young brits , in fact , [ a large majority would vote to stay in : ~ 65 % ] ( http://www.social-europe.eu/2013/01/new-poll-young-brits-want-to-stay-in-the-eu/ ) . 
  i think it is possible to win an in-out referendum but there is a big danger that the the out campaign could use a scatter-gun strategy where they throw out so many false and untrue statements that the in campaign has to take it 's time to correct each one and ends up coming across badly never actually making an argument . 
  referendums are ok on the whole but it does n't really work when one side is full of serial liers and a dishonest press all while the british public is not informed enough to see through the lies . 
  yeah , perhaps . 
  the government has been elected though ; in the uk system it seems to generally accepted that the government is free to govern without much interference . 
  the house of lords is realistically no obstacle to laws passing so as long as your party has a majority in the house of commons you can pass any law . 
  with 30-40 % you can get most things passed without too much trouble provided it 's not totally abhorrent to the other party . 
  if we have problems with the system they often arise from the government being too free to do things we do n't like than the government being unable to do anything at all ( like the us congress for instance ) . 
  besides it does n't happen a whole lot .
