  it will only occur when the bill aims to removes some of the these royal powers that the government can now use . 
  if it does n't concern one of those powers they ca n't use the veto . 
  they ca n't veto a law about political rights or education or healthcare or defence or any of that stuff because none of it affects those royal powers . 
  edit : ok here 's a very limited and vague list of prerogative powers . 
  it 's very difficult to define the scope if these powers because they are merely defined as the powers that have n't been taken the monarch already from the days when monarchs were absolute :  the issuing and withdrawal of passports   the appointment and dismissal of government ministers   the appointment of queen 's counsel ( very senior lawyers )   the granting of honours  the appointment and regulation of the civil service  the commissioning of officers in the armed forces  the dissolution of parliament  the calling of elections  the declaration of war and deployment of troops abroad  the making of treaties  the recognition of foreign states  the accreditation of diplomats all these things are technically royal powers but are in fact exercised by the government . 
  vetos can only be used if a law covers one of these issues . 
  these vetos are over laws that concern the royals themselves . 
  charles does not have any general veto power . 
  the queen has a general veto power on all laws but no monarch has used that veto since 1708 . 
  if it were to be used to today i would need to be at the advise of politicians . 
  their personal veto on laws which effect them is more commonly used but almost always at the advise of ministers . 
  in the case of the military action against iraq ( parliamentary approval ) bill , it would have taken away the ability for the queen to engage in military action without parliamentary consent . 
  nowadays obviously that power is exercised by the prime minister as are the vast majority of royal powers . 
  in libya david cameron used it to send the raf without a vote in parliament and there was debate about syria too before they conceded to having a vote . 
  the queen vetoed it on the advise of ministers , i.e she was told to by the government because they did n't want to lose their ability to bomb people without asking anyone . 
  i understand your concerns with the euro however i fail to see a future where the uk outside of the euro has it 's economic policy dictated to it by eurozone countries . 
  we have broadly remained out of contributing to bailouts of eurozone countries . 
  we did not need permission to do this nor will we need permission to opt out of federalising movements in the future . 
  it 's worth remembering the most germans do not want a federal europe and yet they are supporting the euro with all their might . 
  there not reason why there can not be created a 2 tier europe with eurozone countries in the centre with integrated financial policies and everyone out side that with competency of their own . 
  nothing prevents this in theory and in fact i find a federal eurozone unlikely too for the simple reason that it does not have political approval and world leaders are not so naive as to accidentally find themselves in a new federal nation - were they to realise that some would pull out immediately - i just ca n't see it happening . 
  on the bankers bonuses i do n't think it is entirely clear the eu does have competency over pay in private companies - in fact setting pay is specifically excluded from eu competence in the treaty . 
  the eu 's social policy states everyone should be treated fairly in terms of working conditions , chance of promotion etc but under s. 153 it says :  ` the provisions of this article shall not apply to pay , the right of association , the right to strike or the right to impose lock-outs ' . 
  the uk is launching a legal challenge and i honestly think they might win and the ecj will strike down the law . 
  the justification is very sketchy but just because the parliament passed it does not mean they have competency - the ecj may rule that they exceeded their powers . 
  http://www.lewissilkin.com/en/journal/2013/september/lifting-the-lid-on-the-bonus-cap.aspx#.unbx2_nwaso if the public wants to know what power the eu has they can read the [ treaty on the functioning of the european union ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:c:2010:083:0047:0200:en:pdf ) . 
  it may be 150 boring pages but it includes every power the eu has . 
  it 's well defined , hotly debated and closely studied . 
  i know the public does not know but nothing is being hidden ; the public just simply does not care enough apparently . 
  i ca n't see how this is chipping away at our democracy when the banker 's bonus law ( illegal as it may or may not be ) was passed by meps voted for by people in the uk and the rest of the eu . 
  what people sometimes mean when making similar arguments is that they do n't like the idea that the uk may be legally bound by an obligation voted for by other nations but opposed by us . 
  this objection is not to the eu necessarily but to international law in general . 
  i find the benefits of intentional laws including eu law outweigh the negatives . 
  nor do i think that politicians and business leaders are keen to give away powers according to no logic . 
  the eu has a specific purpose and an end goal - to create a single market where the rules in trade an industry are the same throughout europe encouraging trade . 
  that 's what we signed up to and the eu requires a finite number of powers as are required to achieve this finite aim . 
  it 's not a case of trading rights of citizens to improve business - every competency the eu has is given to improve business by unifying regulations in one way or another . 
  the idea that the eu will suddenly throw off it 's shackles and start consuming powers it does n't want , never asked for and wo n't use is mostly exaggeration . 
  edit : also worth mentioning that part of the eu 's justification for the bonus cap was that it was not setting a pay level but merely setting a ration between salary and bonus . 
  salary can be whatever they like but bonuses awarded on the basis of risk taking make up a smaller part of that pay check encouraging more sensible behaviour . 
  of course it can , this was never a question of can or ca n't . 
  the uk would probably be more or less fine outside of the eu . 
  but the benefit to ceding some sovereignty is that the eu uses that sovereignty which we all give to universalise much of the rules and regulations regarding what i 'm free to do within the eu . 
  i 'm free to travel , live , work , retire , buy property , transfer capital and raise a family in another eu country and i will be treated as a native . 
  i have the freedom ( within reason ) to enjoy other people 's countries and they have the freedom ( within reason ) to enjoy ours . 
  i value that not just higher than the ` cost ' of losing sovereignty ( which i do n't estimate to be at all high in value btw ) but orders of magnitude more valuable . 
  what we get out of the eu is , for me and in my experience , of much much greater value than what we put in in terms of membership costs and the loss of sovereignty . 
  it should also be pointed out that the ` loss of sovereignty ' is not total in most cases . 
  in most cases directives are used not regulations . 
  this means the eu sets out the aims of legislation to be passed and it is up to the member state to write the law how ever they want . 
  it may go further or be worded totally differently but it must achieve the aims . 
  this gives member states lots of freedom to decide the way the law is implemented and how wide it may go . 
  the more sensitive the issue the more often directives are used . 
  you may disagree but i would like to understand what value you put on keeping total sovereignty in areas of trade and industry and why you think it 's more valuable than the ability to use the whole eu for work , life and , of course , play . 
  also , what is your view on the wto , the un , nato or the commonwealth of nations . 
  all these organisations necessarily involve some sort of sacrifice of sovereignty in that there are rules which constrain how we act or force obligations on us even if this is only to pay membership fees . 
  is all this loss of sovereignty bad or is some of it good ? 
  is it merely the case that the eu takes too much sovereignty and if so how much is too much ? 
  what line did the eu cross to mean they took too much sovereignty ? 
  readers does n't equal supporters . 
  they currently have 6697 signatures on their petition which is around 0.0001 of the population and 1 % of their readers . 
  people are more than willing to complain and moan but when it comes to actually doing something , even something so effortless as signing a petition , they do n't actually bother . 
  in my experience people like to think radically and believe there is a simple answer that can be executed by a straight talking , confident politician . 
  people love being told to feel a certain way and believe certain things because they feel that just by reading a certain newspaper or agreeing with certain people they are part of an ideological critical mass will solve whatever problem they see in their country . 
  they believe , maybe subconsciously , that their mere participation can provide support to men of action who will argue this ideology in parliament and it will provide unity once everyone is persuaded of the same thing . 
  it 's this idea that nominally being part of a movement is enough to actually help that movement that encourages people to subscribe to extreme ideas . 
  there 's no risk of failure or of responsibility but all the possibility of creating a new utopia ( left wing radicalism ) or defending/re-creating an old utopia you think has been lost ( right wing radicalism ) . 
  it 's a very interesting psychological phenomenon imo . 
  and yet when people are presented with real ethical problems and they have to understand that real human beings are affected by the enthusiastic ` men of action ' , ideology can so quickly be thrown out of the window and empathy takes over . 
  as long as people are separated by a newspaper front page or by their tv cable news that ensures they do n't have to do the hard part of thinking about consequences and how they would feel in the same situation they do n't care . 
  they 'll consume and financially support xenophobic nonsensical nasty material and by proxy support the people who created it . 
  when asked to actually practice what they preach or when they are presented with the results of their comrades ideas their piety often wanes . 
  luckily most people are intelligent enough and have enough of an appreciation of history to know that it 's not worth investing anything valuable of yours into an idea that you have n't fully thought through . 
  so they stick with reading their newspapers and ** believing ** because they ca n't lose . 
  in reality the people that buy the daily express , the daily mail and the telegraph ( but also the more fervent left wing publications like the new statesman ) in huge numbers when they go on these silly campaigns and print these over-the-top sensationalist headlines are the believers . 
  they 're the people who have n't got the time , motivation or knowledge to fully understand the ideology that 's being presented and they know it . 
  they are intelligent enough that they will never actually risk anything to protect this ideology but it feels good to be part of a crowd who 's radical and consistent with no difficult questions or conclusions . 
  you can have an hour of snorting anger over breakfast ( but feel your on the correct side ) and get on with your day without by action on your part . 
  these are not people we need to worry about . 
  the only danger is that they vote people who are are willing to risk something ( including the happiness and well being of the rest of us ) in pursuit of their extreme ideas . 
  i 'm glad that in general people are willing to say ' i do n't know ' rather than jumping on the bandwagon so i do n't think this is a major problem provided an alternative narrative is presented in the media . 
  if people 's consistent stream of ideology is interrupted by someone who can actually make sense they are much less suggestible . 
  also do n't get me wrong , there are many clever , careful and thoughtful people that read these newspapers and many do n't agree with the way the paper goes about them . 
  they may want some sort of debate but not such an extreme one . 
  that 's obviously excellent and those people are not who i 'm talking about . 
  then again they are n't the people the daily express want 's to sign their petition either . 
  / essay ** tl ; dr ** people are oh so ready to consume extreme ideas but none of them are willing to act on it and as such they pose no threat to anyone . 
  so wait , let me get this straight . 
  the phone calls collected from france and spain were not from french and spanish people but were calls from countries that were/are war-zones collected by european spy agencies then given voluntarily to the nsa ? 
  i 'm not sure i ever read the le monde article but was the implication not that these were phone calls of french people ? 
  also if the above is true the bugging of the phones of european leaders is another issue , yes ? 
  if so who did that , the spy agencies in those countries or the nsa ? 
  mostly because they admit they do n't know enough about the issue to make a decision . 
  i 'd rather that than 20 % of the population voting one way or the other not knowing what they 're voting for . 
  how many is ` quite a few people ' ? 
  whoever these people are they must never watch tv , listen to radio , talk about politics to other people or indeed travel to any other countries . 
  are these people even going to know the referendum is happening ? 
  from seeing the guy who introduced the bill and his super cool beard i could guess that almost immediately . 
  seems like an optimistic shot in the dark . 
  even so it 's interesting how one would affect the other .
