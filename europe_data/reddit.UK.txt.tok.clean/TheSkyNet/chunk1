  how come ? 
  id like to see more about exit poals, 
  and then a crater by 2016 . 
  it 's all fun and games till someone loses a country . 
  well i like making fun of both sides . 
   times of israel publishes op-ed about ` when genocide is permissible ' , then deletes it isnt  ( huffingtonpost.com ) times of israel publishes op-ed about ` when genocide is permissible ' , then deletes it ( i 'm posting it here , since r/worldnews deleted it as `` editorialized '' , despite that i left the title intact ) ( huffingtonpost.com ), 
  nope im a web developer, 
  yes as soon as we know all the stuff we will make one . 
  i do n't have the full list yet , but by testing we know the uk , russian serbian ips are n't getting added if its a bug or not we dont know yet . 
  so i was gon na do mod post and let you all in on what 's going on , not all european places are in on this . 
  the mod team is waiting on information , and we have policies in place to help . 
  happy to q&a, 
  i 'd love to hear thoughts on this because i ca n't think of a way to make it work . 
  * it hard enough just communicating internally . 
  * this is a unpayed `` job '' . 
  * we are continually being raided by all sorts of groups . 
  are some of the problems we have as a mod team . 
  send us a mod email ? 
  i dont think that 's a good idea.do it the same way we did it last time . 
  so i think this needs to be 2 posts . 
  in the uk we have a lot of local foods that sometimes even the rest of the uk does n't even know about . 
  [ eccles cake ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/eccles_cake.jpg ) and [ pease pudding ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pease_pudding ), 
  i 'm not gon na remove it completely . 
  i can put some css in action that makes the down vote button less prominent and we can add in hidden scores to for a bit see if that will work . 
  i 'm open to more suggestions . 
  but all new states are . 
  no they do n't , we did n't because we made a deal to opt out . 
  all new states must join the euro, 
  spammer . 
  this is something we can all get behind . 
  i will not pass this test . 
   nakurwi\u0107 i 'm reading that like nic-er-wic , and it sounds extremely english to me . 
  `` are you ready for a good old nickerwicking my old sport ! '', 
  gold is so useful . 
  you 'd have to pm / u/metaleks, 
  im sure the op is just joking , he had me going for a wile tho . 
  we do a milestone census on the sub every now and then . 
  there is a link to one in the top . 
   i also remember you sent this blond girl in eurovision one year and you won . 
  she was wearing a pink dress and she did a striptease on stage . 
  [ i remember this one it was craptastic .

  good idea !, 
  i 'll integrate this into the next census . 
  we will do a wiki page for them all soon , or someone can volunteer to do it . 
  there are , but that would n't involve me moving to another country . 
  that was ops question . 
  and the german shops seem to use more java and i like java . 
  english believe it or not , i 'm extremely dyslexic . 
  i really want to move to germany , i love their food and drink . 
  lots of programer jobs . 
  unfortunately i 'm bad with english , and german is like a foreign language to me .

  no , and see my other answers . 
  it was a pore choice of words on my part , but i was n't going to remove posting privileges because of it . 
   please :  1 return with an appropriate username . 
    2 do n't get involved in flame wars . 
    thank you and have a nice day . 
  is what i told him , and that 's what he came back with . 
  i often just nuke the flame war threads as they add nothing to the conversation and are a negative influence on the community . 
  i was fine with him staying in / r/europe / at the start asking why your comment was removed is always fine . 
  being a dick to the volunteer mod team is not . 
  he got a ban for being a dick in mod-mail . 
   you are a weak cunt , do you know that ? 
  that 's why he got a ban . 
  probably the guys in irc make the topics on sundays with metaleks . 
  [ come along and say hi ] ( https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/europe?nick=kiwi_ ? ), 
  yes , i did last week 's as scotland 's because the round table was about scotland this weeks is about israel so israel flag it is . 
  / / it 's now midnight so its going back to normal see you all next week . 
  well i can oley do elglais but im vrey dyzecix so i will just type gobaly gook like this , yes i do make thsi maney spelaing mistakes . 
  and you should all prase jesus that i have a spell cheker . 
  i think scotland will so well if they break from the union , i think england can cope with out her ( if not felling a bit upset ) . 
  but i hope they take us i.e rest of the uk that 's not london with them . 
   wo n't happen , the euro has far too much negative press at the moment for it to even be considered an option . 
  if you join the eu you will have to use the euro and you will join the eu . 
  i have developed lots of websites for industrial heritage sites in the uk but i always wonder why the 3 ^ rd largest number of hits come from ukraine .

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2rgtxhvpcq you need to speek leet, 
  more control by the reddit community , we used to all be on free node but most moved to snoonet . 
  i still have #reddit - europe registered but it is n't used . 
  you should post that to / r/documentaries, 
  it was n't self regulating , i was doing 6k mod actions a month and i band just as many users as i do now . 
  no one was elected the mods were nominated . 
  i chose the mods and the votes did n't count . 
  funny because last time we got yelled at for not . 
  with gems like . 
   but we emerged from both of them victorious and were allowed to expel the sudeten germans as a bonus . 
  also hitler got us rid of jews for free . 
  it 's justified . 
  one of the last pagan kingdoms .
