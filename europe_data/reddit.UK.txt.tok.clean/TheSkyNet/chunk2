  me and my friends have been celebrating australia day for the last few years , when we were first organizing i spelled it austria ( i 'm bad with words ) . 
  so every year we dress up in lederhosen and drink austrian bear and liquors . 
  it pisses of the australians because they think we are confusing them with austrians , it pisses of the austrians because they think we are confusing them with australians , and i do n't give a fuck because i 'm drunk . 
  the 1st time i went to watch eurovision was in estonia got me hooked on it . 
  if only they had the belgium dancers it would have been a sure thing . 
  i think i meant that to be a root comment , i think i 'm drunk . 
  my shoes cause me pain as well , it 's nice that this shoe pain problem is getting some international attention . 
  / int and / pol love to invade . 
  yes , removed because of this . 
  it 's going to be imposable to uphold the dpa with american web sites , i do n't think any of my customers will be able to use paypal or ups in their shops . 
  so yes you lied . 
  comments of on the internet is n't ** ever ** evidence of shit . 
  so you lied about their being evidence then ? 
  the is still no evidence . 
  noone has showed me a single thing that would even com , a close to evidence . 
  and if you ca n't provide it the why are you saying it 's there ? 
  ** its not **, 
  you 're not an dyslexic your a fucking moron . 
  not nice is it . 
  that was me back tracking ? 
  i thought it was me clarifying . 
  its one mod queue , and he is n't alone in them subs , i have 100x the actions he has . 
  probably with an rss feed and copy paste . 
  it 's not hard . 
  we have n't removed him ? 
  did n't say he was a troll slayer i said he over reacted , it happens when under pressure to everybody . 
  oddly i do n't as a mod i have a different perspective than you probably because i understand the issues involved . 
  he was worried that was the subreddit was being gamed by a troll subreddit . 
  he took action . 
  trolls targeted him by provoking then calling foul . 
  you can tell that by looking at the posting history of the band users . 
  dave overreacted you got troll into kicking him , well don you are happy about being trolled . 
  give me evidence and i will believe you . 
  i will . 
  i will kick him my self . 
  but you have none . 
  so put up or shut up . 
  yes you booted a guy for following the rules of a subreddit ... how did that accomplish anything ? 
  and is any of it true ? 
  or has evidence ? 
  the answer is no . 
  once again nothing . 
  do you know this salvaxe ? 
  he keeps tigers as pets , it must be true it 's on the internets . 
  none on them contain any evidence at all . 
  most of them are n't interesting . 
  there is hundreds of users doing this . 
  it is n't evidence of shit . 
  he was a mod for a looonnng time after that . 
  qqyh2 is also top mod in / r/technology and dave is a mod there . 
  so i think you are wrong . 
  2 . it 's one mod queue , it 's not hard . 
  he is # 3 in activity . 
   it 's what everyone wants there you go with all your 0 evidence again . 
  no just dyslexic . 
  so you are saying there is no evidence and you have no argument ? 
  ok that 's solved that then . 
  hes # 3 in actions so hes not inactive at all . 
  you can post a reddit request in / r/redditrequest, 
  ok give me some ** evidence ** just 1 piece that he is payed to submit content . 
  its not an argument you are just saying ( it is possible he is unemployed so he is getting payed to post ) . 
  it 's not an argument . 
  it 's juts evidence lacking daily mail trash talk . 
  you ca n't see why that ( it is possible he is unemployed so he is getting payed to post ) argument is a flawed argument ? 
  the argument has 0 merit , 0 evidence and 0 creditability at all . 
  it 's like saying my mate bob at the pub told me that all cats have wings so it must be true . 
  it 's not an argument . 
  it has no base in logic . 
  it has been tried multiple times , in multiple subs , it just ends up with multiple inactive mods . 
  yes it would be nice but i did n't fancy continuing to do all the work here . 
  you are ** really ** clutching at straws if that 's your hole argument . 
  i know him as a mod that is all . 
  how do you know he does n't have a job ? 
  ** and not having a job is n't evidence of shit . 
  ** your logic is as flawed as the daily mail . 
  [ his list is here btw ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/newssources?v=bd233d42-9841-11e2-9bf1-12313d1890be ), 
  i could n't spell what i was trying to spell , so it got replaced . 
  well that 's your choice we will miss your contributions to this subreddit . 
  it 's completely untrue so no , there is n't a shred of evidence to back up the allegations . 
  i 'm not going to throw someone into the trash because of some posts on the internet . 
  me and david do n't get along but he is a good , fair , knowledgeable and active mod . 
  we did we added 4 active users with little mod experience , 2 users with mod experience . 
  davidreiss666 is getting blamed for something on reddit !, 
  # 50 says it was n't him . 
  the other day he got blamed for the boston drama , he is n't even worldnews mod , this is the biggest circle jerk on reddit . 
  daily mail , sun and fox . 
  we are , and we are swapping the sun for a nice pair of tits . 
  well the first 2 are here because we ca n't remove mods above us . 
  i 'm here all the time i have over 50k actions since x-mass in this subreddit so i read it more than most . 
  and to be frank i would like some of the slack taken off my hands , that 's why we add people who are active mods . 
  we add active members of the community to represent the community , i am a member of this community and so are all of the new mods . 
  that 's confusing me more , as all of them are members of the community . 
  too late all gone , the cat got at it i swear . 
  i do n't know , i 'm very confused . 
  are you upset we did n't add a german ? 
  id link the threads , but they have n't for a wile since they found out they really ca n't . 
  / int / loves to invade as well , fools never get out of the filter . 
   i contribute a lot of submissions to the subreddit . 
  many of which have been well liked . 
  when i joined it was only you and 4 others submitting for a wile .
