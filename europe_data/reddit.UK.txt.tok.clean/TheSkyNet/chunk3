  voting is n't the best way to appoint mods on reddit , it has been tried but never ends well . 
  we looked at the votes but they were n't deciding factors . 
  welcome new mods !, 
  their both active members of this community to . 
  to be honest when i was thinking of new mods the other day your name was on my list , my only concerns were adding `` power users '' to the mod list , normally ends bad . 
  you are a brill contributor , and i think you would make a good mod . 
  timezones is n't that important as we are dead outside of the main eu timezones , but some more `` diversity '' would be nice . 
  he was the europe founder , we ca n't remove mods above us . 
  you know of my politics ? 
  because i tend to keep them to my self . 
  as long as its not me . 
  mods are n't politicians their more like the civil service . 
  that 's because we are doing a good job , but we need more hands . 
  none are truly unbiased mate . 
  spam queue for the most part , mod mail and dealing with chan invades, 
  well i 'm not user if sarcastic or not ... but i 'm going to assume the latter , so thank you . 
  99 % of the work is behind the curtain in the fillter about 100-500 actions a month in this subreddit and dealing with the mod mail . 
  but that gets dwarfed with my other subreddits like / r/technology with about 5000-10000 a month , so for the most part i 'm too bizzy to make jokes . 
  official / r/europe advice is to say you 're canadian . 
  hi this is probably going to be unpopular but i have removed this post . 
  your information is of value and although i wo n't comment on the individual accounts you have listed i will say we do have a ** massive ** problem with brigades . 
  we the mod teem do an ok job keeping them removed but there is always room to improve . 
  ** but sky why have you removed this post ? 
  ** when we call out users in public it can turn into a witch hunt fast and i do n't think we should allow that in this sub . 
  if you think that i am wrong i encourage the op to post a message to the mods . 
  -- all the best theskynet, 
  source mate, 
  im just adding the favicons , so you ? 
  ill do this tonight, 
  ner mate / u/krispykrackers is cool as fuck . 
  for me it had nothing to do with pao , i like pao , yishan told the admins to stop helping the mods . 
   it lasted long enough to make a point that was the point we do n't want reddit to suffer , we need the communication with the admins back . 
  slyratchet is never rude , he cant even say fuck or burger . 
   claims to be unbiased ? 
  where ? 
   what is the motivation of that act if r/europe [ 1 ] claims to be unbiased ? 
  where ? 
  thank you for your submission !, 
  unfortunately , it has been removed for the following reason ( s ) : bonjour !, 
  * i delisted this submission because the article 's title has been editorialised . 
  to editorialise titles is bad . 
  i invite you to resubmit this link with using the original title . 
  * * to expand a title for precising it is ok ( `` blabla -- a short text '' ) . 
  disambiguations are also ok ; for example replacing `` he did that '' by `` [ mr something ] did that '' . 
  * feel free to resubmit the content in accordance with the rules . 
  if you have any questions , please [ message the moderators ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2feurope ) . 
  we apologize for the inconvenience . 
  hi mate you need to source . 
  2.3.1 if its not in the title or the 1st line of the post it will be probably removed . 
   do you mean that i talk with logic and rationality ? 
   no the other thing . 
   what is the difference between the socialist party and the communist party ... ? 
  i 'm guessing the communists are stalinists ? 
  the communists never post outside there own sub ,, 
  mate ukip could n't even win a fake internet brexit . 
  long live the mlrp, 
  he also reported you with 5 alts , all of which have been banned, 
  tldr ; i pressed the wrong button . 
   ( i had a long reply with sources , but since a mod deleted every comment here , it would not publish and was lost . ), 
  i ca n't see it , its not in your [ profile ] ( / u/iniquest ), 
  2.3 editorialising is not acceptable . 
  editorialising if its not in the title or the 1st line of the post it will be removed . 
   and how would they address it ? 
  according to the posting , the mods do n't have access to big data tools required to identify brigading . 
  its not hard , find a fringe group of extremists , normally will have one of the following systems ; * ping / email alert system based on keywords ( political groups ) * forum / chan ( anarchists and fascists ) * irc can ( net sec nerds ) you bot them back find links and deal with them . 
  nere next week i 'm adding the all crazy mods #, 
  the mock is a shit tun of fun . 
  if you like political drama , drama drama , debating with drama nerds or just drama . 
  get your ass in . 
  jef god of biscuits . 
  keep it in one place plz, 
   i do n't understand why good people think stepping down is a smart way to handle corruption . 
  all that does is remove good people from the power structure and allow it to remain in the hands of the corrupt . 
  because doing something involves effort, 
  ok sure , the only reasons i will demod any mod is by acting unanimously with out taking other mods wishes into account , if they mod to a rule set that is n't ours , if the continuously insult/troll users they mod for self intrest . 
  * or all the other mods vote on to david , yes he is a jerk at times yes he has his opinions and yes he takes internet forums way too seriously . 
  he is an active mod and he is an one of the best at finding spam i do not favor any mod , i argue with them all . 
  although i have been told he is overly bis i have n't seen it he is quite constant in his modding style . 
   i 've always wondered : how do you know that there 's a brigade ? 
  im supper sneaky , i tend to keep most of this stuff close to hand , i do n't tell the other mods how i do it . 
  ill make a few post in the coming months about `` big busts '', 
  the new mods are getting re added as we speak, 
  well i am walking into a `` hostile '' environment , i 'm more worried about my man parts than scuffing on my decking, 
  well there brigades from time to time ; greens , ukip , pol , stopthewar , int , various pro-rus and anty-rus . 
  for the most part its controlled . 
  2.3 editorialising is not acceptable . 
  editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a ( submission ) title . 
  you should , in most cases , use the title on the page you are linking to . 
  however , in the case of youtube , you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an nonpartisan and neutral title if the one the youtube video uses is clearly partisan and bias . 
  sorted, 
  pop them in the op as well m8, 
  hi guys , this post was removed ( 4.1 ) although we allow discussion of the mod team in this case we feel that this post should be removed ; 1 we do n't feel that the accused can mount a defense . 
  2 we feel as op is a 0 day account it was a `` troll '' attempt . 
  3 we act as a team and would like to note that we monitor each others work . 
  the positives for this post remaining are ; 1 removing the post now we deliberately taking away all the content which goes with it 2 and it 's a useful and legitimate discussion . 
  ** we will work out a sensible way to address the situation soon and we have a chat going on in the back room . 
  it is currently in limbo : there is a running discussion -- among others -- about delisting it or not . 
  the posts are still published ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37yvpv/this_is_the_new_moderator_of_reurope/ ) but for the moment the thread does not appear on the subreddit . 
   2.3 editorialising is not acceptable .
