  just taking it to the other mods , should n't be to long . 
  i do n't know why , ca n't work it out . 
  some q&a from the rant box :  i hate that pizza all come with cheese on top . 
  i am allergic to cheese so i can not order a pizza or , if i can , i get something inedible . 
  i want cheese-less pizzas . 
  that 's called pizza marinara my friend , and it is probably the original pizza before the addition of mozzarella in the late 19th century . 
   wow , there should be a rant box in every questionnaire !, 
  that 's such an awesome idea - a place where people can just . . vent . 
  i know man , theskynet ideas are best ideas . 
   no , thank you , polish pizza is horrible anyway !, 
  who puts polish on pizza you strange man . 
   why ca n't we all just get along ? 
  :( i know , just what you mean man , [ just ] ( https://lygsbtd.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/zebralionhug.jpg ) [ what ] ( http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrtmhzqqkd1wv-a_nbk3jvzrkzd3l0xsunwzbopza64uxqf1fzvm4b3j4riag ) you [ mean ] ( https://lygsbtd.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/thefinger.jpg ) . 
   what sort of pizza is this , because if it has pineapple or anchovies or any other weird topping i might have to pass . 
  first because they are peculiar , second because i do not like pineapple , also what is this send button . 
  sorry mate but it has both , it was delicious to . 
   statistically speaking i\u00c2 \u00b4 m probably not going to win that pizza . 
  and that puts me in the mood for ranting !, 
  sure you are . 
  no cheating going on here mate . 
  none at all . 
   `` as a software developer , your usage of checkboxes instead of radio buttons annoys me . 
  also , i like cats . '', 
  this was my first time with google . 
  be nice . 
   `` i 'm a fucking dumb american who randomly joins / r/europe , and what do i get out of it !, 
  nothing . 
  why ca n't you socialist scumbags give me free stuff !!, 
  well you did state your country as `` the amarica '' , i think you need to work out were you are first . 
   if we live in europe , then how are we going to vote for ron paul 2012 ? 
  you did n't get the memo we are all members of the illuminati we need to keep ron paul down . 
  on note of the pizza i have been in contact with dominoes , i believe they have `` restaurants '' all over europe , just waiting to here back and we will have a massive competition coming up if we can sort out something . 
  you are n't the only one there mate , i will use all my powers to ensure the whole subreddit falls in to line . 
  i 'm doing that one at this second . 
  \\ \\ its taking longer than expected . 
  \\ \\ \\ ok so there is a problem with wild cards might take some more time .

  wrong subreddit buddy , removed . 
  yes i just got it , it was in german so i clicked the link to add you and google decided because i know a german then i must be german , and i spent the last 15 min trying to work out how not to be german . 
  i 'm doing some fancyfull things but i will set it to public so you can have a peek . 
  [ i think you can see this . 
  i would order that if it was n't # 300 for it to be delivered . 
  yep that will be fine . 
  it 's fine to put them , if it says it on your birth certificate . 
  should i do that now or towards the end ? 
  i think now might skew the results . 
  if you would like to put 2 or 3 separate them with '' , '' commas . 
  i will solve that with scripting at the end . 
  you are correct , meems are not allowed and thanks everybody for the reports . 
  we do allow some image posts sometimes we even allow comics , but not rage comics , most image submissions will go in the filter . 
  it 's funny because all acta , sopa , pipa are in the spam folder here and in technology , i 'm forever pulling them out . 
  can you give me some questions , for views on drugs and views on piracy . 
  something we can quantify ? 
   have you asked what the other people think about that ? 
  yes in all the previous mod posts . 
  down-votes do n't work , because no one uses them . 
  that 's what i was going to do ( grate minds and all that ) , thought it best to wait a while to let this thread settle down first . 
  i am very happy that the members of this subreddit are so enthusiastic, 
   do you watch the eurovision song contest yes , yes i do . 
  and love it . 
  sure i can do it over the weekend , submit questions here . 
  do n't use url shorteners . 
  well , we can do that as well . 
  removed . 
  link the article not the picture . 
  fool ... 
   sorry for my bad english . 
  it 's a lot better than mine and i 'm english . 
  is a texan not a texan , is a geordie not a geordie , is a scot not a scot . 
  it would n't be any different . 
  sorry no mean posts, 
  sorry no `` mean '' posts . 
  if i catch any one reporting links that are not spam i will ban them , it does nothing but piss me off . 
  `` publishers '' ai n't supposed to come here to promote them sylphs , reddit is not a captive audience for some seo . 
  the fact that you 're in here after i removed it from listing is very interesting to me piadina . 
  it 's odd because , you have a report but the op does n't . 
  i will take it up with the other mods if we should start removing souciant.com links . 
  for now i have removed the link . 
  nice one raerth , your lists are excellent . 
  personally i 'm fine with it , but you are probably not alone in not liking it . 
  i 'm really looking forward to the answers , remember to make a new post so it does n't get lost in the sea of posts . 
  i am removing this because it 's non english . 
  please do n't make titles like this . 
  this is spam removed, 
  it is , i think they must think that i 'm going to sensor it for them . 
  so sorry for the late reply a lot of orangereds today , i 'm not suer why some of the things get reported its a completely anonymous system , its not hard for me to re approve but its annoying . 
  i was just being ( preemptive ? ), 
  with this comment as checking for spam is hard enough as it is . 
  this is not directed at anyone in particular . 
  i would just like to point out , that the report button is for spam and rule infringements , not for things you disagree with . 
  the snp are not pro-eu at least to the best of my knowledge , but correct me if i 'm wrong .
