you got that backwards . 
  the eu has * made * the uk what it is now . 
  * the uk is an innovative motor of europe , most influential country from europe and it 's most preferred business center in a whole europe because of the eu . 
  * because of the freedom of movement . 
  and it turns out european people are not actually that interested in the uk without it . 
  my hyperbole is a personal attack , all of the sudden ? 
  are you new to the internet , or just a precious flower ? 
   the hell am i supposed to say to this ? 
  maybe you could start with explaining why the option is not viable to you and how you 'd propose to solve this issue instead . 
   ... or they vote brexit . 
  this is hardly about a bunch of old , senile grandpas from sheffield . 
  we 're talking about natural instinct . 
  animals migrate every year for food , water , to mate , sometimes tens of thousands of miles . 
  why your precious ass thinks things should be different for you is beyond me . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's how the world is , people follow the jobs and the wealth , not the other way around . 
  or are you one of the people who * choose * to sit on their ass , waiting for an opportunity to come to them ? 
  `` hey , maha-anus , you 're sitting in a pile of dog shit . 
  why do n't you wipe yourself and come sit here with us on this comfortable sofa , instead ? '', 
  `` alright , suit yourself . '', 
  `` hey guys !, 
  why do you get to sit on a sofa and i have to sit in a pile of shit ? 
  it 's not fair ! '', 
  like you said , you * choose * to remain . 
  you can also leave if you choose to do so . 
  exactly . 
  while this is more of a `` where 's my money , bitch ? '', 
  type of situation . 
  this is like refusing to pay your phone bill anymore because you lost your phone . 
  britain * does * owe the money , after all . 
  lol . 
  that 's not how * protection money * works , seriously . 
  and i completely understand why . 
  it 's 2017 , populism is the new communism and we all know how we all feel about communists . 
  young people are connected with the whole world 24/7 , they can see it , they want to experience it , they want freedom of movement , they do n't want to live and die on the same stupid rock . 
  and you dare to tell them that they ca n't because of some stupid rules which are not even relevant to them , anymore ? 
  nobody else feels like that . 
  it 's the world vs the uk , and britain is gon na be made example of . 
  hard . 
  really . 
  because reading between the lines i see that this sub does n't want britain to fail , it simply does not care whether it succeeds . 
  as for what the eu wished to accomplish after brexit - nothing . 
  when the pound goes down and the majority of international talent leaves , britain no longer has anything to offer . 
  british exports matter to britain way more than they matter to the eu and most of them are services . 
  when the people providing these services leave the uk , what 's left ? 
  oh , i 'm sorry , let me try ... [ europeans like the e.u. 
  more since brexit . 
  even the british ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hkvn1/europeans_like_the_eu_more_since_brexit_even_the/ ) [ nicola sturgeon says scotland sees its future as part of eu as brexit confirmed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pla7u/nicola_sturgeon_says_scotland_sees_its_future_as/ ) [ revealed : how us billionaire helped to back brexit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5w99p5/revealed_how_us_billionaire_helped_to_back_brexit/ ) [ samsung snubs london in favour of berlin because it 's ` not a fun place to live unless you are really rich ' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mtufy/samsung_snubs_london_in_favour_of_berlin_because/ ) all i 'm seeing is people not taking any of britain 's shit anymore and treating it like the spoiled baby it is . 
  then you should seriously work on your reading comprehension . 
  though i do understand that `` strong and stable '' is much easier to comprehend than `` european court of justice ( ecj ) must have jurisdiction to guarantee citizens ' rights . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  just like brits hate nice wine , good beer , tasty fruits and vegetables , delicious continental breads , quality cheeses ... 
  so it 's not the same product . 
  i hate to break it to you you but unless the packaging is * identical * it is clearly a similar product made by the same company for another market . 
  staropramen does exactly the same thing with their exports . 
  different label , different beer ; mainly because most brits ca n't handle any real flavour . 
  edit : i 'm gon na piggy back on this one and add that you also pay about 75p ( 50p on sale ) for a bottle of budweiser budvar while it costs us at least # 1.89 ( or maybe # 1.50 on sale ) so ... 
  given the benefit of doubt and the fact that it was obviously taken by an amateur that looks very close to the promo picture , to be honest . 
  or do you expect fresh fruit in every spoonful of your yogurt , too ? 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://globalnews.ca/news/2049024/advertising-vs-real-life-why-the-food-we-eat-doesnt-look-like-food-in-the-pictures/ ) edit-edit : mods would not let me link to buzzfeed . 
  can you see this now ? 
  tell me more . 
  or is that just a bulgarian thing ? 
  but what if add smell of potato ? 
  surely comrade would not ad real potato in wash , no ? 
  also , we 're arguing about fish fingers - a highly processed , breadcrumbed , fried fish . 
  they 're really bad for you in one form of another . 
  that 's absolutely not the point . 
  what he 's doing is either intentionally or unintentionally misleading . 
  it 's like comparing a model in real life and on a cover . 
  i know you believe you have a point but this is not objective therefore irrelevant . 
  you do understand you 're comparing a promotional image with a blurry picture somebody took with their phone . 
  oh , shut up ; i was being facetious . 
  also , since you seem to be a little confused about history and geography , watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iha3os8shys ) short video . 
  just for shits and giggles . 
  one would think you 'd know better , given finland 's historic relationship with the russian empire . 
   tell me why should n't i move to a country where a germanic language is spoken and i will consider prague . 
  edit : if you ca n't understand my gibberish , here is my attempt to paraphrase the comment : tell me why i wanted to say something with the meaning of `` tell me why '' . 
  should n't i move to i wanted to say something with the meaning of `` i should not move to '' . 
  a country where a germanic language is spoken i wanted to say something with the meaning of `` a country where a germanic language is spoken '' . 
  those countries are these ones ( the ones in dark blue ) . 
  and i wanted to say something with the meaning of `` and '' . 
  i will consider prague i wanted to say something with the meaning of `` i will consider the city known as prague as a possible destination to move to '' then you 're just way too passive aggressive and ca n't really be taken seriously . 
  i honestly ca n't tell whether you 're being serious or just fucking with me . 
  forget your broken english , that 's like the mildest sarcasm i 've seen . 
  that sentence makes no sense . 
  it 's either `` tell me , * why should n't i * move to a country where a germanic language is spoken ? '' ( which you ca n't follow by `` and i will consider prague . '' `` - implying you are planing on moving to prague , and that you are aware they speak the languages , asking the person to change your mind . 
  ( because two germanic languages are widely spoken there ) . 
  or `` * tell me why i should/shouldn ` t * move to a country where a germanic language is spoken and i will consider prague . '' - implying that you do n't know they speak the languages and asking for advice whether to move or not . 
  either way , they do speak germanic languages and the sentence structure is just plain wrong making it pretty much incomprehensible . 
  then it 's gibberish and you should do better . 
  the joke was lost on you , after all ? 
  they 're fine with it , as long as you 're white or east asian , fairly rich and attractive ; but not eastern european . 
  :-) see ? 
  it 's easy . 
  german and english are both very widely spoken in prague . 
  as for the negative ... are you sure you meant to say `` tell me why should n't i '' ? 
  maybe spellcheck , first , next time ? 
  do n't tell me , you 're one ugly-ass son of a bitch edgelord . 
  if you mean `` melania '' then no , she 's * slovenian * . 
  ivana was/is czech , by origin .
