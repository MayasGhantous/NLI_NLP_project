russian rublette, 
  just burn some of all that money you own to keep warm . 
  i 've just never heard of the stagnation before and wanted to read up on it not going to debate it though , too much effort on something that could change rapidly with a major event ( war , leaving the eu etc. ), 
  excellent . 
  thank you, 
  do you have a source on the 10 years of stagnation please ? 
  i 'd like to read it, 
  so this is how ww3 starts . 
  that man has balls, 
  we 're a silly bunch after all . 
  later than that usually . 
  in my group if we 're going clubbing/pub crawling it 's pre-drinks in small groups at 8-10pm , then everyone in our large social circle meet at the first stop at 10.30 and for the next few hours we drag our drunken carcasses around town destroying our livers . 
  the night usually ends around 3-5am where we split off and crash at each other 's flats for the night . 
  edit : note that this is what we do on our homeland . 
  the few people i 've been on holiday with in europe usually do n't have more than a few drinks so not to harass the locals . 
  we understand that drunken british tourists are worse than the nazis . 
  you 've been taught well by the looks of it !, 
  a night with an extremely drunk brit is either a really good night or absolutely terrible unfortunately all our tourist expats tend to fit in the latter category . 
  i blame greenland for this myself . 
  you guys had a lot of kings named louis . 
   has anybody been sentenced yet ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 'll probably be front page news when they are though . 
  i 'm sure the people trying to vote to change romania from the `` dump '' ( his words , not mine ) status appreciated the sentiment . 
  white flag is the flag for surrendering nowadays . 
  guess what ( incorrect ) stereotype the french are known for, 
  they can take our nike but they will never take our adidas !, 
  if you 're lucky you might find someone wearing the elusive and prestigious tracksuit in some parts of the uk, 
  i hope things work out for them . 
  they can kindly go join the so called jihadists with `` good intentions '' if that 's the way they feel . 
  it 's this kind of thought that let the raping of rotherham happen . 
  thank you based wales, 
  anyone got the statistics for eastern poland ? 
  my father in law , psychotherapist and my son all pressured me into investing and i want to know if i made the right decision, 
  no you 're correct . 
  most people think of indians , pakistanis etc. 
  when asians are mentioned in the uk . 
  if people mention east asians then we usually think of china and hong kong first . 
  we very rarely get korean and japanese people here, 
  yeah this whole fiasco came as the exact wrong time . 
  it feels like england is going to be joining ireland and belgium on the ` paedophile jokes ' bench soon, 
  well yes . 
  but i 'd rather have more of my tax money trying to stop a disease that could spiral out of control than have it potentially infect europe . 
  funniest video i 've seen all week, 
  remember kids , do n't do ~ ~ drugs ~ ~ soviets !, 
  haha no problem mate . 
  everyone makes mistakes, 
  wow . 
  maybe that will teach security to pick up the slack, 
  there are many things said about poland , but in modern history evil is not one of them of course my original comment was dripping with * hilarious * sarcasm, 
  cameron 's scared of losing votes to ukip so i doubt he 'll listen too much . 
  i agree completely . 
  unfortunately it 's going to lead us into some trouble sometime in the future, 
  wait you mean they 're * not * out to get us ? 
  colour me shocked, 
  ** noooo ** how are we going to keep up our image of being the bad guy in the eu when stuff like this happens ? 
  on a more serious note , congratulations to the scientists and neurosurgeons in this operation . 
  hopefully this will lead to more disabled people being able to live easier lives . 
  i think barroso is doing more harm than good with these comments unfortunately, 
  everywhere needs doctors these days . 
  you 'll easily find a job in ireland i 'd bet . 
  now that poland has moved up in the world we need new plumbers . 
  any takers ? 
  so wait this guy was the first person to be charged with this law ? 
  is there are particular reason why ? 
  why do you think ukip popularity is gaining ? 
  i 'm not a supporter of ukip but when none of the current parties listen to your wishes then you start looking for another party to vote for . 
  i wonder how many people thought of poland , romania and bulgaria in the first question and then thought of germany , france , spain and scandinavia in the second . 
  such is life, 
  lmao who pissed in your cornflakes this morning ? 
  shhhhhh do n't break the uk is bad circlejerk we are all literally poodles . 
  all of us . 
  never . 
  we exist purely to annoy the continentials, 
  leds not make this into another pun thread, 
  please make it italy ; _ ;, 
  it 's like he 's trying to get scotland and france to reform the auld alliance, 
  it 's not really backwards mate . 
  rural and catholic yeah but not backwards . 
  maybe he should go back to his stores and leave politics to the professionals . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ politicians ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ ^ professional ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ still, 
  bloody foreigners . 
  coming here , taking our humour ... 
  bravo !, 
  it 's like living in texas when you do n't like the confederate supporting gun nuts there . 
  you 're being proud of being american and you 're proud of being texan , but you do n't want to be associated with the far right stereotype that often comes with being texan and therefore call yourself american over texan , even though you like being texan . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's a good analogy but it 's the best i could think of . 
  hope it helps . 
  the sooner these fuckers are stomped out the better . 
  i agree completely and i wish that the bbc did show salmond 's reply among the other stuff you posted . 
  how are you supposed to make a well informed decision on your country 's future if the media enacts cloak and dagger movements over everything ? 
  my previous post was purely tongue in cheek . 
  england and wales have the same criminal laws as far as i can tell , which is why you always see england and wales being in the same category when criminal statistics come up , but scotland and northern ireland are grouped independently . 
  i have no idea about taxes unfortunately .

  but how else are they going to stop them from scaremongering ? 
  [ alfred heathlare is on his way in !,

  that 'll be a good flag for when we turn fascist at least, 
  do n't worry , the sharia police are coming to behead me as we speak,
