england is where all the money / work is . 
  particularly in the south east . 
  edit for clarification : many people move from scotland , wales and ni to england to find work . 
  that 's fair . 
  i doubt people would struggle to understand ` have you a pen ' , though . 
  also note , i 'm from the north , where this construction is more common . 
  it is a little old fashioned though , and idiomatically different depending on where you 're from . 
  for instance i 've heard people ( generally older people ) use a structure which is difficult to write but it 's something like `` hast th ' ... ? '', 
  or `` hast th ' not ... ? '', 
  meaning , `` have you ... ? '', 
  or `` have you not ... ? '', 
  which could refer to a simple request for an item , using your example you 'd end up with something like `` hast th ' a pen ? '', 
  as with everything in uk english , though , your mileage may vary , this is probably fine in one area , but nonsensical in another . 
  travelling around this place must be a nightmare for non-native speakers . 
  szurely not . 
  also likely acceptable in the uk , depending on circumstances . 
  fine among friends , not so good as your opening statement to the judge . 
  the `` have you ... '' is a completely valid structure in modern english . 
  as in `` have you got ... '' , '' have you been ... '' and so on . 
  it might not be what you learned in school , but it 's extremely common in the uk . 
  the problem with the original german translation is the lack of a specific subject , which makes it seem vague at least . 
  alas , my german is far from perfect , as a recent trip to d\u00fcsseldorf illustrated . 
  i went over there with an idea that i 'd be able to at least have a basic conversation with someone , only to be quickly reminded after getting lost that the majority of the german language that i know comes from rammstein songs , and is therefore largely useless in day-to-day conversation . 
  google translate really mangled that one . 
  `` predator food recapture intervall violence two thousand '', 
  i think you mean ; katzef\u00fctterungmanagerzweitausend . 
  that did n't kill him . 
  testicular cancer did n't kill him . 
  nobodyi strangled him to death in the european parliament . 
  i 'm beginning to wonder what it will actually take to finish him off , fucking toad that he is . 
  and it would be the very least he deserves . 
  # ** stop fearing others you ridiculous manchild **, 
  its a fair argument . 
  but it ignores the fact that these people are still uk citizens , and they might want to return home at some point . 
  i 've known people move abroad for a few years , for work , or just the experience of living in a foreign country , or whatever . 
  that does n't always mean they intend that to be a permanent arrangement . 
  nothing , and that is exactly how it should be . 
  british expats did n't get a vote , neither did the eu migrants living here . 
  also , in scotland 's independence referendum a couple of years ago , 16 and 17 year-olds were allowed a vote . 
  any one of these things would likely have swung the brexit referendum the other way . 
   the `` final deal '' will need approval by the house of commons and the house of lords which sounds fine , until you realise that the tories will still be in power at that point , and the choice becomes `` take the deal we have now , or we leave with no deal at all , and revert to wto rules . '', 
  yes . 
  there has been some small talk of abandoning it recently . 
  but nothing serious . 
  do n't worry , gaspard , some of us remember that you 've won more wars than you 've lost . 
  not many of us , but some , at least . 
  you do n't have to tell me about the uk 's awful political system , i 've lived here for 30 years . 
  what ? 
  the uk has basically 2 political parties , labour , and the tories who might reasonably form a government in westminster on their own . 
  any of the others ( lib dems , ukip , snp etc. ), 
  are comparatively tiny , and due to the fptp system , that 's how it is likely to remain . 
  everyone knows turkey has the best constitution . 
  tremendous !, 
  lets make the empire ottoman again !!!, 
   tell others what to think perhaps your reading comprehension is not the strongest ? 
  there is really no need to argue semantics . 
  the fact that there may be multiple groups of fascists , does not make geert wilders less of a fascist . 
  if the dutch people have sense , he 'll lose the coming election , and be forgotten about . 
  this kind of populism has been a serious problem this year . 
  brexit , trump , etc. 
  they 're dutch , anti-islam , and they 're a political party . 
  so i 'm pretty sure it does . 
  also , geert wilders looks like a ventriloquist 's dummy . 
  i thought that the vast majority of the population of russia lived in the `` western '' part of the country ? 
  if that is so , given that most of the other countries that made up the ussr are further to the west than the western side of russia , does n't this make logical sense ? 
  forgive me if i 'm not understanding you correctly . 
  neither is judaism . 
  i fail to see your point . 
  so , we 're with western europe ? 
  or do we get our own category ^ ^ since ^ ^ ^ brexit ? 
  honestly it seems pretty accurate to me , although it 's odd to see a brit referring to central europe at all . 
  its not a term you hear very often over here . 
  home : [ stilton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stilton_cheese ) away : [ manchego ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manchego ), 
  capers and mozerella . 
  sounds delicious . 
  did you just get the holes ? 
   it 's very satisfying to see these bitches pay for crimea yeah , they caused all that chaos and death so now we 're hitting them where it really hurts , their lack of quality dairy goods . 
  that 'll teach them . 
  i suspect that depends largely on what qualifies as `` urban '' . 
  which could potentially vary greatly between countries . 
  note i 've never visited russia , so i do n't know this to be the case , just an intuitive answer . 
  someone should warn them that it does n't get any better , really . 
  i imagine he 'll be spending a gouda mount of time in prison for this one . 
  i have no idea whether that 's correct , but i 'd bet that it is n't . 
   ginger nut solid dipping biscuit , that . 
  although in this case i reckon it was a chocolate digestive , probably milk chocolate , but you ca n't have everything i suppose . 
   pushing an agenda well , clearly you 'd know all about that . 
  would it not have been easier to say `` my wife/partner/ex / whatever is finnish . 
  congratulations friend . 
  it seems you have reached peak sausage . 
  the polish one is upside down . 
  damn it france , more like . 
  we had our own language until the ~ ~ normans ~ ~ french invaded in 1066 . 
  would you rather read/write [ like this ] ( http://www.public.asu.edu/~gelderen/hel/chron.html ), 
  holy shit , it 's 297 degrees outside . 
   good old farenheits `` it 's 100 degrees out there ! '', 
  `` no it is n't . '', 
  you should n't . 
  she has to remain politically impartial . 
  to the point that while the monarch is entitled to vote in an election / referendum , there 's a long-standing tradition of them abstaining from doing so .
