  if the queen were to be seen to support one party or another , you can bet there would be a sizeable chunk of the population that would just go along and vote for them on that principle alone . 
  wampires , in lithuania i think . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm sure life under putin will be wonderful . 
  it was a joke . 
  ~ ~ the bildeberg group ~ ~ ~ ~ the cia ~ ~ ~ ~ russians ~ ~ ~ ~ nazis ~ ~ ~ ~ jews ~ ~ ~ ~ freemasons ~ ~ ~ ~ reptillians ~ ~ nope , this time it 's the french . 
  i knew they were n't to be trusted . 
  i sort of agree with you . 
  but i feel like our two ideas are related . 
  a larger majority effectively does increase her power , at least insofar as it makes the chance of a backbench rebellion by the brexit club ( once she inevitable starts to backslide on the ~ ~ strong and stable ~ ~ tough rhetoric during the negotiations ) less likely , and if one did occur , the extra seats in the commons , who will no doubt have been selected to run during her term in office would ( hopefully ) be enough to shut them up . 
  as for idealising of the past , what can you expect ? 
  they 're tories . 
  there is nobody in the cabinet under the age of 40 , and a fair number of them are approaching retirement age . 
   why does theresa may want a hard brexit i do n't actually believe she does . 
  she campaigned to remain in the eu . 
  her government does n't have a large majority , so she cant risk a major rebellion from the elements of her party which do want a so-called ` hard brexit ' . 
  that said , with the larger majority she hopes to gain in next weeks election she would in theory be better able to ignore the lunatic fringe and work towards a more reasonable compromise with the eu . 
  although its anyone 's guess as to whether that would actually work out or not . 
  there 's also the question of simple habit . 
  like in the us and elsewhere , our conservatives have an enormous hard-on for seeming like they 're the responsible adults making the tough decisions . 
  plus appealing to what is essentially populist sentiment should be an easy win for a party in government . 
  although generally populist politicians will be able to at least do a convincing impression of a human being with a real personality . 
  darth mayder is n't quite there yet . 
  he 's literally standing in the firing line trying to prevent a violent confrontation . 
  his beliefs are irrelevant . 
  he 's trying to save lives in the only way he knows . 
  post of the day . 
  notice that its never been lower than `` substantial '' in all the time they 've been publishing the info . 
  makes you wonder if `` substantial '' is mi5 's equivalent of a `` solid 7 out of 10 '' . 
  with a ridiculous name to boot !, 
  assuming you spelled it right . 
  it looks like a typo . 
  the christian science monitor ? 
  to be fair they were in the middle of a revolution at the time . 
  no they do n't . 
  its hyperbole . 
  even if they do , its still a straw man because that 's not even slightly relevant to the op 's comment , and is being falsely ascribed to him . 
  i was n't responding to the article . 
  i was responding to your rather ridiculous post . 
  i 'm not actually familiar with the irish independent , but from the 5-or-so minutes i 've spent on their site it seems like basically any other newspaper . 
  i 'm not seeing any crazy conspiracy theories . 
  maybe you 'd like to point one out ? 
   terroristic this is not a word . 
   tell me how someone who is a part of a terroristic ( sic ) organisation is n't a criminal ? 
  well i do n't know any terrorists , so i 'm not too well informed on the subject . 
  typically members of proscribed organisations will be arrested . 
   as far as i know fucking slaughtering people is illegal . 
  it is . 
  well done you . 
  you get a gold star and an honours degree in criminal law . 
  what a wonderfully simplistic understanding of criminal justice you have . 
  it must be nice to live in a world so unburdened by complexity . 
  that 's a wonderful straw man you built there . 
  i wonder why you felt the need to set him on fire . 
   that is one of the most disgusting things i 've ever read . 
  then you must not be very well-read . 
   you are having the exact opposite reaction that someone who loves their country and the people around them should have . 
  an appeal to emotion , immediately followed by a dictation of what someone should feel . 
  nice . 
   there is only one solution : send them back . 
  the op is talking about people born in the west . 
  it 's mentioned in the first line of his post . 
  ** there is nowhere to send them back to **  if you 're against violence then you must support it , because the only other option is more violence in the future from doing nothing . 
  guess we 'd better roll out the guillotine and start beheading members of the far-right then . 
  i 'm not sure whether you 're trolling , being willfully ignorant or are just dense . 
  labour `` opening us up to mass immigration '' refers to ** european immigration ** . 
  maybe i 'm misinformed about global terrorism , but i do n't believe that much of it is carried by polish builders . 
   richard spencer followers do n't blow people up either . 
  we had an mp murdered in the street by some far-right asshole less than a year ago . 
   i 'm sick of liberals preaching . 
  well i do n't know what to tell you . 
  if you do n't want to be preached at then just stop being a hateful shithead . 
  pretty simple to be honest . 
  even if you were n't suggesting something completely ridiculous , where would you deport these people , who are/were british citizens to ? 
  so , you 'd rather the police went around arresting people before they actually commit a crime , just on the basis that they might ? 
  it 's also from the ~ ~ torygraph ~ ~ telegraph . 
  a notoriously biased , right-wing publication . 
  getting an honest article about labour from them is like getting blood from a stone . 
  you might want to read andrew neather 's ( the subject of the article you posted ) response to the article [ here ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/andrew_neather#neather.27s_response ) . 
   a right wing fascist we 've already got one , has n't helped . 
   maybe ukip can win a seat . 
  ukip are finished , and good riddance . 
  in the aftermath of the brexit referendum they have no reason to exist . 
  so the only thing they can do now is rebrand themselves as irascible hyper-tories . 
  the one mp they did have ( notorious gurning shithead douglas carswell ) recently left the party to stand as an independent mp . 
  he 'd probably have gone back to the tories if they 'd have him , although that seems unlikely . 
  i 'll be amazed if they manage to win a single seat in the upcoming ge . 
   the elephant in the room come on now man . 
  i 'm no fan of boris johnson either , but this kind of personal insult is just not warranted . 
  you seem angry . 
  ah , fair enough , you 're right . 
  all the ones i saw earlier were  $ 700 . 
  guess they just bury the cheap stuff away . 
  i have a nice old wooden set at home i inherited from my grandfather . 
  do n't play nearly as much as i should though . 
  ridiculously expensive , though . 
   india are you being serious ? 
   globalism is the end stage of capitalism . 
  great , bring it on . 
  ca n't end quick enough as far as i 'm concerned .
