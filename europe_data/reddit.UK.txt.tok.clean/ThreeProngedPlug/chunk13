  the uk , with some degree of democratic principle dating back almost 900 years , does not need the guidance of an international organisation to safeguard it from authoritarianism . 
   have n't you noticed how you can always use the word `` concern '' ( or even worse , `` legitimate concern '' ) to obfuscate the actual argument ? 
  that word is utterly meaningless unless you actually specify those concerns , so that everybody can evaluate their legitimacy for themselves . 
  there 's not a politically aware european who does n't know of these concerns related to immigration , so i should n't have to list them for you , but here you go : * availability of housing * availability of school places * availability of doctor 's appointments * clash of cultures * increased terrorism * increased crime * harmful effects of fundamental islam * negative impact on the economy * erosion of national identity  deporting people for hate speech is inherently authoritarian . 
  human rights legislation is n't being `` abused '' to prevent that , it is used exactly as intended . 
  different countries and cultures define human rights differently , and across the entire political spectrum british people and politicians oppose the european convention on human rights . 
  allowing prisoners to vote for example goes against the ` sense of fair play ' that has been ingrained in british culture for hundreds of years . 
  that seems to perfectly describe the british labour party . 
  i wonder why these parties seem so surprised that the working class have turned to the more right-leaning parties in the west when they 've been abandoned by the left for so long now . 
  none of this will end well . 
  if the real democratic deficit and dismantling of national sovereignty could be exposed and be understood by everyday people across the eu , it would come crashing down in an instant . 
  no british paper took up this argument and it was very much down to national identity and immigration . 
  the eu has committed itself to deeper integration . 
  until the lisbon treaty , there was acknowledged democratic deficit , so in order to correct that and establish accountability , more power has been taken away from national chambers and given to a distant , confusing group of european union institutions which no normal individual in europe could tell the difference between . 
  what is the difference between the european council and the council of the european union ? 
  what powers does the european parliament have , and how is this connected to the european commission ? 
  normal people are unable to answer these questions and are personally removed from the process . 
  remaining in the eu , the options are either facing democratic deficit or the erosion of national sovereignty , and neither are acceptable to the people of the uk , and i do n't think it will be acceptable to many other europeans in 20 or 30 years time when the matter needs ultimate resolving . 
  that 's just because of the decline of the pound though , there 's been no loss in economic activity or recession to speak of , merely that gbp translate into fewer dollars at the moment . 
  there 's every reason to believe that in say , 7 years even , that sterling will be back at the level it 's used to . 
  7 years is n't long in the life of a nation . 
  what a disgusting attempt at social engineering , yet another vile jab at the ` silent majority ' who do not step in line to the increasingly * real * authoritarianism of the ` left ' . 
  apparently it uses from data from yougov , is it the same data behind the following article : from the bbc , this april just gone [ around 50 % ` hold authoritarian views ' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36043219 )  mr scotto said : '' ** people like us academics and the london elite ** just ** shrug off concerns about immigration ** , they ** shrug off concerns about the decline of britain as a military power ** . 
   the study - shared with bbc radio 4 's today programme - measured the sentiment by ** assessing respondents ' ideological sympathy for the market and rolling back the state ; a `` strong and tough '' foreign policy ; a negative emotional response to immigration ; a critical attitude to human rights and disapproval of the european union ** . 
  here we have the voice of the self-proclaimed ` elite ' , which apparently you can not be a part of if you oppose their ideological world view of globalisation , and you have no chance if you 're just a northern barbarian . 
  * if you are anti-european union because of the admitted democratic deficit , you hold authoritarian views . 
  * if you are anti-european union because you are anti-globalisation and retain faith in the nation state model , you hold authoritarian views . 
  * if you are concerned with migration levels that are 3x more what they were in the [ 1990s ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/25/race.world ) , you hold authoritarian views . 
  * if you concern yourself with your nation 's geopolitical position in the world , you hold authoritarian views . 
  * if you disapprove of the abuse of human rights legislation by hate preachers which prevents them being deported , you hold authoritarian views . 
  if you disagree with the views of the left you are not an academic but a simple barbarian . 
  this will become a new buzzword , just like ` racist ' , ` fascist ' or ` nazi ' . 
  the true authoritarianism of the left revealed . 
  what ever happened to the left caring about the poor and working classes of their own countries , instead of becoming spokespeople for ` refugees ' , international institutions and ` the environment ' . 
   you seem to be under the strange impression that the uk has more economic or military power than france ? 
  you clearly did n't read my post , did you ? 
  i made no such sweeping claim and in fact i challenge you to find an instance in my post where i made such claims , the presence of which , even if existent , are entirely irrelevant to the message within my actual comment . 
  regardless , the uk does have more ` economic power ' than france and i 'd like you to find reasoning as to why that might not be the case . 
  [ even in the face of brexit , the uk is still forecast to become the largest economy in europe by the 2030s ] ( http://www.ftseglobalmarkets.com/news/cps-study-puts-the-uk-economy-ahead-of-germany-by-2032-with-better-support-for-its-aged-population.html ) . 
  and regardless of that , the uk is home to london which remains the world 's premier financial centre . 
  military power is harder to measure , and contrasting reports will place the uk and france ahead of eachother to suit whatever political purpose the report was commissioned for . 
  and you profess to have studied law ? 
  did you pass , even despite of your clear incapacity to draw the correct conclusions from a short passage of text ? 
  this is for / u/lamps-n-magnets too . 
  scottish nationalist redditors have a habit of accusing anyone who has a divergent opinion or contrasting fact of being a ` troll ' . 
  failing that , your account must actually be an ` alt ' under the control of a mysterious single entity . 
  i 've even seen one redditor propose that it 's ` westminster ' behind this conspiracy . 
  i agree with you . 
  they call the uk a ` country of countries ' , but tell me , which of these has a seat at global institutions such as the un ? 
  the name is only a term used to satiate rabid nationalists . 
  scotland , wales and northern ireland are merely regions of the uk , the british state , which hold a degree of autonomy as in spain for example . 
  a ` country of countries ' would be more applicable to the federal structures of the usa or germany , rather than the uk which retains a unitary structure . 
  there is no ` european sphere of influence ' . 
  scarcely any external countries are influenced by the actions of the eu . 
  even the african nations in direct dependence on eu aid only pay lip-service to the fleeting moral principles that the eu tries to impose on them through weak policies that ca n't even be defined as traditional ` soft power ' . 
  the uk is n't losing real influence by leaving the eu . 
  in fact it will be able to reassert influence as an independent actor on the world stage as it will no longer be bound by the common foreign and security policy , which even calls for actions at the unsc to be ` concerted ' and to preserve the interests of the eu . 
  russia is a pale ghost of its former self . 
  with practically no prospect of the growth required to take it back into the world 's top 10 economies , it only maintains influence in central asia because no one has decided to challenge it yet . 
  with the ascendancy of pakistan in decades to come , with a population forecast to reach 300m by 2050 , i 'm sure that will change . 
  there 's even prospect for iran to challenge russian power in that region . 
  despite french delusions , the eu is not an extension of france and never will be because it 's expanded to cover too many nations and because of french economic stagnation . 
  in any reassessment of the unsc , france would definitely lose its permanent seat in favour for a pan-eu seat . 
  harder to say what the future of the uk 's seat would be , but it certainly would n't automatically lose it , as it would no longer be a member of the eu and its seat could n't be ` absorbed ' . 
  the uk does n't have a direct sphere of influence where it is the prime power , but it still maintains strong relations with nations all around the world , as diverse as chile to malaysia , and the uk is consistently ranked 1st/2nd in terms of ` soft power ' , make of that what you will of course . 
  no one is attempting to reassert an imperialistic british sphere of influence in the world , but to merely adapt and expand the uk 's current portfolio of international relations with rising powers such as mexico , indonesia and nigeria to secure further prosperity in decades to come , which it remains perfectly able to do as the world 's 5th largest economy for example . 
  the fact remains that the uk retains an important place in global affairs , even in the face of supposedly rising superpowers like brazil , and it will remain an important power for the foreseeable future . 
  any form of perceived brit-bashing here will be appreciated however i 'm sure . 
  the uk is n't about to become equal to venezuela or thailand , as of yet there is no nation that can take on the niche role that the uk retains , even outside of the eu . 
  in truth , british membership in the eu has only served as a pathway for american influence into the eu , and it 's right that the uk does what 's good for itself for a change . 
  i contest that the world is shifting from a unilateral to very limited multilateral system where only the prime two or three * most * - powerful nations will still exert spheres of influence . 
  the world is reaching a level of prosperity where even in south america alone there are two to three competing blocs , depending on definitions . 
  geopolitical influence is no longer the remit of superpowers alone , and all nations will either see a shrink in their own external influence or see it stagnate at levels much less potent than previously imagined . 
  how about belgium incinerates london and birmingham , the uk flattens brussels and antwerp and then both our countries will be better off !, 
  there can never be major war between developed countries because of globalisation , indeed that is its only redeeming factor . 
  in the imaginary , impossible , nonsensical scenario that there was war in europe ... between sweden and france for example ( maybe sweden made a tasty new cheese that 's undercutting french produce ) . 
  france could never militarily attack sweden because it would kill not only french citizens in sweden but also potentially kill americans , chinese , argentinian , somalian ( definitely ) and indian civilians too , leading to global crisis , and vice versa that sweden could n't attack france either . 
  we are living in a golden age of peace never experienced before . 
  why is he not allowed to have that viewpoint ? 
  he probably means it in earnest and is n't ` trolling ' . 
  i think many of the eu 's internal problems would n't exist today if eastern european countries had never joined up to it , and if the eu has any interest in surviving it should consider the option of membership reform . 
  yes you should probably go to bed . 
  goodnight fella !, 
  there are vast swaths of self-hating brits in the uk . 
  it 's a long-documented phenomenon . 
  as george orwell once said :  england is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality . 
  in left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an englishman . 
  it is a strange fact , but it is unquestionably true , that almost any intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during ` god save the queen ' than of stealing from a poor box . 
  yes , as i say it 's using a modified american system - of course the components come from america . 
  it 's the cheapest option . 
  there is no imaginable situation where relations between the uk and us will decline , and in any scenario the uk is capable of developing an alternative system , as are countless countries around the world such as japan and germany which choose not to and politically ca n't . 
  the point is that it is ` functionally independent ' , it is able to be launched by the uk without american approval , and that 's what matters here - and ideally it would never be used unilaterally by the uk anyway , but as a final action in a western coalition against some sort of existential threat . 
   and as i said most have said they 're considering moving to the eu . 
  physically absolutely impossible , and even if it was n't it would n't happen . 
  you are blinded by some sort of hatred of the uk , and i think we need to establish why . 
  where are you from ? 
   all of which i think are in at least considering moving to the eu from the uk . 
  nuclear weapons ? 
  they 're rented from the us , big woop . 
  they 're not rented from the americans .
