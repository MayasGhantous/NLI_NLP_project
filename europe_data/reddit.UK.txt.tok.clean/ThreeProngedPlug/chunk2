  views on hungary are harder to ascertain . 
  my stepfather 's mother was in a relationship with a man from hungary for a while , and during this time i remember my incredibly middle class grandparents on my mother 's side reacting very cautiously to the news `` so there 's a hungarian in the family ! '', 
  they would say quite bemused . 
  out of the whole bunch , i think the most negative views are directed towards bulgarians and romanians , for various reasons really . 
  partly because these groups have n't been seen to ` settle ' in the uk with families and because of crime , but also because they are the newest arrivals , and definitely for hard eurosceptics the admittance of them into the uk after 2014 symbolises a victory of the eu over the uk . 
  i do n't know much about it , but from my limited knowledge i think there also seems to be pan-european dislike of romanian ` gypsies ' as well that influences opinion . 
  ** it 's important to remember that only a few british people have really negative views of eastern europeans , while most people are neutral . 
  most animosity comes from the fact that immigration itself is just too high . 
  i think people would direct their frustrations against french people if there were hundreds of thousands coming into the uk each year . 
  ** ** the problem is that small groups of intolerant people can be the loudest , overpowering the voice of the majority who are absolutely happy with people from central and eastern europe , but just want the net migration figure to be reduced to sustainable levels , regardless of where people are coming from . 
  that 's right you make some good points . 
  i think the problem for some people with ' i vow to thee my country ' is that its has roots in war and is used at remembrance events and the like . 
  it seems that even with the middle verse not sang the song can bother certain fragile people . 
  they 're very nice , i 'm certain i 've heard the tune of ` bayernhymne ' before somewhere , it 's quite familiar . 
  ode to joy is great of course , i 've always really liked the anthem of [ east germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1cypjqqtam ) personally . 
  well that 's very good symbolism i suppose but it a bit limited in historical and cultural meaning . 
  ' i vow to thee my country ' is one of my absolute favorites , definitely my choice of replacement anthem if we get to that stage . 
  i think sadly enough there are people in the world who will find offense at anything . 
   which is why you ought to have nice bridges and gates  hmm sorry i do n't understand , what do you mean by that exactly ? 
  is n't [ tower bridge ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/tower_bridge_london_feb_2006.jpg ) quite nice ? 
  well i never said god save the queen should be played , i said the ` national anthem ' should , whatever that could be . 
  in any case , i think that [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onwgeqesike ) version of god save the queen is pretty powerful , even if it is n't as good as some alternatives . 
   one can be jingoistic about invading other countries while being a little englander in one 's attitude to immigrants . 
  so you 're saying that being opposed to a high level of immigration or wanting to filter immigration to only skilled people is the same as invading another country ? 
  this effort at redefining language really is a terrible attempt at social engineering , designed to close down and limit discussion of topics like migration which people should be free to question . 
  when attitudes like yours are picked up and proliferated by the media and politicians , it 's no wonder that we get brexit and donald trump . 
  oh as if it would play when cbbc closes down . 
  playing the national anthem is no more nationalistic than having the queen on banknotes and coins . 
  are children being indoctrinated by nationalism when they get pocket money as well ? 
  bbc1 does ` closedown ' still . 
  it is a mirror of bbc news past 1.30 am , so effectively it closes down at 1.30 am, 
  and you , a scottish * nationalist * ( what does that tell you ? ), 
  are relishing the opportunity to decry anyone who voted for brexit as someone who supports the rounding up and shooting of anyone who voted remain . 
  this is one article in one newspaper written by one person . 
  i 'm not sure why people view the idea of playing the national anthem at ` closedown ' as jingoistic . 
  it 's something the bbc should do regardless of whether the uk is part of the eu or not as an established tradition . 
  it 's hardly offensive , and i do n't see how it 's any different from keeping red buses , pillar boxes and phone-booths in london . 
  here is a nice friendly and calm bbc closedown from [ 1997 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nokcoiozbpk ), 
  except the conservatives have been in power time and time again and yet to the general bemusement of the political illiterate the nhs still exists . 
  vote leave is n't the government . 
  they never had any say over how the money would be spent so they could n't make any legitimate claims regarding how any money could be spent . 
  nothing either campaign made can be held up to scrutiny in this sense . 
   nice try pinning that one on the eu , mate . 
  `` can you tell me to what degree , ** if at all ** , these organisations affect life in the uk and other member-states ? '', 
  it 's a purposeful inclusion to indicate how confusing the various systems of the eu and europe in general are . 
  you might call it a trick question . 
   also this is the first time i 've seen the european council and the council of the european union referred to as organisations . 
  well that 's exactly what they are . 
  they 're officially called ` institutions ' which the word organisation is a perfect synonym for . 
  you need to stop with this offensive narrative that people who voted for brexit thinks like this , because it only makes you look like an idiot . 
   lazy immigrants taking our jobs and claiming unemployment benefits yes , there are migrants into the uk , some of whom take jobs in the retail sector and prevent lower skilled people from getting those jobs for example , and some migrants who receive benefits instead of working . 
  migrants alone receive # 5 billion in child tax credits . 
   the eu being a bureaucratic nightmare filled with red-tape yet controlling our laws and sovereignty can you tell me the difference between the * council of europe * , the * european council * and the * council of the european union * ? 
  can you tell me to what degree , if at all , these organisations affect life in the uk and other member-states ? 
  i ** guarantee ** you are just as ignorant of how the eu works as anyone else , regardless of how they voted . 
   the nhs which is a bloated burden on our taxes no one in the uk wants to destroy the nhs , some people just want it to work better and be more value for money . 
   should also be given another # 350m a week that was only stated as an * example * of what the money could be spent on . 
  there are no ` insults ' in my posts , the same ca n't be said for yours . 
  it boggles the mind that you can make bizarre claims ( that the uk economy is ` fucked ' ) and just expect no one to challenge your spread of misinformation . 
  no one forced you to reveal personal information about yourself . 
  just because you have poor judgement and have continually made mistakes does n't mean i have to lower myself as well . 
   and it definitely is n't good in my field at all in programming and technology stuff . 
  this is a bad life choice in general . 
  it is widely acknowledged that within 10 years almost all programming and coding will be outsourced to indians who will do it on the cheap . 
  it 'll be the telecoms industry v2 . 
   a fucked economy is just the icing on a shitty cake . 
  the british economy has been the fastest growing major developed economy for the last 7 years . 
  everywhere all you spout is unguided anti-uk nonsense . 
  never mind . 
   so you are saying us helps finland militarily when finland is n't even in nato , and the us has n't actually done anything to help finland , but it counts because they 've started helping from the very moment finland has not been involved in any wars . 
  the usa 's unilateral , ** blanket ** protection of all of non-soviet europe had been politically ensured for decades . 
  finland would ** never ** been invaded like the ukraine has been today in the 20th century because of american commitment to self-determination via the truman doctrine . 
  regardless , the usa and finland are [ increasing security ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/finland-us-russia-military-security ) ties this year because of russian aggression , likely allowing finland to keep its defence budget low . 
   i think your chat about lack of importance of nordic countries just proves my point more . 
  that was just a part of the point but you are definitely trying to perpetuate the stereotype about how brits view the world instead of these meaningless claims you could elaborate more and justify your opinion . 
  the scandinavian countries are somewhat important , i never said that they were not . 
  but what global influence do they have ? 
  how does their ` soft power ' have a greater reach than the soft power of the uk , or even australia for example ? 
  the greatest influence scandinavia has is through norway 's ` nobel prize ' award system which becomes more farcical each year in my opinion . 
  the nordic council has a population of just 25 million people , and its total gdp would be around us$ 1.60 trillion and it would be the world 's 12th largest economy . 
  this is good and ahead of other countries like spain and the netherlands but it is smaller than canada 's or italy 's economy , and therefore it ca n't be considered as important as those countries , or countries like the uk and france which remain ` great powers ' with nuclear weapons and permanent seats at the united nations security council , able to veto resolutions set out by this body , which is the most powerful forum of the un . 
  i 'd be willing to continue discussing this with you but you need to be more open to debate . 
  it 's completely debatable as to whether usa ` investment ' in europe has paid off yet . 
   is it really that hard to imagine that a europe run by nazis or communists is n't really in the interest of the us ? 
  not of vital , existential importance . 
  the usa could have easily demanded maximum military contributions from western european countries to pan-european defence forces and focused on east asia more . 
  europe would be as equally protected as it was from communism today , except by necessity w. european countries would have had to spend more of their budgets on self-defence , reducing their social budgets as a consequence . 
   your type of chat is exactly what i 'm talking about so thanks for adding this to my point . 
  `` so unimportant , how could they possibly be better than us at anything '' i did n't deny that the nordic countries were not ` better ' in some aspects . 
  every country is better and worse than others . 
  it is * factual * that scandinavia , as a region , is collectively less important than france is by itself . 
  this is because of the population , economy and military strength of france , and the same goes for lots of other countries that are singly more ` important ' than scandinavia . 
  rather than read what i 've had to say you 've just responded with an automatic angry response and decided yourself what i actually said . 
   right , i dont recall anyone helping out finland during russian invasion so would be great if you could provide an example of this . 
  that was before the end of the second world war . 
  the usa has been the main power that has defended europe from the russians since 1945 . 
   its practically offensive to the nordics , because it usually is followed by `` wtf , instead the country leading in equality/healthcare/social welfare/education/etc is so and so little nordic country nobody ever hears about , no way '' you ca n't really be offended because a lot of other people have the view that the nordic countries are unimportant . 
  one of the reasons that they are ` unimportant ' is because they spend their money on healthcare and social programmes instead of their militaries while largely relying on the blanket protection of the usa and others , even while not officially being part of nato . 
  i 'm sure america would be unimaginably wealthier today and europe would be considerably poorer had the usa not spent the last 70 years funding and facilitating european reconstruction . 
  if i were an american i 'd probably be irritated by that .
