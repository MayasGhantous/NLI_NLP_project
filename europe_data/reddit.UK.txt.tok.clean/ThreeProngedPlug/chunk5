  the left-wing anglophobes in the uk are shuddering and shaking with rage and hatred and you can feel it in their articles . 
  as george orwell once said :  england is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality . 
  in left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an englishman . 
  it is a strange fact , but it is unquestionably true , that almost any intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during ` god save the queen ' than of stealing from a poor box . 
  well it 's still a fun website to check out anyway, 
  not quite . 
  you can play around and see the true size of countries with this website though . 
  well it 's a bit more significant than that . 
  every week we are told that we 're approaching economic turmoil but once again the uk has had strong economic growth . 
  german economic growth figures for q4 2016 wo n't be released until the 14th of february , but it 's expected to be at 0.4 % . 
  in q3 2016 it was just 0.2 % . 
  in both quarters the uk had 0.6 % growth , so it shows that the uk has a very strong economy despite all the turmoil thus far resulting from the brexit vote . 
  originally it was forecast the uk would enter recession after the vote . 
  plenty of articles are posted here in an attempt to paint the uk in a bad light . 
  there have been indexes on here titled `` uk has lowest public confidence in this '' or `` uk least trustworthy of government '' etc , but in reality the uk is only near the bottom and other european countries are at the bottom instead . 
  i think it 's good to share some good news about the uk for once . 
  almost no one made their choice on the eu based on that claim about nhs funding . 
  it only became noteworthy * after * the referendum as it was subsequently held up as a ` broken promise ' made by brexiteers , even though all along the people making such proposals never had authority to implement any funding changes . 
  the eu has never been popular in the uk , and it reached an all time low after the euro crisis , migrant crisis and increase in terrorist attacks . 
  13 august 2016 : [ brexit : government guarantee for post-eu funds ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37060430 ), 
  everyone get 's older . 
  at least [ her words will stand the test of time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tetk_ayo1x4 ) . 
  same ca n't be said about the eu these days . 
  it 's the * national * health service , not the international health service . 
  i think that prosperity is n't only measured though economics , in fact i do n't think it can be measured quantitatively at all . 
  there are all sorts of factors like cultural cohesion for example . 
  i think to be prosperous you need to be happy , and a great deal of people in the uk have become rather unhappy with issues relating to the single market and european union at large . 
  most importantly though , i think you need to have democratic accountability , and there had been a sense that has been lost over recent years . 
  it 's noticeable that rarely anyone in the remain camp said `` let 's stay in the eu/sm because it 's great '' , but rather just because it would be bad if we left . 
  / u/wurfw  so no brexit after all ? 
  / u/r4ndom _ hero  is that why you 're leaving eu ? 
  the uk government campaigned against brexit . 
  but even if we say that brexit will impact the economic prosperity of the uk , it has to be remembered that there are other forms of prosperity . 
  no one wants to live in a gilded cage . 
  there 's no point in being wealthy if you lack political power . 
  a country needs political and mental well-being as well in equal measure . 
  now i 'm not saying at all that the eu is anything like china , but when you see how [ in this video for example how * disgustingly * undemocratic china is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1hdciw2xtk ) it really makes you value your own democracy . 
  i think that in the uk people are just used to being able to hold politicians to account directly for their bad governance , which is a lot harder to do with eu officials . 
   i can honestly say that lifelong travel has completely erased all feelings of national identity . 
  we 're just humans . 
  well i 'm afraid i do n't believe you ( regarding national identity - we are all humans of course ) . 
  in any case , such rejection of national identity is not the enlightened product of self-evaluation and comparison achieved via travel . 
  travel only makes it clear how distinct cultures actually are , especially if one does travel outside of europe . 
  i really do n't meant to come as condescending as this will seem but i ca n't word it differently - i believe you 've either tricked yourself into thinking this is the case or that you reject your nationality as part of a larger twisted ideology . 
  i do n't know what your home country is , but it 's becoming increasingly clear that in some european countries in particular there 's no room left for one 's ethno-cultural identity . 
  all you have to do is compare how the leaders of the [ uk ] ( http://snappa.static.pressassociation.io/assets/2015/10/06122022/1444130420-2f415ef1cf437e3ad7533286fd13d94c-600x392.jpg ) and [ germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rcc7xgd2dm ) behave around flags . 
  modern day nationality is the expression of the same societal attachment that allowed man to develop meaningful civilisation . 
  it 's an entirely normal expression of human nature . 
  i think that the government of a country should serve its people , so that 's where we 'll have an irreconcilable disagreement over the matter . 
  i 'll clarify for you . 
  - i do n't think the uk today as a non-imperial non-interventionist power ( if the uk is n't one of these currently then it should strive to be one ) should attempt to interfere with the legislation of another country . 
  - i do n't think the human rights laws of another country have anything to do with the uk . 
  - i do n't think the uk should * unilaterally * restrict itself from trading with countries that do not respect human rights laws . 
  - clearly luxembourg does n't have an issue with human rights transgressions either , as there 's a whole institution that 's been around since the 1970s designed to foster trade between the shitting-on-human-rights arab world and belgium and luxembourg , the [ ablcc . 
  ] ( http://www.ablcc.org/about-us/about-us ) nor does luxembourg decline the offshore stashing of blood-stained royal saudi money . 
  - i do n't think the uk has a responsibility to maintain human rights laws in other countries any more than any other country in the world , which is why i think it ludicrous for the uk to be the country to unilaterally self harm itself while every other country in the world tries to increase trade with the region . 
  - i want the uk government which is meant to serve me , to look out for * me * most , as a citizen of the uk . 
  - i want the british government to hold * me * in higher esteem than hundreds of millions of non-british citizens around the world who have other governments which are meant to be looking out for them but for whatever reason no fault of my own or the british government are not . 
  - i want the british government to put * me * ahead of a non-british citizen saudi , and i 'm not ashamed to say so , because it 's their * duty * to do so . 
  parts of my post are sarcastic , not all of it is meant to be taken seriously . 
  the message behind it is valid i think however , and if it is n't and is just ` populist bullcrap ' then you 'll be able to counteract it easily with truth , logic and reasoning ? 
  ah well i do n't mean to come across as rude or angry at him , to other british people who complain so much i do mean to come across as a bit condescending however . 
  so i 'm sorry if you felt a bit attacked at all/u/balorat hopefully not though !, 
  it 's almost as though despite constant whinging by semi-politically conscious teenagers online , that in reality the uk * is n't * becoming a far-right authoritarian surveillance state ? 
  for those interested , the uk is one of the least corrupt nations by many measurements . 
  for example , [ the uk ranks 1st in terms of access to official government data , attaining a full 100 points , while the next european country and at 3rd place is sweden with 83.7 points , while denmark is in 9th place with 70.13 points . 
  ] ( http://opendatabarometer.org/2ndedition/analysis/rankings.html ), 
  every country that has any dealing with those in the middle east is putting money above human rights . 
  shock horror , maybe the human rights of other countries are n't the responsibility of the uk ? 
  is n't the uk just an insignificant island nation off the coast of europe after all ? 
  what exactly is the purpose of the un ? 
  this article does n't even refer to arms deals , just the fact that the uk is on the hunt for trade deals in that region . 
  unless every country in the world stops trading with these nations i do n't see why the uk should not attempt to increase trade via a trade deal . 
  the uk government 's prime responsibility is to maintain the prosperity of the citizens of the uk after all , and if these trade deals will do that then so be it . 
  it 's up to the people of saudi arabia to rise up and overthrow the regime if they do n't like it , and who knows - maybe they do ? 
  they seem to love the brutal oppression that is islam after all . 
  would n't want to * impose * or * colonise * their society with dangerous western concepts such as dignity , freedom and equality . 
  curse the uk government for looking after its own citizens !, 
  an eternal hell awaits you , perfidious albion when you finally meet your maker under the mighty boot of president schulz of the greater european co-prosperity sphere ... and so on and so forth !, 
  i did n't know they had such data - would have saved me a good deal of effort working with such abstract data !, 
  it really makes you realise how unbalanced the uk economy is in any case , and it probably has the potential to get worse before it gets better . 
  i can only hope that brexit acts as a starting point for radical reform so that things are better in decades to come . 
  the snp have n't requested another referendum because they know they wo n't win one . 
  the people of scotland are being increasingly let down by the snp who continually focus on the fantasy of independence instead of education and inequality . 
  how about addressing the fact that [ scotland 's economy only grew by 0.2 % in the last released quarter ( q3 , 2016 ) compared with 0.7 % in q3 , 2015 . 
  ] ( http://www.gov.scot/topics/statistics/browse/economy/pubgdp/gdp2016q3 ) scotland 's economy grew at an annualised rate of 0.7 % this year [ while the uk 's economy grew by 0.6 % in q3 , 2016 at an annualised rate of 2.2 % ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp ) , well over double the pace of scotland 's . 
  scotland ca n't afford the uncertainty of another independence referendum , especially when core issues like currency and eu membership have n't been guaranteed . 
  no one knows the true position of the spanish government in 2017 of all years when catalonia is due to hold its own unofficial independence referendum . 
  yep you 're right about italy having a population of 60m of course . 
  i know that to be the case and made a mistake when i typed it . 
  it may sound bizarre but i type ' 65 ' quite frequently , so that 's where my error stems from . 
  i 'll apologise for that and change it . 
  i 'll try and work this out with official data , but it can be hard to come by . 
  because england does n't have its own parliament , it 's very hard to find any official data for the gdp of england . 
  you have to work it out manually instead . 
  according to this government [ source ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/quarterlynationalaccounts/quarter1jantomar2016 ) , the gdp of the uk in 2016 was # 1833 billion , which is just under ** $ 2,300 billion ** when converted using * today 's * exchange rates . 
  according to this scottish government [ source ] ( http://www.gov.scot/topics/statistics/browse/economy/qna2015q4 ) the scottish gdp in 2015 including geographical oil extraction is # 152 billion or ** $ 190 billion ** . 
  according to this welsh government [ source ] ( http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/wgc/files/2016/04/government-expenditure-and-revenue-wales-2016.pdf ) the estimated welsh gdp in 2015 was # 62.5 billion , or ** $ 81.5 billion ** . 
  now bizarrely , according to the northern irish government , the instruments are n't in place to ascertain the gdp of northern ireland . 
  all i can find is the [ experimental estimation of northern irish gdp in 2012 ] ( https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/deti/structure-of-the-ni-economy-2012.pdf ) , which is # 37.2 billion , or ** $ 46.5 billion ** at today 's rates .
