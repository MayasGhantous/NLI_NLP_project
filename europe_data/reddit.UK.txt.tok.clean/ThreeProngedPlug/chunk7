  [ we 've already seen the stirring of economic sectors across europe rallying for a good deal with the uk ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-germany-agriculture-idukkbn15329u ) to maintain their positions . 
  european countries need military cooperation with the uk . 
  at the moment the uk is committed to the defence of eastern and northern europe , and indeed in the face of an isolationist donald trump and a half-interested france , which only rejoined nato in 2009 , the uk becomes even more of the linchpin of nato . 
  this is n't guaranteed however . 
  no one foresaw the british voters opting to leave the eu , and public opinion could shift in britain enough to make nato unpopular . 
  if nato collapses for any reason , an eu defensive force will be just france by itself without the usa and uk . 
  that will likely further russian interests in the region . 
  i think the idea is that us companies would move their european bases to london if it became a tax haven . 
  of course , but i never claimed that they were british missiles either . 
  they 're maintained and such in america yes , but all claims of american * control * over the missiles when in the uk and being able to somehow prevent the launch of them is pure speculation , which sometimes verges on conspiracy theory . 
  the argument goes that if the uk ca n't launch them itself then we might as well get rid of them - but there 's no such evidence that that 's the case . 
  because of strong uk-us nuclear cooperation , the uk maintains its status as a nuclear power at lower cost than france does for example . 
   british missile test malfunctioned last year off u.s. coast quite a tame headline considering it was a trident missile , which are the ones used in the british submarine nuclear delivery system . 
  no technology is perfect of course , and i do n't think this will have any major implications politically . 
  there have been quiet calls for nuclear disarmament recently , but really the election of donald trump just strengthens the main british argument for having nuclear weapons in the first place ( because of his isolationist tendencies ) , which is that the uk needs the ability to prevent itself from being attacked by its own merit if for any reason american support is n't secured . 
   especially if it limits the power of westminster . 
  westminster was the architect of devolution , including proposed devolution in northern england which was ultimately rejected by the people living there . 
  we may all put the kettle on at the same time of day but british people do n't have a hive mind . 
  different british people can have different views . 
  regardless , you can have a weak dictatorship . 
  argentina used to be one . 
  sorry i 'll clarify a bit the geopolitical faults of the eu is * one * of the reasons i do n't like it . 
  i 'd be happy for the eu to be stronger , but if that required federalisation as you say then i would n't want the uk part of it . 
  i 'd be okay with a strong eu without the uk in it because it would hopefully sort the mess in north africa . 
  the unity of the eu still matters british person because it and the countries that comprise are our closest neighbours . 
  the eu will remain relevant from matters ranging from tourism to geopolitics . 
  i have an interest in the latter . 
  that 's why i voted to leave the eu , because i can see that it will either remain semi-unified as a weak actor on the world stage , or dissolve years down the line from now when ultimately the people of europe reject the abolition of their countries in return for a federal europe . 
  in fact even if europeans somehow accepted a federal europe i would still not want the uk part of it , no matter how powerful it was . 
  i do n't like the eu . 
  one of those reasons is because it is a flimsy , weak pathetic force on the world stage and acts in a way i can only describe as ` far-left ' . 
  by this , i mean that is is as though the eu 's foreign policy has been written by the green party here in the uk . 
  if the eu wants to be a voice on the world stage in equal merit to the usa and china , it needs to abandon ridiculous policies such as ` conditionality ' and start ramping up military spending . 
  you can see why the eu is such a failure from sections i 've grabbed from this document [ ` eu conditionality after the arab spring ' ] ( http://www.epc.eu/documents/uploads/pub_2728_papersbalfour_for_euromesco16.pdf ) -------  the arab spring has provided a unique opportunity to revise the european union 's languishing relations with north africa and the middle east . 
  much emphasis has been placed , in speeches and in re-inventing the european diplomatic narrative towards the region , on the eu 's new `` ** listening mode '' ** , and on its `` ** humility ** '' and `` ** modesty ** '' in its dealings with reforming arab leaders . 
   conditionality refers to a complex set of issues including the ability to attach strings to demands , the linkages between political demands and economic incentives , the attraction and credibility of these incentives for them to be effective  conditionality also calls for questioning broader assumptions regarding the leverage of the eu in any given country , its legitimacy in using conditionality in the first place , and the nature of relations between the eu and the north african and middle eastern countries . 
  responding to the emancipation of these countries requires more than listening before offering the usual recipes . 
  rethinking interdependence between the two shores and identifying some common interests could open up a new path towards a more equal relationship . 
   one important shift is towards a more vigorous support of civil society through the civil society facility ( csf ) , a new support for the development and strengthening of political actors . 
   for 2011 to 2013 , the cfs has a budget of $ 22 million for the enp countries , of which $ 11 million is for the southern neighbours . 
   the use of conditionality is indeed a means , but with aims which are exquisitely political . 
  for this reason , its use faces a set of dilemmas that can not be solved by introducing new benchmarks . 
   the first of these dilemmas revolves around whether to engage with countries whose political standards are far from those desired by the eu ( or agreed upon in the various documents and declarations that the eu agrees with third countries ) or whether to condemn these governments  ** while some countries ( but not all ) were occasionally criticised through diplomatic and common foreign and security policy ( cfsp ) tools , negative measures were never contemplated ** . 
  ----------------- eu foreign policy essentially amounts to gently whispering `` please respect human rights and we 'll give you a little bit of money , but if not we 'll just give you money anyway '' to the dictators of north africa in its own back garden . 
  by critising these modernist stations i am by no means lauding any british stations . 
  it 's important to remember that the london underground is 19x longer than helsinki metro , with most sections a lot older . 
  if you want to compare anything ( though not sure why you would because i never called for it ) then you would to compare the new elizabeth line which will be complete in 2019 , and is almost 6 times longer than the helsinki metro . 
  i would n't bother though , because it 's still [ ugly ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/ce50/production/_89661825_db97a72d-5732-4e44-a7d0-7146a0ae63e7.jpg ) , like nearly all new modern european architecture . 
  what has scottish independence got to do with eu nationals in the uk committing crimes and then being held in detention centres ? 
  it 's the eu migrants ' fault that they are being detained , as you can see here :  `` ** if somebody has committed a crime , they should be dealt with by the criminal justice system in the country that they allegedly committed the crime in , '' mr monaghan said ** . 
  `` it 's completely inappropriate for the immigration process to be used as some kind of disposal ** for the criminal justice sector . 
  * ''  ** a home office spokesperson said new regulations had recently been introduced `` enabling us to deport eu nationals who repeatedly commit so-called minor offences -- crimes which nonetheless cause deep pain to the victims and affect communities '' ** . 
  they are being detained because they are committing crimes in the uk are are n't able to be sent back to where they came . 
  the uk has recently passed legislation to facilitate their removal however , and rightfully so , the uk should n't have to deal with foreign prisoners from * anywhere * . 
  perhaps you should keep in mind that almost 40 % of scottish votes in the eu referendum were cast in favour of leaving the eu as well ? 
  furthermore , people who voted for independence previously are somewhat split between those who want to leave and stay in the eu . 
  i mean , why would a country want to leave a union which is becoming more democratic and giving more powers to national parliaments ( the uk ) to join one that is reducing democratic accountability and continually crippling the powers of national parliaments ( the eu ) . 
  i personally think that they 're quite disgusting . 
  [ certainly a decline in architectural standards . 
  ] ( http://www.thehansontwosome.com/stockholm08/img_1752.jpg ) i 'm sure with modern construction and 3d printing such classical styles are a lot cheaper to build in . 
  i do n't know why european countries ( including the uk ) are so keen to destroy their culture and heritage . 
  it 's not like tourists want to see this modernist crap when they go to finland . 
  it does n't belong in even the most artificial of european countries . 
  [ look at how they 've ruined edinburgh . 
  ] ( http://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/files/images/scottish_parliament_from_salisbury_crags.jpg ) compare the beauty of the background to the monstrosity of a ` parliament building ' in the foreground . 
  surprised you can talk about tasting anything with all that saltiness . 
  you 're being pretty silly to imagine that there will be a trade war or embargo . 
  the economies of the eu are too fragile for such actions , and the divergent economies and requirements of say , the netherlands and bulgaria , which trade with the uk to different extents , would create a existential crisis for the nations of the eu , possibly leading to it dissolving . 
  even if such actions by the uk against the eu merited that sort of action , the eu would never behave in such a way because of its ideology . 
  the eu uses ` positive engagement ' , conditional ` mixed-agreements ' and ` socialisation ' to try and encourage the development of normative values in its ` sphere of influence ' and partnership countries . 
  it does n't do hard actions like military action or embargoes , and even sanctions are something of last resort for the eu . 
  regardless of whether there * will * be a ` huge price ' economically or geopolitically ( it 's by no means confirmed you see ) - immigration has become a big enough problem in the entire west for it to become the number one issue for many people , even dwarfing concerns over the economy in some countries like the uk . 
  immigration was not an issue in 1990s britain . 
  that 's because it was 3x lower than what it is today , [ at ` just ' 107k on average net migration ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/25/race.world ) . 
  that 's still a considerable number , especially as in the [ 1970s net migration was at -24,000 . 
  ] ( http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/amm_2004/hatton_t129.pdf ) very few people in the uk thought that there would be an economic * benefit * from leaving the eu , but rampant immigration at near-record highs of [ net 333k a year ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382199 ) has created a fundamental shift in uk society , and for many people economic or political consequences have become well worth the ability to lower migration levels which have placed incredible strain on housing , infrastructure and medical services . 
  * some * of these issues may be because of lack of action and investment by the british government , but not all of it . 
  no country should have to deal with such rapid population growth . 
  canada , despite having a smaller population , has a similar level of net migration - but it is across a vast country at rates comparatively sound for each province , while in the uk it is concentrated in the densely populated plains of south east england . 
  surely no government can adequately act to mitigate such growth . 
  this storm has been brewing for over a decade , and our leaders only have themselves to blame . 
  no party campaigned in the uk on lowering immigration for 15 years . 
  now , when faced with such problems , it is any surprise that people resort to such drastic action to reclaim even a shred of control back over their own societies which are being teared apart ? 
  some uk commentators seem to be concerned by the loss of national income that would ensue from lowering these taxes , but it could perhaps end up bringing in more money in the long term , with short term losses covered by an increase in borrowing perhaps or reduction of the # 12.5 billion foreign aid budget . 
  according to the article each one percentage point reduction in corporation taxes reduces income for the government by # 2 billion , so a good chunk the foreign aid budget , which many people in the uk already loath for being too high , can temporarily be cut to maintain social spending if necessary i 'd imagine . 
  i think the uk is in a strong position to be honest . 
  i sure hope he does n't die ( painlessly ) !, 
  [ and you can let us know when you 're capable of defending yourselves . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-britain-defence-iduskbn13520q ), 
  if you 're going to attempt to quote me , at least do it properly . 
   i do n't think norway should be lauded ** as some sort of ` green ' country or crusader for the environment in any way . 
  ** norway does have a number of other faults , but this thread is n't about them , nor has my post identified any , therefore it is n't suitable to discuss them . 
  if you want to talk about official , domestically produced carbon emissions , norway still has higher emissions per capita so do n't bother . 
  one of the major reasons to prevent deforestation is because forests act as ` carbon sinks ' absorbing carbon dioxide and therefore reducing the rate of climate change . 
  the production and use of oil releases carbon dioxide into the air , speeding up climate change . 
  therefore , even if norway pays to protect a small amount of forests and peat fields , it is still greatly contributing to climate change by producing and selling oil to foreign countries , and because of this , i do n't think norway should be lauded as some sort of ` green ' country or crusader for the environment in any way . 
  he 's not the chief negotiator , he is the chief * observer * . 
  michel barnier is the chief negotiator . 
  if norway cared about any aspect of the environment it would halt oil extraction now and stop selling it to other countries . 
  norway facilitates large-scale environmental deconstruction every year , as do all countries that sell oil on the world market - it does n't matter how much energy they produce domestically .
