  short of human civilisation collapsing though we should be able to monitor nuclear waste for the next few thousand years . 
  and literally 100,000 die every year thanks to pollution from coal power plants , nuclear power has the lowest fatalities per kwh than any other form of power generation . 
  no they focus infrared radiation onto giant towers of oil or metal salts or onto pipes filled with oil , salts or steam . 
  pv solar plants and thermal energy solar plants are totally different technologies . 
  i 'm not reading that massive wall of unpunctuated , poorly formatted text . 
  if you 're going to make an argument at least capitalize the first letter ... 
  geologically stable ... 
  yes and pv is n't used much in large scale generation . 
  thermal energy from the sun is , using mirrors , it 's a much more efficient much more promising technology that is easier to maintain and control . 
  hence why you also find somewhere geologically stable with a layer of impermeable rock . 
  considering large scale solar generation does n't use pv the point is moot anyway . 
  wind turbines require a large amount of rare earths and are a far better candidate for large scale renewable generation . 
  that 's not how storage works . 
  notice i said geologically stable , as in the ground wo n't move . 
  you find an area where the ground wo n't shift , create a big concrete lined bunker then put your waste in their that ca n't escape from its containers anyway . 
  we already have technologies that we 've used in landfills for decades to stop leachate escaping into ground water , it 's not an engineering challenge . 
  apart from the tellurium needed in pv panels and the two tonnes of neodymium needed for a wind turbine . 
  also indium , silver , gallium etc. 
  so tell me the problems with storing nuclear waste seen as you seem to know so much about it . 
  tell me the engineering problems with storing nuclear waste then ? 
  because of political reasons . 
  it 's really not a challenge from an engineering perspective . 
  find a geologically stable mountain and bury the waste in concrete . 
  it 's that simple . 
  the problem is nobody wants this waste in their backyard . 
  ironically they experimented on the reactor to try and solve a safety issue in case the reactor was shut down in an emergency . 
  you mean radioactive waste that is incredibly easy to contain and store ? 
  it 's far better than carbon emissions which are almost impossible to economically capture and store , not to mention other gaseous emissions that are n't captured . 
  solar uses a huge amount of rare metals and hydrocarbons to produce the mirrors required , and pv panels are even worse . 
  all that for a fairly inefficient , short lifetime generation method . 
  wind is similarly resource costly for little generation potential . 
  nuclear power is the cleanest and [ safest ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/ ) form of power generation , possibly only wind is cleaner but that is never going to become a major power source as it 's so unreliable and causes huge spikes in the grid . 
  nuclear waste is n't a huge problem as its not in a gaseous form so is easy to store . 
  it 's not a problem from an engineering perspective but from a political one . 
  it is more expensive thanks to large capital costs but it 's also the only realistic way we are not going to raise global temperatures massively in the next 100 years . 
  there is a huge amount of fear mongering over nuclear power even though it is statistically the safest and cleanest of all power generation methods . 
  also the fact they deliberately bypassed the safety measures to run an experiment . 
  the swedes do n't like prostitution but do n't punish those who find themselves forced into it , they punish people who would exploit prostitutes instead . 
  punishing the victim is just wrong . 
  not the poor oppressed men who ca n't even pay to spend a night with a hooker without being arrested anymore . 
  what is the world coming to ? 
  selling your own body and working in a pizza shop are two totally different things . 
  clearly the laws are there just to send more men to prison !, 
  you 're just a feminist shill , caring about women and all . 
  i 'm sure the law is there just to imprison men , there 's literally no other reason whatsoever . 
  oh so you 're comparing russia annexing part of a country and supplying arms to separatists to politicians addressing a crowd . 
  yes they 're totally the same thing . 
  the eu and the us did n't get involved in euromaidan ... 
  the actual facts show russia annexed a part of another country , it 's not at all surprising that they are also helping rebels in the east . 
  you are a horrible human being . 
  you sure spend a lot of time trying to argue for the russians on this website . 
  the whole thread is an / r/badhistory gold mine . 
  to be fair the us has n't annexed part of cuba to keep guantanamo yet . 
  do you know why we do n't celebrate the wehrmacht ? 
  because they were responsible for [ things ] ( http://www.pigtailsinpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/babi-yar-massacre-11.jpg ) [ like ] ( http://0.static.wix.com/media/33d6a4_2b9e44c7b4c4ddb45513dbe8515bddef.jpg_512 ) [ this ] ( http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcs033rd1onwggwvqy48zyvora_cohg1qb4wngwcboqahj0bi3d4 ) and [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/ebensee_concentration_camp_prisoners_1945.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kja69lf6lkm/ucwjfu-wvmi/aaaaaaaabes/giqsloctf5y/s1600/files.php.jpg ) . 
  there is no such thing as a clean wehrmacht , it does n't matter if many of the soldiers were conscripted and did n't want to fight , many did want to fight and many joined up under their own free will . 
  this is why we do n't remember german soldiers , because they are responsible for the deaths of more than 30 million people , because they fought for a government whose goal was to kill even more , to wipe out any non-german civilian east of moscow . 
  the allies did n't murder 6 million jews and 6 million other `` undesirables '' , the allies were not responsible for the starvation of 20 million soviet civilians , the allies did n't order their soldiers to shoot certain pows on sight . 
  go and read an / r/badhistory [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/27ibrv/clean_wehrmacht_and_robert_e_lee_in_one_post_guys/ ) mocking the idea of a clean wehrmacht . 
  they pop up every year this time because people like you do n't understand nuance . 
  the allies committed a small number of atrocities , none of them sanctioned by high command , all isolated incidents performed by individual soldiers . 
  the ussr is a special case but that 's because germany had just spent the last 3 years destroying their country and murdering millions of their citizens . 
  the wehrmacht alone killed thousands of civilians outside of combat , that 's not including the german government 's program of murdering millions . 
  the only reason i can argue this is because the germans lost , if the germans had won then this discussion would probably be illegal . 
  are you really using a following orders defence ? 
  that is literally what nazis at the nuremberg trials tried to do . 
  and wehrmacht soldiers also willingly killed thousands of polish and soviet civilians just because they could . 
  arguing for a clean wehrmacht is like arguing hitler was an ok guy . 
  did you read that list you posted ? 
  did you read just how few crimes there actually were by the allied forces ( soviets not included ) ? 
  have you forgotten that on the one hand the allies were fighting to liberate europe and on the other the axis were fighting for territory and the ability to murder tens of millions of people ? 
  you 're kind of coming across as a nazi apologist here that 's either trying to be edgy or does n't know their ww2 history very well . 
  it 's really not comparable . 
  the allied armies did n't have policies from high command about who they should murder , the allied high command also never stated their troops should round up and shoot thousands of german civilians . 
  oh , so this is just unnecessary then . 
  can we not link to official russian propaganda and use some real news sites to report this ? 
  you also jumped to conclusions with literally zero evidence just to support your prejudices , that 's what makes you islamophobic . 
  next time there 's a mass shooting in the us ( probably in the next few weeks because us gun laws are hilariously insane ) i can guarantee it 's a white guy . 
  what nobody will do is mention how all white people are at fault and how all white people are dangerous . 
  that he should be treated as any other french citizen and tried for the crime before a jury of his peers . 
  i do n't really see your point . 
  yes . 
  surely this would be communism , or a group similar to vanguard communism anyway ? 
  fascism and communism both have similar methods of rising to power , violence and intimidation . 
  people who are too stupid to not vote should n't negatively affect the rest of us . 
  and the only people who are islamophobic are also racist , you 're arguing semantics whilst being a bigoted cunt . 
  another white guy just went on a rampage in the us , why not start being racist about white people as well ? 
  i guess invoking muslims with literally no evidence should have its own law . 
  how about `` bigot 's law '' ? 
  was n't the biggest massacre of jews committed by a white christian from austria ? 
  or it could be a far-right wing group ? 
  that 's far more likely . 
  and yes it is racist , it 's pure speculation aiming only to stir up hatred . 
  racist comment made with literally zero evidence ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/264bgf/farright_fever_for_a_europe_tied_to_russia/chntf5m i 've got the guy tagged as a racist , it 's kinda sad how stupid some people can be . 
  and you get a `` racist '' tag . 
  thanks for making it so easy . 
  your comment reads like an excuse . 
  bigotry is bigotry , you 're just arguing semantics and missing the point entirely . 
  amusingly he had to mention that his party was n't racist because [ they had black candidates ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27274621 ) a few weeks ago .
