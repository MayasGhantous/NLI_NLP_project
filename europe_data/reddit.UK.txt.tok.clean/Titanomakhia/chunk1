i think his question was ` was it worth it for putin ? 
  if only ... 
  bastards . 
  more accurately , the conservatives play along , ukip are actively pushing that narrative , labour have done nothing to prevent it and the lib dems are the only party that denies it but they have their own political problems . 
   asserted that she was a great mother there 's as little evidence for that as there is for her other claims . 
  it 's also because putin is a gangster . 
  i doubt the us would ask for a ransom even if it did arrest an encroaching ship . 
  you 're right , sorry . 
  i was mistaken about the time frame . 
  when taken over 10 years , it would have represented about half of our contribution at the beginning of the decade and now represents a quarter of our contribution . 
  ~ ~ it 's also more than 2 times the amount it costs to be a part of . ~ ~ correction below . 
  i was looking across the wrong time scale . 
  a ukip politician called some of his own supporters ` sluts ' in a joke at their conference . 
  he left the party the next week . 
  good to here . 
  as someone who is pro-eu , in my opinion the most serious threat to the integrity of the eu is eu institutions undermining national competency and attempting to regulate things that are simply not supposed to be an eu competencies under the treaties . 
  it frustrates national governments and eu citizens all at once . 
  from a uk perspective the [ european scrutiny committee ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/european-scrutiny-committee/ ) regularly flags up documents which discuss issues where the eu is not competent under the treaties . 
  if we are seeking democratic legitimacy in the parliament then we should ensure the separation of powers and competencies if is done equally democratically . 
  if people knew for a fact that the eu would not extend it 's power without them having a vote on it i think people would be much less cynical about the eu . 
  do you think frans timmermans ' mandate to investigate subsidiarity and a ` less but smart ' approach to regulation will solve these problems and open up a route to moderate renegotiation for david cameron ? 
  do you think junker appreciates the danger that eurosceptic populism poses to the eu more than barroso did ? 
  i 've never understood this . 
  the song says nothing about kebabs . 
  you 're right . 
  prostitution is not itself illegal because the law tends to assume prostitutes are victims . 
  instead soliciting sex from a prostitute is illegal and brothels and other organising of prostitution is illegal too making it basically illegal in most cases . 
  a woman can legally accept money in private for sex but that 's about as far as is legal - curb-crawling etc in public is not legal making organised prostitution illegal . 
  the point here however is that the income from prostitution is not taxable in the uk whereas germany receives tax income from that economic activity offsetting it 's bill to the eu somewhat . 
  e : you 're not your, 
   the last couple of years have made that quite clear . 
  what specific examples are you talking about ? 
   the uk would be the eu 's largest export market after ttip is signed whatever the terms will be the us will far outweigh the uk as an export market for the eu . 
  equally if we begin to change our regulations in areas previously regulated by the eu we will make it harder for eu countries to export to us pushing all european companies out except the big ones who can afford to deal with the higher cost of trade thus reducing our importance to the majority of eu businesses as an export market . 
  it possible we will be a top export market for the eu at first but that will slowly decrease over time and within a few years we will be in the same position as any other country . 
  eu trade will represent ~ 50 % of our trade but only about ~ 5-10 % of eu trade making our negotiating positions unequal and we will probably be forced to accept unfavourable terms because the deal will be so much more important to us than the eu . 
  what a shame ... 
  yeah , i got confused thinking gmt was set by some reference to the actual time on the clock ( presumably at a specific point in the winter ) which would in turn refer to the position of the sun but it 's not . 
  it 's set by reference to quasars in deep space passing over the meridian line as the earth rotates according to wikipedia . 
  oops . 
  you 're right . 
  for some reason i was under the impression that mean solar time simply meant the time on the clock ( probably because it is also known as ` clock time ' ) . 
  but of course that ca n't really be true given the fact that we already change the time-zone in greenwich every year without gmt changing and if we moved permanently it would n't change either . 
  it 's possible gmt would just be moved because gmt is defined as simply `` the mean solar time at the royal observatory in greenwich , london '' so if greenwich changed time zone presumably gmt would change ( unless they changed the definition ) and central europe would technically be on gmt . 
  / sorry this is so long , i got carried away . 
   noone always gets a 100 % when so many interests come together , surely you ca n't expect that . 
  but that 's sort of the crux of the issue . 
  most typical conservative eurosceptics in the uk tend to believe that not getting 100 % of what you or your citizens want represents a tangible loss of control over your own policy in favour of non-uk interests which they see as undemocratic . 
  they would say that while you may suffer some economic damage to begin with at least the fundamental tenet of democracy is preserved namely that uk people ( not other eu politicians ) have ultimate authority over uk policy ( via representatives ) . 
  now it 's pretty hard to argue against that : its certainly true that if you leave the eu you would get 100 % of what you want because there would be no other interests to compete against . 
  it 's also true that these conservative types genuinely honestly do n't see themselves as european and never have . 
  one subtle element of conservatism in the uk has always been the belief that the nation state is the proper level of ultimate governmental organisation - international solidarity was always more of a trotskyist socialist belief that conservatives opposed . 
  when you see the world that way where the only legitimate authority for any nation is it 's national governing body then international law becomes impossible to accept . 
  especially where so long as that international law is in place , as with free movement of workers , the national parliament is not allowed to change it without leaving the organisation . 
  if a government is not allowed to change an aspect of policy because an international organisation says you ca n't it 's difficult to argue that that has n't taken quite considerable power from the national government which is unacceptable to nation state focused conservative philosophy . 
  in other words it 's not the immigrants it 's the fact that we ca n't control immigration even if 100 % of us wanted to specifically because an illegitimate ( to them ) international organisation forbids it . 
  now i think many people see that it is a slightly hypocritical argument too because any international organisation from nato to the un to the wto inherently means coming to international compromises and taking into account what other countries want . 
  every trade deal you sign is negotiated with the government of that country and will involve making compromises . 
  the only way you could ever secure total sovereignty over policy would be if you withdrew from international affairs completely like north korea . 
  however when it is as wide ranging as the eu people see the results first hand unlike with nato or the wto ( and if fed the right mixture of misinformation and scary half-truths by certain newspapers ) people will feel like they know enough and will decide to reject it not least because they do n't understand it and the fact that the eu makes little to effort to make itself understood to the public . 
  which eu politician is willing to come to the uk and explain why free movement of workers is needed ? 
  are they willing to go on tv , have a debate , be interviewed etc etc ? 
  this very rarely happens and when it does it 's often dismissive of eurosceptics as crazy people which just makes them angry . 
  farage gets more airtime than van rompuy , schultz , barroso and junker put together because he goes out there and tries to speak to people and persuade them unlike any eu representatives who are largely unknown and not respected . 
  how can you agree with someone whose never attempted to persuade you of anything ? 
  if they ca n't do that for all 500 million people then maybe that highlights a flaw in the system - too few representatives for too many people . 
  either way , ukip has tried to fuse that conservative ideology with the concerns of working people by blaming high house prices , low wages , pressure on social housing and medicine on low-skilled immigrants and suggesting that the reason we ca n't solve that problem is because our government is not allowed to change it 's own immigration policy . 
  the claims about low wage pressure are marginally credible but the other claims have been debunked but only by academic sources ; not common reading material among farage 's target demographic . 
  once you convince people they have someone to blame for their difficult circumstances they are hard to persuade otherwise and all you have to do is turn people to the eu and say ` that 's the real problem ' and people attack it . 
  when they ask politicians whether it 's true that we ca n't control our policies on intra-eu immigration the politicians have to awkwardly answer yes which seems to lend credibility to the whole argument when in fact it does nothing to prove that immigrants ( while they are free to come ) are the cause of people 's problems but the confirmation bias keeps people believing . 
  combine that with the fact that the current crop of uk politicians are about as unpopular as they can be and are not trusted at all following numerous foreign policy mistakes in iraq and afghanistan and a major new political scandal every year since 2000 [ \\ ( fraudulent expenses , accepting money for influence or official office , being influenced by media magnates etc \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_scandals_in_the_united_kingdom ) ( seriously , we 've had a new one every year for 15 years ) people are happy to vote for someone who 's not a brushed aluminium , former-public relations cyber prick like david cameron so they can shake things up and cause politicians to stop assuming a clever sound bite will persuade/trick people . 
  all that has created the current ukip . 
  it 's still possible for the ukip vote to disappear at the national elections in which case things might go back to the way things were but people wo n't be happy . 
  otherwise the eu will dominate uk politics for the next 3 years until we have a referendum on membership . 
  seems like it . 
   * declaration what offences shall be adjudged treason . 
  compassing the death of the king , queen , or their eldest son ; violating the queen , or the king 's eldest daughter unmarried , or his eldest son 's wife ; levying war ; adhering to the king 's enemies ; killing the chancellor , treasurer , or judges in execution of their duty * . 
   item , whereas divers opinions have been before this time [ in what case treason shall be said , and in what not  the king , at the request of the lords and of the commons , hath made a declaration in the manner as hereafter followeth , that is to say ; when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the king , or of our lady his [ queen ] or of their eldest son and heir ; or if a man do violate the king 's [ companion , ] or the king 's eldest daughter unmarried , or the wife , the king 's eldest son and heir ; or if a man do levy war against our lord the king in his realm , or ** be adherent to the king 's enemies in his realm , giving to them aid and comfort in the realm , or elsewhere ** , and thereof be [ probably ] attainted of open deed by [ the people ] of their condition : . 
  , and if a man slea the chancellor , treasurer , or the king 's justices of the one bench or the other , justices in eyre , or justices of assise , and all other justices assigned to hear and determine , being in their places , doing their offices : and it is to be understood , that in the cases above rehearsed , [ that ] ought to be judged treason which extends to our lord the king , and his royal majesty : . 
  i just think they are going back to when the law was created to make it sound archaic and cool . 
  each judge 's decision will have updated the meaning a bit including modern forms of treason etc. 
  it 's meaning through interpretation will have changed massively over the years even if the original text is still basically the same but it 's way more fun to say they 're `` going all medieval on his ass '' so to speak . 
  edit : also worth pointing out that treason basically guarantees life in jail whereas as the collection of minor terrorist offences someone might commit by planning a trip to syria might only warrant a few years . 
  if you can prove treason you can put them away for longer . 
  swearing allegiance to a foreign power seems pretty textbook to me . 
  it may be excluding seasonal workers . 
  i know lots of people from some baltic countries but also bulgaria and romania do farm work around harvest time but will only come for a few months . 
  if their only here temporarily they might not be ` usually resident ' . 
  their ally is the us . 
  that 's what they have on us . 
  and another : national opinion poll ( yougov ) : lab - 34 % ( -1 ) con - 32 % ( +2 ) ukip - 16 % ( +1 ) ldem - 9 % ( , 
  1000 ways to annoy russia : ... no . 
  467 : build a missile base in romania ... 
  i never knew it was related to a real man . 
  i had never heard of the word ` quisling ' until it was used in the thick of it :  ** jamie : ** nicholoson !, 
  the immigration shit , it was you , was n't it ? 
  you mimsy bastard quisling leak fuck !, 
    ** jamie : ** yeah , you will be sorry , you inflatable cock !, 
  then they throw chinese food at him . 
  such a good moment .
