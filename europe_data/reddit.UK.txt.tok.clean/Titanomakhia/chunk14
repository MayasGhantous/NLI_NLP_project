  finally , the reform we needed all along . 
   is this supposed to be the elite of britain ? 
  anybody with any skill or common sense avoids politics like the plague . 
  you can make more money , be more respected and do more interesting things elsewhere . 
  often when businessmen and journalists get to speak with politicians they often are shocked by how stupid a lot of these people are . 
  the reason , of course , is that the talented , intelligent , sensible people became bankers and lawyers and doctors and writers and business owners or any one of 100 other professions . 
  the rest became politicians . 
  the only people that get into politics now are people who crave power and ideological conflict . 
  occasionally you get people who are honest ( in the sense that they see power as purely incidental to their good intentions ) but those people get crushed by party political competition . 
  [ the recent publicity about harassment and blackmail in the tory party ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34901158 ) shows just what kind of environment these politicians were moulded in . 
  the people in power are only there because they managed to bully rather than be bullied . 
  to most people , ` ever closer union ' is tacit agreement that eventually we will all become one nation and the concept of individual european countries will be abolished which is not a politically popular idea in the uk . 
   i did n't realise we were so disliked by ~ ~ europeans ~ ~ a part of a tiny group of europeans who happened to be on an online forum at a particular time who represent at the most 0.000000301 of the european population . 
   there wo n't be a `` i do n't give a fuck '' option . 
  if there was an `` i do n't give a fuck '' option in all our elections , democracy would collapse . 
  lord ashcroft is pretty well regarded though . 
  i wonder who had the final say over how the data was set out . 
   it will likely to be reciprocal personally i fully expect it will be . 
  we ca n't have one rule for people in the uk and another for our citizens abroad . 
  depends on what context your name is being used in . 
  if your name is being associated with incorrect information or intentional lies then you 'd want to stop that happening . 
  defamation law exists , if you want to look at it this way , to allow people to control how their name is used public . 
  i suppose this is all using a definition of private that is very wide - perhaps `` personal '' would be more appropriate . 
  that 's the definition used in the uk with our data protection act :  `` personal data '' means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified --  ( a ) from those data , or  ( b ) from those data and other information which is in the possession of , or is likely to come into the possession of , the data controller , your name clearly falls within that definition so the use of your name by companies is quite strictly regulated in the uk as it is all over europe . 
  in fact i think it was an eu directive that prompted the passing of the dpa so uk law should be very similar in principle to other eu countries . 
  my point is that neither of us can speak for the entire country . 
  i 'm not claiming everyone feels european , that ca n't be the case . 
  you however are claiming that :  the uk 's never had strong feeling about being in europe . 
  surprisingly people have different opinions . 
  if you said a lot of people in the uk never had strong feelings on europe then that would make more sense but your statement is simply wrong . 
   only if we did n't join the eea if we did that then we 'd have free movement of workers and eu legislation to adopt all over again which rather seems to undermine the leave campaigns entire point does n't it . 
  the choice is leave totally and do n't join the eea or remain . 
  speak for yourself not the rest of us . 
  you have limited anecdotal evidence shaped by the people around you . 
  you have no idea how the rest of us feel , especially young people who have gone to university with erasmus students or travelled extensively themselves . 
  the generation born from 1980 onwards is the first generation where extensive european travel was not only cheap but common to do when your young ( interail ect ) . 
  it 's naive to think that has n't changed the attitudes of a large number of people . 
   arbeitslosengeld work loss gold ? 
  fuck , i need to learn german at the earliest opportunity . 
  she did n't write the legislation though . 
  she has armies of civil servants who should be telling her how bad this legislation is and will be . 
  maybe they 're brow beaten after 6 years but 1 person ca n't run a whole department , least of all a department as big as the home office . 
  we do n't discriminate . 
  we 'll ruin your idyllic medieval towns wherever they are . 
  he 's probably just wondering how to spend the last 3 and half minutes of employment . 
  you have a problem with misogyny and bullying in the muslim community not with sharia arbitrators existing which is fair enough ; i 'd probably agree with you . 
  having said that sharia courts do n't just exists to decide marriage problems , they mostly decide on business deals and commercial disputes . 
  there are specific rules in sharia law on commercial matters ( for example charging interest on loans is prohibited ) so there are plenty of reasons why they might find a private agreement based on islamic finance rules ( and pretty much every major financial institution has an islamic finance department these days ) more acceptable . 
  i have no problem with that myself . 
  if it solves commercial disputes before they end in an expensive court battle then great . 
  well it 's up to the individuals . 
  if they want to stick by the ruling then fine , if they do n't they can go to the courts where the ruling will be properly binding . 
   arbitration act 1996 you understand what arbitration is do n't you ? 
  a private agreement which must at all times comply with the law of england and wales . 
  you ca n't stop independent private parties coming to arrangements under their own terms unless they are doing something illegal . 
  if you have parties being bullied into arbitration rather than a court case then you have a problem with harassment and bullying not with arbitration . 
  after looking into it a bit it seems to be coming from a speech that jean claude junker made calling for eu countries to take migrants under a quota scheme rather than under the normal rules which require the country of entry to process migrants . 
  the only source i can find is the daily mail - i think this telegraph article is just going from the mail 's article because it was the mail that mentioned it first . 
  feel free to search for another source yourself . 
  the telegraph itself in the article it links to about the speech says that the quota system , via which we will apparently be forced to accept migrants excludes a number of countries including the uk so i have no idea why it 's being reported that pressure is being put on the uk when we 're already excluded - they 're interpreting a call by the president of the commission for eu countries to pull together and accept the quota system as pressure on the uk - no evidence the uk was even being addressed but that 's what they 're reporting as fact . 
  the eu ca n't control our deportation of non-eu citizens to non-eu countries so it 's nonsensical either way to say the eu would force us to stop deporting people . 
  i think they are getting the 90,000 number because that 's the number of asylum applications we had in 2015 . 
  so when they say :  brussels is forcing us to accept 90,000 migrants what they mean is that presuming the eu can control our borders in regard to non-eu migrants , which it ca n't , and presuming they stop us from deporting non-eu people , which they ca n't do , and presuming every single asylum application is accepted by the home office , which wo n't happen , then and only then would be have to accept 90,000 migrants . 
  feel free to find a more credible source for any of it especially the 90,000 number because i could n't . 
  if you find one then let me know because i hope i 'm wrong - i do n't want to believe they can stoop as low as to report such an insane unrealistic scenario as fact . 
  that turned into a bit of a rant but it just makes me so depressed that the press in this country is able to take a nugget of completely inoffensive truth and intentionally misinterpret it as aggressive persecution by the eu , jeremy corbyn , doctors unions whoever and they feed it to their gullible readers and just hope you do n't take 5 seconds out of your day to find out whether they 're talking complete shit and treating us all like 5 years olds unable to make up our own minds in the process . 
  and this is what 's going to decide one of the most important referendums in our country for 50 fucking years . 
  these dishonest hacks and their readers . 
  -------------------- edit : just thought i 'd quote this from the daily mail article this claim is drawn from just so we all understand the intention of the article . 
   meanwhile judges punched a further hole in britain 's porous borders last night ** by letting a calais migrant gang across the channel ** . 
   the immigration tribunal ruling -- justified on human rights grounds -- paves the way for thousands of similar claims . 
   the ruling concerned four young syrian men -- ** two under-16s and a 17-year-old and his mentally-ill 26-year-old brother ** -- all living in the notorious calais jungle . 
  yep that 's right . 
  they just called 3 children and a mentally ill man a ` migrant gang ' . 
  enjoy your weekend everyone , fuck me . 
  no it does n't . 
  like ... not at all . 
  well that depends on whether we refused people asylum before and the facts of those scenarios . 
  i doubt / u/janne-bananne knows the entire history of british immigration cases since the 1950s . 
  i expect most immigration lawyers do n't even come close to knowing that . 
  now i 'm just wondering why this has n't spread to the uk yet . 
  we 're already weird as fuck and constantly drunk anyway . 
  seems like a natural fit .

  if you go back all the way to the first parent comment and read every one you 'll notice that no-one claimed income inequality was a measure of poverty . 
  in fact no-one even mentioned the word poverty . 
  what one comment about did say is a `` a smaller portion of our population is poor '' the point being that income inequality when combined with gdp per capita measures is very helpful in determining whether most citizens are as wealthy as the average . 
  in the case of the us , per capita income is often higher but the average american is not making that amount and the lowest 5-10 % of earners are earning much less than elsewhere . 
  [ this new york times article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html?_r=0 ) has a really helpful graph which shows us and canadian incomes compared to 8 western european country 's incomes between 1980 and 2010 . 
  in fact the article is great too as it explains my point better than i can . 
  you can see that the highest 5 % of american earners are way richer than both the rest of americans and even richer than the other countries - they 're way out in front whereas the lowest 5 % are on par with spain and ireland but below canada and the other economies . 
  in other words the bottom 5 % of americans earn less than the bottom 5 % of french , germans , dutch , canadians etc. 
  the us population is certainly more rich on average but that 's only true on an individual basis if you are in the top 60 % or so of earners . 
  those in the bottom two fifths could move to one or more of the countries listed and earn more . 
  the edl were shouting about this because everyone was discussing it publicly . 
  that muslamic ray guns video is from 2011 , after [ this case for example ] ( www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-12137400 ) in which jack straw publicly talked about combatting pakistani rapists . 
  i do n't know where you have been for the past few years but the edl are not privy to any more information than anyone else - they are reacting to a stories in the press . 
  if you want to claim the edl were talking about rape gangs in rotherham in 2001 then i suggest you provide some evidence of that . 
  as much as you seem to like the edl they make the same mistake as you have .
