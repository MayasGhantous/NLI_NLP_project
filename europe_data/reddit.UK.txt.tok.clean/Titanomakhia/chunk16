  my local supermarket two years ago started selling ` polski ' bread and fuck , it 's delicious . 
  yeah , given the rules that already exist about police officers having to disclose their name and police station when requested it seems insane that they would allow officers to hide their face . 
  ca n't see this getting beyond an interesting discussion . 
  `` slaglana , more like '' . 
  spot on . 
  they have different editors and different teams ; they can be quite competitive too . 
  i think the mail on sunday 's editor and the daily mail 's editor hate each other - although maybe that 's the sunday times . 
  i read it in private eye . 
  there never were . 
  the daily mail supported the nazis in the 1930s . 
  i hope you can see why consciously going out and eating a big mac and unknowingly catching hiv are not the same . 
  not that i agree with the policy but the headline should read :  one nhs governing body responsible for an area around the city of york is to cut costs by delaying non-life threatening surgery until the patient loses weight . 
  it 's not the whole nhs , it 's not all surgery and it 's not denied . 
  this nhs body in york nearly went bankrupt last year and had to be put into special measures so this is part of their plan for their financial turnaround . 
  it would probably work if you paid from a spanish bank account which still had euros in it . 
  i 'm sure there 's a lot more trump could do in terms of domestic policy that would have huge long term consequences . 
  but yes , the negative effects of brexit will last a lot longer . 
  i do n't think we will rejoin ultimately - i think our future lies in being a tax haven and centre for money laundering in order to keep our head above water financially after our manufacturing industries have gone . 
  not much point in re-embracing free movement of goods if you do n't manufacture any goods to move . 
  i hope trump does win . 
  i do n't like being the biggest fuck up of a country and i 'd rather america takes the crown from us . 
  tariffs are low all around the world and getting lower . 
  the common eu customs tariff on wine varies between [ 7-10 pence on each bottle ] ( http://blog.majestic.co.uk/the-price-of-wine ) , it 's negligible . 
  non-tariff barriers regulation what may or may not be sold ( due to non-compliance with unnecessary and conflicting regulatory regimes ) is much more effective at stopping trade . 
  take the famous , at least among eu lawyers , [ cassis de dijon case ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rewe-zentral_ag_v_bundesmonopolverwaltung_f%c3%bcr_branntwein ) where an insignificant variation in the definition of fruit liqueur actually prevented one eu country from being able to market one of its products in another , not just making it more expensive . 
  the eu is designed to stop that and has been very successful . 
  in the same manner [ eu cars can not be sold ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/04/18/304540007/episode-533-why-cars-from-europe-and-the-us-just-can-t-get-along ) ( unless extensively and expensively modified ) in the us simply , because they have different standards - neither eu or us standard have been shown to be safer than the other but eu car companies still have to spend literally millions of euros re-designing their cars for he us market which makes eu cars expensive in the us and prevents smaller manufacturers from even being able to afford it . 
  tariffs by comparison are a minor problem that will be even more minor in 10 years , eu or no eu . 
  uk traders may have more choice but uk exporters will bare significant extra costs . 
  complying with all the regulations in other countries will be costly enough and will eliminate a lot , if not all , of the benefit gained by the extra competition or lower tariffs but those costs existed before . 
  the real worry is if the uk diverges from eu regulations ( as brexit campaigners obviously want use to do , boris johnson said this was his primary aim when campaigning ) than suddenly uk to eu exporters will face all those same costly problems simply to export products into europe where there were previously no such costs . 
  that will make uk products uncompetitive in the eu , lower profits in the uk and potentially harm jobs and the u.k. economy . 
  the only way you 're going to get benefits for the uk is if it adopts eu-like trade harmonisation policies with another bigger bloc of countries which is not only so difficult it 's almost impossible to imagine ( it took the eu half a century ) but that sort of international trade cooperation is exactly what the brexit vote rejected . 
  tariffs are irrelevant . 
  non-tariff barriers are what matter and without complying with a common set of rules ( like eu rules on goods and services ) we are setting up a giant trade barrier around our entire country . 
  the sun ombudsman . 
  the most meaningless operation in the country . 
  if reform is what leave campaigners wanted then we should have stayed and reformed the system . 
  leaving will tear the whole thing down by definition . 
  it does n't matter if he does n't want to punish people who have moved here , that is the logical result of his position . 
  in hindsight the username should have given it away . 
  the ftse 250 is still below where it was last month . 
  not that you 'd expect any shocks to be long lasting - nothing has changed after all . 
  the real downturn will come in 2 years time when we actually leave . 
  [ well at least we can now kill steel industry once and for all . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/03/tata-pulls-back-from-port-talbot-sale-process-after-brexit-vote/ ) if any of the people in that factory voted to leave i hope they got disowned by their colleagues - they might have just helped cause 4000 job losses . 
  i suppose but it 's a hell of a lot to count on - you have to effectively pray that the eu breaks up and scotland does n't leave within the next 5-10 years . 
  realistically scotland will try and leave before the uk even leaves the eu ( i.e within the next 2 years ) . 
  also until that 2 years is up the uk is not allowed to negotiate trade deals with third party countries because it is still in the eu . 
  maybe those rules could be relaxed ( what are they going to do kick us out ? ), 
  but we would still have negotiating to do and i do n't think pissing them off is the best plan . 
  either way i see a black hole - no good can come of this . 
  you 're allowed to carry pen knives provided the blade is no longer than 3 inches iirc . 
  glad you 're so confident . 
  `` breaking : swiss and uk sign ` historic ' trade deal . 
  the countries have agreed to trade pen knives for what remains of british industry . 
  i think the artist lost a finger making them all iirc . 
  yes it was on the liverpool echo website . 
  and yes liverpool voted about 60-40 to remain . 
  not sure how many of those views were from liverpool though and liverpool 's vote was in line with other large cities - manchester voted to remain too . 
  the eu trade commissioner did n't get a vote as to whether this would happen or not . 
  she 's just enforcing the rules we already agreed to . 
  rip uk agriculture . 
  yeah , it was featured by a local newspaper and a lot of people saw it . 
  clearly did n't made much of a difference . 
  half of his party fucked him by campaigning to leave . 
  not sure he 's in a charitable mood . 
  yeah , i was going to say . 
  ma nonu and conrad smith should be part of the deal . 
  ultimately it will have to be included in the formal brexit negotiations after triggering article 50 . 
  nicola sturgeon is intelligently getting in there while the government is in disarray and putting her case so that it 's harder for scotland 's position not to be an open question . 
  she has been and it seems will continue to be a few steps ahead of westminster . 
   this does not mean in any way that the united kingdom is any less united   scotland calls for independence   sinn fein call for reunification with roi top notch denial there boris . 
   i am in another eu country , so i did n't get to see the nitty-gritty during the campaign oh shit !, 
  i 've spent all day in / r/unitedkingdom and i just assumed you knew and were being stubborn . 
  did n't mean to come off as angry ( although i am a little ) . 
  i ca n't to link to the daily mail because it 's banned here ( for good reason ) and i would n't normally want to as it 's among the worst offenders in this game of misinforming the public . 
  however they have an article about voters who are feeling lied to and regret their vote . 
  http://www . 
  co.uk / news/article -3658563 / meet-bregretters-public-backed-leave-vote-say-want-stay-eu-one-admits-didn-t-think-vote-count . html just take the spaces out between the dots - hopefully that will get round the filter . 
  personally i have very little sympathy , the information was out there it just took a little effort to pick through it but there you go . 
  it 's done now . 
  come on . 
  that 's exaggerating what i said , is n't it ? 
  choosing to leave is fine , but not if you 're doing it on false pretences . 
  if you want individual lies then you can start with [ the one printed on their giant bus ] ( http://leftfootforward.org/images/2016/05/rsz_cikhd7axaaiklxc.jpg ) . 
  another is that [ we will be able to remain part of the single market without free movement of workers ] ( http://infacts.org/hannan-wrong-on-single-market-free-movement-link/ ) . 
  or how [ they linked non-eu immigration to the eu ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-q5w5si7bzj8/v11vqozr9ui/aaaaaaaatxw/e6vowe7gsaynzp-o-5gcubyekhnjt1zoqclcb/s1600/voteleave1.png ) to bring out to racist vote . 
  [ or turkey is going to join the eu within days ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/turkey-likely-join-eu/ ) . 
  penny mordant for example s [ tated multiple times ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36353013 ) that the uk could not veto turkey 's membership which was , unquestionably , a bare faced lie . 
  or how about [ the idea that we are consistently outvoted in the eu ] ( http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-06-09/fact-check-britain-outvoted-more-than-other-countries-in-eu/ ) - once again , bollocks of the highest order . 
  or maybe [ the claim that 75 % of our laws are made by the eu ] ( http://straightstatistics.fullfact.org/article/ukip-gets-its-facts-wrong-europe ) ? 
  i could go on ... 
   majority of younger people voted to stay . 
  younger people use google and the internet much more than older people . 
  guess who googled `` what 's the eu ? '', 
  i genuinely do n't know what to take from that other than you implying that younger people who voted to stay are now googling what the eu is ... 
   business partners run the numbers yeah but those numbers were lies . 
  people are n't upset with democracy , they 're upset that the public was manipulated and sold a fabrication . 
  you ca n't have a functioning democracy without a public that at least understands what it 's voting about .
