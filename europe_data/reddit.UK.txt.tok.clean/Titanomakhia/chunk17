  good . 
  do n't blame them . 
  leave campaigners sold people a lie that we would be able to renegotiate in our own time and from a position of strength . 
  the sooner people realise that we ca n't , the better - it will at least put the whole situation into a more serious context . 
   younger people use google that 's such a massive overstatement . 
  maybe that was true in 1999 but do you seriously believe that so few 40-50 year old use google as to have no effect on the results ? 
  also what about the children < 18 years old who are too young to really understand the situation ( or vote ) but want to know what all the fuss is about ? 
  but no , best to continue to slate remain voters . 
  anyone with half a brain cell was aware of that . 
  unfortunately ... 
   whatever happens , i 'll be keeping my eu flag flair . 
  changed mine just now . 
  i 'm such a rebel . 
  and we 've now got to live through this mess . 
  fuck this country . 
  how is the distribution of wealth within the uk , the failure of uk pubs or any of what you mentioned relevant to the eu ? 
  this is exactly why this whole refurendum has been a shit show - people have got no idea what they are voting on . 
  if people do n't like the government 's policies then vote another fucking government in . 
  do n't tank our economy and cut off funding for uk science out of some sort of misplaced anger at the conservative party . 
  you got that the wrong way round . 
  just over 50 % come from outside the eu . 
  i doubt non-eu immigration rules will be changed at all . 
  which is stupid because bankers will be fine , working people ( who are liabilities to their employers ) will not be . 
  we went from tory government 's who blamed everything on the eu to tony blair who supported/was too relaxed about the eu ( in regards the 2004 expansion migration or the lisbon treaty ) when arguably they should have pushed back seemingly confirming the existing tory narrative . 
  i know . 
  a vote in favour of an mop-haired right wing nutter that makes racial slurs about president obama just to gain publicity for his self-serving career is pretty embarrassing [ . 
  ] ( http://www.relatably.com/q/img/boris-johnson-quotes/boris-johnson-008.jpg ), 
  i 'm not sure it 's related though . 
  right wing nationalist attempts to kill a left wing politician - my mind does n't immediately go to brexit - seems to make some sort of sense without that . 
  [ and the official one . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/vote-leave-designated-as-official-eu-referendum-out-campaign-a6982491.html ), 
  britain first or [ britain first ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/britain_first ) ? 
  that accent is so accurate . 
  i 'm not the above poster but as a remain voter ( already voted by post ) i personally think we could be prosperous outside of the eu - i do n't think it would be the end of the world . 
  however we are a services economy now and we do n't export goods around the world at anywhere near the level needed to sustain our economy . 
  ultimately our prosperity come from companies wanting financial , insurance , legal or other services in the uk for the purposes of assisting international business . 
  if we want the uk to remain a centre for those services in europe and globally we will have to do a lot more to attract international customers if we 're outside of the eu and rules of export of services become more restrictive . 
  that will likely mean lower corporate tax rates , looser regulation , more financial secrecy and a lot more giveaways to banks and big companies to persuade them to keep a large part of their business here - it 's not economical for them to do so without that . 
  david cameron is talking about cracking down on tax avoidance but it 's perfectly plausible to me that we would have to effectively turn london into a tax haven itself in order to keep the money flowing - we would be like europe 's corrupt satellite state . 
  sure we 'd be prosperous , maybe more prosperous than now , like singapore with extra money laundering but i do n't really want to live in that sort of a country . 
  ironically the glass would be shatter proof due to eu product safety regulations . 
  yeah , it 's a bbc show . 
  it covers the institutions though and there are plenty of youtube videos on that topic . 
  of course !, 
  see [ my comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4lvktl/uk_voters_leaning_towards_brexit_guardian_poll/d3r0irs ) for some pretty un-biased , from what i can see , resources . 
  i may be naive given i have had the benefit of studying eu law academically but i 've never found it too complicated to understand the eu 's set up . 
  the commission proposes laws ( in the policy areas in which it is allowed to ) and passes it to the council . 
  the council ( national governments ) and the parliament ( directly elected meps ) make amendments and negotiate a final draft of the law . 
  there are two types of law : regulations and directives . 
  regulations are enacted as drafted by the eu . 
  directives are simply guidelines and national parliaments implement their own wording with their own laws . 
  regulations are used for uncontroversial ( often technical ) rules ( eg . 
  food safety ) . 
  directives are used for everything else ( eg . 
  the working time directive ) . 
  the european court of justice decides whether a law or government action ( eu or national ) breaches the rules of the treaties . 
  that 's pretty much it .

  edit : just saw your flair - obviously all this is uk focused but a lot of it will be applicable . 
  btw , if anyone is stuck behind the ft 's pay wall i will paste it but i 'm not a subscriber and it 's fine for me . 
   we need someone to step in and just explain everything about how the european union works . 
  there is so much information out there now on the internet and tv that if anyone still does n't know how the eu even works they can only blame themselves . 
  there has to be some responsibility on behalf of voters to educate themselves about the most basic elements of what they are voting about . 
  yeah but all the real supporters got too drunk and missed their flights . 
  this should be a capital crime . 
  thanks , that was fascinating ... and a little depressing at the same time . 
  and yet the ` appalling ' immigration figures still show that the majority of immigrants are coming from outside of the eu even at a time when the eurozone economy is bad and growth in the economies of south east asia ( including pakistan , bangladesh and india ) where most of our immigrants come from is between 5 and 7 % . 
  i know only two people voting to leave and one is a 70 year old uber-conservative who thinks donald trump will be the best thing to happen to america in a long time and the other is my mother . 
  every one of my friends is voting remain as is my dad . 
  i 've not seen a single pro-leave comment/post on my facebook but i see pro-remain stuff almost every day . 
  see in 2012 if we 'd have had a referendum leave would have won by a sizeable margin . 
  i 've been keeping track of the polling numbers for a long time and i like to put them into graphs ( because i 'm a nerd ) but also because it helps you see what 's going on over the long run . 
  i have a [ monthly average `` poll of polls '' ] ( https://i.imgur.com/lwj4z9a.png ) going back to the start of 2013 and also the same for [ the `` undecideds '' ] ( https://i.imgur.com/8mbf4ly.png ) . 
  what you can see is that : * there has been a trend towards remain which began in the autumn of 2013 and continued until early 2015 when they seemed to reach a stasis with leave on about 40 % and remain on about 43 % with the rest undecided . 
  * remain has polled higher on average every month since november 2014 but by only around 5 % . 
  * the undecided have declined steadily with a very steep drop off since the beginning of 2016 seemingly favouring neither side . 
  some of the points from 2013 and 2014 only consist of one poll so are n't going to be super reliable as a measure of public opinion but they tended to be consistent with each other at least . 
  edit : anyway , my reason for posting was that remain is not that far ahead and the undecideds still exceed any lead they have by 3 times at least . 
  and this does n't account for turnout which will likely be lower among younger voters who tend to be more pro-remain . 
  do n't know enough about it to comment much but from what i do know it has the right mix of powers . 
  this stuff will always be sensitive to nation states because no-one wants to give up any autonomy on security . 
  the best bet is to co-ordinate rather than replace organisations to get the best of both worlds which looks like what europol manages to do . 
  sure , i could see it as a kind of information sharing body that would co-ordinate police operations in cross-border cases but it should n't have it 's over officers with arrest powers etc. 
  this would be a waste of money imo . 
  there were chances to prevent brussels or paris is only the security services were properly funded/sharing information between countries . 
  is n't that the point of the eu , that we break down borders and co-operate ? 
  unity in diversity . 
  not centralisation . 
  this article seems very one sided but i do n't know enough ( certainly have n't read the documents myself ) to dispute much of the narrative . 
  if the commission really wants this deal they need to publicly defend it and explain in detail why this interpretation is wrong and why jobs will not be lost with numbers and independent reports to support that conclusion . 
  until then they and ttip are doomed . 
  i 'm quoting the calculator i linked . 
  i would assume it 's making the relevant standard deductions although it may not be accounting for the tax credits received . 
  but then again neither is the uk one . 
  you would be eligible for working tax credits in the uk as well as child benefit and if your salary was split between two adults you would pay almost no tax at all as each individual gets the first # 10,600 they earn tax free . 
  you likely need an accountant to work out which is better after all the possible welfare receipts but the calculator is all i 've got to work from . 
  i believe so but by poverty they do n't mean homeless or starving - they mean low wages . 
  their definition of poverty in the uk is a 2 adult 2 children household earning [ # 18,564 ] ( http://www.cpag.org.uk/content/uk-poverty-line ) ( $ 23,607 or $ 26,909 ) .
