  older people thought they had seen the end of soviet aggression in 1991 and younger people were n't alive before the late eighties to see it the first time round . 
  lots of people had reasons to be optimistic but putin has single handedly reverses 25 years of political progress for russia and isolated his country from the international community - he 's just preparing the ground for yet another total collapse of the russian state , unfortunately for the people who actually live there who will be poorer in the end and will have to endure dictatorship in the meantime . 
   the big , scary , surprising , number here is france : 16 percent of those surveyed say they support isis ... ( the poll was commissioned by russian state media , almost certainly to tar and/or troll western countries , but that does n't make the findings any less disturbing ) it kind of does actually . 
  rt is a propaganda organisation not a news organisation . 
  exactly . 
  there are several failures of one sort or another every year among the tens of satellites launched over the world . 
  it amazes me that people can know so little and shout so loudly . 
  i wish basic argumentation was taught in schools around the world . 
  it would prevent people like this just coming up with whatever random bullshit they conjured up that morning and deciding that it 's makes logical sense . 
  if people were taught how to spot flaws in arguments they would tend to make fewer flawed arguments and we 'd have fewer videos like this which seems to merely consist of flawed argument on top of flawed argument on top of incorrect fact on top of misunderstanding on top of flawed argument . 
  i would love to hear some genuinely intelligent criticism of the eu ( because i think it would improve it ) but it 's so rare . 
  in a way the lack of any competent criticism might be bad in the long run because politicians need to be reminded that they 're idiots every now and again to remind them who they work for . 
  instead videos like this just weaken any legitimate criticism because they 're just so dumb - actually that 's not fair because some of the things he mentions could be good arguments if he just changed the way he says them - their just misjudged and often incompetent . 
  if the wattage has no effect on the actual operation of the vacuum then what 's the issue . 
  your just asking to be allowed to buy an identical vacuum cleaner that costs you more in electricity . 
  it 's a technical specification like requiring fuses in plugs or safe packaging . 
  yay !, 
  i know electric bikes sell well in turkey because the age limit on riding motorbikes applies specifically to motorised vehicles and thus electric bikes do n't apply and even kid 's can ride them as if they were motorbike . 
  it might be the same in some other countries where electric bikes are an alternative to motor bikes . 
   [ i 'm very disappointed in you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcsuptl.gif ), 
  right because the commenters on a european subreddit are indicative of the zeitgeist in america ... / s if you watch us media you 'll see that it 's americans most of all that have been shocked by the aggression of the response by the police . 
  why else do you think al sharpton can sell out a theatre just to make a speech condemning the police ? 
  why do you think obama had to talk about it and pretend everything was ok not after the shooting but after the police response ? 
  it 's because there has been an up-swell of public anger against this and that anger is being responded to . 
  so basically ...  mohammed most popular name in england !!!!,

    it 's the end of the world as we know it !!, 
  well , i , for one , am truly shocked . 
  why would someone do that ? 
  on reddit of all places ? 
  \\* shakes head *, 
  some of them are constitutionally unable to arm the kurds . 
  i would n't try and cast this as a moral dilemma because most countries are going about as far as they can within their constitutions . 
  pretty good year for english and british sport . 
  won the women 's rugby world cup and the juniors rugby world cup , topped the medals at the commonwealth games and the european athletics tournament , crushed the indians at cricket in 5 test series . 
  it all makes up for the utter shit show at the football world cup . 
  just wish we could have beat the all blacks at least once last spring . 
  the sanctions on trade with russia wo n't help either . 
  it will be interesting to see the figures for summer and autumn . 
  it did and does . 
  the difference is that italy is expelling this guy to morocco and when he 's there he 's not going to be tried for a crime by authorities which have tortured people and may use evidence of torture against him so it 's much easier to do . 
  the problem with abu qatada ( which i presume your thinking of ) was that we were n't just deporting him , we were sending him to a criminal trial in jordan where the jordanian government were almost certainly going to use evidence obtained by torture against him which is a flagrant breach of human rights and something that would ( hopefully ) never be seriously considered in a british court . 
  if we would n't do it at home i personally do n't think it 's ok to send someone to a nasty regime in the middle east to have them do it instead . 
  the cia 's black sites and other relationships with violent security forces in dictatorial countries has caused all sorts of diplomatic problems for the us including with us because some suspects were detained indefinitely at a us base on the biot , which is a british dependency of some definition . 
  we would be doing the exact same thing ourselves by sending qatada to jordan without a promise by the jordanians that they would n't use evidence of torture against him . 
  we have been effectively expelling the british fighters in syria too by removing their passports . 
  lots of people get deported through the normal channels all the time but it rarely gets headlines because it 's probably not as eye catching , rightly or wrongly , as muslim preachers yelling hateful things about jews . 
  they exist in the same way democracy exists . 
  as concepts that we have adopted as fundamental to our way of life specifically because they make living in our societies much better . 
  read thomas paine or john locke on natural rights . 
  they tend to link rights to justice in that rights are those interests which promote justice between people . 
  john locke would say that if you have worked on some land or some object and fundamentally changed it it 's is just that you can own that item and call it your own thus you should have a right not to have that item confiscated from you including by the government . 
  there are various ways you can define these concepts , and they are just concepts , but our whole societies are made up of concepts . 
  the idea of parliaments or governments or leaders or laws or money or contracts - it all just arises out of the particular concepts we accept as valuable . 
  human rights are among those concepts and so you could say they do n't exist but you 'd also have to say that there is no fundamental right to democracy that we suddenly discovered nor is there any fundamental reason why i should obey any law . 
  just because they do n't exist like objects does n't have any baring on whether we should or should n't have them . 
  ukip , i assume , want to use this idea as some sort of argument against the concept of human rights but as you can see it does n't really work because it 's a non-sequitur . 
  just because something only exists as an idea or a principle has no baring whatsoever on the validity of that idea . 
  beef wellington with a good beef fillet is the best thing ever . 
  importing meat into the uk is really hard but i know someone in dubai who can easily get hold of south african beef fillets and ... jesus it was good . 
  for desserts , you ca n't go wrong with banoffee pie . 
  he 's going to be all torn up . 
  why does n't another country offer to buy it . 
  france gets the money , an ally ends up with a warship and russia is damaged . 
  it 's a win/win/win . 
  i believe it 's around 30 % supporting independence compared to 45 % against but the ` undecided ' section is almost around 25 % . 
  microsoft 's own formats . 
  it cost the government a lot of money to get all the licences . 
  this should be free or partially free . 
  if new saxony was a country it would be one the richest countries per capita in the world being so small but having london inside it . 
  the uk foreign secretary summoned the russian ambassador ( as did the australians ) . 
  i think/hope there is a recognition that things have changed and action is really needed . 
  but there are still bodies in a field in ukraine which need to be recovered , no-one knows where the black box is and no-one has total proof it was shot down by the rebels even though every piece of evidence points that way . 
  that information is crucial especially if we want to blame russia - we will need evidence that putin can not deny . 
  time can seem to go much faster on the internet because the headlines change every 6 hours on here but in reality the newspapers and politicians are working on a 24 hour cycle . 
  give it time and hopefully we 'll see some action . 
  someone who is incredibly insecure and thinks the world revolves around them - i.e putin . 
  this is the second time the conservatives have been confronted by reality and disappointed . 
  they ordered a review of the balance of eu/national powers and the report concluded the balance was about right and the eu was hugely beneficial to the uk . 
  very embarrassing . 
  it 's unfortunate because i expect david cameron agrees with the conclusion of the report but he 's playing politics pretending to dislike the eu to prevent the complete collapse of his most ideologically supporters . 
  while i 'm never a huge fan of having foreign policy dictated to european countries , as it all too often is by the us , she is right . 
  europe has been stalling and has not been nearly as harsh on russia as the situation dictates . 
  if this were somewhere else in the world then we would be condemning it forcefully . 
  many countries have good reasons mainly to do with energy security but hopefully now we can find a way to get around those problems and find a harsher solution . 
  the uk does n't have any good reasons apart from not wanting to give up russian investments in the city and we should be the first to threaten russia . 
  a. . . andy ? 
   there has n't been a successful ** hostile ** invasion of the british isles 1688 was technically a successful invasion but it was invited by parliament of course . 
  * winning world cups, 
  is n't that what everyone thinks ? 
  i was barely aware they did anything other than those things . 
  yes but by a court that does not have the power to affect national laws passed in this area . 
  the ecj has the power to punish countries that make laws that violate the treaties and it also has the power to strike down eu made legislation if it violates the echr ( which is not part of the treaties but something the eu must abide by ) . 
  it does not have the power to affect our own laws should they breach the echr - only the european court of human rights can do that and even then it 's only a request that we change the law . 
  it 's kind of like , to take a random country , an italian court ruling that a law it passed breached the echr . 
  that decision has no effect on the uk nor on how uk judges decide if we passed the same law nor on how european human rights judges will decide . 
  both sets of judges could take the decision into account though and decide to copy the other court . 
  the problem is that we were relying on the eu law to make our use of phone records by police legal . 
  that 's been changed suddenly and it 's suddenly become illegal to collect that data . 
  no doubt there are ongoing court cases , future court cases and investigations into syrian fighters going on right now and the government really does n't want to lose the phone records .
