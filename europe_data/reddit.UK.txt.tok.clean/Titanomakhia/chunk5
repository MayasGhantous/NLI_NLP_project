  she 's written about how she will never avoid tax because she values the welfare state and how it helped her and wants to repay it ( which she has many times over through taxes ) . 
  she 's a long term labour voter . 
  so i guess that does n't really fit your theory . 
  well , all i have to go on is norway and switzerland both of whom have adopted large swaths of eu law made exclusively by non-swiss or non-norwegian people in order to participate in the common market . 
  so not only do i think this is what would happen but all the evidence from other countries suggests this would happen too . 
  the common market is a harmonisation of trade rules intended to make trade easier . 
  if you want to participate in the common market it goes without saying that you must adopt the common rules all of which are made or conceived at eu level . 
  it would n't be a common market if it 's rules were not ... common . 
  but everyone in the efta would enforce laws made by the federal european state ? 
  because that 's what is happening now . 
  i do n't see how that 's much of an independence . 
  the fact of the matter is we can either stay in a potential federal state have a say in how laws are made but have the eu legislating on certain things we feel should be state matters like defence or we can continue to follow the rules of products and services of the union but have no say or vote on what they will be while regaining our defence policy . 
  both are pretty shitty options if you care about being ruled by ` the evil brussels bureaucrats ' . 
  if uk people want to make the sovereignty argument , which apparently lots of people do , their only future option is leaving the common market altogether and being enable to sell goods or services in the eu and they should embrace that . 
  if it 's defence policy or energy policy you care about the efta will do fine but we 'll still have our trade rules decided by the eu which would now be a foreign country . 
  exactly . 
  i really doubt he 's going to expand beyond ukraine though he will probably attempt to take over ukraine with his proxy forces . 
  the us wo n't get involved until he moves with conventional uniformed forces or moves outside ukraine so he 's just decided to do it all through convenient rebel uprisings in the east . 
  putin does n't want a war just as much as the us does n't want a war . 
  soldiers dead is never good pr and putin is sure to get beaten so both side are going to avoid confrontation until putin has east ukraine and then everything will calm down . 
   seems like a loss to me seems like a loss to most people who actually understand the situation . 
  this is going to really confuse anti-immigration euro-skeptics . 
  it 's eu money so we should hate it but is cutting immigration so we should love it . 
  [ what am i supposed to think !, 
  ] ( http://www.picgifs.com/reaction-gifs/reaction-gifs/mind-blown/picgifs-mind-blown-1995183.gif ), 
  poland can into new !, 
  i 'm not saying they ca n't print it but i am saying it 's exaggerated and designed to get people unjustifiably angry and manipulate them to do what the editor 's political agenda requires . 
  the headline and all the content . 
  they were n't citizens ( and i think it only really applied to the eldest child ) but they had been legally resident for 7 years + which under the current immigration rules means deportation can be refused if unreasonable . 
  it 's quite complicated i think because were talking about splitting up a family . 
  the fact that at least one of the children ca n't be removed means any deportation will have to split the family up so the legitimate residence of a child can mean the parent is not deported in order to keep the family together and not traumatise the children who are , of course , innocent . 
  [ here is a dl link for the full appeal judgment . 
  ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/dimuux9d94e63in/da007992013.doc ) it 's only about 10 pages long a lot of which can be ignored . 
  the original judgment allowing leave to remain is not available to the public but the appeal judge summaries the original facts and decision . 
  to cut a long story short the kids were legally resident in the uk and could not be removed from the country . 
  wrt the mother , she could be deported but according to social services :  `` if [ gha ] is deported , the whole family will feel the stress of the separation . 
  this type of stress can have a detrimental effect on children , causing anxieties and affecting childhood development . 
  deporting [ gha ] will have an impact on her children 's future successes , including things such as their school achievements and earning as adults '' . 
   a report from gha 's probation officer dated 19 august 2013 stated that she had displayed `` exemplary behaviour and commitment '' whilst on licence . 
  the home sec knew the case was weak and unlikely to succeed :  the judge noted that the secretary of state 's decision was not in line with her own memos in the gcid case record , including a note from a senior caseworker to the effect that the argument for refusing leave was weak under zh ( tanzania ) and that in considering the best interests of the children the ukba needed to consider their welfare and stability . 
  the caseworker had stated :  `` given the above consideration i think a judge would look at this very harshly if we were to refuse either the applicant or the children ... ''  first tier tribunal judge shamash concurred [ that ] ... the failure of the secretary of state to address the fact that the minor children were subject to a residence order as `` incomprehensible '' . 
  she found that there had been a failure by the secretary of state to make adequate enquiries in relation to the children before reaching the decision to refuse their applications . 
  she pointed out that the decision under appeal in their case ( just like the decision in gha 's case ) failed to attach any weight to the residence order , and failed to have regard to s. 55 of the uk borders act or to their best interests . 
  on carrying out the appropriate balancing exercise under article 8 , the judge concluded that the decision was disproportionate . 
  art 8 is one part of the decision ; un conventions are involved and lots and lots of domestic uk law . 
  in fact the decision seems to be based almost entirely on the welfare of the children not on her . 
  instead we get a bullshit headline like the one above . 
  nato requires 2 % of the gdp on military spending . 
  the us spends 4 % . 
  nato is not making the us spend that extra 2 % . 
  the us does not have to have a base on every country in the world to defend the north atlantic . 
  the fact that the us chooses to have military bases in every patch of earth possible is their prerogative if they want to spend the money . 
  the us wants to dominate the entire world militarily , control the pacific and the middle east . 
  most other nato countries want to defend their own land , nato land and perhaps want the ability to intervene through alliances in north africa or the middle east should there be rectifiable humanitarian atrocities there or the safety of their country is threatened . 
  why are the military spending of these two compared - they are n't measuring the same thing ? 
  one is the cost of nato defence and the other is the cost of total domination . 
  also does it count as free-loading when you are n't given a choice to reject it ? 
  is there really any need to have 23 usaf bases in the uk ? 
  can the raf not do the job ? 
  why 23 why not 20 or maybe just 10 ? 
  is the uk 's security so dire and the lack of other bases in other countries so extreme that they need to be so concentrated ? 
  it do n't think so . 
  in fact it seems like protection of allies is a secondary consideration and instead allies are used as forward operating bases for wherever the us decides it needs to attack ; which would be fine if we want it that way . 
  has the public * ever * been able to decide whether they want us airbases dotting the country ? 
  has the us public * ever * been able to decide if it want 's to spend 16 % of it 's budget on the military ? 
  the extensive operation of the us military is totally without democratic mandate by the us people ( because there exists no candidate who would limit the military ) or by the people 's whose land is [ either taken forcefully ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chagossians ) and replaced with us bases or suddenly turns into a flight path . 
  there is a widespread consensus in washington and in every nato-affiliated capital that the us military should police the world and that allies will assist this . 
  no politician since vietnam has offered an alternative and the american public has thus been unable to chose us foreign policy for about 50 years . 
  in the us it 's called [ the national security consensus ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/05/the_national_security_consensus ) and in europe it 's called nato . 
  no-one has been consulted and yet we 're supposed to be so humble and grateful because we 'd be overrun by some unexplained enemy without the glorious protector ? 
  and to question this consensus is to be free-loading and na\u00efve ? 
  i 'm pretty sure no-one in europe would oppose military cuts of the us military so their government should n't worry . 
  we 'll get through it - it 's not like we had a choice in the first place . 
  i think the main reason many britain want 's out of the union is because the main parties and the treaties are all explicitly federalist . 
  the union is and always was intended to supersede nations and eventually become a continental government . 
  the eu institutions do n't talk about this much as it 's sort of taken for granted that the nations of the eu have already agreed to this goal in principle which they have n't really . 
  if you put the concept of a federal european state up for a vote right now i do n't think most western countries would be up for it . 
  it does n't help that the uk constitution does not in principle allow federalism to happen . 
  parliament is sovereign and can not be bound beyond one parliament and thus being subject to ultimate government from somewhere else is unconstitutional . 
  that 's not to say we could n't change the constitution but naturally that would receive huge opposition from traditionalists and conservatives and others besides . 
   most of the terrorist attacks in france and across europe as a whole were committed by separatists , notably corsicans . 
  does this include basque terrorists ? 
  i assume so . 
  or militant farmers blocking roads ? 
  it all really depends on what you define as terrorism . 
  that 's just plain wrong ... or the first bit is . 
  the ipcc , not an alarmist source but an independent un panel that has pretty much nothing to gain or lose by being biased , said in it 's 5th assessment report that the sea levels will rise up to 0.98 metres by 2100 . 
  but it also said at p. 29 of the first working group 's report summary that :  sustained mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise , and ** some part of the mass loss might be irreversible ** . 
  there is high confidence that sustained warming greater than some threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more , causing a global mean ** sea level rise of up to 7 m ** . 
  current estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1 \u00b0 c ( low confidence ) but less than about 4 \u00b0 c ( medium confidence ) global mean warming with respect to pre-industrial . 
  in other words if the mean global temperature rises more than 4 degrees the greenland ice sheet sea is pretty likely to all melt causing a huge rise in sea levels over 1000 years . 
  now you may not be worried about changes that happen after your dead but this planet will be basically uninhabitable except near the poles in 1000 years unless we start acting . 
  as they say some of this may be unstoppable even now . 
  the problem is not so much whether the earth will survive because it will , its just a hunk of rock . 
  the question is whether our cities and our economies and markets will survive the extreme weather and the fact that places that are currently habitable and fertile and have been for a 1000 years will not be habitable in another 1000 years . 
  the effects will not just be warming but the stopping of atmospheric currents , stopping ocean currents that circulate oxygen for sea life , decrease in air quality , interference with the water cycle and the carbon cycle and increases in the number of extreme weather events like hurricanes , droughts , famines and cyclones . 
  remember these events cost money to fix . 
  we lose , according to the ipcc , around 200 billion usd every year from extreme weather events . 
  that will only grow and our economies will have to deal with it . 
  remember we are n't talking about temporary warming or something we can get back to when it gets bad .
