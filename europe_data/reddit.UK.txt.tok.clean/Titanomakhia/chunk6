  it 's a run-away effect like a chain reaction that gets faster and faster and faster the longer you wait . 
  the warmer the sea gets and the more ice that melts the more stocks of co2 and ch4 that are trapped in ice and absorbed in water is released . 
  meaning the warmer it gets the more greenhouse gasses are released from the earth itself . 
  the ocean is a huge co2 sink , it absorbs a huge about of co2 but the warmer it gets the less gas is capable of being dissolved . 
  when you drink some cold carbonated drink like coke or something it fizzes up in your mouth - try it . 
  the reason is the sudden change in temperature is causing the gas to bubble out of the liquid . 
  that is what happens to the sea as it warms - co2 bubbles out and less is absorbed . 
  at some point we will reach a moment where more co2 is being released from the sea and from trapped deposits in ice that we are released and at that point climate change will be genuinely unstoppable . 
  more and more gas will leak into the atmosphere and we could leave earth all together and it would have no effect . 
  the white ice sheets on the poles would also stop reflecting light as they melted meaning more sunlight would be absorbed heating the planet even more . 
  the earth would get hotter and hotter eventually killing all life on the planet . 
  look at venus if you want an example of the greenhouse effect gone bad - 462 \u00b0 c on the surface . 
  and then soon after the complete submerging of the south and east of england , all of denmark and netherlands and also the entire polish coastline . 
  sounds fun to me !, 
  he 's a really hateful guy as well . 
  when the us was all in a tizzy over obamacare ( read : communism ) he went over and took the lucrative opportunity to appear in every right wing us media format that existed under the sun and spoke at the conservative political action conference in the us about how much he hates government provided health care , how the nhs is entirely shit and the us healthcare system was marvellous and the best thing since sliced bread . 
  you would even be able to count the number of times he 's been on shaun hannity 's show . 
  may dad voted for him as well . 
  i do n't even think he knows who the guy is but he voted none the less . 
  they did that 2 or 3 years ago though . 
  they 're not in coalition in the ep ... 
  i do n't think it 's david * ` here 's a referendum please do n't vote ukip ' * cameron you need to persuade . 
  pretty much every european group supports the concept of federalism in the eu and it 's that that scares a lot of eurosceptics . 
  you need angela merkel on side too . 
  exactly . 
  i 'll quote european commission itself :   ** eu rules -- the facts **   first , it is important to note that the eu rules have all been agreed by all member states , including the uk . 
    ** rules on free movement **   eu citizens have a right to stay in the uk , or any other member state that is not their own , for up to three months with a valid passport or identity card . 
  but to stay for longer , they need to be :   * in employment ; or   * continue to seek employment and have a genuine chance of being engaged ; or  * to be able to show that they have sufficient resources not to be a burden on public funds and sickness insurance . 
    in other words , as uk immigration minister mark harper recently put it in the daily mail : [ `` european nationals do not have unrestricted access to the uk . 
  they must be exercising their treaty rights . 
  this means they must be working , studying or self-sufficient . '' ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2269838/migrants-medical-insurance-wont-nhs-care-ministers-tough-stance-new-influx-east.html )   individuals can also be excluded or expelled on the grounds of public policy or in the event of abuse or fraud . 
    the full and exact legal provisions are to be found in [ this eu law adopted by the european parliament and by national ministers in 2004 . 
  ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=consleg:2004l0038:20110616:en:pdf )   ** rules on rights to claim benefits **   to get a full picture of how the eu rules work , we need to distinguish between two categories of benefits :   * social assistance benefits -- such as income support or housing benefits -- are typically means tested and given to people in need . 
  these benefits are not financed by contributions paid by the individuals , but through general taxation . 
   eu citizens who are workers or self-employed in the uk ( and their family members ) are eligible for social assistance benefits without any conditions . 
  that is only fair as they contribute , like all other uk workers , through their taxes to the public funds from which the benefits are financed . 
    conversely , eu citizens who are not employed should not be eligible for these benefits as eu law requires them to have resources higher than the income threshold under which the benefits are granted . 
    * social security benefits are granted to provide cover against the classical social security risks -- sickness , maternity and paternity , accidents at work and occupational diseases , old-age and invalidity , unemployment and having to assume financial responsibility for a family . 
  depending on the social security system of the member state in question , they may be financed out of contributions ( in the uk for example state pension and contribution-based jobseeker 's allowance ) or out of general taxation ( in the uk for example healthcare in the nhs )   again , eu citizens who are workers or self-employed persons in the uk ( and their direct family members ) are entitled to social security benefits on the same terms as uk citizens , provided that they meet certain conditions established by national law , such as for example reaching the retirement age for an old-age pension or having made sufficient contributions for an unemployment benefit . 
    on the other hand , eu law says that before eu citizens not active in the labour market become eligible for social security benefits they have to pass a strict `` habitual residence test '' proving that they have a genuine link with the uk . 
    this test has been agreed by all member states , including the uk , [ under this eu regulation . 
  ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2009:284:0001:0042:en:pdf )   in practice , a significant number of those who pass the habitual residence test have worked and paid taxes in the uk for a certain period or are living in the uk as a direct family member of someone working . 
    ( the full criteria eu member states should apply under the habitual residence test include the duration and continuity of the person 's presence in the member state concerned ; the nature of any activity pursued , including its stability or whether it is habitually pursued and the duration of any work contract , the exercise of any non-remunerated activity ; the person 's family status and family ties ; in the case of students , the source of their income ; the person 's housing situation and its permanence ; and in which country the person pays tax . ), 
    these criteria for assessing habitual residence are strict and thus ensure that only those persons who have genuinely moved their centre of interest to a member state are considered habitually resident there . 
  this is a powerful tool for the uk and other member states to make sure that social security benefits are only granted to those who are entitled to receive them . 
    of course , in order to receive those social security benefits that are directly linked to a certain length or value of contribution , eu migrants must also meet those criteria as well as the habitual residence test . 
    so reports that the european commission is insisting that the uk should provide benefits for non-active eu migrants `` from day one '' are quite simply untrue . 
    what is true is that the commission , as it is legally obliged to do under eu treaties and rules to which the uk has signed up , has formally asked the uk to cease applying an additional `` right to reside '' test specific to the uk and which goes beyond the habitual residence test agreed by all member states . 
    in many cases eu nationals living in the uk are indeed receiving the social security benefits to which they are entitled . 
  but applying this additional right to reside test is depriving some other eu nationals living in the uk , in full compliance with eu rules and within the strict limits set by those rules , of social security benefits to which they are entitled . 
    in many cases , these eu nationals have worked and paid their tax and social security contributions in the uk , yet are still being refused benefits . 
    the fact that the uk continues to apply this test means that it is applying different criteria to eu nationals in the uk than those being applied to uk nationals resident elsewhere in the eu ( of which there are up to two million according to some estimates ) . 
    ** rights to national health service ( nhs ) treatment **   first , eu law certainly does not make the uk a safe haven for eu citizens who would like to come to get healthcare at the expense of uk taxpayers . 
    those who come for short periods , for example on holiday , can receive basic and emergency care , by using the european health insurance card ( ehic -- formerly known as an e111 ) . 
    however , under the ehic system , that care is ultimately paid for by their own member state of residence . 
  such visitors are in general not entitled to non-urgent treatment for existing medical conditions and neither are they entitled to come to the uk specifically to obtain nhs treatment . 
    eu law on the coordination of social security systems provides that those eu citizens -- and only those -- who can show that they are either employed or self-employed in the uk or non-active but habitually resident in the uk ( see above for the criteria ) are fully entitled to treatment by the nhs on the same terms as resident uk citizens . 
    uk law is in line with this principle and does allow eu citizens who are genuinely resident in the uk to have full access to nhs treatment . 
    uk citizens in other member states have access to state funded healthcare systems there on the same basis . 
    but the uk does not recognise entitlement to nhs treatment as comprehensive sickness insurance cover within the meaning of eu law on free movement of eu citizens . 
  it is on that issue that the commission launched `` infringement proceedings '' ( legal action ) in 2011 against the uk . 
    in the commission 's view , eu law requires that in assessing whether a non-active eu citizen should be entitled to remain in the uk under the free movement rules , the uk authorities must consider nhs cover -- if the person qualifies for it -- as sufficient sickness insurance , without requiring them to obtain private insurance . 
  it is worth emphasising again that the mere fact of being present in the uk is not enough to ensure qualification for nhs cover . 
    eu rules do not prescribe to eu countries how they should set up their national health-care systems . 
  they can shape those systems as they see fit and the only obligation is that they can not discriminate against eu citizens from other eu countries . 
    like a number of other member states ( spain , portugal , denmark , sweden , finland ) , the uk has decided to set up a scheme which does not link entitlements to individual contributions . 
  the eu has never been only a free trade area . 
  it always involved some sort of supra-national organisation . 
  need i remind you of the schumann declaration which began the idea of inseparably close co-operation in europe :  [ the french government ] proposes that franco-german production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common high authority , within the framework of an organization open to the participation of the other countries of europe . 
  the pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development as a first step in the federation of europe , and will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war , of which they have been the most constant victims . 
  need i remind you of s. 119 of the treaty of rome which enshrined equal pay for men and women for the same work from 1957 on or which was committed to a common market not just free trade from the get go . 
  a common market is not just free trade , it 's harmonisation of regulation and getting governments to change their rules on good and services and other area to make them the same as everyone else 's . 
  that was the idea in 1957 and that was what the uk signed up to in 1972 . 
  trust me , it 's actually quite shocking to a lot of us brits as well . 
  you really underestimate the ability of people to be led by ignorance until it happens around you . 
  i think he 's still a bit upset about being made to look like an idiot by putin over chemical weapons in syria . 
  he needs to sound virile or something , puff the chest a bit . 
  in a country with an incredibly high cost of living thus relatively it 's more sensible than it sounds . 
  edit : i calculate that a living wage in switzerland would be around 13 $ or # 10, 
  cameron just wants to make sure his flagship little morality crusade against pornography does n't get overturned . 
  the filter he has ordered isps to offer blocks all pornography not just illegal pornography . 
  the important part is that it is opt-out ; it 's assumed that all internet users want a filter . 
  in reality of course the isps simply ask you if you want it and it 's very hard to be filtered without your consent . 
  however if cameron is forced to make the filter opt-in then he will basically have backed way down from his original position and will lose face to the prudish religious types he seems to think will win him the next election . 
  it depends if the ` without prejudice ' clause will allow an opt-out filter of all 18 + material and i 'm not sure it does . 
  government ordered blocking of content is not necessarily contrary to the underlying principle of net neutrality . 
  it 's not the isps differentiating between the speed you get content and consequently charging customers more , it 's a government mandated filter which must be voluntarily consented too by the internet user which blocks access to certain material . 
  do n't get me wrong i 'm not in favour of that either but it does not affect isp customers unless they want it to affect them and it does n't violate the core concept of net neutrality , namely that at no extra cost you should be able to get access to all of the internet delivery as a universal speed untampered with by the isp . 
  the problem in the us is that customers get shafted having to pay isps and then having to pay more for netflix because it 's forced to pay for access . 
  that 's not what were talking about here . 
  hopefully after the election the government 's tone will change somewhat . 
  i think i 'm basically saying the same thing as you . 
  i just hope they clarify the difference between things the public should be able to know and stuff that , as you say , was never newsworthy like some guy getting kicked out of his home because otherwise it could be used to silence people who want to publish information in the public interest . 
  again i have n't actually read the judgment so i do n't know how it will be interpreted . 
  journalists should be able to publish information without the consent of politicians if they can uncover corruption etc. 
  if it 's newsworthy it should be available for the public to find . 
  equally if recently convicted sex offenders are required by law to have their identity known while on probation etc then they should n't be allowed to hide their conviction so as to be able to get away with whatever they did again . 
  the difference is when the information is not true or serves no real purpose by being public other than to humiliate and hurt someone . 
  we should n't prevent the public from knowing stuff they should know . 
  i have n't read the judgment yet but there is an important distinction that should be made that the author does n't seem to make .
