  yes , eu is kill . 
  car manufacturers as well . 
  the japanese told the uk that the only reason they have factories there is because of the access to the eu .

  not much to report util tomorrow .

  there 'll just be a royal rumble , and the winner gets to be the king/queen of the use . 
  there is n't a viable solution for the eurozone without reform . 
  austerity was the only option , since traditional means of recovery were n't available to the eurozone , it has n't worked and has been detrimental in some cases . 
  i know which i 'd prefer . 
  it was a figure of speech . 
  i doubt most people know how the value of their currency impacts economic recovery ( or lack there of ) . 
  post ww2 the uk used a 2.5 % inflation rate to reduce its debt to gdp from 240 % to 33 % , while increasing public spending and creating things like the nhs . 
  hyperinflation does erode people 's savings , but controlled inflation does n't really have that effect . 
  you have youth unemployment in the periphery economies at over 30 % . 
  youth unemployment in italy and spain is at an unsustainable 40 % and 45 % respectively . 
  i doubt they 're consoled by the euro 's `` practicality '' . 
  i 'm sure they 'd rather prefer their own printing presses and central banks , so that they can devalue or inflate away their problems , but instead are pegged to a currency that better suits germany and france . 
  the euro is fiscally unstable in its current form . 
  the financial crisis proved the euro was a terrible idea . 
  the only option i see for it going forward is federalisation or something similar . 
  you could scrap it completely , but the economic fallout of that would be seriously bad . 
   however , the `` telling lies '' must be fixed in the future . 
  things to do . 
  * stop politicians lying . 
  & nbsp ; & nbsp ; good luck with that .

   just because it 's called the south china sea it does n't make it property of the chinese like the persian gulf does n't belong to iran or the gulf of m\u00e9xico to m\u00e9xico . 
  right , but it 's not exactly off the cost of california is it ? 
  whenever the us has a tussle with russia or china it 's always outside their respective backyard .

  you guys are the most hawkish country in the world . 
  you 're currently deploying troops in eastern europe to piss off russia , you have regular clashes with china in the south ** china ** sea . 
  of the 248 armed conflicts since the end of ww2 , 201 were started by the us . 
  and right now us special operations forces are involved in 134 different countries . 
  and to top it off the us was voted the biggest threat to world peace in a recent gallop poll .

  that is probably a coincidence . 
  leave have been gaining momentum for a while now . 
  it 's a comment on an internet forum , not a treatise in economic theory . 
  obviously it 's more complicated than can be put across in a couple of sentences . 
  tell that to those whose job and skills are made redundant by it . 
  the problem with this round of automation is that , rather than chipping away at the bottom causing the whole job market to shift up , it 's eating away huge chunks of the middle . 
  and you do n't have to automate everybody 's job for it to become a big problem . 
  not all automation is bad , and not all bad automation is bad in the long term . 
   when a business has to adjust to a crisis , it can recalibrate by lowering salaries and firing workers . 
  in a country or in the eu ,  when all businesses do that , what happens is that each business is laying off another country 's consumers . 
  that 's the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics it 's one of the contradictions of capitalism , that all businesses try to reduce the cost of production ( e.g. 
  salaries ) while increasing demand for their product . 
  that 's why automation is such a big problem , because if everyone creates their products via automated means , then who is going to buy them ?

  i agree , with the small exception that ukpolitics is nearly all men . 
  it was just a lame joke .

  yeah , i really do n't get this mentality of * `` putting two fingers up to politicians and big business '' * . 
  after a brexit big business can relocate , and maybe they earn # 200ml this month instead of # 300ml . 
  the prime minister will still be a millionaire , as will his chums . 
  the people who will get fucked by a brexit are the same people who beckon it on while thumping their chests and spouting nationalist nonsense .

  the un charter that makes it illegal to invade another country without a security council resolution , was created and signed after the second world war . 
  it is n't retrospective from the point the law was enacted , because otherwise you would have nearly every country trying to sue each other for every invasion since time began . 
  china 's only military base in africa is in djibouti , a democratic republic . 
  and when it comes to doing trade with countries of dubious governance , the west probably should n't throw stones in glass houses . 
  but the chinese are n't doing it against the will of the local government . 
  that 's the difference . 
  plenty of places in the world have foreign military stationed on their soil ; u.s. bases are scattered across europe , , the uk has bases in germany and cyprus . 
  if china wants to invest and build infrastructure in an africa country , and the african country is ok with that , then what 's the problem . 
  if the country ca n't offer adequate protection for a facility , and they agree to let china do it for them , then what 's the problem ? 
  i think you 're seeing deviousness where there is none . 
  no , but it 's what you glaringly implied in your response to my comment . 
  see my edit . 
  so whenever a country is n't doing too well , then that 's a green light for foreign countries to invade them ? 
  let 's hope the eurozone does n't have another financial crisis , otherwise you 'll all be chinese by the end of it . 
  * sigh * see my edit . 
  foreign investment ! = colonisation, 
  you want me to refute the forced colonisation of an entire continent , presumably against their will , by europe ? 
  seriously ? 
  you ca n't think of a single reason why that is a bat shit stupid idea ? 
  & nbsp ; ** edit ** since a lot of the replies are practically the same , i 'll just post something here . 
  firstly , foreign investment is not the same as colonisation . 
  in the uk we have power stations owned by the french and chinese , and large factories owned by the japanese ; that does n't mean the uk is `` colonised '' by those countries . 
  if you 're saying europe should invest in africa , then yes , i agree . 
  actually colonising africa , i.e. 
  creating a colony in a foreign country and subjugating the locals , would be a stupid idea for the following reasons ; * it 's illegal under un regulations . 
  * it would create numerous wars on many fronts .
